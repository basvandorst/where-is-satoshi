i like to fantasize prof bitcorn knowingly portrays the absurd antithesis. 
an intentional sacrificial to garner attention to the cause

u support sites u want. no censorship by credit card companies/paypal, no global boundary

If the NY btc regulations become law, would we be able to fork bitcoin from it?

u can do anything with anything, make any kind of agreement but u cant really impact the main bitcoin system itself like u can with fiat banking

There is definitely more security though. You're personal information (whether it's credit card, address, name) isn't out there for someone to abuse (data mining, hackers, etc).

y not both? for ppl that have limited tech savvy, and just want to store small amounts, they can use coinbase wallet
for ppl that want to pay directly from their own wallets, they have that choice too

To avoid censorship. (Wikileaks-blocked by banks, credit cards, paypal, etc. Charity/kickstarter funding that gets blocked by paypal)
Keep your private life more private. Buy vpn with btc.
Patron and tipping. Ease of support and pseudoanonymity. Video game streamer/deviant art artist/camgirl/youtube musician/etc. 
Online services. Paying or getting paid. Now that we have an extremely useful way of transmitting payment without the burden of banking and identification, we're going to discover more applications and exchanges of online services. 
No age barrier. No global barrier (aside from merchant shipping capability and import laws). You have bitcoin, you can spend it. Youth entrepreneurs who want to protect their earnings from spendthrift parents.
If using coinbase, then a superior paypal replacement in terms of control. You aren't at that much financial risk of online storage if you only buy and store $100-1000 worth of btc at a time. And you still have the option to pay from your own non-coinbase wallet to a btc vendor.
As a way to validate agreement among non-localized entities. Very scalable. 
More ways/reasons will show themselves in the future. Growth is shared among the coexistence of things.

I feel like the whole thing was just a masquerade of reaching out to the community, pretending to accept your input while already firm in stance, attempting to charm you to lower your defense and fight.

On a windows system running a virtual machine, if the main OS is infected, can it affect the virtual machine?
And, how feasible would it be to have a virtual machine dedicated solely for btc transactions?
Currently, I have a separate system for btc usage.
