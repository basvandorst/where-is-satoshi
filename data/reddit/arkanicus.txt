I registered and accepted and still nothing. Did yo get Dogecoins from dogetipbot?
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:10:50
Should have invested in Dogecoin.....WHY WHY DIDN'T I GO WITH DOGE! Maybe it's not too late?
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:31:21
Sweet I'll be a duel role doctor and have $10,000. Cheers!
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:14:31
Thank you...how does the tip bot work? What do I do?
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:42:27
Any minute someone will buy it and I'll be one step closer to being debt free!
[Yup..any minute](

EditEditEdit: Such sorry. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:18:55
Much thanks!
Such help.
Edit: Did I do it right?
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:51:11
Good on ya fellow-fellow shibe. Here:
+20 doge
I think I tipped away everything I was tipped. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:54:39
It still seems pretty summer in here to me. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 06:42:22
was it kraken?

You think you're a toupee wearing sack of shit that funnels money away from his dying businesses to his other businesses? You inherited millions of dollars initially but after decades still have near what you inherited because you lost all your gains on stupid decisions?
@_date: 2014-03-27 06:31:25
My guess on  is "What is a kraken?"
But didn't work when I used it. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:15:33
500 now... Don't care I'm rich in Dogecoin now. Such investment!
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:37:49
I gave you the tip...my whole tip. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:25:04
My question was bad and I feel bad. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:23:11
Oh man I finally sent in $75 to Libertybit yesterday I hope it goes through by the time this tanks. Cheap bitcoins for me!
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:25:30
I'll check those out. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:20:54
I'll buy some off you. Pm me the price you want and I'll accept or counter
@_date: 2013-05-29 19:10:52
I'm new to this. What are the IG Markets? Explain your prediction to me like I'm five. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:08:12
Not making fun at all. It's not a lot of bitcoin/money and you'll learn lots from playing with it. 
Best of luck. 
@_date: 2013-07-30 05:29:53
It was a lot of fun. Met some interesting people. I'll try to make the next one as well. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:51:35
Yeah I got a million hairs. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:35:23
Hey I turned your 16.83 into $31 by shorting it and buying back plus some bets. 
Thanks again!
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:50:48
That actually sounds like a sweet job. 
and here I am (an engineer), just sitting behind my desk jerking off...oh wait. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:30:38
Wow thank you very much. You really didn't have to. Thank you :)
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:38:07
No, just wait a year and it'll be back up higher. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 03:38:43
I did. I made 100 bucks from that. Which is nice. It was a hard decision between reinvesting it into bitcoin or paying off a bill. 
New grad so I know I got dues to pay until I'm living middle class. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:28:01
spread the love. I helped too. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:34:50
Yeah it seems that's the best way to get more people to use bitcoins.

@_date: 2013-12-07 06:05:52
You uhhh bought at a terrible time. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:32:03
What would you say be a good starting amount to invest? Mt.Gox said that anything less than $75 won't amount to much in the account because of bank wire transfer fees. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 19:21:53
Thank you very much. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 06:07:08
If I had bitcoin I would give you some. But unfortunately I'm very very poor. 
Wow. Such currency. Much poverty.

I was worried about this. I've made about 2-3 bucks from mining but we'll see next months hydro bill. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:06:36
I want an even 0.1BTC. You fly up to Canada and we'll make a deal.

What makes peercoin different?
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:54:53
It will hit at least 300. Dude sell sell sell. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:52:36
Are you kidding? I bought like 900 when it was worth pennies and forgot about it. I honestly forgot everything about it. So you're saying it'd be worth $174,600?
Edit: I finally got ahold of it. My scumbag brain played a trick on me. It was 0.09 not  900. I don't know where that came from. Welp..i'm poor again. 
I'll just wait till this crashes then buy bitcoin for the next bubble.

You're lucky, my desk sits on me.

Are you really a billionaire?
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:24:15
