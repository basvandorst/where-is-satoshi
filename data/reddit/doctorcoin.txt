You can ask any questions. When you create a question, you leave out the category field blank. That's alright. As soon we have many questions on a particular subject, we'll create a category for it.

I think Google Chrome, for instance, automatically translates all pages. So the simple UI on the site could be automatically translated by the browser. Questions and answers, however, require human attention.
I think many Russians and Ukrainians could use an advice from foreign doctors, who are usually more qualified. Thus, I'd be happy if the site gets popular in these countries too. CoinMD team has no idea how to market ourselves in these countries. My hope is that locals who speak English could help us spread the word while actually making money translating questions and answers.

We'll implement a language filter. In the meantime, you should just check the frontpage once a day to see if there are new questions in your language. Any non-english question will have a "Translate" button.

Not trying to defend it, but "permission" and "bitcoin" don't fit quite well.
@_date: 2014-08-12 14:31:05
For those of you confused, it's a successor to CoinMD and Coinlaw websites. We now made it open for all kinds of questions so please feel free to participate and earn bitcoins by providing great answers.
@_date: 2014-02-08 07:06:29
Oh, alright, I didn't know.
@_date: 2013-10-28 15:07:03
Yes, but not now.

We'll certainly have a feedback system and we are going to be a lot more open about our vetting process. Please understand that we have to start small and navigate our way through this. However we do believe anonymity is the key. We do not believe suing doctors solves the healthcare quality and control problem and we don't believe reputation and expertise need to be tightly coupled with real IDs.
@_date: 2013-10-28 07:16:58
Then you claim your money back. We'll review your question and doctor's answer with other doctors. If we find that the doctor who answered your question was not doing the best job with the information he got from you, we'll happily refund you.
@_date: 2013-10-28 06:18:29
1. The question you really want to ask is: how do you know the answers are good, professional and helpful? And you know that by looking at them, because they are public. For instance, if you can't read code, you still trust Bitcoin because you know the code is public and read by thousands of programmers. If someone learned medicine in some Cambodian jungle and is able to answer to questions as intelligently as a licensed doctor, then I don't see a problem with that.
2. The liability question, I think, is a very important one, but it's misunderstood. Doctors are very often reluctant to recommend a certain less safe course of action because they are afraid a patient may sue. I think anonymity, while possessing certain additional risks, also adds options that are not available to patients traditionally. I believe people have both the responsibility and the freedom to choose what they want. If you are afraid of being mistreated, don't ask for advice online, but I do think it's wrong to forbid others to do so.
@_date: 2013-10-28 07:42:59
Yes, we work in the medical field. You can't just sign up on the website and start answering questions as a doctor. We'll test you and monitor your questions. As the site grows, the approach to testing and assessing will become more systematic.
Also note that each question may be answered by multiple doctors. So if one doctor sees there's something utterly wrong with the answer - or maybe if he simply disagrees, he will probably point this out in his own answer.
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:48:28
Hm, I thought this is obvious. In order to receive an advice from a lawyer, you have to pay first.
@_date: 2013-10-28 07:49:08
I would like to stress this out again: if liability is a primary concern for you personally, do not follow any advice online.
@_date: 2013-11-08 04:21:52
1. Connections + lawyers emailing us.
2. All questions and answers are public and open to peer-review. Thus, anyone, including other lawyers, can verify if an answer is qualified. It would be pretty unavoidable for us to go out of business if our answers are unqualified.
@_date: 2013-10-28 06:35:33
It was a contrived example.
You have to recognize that licencing is not some magic bullet to make all doctors safe. Ultimately, senior doctors decide if students are good or bad and if they pass the test or not. Government simply sets additional rules (sometimes, very stupid) and grants those pieces of paper called licences. There is no reason why another organization cannot keep track of the doctors experience and reputation and allow other doctors to assess them. Government is simply a monopoly on the consumer protection market and I don't think anyone would argue that monopolies are usually not good for customers.

Help us grow 
We don't really need money, but we need some help getting exposed to a larger audience. If this is something you know how to tackle, please contact us.
@_date: 2013-10-28 05:43:57
The plan is to keep questions free, but ask people to donate before they receive an answer. That way, when doctors sort through the questions, they will be able to see pre-paid ones and will have incentive to answer to those questions faster and elaborately. In short: free market and fair price, no forcing.
@_date: 2013-11-08 04:13:44
Also, guys, we would really appreciate it if you posted a link to our site in your twitter or elsewhere. We need exposure to make it fly. Even if you don't need to ask a question on the site, if you believe it's a good idea, please share it with other people. If you write an article about us on some fancy traffic-loaded site, we're gonna hunt you down and lawyer you up for free!
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:11:14
Both sites take commission. Apart from that, your money still goes to lawyers directly and immediately. In the case of CoinLaw, we simply decided to insist on paying forward a bit more explicitly, although it's still voluntary - you can create a question and not pay.
@_date: 2013-11-08 03:46:54
1. We're not sure if this is becoming a network yet. It's pretty difficult to tackle each field and gather experts from it.
2. Yes, it's coming.
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:29:00
Thank you for the insight. We'll have to think about this whole thing. The possibilities sound very interesting indeed.
@_date: 2013-11-08 00:58:33
Thank you, that's a great idea. We'll implement it.
@_date: 2013-10-28 07:00:35
Please note, that's why it's called advice, not treatment. Our site is about advice. It is unfair to say that advice has the capacity to hurt people to the same extent that a real treatment has. I would argue, an advice has no capacity to hurt at all, only action (or inaction) by a person have.
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:52:21
Yes, we would be interested, however it is too early to tell how to get into those fields. The demand is uncertain. With regulated fields it's easier, because we know that when a government interferes into something, prices are almost guaranteed to be higher than they should be.
