Onetime reg fee + 1% cutoff? 
Way too expensive

Maybe buy it on an exchange like everyone does?

Could be true...
but the more people know about Bitcoin the less upwards potential exists....
the last bullrun was the opening of cryptos to mainstream recognition (everybody was talking about) - it was huge because everyone wanted to be a part of the lambo community...now time has a little bit changed - people (without technical knowledge) are aware of spending lots of money into Btc and others because most traders got burnt last year...another point is that the „dreaming sequence“ ended with the start of the big crash in jan 18 (people now know about pros and cons)...the next bull run will be based on adoption and real use cases (maybe not bitcoin - we don’t know yet) rather then dreaming of big gains which will be more likely a steady and slow increase of Btc price (if at all) ...
-&gt; compare it to 3D printer they are used widely but in another way everyone expected in the beginning 
So - personally - I don’t think we will See a comparable bullrun like it was in 2017 but if Btc will survive we will se a steady and healthy growth on longterm - but I would appreciate a big run in 2020 xD  
A big catalyst could be institutions in big scale, extended use in official pensions for longterm invest for retirement, easy to use solution for problems like lost of priv keys and so on....
Today we are living in a crypto world that is trying to solve a trust problem but as we could see in the past, crypto world is struggling with exactly this problem but in another way (exchanges lost private keys, scams, banks blocking payments....)
A trustless setup is nothing worth until people trust the setup - and today they don’t really do...
Just my 2 sats

Yes but to send payments via ln you have to be connected in anyways to the receiving address...if you open a ln now for buying an iPhone you would send it directly and leave it open...if you buy another item at Microsoft with the same ln channel your payment will be processed through the existing ln channel through ie apple which redirects the payment through their channel with Microsoft...so in this way apple acts as an intermediate...so your solution is the same as my solution...different Eis you don’t call it intermediate because of the crypto given stigma of intermediate
As far as i understood it - isn’t it like that?
@_date: 2019-04-22 20:47:17
I said „maybe“...and my solution is way better than to open a channel for every payment just to close that channel after the payment is done ����‍♂️����‍♂️
If you want to waste time - no one holds you back from doing so...but it’s far away from efficiency
@_date: 2019-04-13 20:33:47
Ok then you should look closer to the charts...it’s useless to post every update of the coins values bc we all see it in our portfolio or online...and as I said 2 % are faaar Away from getting interesting...check the charts
@_date: 2019-04-22 21:14:22
Yeah but as the nodes are redirecting / routing payments - they are intermediates (communicating / connecting part(s) between two endpoints) ..your videos are explaining exactly what I said...
You could open a ln between you and the particular company or even having an open channel that routes the payment to the particular address...
@_date: 2019-04-13 20:55:05
:D where exactly did I insult you ? ...I just mentioned that this is a useless post with no evidence...and who are you that you can say „all you have to say...“ xD ? - if you are here just to get confirmation to your opinion you should post it anywhere else where people don’t know about crypto movements...

Since the owner of the atm can adjust their provision and choose their Plattform to handle the exchange it’s not equal in every location/atm 
@_date: 2019-04-14 12:59:08
Maybe it was a forecast ��

Buy p2p
@_date: 2019-04-13 20:11:11
Useless post
@_date: 2019-04-13 20:26:19
Maybe...but 2% difference in one day is far away from decoupling...
@_date: 2019-04-22 21:36:32
Okay then we got each other xD seems like it was a misunderstanding because of the word I used (not a native �� the German translation of intermediate is like „connecting thing between two points or things“ or „thing which connects two or more things“
@_date: 2019-04-22 19:55:05
That’s actually an interesting point....opening a channel requires confirmation and fees - (time &amp; money) ...from that point I only see an advantage for costumer if they want to buy regulary to save some fees, or if the costumer subscribed a service on which he has to pay more than once...
Maybe the solution is an intermediate with open channels to many shops...if someone wants to pay via ln, he only has to connect to a ln which is connected to many shops...on this way someone could save time and fees by opening just one channel to the payment processor (ln) they want which routes the payment to the specific payment address
@_date: 2019-04-22 20:34:08
I don’t see you having a better idea...and making false claims tells me you don’t really know how ln works ��
@_date: 2019-04-22 20:49:17
I got your point...but why should I open a channel for ONE transaction (bought something once)...it takes the same costs with more time
@_date: 2018-11-25 04:05:58
I move 50 cents and pay no fees xD maybe you are at the wrong bank ������

Everyone who wants to release him from jail...you know that he hired hitmen and that not only drugs were sold at Silk Road ? 
You should think about again whether such crap of human being should be in jail or not...

Kraken - best exchange ever
@_date: 2018-12-16 20:34:55
Agree ^^

Not everyone who owns assets has to choose between assets and their house...
but the recession will be a big problem for any kind of asset...on the other hand recession is the time where rich people are formed - so take the chance and invest wisely the next years :) 
@_date: 2018-12-11 20:35:15
This guy is doing it wrong ...he is fomo buying when price rises *facepalm* xD 
@_date: 2018-12-16 22:16:44
Useless comparison...stockmarket is x times bigger than the crypto market...it would be more useful to compare the losses in percentage...but   This would also not be a real indicator for anything as the crypto market is still new and still lacks of mass adoption and real value these days 
@_date: 2018-12-11 23:25:36
Did I say that I never did? No. But I never had a reminder that told me that the price rises to buy then - because it’s stupid. I always bought at regular intervals ;) price averaging you might heard of it ;) 
You don’t have to be angry with me just because  you bought Btc at 20k xD 
@_date: 2019-05-04 17:14:36
Maybe it would have been better to gather information before depositing your money anywhere to buy anything you don’t understand ������
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:58:26
@_date: 2018-12-16 19:48:58
Correct...but I also said that I will be a good time those who don’t have to be worried about their houses...
Personally, I prefer not to worry too much as i don’t need the money the next decades - every recession causes a lot of damage - if you invest in any asset you should be aware of it anyways....and smart people are already prepared for recession times and do cost averaging during recession to profit from the hard days when they are over
