Enjoy your time as much as you want crypto-bears. But we all know [this guy]( is coming for you!

It needs to go down, there was too much hype and too many people came who don't care about the tech.
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:45:32
Savages :D
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:12:40
Yep. And then they will switch to bidding of price going up. And then moon.

That's true. They use USD, was the same here (in Bulgaria) in the 90's when our currency collapsed (2 times - 91' and 97'). We were using USD and Deutsche Marks. I guess it's just easier for the avrg person to use that than Bitcoin and also it is perceived as the less riskier currency. 
When someone asks me about Bitcoin I usually recommend them to get some in proportion of the inflation. I.e. if 5% inflation it's a good idea to have 5% of your assets in BTC. This might be a bit extreme in Venezuela's case though :D

You might be right. But also there are interesting things going on now. Like the fact that central banks are buying gold with a rate unseen since 1971 ([ what are they preparing for? We've got a decade of free lunch too - ([ the grey zones are past recessions)  , that should end well, right? :D
I am not an expert on macroeconomics but something just feels off.
@_date: 2019-03-15 10:25:36
Ah, that's easy. Just don't sell! ;) 
@_date: 2018-06-29 20:00:51
I agree. Micropayments are a huge deal. 
Though in the near future I cant see an issue with sub 1000$ as well. Just needs more nodes with bigger stakes. I've opened my chanel with just 20 bucks.

"human can't distinguish anything subsecond"   
I disagree with that one. :) 
Try 0.3s  - [
vs 1s [
Just hit run and then hover the mouse on top of the square.

Was less than a second for sure. Try it on your own, I've paid for this [ using Eclair Wallet.
@_date: 2018-06-29 15:04:29
No. I dont think the capacity of the avg node will allow that yet. But atm I wouldnt mind doing 300 on chain.
@_date: 2018-06-29 19:48:26
Second layer is the only option. In regards to bitcoin being a store of value, yes it is, but if it fails to deliver scalability it will never gonna get to gold valuation. I think this bear market is screwing too much with some membrs. Stop thinking about the price guys, there is a bigger picture here.
@_date: 2019-06-20 08:43:13
It's spiking because Fed is signaling for a interest rates cut.

Get a Ledger Nano S hardware wallet (or any other popular hardware wallet).  You can use the Nano S with the phone as well so don't worry about portability. Or you can move small portions to the mobile wallet just for spending. 
You should advice your boss to use a hardware wallet too.

Improvise. Adapt. Overcome.
@_date: 2018-11-07 10:35:36
No one knows probably. But just by looking those two bears it seems they are different, caused by different factors. They will act differently but my thinking is the 2018 one will be more related to fundamentals. We need to see better tech + adoption growth in order to overcome this one. LN almost feels ready to blow but it doesn't. It improves a lot by the day though. Adoption is not in a great shape too.
But as I say, the bear looks tired. A few right shifts in the fundamentals could be the nail to put it down.
@_date: 2018-11-30 10:12:05
Absolutely, but you still need to open/close channels which is an on-chain transaction. So 50M active users on LN opening/closing channels once a week will result in a demand for \~80tx/s.
There might be another solution rather than on-chain scaling but this is the only suggestion I found int he LN white paper ( I might be getting wrong though...).

"Off topic", really? It is not only right on the topic, it's the whole point and reason for Bitcoin network to exist! ....

There are two major bottoms IMO. One at 4900 and on at 1200. I am waiting for a sign from the miners too though, I want to see total recapitulation from them and this could signal we are and the ground zero and preparation for the bull run are at place. No doubts in my mind there will be a bull run though, it just might take more than we wish (could start this summer or the next).
@_date: 2019-01-08 08:32:25
!lntip 10   ( I wish it was supporting a 1 sat tips, could make a solid point with that :D ) 
@_date: 2019-01-17 08:26:25
Solving the hyperinflation problem is a core idea and feature of Bitcoin. This is not off topic...   
"Censorship resistance" is another one BTW.
@_date: 2019-01-04 16:23:54
Didnt know that. I was trying to make a point by tipping 1 sat. Anyway, thanks for the info.

Never margin trade bitcoin. Too much volatility there and it's too harsh on your sleep. :D
It will probably sink more. But once the water is clear those sleeping bulls will wake up and will give it a run not seen before in history.

I totaly agree about centralization. But I am thinking the scale and speed might not work either for BCH. If you get a 1gb block how would  someone even validate the blockchain. Which might go to the exascale...  
I am trying to not be baised though and want to look the argument from both angles.
@_date: 2018-12-06 13:50:41
I plan to setup a node too. Would like to support the network and learn more about it. I think it's really cool we can play with the live network so cheaply. I could move 1000s of TX for а few cents. I don't know why but this really ticks with me and make me wanna code around this tech.
In regards to stats, probably if some of the big nodes start sharing some of their numbers we can infer some guesstimates. 
I think it would be really cool if websites like Reddit, Quora or Stack Overflow allow users to tip other users on the LN too ... 
@_date: 2018-12-11 08:35:43
When you leave a tip a bot will generate this invoice automatically. You need to pay through your LNBTC wallet. Then the amount is send to a repository and the user can withdraw when they decide to. At least this is my understanding how it works, found about it just 1-2 days ago.
@_date: 2018-12-11 09:38:43
Yes, I think this is how it works. Pretty neat. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 07:05:21
You can leave micro tips and pay on Lighting Network. Good example of an application which is not possible on the old system.
