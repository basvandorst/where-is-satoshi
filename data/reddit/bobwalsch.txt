No it's not stupid. It's a valid concern. There is no stupid question. There are a lot of angry teens on Reddit. Ignore them.
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:40:43
I understand your feeling.
It's easy I guess to feel angry once you know what happened. Never forget that it could have crashed big time also. One news, one discovery, one hack, financial crisis, etc.
Please stay humble, nobody knows the future.

Of course not.

Is it as easy as Coinbase?
@_date: 2018-01-24 22:59:08
Let's say less usable. Still compared to Bitcoin it was a walk in the park!

People often compare Bitcoin to digital gold and thus some numbers floating around are related to the (real) [gold market]( 
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:58:08
I'm surprised to read that. What funding option works with Tangerine?
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:35:10
I agree with you. I was very very skeptical about LN until someone posted a comment that made sense...
The thing is, people won't have to open a channel directly to use LN. For example a big wallet provider like Mycelium could open a channel and then all users could use this channel. So only big "hubs" could open a channel and it could last for years to come and allow millions of users to use LN.
Yes it creates more centralization but personally I think with times we will see thousands and thousands of "hubs" and it will still be decentralized enough. I hope so!
That was my understanding. After reading that I was more confident about the future of LN and Bitcoin.
But still, I won't hold my breath. I have new favorites coins... ;)
EDIT: Mycelium was a bad example. This solution works for web wallets on exchanges like Coinbase... who also has an app for cell phones.

I learned something today! Thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:54:51
Yes I have reached that stage a few months ago but not just about the dips, about Bitcoin in general. There are so much better coins around.
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:18:16
It's not the first upgrade as I recall. Hopefully this one will make them at least usable.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:49:16
That's a huge downside of "everything decentralized". 
Same thing could happen with a decentralized Facebook or Twitter. Without a way to censor content the troublemakers will rule the place!
Personally I prefer a bit of centralization and censorship over disgusting content and other offending stuff being permanently accessible to the disturbed.
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:04:41

Kraken has not been reliable for a long time (months!). A lot of people stopped using it I guess. I know I did.
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:05:44
I am wondering why people make such a big deal out of this? It's not like the exchange fees are high... (0.1-0.2%!)
It was on every subreddit yesterday, I don't think any other news was more popular in last 6 months. I'm puzzled.
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:32:11
How come? Last time I checked Ethereum handled the most transactions per day of the whole cryptosphere...

People should never forget that were are not all aware of the inside jokes + the language barrier sometimes makes it harder to grasp the sarcasm.
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:54:38
I understand your feeling. I am pessimistic also about Bitcoin future and think LN will be too little too late. I have found out other coin as my favorite to fullfill Satoshi's vision...and it's not a Bitcoin whatever!
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:30:22
Yes but opening a channel requires a transaction on the main chain which is already clogged. If everyone tries to open a channel it will take forever. Also, who will want to open a channel if it costs 30,40 or $100? I know I won't!
Thus the solution of big centralized web wallets opening a channel for their users. 
&amp;nbsp; 
With time I guess it will unclog the mempool thus driving the fees down and more people will be able to directly open a channel. Just a guess.
&amp;nbsp; 
I don't necessarily like that but I can imagine it could work with time.
@_date: 2018-01-08 12:02:00
You're right, it does not make sense. Bad example I guess. The guy was talking more about exchanges like Coinbase who also has an app for cell phone. It makes a little more sense.

I also think people underestimate the lazyness of people. For people to switch to LN it must be better than Visa and better than Bitcoin. LN has all the downside of Bitcoin + the restriction of locked funds. Even with the best Wallet/GUI out there, I'm affraid it won't get enough adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:28:28
I agree with you, onchain scaling is not a solution. I think it takes both bigger blocks and LN. Please let's imagine LN is ready in 1 year. Fees are at 50$ (very conservative!). How the hell do you think it will get any adoption? If you are right then Satoshi was wrong... and since he is the founder maybe we should give him a little bit of credit. I think a more realistic solution would be to SUSTAIN the main chain the time LN is ready. Sustaining just by raising a little bit the block size. Just to control the fees and prevent the downfall. Fees must be low when LN is ready. But I agree with you raising to 2MB probably won't do much... but maybe just enough so fees are back to a few cents. I think waiting is more dangerous than the centralization threat.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:51:11
I think it's too complicated. If you want widespread adoption user should see only 3 buttons: "Fund Wallet", "Send payment" and "Receive Payment". That's it. I wish. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:42:25
I know it's a fracking complicated problem!
I think we have to make a choice. Is the raspberry that important?
I'm very worried that LN won't make much difference. It's so restrictive, it has all the downside of Bitcoin + the restriction of locked funds + it won't be as widespread. I think it will take many years to get any "traction". Personally I would go for 4x so we can sustain the low fees while LN is ready. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:10:52
Indeed a slippery slope but the users should always be first in my opinion. If we cannot use Bitcoin with low fees it does not matter if we can run a node using a toaster or whatever. Also if we manage to lower the fees anybody willing to run a node can save enough in a year to upgrade that "pie" to something better. 
Anyway, is it really that important to have zillions of nodes? 1000 nodes around the world may be more than enough. 
I think a major flaw of Bitcoin is that the nodes are not compensated. No wonder the recent raise of DASH and EOS... I understand perfectly!
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:18:28

I'm almost done caring about the Bitcoin scaling. I think POW is a ticking time bomb. I prefer POS.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:30:21
I'm affraid it will be too late. By the time LN is ready and (if!!!) enough people use it the fees will be sky high (which will delay even more the adoption!) and it won't do much to the main chain.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:17:44
You are right but with more adoption comes more nodes. With the actual state of Bitcoin, adoption will drop. Don't count on speculators to run nodes! The chain is around 150GB right now. A 2x increase is nothing. LN don't stand a chance if fees are too high, it will kill his adoption. Opening a channel when fees are at 50-100$??? LN could take YEARS to have enough adoption so it makes a SMALL difference on the main chain. I think we should act FAST! 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:37:18
Best would be to have both: Lightning and big blocks. Best of both world. Hopefully it will happen sooner than later.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:44:59
it's bigcorn
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:14:29
It's discouraging to read the comments. LN cannot have any traction if the fees are to high to simply open a damn channel... 
LN will take years to get enough adoption so it makes any difference on the main chain.
There must be a significant raise of the block size at some point.
It seems so obvious.
Anyway with the actual governance model, nothing much will happen. 
Everyday I lose a little bit more hope about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:13:23
I think pure libertarian minding is a luxury of rich people or younger people who did not live long enough to experiment or see sickness or poverty. When your child, a parent or a friend becomes sick, gets an accident or becomes poor, you cannot stay indifferent. It can change deeply the way you think about taxes and government.
Not to mention that people here far north don't have access to internet. The government needs to be involved. 
I'm both fascinated and excited about cryptos but I fear the downside of tax evasion and social inegality. The poor, the sick will be left alone even more. 
I don't know for you but I don't want to live in a world where the majority suffer. Suffering around us affects us, conciously or not.
I don't have any solution though. I think cryptos are just the next logical step and there is nothing we can do unfortunately.

@_date: 2017-12-14 23:03:23
I'M WITH YOU ON THIS!! I have posted a few of my concerns lately. I'm affraid LN will be too little too late. It will not make sense to open a channel for 99,999% of the community if/when the fees are at 100$! If we wait too much LN don't stand a chance to get adopted! We should not count on LN to save Bitcoin for now. Let's raise that limit! 
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:07:32
Then use the "/s" :)
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:03:13
I understand your feeling! I don't expect much from Bitcoin anymore. I accepted the fact that Bitcoin may be just a store of value. I'm looking for my next global currency to change the world...
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:25:32
No offense but work on yourself and learn to say no.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:17:06
I am very worried!
I helped my brother cash out some Bitcoin 2 days ago and I was shocked when the lowest fee my Trezor suggested was like 10$! Shocked and ambarassed! But it did confirm in 1h.
Also, the more I learn about Lightning the more I'm getting skeptical. I wish LN could save Bitcoin but I won't hold my breath on that. It may takes years before enough people use it (we can see that with Segwit, people are lazy!) so it makes a difference on the main chain. Not to mention that it may take a year+ before seeing LN in production (the downside of Open Source development in action! SLOW!). And by the time all is ready and enough people use it, it will be too late. The fees will probably be 100$+.
Yes we could raise the blocksize limit until it's ready but we all know now that it won't happen without a few years of civil war.
Like I said, the downside of Open Source development in action. When nobody is in command it may seems "cool" but it's far from efficient.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:21:11
Seeing the trend of the fees it would not be surprising in a couple months. Unfortunately.
@_date: 2018-09-17 02:03:52
Gold is one of the most useful metal on earth! Its usage goes far beyond store of value: electronic, dentistry, aerospace, glassmaking, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:07:13
I realised how critical this is 3 days ago when I helped my brother to cash out some of his bitcoins. The lowest fees the Trezor suggested was 10$! I was shocked and embarassed! I don't believe that 2or 4 or even 8MB is a threat for centralization. On the contrary, if it stays like that I may stop my node soon enough because I am about to give up about that "currency" named Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-13 21:43:22
I agree with you. As a programmer I think there is no elegant solution (yet) like you said. I have searched other coins and no one has a real scaling solution of Visa magnitude so far. 
LN seems over complicated for the average joe. Looking at Segwit adoption I don't see how LN could gain enough adoption fast enough to relief the main chain. Fees will probably keep raising and what will happen when fees are 100$ and you want to open a channel and put 50$ worth of BTC in it???? It does not make sense! I wish it would be elegant and simple and great. I'm disapointed and pessimistic now.
@_date: 2018-09-06 09:06:12

"Each participant incentive" is something very dynamic, not something you can calculate and take for granted.
Cryptos just reflect the human nature, you cannot ever think that everyone will think the same, have the same incentives. Some want to make money, some want to destroy Bitcoin, some want to replace FIAT, etc. 
You never know what will happen and could "force" the majority to see things differently. Anything that could threaten Bitcoin could trigger a massive mess/fork. If you look at history we have many examples of a group of people who "think" they "know better" than the other group and then it becomes much less obvious for everyone.
 
I'm just saying, let's be humble and remember that Bitcoin is always just a fork away to a complete change...

I though the same. I though Bitcoin was a replacement for everyday transactions/money. I was disapointed to say the least. But when you accept that it may be just a replacement for something like Gold you get used to it. And then you discover that some crypto can replace the fiat once and for all. Or you wait for Bitcoin to evolve.

Lol! Exactly my thought! 
@_date: 2018-06-27 11:36:11
If I understand you are talking about DDOSing a percentage of the nodes so you end up having 51% of the stake and controlling the consensus? It is estimated that there will be around 10% of all the ETH staked. Right now it represents a grand total of ~$4B. If you end up magically to knock out 50% of the network (almost impossible in my opinion since nodes will be all around using different provider with a lot having already DDOS protection) you'll still need ~$1B capital to succeed? 
Now I'm not sure if you will be able to find out the staking amount of each node. If so then you could target the richest nodes (probably the pools) but still it would be surprising if you end up having enough cash to do any damage. Also I suspect the richest nodes will have the best protection.
Maybe I'm missing something but I'm pretty sure Vitalik and the other devs already thought about this basic attack...
Edit: I could lose my stake by being DDOS for too long though, it's a concern.
@_date: 2017-08-31 00:11:56
I think I'll read the white paper. Thank you for your help!
@_date: 2018-06-27 10:33:24
Care to elaborate on the DDOS of POS? I'm under the impression this was addressed already and that it won't be possible...
@_date: 2018-06-27 10:26:07
What if I hack the node code to listen to multiple IPs on a single machine creating the illusion of many nodes but sharing the same files, CPU, RAM, etc. I could lower my cost a lot and make it easier to create and manage more instances. You can rent a /19 IP block (8192 IPs) by the month for around 3-4K...  But what can I do if I control 51% of the nodes? Adding invalid transactions to the mempool? Care to explain?

@_date: 2018-06-05 01:17:17
Low transactions per seconds, very long confirmation time, insane electricity consumption, governance model that makes it literaly stagnant and almost impossible to upgrade/evolve, Lightning Network is more trouble than switching to another (ALT) coin, limited supply makes people want to hold and not to spend.

Edit: Fees can grow insanely high.

@_date: 2018-06-27 15:10:04
I don't understand your logic. Also you seem to have something against the ETH devs (are you a miner?) which I find it unfair since they are trying their best to make a fair system IMO and they never did anything that made me suspicious about their intentions, on the contrary! Vitalik is taking the time to address all the FUD and the critics and if there is someone I (blindly yes) trust in this field it's Vitalik. He knows his sh*t like we say! But I respect your point of view and will take the time to read your link.
Edit: after reviewing the link you proposed I'll skip the (very long) reading. The texts about POS date from 2014 and 2015. This space change so fast it's probably already obsolete and irrelevant. But thanks and good luck with whatever coin you like anyway.

@_date: 2019-06-09 15:01:59
I think that you are missing the point. This is not a matter of understanding the mechanics or economics of Bitcoin. Most people who do NOT suport Bitcoin would agree that it works, that the mechanism for fees, mining, etc are brilliant. I do, BUT I dug deeper, I learned the inside out, I used it, I used other cryptos and can now see all the downsides and decided NOT to support it.
And by the way the supply may not be manipulated but a new crypto is always just a fork away! Don't be so naive and think that it will solve corruption, wars or anything! Humans are humans and they always find ways to be d*ck and to fight and it has been like that since the beginning of time.

I'm talking about the general libertarian minding where everything should be regulated by the market and companies without any government involved. In my opinion, these people never got sick or poor. They are lucky and they don't know it. They have the luxury to think like that. The problem is the companies don't care about sick and poor people. I personally take a drug that cost around 20K USD/year (and this is the price of your free market!) but thanks to our free healthcare system I pay a fraction of the price. Now that I got sick out of nowhere (I was super healthy, ran half marathons, was doing yoga, etc) I realise how arrogant I was with my semi-libertarian minding before. Thinking that poor and sick people were just "weak" and "looking for it". Like it's their fault.
The other problem with this minding is to think that there is a company everywhere to solve a problem! NOT TRUE! In some remote regions here there are many people still without high speed internet. There is not enough money to be made by ISP and governement need to be involved so these people can have internet access. Well it's just one example where companies don't give a frack about a minority of people.
And I'm not talking about the oligopol of the ISP in my region. They already block access to certain TV channels (same companies control ISP, TV, newspaper, etc) of competitors. You really think people will pay for 2 cable companies to get all the channels??? It's not realistic and companies don't give a damn! Just imagine now what they can do with your internet connection if you give them the green light! 
Free market...ok...but never before PEOPLE!
Just my humble opinion.

I would love if someone could do a summary of this new layer proposal. I don't feel like reading all the technicalities. ;)
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:41:02
Post like that should be sticky to remind us all of the importance of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. Also to remind us that this is not a game and real lives depend on it.
Thank you for sharing and I sincerely wish you the best.

Ouch! So true, these things break easily!
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:05:57
Well keeping coins on any exchange is not recommended. There has been many hacks by the past and many people lost all their coins. A famous disaster was the Mt. Gox hack. Let's say that it's inviting for hackers, a lot of coins at the same place. Not to mention the exchanges that can freeze your fund or "lose" your money or whatever they can invent if they have bad intentions. You don't have the private key when you keep your coins on exchange so you have only indirect control over your fund. You have been warned! ;)
@_date: 2019-02-15 03:46:15
This! lol!
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:25:48
Oh don't worry, no problem. I was "kind of" aware. I have seen these issues mentionned in very old posts so I assumed that they were very well known. But there was nobody really talking about a solution to that. I could just hope that somewhere in a basement some developers were working on it. And here it is! :)
I have faith in Bitcoin, from 0 to 7000$ in 9 years it's an exceptional accomplishment. The future is bright I'm sure! Let's keep up the positive vibe!
@_date: 2019-06-09 16:16:01

Wow! Great news!!!
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:46:45
You are right but I think we also agree that we won't be able to stay at 1MB forever. Even with a second layer for what I have read it is not enough. I think it would be better if we could have a plan to raise the size let's say 1MB every year until a maximum of X MB. This seems reasonable and It would allow BTC to: 
* Keep his dominance/momentum by having better fees and avoiding queue congestion
* It will give time to implement a perfectly working 2 second layer solution
* It will satisfy a huge portion of the community
* It will lessen the advantage of the competing coin

@_date: 2017-11-21 19:56:53
Ok I get it. Sorry I don't know what changed. I think net neutrality can affect Bitcoin more than you think. Someone posted about Bittorrent. It's a good example. A few years back here in Canada the Torrent protocol was throttled by the main ISP. I think there is a law now that disallow such throttling. Bitcoin (nodes) is also heavy on bandwidth usage and this is the kind of thing that ISP want to throttled/stop because it cost them a lot in bandwidth. If you open the door to that it will get messy.
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:58:18
Ignore him. Look at his posts history, another frustrated teen.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:06:47
I'm with you. It's a risk but I think it's better to "look" a little dumb for a moment than lose all the market. I also avoid using Bitcoin and prefer ETH now. I wish It would be different. :(
I think it's important that we share these ideas here and there. Not by shilling or trolling but just sharing our opinions like we just did. At some point more and more may share the same ideas and they will be implemented. Let's keep faith in Bitcoin! :)

Hello kvothe5688 and welcome! I understand this can be very confusing. I suggest to watch this video, it helped me understand the scaling problem deeper: 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:56:14
I agree with you. I also feel that people are getting to emotional/sensitive about BTC. Any negative opinion and you are being a troll or worse. This is counter productive.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:54:13
You move your coins from where? Coinbase?
If you just transfer your coin from an exchange (Coinbase) to your wallet or from a wallet to another wallet the price of Bitcoin does not matter. It matters only when you want to buy new bitcoins or sell your bitcoins. But you should really wait a couple days to transfer your coins. The Bitcoin network is currently overloaded and it will take too long and/or you will pay too high fees. I would wait 2 days at least. It does happen sometimes but this time is particular.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:12:11
Fair enough. I should have said that I am happy to see them "adressing" these limitations.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:44:19
Oh yes, you are probably right. But it will probably also happen with the second layer. I guess the nodes of the second layer will act as a "buffer" and it won't matter much if it takes long for them to confirm the transactions on the main chain. For the users it will be instant. I'm affraid it will bring other problems though. I guess they are working on this as we speak. There is no easy answer, that's the least we can say!
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:40:14
is involved in hacking Is it just me or it does not make sense?!
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:22:58
I agree with you. But what if we just raise the blocksize limit a little to accomodate the current demand and it would give more time to implement the 2nd layer solution correctly? I'm affraid BTC will lose momentum to other coins. Actually it is happening I think. Myself I don't use BTC anymore by fear of having to wait too long. 
*** Legit concern here, not trolling. Prefer BTC. (it s*cks that we have to be so careful of not being tagged a troll or banned)

@_date: 2019-12-26 20:03:49
It would be a good idea but who will control the groups members? If anyone can join a group then the spammers will join. They will join them all, it's all automated. If they are clever they will play the long game and try to stay under the radar for as long as possible. You could remove the spammers from group... but who will decide that? There will be collateral damages and people won't be happy about that either. Also the more you'll think about that the more you'll realize that you are just trying to re-invent the wheel, to re-create a centralized network with paid staff that filter out spam content.

@_date: 2019-12-26 18:28:51
Idealy it would work like that but unfortunately as adoption increase, spammers and scammers will come in mass too. "Organic voting" cannot compete against the spammers and their ability to create and control millions of bots. 
People don't realize how many zillion posts are deleted every minute on the popular social networks. It takes tremendous work to filter out the spam and ban the spammers. On the decentralized world you remove the ability to ban the spammers (by IP address for example) so it's easier for spammers and things will get (very) quickly out of control.
@_date: 2019-12-17 16:18:52

@_date: 2019-12-17 15:57:21
Think harder! You can still create Bitcoin debts way greater than the max supply. Same with any currency. You can still artificially inflate the supply by selling some kind of "derivation" of Bitcoin. You can also fork it and raise the max supply. With a billion dollar marketing campaign you could win a massive amount of supporters for the "real" Bitcoin v12.0
Bitcoin is just another tool that can get massively abused with different ways. Don't underestimate human ingenuity!

Well if they send funds to 1000 people than you now have 1000 suspects and it's hard to incriminate 1000 people if they received funds randomly. But they won't do that, it's too costly and would be obvious if they keep more money than the others.

I don't know how OTC markets work but I am pretty sure that if you buy a big amount of BTC you will want to check the source and if you offer OTC services you will also want to vouch every wallets first. It is too obvious that thieves would try it.

@_date: 2019-12-26 20:43:58
You're thinking too much.
@_date: 2019-12-17 21:27:15
You don't use your imagination enough. Bitcoin could become debt based if people want to. Like fiat used to be backed by gold... and then it wasn't anymore. Just like that. You think people care if fiat is backed by gold or not? They don't. Same with Bitcoin or IOU Bitcoin. Hey talking about IOU... reminds me of Lightning! lol!
@_date: 2019-04-25 23:42:20
@_date: 2019-04-25 22:01:44

Not as easy as it seems, see the other comments...
@_date: 2019-04-25 18:32:50
It's a good idea but it would only work if they send a similar amount to everyone and I doubt they would do that. It would be easy to spot the few wallets with the biggest deposits.
@_date: 2019-12-26 17:11:27
It's an interesting idea but you could write bots, auto opt-in and auto-upvote or downvote or random vote. At some point you can have enough bots to control the entire network. If you pay the voters you just add more incentive to game the network. If you don't pay them then you will have less "real" voters and easier for spammers to control the network. I doubt that there will be any good solution for that. Either way you will always have collateral damages/censorship, even if you have a network of real voters.
@_date: 2019-04-25 18:40:33
Maybe they could use Atomic Swap from BTC to ETH then use any ETH DEX to trade to different tokens? Is the output address visible when doing an Atomic Swap? I am not familiar with this.

There's always a limit of what the earth can produce. Greed has no limit though.
@_date: 2019-04-25 22:06:51
Interesting. But aren't the Lightning network supposed to be private anyway? So you just have to send fund to a Lightning wallet (in smaller parts as I think there is still a max cap to the Lightnint network?), split and transfer to many other LN wallets and withdraw BTC to the main chain from each LN wallets. After that your BTC are "clean". Am I missing something?
@_date: 2019-04-25 18:29:25
There is still a risk that the exchange monitor these stolen funds and/or get warned and block the transaction. Also the exchange still have the IP and some other info (user agent, logging time, other transactions, etc) in case the hackers have not been cautious enough. I would not risk it... unless they bribe the exchange in some way...
@_date: 2019-12-26 16:47:31
Won't work. Spammers will have millions of bots to vote for their own spammy posts. I know, I used to do that for a living! :D

For frack sake ptisn1 in which world do you live? Bitcoin is almost not used by anyone. People just buy Bitcoin for trading/speculation, this is not a secret. Some people yes may buy for the idea, the tech, etc. It's a minority. Check the mempool, the adoption, the usage, it's anemic. Wake up!
@_date: 2018-11-16 00:47:29
I agree I agree! But still, the point was that they could survive if Bitcoin disapears. They all can even if they are worthless.
@_date: 2018-11-15 20:32:48
point 4: You're expressing your opinon. The concept of "value" is different for everyone. Some people find value in Crypto Kitties! (not me!) Technically speaking all projects could survive without Bitcoin. It's the hard fact. In reality it could be a disaster though. Who knows.

On what assumption you say that???? For Christ sake! Have you seen the monster mess about the block size debate? Another fracking Bitcoin will be created soon! All cryptos can hard fork to support Quantum proof algo. BTC might be the "hardest" though giving the big community with so many divergent opinions. So I don't know what is the point of OP's post.

There may be a few exceptions when Visa or Master won't refund. Of course, like with anything. I had to reverse transactions many times with my cc and it was always easy (I'm not from USA!) I'm pretty sure though that you will NEVER get reimbursed if something happen to your Bitcoin. When you grow up and you start having serious money and/or when you have a family to feed, you can make sure that "safe" is the keyword you care about.

I agree, that would be a good step. But how do you enforce that? Watching the energy bills? Mining farms would just split into smaller farms to avoid the detection. Also don't forget that, like a "parasite" Bitcoin miners will drive the price of solar panels higher and higher like with the video cards. Until there is none for regular use.

It's your point of view and by calling the government "theft" I won't give you much credibility. There is always 2 sides, you chose to see the negative one. I choose to see the positive side of giving taxes like helping people with auto-immune disease to get the 35K drug so they have a minimum of well being and so they can contribute to society instead of being bed ridden.

Few years back my girlfriend kind of betrayed me. I forgave her... it was hard but I did it for me because I was tired of living with the anger. I went to her and told her that I was forgiving her. I was in peace after that and could finaly move on. ... Few years later I saw her and she told me that I was right about everything, etc, etc. She was feeling so bad about everything. I could felt that she was relieved to finally admit that. Because of her ego she lived with that burden for years! I felt bad for her.

Excactly my point! It takes a lot of resources! It seems very fair to compensate the full nodes. One day I think we will have to go that route. When/if the nodes count drop I guess. In the meantime I just setup my very first full node on one of my server. It's a test, let's see how it goes. ;)

@_date: 2017-10-05 14:34:08


I'm with you on that one!
Do you think it is possible to implement a new random POW algorithm every x months or weeks?  It would make any specialised mining gear rapidly obsolete and would give back to the people the power of mining. Well I guess we would see people using huge amount of GPU but at least anybody could buy some... Any flaw with this idea?
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:15:59
lol! I like the site! :)
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:54:10
Ok, maybe I'll change my mind with time after more experience with full nodes. We'll see.
Question for you...
You seem to say that it takes very few CPU? Is it normal that my new node takes a LOT of CPU right now? Is it because it is still syncing?
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:34:18
Ok the magical question was "Plain sauce?"  Weird! But I'll remember!
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:48:14
I would say before. You will benefit from the fork and get the same amount of Segwit2x coins. However I suspect that right after the fork a lot of people will transfer back their BTC into ALT coins thus driving the price a little bit down. But still I would invest before to avoid having to choose between the 2 coins.
The best would have been to invest last week before the 6000$ mark. The very best would have been to invest in 2009! ;)
@_date: 2017-10-07 01:22:18
Yes I think you are right. The more expensive it is to mine, the more it will be centralized and the more it could be exploited.
Maybe POS will be inevitable at some point... both for the planet and for the centralization threat. I wish it will succeed with ETH so it will prove it can work. What do you think?
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:25:38
In my opinion the full nodes should earn a split in commission with the miners. That would make a good incentive and the problem would be solved.
@_date: 2018-07-23 02:14:16
Yessssss! I did my part, I started a Facebook group for my friends and relatives to discuss cryptos and created some PDF explaining everything about cryptos from "What is Bitcoin" to "The risks and downsides of cryptos", "How to buy Bitcoin", "Cryptos and taxes", etc. All in french. Days of work... and I think like 4 people read them. lol! But one is now a crypto trader and the other is into mining. At least now my work is done and I don't have to repeat myself anymore, I just give people the PDF. The next bull run I expect more people will be interested again. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:31:31

@_date: 2017-10-01 18:35:02
I think this would be a good idea. Like a copyright or something. It would protect everyone from big mistakes... just thinking about my local newspaper publishing Bitcoin Cash prices instead of Bitcoin prices last week! I almost had an heart attack when they said that the prices dropped to 400$! This kind of mistakes can have important consequences and will happen again if we keep getting Bitcoin XYZ versions.
But I'm affraid that coinmarketcap won't be enough and the very nature of Bitcoin would prevent any copyrighting. :(
@_date: 2017-10-03 12:59:26

@_date: 2018-07-23 01:40:44
Indeed but it's far more work than just looking at a few words and you know that. When you have serious money you must have a real plan to secure your cryptos: multiple hardware wallets, procedures in place for relatives in case something happen to you, separate seeds location, one seed in a vault at a bank (ironic!). Not to mention the time you need to spend to understand the basic of cryptos. Try to educate one of your relative and you'll see how hard it can be for them.

If I short BCH/BTC they will owe me some B2X after the fork I guess? I think I will close my short just before the fork to avoid the mess.

A majority of people don't care and don't WANT to be their own bank! It comes with a lot of responsabilities and risks. Do you want to grow your own food? Make your own electricity? A small minority wants that. Centralization/delegation is everywhere and for good reasons. It's in human nature to delegate responsabilities to have less work to do and less worries. Banks are not going anywhere.

I never said I loved banks. Nothing is perfect, nothing is 100% evil, nothing is 100% good. If you cannot see that you must be pretty young. Also I passed the 2008 crisis just fine with my money in the bank. No one in my family, not even my grand father, lost his funds in the 80s or ever.
Thank you cryptos for all the people who have lost their funds forever withouth any recourse at all! The count my be pretty high right now and growing everyday. I'm sure you could explain that to your parents when they get hacked: "But dad the security of your funds was your responsability, it's freedom from banks!" Yeah right. 
This being said... I like cryptos, I have dreamed many times to be free from the bank cartel. I can understand that, I also want to have this choice, this kind of freedom. But I realised that for me, there is a much greater freedom: the freedom of worries and responsabilities. 
PS: I loved Stockholm, very nice city!
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:53:41
I think yes! The same dance will probably happen for november fork. People will take money from ALT to buy Bitcoins. Bitcoin price will surge. After the fork Bitcoin price will drop and ALT will come back.

My god! Please go outside and talk to real people! This is a major pain even for the most techies! I cannot even buy without the risk of losing my bank account right now in my country. I spent hours to secure my cryptos: buying and configuring 2 hardware wallets, educating my relatives in case something happens to me, writing some procedures for them, putting my seed in different locations, etc. I just went to a bank last week to get a safe to put my Trezor seed. The irony! 
Most people don't give a crap about your freedom of bankers. They want safety, insurance and no worries about their cash (and I can understand!). Yes, sh*t can happen and the banks won't be able to pay back, etc. What are the odds in a lifetime? Near 0. The odds of losing cryptos? HIGH! I read horror stories every weeks on Reddit.

I am with RBC Canada and frequently transfer thousands from my company to my personal account for $0.85 in fees. Also [Interac Transfers are free]( Your choice of bank and/or account and/or transfer function is just lacking basic skills.

You live in a bubble.

You are right about Tangering and Interac, my mistake. My RBC biz account is free though, no monthly fee. This was an old plan, no longer available. The transfers cost me 0,85$ with this account. 
Anyway, I understand your frustration, I don't like banks either but I am not delusional, the fees of Bitcoin often were WAY above 1.50$. There is nothing to brag about here.

I don't think you need plans to use free Interac Transfers.

Terrific argument!

Yes my corporate account was free and it was an old plan I think. But you should not need any plan to use Interac Transfer, do you? I use it with my Tangerine account and it's a charm.

The guy has contributed to the crypto space more than anybody and you dare to say he is a scammer. Just wow.
