I'm really rooting for Bitcoinica to succeed.  Margin trading in the volatile Bitcoin market is genius, and it's a hell of a lot of fun!
But as much fun as it is, I won't trust more than pocket change to this site, at least not yet.  Here's what I've seen in about 90 minutes goofing around with small amounts of USD and BTC over the weekend:
1. I withdrew 8 times more USD than I had in my account.
2. I withdrew 40 times more BTC than I had in my account.
3. Gains and losses on trades didn't affect my balance.
Naturally, I returned the funds sent to me by mistake, and at least the first two vulnerabilities seem to be fixed now.  But what about the determined and skilled attackers out there?
I hope Bitcoinica makes it big, and I'll keep filing bug reports.  I also hope the words of [HN commenter jellicle]( aren't prophetic for Bitcoinica:

What does it mean for a community when the vast majority of its economy consists of gambling, lotteries, scams and pyramid schemes?
Congratulations to BTC1920, I hope he does something productive with his winnings.
