Ugg, this is NOT GOOD, I have been able to tell people the reason that bitcoin isn't taking off yet is no one knows about it, if it gets press like this and it still doesn't look good what am I going to say now?

Anyone can just buy bitcoin if they want. It's for sale already, the ETF had the premise of wrapping it up in some package to gain legitimacy and having a guy working on it that got arrested for security fraud and running a ponzi scheme is pretty much the exact opposite of making it look like a safe and legitimate alternative to just buying bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 20:12:55
It turns out that running a payment system costs money and people got lied to that you could do it for free. In the end running a million transaction a day network through some crazy global distributed and replicated 1000x times thing is almost certainly going to cost more than just having some company handle it. There isn't free lunches and bitcoin just mistakenly looked like one when it was so small no one really minded shouldering other people's costs. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 18:40:19
Hmm yes, that sounds like a good idea, now let me invest into this ETF written by a guy who is in jail for security fraud and running a ponzi scheme.

You realize that even if a matrix image macro told you something it doesn't actually make it a fact, being worth 1 million dollars doesn't actually make something automatically the new one world currency.

Bitcoin isn't really borrowed into existence, someone just waved their hand and made up a totally arbitrary schedule to just wish it into existence based on nothing particular.  There didn't really need to be a special technology to do that. 
@_date: 2015-12-21 17:04:04
More than 50% is controlled by people NOT running pools, you are out of date by a few years, a lot of chinese mining is now data warehouses mining on dedicated hardware and not pools of home users. Well more than 50% is run by less than 10 of these farms.

Pointing out bitcoin has been vulnerable all along for years is not exactly gonna calm this guy. But the truth is it wouldn't go to zero or subzero because this forum is full of people that already have invested and would deal with centralization rather than walking away from their investments.

Most people in the world include bitcoin in the scam category along with the altcoins though. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 14:30:13
The price was 1100 dollars for a while, now it's "going up" to being a third of that. It's been a really big failure and a lot of stuff is leaving the ecosystem. As for bitcoin visas, that is in fact another way to leave the bitcoin ecosystem for people that need to cash out back to real money.

Almost no stores except shadey gas stations have different prices for cash. Also using bitcoin YOU also are paying a hidden fee by way of the block subsidy covering much of the price of mining.

At one point satoshi's plan was bitcoin would be p2p and everyone would be a miner, a lot of the structure of the fees and things make the most sense if it wasn't users on one side and chinese servers on the other.

The blockchain is public, you can see we just hit 100 million transactions in seven years. We know for a fact that many websites and services do hundreds or thousands of transactions a day. It is unlikely there is even 1 million users. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 22:58:26
Oh, did it turn out that a currency needs actual human governors at a political level deciding what is real and you can't just go by code level majority? What a shock!
@_date: 2015-12-21 17:47:45
Still no where near "billions",  Maybe hundreds of millions total. Likely not even 1 billion of actual unique money and absolutely not multiple billions. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 12:44:15
Or it means satoshi economics was right and the whole bitcoin community is eventually huddling around 1 remaining bitcoin trading pieces of it for pennies. 
Or it means the market has collapsed so far into irrelevance that someone buying a satoshi for a dollar is left unchallenged and the "market cap" is in trillions in a totally dead economy with no buyers or sellers. 
@_date: 2015-12-21 17:30:05
Where does it have "billions invested"? the market cap is just number of coins multiplied by current spot price, not the amount actually invested. It also has less than a million users after 7 years.

Sure, this sub is shrinking because it sucks, but it is pretty clear that people aren't going to other subreddits. Other unrelated subreddits like bitcoinmarkets are also shrinking and the 'alternative" subs aren't growing even 10%  as much as is shrinking. 
Interest in bitcoin itself is shrinking. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 02:24:35
Can you just admit you have no idea what the word "fee" means. Bitcoin does not have a lower "fee" than credit cards or paypal.

Bitcoin was 324 dollars one year ago today, since then it's been both 500 dollars and 174 dollars, it's weird to describe that as a year bitcoin "soared".

In the bitcoin world you should probably assume all bitcoin companies are doing illegal things. 
@_date: 2015-12-21 22:21:14
In all of it's history the blockchain has had less than 100 million transactions, the fact we know single individuals have done thousands of transactions there is not a lot of space left for more than a few hundred thousand users at best. 
@_date: 2015-12-21 20:44:38
Fees will never get especially high because so few bitcoin transactions are vital that if they get over a few cents most will simply wait and use some other money transfer system or just not use bitcoin. (which is a huge problem when the subsidy falls away)
@_date: 2015-12-22 19:50:55
Okay, so your solution is just that everyone will do everything for free and you don't pay anything? I mean that sounds nice but not really plausible.

overstock used to release numbers, it came in 3 million dollars below what it expected to make in bitcoin sales last year. It only had 11,100  sales the entire year. It has not released numbers since, which is not a thing companies do to hide super good news.
@_date: 2015-12-28 02:28:05
Or it would mean neither of those things. Again, just because an image macro told you a thing that doesn't mean it's actually true. EVEN if the image macro has neo from the matrix on it and you took a red pill so you know it's 4real. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 03:29:56
It seems like all it's showing is decentralization doesn't really do much and only one single ultra specific element of the bitcoin economy is "decentralized" and that is so far fairly meaningless since only that one part is protected and that one part is not a part that had many serious issues for most currencies anyway.

The lawyer that worked on it got arrested for working on a ponzi scheme. It's maybe not the best idea to come out with another thing he worked on right now. Especially with the huge connection people in the public put between bitcoin and a ponzi.

That literally isn't true. The number of internet users nearly tripled from 1998 to 2000. You are flat out wrong.

You see bitcoin has a thing called the network effect which means that a thing with less users than the nintendo virtual boy will last forever for some reason. 
@_date: 2015-12-21 16:57:38
Bitcoin isn't exactly moving fast. it's still at or under 1 million users in it's 7th year. You can say "but but but it's gonna rocket ship one of these days" and even if that is true it's not like it has not given ages and ages of time. 
World war II was started and ended in less time than bitcoin has existed. Bitcoin is a slow moving invention even if you believe that later on it will find more users. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 13:53:33
Maybe all the businesses no longer accepting bitcoin and all the companies going bankrupt and all the big organizations leaving bitcoin to work on other things are a sign that the people telling you bitcoin is expanding exponentially and any second from going to the moon have been lying to you!

People run nodes because they have been running nodes, if we hard fork it will make people evaluate that choice and fear is far less than the already small 5000 will decide to put the effort into it. Bitcoin is running on inertia.

The thing is only around 750,000 use bitcoin. If those people were burned forever and would never use another cryptocurrency that is a microscopic drop in the bucket no one would miss their loss if some other one got 50 million users or something and the original bitcoiners sat out. 
@_date: 2015-12-21 20:25:35

It doesn't matter the raw amount of resources someone has, it matters how much benefit they see from a particular use. 
I have a job that gives me enough money to buy a taco bell taco, even if the price of tacos was raised to 100 dollars a taco. But I wouldn't actually buy a taco that costs that much even though I have the raw resources that I COULD.

Businesses will use centralized hubs because lightning networks give you bitcoins and no business currently wants bitcoins. Bitpay and coinbase will continue selling coins and giving newegg real money, so all real commerce will go through bitpay or coinbase's lightning networks.

The price of bitcoin was falling for a while and certain people blamed altcoins, so someone hand waved a vital new technology that would fix everything by forcing altcoins to pay with bitcoin. This has not and will not ever come out but it calmed the fears.
Now the fear is the block limit so the hand waving not now and not ever to be released magic technology is lightning networks. It will fix everything because no one is quite sure how it will work because it doesn't actually exist!
@_date: 2015-12-26 16:42:52
Cool, one guy owns 2% of all the nodes now and can use them to implement more surveillance on bitcoin users. Let's celebrate!
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:56:13
There has been 100 million transactions on the blockchain in all of history, we know that many people do hundreds or even thousands of transactions and some websites will do hundreds of transactions PER DAY, so it seems fairly impossible that there is even 1 million users. Maybe a little less. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 13:40:34
It's the same reason bitcoin users run nodes really. They get zero dollars and zero bitcoins in exchange for their 40gb of disk space and terabytes of bandwidth but they do it willingly because it supports a network they need.  
@_date: 2016-01-01 02:17:23
The plan was for bitcoin to be a P2P network, so there WAS a reward for running a node, it was called mining. But now that bitcoin is server and client model with a few chinese mining pools a lot of the intended mechanics of bitcoin are really broken.

@_date: 2016-01-01 11:40:20
You are right that the plan was for miners to run nodes, but bitcoin at one point was supposed to be a p2p technology. 
@_date: 2016-01-01 01:43:47
I think the clear future of bitcoin is that only a very small number of pools will control it and that will cause a LOT of fussing for a while but ultimately not do much since centrally controlled financial systems are a pretty normal thing that seems to work just fine and not really the devil bitcoiners pretend they are so bitcoin probably won't instantly end the second it's just a niche payment system controlled by 2 chinese guys. 
@_date: 2016-01-01 17:02:46
It is incorrect to say items on a blockchain are "immutable". Even outside of attack the community can change blocks at will. Altcoins using the same code as bitcoin have recovered from major thefts by reversing transactions, bitcoin itself reversed 50 blocks worth of transactions after an unfortunate bug that created 182 billion bitcoin in an overflow error. 
Nothing about blockchains are immutable and in real life things have been changed several times by human hands. (generally for reasonable reason, but it still shows it's possible)
@_date: 2016-01-01 01:11:37
Nah, most people, remember when firefox and even changetip released little studies showing most people have negative opinions about bitcoin and would rather not be associated with it?
