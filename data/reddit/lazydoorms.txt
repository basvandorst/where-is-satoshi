I own ETH and BTC. ETH is getting pretty congested too. I had a 1$ transaction fee. That's smaller than BTC, but ETH is also more than ten times cheaper than BTC. If BTC would be 1000$, people would not have so many problems with the transaction fees.

They have a mobile app and the registration process was quick. I chose it because you can use your credit card to fund your account and do not need to wait a few days for a bank transfer. Then you can send it to your wallet for free(no tx fee, no withdraw fee).
I also used localbitcoins and was okay. 
I used CEX.io, but they have 7% withdraw fee and sell at very high price. Do not recommend.

I had a 150sats/byte transaction confirmed in 12hours and a 200sats/byte in 2 hours. Both were done yesterday. Maybe I was lucky, but you can put a transaction with a replacable fee of 140sats/byte and change it later if it does not confirm.

It may disrupt the central banks and their printing presses. Private banks may stay around because many people don't want to be their own bank. They do not understand technology very well, so they will rely on third parties. But also, traditional banks may disappear and new online banks may take their place (Revolut, Coinbase).

You do not need to know how to code, but you should know some tech stuff.
If you are interested in learning I recommend the rasberry pi. If not, buy the casa.
