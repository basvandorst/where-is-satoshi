I did the same, spent 1 $10 BTC then the nzb search engine got shut down within a month.

I think that was the same one I used. Then it went out of business right when I bought a 1 year sub for 1 btc

I also paid a bitcoin for nzbmatrix. I sold a friend a bitcoin so he could get an account, too. I charged him $15.

Credit doesn't make you stand there like an idiot for half an hour while you wait for confirmations.

Your thesis is that past returns are good indicators of future price as long as you manipulate past data to look consistent?

Look at your screenshot. Those 22 days are not consecutive. 22 days and counting can only mean the last 22 days consecutively or it is blatantly misleading. You may be correct that the price at midnight has been over 1000 for 22 consecutive days, but you need to change your screenshot to reflect that. Some of the days are from 2013.

Wish I would have held onto some of these I sold back in 2013.

Yeah selling at $20 seemed great when they'd just recently gone up to $11-$14. They were very annoying to buy, though. We had to go into the pharmacy and call a weird western union type company to send money to some shady company and hope the bitcoins would show up eventually in our wallets. I didn't think they were going anywhere when I sold for $20.

What does paying someone to build a website have to so with shilling? I guess every employee at every company is a shill?

There are only 2 people in the SEC who head up this decision. I wonder if their offices/houses are bugged.

Good point. I actually sold off 1/3 of mine yesterday. I'll pick some back up if it drops.

I got banned from coinbase without any explanation. Maybe because I was buying too much and my bank was asking too many questions?

Can I be your MySpace friend?

About 3.5 BTC worth of mosquito nets directly saves one life. Just do some research before donating. Everyone on this forum has the capacity to avoid the obvious scams.

Coinbase closed my account without reason and will not tell me a reason. They did allow me to transfer out my bitcoins, though.

Great post, everything works perfectly.

Nice, I was wondering which would happen first - dow 20k or BTC $800. I last bought at the dip at $588 on Aug 17. Rarely do I time anything that well.

This is one of the many financial black swan events where BTC and/or other cryptocurrencies become valuable. There are plenty more black swans, too, such as hyperinflation of any major currency, bitcoin overtaking gold as a store of value, a stock market crash, a larger world war than any in history, even just a large bubble forming from human greed, etc.
In the book "Fooled by Randomness", one of the author's strategies is to bet on these black swan events. Sure, none of them are likely, but if you make a small enough bet on these events enough times, you eventually make a single larger return than all of the small losses combined. It's a positive expected value bet that you expect to LOSE. But they can be very a powerful tool in an investment portfolio by boosting the overall reward more than the overall risk. 
Cryptocurrencies tame their own obscenely high risk within a balanced portfolio both by being a non-correlating asset, and by serving as a hedge against certain black swan events.

Nah it'll just be an app they use, not caring how it works,  like other technology.

It would make headlines, I'd be up for it.
