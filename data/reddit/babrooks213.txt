ETF stands for Exchange Traded Fund. The simplest explanation I can give you is that it's essentially a stock that owns other stocks.
For example, if you're really into internet companies and you want to invest in them, instead of individually buying shares of Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), etc... stocks, you can buy shares of Vanguard Information Technology (VGT).
VGT owns shares of those stocks and a bunch more. It's a much cheaper and more efficient way of owning a whole collection of stocks at once. The best analogy I can think of is that it's like buying a deck of cards, instead of buying each individual card at a time.
They're pretty similar to mutual funds, but ETFs can be traded like a stock (meaning you can buy/sell them at any time during trading hours - mutual funds can only be bought/sold at the end of the day). They're a relatively new invention, only really been around for 20 years or so, but they've become hugely popular in the last 5 years or so.
Hope this helps!
