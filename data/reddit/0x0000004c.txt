Lol no you need to stop spouting bullshit. The housing market was leveraged and shorted bigtime that is exactly why it crashed and burned. What you claim is simply bs.

That's simply not true. The housing market was leveraged bigtime through derivatives. Thats exactly what caused it to blow up and why it crashed so hard in the first place...

Gold is expensive because it is expensive to mine it and because of demand. It has many useful purposes and is also used in a wide variety of industrial purposes, gold is very useful even your computer or phone you made that post on contains gold.

Lol you claim the housing market was not leveraged which is total bs since it was leveraged to the gills which caused it to crash hard in the first place.

Yes gold absolutely supports its current value.
It costs about 600 to 1200 dollar an ounce on average just to get it out of the ground.
Gold is not that expensive compared to what it costs to dig it up and its wide variety of industrial uses, and in jewelry and as investment and our reliance on it in general.
It has been recognized as a store of value for thousands of years.

Just like gold futures aren't attached to the physical gold you mean?..
I believe there are actually 10 to a 100 times more gold ounce futures in existence then all the physical gold ounces ever mined.
We've all seen how that went.
With cme futures price manipulation becomes much easier.
The same thing happened to gold.
You can artifically circumvent the 21 million cap that way by offering much more futures then there are bitcoins in existence, because investors dont need to own any bitcoin to sell massive ammounts of bitcoin futures to short the price.
Notice the empathy on futures being offered to short bitcoin.

I felt like the cme futures was negative news also.
I think the problem with the cme futures is that it will leverage btc to the gills just like we've seen happening many times before with other assets like gold for example. It will circumvent the cap of 21 million btc also because they will sell every same bitcoin 10 times over in futures contracts to different investors and can artificially inflate btc that way.

Yes as long as the world is on a fiat debt binge btc will rise.
Untill they do a complete financial system overhaul which is unlikely, btc reaps the benefits.

No Bitcoin isn't build on careless risks.
