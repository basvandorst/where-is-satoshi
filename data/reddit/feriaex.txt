I understand your interpretation, that's why we have changed to use the term "exchange service". 
(Your feedback was taken on board).
Yes we will be.

A few actually; HSBC, lloyds and Natwest, Although we are still in the application process for HSBC and Natwest. Our turnover is currently high so it needs to go through commercial banking rather than business banking.

I can't speak on behalf of the banks and how they make their decisions, but as I have said before, we are not limiting our service to bitcoin.

It is! Thank you for your response!

P.S. our security team will not just be monitoring logins, but other aspects of security too.

You'll be able to sell to us, not via.

They do yes, especially with the volume that is exchanged weekly and that is likely to increase with the launch of this service. Yes we are as of July 14th 2014 &gt;&gt; FERIAEX LIMITED Company Number: 09128592.
Also we are not just limiting our market to bitcoin. All virtual commodities/currencies as well as digital commodities/currencies.

We made our initial applications over the phone. Due to the type of account we are opening we had to go in to speak to a commercial manager for lloyds and will do the same with the other two banks in due course (HSBC and Natwest). The word bitcoin was mentioned, but the focus (as is with our service) was on virtual/digital commodities and currencies as a whole.

I understand your query there, but we are working to have all of the features mentioned above in full effect when the project is up and running. No compromise. Our IT guy is considering different ways of tracking IPs, when we choose the most effective and secure one, I'll personally PM you with exact details of the method chosen.
Thank you for your response!

It's unfortunate that you have that perception, all I can do is assure you that every update about our site posted, is entirely truthful and honest. Our security team will also be actively monitoring withdrawals from our site as well as reviewing verification submitted by account holders. With regards to the IP address problem, the best I personally can do is put your query to our IT guy and PM you with the response.

No as our service differs from regular exchanges. To buy and crypto currency, you'd simply open an order and one of our personal traders will get in touch with you within 30 minutes (30 minutes is a maximum range, should be instant). After discussing security/trade details/payment with you, an escrow would be funded. You would then make the payment to our trading account to fulfil your order. Payment confirmed &gt;&gt; coins released to your account or sent to a personal wallet address. This way, you can be sure you have full control over your funds (fiat and crypto).

Interesting. What we want to do is ensure newcomers know what they and we are doing and know what to expect. We will have a guide instructing what to expect when trading with us. We also are thinking of having a member of our support team contact each new account opener before they open an order with us just to ensure they are up to speed with everything. I think you make a good point about speed  there, but keep note that every aspect of our site will be manually executed. For non account holders/newcomers who trade with us the trader will have to confirm the guest fully understands our process. For repeat customers, this would not apply. Finally, we don't expect a full blown dialogue to be entered into just something like this:
Trader: Hello, thank you for opening an order with FeriaEX. Can you confirm that you understand the process of this trade in terms of payment and delivery?
Customer: Yes
Trader: Ok the escrow is funded, mark the payment complete when the the payment has been sent.
Less than 15 seconds of dialogue.

The sources of our volume will be identified as I said before, but not personally e.g. name, address, if consent is not given.
