Why do you guys argue with terrible comparisons and analogies?

Stuff like this is why bitcoin will fail.

The name of the post is "BTC talking point help request."
You are literally asking someone to arm you with a talking point. You are not interested in debate or discussion just about winning. You are what's wrong with this world.

Reddit is a microcosm of the real world. Your average Joe will have no idea what bitcoins are.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:41:56


No it's not. It's surrounded by corruption but most damning is that the value of a coin is not consistent and fluctuates like crazy daily. Anyone who makes or accepts major purchases with a currency like this at the moment is a fool.

Why would you keep 202 BTC in there?

No one will tip you in bitcoins. Just set up a coin tray.

Ok ponzi schemes are successful because people are making money.
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:57:32
I agree don't tell him because when you lose your coins for a second time it will just be more I told you so coming your way.

Sometimes you need to eat that humble pie and understand that your dad was right. It sucks but that's life.

I'm in law school now in NY. You guys need clerks or anything?
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:45:38
How about no wildly fluctuating prices and no corrupt exchanges for one? Oh wait that would involve regulation which is why no one will ever trust it.

No one believes you. You are just buying more time to move out more money.

Corruption and no consistent value yea that's a failure. Do you consider the Madoff ponzi scheme to be a success because it was "profitable" at one point?

Well I imagine he doesn't want his own son to lose money and that part sucks but I guess you learned a lesson about internet ponzi schemes so it's a net gain in the end.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:07:59


It's a horrendous analogy. Stop arguing in analogies and argue in facts. I know this is hard for you guys to do but try.
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:46:13
It will always carry a negative stigma when bitcoin fails.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:04:39
I can use your same logic to call ponzi schemes successful. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:47:55
Don't you think it's more of a problem that you can't answer someones argument without resorting to a hive mind to feed you with talking points? So all you care about is "winning" and not learning huh?
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:16:20
What?
