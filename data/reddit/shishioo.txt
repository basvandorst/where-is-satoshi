Yeah, you see how little I know lol. I meant the original Bitcoin coin.....

I'm guessing now is a good time to sell Bitcoin cash (that is if you didn't do it in the beginning). What do you guys think? 
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:31:55
Yeah same here, it all just feel like a gamble, could go either way....
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:11:52
Interesting, thanks for your view point on the whole issue.

I still don't know if it's smart to hold my BCC or sell them now and go all in on Bitcoin core. What do you other people think?

Finally timed the bottom, unfortunately I didn't spend more than 1k USD, but still nice to see this retrace!

Switzerland is the only country in EU going the right direction. If it wasn't so "boring" living there I'd easily move there. The rest of the EU has high taxes, high regulations, lots of crime. But Switzerland is the opposite, and now they're also open to the future of crypto currencies. Big applaud for them.

Finally can get some more cheap coins, have been waiting for ages it seems like.

What do you mean? They can just wire the money to me even if it take a few days? The moment I get the money I send them the Bitcoins.

Noob here....what is stopping anyone buying Bitcoins from Bitstamp and selling on these exchanges? I know it takes a few days to wire the money but there is a high chance that the bitcoins won't have went down in value in that short time.

So the safest bet then is holding long term? This is also what I'm leaning for. And man &gt;Following price since sub 5$
I'm jelly haha!

Yeah it's easy to think like this, and gets depressing fast. In 2010 I read a lot about Bitcoin but in the end....I thought "nah, just a pyramid scheme". Oh my god, I joined Bitcoin just 1 month ago. :/
Oh well, that's life.
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:38:53
Yeah that's true, I just wish I had sold some bitcoins last week when it peaked and bought back when price dipped, but doing that is also risky, you never know where the peaks are. But like you said, holding long term is the safest bet and that's what I'm gonna do.
@_date: 2017-05-23 15:24:50
Yeah, but as long as the price remains the same or go up you can make mad profits.....I might actually start doing this, buying on Bitstamp and selling in Korea/Japan, any downsides except it takes time? Seems like printing money right now.
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:34:25
But _what_ if it dip soon? :/ What is going different this time from last time?
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:23:31
You guys think it will dip like last week? Thinking if I should sell now or wait....ahh, fuck greed.
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:02:28
True true.
@_date: 2017-06-06 14:02:08
I see, missed the boat on ETH going up like crazy not long ago though. :P I hope it will dip so I can buy in.

What alt coins do you recommend? :)
