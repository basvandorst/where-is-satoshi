Haha yes, could go up another $3000 or back down $2000! It truly is a beast of its own.

I think it's totally possible we can see cryptos being heavily taxed in orders to be regulated by governments.

So is bitcoin...

If all this China FUD is their gov't trying to regulate and control exchanges, what does that mean for BTC/crypto. 
I think it's inevitable for gov'ts to step in and make regulations. On one hand, it gives BTC credibility and acknowledges it as a currency. On the other, we will start to fight its decentralized nature.
I think we are entering  a period with all new kinds of growing pains and it will be interesting to see how the world stage handles BTC.

And then came DVDs, and Blu-rays and now streaming. Tell me, do you still purchase VHS?

Is it really possible someone sent a couple thousand BTC to a wrong wallet address multiple times? 
Perhaps he was thinking it was a friends or something and when the person did not receive it he tried again?
Wow, I can’t even imagine!

I agree, I think some people are looking at it with rose tinted glasses. If several large countries don't allow businesses to legally use it, and they shut down/regulate large exchanges it would be a huge blow.
Obviously, you could still use bitcoin for things but you can't say that won't be a huge blow to the community and nothing would happen.
