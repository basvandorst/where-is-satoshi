In my book India is one of biggest democracies in the world- not an oppressive country!

I would say FB will become practically centralized  and not well regulated and not trusted “bank”. Even the name FB stands for FaceBank��

You are correct..

Instead of bull run we got bull s$&amp;t.. We are officially in free fall. God help us!

Just read an article in Quora stating:
The blockchain market is almost entirely controlled by whales. They own 40% of all Bitcoins, totalling $70B. They can increase the market cap of Bitcoin from $100B to $1T in a heartbeat if they wanted to. However, they wait for natural market cycles and then pump those.

I think Venezuela is already doing it. (They do not have other option actually..)

That make sense! But why others like BCH are taking this risk if it is real but not mainly theoretical? Is not it possible to evaluate and mathematically calculate what is the biggest block where the probability is still acceptably low for 51% attack and increase it to that size- still can improve probably the things..
Thank you!

There is one major feature which is important for being real cryptocurrency- Trust. While Bitcoin won the Trust of the masses for the last 10 years, the alts will have to walk long way to earn it.. The other features- speed, scalability etc. are technicalities which can be fixed (there are enough open source solutions and more are getting developed) when really required. TRUST you cannot “develop” even with the best developers!
@_date: 2019-05-18 16:36:32
I agree with you!  And as I remember reading that- the guy said that this could happen in like 20-30 years..

Bluewallet (you can install and set it up in less than 45sec) has inside a Marketplace, which is a Lapp Browser (you can of course use outside the app any browser) with many services like Bitrefill, ZigZag, TorGuard also games and among all is Sat2.io. I have no reason to doubt the legitimacy of any of these services offered including the Sat2.io Of course it is always good practice to do your research and read a bit for any of them which you intend to use.

But that’s only for USA.. Anyway most of the mining occurs out of US and many exchanges are situated also out of US, even the biggest Binance is a Chinese exchange if I do not make mistake. What stops any American to trade in the exchanges which are out of US like many other nations do it (India, Venezuela, Russia etc. ).

Agree but At lest the countries was ruled by “communist parties” and wet officially referred as “communist countries” like now a days many countries are ruled by “democratic” or “liberal” parties which has nothing to do with democracy or liberalism..

I really do not understand one thing and really need some help here if somebody can provide. Why Bitcoin developers do not increase the size of the blocks as BCH did it and it looks to work for them with cheap and quick transactions.. Why not use their experience- it is open source at the end. Is it just a “political” problem or where is the problem- why not use the best of every development and solution in the crypto-environment especially when most of it is open source?
@_date: 2019-05-18 19:00:00
But in that case what “communism” the author of this post refers to??
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:35:40
Hm, so the crypto currencies are also very “politicized/ideologysized” as any normal fiat currency yet the big idea was they to be the opposite.. Nothing new under the sun when money are involved..

I use Tweeter only on through the app in my iPhone. Does this Tippin lightning payments app works with iOS Tweeter App or only with Chrome..

Sorry! Posted it immediately after reading the Twitter. Obviously I have been late..
@_date: 2019-05-15 18:54:52
Thank you. But how it works for the other crypto which also use PoW and their transactions are much cheaper. Do not they face the same problem or did not they found probably a solution which can be used.

So your point about “Bitcoin is worst enemy of communism” is as relevant as “bitcoin is the worst enemy of slavery system” both are non existent dark memories from the past.. Communism collapsed in 80-es some 30 years ago. 99% of the world is a capitalist system and as we see all of their formal institutions - banks, governments etc. are not in favor of bitcoin or at least trying to put their hands on it by regulating rules.. By the way the biggest crypto exchanges and mining pools (crypto hardly can exist without them) are situated in not so unfriendly biggest socialist (or communist if you prefer)  country in the world- China. 
You would have done better to write about “bitcoin is the worst enemy of capitalism or any ..ism for that matter”.

If you are using the BlueWallet custodian Lightning wallet (normally containing small amounts for trading through Lightning i.e. off-chain) then you will be using their LndHub. And I am quite happy with that because it is seamless and very convenient and fast when I am buying coffee, airtime or sending/receiving small amts to/from friend etc.. That’s actually the purpose of Lightening according to my understanding- very fast and very convenient trading in small/daily pocket amounts (Bluewallet is encrypted with pass and they provide also Plausible Deniability).. More serious amounts we trade on-chain.  
But if you would like you can set up you own LN node and then you can enter it in the settings of the Bluewallet and have full control of your BTC  amounts in your LN wallet. The questions is- is it really worth it- and in my case (where I use it for small amounts) it is not. But that’s me..

Haha, my problem is that I thought month and a half ago when everybody was predicting we are heading towards bull run, that $6k is low enough, so I spent all I can.. Now it is $3k- is that low again or should wait another few months for $2 or 1K..

What is the difference between onchain and lightening bitcoin? Is not it the same Bitcoin which you can buy/sell/use on-chain or on lightening network(establishing channel with my vendors on lightening for example- quick and cheap payments). Also the atomic exchange..
@_date: 2019-05-05 13:59:36
It utilizes BlueWallet.  On Bluewallet, you can use custodial Lightning wallets or choose to run your own node. It is our choice.. I opted for custodial and it takes 45sec to set it up and start transacting.
