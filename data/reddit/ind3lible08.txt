Do you really believe Bitcoin can be THE crypto that takes off? I'm asking seriously, not being sarcastic. Ive only invested in BTC, LTC, and IOTA but it's hard to believe that when BTC still takes long sometimes and the fees are still significantly higher than the rest unless that's changed recently and I just havent sent money to notice.

To diversify and not put all my eggs in one basket like a lot of ppl recommended to me when I started but I have most of it in BTC. Still relatively new to Crypto so learning everyday. My investments were made when BTC was around 7k but I had been wanting to invest since 2013. Unfortunately, I wasn’t financially stable to do so then. My gf and I have been matching each other’s investments since and treating it like a savings, not investing more than we can lose but still... as the price drops, I won’t lie that I get worried it’ll dip below when we invested and stay there. We all believe the naysayers are full of shit but there’s always that voice in the back of my head saying “what if they’re right?” But I just tell myself I believed in the technology and its purpose for way too long to care.

[Willy Wonka &amp; The Chocolate Factory]( which is based on the book "Charlie &amp; The Chocolate Factory" By Roald Dahl. There is a sequel to the book called "Charlie &amp; The Great Glass Elevator" which is pretty bad and if they ever make it into a film, the well has officially run dry.

It bothers me that so many are rationalizing this rather than discussing a way to make it more anonymous. Dude, our personal information was leaked with equifax, fb, and now amazon wants to do this. The main reason BTC was so enticing is cause you’re removing the need for banks and you’re anonymous. We should be trying to protect ourselves more from this shady ass government, not allowing them to do stuff like this
