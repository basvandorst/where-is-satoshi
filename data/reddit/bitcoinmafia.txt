I didn't miss the cynicism. I just didn't pick up quite as much of it as you did. You make excellent points about safety from confiscation (or lack thereof) and taxation.

Yay - someone NOT trying to twist this into un-necessary drama. This is a good thing.

Until the crypto community concedes that at least *some* regulation is needed, this kind of thing is just going to keep happening because they know they can get away with it.

That's rich. BofA has been the subject of how many class action lawsuits over the past several years? I'm still getting settlement checks. Intentionally delaying deposits or rearranging transactions to force customers' accounts to be overdrawn so that they could collect fees, random holds on check deposits, etc...

That's healthcare in the good ol' US of A. I thought about setting up a GoFund me to see if I could get some help to defray costs while I recovered, but digital panhandling just kind of goes against the grain with me somehow.

That is so wonderful OP! I am still struggling to pay down the $100k+ in debt I now have thanks to a 2 1/2 week stay in the hospital this summer BUT on the upside, at least I am here.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:47:42
Me too but apparently it has something to do w/ the way the futures contracts are structured.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:41:38
I like your idea. It begs the question though of why *didn't* they? The last anybody knew, adding BCH was not in their immediate - or even their 'near future' plans - and then all of a sudden, BAM - Coinbase adds BCH.
  
Even if there was no insider trading, it's still sketchy as hell.

No popups or anything irritating like that. I got sick of waiting for the top of each hour for the 1.9 seconds of available time before the freebie queue filled up @ ViaBTC so I started one of my own.
@_date: 2014-04-11 04:22:34
I got started w/ CEX.io but you're right - it's no longer profitable. PBMining.com offers GHS at 0.0064 BTC / GHS. Contracts are roll-your-own and are good for five years instead of just one.  
  
I did a [writeup about my experiences with CEX.io and PBMining]( if anyone is interested.

Well crap. And here I was getting ready to get all rage-y and write a scathing blog post about the ignorant teacher. Sigh...

Sorry - wasn't trying to be insensitive. My poor attempt at trying to inject a little levity. If the MtGox fraudsters are somehow held accountable and it sets precedent for people to have legal recourse if they get screwed, I think *something* positive can come out of this debacle. You *know* that each and every one of the asshats @ the top over at MtGox have obscene hoards of BTC. They should have to reimburse their customers from that.

As Indigo Montoya would say (to the teacher), "You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means."
  
This teacher (and I use the term loosely) is a DIScredit to his/her entire profession and is wrong on two counts:
  
  1. Bitcoin isn't a Ponzi scheme. That is a determination based on fact, not opinion.
  
  2. The assignment asked for the *student's* opinion. It did not ask the students to regurgitate when they think is the *teacher's* opinion.
  
Good on ya for backing your son and taking this up with the principal. I hope you took your son out for some fun and bought the lad some of his first bitcoin for his efforts!
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:12:04
Most journalism today is a joke, slanted toward whatever agenda they have - in this case, a smear campaign against Bitcoin. Someone on Twitter said something that summed up the  MtGox impact on Bitcoin perfectly: MtGox=Service, Bitcoin=Protocol. If Gmail closed would email be dead? No because Gmail is a service &amp; email is a protocol.

Crazy stuff. Sad that people fall for it. I finished the article if you're interested: 
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:45:14
That's terrible. These exchanges handle millions of dollars in transactions a day with next to no accountability.
  
I sent my tweet out into the universe. Hope it helps!

CFTC chair isn't exactly mid-level. Do I think his comments alone manipulate the market? No. But I think it indicates a growing sentiment to at least acknowledge crypto and try to understand it rather than just dismiss it out of hand - and THAT has an impact on the market. Some of his comments are pretty telling.
@_date: 2018-02-12 01:55:54
I heard that Roger Ver stole them and turned them into a bola that he uses to destroy his enemies.

Why wait til AFTER the fork? If you buy and HODL, you get your Bitcoin PLUS whatever new variant emerges form the fork (BitcoinGold?). It's free money.
  
Plus I don't think it will drop as much as some folks think it will. Remember the hype and fearmongering surrounding the August 1 fork? The fact is that the ATH for Bitcoin in July was $2878 on July 31. Then came The Forkening and on August 2 the price dipped by less than $200 to roughly $2695 or so, only to pass the $3000 mark three days later and then the $4000 mark just 8 days after that.
  
^* Not investment advice. Just my opinion. Which are like arseholes. Everyone's got one.
@_date: 2017-10-08 14:23:48
True, but throwing down a pronouncement like that while not knowing what an ICO is speaks to an incomplete understanding of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:02:48

I've been involved in the crypto community off and on since about 2014 - but really mostly over the past year and a half or so. At first I just thought it was so exciting to be involved in something so revolutionary that was just beginning to find its feet. It still is exciting. I bore my husband to death with talk of blockchain projects and ICOs and what is the best way to scale Bitcoin, and what Vinny or Charlie or Roger said on Twitter and who in the world would ever believe that Craig Wright is Nakamoto anyway?
  
I finally got steady work (albeit part time) in the crypto sphere which makes me happy as a clam. Still not enough to pay for my hospital bills or even pay for my son's upcoming school trip to Japan (he's HF autistic, so it's really a huge deal) yet, but I keep working and earning my bitcoin and looking for MORE work to earn more bitcoin.
  
I still have a dream that one day I'll be tapped to be a part of a meaningful, useful, successful ICO but until then, I keep working.
 
Congratulations on reaching the $1M mark :)

From a PR standpoint it's no different than launching a negative SEO campaign against a competitor. Links on Reddit have shown to drive a significant amount of targeted traffic to websites. I could easily see a competitor - or even just someone with a beef against Coinbase - doing this to push them off the front page.

I'm divided on this. On one hand, YAY! more Bitcoin adoption. On the other, I remember PayPal screwing me out of several hundred dollars when someone bought Bitcoin from me and then once I sent it, turned around and filed a fraud claim. Even though I had emails and screenshots showing that the client knew what they were ordering and that it had been delivered, PayPal still refunded their money - so I lost my Bitcoin AND the money the scammers paid for it.

And how much hard currency is stolen every year? Between "traditional" bank robberies, cyber crime, ATM theft, identity theft, etc... the answer is MILLIONS of dollars. In 2013, thieves working together around the world managed to steal over $45 MILLION from ATMs worldwide in just a matter of hours.
  
Theft and scams aren't solely the province of digital currency, no matter how much some folks would like to think otherwise.
@_date: 2015-03-10 13:48:35
Well sure, if *logic* factored into the equation :) Nobody has ever accused PayPal of being *logical* about the way they run their business.
@_date: 2015-02-04 01:36:27
Yes I do and I don't get why so many non-believers get so aggressive and rude about it. I don't tell them that they're damned for not believing (which I DON'T think they are, by the way) so why be all insulting just because someone DOES happen to believe?

Is there a transaction ID # on the withdrawal from the casino? If so, look it up in blockexplorer.
@_date: 2015-02-22 17:28:43
It's a basic frigging *faucet* - what do you expect it to look like?
@_date: 2015-02-15 20:05:04
Right, because nobody ever stole or committed a crime using good ol' hard cash.
@_date: 2015-02-16 00:39:43
I wish :) Nope. I know its not a lot of BTC compared to what a lot of people lost, but it was a lot for me. Hoping to find an extra web dev or SEO gig to cover the loss though.
@_date: 2015-02-22 19:34:45
Glad you like :) Hoping to increase payments (and set up LTC and DOGE faucets too) as soon as I get some ad revenue coming in.
@_date: 2015-02-16 05:33:08
Agreed. But the flaw doesn't lie with the currency's technology, imo. Bitcoin (and the blockchain) are either as secure or insecure as we allow them to be. As long as exchanges use shoddy security practices and as long people do stupid things (e.g. not encoding wallets, not using cold wallets, etc...) stuff like this is bound to keep happening. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 04:56:38
I get paid in bitcoin, for starters. Most of it I convert to fiat and xfer to PayPal to pay bills. Some of it (very little) I invest in a few ICOs.
  
I am hoping to earn enough through the ICOs to pay for my youngest son's high school trip to Japan next summer. It's kind of a big deal because he is autistic and we were told through most of elementary and middle school not to be too surprised if he gets held back.
  
Not only has he never been held back but several of his teachers nominated him to be able to go on the trip. So we are very excited. The trip is expensive though, so I am doing everything I can to raise the money.
  
So not only does bitcoin pay my bills, but with luck it will also pay for my son's trip :)
@_date: 2015-02-15 21:21:19
Well crap. I only had 1.5 BTC on it, gaining interest, but I was counting on that to buy my son's college textbooks next semester. Ugh.
  
Back to looking for *more* work to cover the loss.
