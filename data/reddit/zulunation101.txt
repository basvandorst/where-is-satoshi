Surely that is a fantastic question to be airing on nation TV considering the answer. It may seem like a stupid question to us but the vast majority have little to no comprehension of what BTC actually is or where it comes from. It wouldn't be hard to assume that BTC is limitless if all you knew was the price and it being mined electronically. If we had the full video clip, I'm sure the response we would go on to get is that there is indeed a limited supply. This hopefully somewhat alliaviates the average Joe's concerns regarding it being uncapped.

It's me with the burden of proof yet we are here having this conversation in the Bitcoin sub... I have nothing to argue with you as you're clearly twisted out of shape towards anything that doesn't fit with your pre-conceived ideas of what should and should not work, as opposed to what actually will. Also Bitcoin is not the same thing as blockchain, an assumption which is a solid indicator towards how uninformed you are. 
In short, fuck off back under the rock you came from. No one here is interested in listening to your combative, substanceless tripe. The proof will be in the pudding. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 15:49:58

If we're talking as of today then I agree. I was more so looking toward the future. Talking about the practicalities of cryto as either a store of value or as currency is moot as neither crypto or indeed the masses is quite ready for either scenario today, IMO.

Did you get the right answer?
@_date: 2018-05-10 13:09:44
Somewhat of generalisation as well as untrue to say Swedes don't see the point in Bitcoin. They perhaps don't see the point in using it as a means of transaction today, but there is a reason Sweden is seen as a leading global innovation hub - because they are forward thinking. Also the suggestion that Swedes believe the government has the answers for everything is quite frankly ridiculous and I'd love to see you provide anything of substance to back up that audacious comment.

I think they are observing the integration of fintech into their daily lives become more prominement and practical than the legacy alternatives (banks). I also believe that given the 0% interest rates people are actively searching out higher yield investments, which I know full well has led many to cryptocurrencies. I am by no means saying the consensus is that Bitcoin is overtaking the current FS system but I am most certainly disagreeing with you when you say people see it as pointless. I would also direct you to the recent opinion poll on a Riksbank issued E-krona.

Don't immediately try and get your head around "cryptocurrencies". Instead, research blockchain technology. Once you understand blockchain, you will start to understand and see the almost limitless possibilities it provides. Cryptocurreny, tokens, altcoins or whatever else you want to call them are effectively companies that utilise blockchains and issue a coin with its own specific purpose. Rule 101 is if you can't see or understand how or where a coin derives it's value - leave it the hell alone! Educate yourself as much as possible before investing in anything. If you don't understand and you get burnt you only have yourself to blame. Good luck out there!

It did indeed start in lots of places and lots of times, the one that got real traction was called fractional-reserve banking. Ensuring wealth is liquid and controlled by mutually funded (by financial institutions) central banks, under the premise that they are for the people made by the people. This is a fundamental prerequisite to the manipulation of wealth and indeed assets. If my cash cow was jeapordised by something that impacted my ability to milk the fuck out of the masses I'd be a bit pissed as well!

There was no "tried" about it. They had one objective which was to totally deceive people into buying their shitcoin with a pure bait and switch. I never had a problem with the fork until that point, as ultimately the better chain would out the other. The tactics used were not done to gain support or foster interest in an alternative "solution" but instead to swindle.

No offence intended, but it will take more than a reddit post for them to reinstate BTC as a payment option.

Well written and some really good points in this, although I feel the amount of new BTC being pumped into the market daily is somewhat negligible considering an average daily trading volume of around $7 Billion. Let's say at worst $14 million of BTC is needing to find a new home daily due to miners dumping, there are still a huge number of new wallets being created which will be hoovering up a lot more than that $14 million. For example in the last quarter of 2017, on average there was 1 million new wallets being created per month.

No offence but I can see a couple of flaws in your statement. You traded 1.8 BTC with a view to making it 2 BTC. Yet you managed to get up to 3.5 BTC. This suggests you had no strategy and if you did you certainly didn't stick to it. That's your fault not the alt markets. Have a strategy and stick to it.
You researched every night, leaning more and more about alts. We're you looking/trading them purely for the quick trade or because you were genuinely interested in the product and felt it could go the distance? If it was the former then more fool you. Why would you ever trade something you don't actually believe in. This leads to panic selling when you see a dip. 
Lastly, you are allowed to own more than one coin. If you enjoyed the alt market research etc then have a core holding of say 1.5 BTC and the rest you can play with or Hodl in other alts. If you can't create and have the fortitude to stick to strategy then I would agree with you, just HODL BTC.

Give me your address...?

We should start a chain, each passes on the same amount to the next person and show LN in action.

I agree but it's important to look at all possibilities not just the ones you want/expect to happen. Assumption is as they say, the mother of all fuck ups.

Ridiculous! Mamma warned about the nutters on reddit... via messenger.

Considering fiat will hopefully at some point become worthless, surely it makes sense to be getting rid of it :)

This is like celebrating an advert for pay day loans.

What happens if everything you have said happens, but it's not Bitcoin that it happens to? 
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:30:43
Correct it would the the best and indeed most unlikely offer :)

The irony is the first image is before he had his shit pushed in.

The weirdest thing about this is that you were on a cruise ship without Wi-Fi! Does that mean you had to... talk to other people? 
@_date: 2019-05-22 12:22:12
Well that's exactly what I am saying.

Edit: ok let's add some actual fuel to your poor offer, if this poor mans outfit still exists by the date stated by OP, I will raffle a banksy print.
Edit: I promise not to follow through with this, unless BTC is worth more than 10k

He said bitcoin not blockchain.
@_date: 2019-05-29 11:43:03
I have to say, this is actually pretty cool.
@_date: 2019-05-18 03:12:17
Ah yes, a good old fashioned circle jerk
@_date: 2017-07-18 13:29:51
Gotta say the execution of this whole thing is phenomenal! Who knew you could actually herd cats.

Ah yes, a good old fashioned circle jerk

Which is why there is currently an arms race to be the custody solution of choice. I sometimes worry  that if Bitcoin is successful and becomes adopted on mass, will we eventually just replicate the same broken system we already have.

Maybe he is delusional. I would add though that he can and has gained financially through this bullshit. Pretending he is satoshi provides validation to his "projects", even if it is only believed by an ignorant few. Fools and their cash are easily parted.
Edit: Thinking on this further, particularly with regard to those that say "why does he continue this ridiculous charade, when he clearly is not who he professes to be". You could argue that he is now being very clever. After all, if it eventually is proven he is not satoshi, will it be better for him to be perceived as a liar or will it be better to be percieved as delusional? One makes him something to be despised whilst the other makes him something to be pitied.
Ultimately even if it is proven he is not Satoshi, there will still be idiots that believe him. Just like falt earthers and anti-vaxers.

Haha. Your originals are from unknown artists and are worth next to nothing.
