I can consume a road in unlimited fashion. I can drive in a big loop all day every day. Please tell me how profit motive has made my ISP give a high quality product at a lower price. The private sector has its role in the economy, but it really has no place in infrastructure.

Because I have a limited amount of data I can use. So maybe my path isn't limited, but my amount certainly is. Your point was to call government bad. Someone pointed out that that the government provides us with infrastructure, more specifically, roads. Your counterpoint was that t-shirts still exist even though slaves do not, I'm guessing trying to prove that the market fills in the gap. My point was that the private sector exists to create a profit. Then you didn't really have a coherent argument.

Maybe you're looking at everything in a shortsighted manner?

It's not a contradiction. You just have to use your mind a little bit. It would be like limiting the distance you could drive on a certain company's road per month. It doesn't directly limit my path, but indirectly, it does. And free market forces allowed major isps to become so large that no other companies could compete. And government intervention by the fcc will create more competition than the free market.    
    
And yes, private companies build roads, but they do not own them. There's a very big difference there.

I'd love to pay a toll to use every road in the US!

Considering I pay for Internet, yes. And the amount I pay is enough for a company to make a profit.

Sound like bullshit because I don't think that BFL was even listing that as their delivery date.
