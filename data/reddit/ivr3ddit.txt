The crash isn't over yet.....more pain incoming, double digits soon and it'll be awhile before the rise.  One more fuckup by yet another exchange will end any potential runup for awhile.

Yes, take time and several levels of identification to increase the limits.
At the moment, $25k/day thru bank or up to $250k via wire with Level 3 verification
@_date: 2019-10-05 23:39:18
Coinbase, Gemini, etc?

IIRC, only account holders can make deposits (cash included) into their own accounts. 
You might want to reconsider making this type of transaction.  Chances are you’ll be SOL if you do this. 
Meet face to face and trade in a safe environment would be best.
Post on reddit (r/yourcity) that you’re interested trading BTC I’m exchange for cash in person/face to face

That guy that paid and/or received 10,000 BTC for a pizza back in the day
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:02:45
You did it by the book IMO....test with small amount 1st.  
Yes, the small amount (less fees) will display in your wallet after 6 confirmations on the blockchain.
So long as you restored your device correctly.

Gotta give credit where credit is due:
TYVM Slush, although I was fortunate not having any BTC in gridlock
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:17:10
Yes here, my 1st BTC purchase was a few years ago when TREZOR was sold and only BTC was accepted at the time.  
But this time around, I will wait until Amazon has these for sale.....shipping cost is outrageous and hopefully BTC values are much higher by then.  Until then, TREZOR 1 and Nano S will do.  
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:26:05
I saw this coming........negatives effects with all these different forks/byproducts: Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, Bitcoin segwit2x.  
Way too confusing for the average Joe.
There SHOULD only be ONE Bitcoin!
Me?  I'm a trader by nature so I trading for profits like a motherfucker (buy low, sell high, rinse and repeat) on all ends...HODL on BTC?  This maybe applicable a few years ago, certainly not now. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:04:46
The fact BTC can be "attacked" in itself is disturbing

BTC is not fraud-proof you know
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:18:09
Chase has enforced this similar/same policy for some time now.   My guess....BTC has some part to play in this along with other money laundering reasons.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:47:46
Fuckin hilarious, where the mention of the word "Bitcoin" gets you banned
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:25:08
Hardware wallet will provide you the backup keys and you place that in a safe.
Paper wallet usually provide you both public and private keys together and you would place that in the safe (if there are any BTC transferred to it's public key)

that's just his opinion...
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:10:49
If you have BTC in an exchange and want to transfer it quickly....convert it to ETH or LTC 1st, quick tx time and much cheaper fees
But of course, that depends on what your trying to accomplish on receiving end.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:08:12
At this point, it would be best to bank wire the funds directly into GDAX and then placing a limit order on BTC.
Then transfer the BTC to a hardware wallet and HODL/enjoy the ride ����
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:55:40
You should be able to check your balance on your trezor now if blockchain indicates confirmation of the transfer.
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:13:50
give it another 48-52 hours to confirm
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:04:34
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:48:14
Was transfer of funds confirmed?
Did you check on the blockchain?

If I’m mistaken, I’ve read some other banks has closed accounts that had Bitcoin related transactions.

Let’s see...
1st purchase with BTC: TREZOR when they only accepted BTC at the time for payment back in the day
PC components....too many to count to generate even more BTC and other cryptos 
Weed (where it’s legal)
A few top shelve escorts that excepted BTC for services rendered 
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:18:36
If that’s the case, don’t convert BTC and submit the transfer but be aware, it may take a week to confirm or gets cancelled.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:08:23
what wallet are you using?
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:52:59

IMO, better purchase this lot through an exchange.
I suppose you wanted to remain somewhat anonymous hence why you are offering cash to complete the transaction. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:18:44
IMO, Hardware Wallets: TREZOR and/or Ledger Nano S
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:14:50
Not sure how much it'll cost to ship but I can check with local Post tomorrow...
That would be US$90 plus shipping in Bitcoin
Let me know if you are still interested
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:15:42
I can do that but I would only accept US$90 plus shipping in Bitcoin
Let me know if you are still interested

Be careful.....who knows, they may disappear on you before you even reach their withdrawal limits
You should try NiceHash instead

Yes, you can make purchases with several online retailers and pay with BTC.   Adult escorts accepted BTC as well ��
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:12:03
I have (2) BNIB factory tamper proof sealed TREZORs both in black if anyone interested in purchasing with BTC.  
I’ve have rep in both r/hardwareswap and r/giftcardexchange for references.  
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:51:31
I purchased a TREZOR a few years ago, setup the device and loaded a handful of BTC into it and been in bank safe until this past week.  Plugged it into PC and barely can read the display.  [Backlighting]( on it must be fucked.  Shit build if you ask me.  
Fortunately I was able to read the display with a magnifying glass and transferred all the BTC onto a paper wallet for now until I figure out what to get next.   Certainly not another TREZOR in its current version. 
I looked at the Ledger Nano S and very concerned about its build quality as well...probably a pass on that. 
May just have to wait for TREZOR v2.

TREZOR and/or LEDGER
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:46:10
I would move it into your hardware wallet asap where you control and hold the private key(s).
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:11:10
Great idea but I have no clue how to set it up....too scared/cautious to try after reading [this]( and I "NOPE" from the subject

I had order one thru amazon, came shrink wrapped but NO tamper-proof security seal I believe Ledger stated it should have.

Ledger Nano S?  If so, how you like it?
