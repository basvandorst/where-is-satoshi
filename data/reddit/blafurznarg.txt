I removed everything I found from my system. I think, I'm save now. Thank you!

I don't think there's anything left because I use a potent AV system.
I removed anything and I think I'm save now.
I don't use bitcoins. It was just s. th. I wanted to know about.

That was the first thing I did. Killing all related processes, removing the autostart entry and deleting the complete folder. Malwarebytes found nothing, but I expected that anyways because it is actually a legit applikation. I just did the mistake to run a setup (with admin rights) from which I thought it was s.th. else.
Yep, but it was a great reminder. From now on I will be more attent then ever!

Yeah... What I'm curios about is that my AV detected nothing...
But thanks for the info!

That actually makes sense and is indeed a brilliant idea as tuzki said! I just "bought" the new Bioshock. The installation failed and since then there were those strange notifications...
Malwarebytes is running at the moment.

Exactly, this ELI5 was part of my "research" to understand the whole Bitcoin thing.
I just wanted to know if this is technically possible to use my computer to mine via a remote application.
I just killed all processes, denied the internet connection, deleted all related files and deactivated the autostart.
I have no idea how this happened. I am very attentive with internet thing and I can't remember visiting any websites except Reddit, Wikipedia, a forum and blockchain to get information....
