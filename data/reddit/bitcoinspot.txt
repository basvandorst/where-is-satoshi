In this episode of bitpraat we are joined by Patrick Savalle from Mobbr. Mobbr is a platform for network payments. Mobbr facilitates the payment and collection of money earned with performing online labor. We talk about Mobbr and the how and why of funding the Bitcoin-devs trough mobbr. Last but not least patrick gives us a little tour of the Mobbr website and shows us how you can donate to a github project.

Why don't we start a lighthouse project to raise money so that we can buy the episode from CNN and put it on the web for free ?
