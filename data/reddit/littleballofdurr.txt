I was under the impression that if you need something done in Tokyo you don't use a sign, you use the Yakuza. AmIwrong?

Gox transactions aren't working. So if people have been buying/selling Gox in the hundos, it's hoping that they will eventually make everything right. Some are maintaining hope. It's not impossible, though it's quickly becoming more and more improbable. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:59:21
So much for sleeping. I don't even have money in Gox, but I gotta stay up in case coins plummet and I need to buybuybuy.
EDIT: Plummet further.

The point of cryptos is to have non centralized currency. While the Scotland may not be issuing Scotcoin, it certainly sounds misleading. People are confused enough by coins as it is, and how many know the difference between the Pound and the Pound Sterling? See my point?

The Bitcoin Bandit. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:45:53
Does anyone still have Goxcoin? And if so, why? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:17:54
Forget the post office, post his mugshot at Starbucks.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:50:05
He's not available right now, he's living the high life with your money.

You mean transaction malleability...the term of the week last week. It's a crock of shit. While possible, it's much more likely that it was a good old fashioned scam.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:21:39
Why isn't the Yakuza involved?
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:48:42
Probably just ran to Starbucks...I bet they'll brb.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:43:42
This is why you don't get invited to parties.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:21:08
This is why we don't have pinkies.

I'm also waiting for Andreas to weigh on on todays events.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:19:21
They're all busy suing TEPCO.

He was spotted at a Starbucks in Paris:

Here, have a downvote.
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:37:34
okay. fine.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:16:20
At least Bernie Madoff issued a statement.
@_date: 2014-02-14 12:58:36
Do you live in a cave?

5th time posted this hour. Please remove.

You certainly can't get BTC from his corpse...

Everyone likes twinkies...

Mark goes to starbucks. Takes your money. That's the loophole.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:13:58
Starbucks and obesity?
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:16:41
Fatty spent them at Starbucks, you didn't hear?
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:05:59
Surely there were a lot of phone calls and emails. Guys who ordinarily don't work together came together for the sake of bitcoin. I could easily see that taking 6 hours to coordinate.
