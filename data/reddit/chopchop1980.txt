That's probably what's going to happen there's no way they can ignore reality forever. Crypto is inevitable and one day people will probably even pay for facebook ads with it.

I read this as well..I even saw one day it will reach $700,000 according to an investment banker. One step at a time but its definite growing value is the main takeaway.

Interesting point, but I don't think the ads were just for the currencies but also services relating to crypto such as wirex, coinbase, etc. I guess the equivalent would be them banning standard bank ads.

The monthly subscription/no trading fee is clever. This will definitely attract people from all over the world. Overall this is great for the crypto market!

Great news for Crypto's reputation. Hopefully other state governments will follow lead.

There is no entirely decentralised alternative, but more decentralised, such as litecoin or zcash

I guess they find it less intimidating because it's not physical and young people already have a hard time understanding the true value of money.

This is great for the future of crypto! Looks like blockchain lolapalooza lol

South Africa is progressive with all things crypto. Bravo. Hopefully the rest of Africa follows their example.

This is genius considering the younger generation will probably pay their bills in digital currency..

Enticing title, but the article doesn't actually say how Blockchain will help them recover..

Cash is no longer king.. The end of an era. Good news for crypto, but will probably take some getting used to..

64,000$ by 2019 man
@_date: 2018-05-15 19:35:18
Any idea as to how long that could take?
@_date: 2018-05-15 20:17:59
Seems legit. Having standard bank details online has become dangerous. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 20:11:56
Wouldn't that technically be considered economics? At least they're learning something that is used in real life..
@_date: 2018-05-15 20:26:28
Seems exaggerated. Investors stated it was at 1.6 billion...
@_date: 2018-05-15 19:20:07
Seems on the safe side considering I've been reading on multiple sources that it should be around $64,000 by 2019..
