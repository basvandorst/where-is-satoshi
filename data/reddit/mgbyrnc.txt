like i said, research it for yourself
research why devs quit the bcash project
research what happened when they were trying to "collaboratively" decide on a new DAA
and just like my other response, if you choose to believe that im completely making all of this up, dont even respond to this, i could not care less
quite frankly ive moved on from caring about bcash at all.  it is stagnant and im making a ton of money on other projects
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:06:12
you are still not getting it
i do not give a fuck if you want evidence
you can either ignore me and assume im making everything up or go find the evidence yourself
and i care so little about what you do im going to ask you to please not respond to this
@_date: 2018-01-20 08:03:47
if true then good work
i made a killing on alts in the past few months
now to time the next bullrun

actually i would argue that you are the one not seeing the deeper meaning
but ok now i realize that you're an altcoin shill... that's fine
LN is coming... but for now answer me this question: why was gold used as a store of value for thousands of years?

bitcoin and alts have correlation because of exchanges where you can trade between them without converting to fiat at all
for example if btc is low compared to ltc you can swap ltc-&gt;btc and then when the btc raises and ltc falls you can go btc-&gt;ltc 
its just a trading strategy
hashrate has nothing to do with this, that is a different subject

The funny thing is that bcash shills are lying
They aren’t doing tx. They are hodling their shitcoin bags.  They scream about tx fees to try and bamboozle noobs into pumping their bags. 
I’ve talked with so many of those fucking degenerate shills.  Get them talking long enough and they eventually admit that they are hodling bcash in hopes that it gains more adoption.  They aren’t doing tx

Bcash is a joke
They recently published a paper saying that their future
plan is for huge mining centers being the only ones who would run full nodes and they would need to spend millions on data storage and super fast internet to store and propagate huge blocks.

when 99.99% of the engineers are on one team the real question is why does anyone take the other team seriously?
roger ver has been outted by former moderators for buying sock puppets.  he has been caught sending bch to random tweeters with 10k+ followers to shill bch.  his sock puppets have been caught hacking reddit accounts and using vote bots.
meanwhile the "sockpuppets of a development group" is a conspiracy theory which has been debunked dozens of times and has no real evidence behind it.

in this case the objective use value would be secure SoV as enabled by immutability and deflationary monetary policy
therefore the use value would be enabled by the properties that make it the best SoV in the world
why would anyone transact with a currency when they have no confidence in its ability to store value?

I agree it is a problem.  I think in 2018 there will be competitors to bitmain.  Also there are lots of miners popping up in Russia and in Canada.  I’m hoping that mining will become more decentralized in the future.

I don’t really get what you’re trying to get at here.  This is the bitcoin subreddit.  If discussion of any and all altcoins were allowed with no restraint this place would soon become flooded with shills and pumpers.  That’s not the kind of environment that fosters interesting discussion. 
I’ve seen people discuss most of the main alts here a lot. But when people start spamming and obvious pumping/shilling they get moderated - as they should. 
Just look at you right now.  It’s obvious that you are denigrating bitcoin and pumping your altcoin bcash.  But I don’t see you getting banned.  As long as you keep the discussion civil and don’t shill too hard everyone is cool. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:43:13
Imagine the properties of gold.  Immutable and rare. 
Now imagine that nobody can seize it from you.  
Now imagine you can transfer it over the internet without trusting anyone to facilitate that
It’s actually better than gold because the supply of bitcoin is capped whereas gold miners can just mine more by digging deeper. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:24:19

Do you have any solutions to propose? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:00:34
seems like a rather old comment.  do you think it's possible that the current LN concept requires segwit?
second layer solutions need a way to refer to unsigned tx
all of these protocols involve a funding tx which outputs to a 2of2 multisig which is what the protocol is executed on.  this creates privacy since if the protocol is completed the results is that the 2of2 multisig spend is indistinguishable from every other 2of2  multisig spend
the tx in the second layer need to be signed in reverse order to ensure that the protocol is started or that it fails.  this means that the funding tx needs to be written and subsequent tx need to refer to the funding tx while it is unsigned
segregating the signature witness is what creates the trustlessness and the privacy of the lightning network
the malleability fix is a side effect - which, might i add, bcash copy/pasted the segwit malleability fix in verbatim.  the bcash devs are not intelligent enough to write such code themselves
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:11:58

Bch forked off in August and they removed segwit (an important malleability fix) from the code
They have not made any improvements since then

the amount of money needed depends on the mcap of the coin
most discord pump and dump channels only pump random altcoins with low mcap
whereas a larger altcoin like bcash requires people with significant money to pump, like roger and jihan

of course its pretty unlikely for a pump and dump on a semi-popular coin to be proven because the expression of intent would be contained within the few whales doing it
but there are many discord servers that do pump and dumps on smaller coins and its pretty blatant looking at the price charts when they do it

Question was already answered in the op
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:28:09
Yes.  Because you are selling a certain amount of bitcoin
Like if you bought 3 bitcoin for $1000 and then it went to $3000
Withdrawing $1000 would be selling 1 bitcoins or $333 of your original investment. So you would need to pay tax on $667 capital gains.

A Blockchain is rendered immutable by mining.  There has to be incentive for people to mine.  A currency itself in a mining (block) reward and transaction fees create that incentive. 
Therefore any Blockchain that isn’t a currency has no hope of being immutable thus making it worthless.

no they are not because users run full nodes and enforce the consensus rules


this is only possible if the blocksize is so high that full node operation is unattainable for normal users.  only when miners control most of the nodes can they accomplish this exploitation.  this is why core is extremely reluctant to increase the block size any further.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:17:43
Ok thanks for the tip.  I don’t own any gold though. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:35:03
demand &gt; supply
edit: a more serious answer is people finally accepted bitcoin as a solid store of value
a transactional crypto will never shoot up because people simply exchange fiat for it, then trade it, then the receiver sells it for fiat.  the absence of HODLers causes the demand and supply to always be somewhat equalized
with bitcoin people are HODLing which causes a decrease in the sell side of the market
so, once again, demand&gt;supply
this is why anyone who is pumping their altcoin with claims like "cheap tx, fast tx" is actually trying to bamboozle you.  they are pumping the transactional nature of their coin while they are NOT doing transactions themselves.  they are HODLing the coin while pumping it under a false premise.

everybody's situation is different
if you store your money in bitcoin and you must use it to survive then you obviously convert to fiat and then buy food
unless youve somehow found a grocer that accepts bitcoin, which i think you havent
most people do not have 100% of their money in bitcoin
also i did not say to store fiat, you are putting words in my mouth.  i keep enough fiat around to transact with because it is the most efficient means of transacting

The miners job is to secure the network. If they use a 51% attack it is just as satoshi said - they undermined the validity of their wealth.   The network (users) would no longer trust them to secure the network.  Their proof of work would no longer be accepted.  This makes all the money they spent on their mining operation go to waste.  It is much more profitable to play by the rules. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:40:07
Wrong 
For LN you need a way to refer to unsigned tx. Which is what segwit does. 
In order for BCH to have LN it needs to have 100% of the capability of segwit.  But they will not call it segwit because they are dishonest.  The bch devs don’t even have the skill to code an alternate version of segwit.  They will just copy paste it in under the radar.  They already did this with half of segwit.  I forgot which exact BIP but you can look in both codebases and see half the segwit code in bch verbatim.  
Stop spreading lies please.

they dont batch transactions, they dont use segwit.  they basically do everything fucking wrong and their customers foot the bill

i know full well that bitcoin is a peer to peer currency.  im not arguing about what bitcoin IS.  im saying WHY i think satoshi made bitcoin.  this is the key distinction that you, and many other low IQ people in this thread are missing
i do NOT think satoshi made bitcoin so you could buy coffee in a cute way, he made it to undermine the central banking system
also if we want to argue real life usage... bitcoin was extremely low value when people were just using it transactionally.  its only real use was on darknet markets.  now people are pumping money into it because they view it as a trustworthy store of value.  thats why the price is so high now.

its just an altcoin which retains a stable value of $1 usd.
And if you convert to tether you don’t have to pay tax
It’s a good way for whale investors to get into the crypto game because banks are so crippled
A bank would refuse to buy 50mil of crypto for a whale.  But tether will give them 50m of tether if they prove collateral.  
Basically they saw a need for institutional level onramp and they made a product to meet this demand.  Tether is used to buy all cryptos, not just bitcoin.

second layer solutions need a way to refer to unsigned txs (what segwit allows)
the txs in the second layer need to be signed in reverse order to ensure that the protocol is started or that it fails. this means that the funding tx needs to be written and subsequent txs need to refer to the funding tx while it is unsigned
the malleability fix is secondary to this concept in regards to LN

It’s not circular reasoning.  Bitcoins value is derived directly from its scarcity and immutability. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:11:09
second layer solutions need a way to refer to unsigned txs (what segwit allows)
the txs in the second layer need to be signed in reverse order to ensure that the protocol is started or that it fails. this means that the funding tx needs to be written and subsequent txs need to refer to the funding tx while it is unsigned
the malleability fix is secondary to this concept in regards to LN

i didnt see your google search at first so i edited my post with this
edit: okay i should have clarified what i meant about engineer support - i meant accomplished blockchain engineers and their opinion about the scaling debate. i didnt mean actual contributors to the project. FURTHERMORE, you linking those stats just shows you have no idea about the real development process for either project. it is well known in the community that bcash is highly dev-centralized, where 1 guy (deadalnix) basically calls all the shots and pushes code without peer review. at least 1 of the "main" bch devs quit the project because of this.

Bitcoin's entire value proposition is that it is decentralized and immutable
no other crypto does this as well and quite frankly probably never will
one of the key components to bitcoin's decentralization is that satoshi is gone/dead
ALL of the altcoins are centralized.  They have leaders, controlling groups, special interests, premines, central points of failure.  This is why they can not compete.

Hold right on up there kiddo.  Bcash and s2x are not good in theory.  They are fucking awful.  The main component of bitcoin is decentralization.  
Full node count scales inversely with blocksize
Increasing the block size quite literally kills decentralization

okay you're wrong.  SoV is demand in of itself
youve been trained in keynesian economics, bitcoin was created under the austrian model
gold is a great store of value simple because of the two things you said, scarce and durable
bitcoin is therefore an even better store of value because its scarcity is clearly defined by a protocol which is safeguarded by over ten thousand full nodes
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:28:21

decentralization is with full node proliferation, not with miners
if miners try any funny shit we full node users will invalidate their proof of work
this means that their multi-million dollar investment in their mining operation will be worthless

First of all the dev centralization has been debunked many times. 
Secondly, even if the dev team was centralized why would I care as long as they are doing things that I agree with?
I would rather have one team of the best devs on the planet than 3 competing teams of incompetents.
I don’t know why you’re bringing up tx fees like a broken record.  I do not care about tx.  I am not a crypto noob who you can bamboozle with your shill tactics.  The very basis of your shill narrative is an obfuscation.  You are pumping a deflationary altcoin under the basis of transacting with it when you are not doing so yourself.  You are holding a bag for the purpose of capital gains.

why do i need to link sources?  i have no obligations towards you
if you are actually curious about it you can find the proof for what i said with google or reddit search
the best thing to do is to get involved with twitter
the people on twitter are generally more plugged in than redditors so you can get all the juiciest info
thats how i learned about roger paying $20k USD to tweeters :)
edit: okay i should have clarified what i meant about engineer support - i meant accomplished blockchain engineers and their opinion about the scaling debate.  i didnt mean actual contributors to the project.  FURTHERMORE, you linking those stats just shows you have no idea about the real development process for either project.  it is well known in the community that bcash is highly dev-centralized, where 1 guy (deadalnix) basically calls all the shots and pushes code without peer review.  at least 1 of the "main" bch devs quit the project because of this.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:29:50
The market has already spoken dumbass
Nobody was interested in crypto as a transactional medium
As soon as everyone learned of its value as a speculative deflationary asset the price exploded
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:26:10
if 1 engineer (garzik) tries to overrule 20+ engineers (core team) then i would sure as fuck hope the "inept users" would block the 1 engineer
you fucking doofus
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:56:53
You 2x shills keep saying “it’s just a simple blocksize increase”
Yet you never admit that the main effect of increasing the blocksize is increasing the mining centralization
I mean who cares that 99% of devs think it’s a terrible idea?  A bunch of ceos think it’s great so let’s just do a malicious hard fork!!
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:13:00
Actually bcash exists to make Jihan and Roger rich.
I can only imagine how hard Jihans tiny wiener gets when he sees all you shills shilling his shitcoin LOL

the question is not which side is right.  the question is why do people even consider the other side?
they are roger ver's cult and 99% of blockchain engineers oppose them

Switch to a Chinese centralized altcoin that brags about being useful as a transactional medium?   What’s the point?  I have a Visa card 
If the real bitcoin dies then crypto is a failed concept
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:22:41
im not an engineer
but i trust that engineers know what they are talking about in relation to this technology
so when i see 99% of intelligent technical people like andreas a and nick szabo fully supporting bitcoin
and charlatans and salesmen like roger ver and fake satoshi supporting bcash
the choice is obvious to me
but the "rich boys" as you say may look at it differently
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:56:35
how much are you willing to put down?
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:46:33
Why?  Segwit increases the use cases of bitcoin.  Increasing block size doesn’t.  Actually increasing block size just increases centralization with no benefit
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:59:39
Please stop parroting Roger salesman Ver and use your brain
Small scale consumer payments is one small aspect of what makes up a currency. Much less a global decentralized immutable currency 
You keep copy pasting rbtc catchphrases but you literally cannot explain why i should trade my bitcoin for a popsicle when the bitcoin will be worth more tomorrow and the popsicle will be worth less

luke jr is one of many core devs and he has probably contributed more to the bitcoin code than anyone from the bcash team
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:38:11
ive read it bud
if all the miners switch bcash that doesnt make it bitcoin lol
miners come and go
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:41:00
Wow man calm down
Currently bitcoin has grown a bit too fast. But don’t you worry the infrastructure is being upgraded by the best blockchain devs on the planet
Bitcoin is still a baby currency on the grand scale and when it blooms the world will never look back
Treating it as a speculative asset is working for now to get it out in the public.  To make it mainstream
The general public does not care about a little internet currency as a payment method because no matter how you slice it.  It is inferior to visa and Paypal, for now
Once Wall st buys in this further legitimizes bitcoin in the eyes of the world and more and more people will start buying in
All the while this is happening the infrastructure is being upgraded to facilitate the transition to when it will be used by billions as an every day medium of exchange 
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:35:50
What do you define as “so much traction”?
From my point of view they had zero dev support and very little community support
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:11:14
increasing 1000% in a year tends to make people listen
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:50:53

Because if it replaces fiat then it will never be “sold” for fiat and therefore isn’t subject to capital gains tax
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:03:24
Ah the confusion troll. Good one
You want to call bitcoin bitcoin segwit because you don’t like segwit
So I drew an analogy with calling bcash bcash asicboost. Because i don’t like asicboost
But why make things more complicated than they need to be?  Let’s just keep it simple and stick with bitcoin and bcash
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:44:58

Very interesting 
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:57:38

@_date: 2017-11-21 18:09:41
Alright thanks
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:20:03
Dunno what you mean by segwit experiment failure
Segwit development was halted to create defenses against the s2x attack
Now that the attack is gone development can continue on segwit and lightning network 
And yes i fully support bitcoin because it has the best devs. The best roadmap. The best everything - with the one exception of fees.  And that is temporary
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:28:29
you mean like paypal?
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:21:12
Why not both.  But less of each
Also take time to educate them about it

Just because he said he supported it doesn’t mean jack shit
Haven’t you gotten the picture yet?   Roger and jihan LIE so they can profit

so what?
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:30:09
btc will never accept the core devs
and bitcoin will never accept charlatans like roger ver
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:30:09
Imo a POW change should be considered ASAP.  As well as a difficulty adjustment algo change
Mining is dangerously centralized and these past few months is proof that jihan is fucking with us

it was an attempt by several corporate CEOs and mining pool CEOs to increase the max blockweight
it was cancelled due to overwhelming community opposition
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:06:44
Sure man.  Bch is basically a cheap knockoff that is controlled by Roger and a Chinese dude named Jihan Wu.  Roger refers to bch as “my product” and “my project”
Bitcoin was originally designed to be uncontrollable and decentralized - the opposite of what bch is.  So naturally bch is quite repugnant to everyone who loves what bitcoin stands for.  
It’s very sad that Roger is able to get on shows like that and deceive newbies.  He is definitely the most toxic force in the crypto space right now. 
He was shunned by the bitcoin community for continuous shady behavior and scam attempts.  The problem is that he is a megalomaniac.  He considers himself to be a visionary and a revolutionary.  He wants to be the next Elon musk and he couldn’t achieve that in bitcoin.  So now he has created a pseudo-cult around himself in the bch community. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:24:12

alright, do you have any more examples?
just so you know i dont really care about about name calling

rbtc doesnt like bitcoin anymore
they only like altcoins.  whatever altcoin roger ver is pumping at the time
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:35:45
If you break the rules you get your post deleted or banned if it’s repeated 
Pumping altcoins (such as bcash) is against the rules 
Rbtc dudes love to pump bcash.  So they get banned.  That’s not abuse, that’s enforcing the rules.

when the price goes down people are excited to buy more for a cheaper price
"buy the dip" is basically a meme here
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:49:05


not only do they have the mining centralization they have... this may seem odd but i believe it's true-
they have psychological control over their community - i have been there (to their subreddit) and it is literally like a cult.  i pretended to be a newbie and they said to me "we have people like roger to guide us"
note: this could be an illusion created by the fact that many of the people there are actually paid employees of roger ver

saying to change the whitepaper is an overreaction but consider the following
the problem is that the whitepaper is vague in certain areas
this vagueness allows attackers and scammers like roger and jihan to twist the words in it to suit their nefarious purposes
if you actually read the whitepaper you would realize this
one example of word-twisting that they do is when satoshi is describing the scenario of a 51% attack
the s2x proponents tried to twist the scenario of a 51% attack to fit their scenario of a chainsplit attack
these are two completely different situations and the whitepaper does not even address a chainsplit attack
so to anyone getting riled up about this... calm down... your use brain... analyze what the whitepaper says... analyze how the enemies of bitcoin are trying to twist the words within it so they can profit
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:49:59
"The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to
assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it
to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to
find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than
everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth." -Satoshi Nakamoto

its a pump and dump
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:35:41
Sorry but it’s just objective fact that hard forking an alt coin with the stated attempt to steal hashpower is an attack
I’m not making it up.  These are the bch designers talking about it
The basic market appeal is vastly outweighed by the fact that bch is insanely miner centralized.  Has no good devs.  Has no good scaling plan.  And is pumped by 2 known scammers Roger and Craig.
The market isn’t retarded.  Sure you may be able to convince your local sandwich shop to accept bch.  But anyone intelligent can see that it’s rotten under the hood 
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:07:09
This is wrong lol
The core devs post here every time there’s a new release

you bought a certain amount of bitcoin
so lets say you bought at $5000, you would get 0.1 bitcoin
then if bitcoin goes to $6000 your 0.1 bitcoin would be worth $600

@_date: 2017-11-12 07:03:23
thats not how it works
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:37:35
listen carefully my friend
there are only 2 cryptos you should buy
bitcoin for 99.99% of cases
and monero if you want to do anonymous illegal stuff
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:17:47
They said segwit!  It’s a conspiracy!!
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:36:26
Lol.  If you’re so certain of a death spiral just short bitcoin.  See how that works out for you
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:02:57
then bitcoin is a failed concept
and people can choose to use the corporate controlled coin if they want
id imagine lots of people would either continue to support a lesser-valued bitcoin or possibly switch to litecoin if the network is completely dead
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:09:41
Yes please.  Sorry I can’t read your mind when you say vague stuff.  I’m curious about your opinion
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:13:50
the best strategy is to buy bitcoin and then never read anything on the internet for 5 years
there is a ton of money going towards marketing and social engineering for one purpose: getting people to sell their bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:59:31
That’s nice
Too bad Jihan has already mined hundreds of thousands of coins :)
You can’t fix a sinking ship with duct tape
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:41:08
Ok.  So basically short sellers will get wrecked so hard that the winners won’t get paid.  And that’s bad
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:33:50
interesting article
2 things stick out to me
1) the fact that chinese mining moguls think they have any right to dictate the future of ANYTHING.  maybe in a decentralized mining situation, but that shit dont fly today
2) the total lack of mentioning that 80% of the bch volume was from 1 korean exchange (some really weird shit going on there)
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:14:13
Nobody knows for sure what will happen
But look... right now bitcoin has a lot of virulent competition and they spread FUD like it’s their job (sometimes it is their job)
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:43:55
core and cash can coexist but its not optimal
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:20:29
sweet :D
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:54:33
I don’t feel confused or uncertain
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:38:48
or have you been brain washed?
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:31:17
Disagree.  Roger was not more knowledgeable, he was just better at this sort of live discussion due to experience.  Roger has bullet points that he hits in every interview.  He is so predictable that it’s actually a shame that John didn’t simply watch Roger’s interview with Richard Heart and come prepared to smash every point. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:56:01
A change can not be made without overwhelming approval from all the devs, blockstream or not.  So yes that’s correct
And let’s just say it wasn’t blockstream that vetoed the blocksize increase.  It was pretty much every single core dev
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:38:47
Lol whoever wrote that is a tard
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:04:17
You should ask them yourself why they don’t support bigger blocks
I’m sure they have stated it many times on twitter or reddit and other places
Dividing bitcoin into 2 competing networks just as a test... well you’re a troll so you already know this is a really bad idea
S2x was meant to be a simply blocksize increase.  It was cancelled because he majority of the community opposed it. That’s how bitcoin does upgrades.  Consensus or it doesn’t go through. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:17:31
Buy and hold bitcoin for several years
Don’t fuck around with mining
Hold your bitcoin in paper or hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:11:08
can you just make your point here so i dont have to read it?
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:39:46
Development is making progress
Man... bitcoin is like 80% perfect with the other 20% being fully functional but not completely optimized
But you people still do nothing but complain

@_date: 2017-11-07 01:47:34
like i said i'm just going off of their publicly released statements
but.. i honestly think it's a result of their hubris
they thought that if all of their companies came together and agreed that the public would magically fall into line and agree
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:14:26
did you just compare visa to bitcoin
the bigger the blocks get the more centralized the system becomes
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:54:53
How do you classify the nya if not a corporate takeover?
It’s a bunch of dudes who signed an agreement behind closed doors to attempt to hijack the bitcoin brand name with a malicious alt coin 
That’s why they keep screaming the false statement “hashpower is consensus” because they have tiny dick corporate Jihan throwing his hashpower around on their side
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:24:58
nobody here believes he is satoshi
there is another sub full of mongoloids who do believe it though,  rbtc &lt;- you should try there

thats not funny thats tragic
and roger ver is to blame
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:14:52
Ok ok fine. He only mined 80-90% of them
Look man.  The only chance bcash has is propaganda and rhetoric so good luck with that
Any intelligent person can look at the fuckery going on underneath the hood and will stay away lol
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:50:20
its funny what can happen when a centralized coin has a CEO and a director of marketing and director of mining operations ;)

No sorry you just haven’t proven your premise
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:08:34
the core devs get paid way less working on bitcoin than they would be able to make elsewhere

Going long on altcoins is ideologically similar to shorting bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:56:06
You may care about the code. People with money don’t 
That’s why a premined shitcoin like bcash can get a 19b market cap

he is very knowledgeable.  i wanted to thank him for his post 
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:18:07
Why would you say that a centralized Chinese coin seems the most promising?
Bcash is literally a scam to make Jihan and Roger rich
Jihan is 80% of the mining power on bcash. Do you think he’s taking his bcash and using it for commerce lol?   He’s fucking selling it to retards.  That’s why he’s only accepting bcash for antminers now.  To artificially increase demand because he is THE ONLY SUPPLY OF BCASH
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:17:56
I think this is the new rbtc troll because if they shill too blatantly they get banned
Now it’s like a new tether post every 5 minutes
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:21:22
Lol look at all these altcoin shills in the bitcoin sub
Just buy and hold bitcoin my man. There may be better short term options but nothing is better long term.  Not even close
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:36:35
first of all, s2x doesnt "have" 84% of hashpower.  84% of hashpower is signalling that they will mine s2x after the hard fork
now - look up posturing
s2x would heavily benefit miners at the expense of decentralization
once the fork actually happens and the miners realize they will not make any money mining s2x they will come back to btc like good little greedy bitches
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:52:17
He’s such a charlatan lol
If he wasn’t a scammer he would sell all his bitcoin and buy bcash
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:17:23
Either high 9 or 10 digits
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:19:28
The idea in a decentralized system is to not idolize any group of people
To promote the core devs in this way goes against what bitcoin stands for
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:18:28
how crazy would it be if you asked a gypsy fortune teller to predict the price of bitcoin and she said it was going to dip after the hard fork
i would be freaked out
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:02:05
Do you have really big fat blocks that we can stuff with our dozens of tx tho?

Don’t listen to anyone who says “Blockchain not bitcoin”
Retarded af
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:07:07
So you basically just answered your own concern
Or do you think that even when bitcoin achieves mass adoption that people still will rarely use it for commerce?  Because that doesn’t make sense to me
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:32:35
Blockchain not bitcoin is just a catchphrase of people who don’t understand the tech
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:01:15
hes not dumb hes a bch shill

do yourself a favor and never go to rbtc again
reading their FUD seriously fucks with weak minded people
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:08:30
yea okay... "stefan kapetanovic"
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:24:15
considering coinbase's support of NYA and their shady press releases im definitely not keeping anything with them during the fork
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:17:32
Yea bitcoins popularity exploded which is causing some temporary problems.  It still is the only hope for the crypto sphere to be taken seriously. 
One could argue that a deflationary anything will never be suitable as a real means of exchange but only time will tell for that idea.  (Satoshi was not an economist)
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:27:13
It’s a mispelling of hold.  It just means don’t panic and sell your bitcoin when there’s a little turbulence 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:13:33
its just business
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:04:17
Can you show me where it says that

@_date: 2017-11-23 17:24:00
First of all.  You still haven’t proven that nurses are underpaid.  Nurses where I live make a ton of money and it seems like every young woman is going to nursing school because they know it pays well.  
Secondly I think that economic power distribution is a tough question.  Firstly, men built and maintain society and also risk their lives to defend it.  But on the other hand many times women sacrifice their earning potential to stay home and raise children, which is equally valuable in my opinion.   So - in order for economic power to be equitable the entire paradigm of society would need to shift - women would need to start working on societal maintenance jobs and men would need to start being caretakers more often.  The problem is that this goes against our evolution. So it is not optimal.  We would basically be arbitrarily forcing a less-functional society for the sake of equity based on emotion. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:55:08
i think personal finance is about stable long term investments
bitcoin is a currency and therefore is a speculation
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:55:00
what is there to address?  the fee market is functioning just fine
do you see any issue with the fact that spammers dont get their tx put into blocks instantly?  to me thats how it should work
the only silly thing is when bcash shills come in here and say retarded shit like "omg 100k tx backlog in the mempool!! the sky is falling!!"  -no idiot those are spam and they will get processed eventually
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:38:56
You’re right.  It was the same PoW algo combined with a difficulty adjustment algo that made bch more profitable to mine at certain times (at the expense of rampant inflation)
Also as other posters are saying.  Some Chinese miners like the fact that they can use the asicboost exploit which was intentionally left unpatched by the bch creators
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:45:34
my life is better than yours in every conceivable metric :)
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:49:41
you can already do tx for like 25 cents and it will go through quickly.  just find a wallet with the ability to set custom fees
the high fees/tx time is rhetoric created by bch shills while they were spamming the network as a coordinated attack of spam + hashpower reduction + social engineering
now that they ran out of spam juice, at least for now, the fees are low and the tx time is quick
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:47:34
sweeeet   whats your business?
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:39:38
yup i sure didnt because satoshi did the only thing that would work to make bitcoin decentralized - he stepped away
meanwhile jihan is over here controlling bcash, trolling on twitter
but yea once again, enjoy your jihancoin

Sorry I’m not the most knowledgeable about this sort of stuff

They implemented limits to futures trading so the price won’t fluctuate too wildly.

@_date: 2017-11-06 01:33:38
hmmm so you're saying an open source dev team with hundreds of participants can be more easily manipulated than huge mining pools controlled by a few chinese dudes who only care about $$
interesting theory....

If you are going to transact a lot I would recommend Litecoin.  This is only temporary until lightning network is implemented on bitcoin 
If you are looking long term bitcoin is the best choice
I advise you to stay away from Bitcoin Cash.  It is a Chinese pump and dump.  Pump and dump means it was created to make the creators rich. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:52:29

must have been a HUUUUGE support for s2x from Korea because thats where 80% of bcash's volume is coming from LOL
oh wait you're just parroting what roger told you to say smh
@_date: 2017-11-25 02:12:59

its adoption is outpacing its scaling, for now
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:58:27
Yes people get banned from both subreddits for breaking the rules
But what is the agenda of each?
As i just said.  This sub supports bitcoin 
Rbtc supports a Chinese altcoin
Take your pick
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:49:13
we try to educate them about how they can set custom fees


We do address it.  We tell everyone. Mempool is being spammed by Roger and Chinese.  Wait a few days for it to cool down and fees will return to normal. 
And since your post history betrays the fact that you’re a bcash shill I’d like to say more to you.  Your coin is a joke.  It’s shilled by a scammer and a Chinese miner.  It has higher fees than every other altcoin and is only somewhat popular due to brand hijacking.  Your community is a joke and people are intentionally making memes that they don’t even agree with just so you guys spam tips at them which they then convert to btc.  You worship Roger Ver like he’s your savior.  Nobody over there knows anything technical about bitcoin.  You guys talk shit on segwit without even realizing that bcash already integrated the signature signing and verification code from segwit.  90% of your trade volume is from a random korean exchange which totally exposes the coin as a fake pumped piece of shit rather than the organic growth that your sub would like to portray.  Also no businesses accept bcash and if they are smart they never will. Also your devs are shit and almost no technically minded people support you.

Most current data indicates women get paid more for the same job and same hours. 
The wage gap myth factors in ALL men and women at the yearly salary level.  And women are less likely to work as many hours, less likely to work at all.

tips for what?
if you are planning to hold for a long time i suggest transferring it to a wallet where you control the private key
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:04:10
We can’t force them to do anything
And their pumping of bcash is just a temporary thing
In reality they pump whatever Roger Ver tells them to pump
Shittalking bitcoin is a regular thing though
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:41:12
how are they gonna do that?
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:00:03
Yea it’s related in that it’s anti bitcoin and pro bcash lol
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:41:50
im starting to think s2x is an attempt to kill bitcoin completely and have everyone switch to bcash, which roger and jihan premined
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:11:16
holy shit... get your coins off that site asap
bitcoin.com is not a real bitcoin website

Lol wtf?
Bitcoin core refers to a version of software that runs nodes and a wallet or it could also refer to the open source dev team
Bitcoin is bitcoin or btc
Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash or bcash or bch

People will start using bitcoin en masse because of necessity.  Right now cash or visa or
Paypal is more efficient than any crypto because fiat is still somewhat working... for now.  That’s why bitcoin is being used widely in places like Venezuela and Zimbabwe - because their fiat systems collapsed.

wow you solved the simple conundrum that has baffled altcoin shills the world over.
the answer is - you wouldnt trade bitcoin for coffee unless you were very very stupid
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:18:44
Also look up bitmain (Jihan) mining empty blocks on purpose 
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:29:19
that creates tx backlog because im slow at counting
id rather just swipe my visa

@_date: 2017-11-16 16:18:11
You realize you can easily set a low fee.  It will just take a while to get processed.  And it will only take a while because bch is stealing hashpower
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:01:53
If you think bch is the son of btc you don’t understand btc
Btc is decentralized. Created by an anonymous person/group and maintained and updated by hundreds of devs from around the world
Bch is centralized.  Created by a conman and a Chinese mining mogul to make them money

Just curious which altcoin you think is better developed than bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:53:32
depends on when they sold but they probably have more value
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:39:18


here a quote from you from a few days ago
its funny how you will advise others to not trust this sub but then you make a new post here like "oh guys i am confused bcash doesnt seem so bad.  can u explain plsss??"
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:51:50
My “inability” to force the knowledge into that guy is simply because I’m out doing stuff and I don’t like typing on my phone. 
Also I truly feel like people would benefit more from reading experts writings on this subject rather than having me talk about it in a reddit post
If you have been around the bitcoin space for a while you’ll realize that people truly become knowledgeable by studying experts writings or listening to experts talks on YouTube.  Not by reading reddit posts from random people like myself. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:57:54
thats rather selfish of you
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:54:35
Thanks for explaining to people what’s going on. It’s funny how all of this talk is a bit technical.  Im afraid people not in the space will be left scratching their heads. 
As for when you asked if the screaming people like Ryan Charles are ignorant or malicious.  I’m curious about this too
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:32:42
uh huh
and what about the huge spam of $1 tx paying fees of $5?
nah thats just "people sending money where they want"  totally natural
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:33:53
it was pretty insane.  especially when he called it "my project"
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:24:04
What you just said is EXACTLY what I referred to with my first post
You are looking to save a buck on tx fees with the trade of supporting a centralized coin controlled by Jihan and Roger. 
I really don’t get why people think that’s a good trade
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:00:35
lol dude are you serious?
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:02:18
yea so much argument /s
who should we believe?  the engineers or roger ver?  omg tough decision (thinking hard)

@_date: 2017-11-07 02:18:01
it's a flaw in the original design (sorry satoshi ball-lickers)
satoshi never predicted the level of miner centralization that we have today
if we let miners control bitcoin we are basically just handing control over to the chinese government (where the majority of hashpower is)

Bitcoin is supported by 9 years of hard work and experience and the best devs
Bcash is pumped by a Chinese mining mogul and a snakelike salesman and I’m betting it will dump soooo hard when it’s listed on Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:02:03
Ok this article has been reposted about 20 times today and it starts right off the bat with a giant lie


Nope. 
It then continues to frame the argument as pragmatists (s2x) versus traditionalists (bitcoin)
This is typical of s2x and bcash shills to try to portray s2x as benign and even beneficial
And then the article concludes especially retardedly


Sorry but shrugging off a corporate/miner takeover reinforces bitcoins threat to the establishment 
All in all this is a subtle s2x/bcash shill article and it makes sense that you would repost it because your reddit profile says active on rbtc
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:21:05

"rbtc does censor" "rbtc does not censor"
the proof for both is the same - produce the mod logs
you are demanding that i produce the mod logs - and to that i say, no you do it yourself
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:40:52
Now you’re just parroting FUD from rbtc.  Core is implementing smart solutions to scaling rather than just “let’s increase the blocksize ad infinitum”

yep the korean exchange again... something really fishy about that
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:05:35


the thing about banks is that you have to ask the bank to transfer the money.  with bitcoin you transfer the money.  thats the key difference


some people like being in control of their money instead of relying on a bank


yup, dont use bitcoin to order pizzas.  that would be retarded.  imagine how dumb someone would have to be to exchange the worlds most bullish commodity for food


well bitcoin hasnt been hacked since its creation with people trying constantly.  seems pretty strong imo


ok cool?

i think you need to do a little more research into roger vers background
get back to me when you do
furthermore you completely misconstrued my point - intentionally i think, because thats what trolls do.  im saying id rather listen to engineers' opinions on the future of this technology than a salesman like roger.  what are rogers technical qualifications again?  he invested in bitcoin?  give me a break.  heres the thing about salesmen - they are always trying to sell you something
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:24:06
The white paper is vague on certain points
It didn’t predict mining centralization
It didn’t predict chain split attacks
It didn’t predict social media attacks
It didn’t predict asicboost

will moon when it's listed on CME - bitcoin
building a decentralized and immutable base layer and adding more advanced layers on top of a solid foundation - bitcoin
built a centralized base layer and will just keep making that layer fatter and more centralized with no technological advancement - bcash
support from bitcoin OG pioneers (nick szabo, adam back) - bitcoin
support from non-technical businessmen (pump and dump (roger, jihan, craig)) - bcash
rampant inflation due to retarded difficulty adjustment code, making jihan super rich at the expense of idiots who buy in - bcash

I love presuppositions like this
Look dude. Use segwit.  It’s really cheap.  Or use a wallet that lets you set custom fees.  It’s really cheap.  
I know Roger vers website sets the fees super high on purpose but people shouldn’t be using that
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:52:00


i didnt call you a troll, i said this is exactly what trolls and altcoin shills spam in this sub all day every day.  its just a FUD hypothesis that you state as if it's a fact
does that make you a troll just because you said something trollish?  maybe, im willing to give you the benefit of the doubt and believe youre just scared

i thought we were going to start calling big blockers paypal 0.5

they are going to adjust the difficulty so blocks come every 10 minutes
some might argue that their proposed difficulty adjustment algo is more efficient than bitcoin's
i think their's will adjust difficulty quite often, where bitcoin is waiting for 2000? blocks before it adjusts
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:40:42
Oh look more slithery disengenuousness 
You were prompted to make this thread because you were recently on r/btc and got all hyped up on their propaganda. 
Your post history says it all. Nevermind the fact that you continually and purposefully conflate blockstream and core
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:37:48
Why are you demanding that I do the research work for you. And yea my bad I shouldn’t use quotes for paraphrasing.  But you got the point. You know full well what scams Roger has been involved in.  Your post history indicates you are knowledgeable albeit bamboozled. 
But here you go anyway 
Just google Roger Ver mt gox 
That’s one of many scams in his history 
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:36:10
mmmk bud
"centralized mining and control isnt centralization"
have fun with that theory
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:27:48
Okay you’re right.  I reread the tweet
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:50:30
We are going through tough times right now there’s no doubt about it
A scamming piece of shit owns the rbtc subreddit and bitcoin.com.  This is not good for publicity
Also theres a massive social engineering campaign against bitcoin going on right now paid for by said scammer and his chinese scamming buddy (talking about Roger Ver and Jihan Wu if you didn’t know)
So ya... if you are doing remittances and need lower fees then i recommend litecoin for now.  But rest assured bitcoin will solve these temporary problems in the future
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:21:24
settle down there doofy
go stare at your framed portrait of roger and repeat after me "roger is my daddy and i want his bcash all over my face, give it to me daddy aaaaaah"
except its a trick!  as soon as you close your eyes your other daddy jihan swoops in and explodes his sticky bcash all over your cute face.  roger takes half the credit for it though

@_date: 2017-11-11 19:25:44
hi friendlynegro
here in the crypto space there are 3 dudes named roger ver, jihan wu, and craig wright
they continually do what's known as a "pump and dump" where they inflate the price of an alt coin that they created and then sell it to make a lot of money quickly
the reason they are able to do this is because roger ver owns the subreddit rbtc and the website bitcoin.com as well as owning multiple marketing companies which employ countless paid shills - this allows him to run a moderately-effective propaganda campaign for all of his pump and dumps
jihan wu is in on it because he controls an extremely large mining operation in china and he also handles the chinese side of the propaganda
craig wright gets in on it because some people (idiots) believe that he is satoshi nakamoto (he is not) so they treat his word as gospel
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:20:13
If you use the unanimous definition then upgrades  never occur because people like Roger Ver can hire shill farms from Russia and Brazil and he also leads his personal cult at rbtc
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:51:20

Look into the dev work on the lightning network.  If it works as planned it will solve your worries
Think of it like this.  Currently bitcoin can do around 4 transactions per second with 1mb blocks.  Bcash can do around 30 transactions per second with 8mb blocks.  Visa can do 30000 transactions per second. 
Now taking this data ask yourself.  Is increasing the block size the proper solution for mass adoption commerce?

How’s it going bud?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:36:36
yea thats a pretty blatant troll post that he got banned for
its obvious when someone is a regular on rbtc (can look at post history) then comes here and says stuff like "i dont understand"  "im just trying to understand"
basically just str8 trolling lol.  good riddance to those people
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:00:02
okay well i dont understand anything in that article, however, the comments seem to think its FUD
the article continually repeats the catch phrase "technical debt" but i do not believe it effectively demonstrates that, at least in a way that i can understand
so *shrug*
as for me my coins are in a legacy address and i plan to keep them there.  however if i was somehow forced to put them in a segwit address i wouldnt care

no im actually curious about why people oppose it
im not an engineer so all i can really do is trust the vast majority of the blockchain engineering community when they say segwit is great
id like to see an engineering perspective of why segwit is bad
and also im curious about your personal reasons for not wanting to use it
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:06:27
Nah man that’s not how it works
There’s bitcoin
And then there’s 1000+ altcoins
Some of the altcoins use the bitcoin name in their name to take advantage of the brand recognition
Bcash is an especially malicious altcoin because it was designed to make Jihan Wu filthy rich 
Please don’t let the shills over at rbtc bamboozle you

“A group of prominent developers” wanted the hardfork?  No. Non-technical people such as CEOs and miners wanted it 
Almost all of the prominent developers opposed it

Let’s talk about why you reject their scaling roadmap bud
Do you want to have terabyte blocks in the future where the only full nodes are in corporate data centers. (Kinda like how banks are today)
Or do you want to continue on with a truly decentralized system like bitcoin does?

what sounds better to a merchant?
1. hmm i can accept this weird alternative currency that i can then go through a lot of trouble converting to USD so i can pay my bills
2. i should accept bitcoin cuz the price is going through the roof and if i sell a pizza for $20 today then that bitcoin could easily be worth $30 tomorrow due to reservation demand
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:01:36
its just a propaganda rhetoric tactic
many ignorant people get triggered by the word "bankers"
basically banks invest in most decently sized companies.  blockstream happens to be a decently sized company and therefore attracted investors, some of which may be banks

@_date: 2017-11-15 00:45:01
the bottleneck is because of bcash stealing hashpower
the bitcoin system was not designed to accommodate a coordinated pump of a PoW-competing altcoin (that happened to have a PoW bug at the time causing it to mine 1 block per minute) as well as a well-funded social engineering attack
im sure the core devs have learned from this experience and are contemplating possible adjustments

there must be a good reason that no core dev (i think) aside from luke jr is in favor of pow change.  i would be interested in hearing their thoughts on this
hypothetically if the pow was changed wouldnt that leave bitcoin with very little hashpower?  like almost none comparative to what it has now?

quite frankly i think the answer is maybe.  thats how crazy certain NYA people are
imo it has a lot to do with china, but i could just be insane
1. china has a shitload of hashpower
2. china wants to control bitcoin
3. china is pumping bcash like crazy
4. china has professional shill roger ver in its back pocket - who just so happens to own the website bitcoin.com (a major oversight by satoshi)

its not vague its common knowledge

thats not how capitalism works.  in fact that's just morally offensive
women wont have similar economic power until they work the same types of jobs with a similar number of hours/overtime - which will not happen because of maternal instincts.  (and also women take more vacation... dont know what instinct to call this)

No I would not say all the alternatives are crap.  The thing is that crypto is all open-source.  So any innovation that an alt comes up with, if it is actually a good idea, will get implemented into bitcoin in the future. 
For example - ethereum has better smart contracting... for now
Monero has better privacy... for now
Litecoin has faster tx speeds and lower fees... for now
The best blockchain devs in the world are working on bitcoin and bitcoin only.  The future looks very bright.

those are satoshis words
he wrote that 10 years ago as an imagination of what things would be like in the future
fast forward to today and almost every single engineer supports offchain scaling including nick szabo who is the most likely case for being the real satoshi, if satoshi isnt dead
are we to believe that satoshis imagination from 10 years ago makes more sense for today's environment than what  nearly every blockchain engineer thinks today?
okay now that we've established that all the engineers support the direction of offchain scaling lets look at who is pushing onchain scaling -
roger ver (not an engineer, scam artist)
jihan wu (not an engineer, mining mogul who tries to gain power over bitcoin)
craig wright (fake satoshi, scam artist)

how do you think core devs should pay for their housing and food?  will you donate to them?  keep in mind that these are literally the best blockchain devs on the planet.  imagine what kind of salary they could demand working in the private sector.
hell if they wanted to any one of them could fork bitcoin or make an altcoin and make millions easy - just look how well it's working for jihan and roger who cant even write code

see the fact that you say "uses the white paper" instantly confirms to me that you have no idea what youre talking about
they forked bitcoin, fine, but then they put in a mining difficulty bug that allowed 1 chinese miner (jihan) to mine approximately 100,000 coins in a month
furthermore 80% of the mining is done by 1 source (listed as unknown, but obviously jihan)
these 2 facts alone make it so diversionary from the whitepaper that its a joke whenever bcash shills scream "whitepaper whitepaper!!"

@_date: 2017-11-13 23:26:31
Well this sub supports bitcoin
Rbtc is pumping a chinese altcoin
Maybe that will help you decide which one is better (lol)
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:17:37
Ya totally.  I have 100 tether bitcoins myself
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:33:35
they allowed their coin to become massively inflated to the tune of 100k+ coins for the purpose of "stealing hashrate from bitcoin"
that was the stated plan that they admitted themselves
why are you arguing against your own people lol?  they admitted it
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:45:08
naw cuz the bcash would stay with coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:49:32
have you tried having an actual discussion?
how many "actual discussion" threads have you created?
i promise there are people here who know their stuff, in fact a few of the core devs post here and answer questions 
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:28:09
big mining operations make big $$
but now they are getting greedy and want control in addition to $$.  this is not good
they are basically saying, hmm what if i poke the golden goose so it starts shitting bigger eggs.  well the goose is getting annoyed
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:58:17
they havnt received their check from roger yet
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:17:21
yea thats fine, go ahead and repost that because it contains links and facts
this thread is just a random dude masturbating
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:36:02
just the other day a shill was caught trying to purchase multiple "2 years old and good reputation" bitcointalk accounts
this shit is actually happening and i hope noobies dont fall for it
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:52:53
look at history
when a centralized power has the ability to do something for their benefit with no opposition they will do it
furthermore i dont think youve actually been paying attention to bcash
90% of trading volume comes from 1 small exchange in korea
if thats not some whale manipulation then i dont know what is
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:46:13
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:36:49
Go try both things then. See if anything cares 
Just don’t try to force your retarded views on this sub
You literally said that bitcoin shouldn’t defend its own brand.  How fucking retarded can you be
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:20:54
it means youre more stupid than regular stupid
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:35:46
Settle down over there shill boy
Bcash is a scam

Superior coin?  None exist bud
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:52:33
Your definition of an alt coin is worthless but by all means keep repeating your opinion
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:24:36
bcash is a chinese centralized pump and dump
but i guess if we point that out it's "superiority complex!"  "toxic!"
fuck off
@_date: 2017-11-09 05:32:10
it was never about scaling - its about control
the larger blocks become the more centralized the entire system becomes
the more centralized the system becomes the more the corporations can control it
this is why you always hear s2x/bcash shills screaming "HASHPOWER IS CONSENSUS" - because they know that the mining is heavily centralized and in the hands of just a few chinese CEOs
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:28:30
can i get some background on this?
who is he calling a dipshit and what did they do?
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:43:33
You’re arguing with a troll
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:44:58
The entire title of your thread is a gigantic false presupposition. But then again you already know that so why am I explaining it?
You purposefully and intentionally conflate blockstream and core
You are a shill for the ideas espoused on r/btc and no I do not think they will call you a shill for shilling their own ideas (facepalm) (and before you bring up payment again go look up the definition of shill)
You speak smoothly but all that comes out is already-debunked rhetoric
I can only imagine what the future will hold for your glorious reddit career.  On back to r/btc you can make the new thread “I tried to educate the stupids on r/bitcoin about the nefarious blockstream but they ad hominemed all over my face! Cry cry”
Get the fuck out of here

Rbtc is a shill and sock puppet pseudo-cult led by an influential figure named Roger Ver. 
Roger threatened that if bitcoin did not capitulate to the demands of corporations and miners to perform a contentious hard fork (s2x) that he would devote 100% of his energy to promoting bcash
The fork was cancelled and Roger followed through with his threat
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:52:59
Unpopular opinion : John wasn’t prepared enough for this discussion and came across looking silly when he kept saying “ok let’s move on”.  The proper way is to address all of the points fully and then move on.  
I would like to see someone who is a real expert have a discussion with Roger

I don’t think you’re getting the point
Their subreddit is called “btc” aka the abbreviation for bitcoin 
But all they do is talk shit on bitcoin and shill Rogers latest pump and dump.  Which is now bcash
You’re trying to come off as philosophical and impartial but you kinda just look like a clown.  No offense..........

Ok once again.  Bitcoin has billions of dollars in it including many people’s life savings.  I don’t give a shit if Greg Maxwell took a dump on a picture of Obama.  I want competent devs on bitcoin and I want incompetent devs like Jeff Garzik to stay the fuck away.  
You sound extremely immature to focus on your emotions regarding the core devs rather than the pragmatic aspect. 
Also I couldn’t care less about the ceo of Coinbase’s thoughts on the situation. He supported s2x and now he supports bcash.  His credibility as a competent thinker has gone out the window.  
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:57:01

@_date: 2017-11-16 15:50:12
This place would get overrun so quickly by Rogers enployees
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:21:55
It’s a pump and dump in the most literal sense
They have a mining difficulty bug which allows Jihan Wu to mine thousands of bcash easily and then he turns around and sells them to retards
The first dump already happened.  The second one will come soon
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:52:08
nah homeboy
youre perpetuating a malicious meme from rbtc
this meme is literally responsible for losing people thousands of dollars
they see btc correcting down a little bit and they think "OMG DEATH SPIRAL" so they sell and lose their money
get out of here please
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:57:37
There is if it uses the same PoW
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:55:39
bcash has a somewhat effective propaganda machine
It’s basically a money printing device for Jihan
A couple days ago a bcash shill was exposed buying “several years old” bitcointalk accounts with good reputation
Pumpers will pump i suppose.  But the bcash pumpers are exceptionally aggressive 
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:03:14
It’s called a pump and dump and the tards who actually believed Roger and Jihan get left holding the bag
It’s fucking sinister and roger and Jihan are to blame for causing innocent idiots to lose millions of $$
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:17:36
Why would anyone in their right mind mine jihans get rich quick scheme?
Is saving a buck on fees really worth supporting one of the most centralized coins ever created?
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:09:20
only bcash shill articles are reporting this
wanna know why?
because nobody in the real world gives a fuck
nobody is out there thinking, wow i would really use bitcoin to buy my bagel in the morning if it wasnt for those darn fees!
people are thinking, damn this shit keeps going up, it seems like a good investment opportunity
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:01:09
You keep saying “catastrophic” but nothing you’ve said sounds that bad
Sure it would decrease the hashpower at first.  But soon people would start making ASICS for the new pow. And guess what?  If jihan tried to monopolize the new PoW?  We change it again.

"The cryptokeynesians don’t realize their desire for money velocity dooms their altcoins to a subpar long term trend. They’ll be relying on pump and dumps for the majority of their gains. HODL always means less stacked up on the sell side, so bids easily push it higher." -Travis Steward

You have to understand that this battle is more of a propaganda and social engineering battle
If we look at just dev talent and technology core wins 100-0
But right now bcash is losing 18-82 approximately due to Roger vers propaganda campaigning
Here is the totality of bcash’s “tech”.  Steal bitcoins code - change blockweight max = 8mb.  Pretty amazing huh?
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:31:45

@_date: 2017-11-15 17:05:52
If you think we should be concerned then explain which coin can fill the gap? (Just giving you the benefit of the doubt and assuming there actually is a gap)
Litecoin is the only other coin with comparably advanced tech/devs.  And that’s because they literally copy everything bitcoin does
Every other coin for the most part is a piece of shit with no good devs

That’s incorrect because bcash does not follow the same consensus rules as bitcoin.  It can never become bitcoin same as if ethereum were priced higher than bitcoin it would not become bitcoin

Hey sorry about that other guy.  He’s a troll from rbtc.  You can tell because of his redditor for 2 day’s tag.  He’s trying to make our community look like assholes.  
If you plan to hold your bitcoin for a long time i recommend a hardware wallet like trezor or ledger nano
If you use an exchange like Gdax you can buy bitcoin with limit orders for 0 fees and then you can withdraw bitcoin to your wallet for 0 fee
If it’s a small $ amount that you’re investing it’s probably okay to just leave it on the exchange
Or you could look into making a paper wallet for long term cold storage

You are misunderstanding the miners role in the bitcoin equation
Their sole job is to mine blocks within the consensus rules

meanwhile vendors are drooling over bitcoin because it keeps going up in value and its the authentic rolex of crypto whereas bcash is the chinese knockoff

Sorry you’re having these problems man.  Right now is a crazy time because so many new people are signing up and Coinbase doesn’t have adequate people to deal with all the requests.  For me Coinbase took a few minutes to verify my ID however Gemini took several days.  Cex took over a week
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:41:22
The article was heavily slanted towards s2x
It portrayed s2x as good and progressive and pragmatic and it portrayed bitcoin as the opposite
It portrayed the failure of the hardfork as a failure for bitcoin as a whole 
All in all it was a piece of shit article

9 years of hard work - bitcoin
being pumped by the pump and dump crew (roger, jihan, craig) - bcash

will moon when it's listed on CME - bitcoin
building a decentralized and immutable base layer and adding more advanced layers on top of a solid foundation - bitcoin
built a centralized base layer and will just keep making that layer fatter and more centralized with no technological advancement - bcash

1). Read the article.  The Chinese mining CEOs tried to force a max blockweight increase against the majority wishes
2). It’s fucking weird don’t give me that shit. 80% fucking volume from 1 exchange.   80 fucking percent.  That is the complete opposite of legit organic growth. Also Coinbase is not the biggest western exchange

these bcash fuckers are literally trying to kill bitcoin.  do you have any idea how many people would lose huge amounts of money if that happened?
not only are they trying to kill bitcoin's monetary value but they are trying to replace it with a centralized chinese piece of shit coin, completely decimating the idea behind why bitcoin was created in the first place, and why many people love bitcoin in the first place

They are developers not public relations lol
Bitcoin is decentralized and therefore its PR firm is the community.  This Reddit is part of the PR firm which is why it is moderated
Andreas is the closest thing to an official spokesperson that bitcoin will ever get
Also the devs do tend to make posts here about new core releases or exciting new ideas
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:46:47
the blocksize doubling is completely irrelevant
this hard fork is to see if bitcoin can be controlled by CEOs with a small side-effort by jihan/roger to pump bcash
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:42:45
with paypal i can send anyone money instantly, with no fee
and they have buyer protection stuff so i cant get scammed online
with bcash i have to register at an exchange, give them my ssn and photo ID, register my bank/card, trade fiat for the specific amount of bcash that i want to transfer.  then dont even get me started on trying to find a vendor that will accept bcash (pretty much nowhere accepts bcash)

@_date: 2017-11-06 20:46:36
Ok I can’t do your fancy formatting because I’m on my phone and I don’t know how so I’ll just go down the list
Wrong, it’s an attempt to increase centralization and consolidate power 
It’s offensive that a bunch of ceos would make an agreement to control bitcoin because bitcoin was created to be uncontrollable
It is their motive because they said so themselves.  The objective is to kill the core chain and rebrand s2x as bitcoin 
Yes no replay protection is malicious because tons of stupid people will try to sell their s2x (altcoin) and may accidentally sell their bitcoin 
Hashpower does not dictate consensus in today’s world.  Mining is dangerously centralized.  If we allow a Chinese mining pool to dictate the future of bitcoin then the entire concept is a failure
Large amounts of hashrate is good for bitcoin.  The centralization of hashrate is terrible.

to paraphrase Peter Todd
ignorant people cannot distinguish between competent people (core devs) and charlatans (roger ver).  journalists make the problem worse by presenting the two sides as equally viable and the divide as a simple difference of opinion when in actuality the charlatan's point of view should not even be considered.

Shill does not imply payment.  And that’s what all shills say btw “I’m not being paid”.  Go look up shill in the dictionary
Also... who lost 2-3k?  Lol wtf.  I’m a bitcoin holder and I’m WAY up this year
We are only further away from the transaction solution because bitcoin devs are spending a shitload of time defending against attack by malicious altcoins like s2x and bcash
Here’s a thought.  If they want bitcoin to function optimally - STOP ATTACKING IT
It’s like that fucking Chinese scammer jihan pulls his hashpower off bitcoin and then says “oh wow look bitcoin so slow now. Buy my altcoin bcash it so fast wow!”
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:01:21
hey man sorry for not responding earlier, i was on my phone and didnt feel like typing the response on my phone
so about vitalik
i think this sub in general is becoming more and more disenchanted with vitalik as time goes on
he is a genius among geniuses for sure but i think he made some major mistakes with ethereum
first off its inflationary - i dont like that
second the architecture is too broad and the design teams are too segregated
this leads to them experiencing major bugs like every other week and this will never be fixed because its inherent in the basic design, the attack/flaw surface is too big
also lets remember that ethereum is a competitor to bitcoin so vitalik profits from the btc/bcash drama because many people are withdrawing from btc and moving into ethereum for the price stability
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:14:41
roger ver and jihan wu make a quick buck
the people who are thinking that it will become the new BTC are completely delusional and will end up losing a lot of money when roger and jihan dump on them

you are most certainly a shill
every one of your statements contains a presupposition that not only have you not proven but has been debunked repeatedly.  then when you shills come in and keep spamming these falsehoods and get your shit deleted you scream "censorship!  we didnt get to repeatedly scream our lies! censorship!"
its a really low attempt at rhetoric and only tards will fall for it.  you are basically just a slightly more mature version of when a kid asks his friend "do your parents know you're gay?"
furthermore your post history on r/btc betrays your motive

Make up the core foundation of bitcoin.  Functioning as a small scale payment network is a secondary function and is much less important to anyone with a working brain.  Also don’t worry.

Anyone can afford bitcoin.  You can buy fractions of bitcoin. 
Also just be careful with Bitcoin Cash.  It is NOT related to real bitcoin. 
Bitcoin Cash was created by two men named Roger Ver and Jihan Wu.  There is a glitch with their proof of work algorithm which allows Jihan (a Chinese mining mogul) to mine a TON of Bitcoin Cash very easily which is making him a tooon of money.  I don’t recommend you buy it.

What you’re not understanding is that if any other coin achieves the same adoption as bitcoin that it will have similar bottleneck problems

@_date: 2017-11-24 07:43:06
A pump and dump occurs in 4 phases
Phase 1.  The people in on the scam pump the price up by buying 
Phase 2.  Propaganda/shilling.  Induce FUD in the competitors and FOMO for the asset being pumped
Phase 3.  Wait until FOMO people have bought in which moves the price up
Phase 4.  Sell at a higher price to the FOMO people and leave the FOMO people holding the asset
This is working well for bcash because Roger Ver and Jihan Wu are quite wealthy and can move the price on their own.  And they have a lot of money to throw at marketing shills for phase 2
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:47:53
thats generally how a pump and dump works
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:34:55
It’s just basic economics that anything deflationary is difficult to be used as a means of exchange because demand will always be higher than supply

That’s the nature of a deflationary currency
In order for people to be willing to spend a currency the price has to be somewhat stable
The fact that bitcoin is growing my wealth is a lot cooler to me than the ability to buy a popsicle with it
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:37:44
EDA means emergency difficulty adjustment
so basically the jihan would mine the shit out of bcash, then the difficulty got tuned way up and he would stop completely
after a while of 0 mining the difficulty would turn way down and jihan would mine the shit out of it again
since the difficulty was tuned so low he was able to mine like 1 block per minute
if you look at the block height of both chains youll see that bcash is way ahead of bitcoin, and this is the reason why
the total mining rewards from that shit got jihan roughly 100k coins, which is at least 100mil at the current price
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:01:34
i think youve been reading r/btc too much
bcash is a pre-mined pump and dump scamcoin
roger and jihan are getting rich and anyone else who buys in is going to get hard fucked
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:22:04
probably cuz people like to make money and not lose money
oh wait i just checked your post history
youre a bcash troll and fudster
even though you're a piece of shit ill give you some advice - dump your bcash before roger/jihan dump on you first
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:57:12

What you’re saying is wrong though
A hard fork done without consensus can not become bitcoin
That’s the nature of a decentralized consensus ruleset
This is the same as if some day ethereum became more popular than bitcoin.  It would not become “the real bitcoin”
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:08:58

bitcoin and bcash use the same proof of work algorithm which means they compete for hashpower

the chinese could, theoretically, create a centralized altcoin which would use the same PoW algorithm as bitcoin and launch a huge marketing campaign through one of their western shills while simultaneously only selling their mining equipment for said altcoin
theoretically, they would then be able to use a strategically designed difficulty adjustment algorithm to incentivize other miners to mine their altcoin which would slow down the bitcoin network.  they would then use this temporary slowdown to sow massive amounts of FUD while simultaneously pumping their altcoin through a korean bitcoin exchange to make it seem like there was real consumer demand for their coin.
the end goal would be to steal some of bitcoin's market share through deception and manipulation.
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:36:07

Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork of bitcoin which uses the same PoW algorithm
It tried to supplant bitcoin by stealing hashpower combined with an intense propaganda campaign and a simultaneous pump by several whales including a lot of Chinese using a korean exchange (and probably Koreans too)
Combined with using the bitcoin brand name to gain unearned publicity it easy gained more market share than random alt coins

@_date: 2017-11-29 03:30:09


true, but it goes deeper than this.  its well known in the community that a few key players completely control bcash.  roger ver, one of the players calls it "my project" and "my product"


bitcoin's scaling plan is to use second layer solutions like lightning network.  it is calculated that for bitcoin to gain worldwide adoption the blocksize would need to be in the terabyte or even petabyte range, which makes running a node impossible for individual people (kills decentralization)


true, the most vocal proponents of bcash are old bitcoiners who started off with a huge amount of bcash and then sold their bitcoin to buy even more bcash - they have a huge economic incentive to shill it


not quite
first of all, they didn't completely remove segwit, they copy/pasted back in the signature signing/verification code from segwit (but youll never hear them mention this)
however, not having the full segwit code means that second layer solutions are impossible unless they implement code which does the exact same things that segwit does (but they will not call it segwit)
to make an analogy, bcash is stuck in the iron age while bitcoin is moving into the steel age.

I don’t think it’s about price targets it’s about market cap.

Market cap or price is an easy way to gauge this.

they are one piece of the system of checks and balances that is bitcoin and if that one piece can hijack it the system failed

That was my point...
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:17:15
Yea it’s sad lol.  Satoshi definitely didn’t anticipate that majority of hashpower would be controlled by just a few people.  
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:30:41
chain with most work =/= bitcoin
go read the white paper again

@_date: 2017-10-26 15:22:25
Do you consider bitcoin a failed concept considering a handful of chinese miners can now dictate changes at their whim
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:10:17
Chinese mining pools have agreed to mine s2x.  This would make it very difficult for the core chain to find blocks as the difficulty is adjusted for a hashrate that doesnt exist anymore.  If people see that the core chain isn’t producing blocks fast enough they may panic and sell
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:21:29
the majority of r/btc thinks he is satoshi
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:45:51
who woulda thought that miners would support a chain that gives them more power and control!!  whoaaaaa
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:01:38
whats a printed tether?
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:05:56
satoshi comes out of hiding and 51% attacks the network destroying it and bankrupting hella nerds everywhere
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:15:25
So how is the solution to that problem supporting a corporate funded takeover which has 1 dev who is simultaneously working on his own premined altcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-28 06:34:06
wrong.  that would allow a small chinese girl to completely control "the bitcoin ecosystem".  that aint what bitcoin is about homeboy

im not gay but $20 is $20
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:07:44
wrong again doofy
what youre describing means that ANYONE can fork btc and then if jihan wu mines that blockchain it will be the "new btc"
just think about it instead of repeating propaganda 
@_date: 2017-10-17 05:33:41
so youre saying its better to just take the hit and withdraw my 401k?
@_date: 2017-10-28 06:22:28
the miners are NOT the problem here
the problem is that coinbase and gemini made a backroom deal WITH the miners to re-brand s2x as btc
coinbase and gemini are the real fuckers in this situation
the chinese are just doing what anyone else would do in their position
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:01:27

Hope you’re right and they get wrecked
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:49:09
It’s so strange how people home and ask things like this before even attempting any research by themselves first
I don’t understand this mentality at all
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:41:28
Isn’t there a lot of risk because no replay protection?
@_date: 2017-10-29 07:04:47
i would think it depends on how the vendor's wallet is set up
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:14:01
the real question is.  will slow blocks even matter?
a ton of miners have been mining Bcash and slowing the BTC block speed as a result.  the price hasnt changed

@_date: 2017-10-25 17:05:00
1) no replay protection
2) trying to get your altcoin renamed as bitcoin
How is that not an attack?
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:38:58
what do you mean?  i was just assuming that a miner would only dedicate 80% of their hashpower to a chain if it had 4x value over the remaining 20%.  just simple math
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:16:41
pussy detected
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:38:32
the terminology on all of this is wrong tbh
this is a contentious hard fork which will create an altcoin that 80% of miners (chinese) have pledged to mine at the onset
the problem is that many exchanges have threatened to rename this altcoin as btc due to the hashpower switching  - something totally against everything btc stands for
a 51% attack is a different thing.  that's where &gt;50% of hashpower is exerted ON THE CURRENT CHAIN in order to create a fraudulent block - thats not whats happening here (a 51% attack is only possible on the current chain because nodes would reject the block as invalid otherwise)
@_date: 2017-10-28 06:39:20
if said small chinese girl happens to control the largest mining operation on the planet she will be able to solely influence which chain has the greatest proof of work
if people like you then declare that chain as "bitcoin" it will cause a feedback cycle wherein money and other miners will switch to the impostor chain and the 51% attack will have been executed successfully 
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:44:19
youre very very confused
with your logic any random altcoin like litecoin or vertcoin can be renamed btc if it gains majority POW
really just read the white paper again and stop posting incorrect info
@_date: 2017-10-29 08:24:09
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:09:12
You absolutely are either ignorant or purposefully slinging harmful rhetoric
You try to paint this situation as a mere disagreement rather than what it really is: a hostile takeover

@_date: 2017-10-29 16:17:05
I don’t have a tv. 
But you people need to realize that the majority populace doesn’t operate based on facts and logic.  They operate based on perception and emotion.  
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:48:36
That’s obvious.  But you’re missing the part where Coinbase and Gemini are already bought out.  They are just doing their best to appear impartial when they aren’t. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:42:08
Any article that tries to be neutral is bad imo.  Anyone who would advocate turning the control of bitcoin over to corporate interests in exchange for lower transactions fees is a piece of shit. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:29:06
oh sorry sir...
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:49:44
Wouldn’t that imply s2x has 4x the market cap of btc?

I like how you are on reddit for one week and you make a new thread “tell me which crypto I should buy that isn’t bitcoin because I missed the bitcoin train but I still want to get rich quick”. Then when people make suggestions you demand “explain”
You’re lucky people around here are excessively nice kiddo
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:43:35
Right.  And tell me again what happens when most of the hashpower falls off the grid?

I think you’re lying about searching for this answer.  On the front page of this subreddit there are several posts about different btc communities opposing s2x.  (Brazilian French Hong Kong i think they were)
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:11:28
Uh huh.  You’re actually so delusional to believe that miners “work to secure the chain”
Miners mine for money and the chain security is byproduct (from their point of view)
That’s the game theory behind bitcoin 
Miners don’t give a shit about “bitcoin”.  They care about money.  If they think this forked altcoin is more profitable in the long term then they will mine that
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:26:51
Welp.  Sounds like the community is a disaster
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:17:25

Hopefully someone else will explain it for you since you seem to be too lazy to do research
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:28:49
It’s not about brutality.  It’s about you being rude.  You come in here as a new person.  And instead of chilling and doing some research you immediately start demanding info from other people.  You demand and demand while offering nothing in return. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:50:42
The problem is you’re ignorant. Here is how the discussion went:
Miners: we want bigger blocks
Core: no because that would decrease the amount of people able to run full nodes and therefore increase centralization, you know like the very thing bitcoin was created to oppose. There has to be another solution
Miners: grrr
Bankers: hey miners. We can create an alt coin that we have more control over to do what you want.  All you have to do is devote your hashpower to it.  Don’t worry we already bought out the largest exchanges so they will support it
Miners: chaching! $$
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:45:42
Ok I’ll repeat...  they don’t get dollars.  They get the new coins
If they sell them then someone has to buy them 
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:05:52
when you withdraw 6k you have already sold your bitcoin to another person who bought it for 6k
why is that weird?
the price is based on people buying/selling, not magic

The essence of bitcoin is its decentralized uncontrollable nature.  That’s the only thing that differentiates it from a central banking system.  Segwit2X is an attempt by a few wealthy people to completely hijack bitcoin and everything it stands for and consolidate power in their hands.  Any portrayal that differs from describing it as a malicious attack is propaganda and rhetoric. 
There literally is no “fair and balanced” view on this issue.  This is freedom versus slavery. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:53:20
Why is it not a problem
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:36:05
Yes it could be an imposter.  But if the imposter succeeds it will cripple the current chain. There can be only one 
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:04:23

@_date: 2017-10-28 07:05:25
coinbase already claimed they will rebrand bitcoin after 48 hours
im pretty sure the little chinese girl can afford to mine at a loss for that long, considering how rich bitcoin has already made her
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:04:54
Segwit1x was done with consensus (what bitcoin is all about)
Segwit2X is being forced on the community by corporations and miners signing an agreement behind closed doors
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:47:29
they will probably join in because of the game theory that bitcoin was designed with.  everyone achieves the greatest benefit by joining in and playing by the rules
@_date: 2017-10-26 06:49:33
Yes let’s hear the same arguments repeated again and again from 7 day old reddit account banker shills as they try to destroy one of the coolest things I’ve seen in my lifetime (since you’re old I supposed I should specify that I’m using sarcasm here)
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:49:57
youre right.  its wrong and it 100% violates the whitepaper but the exchanges have been paid off
cest la vie
but just know... just because a couple of exchanges call something btc doesnt mean it actually is btc.
i recommend getting out of the crooked exchanges before the fork
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:04:52
forgive me if im not understanding but i think youre cconfusing "economic majority" with "computing power"
i dont think that the majority populace has the same computing power at their disposal as the huge corporations with supercomputers

Is the no replay protection going to fuck people if they try to sell their s2x on gdax?
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:59:42
How do we dump a hard forked chain with no replay protection?  They made it this way for a reason
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:21:52

@_date: 2017-10-29 15:46:18
Youre getting confused. What you’re describing is only in the case of two identical chains. 
As was previously said.  If an alt coin like s2x achieves greater PoW it does not become bitcoin.  That’s like saying litecoin can become bitcoin.  Or ethereum can become bitcoin.
