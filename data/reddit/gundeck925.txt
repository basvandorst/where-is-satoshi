I'm sorry bro.. thats exactly what I was trying to avoid. Only my invoice was for $265 :-/
Thanks for the bitinstant deposit status update/ link.
Keep us updated on your transaction.

Wait... you did what?!?!
I just did a BitInstant order 90 minutes ago... Are you telling me that it's going to just sit there for 2~3 weeks until your server is back up?
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:27:55
Yes that's exactly what I meant. Thank you very much.

It's the same link as the other Zimbabwe link, but the story has been updated to official.

Fuck! I had my BitInstant invoice printed right before the freeze... I'm still a n00b so my accounts wont receive the funding from my bank until Tuesday so I'm SOL

Q: I am about to make a purchase through BitInstant... Will it only go through MtGox or can I have it go through BTCe? MtGox froze at $120 while BTCe is lingering at $60... Will my BitInstant transaction be suspended along with MtGox and processed at $120 when it opens?

Can you unlock my account?

Nice!! I decided to wait and see what the market and gox exchange were going to be like when gox resumed trading. my bitinstant voucher is good until tuesday morning and i dont have a car ATM, so it might be a while. as long as I can buy in under $130 I will break even.... but damn man I should have just taken the ride when I had the chance and got that $80 rate like you.

At what exchange rate did yours clear? How long was the delay?

he's more of a lurker... if that... i got him to make a reddit account a few weeks ago and he got me savvy in the world of cryptocoins, especially trading strategy. i'd probably be broke and bitcoin bitter if it wasnt for him!
