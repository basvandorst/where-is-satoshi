[You say bitcoin isn't good at transferring value?](

No effing way, he took the money and ran? Who would do that??

Remember when bitcoin24 went down permanently this year for being totally mismanaged? Remember when instawallet was hacked earlier this year and shut down their service for having terrible security?
Incompetent business fail *all the time,* especially in bitcoin.  It will have some effect on the overall economy yes, but it doesn't necessarily spell disaster for the whole group, business will simply shift elsewhere.

Just out of curiosity, was your account with them brand new or old?  My account was flagged once when I was new but I've never had a problem since being whitelisted

I would show people how their fiat wealth is declining over time.  
Pick your average investor target audience, show a bunch of memorable events from 1980's and say;


Something along the lines of 'Stop taking inflation for granted  Not every currency is designed to lose its value.  Bitcoin is a currency that fights inflation.'  Etc etc.  
You could go on to show a simple explanation of how the total supply of bitcoin is limited, giving it huge potential value (and indeed some of that effect has already been seen in the past 4 years)

If it incites a useful discussion on the perks/drawbacks of bitcoin then I'm all for it.  Your upvote/downvote arrows are the only thing you need to determine if it deserves more attention or not.  And speaking of attention, it looks like people are pretty decisive when it comes to putting you in your place.

My methods of gaining BTC are controversial.  
I trade BTC in an effort to stabilize the markets.  When the price is crashing I buy BTC.  When the price is shooting up I sell (sometimes, not always).  This is more difficult than it seems, as you have to gut-check yourself and correctly guess how other people are thinking.  
It's people like me who make sure that your BTC value doesn't look like a bucking bronco.  But in general I am a BTC bull, and want to see the value go up in the long term.  
Fun fact: the mining community is currently getting royally pissed off by their low returns and increasing difficulty.  This is good news for BTC, as over time people looking to invest will simply buy the currency outright instead of equipment that quickly loses its value.  More demand, higher price, and the cycle will start over again.

There are similarities, but Coinbase is not an exchange like bitstamp, you do not actually store USD there.  It acts more like a wallet service where you can also incidentally buy and sell USD by connecting your bank (for a 1% fee) 
Bistamp is where you can send USD funds to instantly convert back and forth from USD to BTC, on a very quick basis if you choose to do so.  (hence lower fees) 
That being said, it's sometimes still pretty easy to just butywith Coinbase.  Try wiring USD funds into an exchange and see how many fees are taken out.

Transaction fees at that point will carry a substantial reward with each block found.  There will always be an incentive to mine.

* 0.01 BTC = Bitcent
* 0.1 BTC = no real word I know of, either 10 bitcents or 100 millibits (mBTC)

side note, if the idea garners support here we could say something along the lines of "members of will be tipping the highest rated comment when the post is X hours old"  
To be honest 12 hours is quite a long time to wait and the post would be dead by then so no one would see the tips.  You might want to aim for 5 hours.

If you're ever curious about the hot topics occurring in the bitcointalk community, check out 
One of the big threads going on there for pretty much the whole of summer is about everyone complaining about the withdrawal delays:

The title of this article annoyed the crap out of me.  
Is bitcoin a currency? This redditor says yes
@_date: 2013-09-12 18:25:45
BTC might very well jump if people are willing to spend 17 mil on mining equipment.

If you truly known nothing about bitcoins, this is the kind of undertaking that is best left in the hands of a very trusted friend. 
The coins could be located on the computer in a kind of program that acts as a wallet.  It might be called bitcoin-qt, multibit, armory, electrum or something else.  
The coins also might be on a web wallet like blockchain.info, coinbase, bitpay, or others
The coins might also be on an internet exchange like bitstamp, mtgox, campbx, btc-e, or others. 
The coins might also be on a bitcoin mining site like 50btc, BTCguild, deepbit, slush, eligius, or others.  
The coins might also be in a smartphone app if he had one
The coins might also be tucked away on a paper wallet, which can look like any number of documents but essentially might be a long string of random looking numbers and letters. 
Case in point, if nearly any of these services require passwords and usernames that aren't written down, it is unlikely you will be able to get into them.  
I am very sorry for your loss, but it is unfortunate that if he passed away without leaving any kind of instructions or will then his investments are likely gone for good, UNLESS someone can figure out where they are kept and the password can be brute forced. 
I have given my girlfriend explicit instructions on how to retrieve/spend/sell my coins in the event of my incapacitation.  I'd encourage anyone here to set up a contingency plan too!

Once someone sends you bitcoin, they are yours.  There is no way for them to yank it back.  
@_date: 2013-09-12 18:30:51
I have no dog in this fight, but the zerocoin utility for bitcoin should make this very interesting. How can you tax what you cannot trace? 
@_date: 2013-09-18 19:51:06
You could ask them which law or company policy they are referring to that defines bitcoin as an age restricted product. 
@_date: 2013-09-17 18:51:01
When you make a purchase with coinbase, they will just deduct however much you bought from your bank account.  The BTC will arrive a few days later and you will see it show up in your coinbase account, able to be sent anywhere you please. 
If you become a level 2 verified user (basically have an account for 1 month, and answer a few questions only you should know) Then you can buy up to 10 BTC instantly each day. 
@_date: 2013-09-12 18:27:58
Consider yourself lucky then, just use whatever spare income you please to buy BTC instead. If it goes up, great! If not, well you only invested what you could spare. 
@_date: 2013-09-25 01:34:29
Pretty crass, but it made me laugh.  I just think most people who have a problem with MtGox choose not to use 'em.  If they can't fix their withdrawal problem then they'll die sooner or later. 
@_date: 2013-09-17 21:47:33
This doesn't quite have the universal appeal that I would be looking for.  It's neat, and it definitely goes after your typical  occupy wallstreet protester, but that movement has fizzled a bit because not everyone was on board.
For me personally, one of the biggest draws of bitcoin was its stance against inflation.  I didn't like the fact that over time my money was becoming worth less and less, and I had no say in it.  Once I learned about the 21 million limit and the steps I could take to be secure, I was in.

I'm at least happy that the Gov is meeting with big names in bitcoin.  If I read correctly, they're basically going to discuss ways to stamp out illegal activity without using broad and harmful laws that discourage growth and legitimate businesses.

Haven't they responded to reddit threads before? I'll try to look for an example
@_date: 2013-09-17 17:49:03
If you feel comfortable with your cryptocurrency wisdom, you should offer yourself as a source to help answer questions that they might have!

You know what scares me?  It's theoretically possible for all or nearly all of the miners out there to be unable to meet ROI at once, when the companies that sold them the equipment are just rolling in the dough
@_date: 2013-09-18 19:08:55
Whichever subreddit you post it in, make sure that it's on topic.  For instance, you could post in ask reddit and say something like, "Reddit, what's the best financial decision you've ever made? I'll be tipping the top comment 10m BTC ($14 USD) when this post is 12 hours old"
