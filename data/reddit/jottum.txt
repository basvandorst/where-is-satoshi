Throw me a measily 10 btc while you're at it. I'll keep oversight and make sure you do good for the better.

You trust the currency itself. That's the value. Dollars and euros are hard to print, and when done so it won't be long before you're caught.
Same with bitcoin. A network worth ~100bln is under constant attack. To my understanding it is still going strong, no-one has duplicated a bitcoin yet.
Why bitcoin is better: how many physical dollars are there? There is never going to be more then 21mln bitcoin. Fiat gets printed extra everyday.
Where are all those dollars, how many are printed? Only gov knows... For bitcoin, the ledger is transparant, every single one is accounted for.
