Thats correct! 
Yay! and I'm always glad to answer questions!

Just the airplant! The moss is planted. 
Yes exactly! Every few weeks just dunk it and let it sit about 30 minutes. It keeps the leaves plump and healthy!

Are you talking about the bitcoin icon or the add to cart icon?

I'm currently not shipping internationally, I'm sorry :(
@_date: 2014-02-15 15:41:01
Well I'll keep an eye out for your order :)
@_date: 2014-02-16 17:28:07
Thanks! 
I'll be shipping it out tomorrow morning :)

Hello! Check out my look book, there's photos of the terrariums beside my cat (a relatively normal sized cat). I have the sizes listed on the site as well! If you would like more scale reference, please email me at darby !

Hello! 
Yes, it should survive the trip to Illinois! 
As long as your package isn't sitting out in the snow all day I would expect it to fair quite well. The mosses I use are very cold hardy, but tillandsia like to be above freezing. I would probably need to give your box some extra insulation for warmth, but we could also work together to schedule your delivery at a time when you would be home. 
I would expect it to live quite some time when cared for properly. (Moss requires misting every few days, airplants like occasional water baths and sunlight!) 
You can also email me at darby with more questions! 
@_date: 2014-02-15 15:58:12
I agree! Maybe someday soon I'll figure that out.

Well we're only a few weeks old! We've just gotten started with our marketing campaign, but rest assured we'll be marketing more in the coming weeks. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 06:56:40
Oh no!  We'll investigate it.
@_date: 2014-01-27 00:09:33
The link should still be working! We didn't place the icon on the mobile view to keep the site simple. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 01:40:24
They just require a light misting every few days!
They are pretty easy to care for. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 15:56:57
I'm prepared! 
@_date: 2014-02-15 15:50:59
I'm using coinbase as my go-through, so I'll contact them and see if I can get that fixed! But if you are still interested I can accept BTC directly as well! 
@_date: 2014-02-15 05:53:07
I package the airplant separately but everything else is set up! 
They don't require a bunch of care. Some sunlight is important but your room should be fine! 
They just need some light misting, and the airplant will benefit from a short water bath every few weeks. 
@_date: 2014-02-15 15:52:11
Very true! As soon as I can figure out an efficient and safe way to ship internationally, you guys will be the first to know!
@_date: 2014-02-15 03:03:34
Thank you so much!

The look book is  book 
@_date: 2014-02-15 15:32:50
I wish! Unfortunately not.

Are you asking about shipping? I'm not currently shipping out of the u.s because I'm not certain about the process to ship plants outside of us soil.  Hopefully that could happen in the future!
