I also just bought at around 97 average yesterday, and then this immediately. Uhg.. Oh well going to grab some more at the low prices, just need to fund my account quickly while the discounts are on.

okay sort of figured it out. it is fairly confusing though that when you click once the price flashes and the check mark moves but the price stays the same until you click again. would definitely fix that.

I panicked and sold. But still made a decent profit on my 2 BTC so I'm happy.

Liberty bit does EMT deposits and withdrawals - low fees and volume. 
CaVirtex has a lot more volume but crazy fees and hassle deposits.

FUCK MY LIFE! 
Just got involved in recently, finally bought a few at 140 couple days ago. This has been a shitty ride so far.

Libertybit has the lowest fees of almost any exchange anywhere at 0.5% per transaction. Also the lowest barriers to entry with Email Money Transfers ($2 fee). 
The issue with them is that the volume is so low that the price often differs from major exchanges by around 2-5%. This doesn't always work against you though, as I have many times seen the price well below Gox or Virtex. 
Also if you see major swings happening on other exchanges and act quickly, Libertybit users often take their time to add/remove orders and there can be a lot of profit there as the price catches up.

I think I got about 0.015

Maybe, but a new silk road will pop up. In fact there already are alternatives running, and some suspect they are behind the recent attacks.

BAD IDEA! Try buying half that, or a quarter and you are still taking a huge risk. Price will likely go up, but we have no idea of the future of BTC.

When selecting the condition I am offer less for 'flawless' than for 'good' or 'broken'.

Awesome answer, thanks for the reply!

Hey there, just want to share my experience with Bitcoin. I was first introduced to the coin by a friend of mine that has been mining them since way back, and preaching about them non-stop for years. He owed me $5 from a lost Halo match, and opted to pay me in BTC. I figured why not give it a try and shut him up at the same time, then and there my fascination was sparked. I watched my ฿1 grow to over $260 then crash then boom then pow bang smash all in about 6 months. Best Halo win ever and what an awesome ride. Just a few weeks ago I bought a couple more coins on Libertybit.com using an email money transfer which was dead simple, required no verification, and took 24 hours. Very happy Bitcoiner here. Good luck with your project.

Not sure why you are getting slammed. Although your definition isn't textbook, I still feel where you are coming from. We desperately need to build a global society that works for the betterment of all people instead of just a small minority of the rich and powerful. We work more now then ever before, while at the same time our efficiency has skyrocketed. The incredible boost to worker productivity should have resulted in more leisure time, but instead we just had more work piled on us. Meanwhile the epic profits head up the ladder and lead to further widening of the gap between rich and poor.

Thanks yo, I am definitely planning on holding, as I'm in it for the long run and a few purchases down the line. I'm mostly kicking myself for not being more patient on my buy orders. I had them set up to catch any decent sized drops, I just didn't expect this. BTC is a crazy beast though, lesson learned.

I honestly would say in North America 90% of people haven't heard of it, or have only heard the word in passing on tv and not paid attention. Most of my friends haven't heard of it, and we are young and somewhat tech savvy. 
I should be getting paid or something for my work as a bitcoin spokesman for how much I talk about it lately. Today a friend greats me on the street with just "how much now?".

Libertybit has been trading below Virtex and MtGox for most of the last 24 hours. Plenty of good times to snipe some coin. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 07:24:22
Virtex has 600% higher fees than Libertybit (3% vs. 0.5%). Even though LB lacks the volume, with a bit of patience you will get better value. Afterwards you can take your coins elsewhere to trade or store, or you can stick around and build up the user base at LB.

How much did you have to pay for this sponsored post? 
@_date: 2013-04-15 08:09:57
Was it really? I love the Terminator movies. Well 1 &amp; 2 mostly. Maybe I shouldn't ruin it any more.

Thanks for the heads up. Hadn't heard of it. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 23:57:23
Libertybit FTW. Why pay x6 the fee at Virtex? More volume would be nice, but I can just be patient.
