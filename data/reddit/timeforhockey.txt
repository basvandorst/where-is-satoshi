Thanks. It seems Coinbase is one of the most popular ones here in the U.S. so maybe I'll just bite the bullet and link a bank account to try it out.

Sweet!  I play center in a B league and a C league here in Utah.  I'm not sure how Utah hockey stacks up with the rest of the world though... At least we have some cool rinks because of 2002.

Thanks for the great info!  I'm going to set up an account at Coinprism and play with it a bit.  I'm going to try to give you my first tip, so hopefully it works: 300 bits @_date: 2014-05-09 01:08:59
You still in the generous mood? I just started Bitcoining this evening and missed getting to your post in a timely manner.  Even if you're done, it's cool you want to and are able to do something like this.  I'm going to use it as an example to  my students as microtransactions.

Colored Coins could be use a rewards system from restaurants or other businesses.  In fact, I am a teacher and wanted to use Colored Coins for a rewards system in my business and computer classes.  Unfortunately, once I created the coin in Coinprism, I found out it costs about 5 cents per transaction.  At 190 students over the course of a semester, that is way too expensive.

Thanks! Do you play hockey?

Not capitalized? I thought it was a proper noun until it becomes synonymous with crypto-currency. Thanks for the heads up!

I didn't want the coin to be worth actual money, since it can get a bit dicey if a teacher is paying "real" money to students. I wanted it to be similar to other reward programs but using a "worthless" cryptocurrency that I would dispense within the class.  I haven't thought about a student hacking it - what could they do?

Maybe Rainman can...

Thanks for the clarification.

Which exchange do you use?  It seemed every one I looked up reviews for, there were people saying it was great and other saying it was a scam.

If I'm making a sandwich, it's gonna have miracle whip.  Hell, in Utah, you're lucky if it doesn't have ketchup too.

It just means "hold". You can look it up - it seemed to start from a typo.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:32:27
They have a "no return" policy and I haven't ever dealt with them before so... 
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:10:56
Thanks! They're a bit young for COD but we'll find some exciting game.
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:22:39
Yeah, although I have no clue about how yet. That is April Me's problem!

The old one? I was looking at the Playstation 4 Pro, thinking it would be "future proof" when we upgrade our TV one day. You have any advice?
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:19:28
I looked but couldn't find one. There were a couple of sites that had "no return" policies and that seemed like a red flag.
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:21:48
Yeah, that site must be blocked here. :)
