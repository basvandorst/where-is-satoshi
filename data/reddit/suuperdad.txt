Exactly, on it's current path, (personal opinion only - you have yours, this is mine) is that Bitcoin is an excellent vehicle for people get to their money into crypto, and then move into something else once they learn (painfully) how bad Bitcoin is at doing it's job.
The moment any actual useable coin approaches BTC (and XRP is making a move for it), then BTC poofs and goes the way of Dogecoin.
But crypto won't die. And that's what's important.
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:18:26
Then the price goes from 10k to 20k and you had a sell order at 12k and got bypassed.
Or you have a buy order right now at 18k and it falls down to 12k and you are stuck.
Guys, you can't predict the future. Every single strategy, every one, has weaknesses. Just hold until you want, sell when you are happy and walk away. Or just buy buy buy and trust that it is going to the moon. There's no other thing to do.
Or you can do what this person advocates, but that method GUARANTEES that any big climb you aren't part of. And it GUARANTEES that any steep fall you buy into then lose tons. The only time this works is when the market oscillates within the buy/sell ranges. The second it moves outside that range, you get burned hard - either way up or down burns you.

Now is a super important bag transfer period and could greatly shape the future. 
There were 3 massive dump attempts last night and every one got stuffed. If we have growth today we could be seeing the continuation of something that has been happening for a while... Korea, Japan and eastern EU trying to dump the market with sells, and western EU and North/south america buying and pumping it.
There could be massive global implications if crypto does this a bunch more times and recovers longterm.

This "feature" is literally going to extinct us. Nearly every major problem we face related to this "feature" is at existential threat level.
Yes economic pullback happens when you don't incentivize constant spending and speculating just to keep circulating happening. But we need economic pullback. We cannot keep consuming natural resources, and the carbon footprint that comes with that consumption.
The problem with Keynesian economics is that it isnt based at all on reality. We can't have constant growth on a finite planet. End stop.
We either fix this shit in the next decade or we die. Its survival at this point. Hell, some think its already too late, because putting a bunch of high heat capacity gases in the air is a process with high inertia and high latency, and we have already passed the tipping point.
This feature you mention may infact be the single thing that took out the human race. But man, it's great for spurring consumption and profits. Yay us. Decorating the planet as we kill it and ourselves.

The response to that dump attempt is extremely bullish.
And we're not going sideways, we are sawtoothing. We have constant steady growth, then one whale tries to keep us down and spikes it low, then we just buy up all their bags and keep marching. It's only a matter of time.
Think of what happens each time they dump like that. They market sell straight down through the buy orderbook, and fill hundreds of peoples bags, decentralizing their fat stack.
When the market stays limp afterwards, they can buy back most of it at the low price, and expand their stack. But when the market instantly responds by buying the dip, the person that market sold their stack will lose bigtime. If they want to replace their stack, they are now buying through the sell orderbook, but they are competing against everyone else doing the same thing buying the dip.
So they may have dumped 1000 BTC to cause the dump, but by the time the price reaches 4k again, they'll only have bought back 800 BTC for the same value they sold at. 
It's getting more and more dangerous to market sell, or short. 
The response to the spikes down over the last 2 weeks have been insanely bullish. All anyone that is market selling is doing right now, is filling the bags of thousands of holders that the new ground floor is built on.

The one thing they didnt have that we do now is that we are pushing resource, energy and environment boundaries way more than then. Back in 1970 you put 1 barrel of oil worth of energy and got 100 out. In 1980 it fell to about 30 to 1. In oil sands it's about 5 to 1. In fracking it's about 11 to 10. 
We've deforested so much of the planet that we are facing 55 years of topsoil remaining, and massive issues with carbon sequestering.
We have so much pollution in our oceans that we are acidifying them and causing phytoplankton collapse. They make most of the oxygen on the planet.
I think you are right looking back that 2008 was nothing and even the great recession was just average. However I still think the next big one is going to dwarf anything we've seen, simply because we are going to be FORCED into lower energy less consumption lifestyles.

No it literally is nothing but the sum of individual players opinions. 
Now their opinions can be based off many factors, one is utility.
Something is only worth what people think it's worth, so the moment people let fake news impact how they perceive their asset, the actual value of their asset changes. The net sum of all these individuals can cause price swings when nothing actually happened to change the fundamentals.

Actually what you are seeing is survivorship bias. The people still here are way more positive than all the people that left. I'd say 99% of the previous holders are already gone. Some of them remain and troll various subreddits just to make themselves feel better that they got off the train, and to convince themselves they didn't make a mistake.
I think right now the majority would say that it's the end of bitcoin. But you won't get that poll result by asking people here or in because you are only polling the "survivors".

Stock market is feeling like a major bubble now. Chad has been watching on the sidelines while Billy retires making more money than Chad did his whole life on wall street. Chad wants in the game.
Is it just a coincidence that just as the Wall Street bubble appears it may pop soon that now crypto tanks based on nothing but Weiss reports, Warren Buffet announcements, India ban, Korea ban followed by JK LOL from both?
If you were Chad and wanted to flip the tables and keep your wedgie powers on Billy, isn't convincing Billy to buy wall street and tanking crypto, so you can take Billy's $7 bill for $2 the way you would do it?
Maybe I'm nuts, but if I were Chad and I missed the boat, my master plan would look pretty much exactly like the last 2 months.
I'd be selling off portions (not all) of Wall Street and scare $7 autistics so I could steal their ground floor from under them. Not so I could be 100% in on $7 bills, but so that I could at least hedge against a crypto rise. Chad owning even 10% hedge bought on the floor is a lot better than the the 0% that he held in 2016.
Nah I'm probably nuts and Chad is totally okay letting the tables flip on him, and I do actually have autism from holding my crypto.

Yeah I'm not sure why are talking about fractional banking now.
Regarding pizzas, they have value because people believe they feed a man for a day. People believe that because it's true. But make no mistake that it's tied to the persons belief of that thing and not the actual fact of the matter.
If all of a sudden an erroneous study came out that pepperoni caused autism, then everyone but you may pay less for that pizza in fear of becoming autistic. It doesn't matter whether or not the pizza actually does cause autism.
The value of the oven isn't based on the fact that it can make 20 pizzas a day, its based on people's opinion that it will. If news reports come out about some pizza overnight electrical box failing at 1000 hours, whether or not it's true, people's perception of that oven will change and they will pay less for it, because they perceive it will produce less pizza in its lifetime.

My entire point in posting all this however is to let people know that Chad wants your ground floor, and FUD is exactly how he steals it from you. Everyone can decide if they are holding a tulip or if they are holding Amazon.

[I took the time to type out the answers]( if you are curious
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:02:39
Remember I'm not talking about bitcoin. I'm talking about assets in general.
In fact bitcoin may end up being the $10 valued $7 bill. Hell it may end up being a $50 $7 bill. It may be that etherium is the $1 $7 bill. Who knows? That's the fun part.
What I'm trying to express however is that what something is worth is entirely tied to the net sum of all opinions on it. Each time a fake report comes out about "India bans crypto" and is followed by "JK we aren't", seeds of doubt are placed in people's minds. 
And it never returns to zero. For example, XYZ coin is at $10. Fake news comes out, XYZ falls to $5. Author of fake news comes out and says "I was forced by pain of death to submit that article. It's entirely false. I'm not in protective custody and feel safe enough to tell you it was all a lie". Well, not everyone that heard News will hear News Some people that heard News  will tell others who won't hear News  Some people who hear both won't know what to believe and will be cautious of coin XYZ regardless. Compared to time = zero, more people are going to avoid Coin XYZ for absolutely no reason that has any real merit, but they will. Perception is reality and coin XYZ settles in at $8 until a new story changes the general consensus enough to overcome the damage that Fake FUD NEWS did.
That's just the way this works, and you bet your ass they all know it.
Everyone is being played by everyone, and if you think Chad and Fuckface don't want to take your ground floor $7 bills you are dead wrong.
How do they do it? By changing your perception of the value of what you hold so that they can buy it, and then change your perception of what they now hold, and make you buy back in and pump their ground floor position on it.
It doesn't need to be bitcoin, you can relate this to crypto in general. Play the long game and buy and hold what you think has legs. If that's bitcoin then hold bitcoin. If you think it's ETH then sell for more ETH. Just don't leave the game if you actually believe in it longterm, because once Chad has hobbled up your Autism coins and announces no autism research, you give Chad back all his wedgie powers.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:47:23
You are wrong, dead wrong. The only thing that determines an items value is what people decide it is worth. All starting money can leave the system and as long as someone believes your item has value and is willing to pay for it, your item has value.
The moment people let all this FUD impact how they actually value their holdings is the minute that they actually are worth less.
This is why FUD has such insanely strong power because if enough people believe it, the value of any asset can drop to zero without any money changing hands or any actual legitimate reason driving it.
@_date: 2018-12-12 18:54:04
It's simple, it's just 1/x, where X is the amount remaining after the decline.
So 25% fall? 25% fall means 3/4 remaining. It has to go 4/3 from here (1.33x).
50% fall. 50% remaining (1/2). It has to go 2/1 (2x).
80% fall. 20% remaining (1/5). It has to go 5/1, (5x).
However, that's only if you don't buy back in. What happens if you buy back in at lower numbers? Lets find out...
80% fall. Double up. Now have 1.2 remaining.  Now the formula isn't 1/x but it's 2/x, where x is how much you have at the bottom. Now you have to go 2/1.2, or 1.67x from the current price. So if you were an absolute moron and bought at the full peak ATH, and then double up your fiat investment today (say price of 3450). It only has to go up to around 5750 for you to break even. Not 19500. Big difference. 
That's the power of doubling up and buying the dip.
Want to be crazy and triple-up? You only need to get to 3/2.2. So you break even at 4705 (based on bottom price of 3450).
Now, I'm not being crazy and tripling up, but I am DCA back in, so that on the next runup, I have a stronger portion of the basement floor.

@_date: 2018-12-05 01:03:03
If everyone is calling for a 3k floor, will it ever hit 3k? People will try to jump in at 3500 to get in before the 3kers, because it will rebound hard. That's IF we havent already seen the bottom and we just get slow buy know from here. Then this guy here will be waiting for 2k forever or buying back in at 5k-6k. Just imagine how much money is waiting trying to time the floor right now. 
I don't think we will ever see 3k just in pure game theory.
An analogy is a known airdrop at a predetermined date in the future. Everyone buys in before others to get the most of the spike. Then, people sell BEFORE the airdrop, because they know it will crash after.  So it actually becomes the best play to not even get the airdrop, but sell before it.
The same thing, but opposite will happen at this estimated 3k floor.
@_date: 2018-12-12 18:44:55
But since we're essentially talking about the post-mania crashpoint, then even having a 80k post-crashpoint, we have the potential of seeling 5x that in the bubble mania phase portion. 
Again, that's only if the past repeats itself again.
@_date: 2018-12-13 00:35:55
Less than what is the current method, especially when you expand it out to the labour force that keeps it all afloat, their needs (offices, stationary, computers, etc).
I also think we need to move away from POW because energy and environmental concerns are only going to get more and more of an issue. BTC has the luxury of name brand right now, and that means they get to watch other solutions (POS, dPOS, acrylic graph, dbft, etc) and any that seem promising they could swap over and probably retain their market share. Who knows.
PoW is going to be a big deal in the future. It already is now, it's only going to be more concerning the longer we go.

But to survive on this planet we NEED an economic pullback towards less energy intensive lifestyles. It's either that or we destroy the planet.
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:11:41
I work in the industry as an engineer, with almost 20 years experience. Energy isn't infinite. Renewable sources either have large footprints or are prohibitively expensive, or have transmission issues (due to low energy density per footprint). 
They have a massive role to play, for sure, and hopefully more and more in the future, especially solar. Solar on every rooftop, car top, etc.
But to say its unlimited is very incorrect. 
We need more solar, and way more nuclear. We need broader reactors, and thorium salt reactors would be great, if we can get past the regulatory and engineering hurdles (molten salts).
However, most of what has driven human progress is cheap oil. Oil went from 100 barrels per barrel in, to 11 barrels per 10 barrels in. Fracking is looking to be a net loss in reality, and comes with massive issues of potentially catastrophic ground and water aquifer contamination.
Make no mistake, peak oil and the years after is going to be nasty, and it takes roughly a decade to get a nuke plant up, from EA assessments to public hearings to government acceptance, to finding a vendor, to finding manufacturers for long lead items like pressure vessels and nuclear grade boilers, etc. 
You can say you want a nuke plant, and it may take 10 to even 20 years before you see an electron out of it. Closer to the latter if you are one of the last countries placing orders and find you can't source and qualified pipe fitters, electricians, welders with nuclear certs, or procure the nuclear grade parts you need.
The next 30 plus years are going to be very interesting. The economic pullback helped a bit, but it wont hold demand back for long. Not when places like China or India go through their industrial revolutions.

Conversely, I can say with absolute certainty that without a deflationary currency the human race is FUCKING DONE FOR.
We are raping and pillaging the planet, causing irrepairable damage, and it's all exclusively because we are in this constant growth economy on a finite planet.
People always say this about BTC that it's a BAD THING that bitcoin will have people store and hold value. That the inflation of currency is a design feature, not a bug. It spurs the constant growth economic model that our world operates on.
One problem....
You fundamentally cannot have constant growth on a finite planet. Our current economic model, which is spured by our current financial model of inflation to spur spending and prevent hoarding is so fundamentally flawed that it has the potential to destroy our entire species. It's that fucking bad.
We're destroying our planet. What we NEED, what we absolutely 100% require as a species, to continue our existence on this planet, is a currency that INCENTIVISES people to stop being so consumeristic.
People won't hold it all. Why? Because people need to eat. They need shelter. They need transportation. They need fun. People spend on fun, while carring debt that they could pay off. They don't do the "optimal thing" which would be paying off all debt first. They spend because they need to. BTC won't change that.
People will still spend, because they will starve if they don't. Even if they get paid in BTC, if you told them BTC will 10x by next year, they will still spend, because they literally die if not. They will still go out to the movies because we still go to the movies when we have credit card debt (not me, but many do). People still have needs, they will still spend a deflationary currency.
What they may reduce however is compeletely wasteful, unbridled consumerism. Gasp, they may spend less at Christmas. We may try to be smarter about wasting money eating out unhealthy food. Heaven forbid, maybe people even start growing some of their own food in gardens, reducing the pressure on industrial agriculture which is destroying our planet.
This isn't a "bug" or problem with BTC. Humans NEED a deflationary currency. Like... or else we're absolutely fucked. Existential threat - level problem that this is solving. Now we just need a deflationary non PoW currency that is also eco friendly. We sort that shit out, and maybe we won't be extinct in 200 years.

I'm making a wildlife sanctuary food forest system. The project was initially funded with cryptocurrency earnings. I started a youtube channel to document the journey better, [CanadianPermacultureLegacy](
Basically the idea was to turn cryptocurrency into a carbon sequestration, greenhouse gas soaking, planet saving project. Get people on board with how we can fix the atmosphere by planting more trees. Rebuild bee population. Rebuilding oxygen depleted air before the phytoplankton collapse hits us. Rebuild soil before the soil loss epidemic (55 years left) hits us.
Imagine doing all that with cryptocurrency profits. The project started strong, stalled out and continued on personal funding. I've rebuilt the ground flood of my crypto position in the last few months. Ideally, I'm hoping that this can expand to the point where I can buy up damaged lands from abandoned gas stations, use fungal mycelia and other biological systems to rehab the soil, plant food for community forage, for bees, for animals. Little mini ecosystems of food scattered throughout cities.
Many places have these food forests already set up. I believe Oregon has a very successful one. I'm hoping to expand that out, as large and far as crypto will allow me. If that means only on my land because crypto evaporates, than so be it. But I agree, having money to change the world, THAT is a legacy I want to leave. I don't want moonlambos. I just want to save the planet, one peach tree at a time.

I'm as optimistic as the next guy, but the problem with this is that it assumes linear (on a log chart, i.e. constant exponential) growth.
The fundamental realities of this is that the market which BTC can capture isn't infinite. So it's fundamentally impossible that a linear adoption curve (or exponential on a log graph) will continue.
So the questions then become....
1. How much market cap can we capture.
2. What is the adoption curve (typically an S curve) and where are we on it?
Regarding  it's very possible that 2010 to now we were on the more exponential growth portion of the curve, so the graph looks great plotted on a log curve. So the main question is, are we above or below the inflection point? i.e. is the rate of change of the slope positive or negative?
Most of that depends on how high the ceiling is - i.e. what is the market cap we can realistically expect at T=infinity, which for our case would likely be somewhere around the end of our personal lifetimes. There may be a ceiling push-up effect if we as a race manage to exit the earth and become a galactic species, but we won't experience that. So our natural limit is likely the natural capactiy limit for commerce on the planet earth, and even that limit is likely dynamic, lowering as we mine the shit out of our planets resources. And that's all assuming that we capture 100% of the market.
So we are either still on the exponential growth portion, in which case your graph has reasonable potential to work out, at least in the short term.
Or we are past the inflection point, and we are following the upper portion of the S-shaped adoption curve, and your graph fundamentally breaks apart, because we will follow a shape closer to the root-of-x than the square-of-x.

You know bank notes also had no liquidity because people wouldn't accept them. They all showed up with shotguns to their local banks, demanding their gold back - only it wasn't there, because the banks had already loaned it all back out.
Bank notes later became currency that you think is liquid enough. Because trust was created, and quite frankly people got complacent. 
Watch what happens to fiat if there is signs of an economic downturn where everyone tries to withdraw their money at the same time. The current economic model pushes economic collapse down the road really well... but it's fundamentally flawed because it's created to spur a constant growth economic model on a planet with finite resources. 
It's not a question of IF we get collapse, but WHEN. It's innevitable because the entire system isn't based on the fundamental realities of the world we live in.
There's absolutely no reason why BTC won't one day be extremely liquid. It's already very liquid to be completely honest - if I wanted to pull 1M BTC out of the system, I probably wouldn't even budge the price, especially if I did it OTC. 
It's a nascent tech/currency, it's going to be volatile for a while, but it won't always be. Same with liquidity.

Look up COINXBT:SS on Stockholme exchange. You can also hold that in a retirment account.

FYI, that's how I took what you wrote. Maybe choose your words better, and don't use words like "stunt"? I mean, come on man, we're not all idiots, when you use a word like "stunt" you definitely meant a money grab scheme.

Also, I think we WILDLY overestimate how many people were actually "exposed" to BTC so far. On a recent Joe Rogan podcast (a guy who has been repeately hosted shows about crypto and is fairly knowledgable on the topic) asked what Ethereum was. 
Think about that. 
We are so freaking early still.
