Had a checking account for 27 years and never a single fee. You're doing it wrong. Anyone who has ever had a fee for a bank account is doing it wrong. You know what else is crazy?

Where the FUCK did you read that? I never said anything like that. I'm a supporter of bitcoin but not of the people who have blind faith in it. I like to consider myself a realist. 
As far as institutional activity goes, I'd say the interest is rising but the actual dollars invested is still at a very low amount. So I kind of half agree with you and half agree with OP. As far as what he said in regards to the money being spent on infrastructure, I would say I agree. Sites are focusing on security and liquidity in the post-Gox world, which is great, but there still needs to be many more btc transactions to really say we're getting anywhere. Sure, I can buy groceries in btc at Walmart through gyft, but is Walmart paying their suppliers in btc? All the sites that are suddenly taking btc, are they doing it because they want to cash in on a trend or because they believe in it? Are THEY paying their suppliers in btc? Highly doubtful. When we see a lot more btc only activity and not fiat to btc then btc back to fiat, I'll begin to believe. Right now, I'm more of a fan of the blockchain than btc itself.

Why should the government prosecute a guy for something he did when the whole idea of bitcoin is to have a currency outside government control? You either want regulation or you don't. Jailing someone is pretty strict regulation. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 21:07:13

While debit card fraud is a little more tedious to fix than credit card fraud because as you're pointing out, the funds come out of your account immediately, it's still not a big deal.

It's funny that people don't admit that at face value, a lot of it sounds exactly like a pump and dump.

It's pretty much exactly like the shit they say on Mad Money, but they actually have to disclose what Cramer owns.

@_date: 2014-05-22 19:48:32


Yeah, you're really not providing strong evidence here. I will agree with you on the blockchain; that is the single greatest component of btc and I definitely see something like the blockchain living on longer than btc itself.  


Currencies and exchange rates fluctuate. That's not abnormal. 


The United States of America will most definitely outlast BTC. Maybe not other cryptos, but btc most assuredly. The death of btc will come when people realize that sure, it's great that people are picking up, but btc conversion to fiat is still a a gigantic part of bitcoin business. You use fiat to buy btc, use btc to buy whatever from a vendor that accepts btc, who in turn convert it back to fiat to pay their suppliers and employees. 
Also, what about scenarios where btc could increase in value off of it's own merits and the market without relying on a collapse of USD? I.e. instead of the USD losing half it's value so btc doubles in price vs the USD, maybe the conversion rate just goes up because the market for btc expands and the btc market itself begins to price it higher. You don't need something bad to happen to USD for something good to happen to btc.

It doesn't seem entirely unreasonable that someone who doesn't know alllllllllll the ins and outs of BTC would think that way. I mean, the big proponents are who? Early investors right? And they want people to adopt BTC so....that their holdings increase in value, not necessarily that it's a revolutionary currency that can make their lives easier. A lot of people have a lot to gain by getting bitcoin to be more widely accepted.

Do you have examples? I've worked in finance/banking for the last 8 or so years and as far as I know, you can't do anything with just a routing number and account number. If you have the account holders name, you would be able to send funds to the account. Setting up a withdrawal of any kind requires more info than that.

I mean, I can tell by your post history you have a hard on for bitcoin and that's cool, but your posts are circlejerky to say the least and obviously no argument will convince you otherwise because you're, for lack of better words, fanatical.

@_date: 2013-12-05 03:06:53
I'm giving legitimate feedback. People are INVESTING in bitcoin. They are not USING bitcoin (and yes, I'm aware that btc Black Friday was a hit). Sure, some restaurants accept bitcoin. Are they paying their distributors with it? Are those distributors paying their workers wages in it? Are those workers going out and using those btc at btc only businesses? No, I'd wager they are not. The level of speculation and investment in bitcoin is at an all time high, but that is not indicative of the same level of adoption. If the price increases just because people are buying them and holding them, that's not growth. 
Why was my feedback not "legitimate"? Do you think everyone who disagrees is doing it just for the sake of disagreeing? I believe in the long term prospects, but some of you people in here need a reality check. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:50:14

You are grossly overestimating the price of a hit. For $2000 you can get a shitload of interest from the under 18 gang crowd. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:02:40
Having a plan and sticking to it works when you have a lot of control over the situation. That applies to shit like getting fit or becoming a good cook. With investing, you need to accept that you are not the smartest investor in the market, and you probably never will be. You need to be able to adapt to a changing marketplace and a changing outlook on what you're trading in. 
I've got an experiment you can check out that's almost perfect at illustrating my point. Are you into sports at all?

You're really, really, underestimating kids in the ghetto. Doesn't always work like that. Not saying it can't, but it usually doesn't. You know those seemingly 'random' murders that happen in all the big cities? The ones where the person wasn't robbed or raped or anything, but just got murdered over what appears to be nothing? Just sayin'. Also, the consensus seems to be that DPR was scammed and the murders in question never took place. That's also a big difference between a cheap effective hit and a 'clean' one that never actually happens. For your $2k that kid in the ghetto will get it done, not just send you a phony ass picture with no accompanying article/missing persons report.

Like I said, you should talk to a banker. There's really no way that should happen. Is it your first payroll check with a new employer? Also, I can see you did this at the ATM, which many times has hold-first instructions. The investment accounts I will assume are Wellstrade, which is not actually operated by the "bank" so that doesn't mean much to them. If you've got over $25k (I'm assuming you do because you have several investment accounts) in there you should qualify for the PMA package, which is the anti-poor-people account.

Yeah man, poor people account. It's almost like the kind you set up for kids but with more restrictions. These are for people who show up in a bank check system (Chexsystems i think it's called) for a variety of reasons. Little fuck ups like too many overdrafts, cashing bad checks, all the way up to suspicion of fraud will show up here. If you've fucked up in the past, they put you into one of these accounts that holds your checks  and imposes other transaction limits. After a few months of good bank behavior, you'll usually be asked by a teller if you want to upgrade to one of the better accounts.

Definitely, definitely agree with you on that. I don't think "instincts" should really come into play until you've had a long time to hone and refine these instincts. Just because you've been daytrading BTC for 6 months and "have seen this before" does not mean the results will be the same. You need to look at new situations as what they are; new situations. Patterns exist but do not always repeat themselves and you need to be mindful of that. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:12:46
Look man, your theory is that NSA cryptographers (specifically) created BTC. You went from "whoever created this had a deep understanding of cryptography," which, on it's own, is extremely possible, all the way to "NSA cryptographers." Pretty big leap to make if you ask me. Why does it have to be NSA cryptographers and not any other government agency or private entity? Because this is tin foil hat bullshit, that's why.

Sorry dude but did you read indictment pdf at all? The basis for the charges is basically in the middle where it's described the various ways in which the LR staff KNOWINGLY attempted to circumvent laws in a couple different countries. The authorities(and media) are simply saying that money laundering was possible through LR. However, what's more important than that is the fact they violated laws in a lot of countries by falsifying reports to regulators so it would appear they were in compliance with local laws.

Use of bitcoins only to have them turn into dollars again isn't actually useful for the adoption of the currency, as it merely tightens the hold that real money has on bitcoins. In order for them to be truly useful, this guy needs to take donations in bitcoins and pay his hosting fees to a host that accepts bitcoins, or buy some pizzas at a place that takes bitcoins and also uses them to buy their ingredients.

Of course you deny them, but the evidence on him is pretty substantial. If you can take a deal that doesn't involve snitching, it's something to consider. I'd probably rather keep the money and do the time so I have the money when I get out, but who knows if btc will even be in existence by that point. 
@_date: 2013-06-11 16:45:23


Can you miss the point more? I don't think that you can.

You dumb motherfucker

Remember guys: when bitcoin goes up, it's because it's gaining traction, but when it goes down, it isn't because it's losing traction. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:16:49
Ehh I'll take the lulz and you can keep being someone who thinks they believe in something but is actually keeping it down
@_date: 2013-05-30 18:18:50
Unlike most the people in this sub.

Or the far more likely scenario, which is that people act like assholes when you can't punch them in the face.

It's not like he was like I don't like this dude, go kill him. It is being described more as a thing of necessity in this case, and he still wasn't happy about it. I will never underestimate someone who is backed into a corner, doesn't matter how pacifistic their belief system "should" make them. You're saying that people don't have a change of plans under duress? Grow up. DPR wouldn't be the first guy to say one thing and do another.

You're providing the means to acquire something illegally. Without you, the others wouldn't know where to search. You think if you just "tell people where to find child pornography" that the FBI is really gonna take that as an excuse?

Please, tell me more.

They're called airplanes.

Why can't we talk about how bitcoin was at 250+ a few months ago and is under 140 now? I suppose it doesn't fit your narrative. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:52:21
HAHAHA CUZ BTC IS THE BEST RIGHT?

Your payroll check is on hold? Sounds like you need to talk to the banker. I worked at WFB for years and you either have the wrong account type (basically the "poor people" account that holds your shit because you've proven in the past that you do not know how to balance a checkbook) or you've had some other penalties recently that don't fit the pro-bitcoin narrative. 
@_date: 2013-07-18 21:51:47
It makes absolutely zero sense to negotiate in BTC. By the time you cashout your BTC to 12MM USD/EUROS, you would cause significant enough movement in the market to actually be shorting yourself on funds. Don't be naive. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 18:43:45
God damn dude I thought you might be kidding but now I'm pretty sure you're just stupid. 
@_date: 2013-10-03 18:04:05
Parallel construction implies that DPR didn't get caught doing some dumb shit, which is exactly what got him caught. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:47:02
And it could go to $100. Why are there never any discussions about this? 
@_date: 2013-10-07 15:05:58
There are so many fucking people commenting on this thread that have NOT READ THE INDICTMENT 
@_date: 2013-04-17 16:13:20


And I'm sure you've been wrong way more times, right? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:48:45


That's actually a really bad idea. Think about it, most people lose money gambling? Investing and gambling are the same thing, so let's say most people lose money investing too. This is them following their gut instincts. You're better off taking whatever idea you have and going the exact opposite. That, or go the opposite of the market. 
@_date: 2013-05-14 00:46:52
Isn't it more bitfloors fault for not recognizing this as a possibility and disclosing it? 
@_date: 2013-10-04 18:01:01
The idea of the government making up more charges is ludicrous considering he GAVE them the information they needed by being an idiot. No need to overexpose themselves. I know how the government can be, but you all need to take your blinders off (even though I'm sure that everyone thinks they're off already). 
@_date: 2013-07-05 19:45:19
"Bitcoin value has always grown exponentially over the longer term" are you fucking retarded? Do you not see what's wrong with that kind of statement? 
@_date: 2013-05-07 20:06:45
I'd be willing to bet the bulk of transaction volume is simply daytraders.

Why wouldn't he post it if he's the one trying to prove a point? 
@_date: 2013-10-26 19:05:29
Yeah, actually. Industrial uses for gold can drive the price too.

Have you even read the indictment? Murder aside, it gets QUITE a bit deeper for DPR.

Alright Mr. Hipster. You think the authorities weren't on that shit from the beginning? 
@_date: 2013-08-23 16:20:18
Maybe because you don't pay as much attention to financial news as you do bitcoin news???
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:08:45
Why does nobody address the fact that the current rise in price is pretty much solely attributed to speculators and not actual use? 
@_date: 2013-09-02 22:01:44
Who said you own bitcoins? The only thing that people should really be comparing bitcoin (and it's viability) to is another currency. USD, euros, whatever. 
Why would you compare an equity stake in a company to an emerging cryptocurrency? If all you wanted to accomplish in your comparison is saying that they used to be worth less than they are today, then...bravo, I guess. We could have made the same claim about stamps or baseball cards, but that still doesn't mean it's a good comparison.
As far as legitimacy goes, it would seem that in general, people here want bitcoins to be seen as a real currency. Something you can use not just to supplement your fiat , but as a full on replacement. The goal (at least, as far as I can tell) would be for one to be able to do a job and be paid in bitcoins, then go on to pay for rent and groceries with it. If people are only daytrading bitcoins but not actually using them for anything, the market stagnates and they'll be worthless. 
I personally don't care either way, but it's interesting to see how little people actually know when they're making these ridiculous comparisons.

Don't think you know how little power the bank manager actually has. They're more service people than anything else. They would not get any advance warning about your account, nor would they have any power to stop higher ups from closing it.

It's still a big problem if they're sending the money on SR and the retailer is cashing it out in dollars or euros.

Stop. Just stop. You will not be a good advocate for bitcoins when the only suggestions people seem to have are Silk Road related or tax-evasion related. For this to really gain some steam there need to be more LEGITIMATE uses for it. 
@_date: 2013-05-31 19:46:12
Systems cannot be sociopathic. Why would you assume that just because I have criminal convictions, that I should be on your side? I've got some DUIs and I was a drug dealer for a while. If anything, the system has worked in my favor because I'm still free right now.

Alright, check it out. Take a sport you like and feel pretty knowledgeable about. Go to an odds site like vegasinsider.com and check out the odds on your sport of choice. Look at all the games happening today, and pick the team you think will win based off your instincts and experience with the game. Keep track of the picks and look at the results tonight. Most people will find that if they had gone opposite their instincts, they might have made some money. If not, see if you can do it a couple days in a row. If you've got good picks a few days running PM me ;)

No, you're saying that ANY usage of bitcoins is good. I'm saying it's only good if they stay in bitcoins, not cash out for "inferior" fiat-currency.
