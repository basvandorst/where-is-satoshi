Ratings assess risk. You can't argue that crypto is young, speculative, and extremely volatile. That puts it at a very high risk relative to most other investments - although also higher potential returns.

CME futures expire on the 26th. Bears buy up bitcoin to hedge, then dump it when they're looking to lose out. That's what I reckon based on the previous dip anyway, which matched the CBOE futures perfectly.

It's a new asset class, with bitcoin the defacto exchange currency for other cryptos. It has the largest market cap and the greatest (growing) institutional support. Crypto is here to stay - the technology is too disruptive not to be. For the medium term I see bitcoin remaining the crypto flagship. Primacy counts for a lot. Whether bitcoin will end up as the AOL or the Google of the crypto space, the verdict's still out on that one (but the lightning network is encouraging). As for final, stable price (if it gets there), who's to say... If you believe bitcoin has the potential to replace gold as a store of value, then that would put it at about $500k/bitcon. That's ambitious but not impossible (just very speculative). Personally, I think it's very reasonable to assume bitcoin in the near term will reach about 10% the size of the gold market, so $50k - it really depends what other cryptos do from there.

Coinbase are insured so so long as you trust them not to do an Enron and you keep your login safe it's not as dangerous as many people say; it's certainly one of the safest exchanges... the problem with stop orders is people deliberately drive down prices to trigger them and buy up bitcoin cheaply from the people who have them set; you're also exposed to flash crashes. You're better to react to an emergent situation yourself; get blockfolio on your phone and set price alerts.

Because it was a fork so everyone got a load of it which instantly created a market.

Or if you're European and in the UK you can occasionally get lucky and get free SEPA transfers from your bank (after the bank's euro conversion—assuming that's not just a big hidden fee), or a number of people here have suggested Revolut as a great way to get free GBP to EUR transfers (I've not used it myself though so just relaying information).

It does, and bitcoin is bad too for anything but as a store of value (for which its current market cap and support make it better than BCH). The difference is the lightning network is coming to bitcoin. BCH just has the road map of graphene, 1GB blocks, and spreading FUD and misinformation about BTC... They seem to think the way towards a transactional currency is creating something that takes several minutes to process whilst being only a bit less centralised than visa and with fees only several times higher than zcash.

'This is no investment advice, but sell you kids and buy bitcoin!' I'll be honest though, I sort of do this with my friends; I never tell them explicitly to buy crypto, I just tell them I'm invested in bitcoin for the long term, I strongly believe in it, and I think even investing now is going to make people huge returns in the long term... BUT there are risks, they 'could' (not that I believe they will) lose all their money, and they have to work out for themselves if they're comfortable with that exposure.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:56:42

It's should be noted that he didn't just put 50% of his investors money into bitcoin; he put 10%. The value of bitcoin has grown so much though that it's now worth 50% of the entire fund. He said he's now looking at ways of diversifying to reduce exposure without selling the bitcoin... I've no idea what this means sort of also shorting it. Also whilst the fund hasn't bought any other crypto he said there's an ICO next month that interests him (the only one so far that has), but wouldn't say which one (for obvious reasons).

Why is gold the defacto store of value? Yes, it's 'just a brand' in that sense and things might change. For now, it's the most attractive option though. Primacy has knock on effects (like the greatest market cap) - that's why it's attractive right now, not the direct fact that it was the first.

Sure. RTXP, the ripple protocol, allows for financial transactions in pretty much any currency, not just XRP. XRP just happens to be a cryptocurrency they built ontop that can also work through ripple. I'm not sure if I were a bank that needed to send $100 million, say, to some other bank, why I'd convert it to XRP, send it over ripple, and then convert it back to dollars, instead of just sending the dollar amount directly over ripple. I'm presumably missing something, but I don't understand the need for XRP, since RTXP itself doesn't require it.

They're basically all scams. There are a few places, like nice hash, that let you buy hashpower off of miners, but if you do that it's at a rate the miners selling the hashpower believe will be more profitable to them than just mining for themselves, so most of the time you'll still lose money. You essentially have three options with bitcoin - just take the money you were going to use buying cloud mining, and buy more bitcoin. Buy an asic or asics and mine bitcoin yourself. GPU mine other coins and convert them to bitcoin.

I'm super bullish on bitcoin, but I can't agree with the advice of getting involved with things you don't understand (at least in any way that'd be harmful to you if it backfires). I think anyone investing should really understand what they're investing in; else you get these big sell offs, like we've just had, where the people panicking and losing money are likely the ones who don't understand their investment.

I'm not sure how incentivized its users will be to convert from fiat or (say) bitcoin to xrp, and then back again for transactions when it's not needed. I'm sure the ripple protocol is going places, I'm just not so sold on xrp.

Good post. The most succinct way I've heard this expressed (I forget by whom) to encompass the whole of crypto (so smart contracts etc. too) is that a technology becomes disruptive via minimising cognitive burden. In this regard crypto is no different to deep learning, quantum computers, or any other revolutionary technology that's beginning to come into focus; it performs commonly required actions unquestionably more efficiently than anything before it.

Bitcoin would have to grow x50 to be the same size as gold. That might happen, it might not, but it illustrates that the potential for a lot of growth is still very much there. Ultimately I see the current crypto market like the dotcom bubble. Most coins that exist currently will die out, but the ones that remain (the Google or Amazon) will be worth a lot more than anything currently. What you invest your money in though is really a personal decision. I would do some reading about the different coins and see if you really believe in any of them on a fundamental 'this technology is groundbreaking and definitely has a future' kind of way rather than a 'this currency just doubled in value, if I put my money in it maybe it'll double again' kind of way. That's what you should be investing in. Remember to also take into account things like market cap and supply when valuing an asset (e.g. Bitcoin has a total supply of 21 million, ethereum's supply increases by a set amount every year - it does a lot more technologically, but is not such a good store of value for this reason). You can also always spread your investment around.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:02:47
Just in case you're not aware (because many people aren't), you can buy fractions of a bitcoin, you don't have to buy a whole one, so you can actually invest as little as you want. Of course the typical advice of not investing anything you can't afford to lose still applies.

It depends what country you're in, but your best option is to set up a coinbase/gdax account. Bank transfer money to your coinbase account and then buy through gdax (not coinbase as you pay a premium there). Coinbase and gdax are the same company so the accounts are linked.

Exchanges like GDAX and Bittrex are legally obliged to perform KYC and AML checks, as well as the route cause of the insider trading (if we're talking about the GDAX case specifically) being entirely GDAX's fault (through incompetence if they're not actually guilty). It might not necessarily be possible to recover funds once insider trading takes places, but both prevention and identification of individuals involved is (again, in this specific circumstance). Also, Binance still has owners, and they're subject to the laws in which their company is registered and site is hosted (they even moved country because of this); once their DEX is set up things might change to some degree, but this is really an unknown at this stage.

Other than the fact that they are the ones most able to do it and the timeline of when the spam was happening more/less was coinciding with BCH events/announcements (particularly from Ver), it's circumstantial, sure, but ask yourself who would be most motivated to carry out such an attack? They've made it their modus operandi to sell BCH by trashing BTC, instead of on its own virtues, and they control a lot of BTC and hash power.


If you take an extreme libertarian view, perhaps. But within the current exchange space, where most of it is regulated, moves like the pre-GDAX BCH trading were clearly wrong in most people's eyes, and preventable. Bitcoin may have emerged on a wave of libertarian ideals, but with crypto now more popular than ever, that's no longer the case.

Are card payments less relevant to you if you don't own a visa server? Is gold irrelevant if you can transfer your dollars into it, but can't mine it profitably from home? Mining maintains the ledger, thus allows the network to continue running. For now miners are incentivized with new bitcoin for their work, although eventually this will switch to just earning transaction fees; the difficulty of doing this adjusts to account for the number of people mining. Bitcoin is cryptographically secure, and other than earning money for processing transactions via donated computing power, it doesn't give up any control of the network to miners; there's such a thing as a 51% attack, where certain manipulations can happen if one individual controlled over half of all mining power, but the amount of money required to do so deincentivizes anyone from aiming for this as a loss of confidence in the network due to such an event would vastly decrease their investment's value.
The advantage of bitcoin is it's a completely decentralised, electronic value. You have control over all your money and no bank going bust, country ceasing to exist etc. can take that from you. You can also transfer it to anyone across the world or receive money from anyone without having to rely on layers of trust such as eskrow, or even trusting the individual you're transacting with.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:52:57
Coinbase always freezes during heavy activity - it's a crap exchange for reactionary trading.
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:57:50
The secret is that 90% of traders lose money. Investing is different to trading though. If you get knowledgeable on something and believe in it, you buy in and then sit on it because you believe in the long term and what happens in the meantime is irrelevant. If you want to trade and make money, you need to be really up on the news and drawing links between different events (so that you can buy or sell on information other people don't have). You also need to set stops (for cutting your losses) ahead of time and never trade on emotion. Most trading is happening through algorithms that are much faster (and better) than humans, and will generally be backed by far more money than you are (such that they can influence the market) - they will take your money if you try to react to developing situations.
That said, plenty of trends are pretty predictable when talking about big news, like segwit2x recently; people wanted free coins so were selling off alt coins to buy into bitcoin ready for the fork (so the price pretty predictably continued to rise). The second the fork happened there was going to be a big sell off back into alts, since people then had their free coins; as happened with the last two forks. Since segwit2x got cancelled the sell off just happened about a week ahead of schedule the second that news broke.
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:44:00
If you believe that have you cashed out then? Majority view right now, backed up by all the new institutional investment, is that it's got a long way to go. There'll always be contrarians, and they might be right, but it just seems like a funny time to trade for something that'll only ever depreciate (e.g. a truck).

@_date: 2017-11-01 12:52:13
If you believe in the long term future of bitcoin, buy before the fork - you won't lose your bitcoin once it happens. If it works like bitcoin cash and gold, you will get the same number of bitcoin in the new currency (although you'd have to transfer from electrum to recieve them). Obviously all uncertainty can make the price go down as well as up, and there's definitely uncertainty around segwit2x, but no one knows what the future holds so to reiterate, if you really believe in bitcoin, buy now - there's a lot of promise on the horizon; especially with the CME announcement. That said, only ever invest what you're willing to lose.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:17:08
No worries.
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:14:46
Depends. If you've not been paying attention, maybe not. If you've worked out a price to buy at in advance, then I don't see the issue. I generally tell friends that want to invest to just buy in though and forget about it.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:59:41
You're welcome. Yeah, I think it's pretty easy to forget that most of the world have far less financial security than us in the West. When your currency devalues by 30% each week, or you could lose everything just by speaking to an official the wrong way, the value of cryptocurrencies become far more apparent. Of course this is just scratching the surface; Bitcoin is one of the least sophisticated cryptos, although with the addition of the lightning network in the future it'll allow for instant, fee-less transactions, which is obviously a benefit to both consumers and retailers---even those who have absolute faith in their current money. Extensions, like Etherium's smart contracts, make this space even more exciting though.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:45:17

@_date: 2017-11-03 20:29:10
I wish I had that crystal ball! What I think is going to happen (obviously there'll be more information closer to the time):
The huge (completely unsustainable) growth we've been having over the last few days since the CME announcement has stagnated a bit today and looks like we may have hit a peak... I wouldn't be surprised if we get a decent drop over the next few days (but obviously if I could call it with certainty I'd 1. Be rich, 2. Be keeping it to myself).
As segwit2x gets closer (that could be now, that could---more likely---be within a week of the fork date) we'll most likely see a growth spike again as many people buy in to get the free B2X coins. After the fork there's huge uncertainty, so I'd expect a big sell off into other cryptocurrencies the second the segwit2x block goes through.
So... If I were buying more coins my current thinking would be to wait over the course of this next ~week for a big dip, and once (if) that comes, buy then to ensure I get the B2X coins too. I'd then be waiting until the minute the fork happens to trade for ETH, BCH, or some other altcoin where I'd expect to see a big spike as others looking for stability also trade into.
Of course this is not financial advice and everything I've said could be wrong :).
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:28:19
Yeah... I had a sell order at $9950 but cancelled it; I think there's a good chance there won't be much of a dip at the 10k barrier with all the new influx we're seeing - although I'm still mulling it over.

Now they've been asking me about it. Never listen to family is the life lesson. -.-
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:46:48
If you don't care to know anything about them and want to invest for the long term, just buy between 70% and 100% bitcoin, and the rest etherium. The two do different things so shouldn't be competing too much in the future (they track each other now due to most of the value being speculative), and both have primacy, which counts for a lot. You can buy a third coin like litecoin if you want obviously, but I think people should do a fair amount of their own research before buying outside of BTC or ETH. Pretty much all of the top ~15 cryptos have something interesting going on.

@_date: 2017-11-27 15:48:00
Largely, yes. Other than for a few use cases like making donations or for use in less-stable markets, Bitcoin isn't the best for transactional currency - you pay to buy Bitcoin then pay to spend it. All while if you believe in it in the long term, knowing that you're spending something that very soon will be worth a lot more than the product you're buying with it (see 10,000 BTC pizza). In a few years I expect the situation to change.

@_date: 2017-11-02 11:16:29
Yeah, if you have full control over the wallet you should be fine. A hard fork is literally that, it just divides everything in two. Exchanges are a bit tricky as you don't actually own the bitcoin on them generally, it's just a contract between you and them. Because of that some exchanges have been a bit funny about giving people an equivalent to their BTC in BCH. I'd be a little less wary with this B2X fork, as if the exchange wants to stay in business they should be accommodating it, but still, retaining control over your own wallet is always the safest option.

Things have come a long way since Mt.Gox, and if you're wanting to algotrade you can achieve considerably better returns when you have enough Bitcoins to manipulate the market (which ~20+ can do); or just through staying liquid if you like moving between altcoins. That said, this post suggests you shouldn't use Bittrex.

@_date: 2017-11-30 00:01:39

It's always a good time right now if you believe in it in the long run; just don't have a heart attack when it next dips and trust it'll recover. With the CME announcement we can expect a load of new money coming in in the near future with uncertainty over segwit2x over the next few weeks (especially after next week).

Only $100k? I just bought $5 worth of bitcoin; anyone saying I'm not going to be a millionaire by Christmas is clueless! HODL!

It's great to hear real world use, but I do wonder who's making purchases with bitcoin right now when it's so bullish.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:13:28
Well, ~15% if you're not going by 1 minute extrema. Given that the growth retracted only to where it had been 24 hours previously I don't see it as a big dip at all, no. I guess this is all personal opinion though.

I've not been following BCH so couldn't tell you... it's up 50% this week though (10% today). Whether that'll continue or you're better off putting your money in BTC I don't know - obviously 50% in 7d is more susceptible to crashing. I wouldn't be surprised if we see BTC flatten out or drop a little in the next few days once the CME hype has died down either though.
That said, if you've got a lot of BCH I'd certainly be inclined to keep some in for the long run, but that's just me.

Suspended, not killed. It seems like they knew they didn't have the support so kicked the can down the road. This is now something we're probably going to have to deal with all over again at some point, creating yet more uncertainty and counter to the goal of increasing bitcoin trust and adoption.

It's 50/50. At round numbers, especially 10k, there's a huge psychological barrier where everyone's set sell points on exchanges so you have a huge sell wall of millions of dollars... There's not much behind that so you know the second BTC breaks 10k it's going to shoot up. It did. After that you can assume there'll be a huge sell-off as people try to take profits. There was. Where that sell-off ends is guess work. The reason people believe this is going to happen is because this is what normally happens after all these big round numbers.

If you've already purchased through coinbase then it should be listed on your gdax account too. There isn't a mobile app because (their official line - which I agree with) the mobile Web interface is designed to be just as good as an app. If you save it to your phone so it's an icon you can't event tell the difference. That said, whilst it's good to buy through gdax, if you're not trading I wouldn't leave your money on an exchange; buy through gdax then transfer your money to your own wallet - use electrum if you have a small amount of bitcoin, use a hardware wallet like trezor, or a paper wallet, if you have a large amount. If you want to trade (and keep in mind the majority of people are left worse off from trading - you really have to do a lot of homework), then you should use a better exchange like bittrex.

They're not wrong. Currently (until LN is properly tested and fully in use) there are very few good reasons to use bitcoin as a payment method.

Corbyn and May are both sucky... that doesn't make this option better. UKIP are essentially Trumpian. They're ultra-populist, they'll tell you everything bad about your life is due to either immigrants, other countries, or the current government, and the former leader, Nigel Farage, has been embroiled in the same covert Russian meetings in the lead up to brexit that Trump's been involved in around his election.
