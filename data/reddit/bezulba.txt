And it's straight into the dumpster when it popped the 10k!

You do know that those kiosks charge an insane markup all for convenience right? You didn't want to take time off to do it before hand, so you had to pay the premium price..
Lack of planning on your part etc etc.

doesn't stop the circle jerk though.. it's almost as if most commenter's here just refuse to see that Bitcoins biggest problem is it's anonymity. It's a dream come true for everybody who wants to make money out of illegal things, hell even legal companies might start to get tempted to have deposits of Bitcoins instead of actual money. If the IRS can't find that you own it, it can't be taxed.

You are going to pay for a wedding?

Even somebody as internet savvy as myself would rather have a day in the week to arrange things like mortgage then do it over the internet...

But that's be logic man, we can't have logic in this circlejerk.
Just like we can't explain that prosecuting one person is far, far, far easier then tacking on a big institution like a bank.. just look at big tobacco, there's a reason why any lawsuit against them takes decades... but nooo, this is the little men getting fucked, because money laundering should be legal and he's really a great guy!

yeah because banks going under is such a cool event!
I love not being able to access my money or having to wait for the government to pay up the amount i'm insured for.

The last time you folk all went bananas over the rise of bitcoin prices, it dropped so deep it left a crater a mile wide.
@_date: 2016-06-24 09:50:00
Pretty sad really. 
@_date: 2016-06-26 08:18:13
you make it sound like i get nothing for my taxes.
And i can leave and go to another country and live in the bush. Nobody is stopping me from doing that. Why don't i do that? Because i like my taxes. I like the things it gives me. I like being in a country where i can walk about in the "ghetto" at night and not get mugged.

Taxes are the price i pay for a civilised society.. i'm sorry i'm not an American who believes that everything comes magically out of the sky and doesn't cost anything.
Yes, there are problems with the financial institutions. Yes they need to be solved, but cheering for the collapse of the entire system is lunacy. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 09:13:09
What have you been smoking and can i have some? Because it has to be pretty damn potent.

Ireland leaving the EU?
They themselves benefit so much from being in the EU that it would be insanity to leave.
Just look at all the big tech companies stationed there to take advantage of cheaper imports. They'd all leave.

It's like putting your lifesavings on Red.. and then just praying it works.
That's not smart. That's pretty fucking stupid.

Explain to me, exactly, how bitcoins is going to make banks go away? 
Say i want to buy a house. i make 20 bitcoins a year and i need 100 for the house. I need a loan. Is bitcoin magically going to get me those 100 bitcoins to pay for my house?

I'm sorry, i'm one of those assholes. If you didn't know what the hell you were doing, why the hell were you doing it in the first place? Everywhere on the internet you are warned that virtual currency isn't backed by anything, thus it could lose it's value very, very very fast. If you didn't take this into account when investing in it, well, shame on you then. It's not that hard to understand.. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:12:57
or wait a few days. it's not like the decent is stopping any time soon by the looks of it
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:20:05
and thus we weed out a couple of idiots...
Seriously though, who in their right mind would quit their job without cashing out? And what kind of moron do you have to be to take a loan to invest in something as volatile as bitcoins... 
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:15:48
what pity should people get who lost it all in this crash? It's their own bloody damn fault.
Or should i feel sorry for idiots who put their entire mortgage on red with roulette and lose?
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:55:20
like i said before, if you haven't done the research on something as new as virtual currency then it is still your own fault for being in this mess.
