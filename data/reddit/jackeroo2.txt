As a frequent user of public transit (albeit in Toronto) I know what you mean. Thanks for explaining it like I'm 5 though.

The fuck did  I just read?

Getwork is up but Stratum isn't. Odd.
@_date: 2013-04-16 13:35:51
Well shit, I bought at 150, and again at 240. Thankfully I didn't buy too much, I could have lost way more.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:11:56
Too bad it is the Gox.

You mean the 79XX series of graphics cards right?
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:55:10
I bought .25 BTC heh heh

The lag on the gox is quite humorous. Currently around 60 seconds.

You sir embody Canadian generosity. The amount of gold you have given out in this thread is impressive.

Currently, I have a pretty crappy setup so when I run any client there is a noticeable slowdown in my computer's performance. You'd have to try it out yourself and see what happens. To answer your second question, it depends on the GPU in the additional computers. If they have a low hash rate, there isn't any point in mining on them as you will lose money in electricity costs. My advice to you is to play around, and see what setup is the most profitable for you. You can use a calculator such as [this one]( to determine your estimated profit.

Keep in mind English has existed for hundreds of years (yes it has grown and evolved), and most likely will continue to do so. That is assuming that world isn't taken over by China in the near future.

How do you cancel your order?

What about Canada? :(

Yeah, same here. I must admit I was somewhat panicked when the crash happened, but luckily I can afford to lose the money I invested. I intend on holding on to my 1.5 BTC for a long time.

Haha thanks a lot. And thanks for running a great site. Good luck with your beta testing. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:34:47
Thank you my friend. My first tip!
@_date: 2013-04-19 01:50:11
What site is this?
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:52:34
Just realized my post was late. I apologize. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:37:47
See people? The price is already on its way up, and will probably stabilize around 180$. Expect more growth tomorrow.
EDIT: I wrote this comment earlier, before the mass fluctuations started happening (dammit Mt. Gox). It probably won't stabilize at 180$, however this is irrelevant because we will see growth tomorrow anyways. Count on it.
@_date: 2013-04-16 23:49:23
Looks like we're back
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:18:04
I would recommend starting with Bitminter then. Basically all you have to do is set up an account, download their client and run it. Alternatively, I would recommend slush's pool. 
EDIT: You can use other mining software with Bitminter as well.

Where can I purchase some of these?
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:39:11
Why is the price on the Gox down to 120$? Bitfloor is trading at 140 still.
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:52:18
I have always used VirWox. Bitfloor looks like a good exchange though.
@_date: 2013-05-07 12:17:28
Probably should have looked at this list before I made a Jalapeno order May 3rd. I don't know what I expected :/

How did you obtain said voucher?
