I don't understand - if I have BTC on Coinbase. Am I losing out if I don't cash it out? If I have 10 BTC as of now, will I still have 10 BTC on August 1st? It's just the price will likely be unpredictable?
Or is my BTC getting split into 5 BTC and 5 BCC if I am not on coinbase?  Or I will have 10 BTC and "Free" BCC also?
Very confused.

Ah gotcha. 
So keeping my money on Coinbase is literally throwing away 10 free BCC?

Thanks for chiming in.  Not to say I don't believe you because you seem knowledgable, but could you point me to a source where I can read more about this?  
As you can see, a lot of conflicting information.

Noob here:
So if I have BTC on coinbase and am not interested in the new Coin, do I just do nothing?  
Or because coinbase isn't supporting BCC, am I losing half of my money or something?
