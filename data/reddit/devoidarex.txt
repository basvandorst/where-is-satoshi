I do have a little left, and I'll buy more when it drops, which I think it probably will.

Just google it with 'reddit' in the search. There are some guides. I just transfered my bitcoin to Quadrigacx after getting my account verified and sold it at market value.

Sold them on Quadrigacx and just withdrew the cash via EFT into my chequing account. I haven't seen the cash yet. Said 5-7 days, no fee.

I already own my home outright and am debt free. I'm doing fine financially. My concern with bitcoin is that the hedge funds are getting involved which is bad news in my opinion. If it crashes, I'll buy in again. If it doesn't, c'est la vie.

I bought 3 bitcoins for a out $50 CDN a few years ago. Spent a few and had 0.75 left which I sold this morning for about $14,000 CDN. I'm pretty happy with the return, but it was hard to pull the trigger knowing what I might miss out on.

In Canada any amounts of 10K or more are logged by FINTRAC (a federal government bureaucracy) which is meant to guard against money laundering and other illegal transactions used by organized crime and the like.

I recently bought my first (and only) bitcoins. I took cash to a bank and deposited in the account of an online Canadian company. The next day I had my bitcoins.
I wan't charged a fee, just a cost per bitcoin. I spent $39.95 on a VPN and have $10.85 left... (.8XXXX BTC).
It was easy and there were no 'fees', though I suppose the company I bought from charged a little over the going rate (though I didn't check what it was). Either way, I spent $50 and actually got more than my money's worth.
As a noob, I can't complain.

Still in school, huh?
