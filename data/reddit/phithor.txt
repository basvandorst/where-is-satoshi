He did not imply that it will go as high. He implied it will go higher than it is today, as many people including myself believe. 
Just stop it, you are accomplishing nothing with your post.

Why? As you say, supply and demand. If more of bitcoin holders used bitcoin at these places, which in turn they would sell for fiat, would not that cause a higher supply not a higher demand? Are you assuming they will use Bitcoin for their trade/people will buy bitcoin to pay with it?

The country is the victim, as there are a lot of consequences with drugs. You have to understand that the policy makers make the laws from an overall strategy. This can include to make it harder to perform crimes or harder to aid criminals.  
Is this a law in the US or just a philosophy some people believe in?

Again, are we talking philosophy here or practical lawmaking? 
We obviously have different principles regarding this topic, but I disagree with your opinion that the country is not an individual that can not be victimized. The country, or the humans/society within(as you require a human as a victim), is harmed when people or oganizations cheat the system for personal gain. This includes money laundering and insider trading.
I can agree that many people can use recreational drugs controlled and that does not hurt anyone. I can agree that taking a drug in it self should not be criminalized in the way that it is. On the other hand, some people can not control their drug addiction, and that creates a lot of problems which have victims. You can say that you have laws against stealing and what these people might do, but as a policy maker you would want to minimize that. How far back are you stopping the thought of a butterfly effect? There are also a lot of problems with the illegal traficking of drugs which you can not deny. Of course, this can be said to be a direct cause of the criminalization. 
I was curious about this way of thinking and I saw that people thought this also ment that there should not be seat belt laws, texting while driving bans etc. I believe that in a society one should be required to sacrifice personal liberty towards a goal of a safer and better(however you meassure) society for all. I think this is where we disagree.
