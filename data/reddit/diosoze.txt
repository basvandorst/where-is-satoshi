Unfortunately in a way, even cash does. Thus the whole practice of civil forfeiture, where individuals are forced by the police to hand over large amounts of money, then prove in a court later that they obtained it lrgally.

In an inebriated state, you can call any person that you want - unlicensed, unregulated and unidentifiable - to drive you someplace. You can meet a complete stranger at a bar and drive across the entire country with them, if you wish.
The rule only changes when money is involved.
Thus, unless exchange of currency somehow impacts the quality of the driver (doubtful), there is no reason to restrict this kind of voluntary interaction.

From an investment point of view I would not look into Bitcoin - too much volatility. And from a trading POV I don't know, but I would suspect that volume makes it very risky.
As far as its utility as a cryptocurrency, at the moment it is largely unrivaled. I think this is where it is important. People who are looking to buy and hold Bitcoin as an investment may end up getting burned.

It isn't even a Bitcoin issue. It's a bad regulation because it isn't consistent with reality.
It's a rule that says you cannot voluntarily ask someone to drive you home if you pay them to do so.
However, the exact same action would be fine if no money exchanges hands. You could even meet a complete stranger in a bar in Las Vegas and drive to New York City together that very day, without knowing how qualified they are, if they are a good driver, or even what their name is.
