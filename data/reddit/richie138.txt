I'm not 100% on this but I think amazon pays less than other retailers for credit card transactions.

I heard about that.  Unfortunately I'm not expecting much anyway.  I'm not under the impression that people often donate to developers.

A blonde and a brunette get into an elevator and punch in two of the highest floors. They do not know each other, so they stay to themselves.
About halfway up to their respective floors, a balding gentleman enters the elevator with them, with some of the most atrocious dandruff either of the women had even seen gracing the shoulders of his suit. He didn’t seem to notice, but they were practically revolted for the trip.
His floor came up quickly and as the door shut from his exit, the brunette looked up to the blond and commented “That man needs to get some Head and Shoulders.”
The blonde got really confused before asking, “Wait, how do you give shoulders?”

A man goes home after work and announces proudly to his wife “Honey, I missed the bus today but I saved $2 by chasing after it all the way home!”
His wife fixes him with a look of pure contempt and says “You fool!! You could have saved $75 if you’d chased after a cab!”

Two brooms were hanging in the closet and after a while they got to know each other so well, they decided to get married. One broom was, of course, the bride broom, the other the groom broom.
The bride broom looked very beautiful in her white dress. The groom broom was handsome and suave in his tuxedo. The wedding was lovely.
After the wedding, at the wedding dinner, the bride-broom leaned over and said to the groom-broom, ‘I think I am going to have a little whisk broom!’
‘IMPOSSIBLE!’ said the groom broom. ‘We haven’t even swept together!’
