If you code this up as an algorithm, just remember to check for divide by zero errors.

I wrote the following on another thread:
'Apparently total wealth in the world is about 240 trillion dollars. If you assume just 1% of the worlds wealth might be eventually held in bitcoin and you do a bit of rounding - assume 21 million bitcoins and $210 trillion total wealth - I get a value of about $100,000 each bitcoin. All the gold in the world is worth about $6 trillion which is about 2.5% of the total wealth in the world, so a figure of 1% for bitcoin doesn't sound too farfetched.'
I think it will take at least 50 - 70 years to get there though.

Yeah, I'd say when bitcoin is used for 1% of financial transactions we're probably 80% of the way there.

Here in Australia most credit cards have a chip in them and most retailers offer PayWave (tap and go) for values under $100. This takes less than 10 seconds. Over $100 requires a pin and takes 20 seconds. It nearly always works flawlessly.
Last time I was in the States - earlier this year, there were hardly any pin terminals, they were mostly magnetic strip readers and it was painful in comparison. Every third or fourth time they failed to read the card correctly - just like it used to happen in Australia before they got rid of them years ago now.

If you are buying to hold as an investment, expect to hold for at least 20 years or longer. In my case I bought a few so my children and grand children ( might ) benefit, not me.
I really can't understand the point of buying now and holding for just a few years. If bitcoin catches on and goes up 10x, I can't see any reason why it wouldn't keep going up further, for a long time.

I only ever asked once, at a restaurant. The guy said no - and I hope we never do :-/

Large price fluctuations are absolutely inevitable until Bitcoins true value is found. Pick a reasonable price that you think bitcoin is worth if it becomes a global currency. Any price... $5,000, $50,000, $500,000 it doesn't matter. Do you think it is going to get there via a straight line? Not going to happen.
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:46:41
Also, the large price swings won't hurt growth if more and more people see the value in it. Truth is, that up until the last dip, everyone who has ever bought Bitcoin would have 'made' money as long as they held onto it securely. This could be true for many years yet, if Bitcoin has real value, despite the swings.

When we were in New York a year ago hiring a car there was a very forlorn Swedish couple sitting nearby desperately making phone calls. Turns out their credit card wouldn't work so they couldn't hire a car and their vacation possibly ruined. We always travel with 2 credit cards plus a debit card ( kept in different luggage ) for just these events. Also lots of places won't even accept debit cards or if they do they will put like $400 ( e.g. hotels ) on it. It can take a few days for this charge to come off again, so it's easy to have $1200 to $2000 in temporary charges on these cards.

If it is a fair bit of value and you are worried you might make a mistake I would purchase a small amount of bitcoin and practice first.

Cash has to be counted and deposited in a bank. This takes time and effort. There is also a risk of it being stolen.

Just eyeballing that line, it looks like it will hit $2K well before 2018. In fact by the end of 2018 it looks to be over $4K - more like $6K or $8K

Some things in bitcoins favour:
* For many of us it is much easier to buy and sell than gold
* You know its the real thing - lot of fake gold around
* Buy and sell any amount
* The buy/sell spread is much less
[Here is an interesting article]( showing how hard it can be to sell gold.

I don't sell it anymore but it was just a little $25 consumer app. I sold several hundred copies a year for quite a few years. I wasn't really expecting that much interest but considering I offered a 20% discount for bitcoin and got zero takers, it was a bit disappointing.
@_date: 2017-01-13 01:56:20
Ever since I offered bitcoin as a payment method for software I sell and got NO takers for over a year, I have come to the conclusion that bitcoin will have to establish itself as a decent asset class first. When people see that they can buy into bitcoin and, despite its volatility, be reasonably assured that its value will be higher in a few years, more and more will do so. Being able to buy and sell bitcoin easily is a big part of that.

Strange that banks in Australia don't seem to have any problems with US citizens opening accounts. You just need to show your Social Security Number or Tax Identification Number.

At the risk of repeating myself:

Yeh, I was just pointing out that the title didn't match the graph, especially for for the near future.
I actually think it's such early days that the price could go quite crazy, both up and down, for many years yet.

I'd rather pay the tax and sleep well at night.

So how many idiots here managed to convince a friend or loved one to buy bitcoin in the last week or two and now has a bit of explaining to do?
@_date: 2016-05-16 07:25:03
The truth right there. I am surprised this isn't more widely understood. It was a lucky fluke that bitcoin grew to a huge size before anyone - particularly governments - realised what was going on. Hopefully it's too late to stop it now.

Why not just store the encrypted key on dropbox or a throwaway email account? Then access it when you are safe.

I bought some bitcoin from Coinjar earlier this year and never paid GST, except on the service fee.
@_date: 2016-07-02 00:49:21
Yeah, we basically do the same except we do carry some cash. The cash we carry however is our own currency, not the currency of the country we are travelling to. We always get some cash out of an ATM at the airport when we arrive and figure if our cards don't work then we can easily exchange some of our cash for local currency ( even if the rate sucks ) to tide us over.

For what it is worth, I read the whole thing too. And I agree with you. Absolutely fascinating read and way to elaborate to be a hoax. Truth is stranger than fiction etc. but time will tell I guess.

A trust will cost 1 to 2grand.

It's a bit of a Catch-22 and if anything it will force it to become completely legal. Imagine a few 10s of million pissed off people who can't access their data because they aren't allowed to buy the very thing that they need to get their data back. Or a bunch of public hospitals, or even whole gov. departments.

I also bought bitcoin from Coinjar earlier this year and didn't pay any tax. Coin jar is still operating in Australia.

Spend 1 BTC on some serious financial advice, particularly setting up a trust to protect you from divorce rape etc. Do this before you get a girlfriend because even living with someone for a while can cause problems in some places.
