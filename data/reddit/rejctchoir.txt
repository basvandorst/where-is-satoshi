looks like someone is on it. The Coinbase CEO replied [here]( about this specific issue (his name is Brian Armstrong)

It's been 10 hours. I really doubt the anchor at the end of my chain is ever going to get confirmed though.

I guess I'm a little confused about the incentive for that block to get processed. 24kb and 600 outputs is pretty big, right? Why would anyone process it when there are 5k other unconfirmed transactions out?

The amount that I would be comfortable with loosing if there is another high profile hack or some dumb legislation, honestly. My risky investments are in BTC

I agree. I don't know much about the way the bitcoin sausage is made though.

[Willing to bet it was because of this](
What was your tx hash? Coinads.com screwed up and sent a transaction that was 24kb with a .005 fee. Coinbase included some unconfirmed outputs from this rouge transaction in their wallet. Should be fixed now (or soon). I had 13btc held up for a couple of days, but now its in my wallet. Not happy about coinbase's customer support, but I have my money now at least

The problem is that it won't confirm until [this guy]( gets confirmed. And that guy probably will never get confirmed. It's been unconfirmed for 48 hours. How long is too long? This was a btc to btc transfer, not a bank transfer btw.
