I feel like a lot of people are about to get screwed. 
1) any miner video you see on YouTube never includes the tax implications in their expense calculus (which they should since the IRS says gains are calculated when the block is mined, not sold for fiat).
2) gains are calculated AT THE MOMENT OF ANY TRANSACTION, not when it’s sold for fiat. That means if I give you some BTC to pay you back for dinner, I need to calculate the gains I had on that amount of BTC and report it to the IRS. Absolutely nobody is doing that.

You raise a good technicality about it being an "ATM from company XYZ."
That said, I think it's always good to walk through bitcoin from "grandma's" point of view, as it makes it easier to see where the usability holes are.
I'd say most grandmas would see the Bitcoin logo and go "oh great! There's a bank provided by bitcoin!" There's a massive point of confusion there that needs to somehow be addressed.
OpenID, like HDDVD, is a great standard on paper, but better doesn't necessarily mean it gets used.

1. That's not how costing works. It's not "free" because you're already paying them. They don't have _anything else_ they could be working on? If not, why are they working at all? How many development hours would it take? If it's truly 30 minutes to integrate with your existing inventory/payment system, then sure, no big deal, but if it's 40 development hours, and you're paying a dev $50/hour (cheap), that's a $2K implementation cost.
2. Basic market research. Survey existing users to ask how many are holding Bitcoin, or would be interested in paying via Bitcoin. Research the Bitcoin transaction volume of other businesses in your industry (or any industry). Overstock publishes these numbers to establish _some_ kind of prediction. You need a business reason to do this in the first place, so why make it all guesswork?
3. Look at your monthly revenue, and based on the research done on  figure out what percentage of that revenue might be made up of Bitcoin transactions vs. traditional transactions. Then, figure out the 9% of that number to determine how much more you're making because Bitcoin was made available.
Lastly, do the math to figure out how many months it will take to pay back that initial $2K.

Sorry, being a "Bitcoin millionaire" doesn't make you a good entrepreneur, or CEO. 
Your proposal contains the same lack of vision the Foundation suffers from. Leadership is about inspiring people into action, not telling them to do something. Your proposal falls firmly in the latter camp.
Additionally, the proposal itself lacks substance, and reads like you're just angry because you're not on the board. 
All too often the Bitcoin community tries to solve strategic, human problems with a new algorithm, software, or additional security. The fact that the BF is being apparently opaque is not a problem that can be solved with software.

Thank you, my knight!
Jeesh. You're the Bitcoin equivalent of a "truther"
I don't see any response from Mt Gox that seems unreasonable or implausible. If you've gone too deep with Bitcoin, I could understand your personal feelings clouding judgement, but it doesn't seem that way from my view. If the government is investigating you, you're legally not allowed to comment, or disclose details. No amount of protesting will change that. Anything beyond that is 100% speculation.
All this post has demonstrated to me is you're really good at throwing good money after bad. That $3K you spent traveling could have been better spent gambling in an alternative exchange.
@_date: 2014-12-11 21:39:41
For someone who wants Bitcoin to succeed, your answers are pretty lacking. My question has merit. Bitcoin is incredibly inconvenient, and that's the secret to mass-adoption, not unparalleled security. No Bitcoin companies are doing much to solve that problem, which is where my original question came from. Why not?

So what you're suggesting is to get the only realized benefit of decentralization, you have to recreate, from scratch, YouTube, Dropbox, Facebook, Spotify and ISPs, simultaneously. Good luck.
A bit of a sensationalist headline, but if you're _literally_ trying to recreate these things, maybe consider what goes into running them.
The companies you've given as examples are the most expensive technology companies in the world. Many operate at low-to-zero margins. How do you expect to address this inherent challenge with Bitcloud?
Also, wouldn't they all need to come at once? If we're all as secure as our weakest link, that would mean using Bitcloud's ISP, but regular Netflix would be flawed. Or "Bitflix" on a regular ISP, similarly flawed.

Is there a chance that NYSE, others, did this investment for the data?
It was disclosed that NYSE, USAA were minority investors. Consider the fact that getting access to proprietary Coinbase data (like, say, the algo that Coinbase uses for determining BTC -&gt; USD prices) would give them a huge advantage over the competition in terms of boosting the value of the product they sell to their customers.
"A leading provider of _financial information and market data_ and has worked through its benchmark administration business to restore confidence and integrity in financial data."
What better way to get unparalleled financial information and market data than investing in the source? Maybe this is just a case of enough customers saying "hey, what's up with this Bitcoin thing? How does it compare to other assets?" and they determined that it was worth buying by way of investment. If they can sell $50mm worth of financial analysis by having access to this data, $10mm up-front is an easy choice, regardless of what ends up happening to Bitcoin long-term.
So maybe it's _not_ a vote of confidence in Bitcoin, but just an acknowledgement that the data Coinbase has is valuable, and the only way to access it is by investing.
@_date: 2015-01-20 22:22:21
I'm just referencing the language the NYSE used in its own press release to announce this investment. 
Typically press releases allude to the intended purpose of the investment, which is why I mentioned their emphasis on "information"
As in, maybe the reason they invested isn't just to say "we support Bitcoin" which has no measurable return

Investment? Bitcoin is not an investment. It was never an investment. If that's what you think it is, you're betraying the intent of just about everyone involved in its creation.
From Mike Hearn's post above: "Bitcoin is not intended to be an investment and has always been advertised pretty accurately: as an experimental currency which you shouldn’t buy more of than you can afford to lose."
I actually realized a gain selling today. But it really doesn't matter; I wanted Bitcoin to work, and now I see it won't.

What a well written post. I completely forgot about my holdings for all of 2015, assuming things were humming right along in terms of innovation and creating measures to avoid cannibalization and inconvenience.
Instead, it's clear that virtually everything that was promising about Bitcoin at the end of 2014 has completely evaporated over the past year. I'm completely shocked that the community allowed this to happen, given the apparent checks and balances in place, but here we are.
The headline is what reminded that I own BTC. And the post is what convinced me to sell all of it.

Running at break even, or a loss, hasn’t  hurt Amazon at all. It’s what’s required to grow a company very quickly when you’re going for a land-grab.
