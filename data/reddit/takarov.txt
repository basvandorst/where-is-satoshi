This just in, ISIS trying to raise funds with US Dollars and Great British pounds!

As someone put it in another thread: viable, cheap, and decentralized banking. People in the third world and in economically restricted countries can do business internationally with a lower barrier of entry.

Alright, I'm new to a lot of economics and finance, but would a service that holds your bitcoins and provides the equivalent of cashier's checks be a viable option? In exchange for BTC, they'd issue something that you'd give to the company assuring that the amount of BTC is on your account and will be transferred? Based off of my limited knowledge, if we just choose to deal with the longer waits, a trustworthy system which ensures that, despite the longer wait, the company can trust they will receive payment could help solve issues on small transactions.

The thing is, my summer will only be lost in the case of a crash. It will be impacted negatively if I buy between 900-1000 and that turns out to be a high. Sure, I'd have less money, but I should still have enough to afford plane tickets and I should have no reasonable issues finding work at a hostel (my plan to cover the vast majority of expenses in-country). I think the difference that a few more hundred (or thousand if you're looking at the more extremely optimistic projections) and how that can impact the quality of life and how much I can experience is worth the risk, from what I can tell. But I first want to know if there are any hidden scenarios or possibilities I hadn't thought of that would affect whether or not I think it's an acceptable risk.

But the issue is less about acceptance, I think, and more about how strong the incentive to hoard BTC is.

I don't know where you're getting the idea that I said that from or why you paired it with my quote about reasonability of thought processes. Better yet, I have a question for you. Do you advocate unreasonable,  baseless predictions instead of reasonable,  information based predictions? Because it seems to me that you have an opinion contrary to the validity of reasonable predictions based on you picking out that quote. Also, you're still off-topic.

That's exactly the sort of thing I'm looking for, but for the people who are bearish.
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:43:25
Very true. Just to play devil's advocate, a large rally could breach it from a pretty significant price gap and pop the $1000 cherry without us realizing, so to speak. I think we'll get close enough to the $1000 mark before the end of the year, so it will be interesting to watch the behavior as it approaches. Thanks for pointing this out. I hadn't thought of this.

It's that I'm going to be taking your word as is, because I'm sure there will be dissent in opinions. Why would I think that BTC will be above $1000 in 6 months? Without a major decrease in the growth rate, it will easily break $1000 before April. Looking at the increasing pace of adoption by companies and governments internationally combined with potential for growth with third-world entrepreneurs using BTC as a platform for international business done cheaper and more efficiently, that's what I think will most likely happen. 
But to just go based off of that would be to assume there will be no major slowing in growth rate and no mass exodus. Either of those could happen, but I can't think of any specific scenarios that would cause that. That's why I came here. Someone who thinks there's a solid chance BTC might drastically slow has likely thought of a scenario or event that would cause it that I hadn't thought of.

Long term, yeah, but I'm looking at a short term 6 month investment. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:29:15
I read an article on the subject on a different site. The thing that really stood out to me was that it's "entirely speculation" and could have just been a large-sized narco-trafficking organization putting money into their account in an attempt to try out the security of buying through BTC/Tor.

I'm not looking for people to tell me what's going to happen, I'm looking for why people think what may happen may actually happen. I'd be willing to bet money there are things they're factoring into their thought process that I missed. Get what I mean?
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:15:36
Read the first post you illiterate cunt. The entire purpose for this is asking for what factors I'm missing and I'm not advocating my prediction to anyone. Do you realize how dense you have to be to come read a thread where someone is asking for other people's prediction models to change his own and accuse him of advocating the very model he is trying to improve and of not considering the feedback he's asking for? Christ, how old are you that you lack basic reading comprehension?
Let me simplify this for you.
My first post: Hey guys, I'm looking for more information to complete my model. What other factors do you have that I'm missing?
Your general response: You're an idiot because you're telling us to use an incomplete model and you're not even bothering to think about other factors you might have missed.
Do you seriously not see the disconnect?

It would be cool of someone wrote an intro to finance guide based off of bitcoin.

It's like fucking star trek all up in this bitch.

The sentence after that goes into why it would be a reasonable (though not necessarily correct) prediction that it would continue without a major decrease. I am very aware of the number of factors that influence BTC price and the fact that it could decrease or crash. What I asked for in both the original post and the post you're responding to is what would make a crash or slowdown a reasonable prediction as well. 
BTC could also, theoretically, go up to one million dollars and become so volatile that the price is random at any given moment. Is there any reason whatsoever to consider that reasonable? No, because I haven't given any indication as to why that would be a reasonable guess. That which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. *I don't want to dismiss a crash or slow-down, but I am looking for reasoning that would make that a reasonable prediction*. 
If instead of bashing me for not knowing the answer the very question I'm trying to ask, you could provide me with a few of those million factors that would cause a crash or slowdown, that would be more relevant to the topic here.

From what I know, I'm in agreement with you of seeing $1000 quickly, but I am much more unsure of how it will behave post-1000 in the short term. It will be interesting to see.
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:29:38
Good advice. And I'm actually looking for the opposite. I know why I should be bullish, but I don't know why I should be bearish yet. I want to know why so I can weigh both sides.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:54:31
Go ahead an post something on here, see if you can't organize some sort of movement to get local places to accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:57:06
What makes you think that?
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:05:03
It'll be easier to address everything if I number this, so bear with me.
1. I'm saving half and living on the other half I make. My expenses are minimal, so it's doable.
2. I'm not going to fall short of what I *need*, but I just don't have much breathing room there. Working more came to mind first, but I literally can't work more than I am right now.
3. I'm where you're at. I'm bullish, especially long-term, but 6 months is not so long term. On top of that, as you said, they have some good arguments. I want to know what those arguments are and how they rebut bullish arguments (e.g. why it's a bubble despite increased adoption and usefulness).
4. If this money was just spending money or money I had to invest, the prospect of a slowdown or a crash is not enough, IMO, to stop me from putting it into BTC. In fact, I've already put some of that money in (though there isn't too much in the first place). In the long term, I'm very confident it will stick around. I'm a little more skeptical when it comes to short term when I have more being risked, which is why I'm seeking out the bears here.
Also, that's actually a very interesting idea. I actually hadn't even thought of spending BTC itself there.
