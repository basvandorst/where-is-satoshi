the governing body of a nation, state, or **community.**
I dunno, maybe my view of a government is broader than yours, but it's all the same to me.
PS, you don't have to waste your time explaining it, but I'm not going to waste my time looking for a comment.

To be fair, those are both kinda shit and realistically act for whoever pays them. I don't think most citizens will be able to afford a bodyguard.

*It CAN be up to 300 mWh per transaction - that number is actually the cost to mine a block.
It's closer to 270 KWh - so ~$32 worth, if it was mined in US @ 12c a KWh (it's not).
Pls don't share that kind of FU

So ... a government...?
You get what I mean? A government is just a group of people putting their resources together for the greater good. That kind of structure just has a high probability of corruption. A necessary evil, that we should try and minimize.

The same thing is true with any currency, the only problem with BTC is that it is currently very volatile. This will fix itself over time.
