I suspect that the 1% is now trying to maneuver bitcoin into collapse, but it won't work. Indeed, I'm very sure they recognize BTC as a real threat to the oppressive control they have over the world economy.
All of a sudden, China decides to turn its back on BTC? Let me ask you all this question: who helps boost China's economy? The very same people who have the clout to threaten the Chinese government to reject BTC as a valid currency - or else lose their business, thus facing a massive collapse of that country's economy. 
Let's take a look at the American Banks' recent attempt to assimilate bitcoins, as well. The only thing they don't seem to understand is: BTC is largely favored as an anonymous means of currency. In other words, a safeguard against a cashless society. 
In order to buy/sell bitcoin through these big banks, they *require* you to provide full proof of your identity. Typical bitcoin exchange companies don't do the same; you can trade/sell/buy anonymously through certain means. Cash was meant to be private tender, so therefore bitcoin is a reasonable substitute for that - in case paper money goes obsolete in the future.
BTC is used for a reason in many situations, when it comes to personal and private means of exchange, just like cash, with a major difference: it answers to no nation, corporation, nor person. In addition, bitcoin allows the 99% of the population to exert more control over the equal distribution of monetary flow, instead of the 1%'s tight grip and manipulation of the long-standing, currently-dominant monetary system.
Just putting in my two cents as an observer of human nature. I strongly feel that the uber-wealthy are going on the offensive to preserve the status quo that they've enjoyed for far too long.
