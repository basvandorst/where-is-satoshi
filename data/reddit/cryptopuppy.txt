Good because I don't think I'll be able to handle 20-40% swings at $100,000+

To be fair every dip has looked like a head and shoulders and Everytime some one points it out. Not saying we won't go down but it's happened...every time.

What you don't see is the same guy buying right below it. It'll be lifted once the whales had his fill

Or he sells it for $500k and laughs at you for ever selling your BTC.

See you at 50k ;)

I sold off most of my stack between $4300-8000
I needed the money, was up around 5000%. It is what it is, can't beat yourself up about it.

There's stocks like berkshire and hathaway worth almost $ 250,000. Theres way more people interested in buying BTC then berkshire and hathaway because BTC is global. 
No reason BTC cant be as high or higher. I just think once BTC is over $100k .01% growth will be huge and things will slow way down but up non the less.

I lost around 12 BTC playing yobit coin flips
to be fair I made around 30 total. 
I would bet very small until I got 8-10 loses or wins in a row then bet the opposite for up to 1 BTC. 
Had a 40+ BTC stack. 
This was a little over a year ago

What happens if I told you it won't ever stop going up in the long run.

Crazy cocaine addict predicts $1 million BTC

yobit dice is rigged imo. My strat was working great, ran up it nice over a few days but when I lost the 12 I had something like 18 loses in a row. Statistically that's very rare. So I took my profits and left.

When BTC is $50k there will be no need to cash out. I would assume people will be selling houses, cars almost everything in crypto that or you'll be able to buy VISA token with BTC.

Yes, they are being flooded. They have to approve them manually so it takes time for them to get though the que.
