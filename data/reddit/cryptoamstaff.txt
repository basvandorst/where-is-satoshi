however you won't have to fear physical harm from carrying a box of well packed drugs. and the one getting harmed are most likely the ones that ordered the drugs.

isn't marketcap = price x number of available tokens? not sure if that's a good metric to use for a cryptocurrency comparison. 
edit:  I like the system of  as it takes a number of other metrics into account too.

the only DAO I'm looking forward to :) keep up the great work bitsquare gang!

true, but since this is a (according to title) leaked and later again updated version we might see some actual signing when/if an official version of this is released.
