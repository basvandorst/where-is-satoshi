All I have to say is good fucking luck. [Uberjumper]( has been trying to help his friend cash out since **October** and still hasn't found a method yet.
Here is the rest of his update following that post regarding **Localbitcoins.com**
Pretty much all the methods of payment on localbitcoins are ether unsafe, or terrible from what i can tell. The two exceptions are cash (we know how well that worked out), or a cash deposit (pretty massive pain in the ass), which both are pretty inconvenient.
However localbitcoins lists some other payment methods, and ranks them on "low", "medium", or "high" risk. The low risk includes well known and "trustworthy" payment services like EGOPay, OkPay, and Perfect Money. Ironically there is also Western Union, a service which bitcoiners declared bitcoin will kill off. The funny part is, nobody uses the low risk payment methods really, because they are all a massive pain in the ass.
Pretty much all the people on Localbitcoins (and there really is not very many in Canada, less than 200 including people who have not logged on in a month), want you to use something like e-transfers, wire transfers, paypal, etc. Which are all not safe at all. Since one party can cry fraud and boom, you loose your money and they walk off with the bitcoins. Well obviously the best solution is to let your feedback/reputation dictate if your a scammer or not. I see this everywhere:






You can see the issues here.
Okay, I'll use **OKPay** then... oh wait *OKPay does not allow people to use their service for selling crypto-currencies*? 


If you look around there is some nice whining from people that OKPay has cancelled and closed their accounts for selling bitcoins. But you know, its "low risk".
**Perfect Money**: A virtual wallet service, that nobody seems to use. You need to make an account, get verified, get the money into your account, then wait 3-5 days for the transaction to be approved they also apparently do not allow you to withdraw all your money in one shot and you must keep a minimum balance of 300$ at all times. Also from what i can gather the only way to send money is by sending someone an e-voucher. There is no way to verify the value of an e-voucher, nor is there a way to reverse it. So of course this means that all the buyers want you to send them the bitcoins first then they will send you the voucher and not disappear. Apparently only 3 people on localbitcoins is willing to use this method. 
**Ego Pay**: Some sort of virtual online wallet service. Requires you to become verified to withdraw money from there. Also there is some really sketchy stuff in their terms and conditions:


Would selling bitcoin count as an e-currency exchanger? I don't know i can't find a single post about someone using EGOPay. However the single most stupid thing about Ego Pay is:


So let me get this straight, Ego Pay doesn't even let you withdraw money to your bank account. You need to withdraw it to another FUCKING SITE? Don't forget no fees*(only 2.5% for deposit/withdrawal). 
So? **Bitcoin -&gt; Localbitcoins -&gt; Ego Pay -&gt; Payza -&gt; Bank -&gt; Fiat**
**Western Union**: Aside from the fact that all of the buyers expect you to be responsible for 7% fee even though they are already paying you much less than the "actual" price (aka whatever exchange has the highest price, bitcoiners claim thats the value of bitcoins). There are only 38 users willing to buy, and only 18 of them have logged into localbitcoins in the last 7 days. **Furthermore, some of the buyers will not deal with you for western union UNLESS you send them the coins FIRST**. Aka no escrow.


I am sorry i simply cannot trust people on localbitcoins when the entirety of their forum consists of users crying about getting scammed, by people who are supposed to be reputable. I love how bitcoiners dance between "DONT TRUST ANYONE", to "trust me with your 20,000$ exchange, i swear i won't scam you cause i have a whole 20 feedback". 
Don't you guys see how great and simple these "low" risk methods are? Honestly buying and selling bitcoin has never been easier.
Good fucking luck is all I have to say.
