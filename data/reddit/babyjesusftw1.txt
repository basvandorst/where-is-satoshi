What ship is going down? 1,400% gains on the year for bitcoin, so you must not be talking about the bitcoin ship

I'm confused about your reasons for investing then. Why do you need to wait a couple months to make a few bucks if you're working?

Bitcoin is not the kind of investment where you'll safely make any money. If anything, bitcoin is more unstable now than it has been in a long time, so it's possible you'll lose money if you invest now. I'd try doing something else like peer tutoring to make some reliable extra income

Don't cancel a payment simply because the changing rates didn't go in your favor. You're dealing with a legitimate business. If you ate at a restaurant, would you dispute the credit card bill simply because you found a better deal for the same food at another restauarant?

If you're not even old enough to work a full-time job, then you shouldn't be investing any money into things you know nothing about.

There's no way you can farm bitcoin with just a $100 investment. Shady is the key word here. He's definitely trying to take your money. Avoid this scammer at all cost.

Been using it for ages now on my android phone. I really like it.

How exactly is an investment in bitcoin "lost money"? You do realize the price can go back up right?
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:41:33
you will always ask this "should I wait" question until you nut up and buy. Just fucking do it

I informed them of the double spend error and that this transaction will never confirm, so we'll see what happens next. Thank you for your help

They'll list items for a fiat price, and then the amount of bitcoin required to pay for the item will be determined at checkout. They're not gonna list products with bitcoin values. Every site that accepts bitcoin calculates the bitcoin/usd exchange rate at the time of checkout.

i just received $400 in bitcoins. I think he sent your bitcoin to me instead
