You do you man.  I have a store of value that can never be frozen or stolen (if properly managed) and I can give this to anyone on the planet with an internet connection whenever I want.  If you do not see value in that you should probably stick with radio, gas lamps, and horses.

Its not helpful for anyone who bought in after.  Its irrelevant.  
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:46:32
Lol as long as the HODLers are willing to sell at that price nothing you can do.  You only lose money when you sell lower than you bought it.  Considering it went from 1k to 20k in 1 fucking year, lots of people can still make a profit and they are choosing to.

Its just FUD a way to control crypto.  The rules are so convoluted that everyone is guilty of doing it wrong so if the IRS wanted to they could create a case against anyone.  No one can use crypto if the results are huge fines and possible jail time is just a tactic they are trying to implement.  If I have to fill out paperwork and do math every time I wanted to buy a cheeseburger with some crypto this would obviously become a problem.  Only makes me want to fight that much harder for it.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:39:09
Oh so they hired more people.  Good they can figure it out and send me a bill.

Alt coins are in the light since bitcoin has too many problems.  It is really hard to invest in bitcoin right now either for ROI or the technology.  
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:24:57
Yah what happened?
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:44:31
That power would most likely have been wasted regardless.  Instead people are using it cheap.  
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:55:55
If bitcoin dies they all die unless it does something of value.  If the market is just jump from one cheap alt to the next that is not very useful long term.

The point I like that Roger made is that if we have mass adoption before anyone can react no one can retroactively react if it is mainstream.  Bcash is still a scam but his logic on that issue is not wrong.

With that logic wouldn't anyone participating in a trading card game be liable for tax evasion as value is constantly being changed.  I asked this question yesterday.  As long as you arent converting it to fiat and we aren't talking about millions it probably wont matter.  
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:27:19
I don't understand BCC if bitcoin goes down you can sure as shit know BCC is dead as well.  Crypto enthusiasts would go to another alt before they would touch bitcoin anything again.  
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:07:17
Visa is easy to use...  You are missing the point of bitcoin its the most secured accurate form of decentralized payment.  You cant compare bitcoin to a company its an open-source project much akin to the internet.  And like the internet it is in the very early dial up or even before that stages of speed.

@_date: 2017-12-21 20:46:26
Transfer it to Gdax and send it from Gdax.  Coinbase owns Gdax and you can send it off gdax to any address for free.  On Gdax hit the deposit button and it will give you the option to deposit from your coinbase account. After it shows up on Gdax just hit send and send it to whatever address you want.
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:31:09
Thank you for the explanation.  I enjoy learning more about crypto everyday.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:51:57
The best you can do is control it at the banks and US exchanges. If everyone had their bitcoin and couldn't trade it to Fiat they would want to store it or use it.  Thus fulfilling its destiny as a currency.  Trying to regulate bitcoin only makes it stronger.  Ie Taxing bitcoin or trying to control it.  If not else I will have a very nice vacation in Japan in 5-10 years paid in full with bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:59:24
If it's ever worth that much it's probably not an asset anymore and just a currency.  At this point, you can just spend it directly.

Why would you send it to a non-segwit address anyway.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:46:45
Maybe some do maybe some don't.  Its not hard to see it posted all over the place.  Mine is in a trezor and if the price were to plummet I would not pay the heavy fees to get it back to an exchange to sell for pennies.  "I" do not religiously check the price because I am all or nothing with bitcoin so it doesn't matter. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:30:45

It probably is a bubble or in need of some correction.  The weak hands get played every time.  People have been using crypto currency to buy shit from other countries on the internet for years it has its uses.  To think crypto currency and block chain technology is just going to go away, is like betting against a world changing innovation.  When does that actually happen?  I mean seriously in the last 20 years what technology was around that promised to change the world but didn't get adopted.

Its a work in progress.  So much hype around it.  If you believe in the tech the best thing to do is get enough where you are comfortable if you lost it and just hide it in a wallet for some time.  I wouldn't use bitcoin for transactions at this time.  Other alt coins if people accept them will work but only because they are not as popular as btc.    
@_date: 2017-12-29 20:14:58
I noticed the same thing.  So many things I don't like and do like, but I don't see so much negativity about Ice cream or some shit.  If you don't like bitcoin no one is forcing anyone to adopt/use it or even invest in it for that manner.  I don't have cable news nor do I hear anyone talk about it at work or on social media.  Well then again I don't really have friends.

This is a really cool technology and social experiment altogether.  
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:39:41
I am not going to not pay a bill if the IRS comes a knocking.  However since I haven't converted it to fiat I am not worried.  Will they know if I purchased a video game on overstock, doubtful.  Bitcoin has been around a while I don't have a record of all my coins/crypto gifts.  I am curious to see how the IRS is going to tackle this issue.  I mean you want to make "every" transaction a taxable event call it a currency or not, it seems like a losing battle.  
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:05:32
So the speculative technology of bitcoin is only good if very few people know or use it?  I don't understand.  Well I hope you do sell.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:13:24
Well I am not smart so I guess I will just hold onto my btc.  You mean this innovative social experiment is just going to "DIE" like a poof or something.  Every engineer and crypto enthusiast is just going to give up at the same time.

Its a bubble now I thought it was a bubble a year ago, two years ago, three years ago, see where I am going with this.  BITCOIN was a bubble since it started.  After a while and using bitcoin you get more comfortable.  Things have value because we give them value and a community has given bitcoin value.  Why are some of my revised magic cards worth more than others.  The reason why my parents could never figure that out is the same reason they cant figure out why bitcoin has value.  If you are only investing in something where your entire goal is to flip for a profit quickly.  Yah I can see why people are chicken shits, its gambling.

I agree but you also miss the point.  You pay taxes by converting large amounts to fiat which is also against bitcoin, if "Fiat is dead".  Are you in this for the new paradigm or just to make a quick buck.  If you are in it to just make a quick buck, I hope the government forces your hands with taxes.  It only legitimizes hodling.
I kind of agree with you but for different reasons.  If people actually used btc in transactions and the IRS didn't have the ability to govern this.  It would only legitimize it as being considered a currency instead of an asset.

@_date: 2017-12-14 21:02:55
Bitcoin was cool when I could buy a little, it grew over time and I ended up buying a video-game on steam for essentially less.  The price could very well be inflated because of massive FOMO.  However the technology it "potentially" offers being able to transfer portions of your wealth very quickly over the internet through a decentralized means is a very valuable thing for some.  Bitcoin is not there right now, but it could easily be worth 100k to 1mil if you just learn the technology.  If you are looking to get rich quick, I agree this is not the investment for you.  A new technology that does work, granted being overloaded this last year, is very different than trying to invest in shitty .com companies or buying houses to only flip for profit.  You cant equate these things.  You can compare fomo of shitcoins and shitty .com companies but the technology from the internet did change the world and many massive companies exist because of it.  Who the hell bets against innovation, mother fucking dinosaurs that's who.

If everything you do with crypto is taxable and millions more people get into crypto good luck regulating that nonsense.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:30:18
The money he spent on buying btc was probably already taxed.  Lets just say for the sake of argument that in the future the price of bitcoin is actually fairly stable.  I buy some and when I use the btc to purchase something online the price changes by .01 cents.  You really expect me to do the tax work on every transaction that's +/- .01 cents different.  What if in the future I plan on spending my Btc in japan on a vacation and not take out any Japanese fiat.  What if I exchange some fiat and it grows in value over a week and exchange it back to USD do I have to report the taxes on those profits?  BTC at this time is treated as an asset only and not a currency so it really is just best to hodl.

Because people are “using” the currency as intended to bring about adoption Jesus Christ.  The price would not have done what it has done if people only held onto it like a collectible.

The biggest test for bitcoin.  When 99% are struggling why not just adopt a "fair" centralized coin.  Can Bitcoin beat the FedCoin? This will be the question.  
Edit: I will expand on this.
you wouldn't ban or regulate bitcoin now.  You want the world to be excited and comfortable with using "digital currency".  Once the adoption rate is high and people are left out you introduce the fedcoin and ban bitcoin and that is when the war's start (think the reasons for the death of Saddam and Ghadafi.)  Bitcoin is the answer but people don't always follow logic and reasoning, and just because it is correct, doesn't mean it will stick if faced with crazy intervention.  Both the right and left in the US are very totalitarian in their thinking.  If Bitcoin is blamed for the growing inequality and the reason the world's economy is crashing it wouldn't be hard to think people would support the killing of miners and users in the streets.  If your family is starving and they convince you that it's because of "bitcoin" what would people really think.  This is taking it to the extreme but not that crazy.

Its not going to fail.  Just capitulate so we can get over the selling.  When you finally do the market will flatline for up to a year and in this time every 10 minutes a block will be mined.  Transactions will still go through on DNM's business as usual.  People will see this again and you will fomo back in at 20k.  Id rather it be cheap so I can get more ive been on the sidelines waiting.

Well they should its game theory. Btc is a better vehicle to increase your wealth.  Others see this and it snowballs.

I bought BTC at 3.1 and transferred to a hardware wallet.  I'll buy more if we go down further as long as they let me buy cheaply and transfer to cold storage I'm happy.

My profile is described in Sats.  But guess what bitcoin becomes overvalued as well as undervalued.  When the community becomes gay I dump on you, when it's good again 80% down I buy more.

I'd be bullish but known Pump and dumps and exit scams are still pumping harder.  That is not how you end a bear market.  Now if the rally holds until Baakt or ETFS and they get approved that could possibly be bullish and the ponzi continues!!!! The "Bull" market starts and BTC loses dominance that doesn't make any sense.  Getting back to 6k and letting those who bought there get out with minimal losses as we start to go back down is important. This creates the anger at BTC.  Just keep your chin up and look forward to 2020.  Be happy that this shit can finally purge because in the end only BTC will stand.

If I can get some in the 1k to 3k range and by 2024 or 2 halvings from now, this is worth just 5k or 6k it was a great investment.
