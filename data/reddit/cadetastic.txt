The headline is probably wrong.  The article says the US government is requesting extradition, which means he was arrested and is being held by Thailand's government.

That's wrongly assuming that countries are killing people to get to their money.   That is simply not why countries kill people.  Governments kill people to quash dissent and maintain power, not to get access to bank accounts.  Governments may take the funds of dead victims, but they would still kill victims even if they were destitute.   
Furthermore,  if a country was willing to kill someone for money, then there would be no qualms about torturing them until they gave of access to their bitcoin.

So the only real benefit is that the government can't take your bitcoin without your assistance,  unlike your bank account?    
But as you pointed out the government can still lock you up for refusing to pay.   It could also take your house and car, and garnish your wages.  I fail to see how mass adoption of bitcoin would change the tax system.  People would still owe taxes, the government would still be able to figure out who owes it money, and in the end the government will generally get what it is owed.

A lot of the analysis disagrees on whether he did or didn't want the voters to vote for austerity, so I guess I'm not convinced either way.  But I'm sure we can both agree that the referendum was really just a sideshow, and the PM was always willing to ignore it.

Well, he publicly campaigned against accepting austerity.  


If he wanted the voters to vote yes I think he would have campaigned for a yes vote, or at least abstained from taking any position on it.  But I admit it is possible he was simply lying about his position on the issue.

No, the PM wanted the voters to vote no to austerity.  He thought a solid no referendum would give him extra leverage in negotiations.  He specifically asked voters to vote no, but in the end it didn't give him any real extra bargaining power: 
Edit: eh, looking into it further I'll admit it was possible he was false about his support for the no vote. Honestly not convinced which argument to subscribe to.

You're seriously advocating borrowing massive amounts of money to invest in Bitcoin?  Can't tell if you're retarded, or a troll.

Shouldn't be too hard to accomplish, seeing as OP is a captain of industry.

Hate speech is protected in the United States.  The courts have been clear in ruling that there is no "hate speech" exception to the First Amendment.

Sadly I don't think you're being sarcastic.
