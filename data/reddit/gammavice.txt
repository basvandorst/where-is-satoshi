situations absolutely drive action more than personal will does. any rational individual should be able to arrive at this conclusion.
I believe the US government took issue with SR not because of the illegal drug trade, but because of the ideology that was the life force behind it. 
The sheer number of individuals who blatantly said "fuck you" to the US government by participating in the marketplace had to of been unsettling to them... An online free market based on a somewhat anonymous, new cryptocurrency that circumvents any taxation or state interference?
Come on. Anybody who still thinks SR's seizure and Ross's arrest was truly about "drugs" and the government's concern for its citizens wellbeing is a bit off the mark in my opinion... If that was the case, the US wouldn't still be fighting its "war on drugs" - a war best outlined as failed ironically by SR's own creation and popularity. (not to mention the fairly numerous, still operational DNM's out there)

It's easy to pick apart the mistakes made my Ross early on, but you have to realize that even a few years ago OPSEC wasn't anywhere near up to par in comparison today.... PGP wasn't even used initially on the marketplace, man...

Like I said, it's easy to second guess the actions of others in hindsight.
Realistically you don't know what you would do in that situation. You have to factor in the reality that he probably had a rather inflated ego from running the biggest anonymous black market the Internet has ever known. He probably felt slightly untouchable. Most people who get to the level he did probably experience something similar.
