Yes - 100 is hardly a high bar!
It is fair to say, though, that the only thing an IQ test truly accurately measures is someone's IQ.

Nations moved off the gold standard in the early 20th century; technologically it was no longer needed, its value - based mainly upon scarcity - remains. 
In the same way, nations may well move off the fiat standard in the 21st century.
But value is not, and never has been, directly tied to utility. 
Gold (and silver's) utility was already failing when people realised you could trim coins back in Roman times.  You can't 'trim' BTC.
Anyway, this is worthy of a discussion much longer than can be conducted here.  So all I shall say is: Hodl, and to the Moooon!!!

Strange shit happening around Bcash.  
It is completely discredited, and widely distrusted.  
Day trader friends of mine are extremely cautious of it.  But it pumps.  A relatively cheap coin, so more easy to manipulate than BTC I guess.  ASIC miners hold hundreds of thousands of this shitcoin that they can't release to the market.  If they all sold, the price would crash to its real value - 100 USD.
I don't like to sound like one of the Bcash conspiratorial sock-puppets, but I honestly believe that the entire crypto space would be healthier if that nasty lying coin died - but someone is keeping it alive.

As I've said, utility is only a part of it.  
I am extremely optimistic about BTC's capability to scale and become a highly convenient means of payment.

Gold has almost no utility.

But you are assuming, naively, that Economics 101 is 'What is the value of something?'   And that at the end of that simple lecture, all is resolved.
In fact the value of something is a far more complex and complicated concept than this - and something whose definition has evaded economists since the creation of that discipline.

Don't worry about alts - most are wanky and strange and shite in the medium to long term.

The 'general public' know jack-shit about crypto.  
In fact, with an average IQ of a worrying, but definitional, 100, the public are rather jack-shitless generally.
Your 'general public' pumped the price to an unsustainable level in a state of pure ignorance at the end of 2017 - but more importantly, at an unsustainable rate.

Transfer a small amount to it.  Go through all the security.  Write down your seed words and any password or pin hints.  Then make sure that after a reset (see the manual) you can restore your wallet and recover those funds using that seed.

Agreed.  
But there are sides to anarchy/libertarianism.  
Some are extreme left, some extreme right.  e.g.  
Far left: it belongs to everyone, so I will steal it.  
Far right: it belongs to no-one, so I will steal it!  
I suspect Bcash falls into the extreme right - a capitalist form - although Ver's followers are probably not aware of that.

Here's a nice *extremis* argument surrounding scarcity: a Van Gogh painting sold at 24,000,000  USD.
Sure, Van Gogh was a unique painter, but what is the utility of that painting?
Second, let's assume it **does** have utility as a work of beauty and history; is its 24 million price tag worth 240,000 times that of a perfect 100 dollar reproduction?
It's value is partly emotional - but mainly due to scarcity.  He had a meagre output.  If Van Gogh had painted 100,000 works, they would each be worth jack-shit :)
*Edit: arithmetic*
@_date: 2018-05-06 09:37:59
Agreed.  There is short term and long term.
Would any serious investor put substantial money or resources, long term, into something that is provably dishonest, with a track record of deception?

2)  Is Gold or BTC a better store of value or a better means of exchange?
Well, BTC is very volatile - but the volatility trends upwards - so that's part of the appeal :)
Regarding means of exchange: 
Consider this: if you have 10k's worth of gold under your bed, and wish to sell it - at the current 'market price' - How do you do that?  Think about it.  Where do you take it to sell it?  Fact is, you can't.  (Except maybe at a Cash for Gold type place, or some Gold scrap dealer, or on the black market, where you will lose 30-50% of its 'value.')
If you have 10k worth of BTC in your wallet, where can you exchange that? - hundreds of places, for a small percentage fee.
Sermon over.

A few months is ample time to verify yourself with an exchange and convert to fiat, if that is your intention.
Alternatively, if you want to pass the BTC on to someone else, provide your seed words somewhere minus the last one or two words, and ensure the person you want to inherit only has those final parts to the seed.  It's not a huge sum, so probably no need for excessive security beyond that.

It is odd, because 'lose' as it is spelt should really rhyme with, say, 'close' - but as you know, English spelling isn't at all logical.  
Another confusion is lead (v), led (past tense of lead), lead (noun, the metal), the first and last spelt identically but pronounced differently.  
And then we have 'spelt' and 'spelled' - well the jury is out on that one :)
@_date: 2018-06-21 14:09:10
1) No, the value of the remaining would go up to compensate.
2) I don't think BTC *can* be divided to less than 1 sat.
Even if it could, you are close to restating Zeno's paradox: just because something can be infinitely divided, does not mean that its value grows in the process!  I can slice a pie a trillion times - it is still one pie :)

@_date: 2018-06-22 18:57:34
A really sensible analysis.
The mathematical mean here is, obviously, rather hard to define!
But fading away?  As the World leader in cryptocurrencies, that would require the entire technology to fail, or be shown to be valueless.  I think that is extremely unlikely.
The other alternative is that BTC is overtaken by some other coin - but that again is extremely unlikely, given the lack of trust in other cryptos.
I think trust will be the key to it.  So IMO the 'fade away' eventuality has a very low probability.
Trust will win out - sorry Roger.

@_date: 2018-06-06 17:43:31
The entire market is silly.  There is only a handful - if that - of proper coins.  But shitcoins are still getting pumped, and you see some unsustainable rises in shitcoins.  No doubt some of that investment (which is pure speculation - or closer to gambling) is transferred from BTC.  
That pumping isn't necessarily the mythical whales - it is people trying to make a buck, who have no medium or long term interest in XCoin, or ArseCoin - or indeed Rogercoin aka Bcash - and why shouldn't they?
This is prob. why some shitcoins rise absurdly, while BTC rises a little.
But then everyone realises they are investing in shitcoins, the little bubble bursts, the market corrects, and BTC rises again as everyone comes back into the fold.
BTC is suffering that, essentially, IMO.
In the long run it will be fine - but until people stop putting dollars or their BTC into 'TittyCoin' or 'BeerCoin' or 'WankCoin', this will continue.
Just need to be patient.

3.  If the technology is here to stay, but is not generally trusted, what is the future?  BTC (and arguably XMR) are the only fully decentralised and trusted assets.

You can only know that there is a bus behind through:

Altcoins deserve holding down!  They ought to be holding themselves down naturally!  98% of them are shitcoins.  Without investment into BTC the vast majority of them would be worth zero.
Get real!
Do you think a semi-functional scam coin like Bcash, for example, would be worth more than 20 USD without BTC?
There is a small handful of coins with genuine utility, security and trusted technology - the other 1000+ are close to worthless.
JMHO :)

Er, AC current is inherently no more dangerous than DC current of the equivalent voltage.  
But the principle behind using AC is to transmit it at a very high voltage but low current for reduction in energy losses as heat; it then being stepped down in voltage at the end of transmission by transformers for the end user.  (Transformers only work with AC current.)

Look guys, forget all the crappy analogies, Bitcoin is female.
Completely unpredictable, irrational and mutable.  It's price is as random as the path a pretty lady takes around a clothes shop.
But, just like a lady, Bitcoin can surprise us.
She can be miserable &amp; moody for weeks on end, for no apparent reason (hey, maybe you left your pants on the floor?  Who knows?)
But then, suddenly, she is back again - radiant, standing at the sink doing the washing up, wearing nothing but her high heels and rubber gloves, jiggling her bottom, flicking her hair over her shoulder and winking at you.
That, gentlemen, is Bitcoin.
I hope you understand now.

@_date: 2018-06-24 09:14:19
It is just that you can't disinvent technologies.  Cryptocurrencies are here to stay, and Bitcoin is the most trusted and proven one.
So the logic follows: if Bitcoin fails, an entire technology is abandoned.  The likelihood of that is close to zero.
The entire market, however, is a mess.  Anyone with any critical sense can see that.  There are hundreds of random, valueless coins - with no discernable new technology to offer - making gains of hundreds of percent overnight - that is completely unsustainable. 
So in that sense, there probably needs to be a 'crisis' like this to shake out all that nonsense.  The market has been pregnant for that culling for months.
My only real change in view since Jan 2018 is that the timescale for recovery may be longer than expected.

Would that be a long term vision?  BTC is not only the leading and established coin - it looks to the future, and is solving scaling problems imaginatively and long term - not relying upon short term hacks.
To moan about BTC dominance is akin to the captain of a ship complaining about the existence of the sea.
@_date: 2018-06-15 22:19:11
Observe the market: genuine coins (there is only a handful) temporarily suffer.
With the slightest upward movement, shitcoins get pumped by tens of percentage points within hours.
The market is still dominated by opportunism and shitcoins - so it is ripe for manipulation.
The day the market pumps (and it is always BTC behind the pump) and BTC rises as fast as the shitcoins - that is when the market has been shaken out of crap.
This will take some time, lady and gentlemen.

I am not saying they are all scams: some are scams, some are not.

Yes, you can see effects on inflation when new coin age is introduced or removed.  For example, a half cent removed from circulation.  This generally leads to prices being rounded up rather than down.

**Whales, miners &amp; the Illuminati**
Even whales had to buy their BTC at some price.   At the current price point they would be losing money, or facing a severe opportunity cost, by dumping on the market.
I've never been convinced by the whales theory.
Miners, on the other hand, may have only been selling the BTC they need to cover their mining costs, and sensibly hodling the rest, over a long period of time, as an investment.  Running costs aside - these are zero price BTC.
It is far more likely that what we are seeing is miners offloading coins.  It may, therefore, be temporary.
Regarding the Illuminati - it's got fuck all to do with daft conspiracies like that, that was just for fun.

@_date: 2018-06-14 17:23:51
A passing thought:
I'm not convinced by all the whale arguments.  Shitcoins and a foolish young market are mostly to blame.
I guarantee that what is happening right now during this minor (but very welcome) green, is folks thinking - 'BTC has gone up, but look at the price of TittyXCoin, it's soaring!  I'll put some into that.'
So they skim some of their BTC into another worthless shitcoin, and the BTC price declines due to sales.
This is why I just sit back, and wait for all these shitcoins to die off naturally.
(and that includes you Roger - but you're smart, and it may take some time for people to wise up.)

Yeah.  
Bcash's solution is a lazy one - driven more by one man's contempt and frustration, than by any technological innovation.
I do think, though, that had BTC increased the blocksize a bit to head this off, whilst working on LN, it might have been avoided.
But I can also appreciate the purist arguments behind BTC's collective decision.
There seems little intellectual or philosophical purity behind Bcash's attempts to patch, whilst misleading and destroying.
Bcash will fall between two stools - neither fast, nor - more importantly - ever trusted.

When Bcash dies, BTC and the handful of other honest coins within our crypto space will recover.
I sincerely hope Mr Ver understands the damage he has done.
p.s.  Lightning Network and BTCC must have him worried.  Oh, and BTW, don't forget that he was always a supporter of 2nd layer solutions until it, er, didn't suit him.
He's rather quiet these days - but he posted a tweet from a Japanese lady (who promotes his Bcash events in Japan) about her paying for a meal with Bcash (in Japan).  
Come back to America Mr Ver !

1.  You're simply paraphrasing economist JM Keynes.
2.  BTC *is* the gold standard.  10,000 shitcoins doesn't negate that; in fact it makes a gold standard even more important.
There may be some value in your ideas, but they are not new, and are easily contestable.
It never ceases to surprise me how people come on these boards and advise us of matters that we have considered, and known about, and discussed for years :)

You've been on REDDIT a long time.  But mainly contributing to political forums.
Your attacks on BTC have been pretty consistent for a long time - and you've stated that you are 'in the red' despite being 'a wise investor.'
Basically, you've invested a little in BTC, lost some money, and made it your mission to FUD, based upon your own experience.
We all know the price has declined - so what's your message?
And for you to call other contributors 'cry babies' is pretty ironic !
Bitter FUDer  :)

How is your altcoin portfolio doing?

You can't realistically mine BTC as an individual.  One nice thing about the recently hacked shitcoin called Bitcoin Gold (they're cool - because they don't pretend to be Bitcoin) is that apparently it is more mineable by individuals.  Have a look at that.  BTG.)

You know full well that they are always doing that, in a cycle.
The fact that TittyCoin is up 60% on the week is really of no significance, when it is down 65% the next week.
But if chaps like you can profit from it, good luck to you.
(But - you don't profit do you?  Because it is essentially gambling on horses you don't believe in.  I think you personally sold your BTC and went into alts, and you are watching your portfolio diminish.  That is why you are always here, looking for justification.)

Every technology has its pros and cons.  Decentralised block chain transactions can never (in their basic state) be super rapid or highly scalable - it is just the nature of the beast.
Bcash has simply put a sticking plaster (and a pretty unimaginative one at that) over a serious wound.
The Lightning Network is a brilliant, imaginative solution.  I'm absolutely confident that it is the icing on BTC's cake.

There are a number of ways of estimating the value of BTC.  Comparing it with gold is one way.  Nobody really knows.
If you imagine BTC eventually achieved the same market cap as gold, then that figure divided by 21 million would give one indication of value of 1 BTC, as there will never be more than 21 million in circulation.
Alternatively, you could speculate that BTC could be responsible for, say, 1% of World trade transactions, and use that figure.
Who knows? :)

You're not going to like this much.  But I blame a lot of these problems on Ver's lying Bcash project and the doubt and confusion it has caused.
BCash is now perilously close to the psychological barrier of being worth less than 0.10000000 BTC.
When that happens, the ASIC miners will panic and sell their Bcash holdings, Bcash's price will collapse and trust me - we will again see erect green dildo's all over the charts - led by BTC.

Malta was destroyed by a small asteroid in 2005, but completely rebuilt in 2006 with the aid of an EU concrete grant.
The national flag of Malta is the only one to feature a banana, even though bananas are not grown or traded by Malta
In 1656, every Maltese person died of the plague, and the island was repopulated by a family from Catford, London.  Hence their cockney accents and support of London football teams.
The entire island, despite being an island, is 100m below sea level.
If Malta were removed from the Med. geologists agree the entire sea would drain, as Malta acts as a huge geological 'plug'.  The water would drain into New York.
Journalists occasionally get murdered in Malta.

I'll just say this: 
I think that the whole Ver Bcash lying fiasco has been far more insidious and damaging than anyone could realise. 
But the damage has been his only achievement. 
And now that that lie is on its knees, with Bcash being removed from exchanges, and struggling to maintain 0.10 BTC, we may start to see some recovery in the crypto space.
@_date: 2018-03-31 19:17:41

On the one occasion he was asked about selling and buying BTC and BCash, he was caught out lying.  What he stated on camera directly contradicted what he had written on Reddit.
He will cash out his BCash in the face of Lightning Network if he has any sense.  And he is no fool.

On a historical-religious-economic note, on this Easter Sunday:
Judas only accepted 30 pieces of silver to give the whereabouts of Jesus to the temple authorities and their Roman guards.  That's probably 30 silver coins.
That's not worth a *huge* amount today, and probably worth even less then when precious metals were a common currency and the initial supply was large.
So it was probably the equivalent of - guestimate - 150-200 Dollars - enough to buy some clothes.
I wonder what shitcoin Judas would accept today?

Economics doesn't help with cryptocurrency.  
It really doesn't.
It is 
1)  Completely new and without precedent
2)  Due to a lack of regulation (which may be a good or bad thing) completely impenetrable by the normal rules of economics
So, in short, no economist worth his wage has a fucking clue about the value, future, or prospects of cryptocurrencies.

Here's a history of Ver's team's attempts at brand stealing and confusion using Bcash as I see it:
* Launched as Bitcoin Cash
* Reasonably, and even affectionately, became known as Bcash
* Ver throws a wobbly - he *must* retain Bitcoin in the name for his stealing strategy to work.
* Ver takes it a step further, attempts to rebrand Bcash as Bitcoin
* That was a step too far: the cognitive dissonance is so hard to reconcile that even Bcash supporters get confused
* Ver changes tack, and attempts to rename Bitcoin itself.  Referring to it, incorrectly, as Bitcoin Core.
We appear to be at the final stage.  But the lying project is dying, and Bcash is struggling to reach 10% of BTC's value.
Game over.

The fact is that Wright doesn't understand any of that mathematics.  
It is all lifted.  
In his lectures he refers to the maths as 'squiggles' - that amounts to the limits of his understanding.
There are easily defined and well understood parameters in crypto, including gamma, which takes values strictly between zero and 1. 
Only a mathematical sharlatan could claim it may have negative values.
Over in the Bcash other-world they have attempted to explain this - with more shitty maths - of course any quantity may have a negative *change*.
Enough - the man is a charlatan.

Contrary to the misunderstandings of Ver and Co., liquidity is not a measure of value.  Gold has almost zero liquidity in the real world.
This is the huge mistake (among many others) made by Bcash.
But with the LN network, BTC will not only be a trusted, and decentralised universal store of value, it will also be liquid and fungible.
This is why it is the currency of the future and is - although valuable now - severely undervalued at the present time.

It's not necessarily binary.  Some of it may be true, most of it may be false, half may be true - etc.  But I think it is mainly nonsense.
You know, a lot of that pump was genuinely consumer driven.  People were mortgaging their houses and taking out huge loans to buy Bitcoin.  BTC itself isn't a bubble, but within that Nov/Dec time-frame it was.
Sometimes I'd drive into work and, on paper, had earned thousands of dollars in 20 minutes - that simply couldn't sustain.

There is no president of the US in recent history, or living memory, who has been bankrupted.  Not only once, but numerous times.
I'll let it go.  But it is a matter of fact and something to consider, because bankruptcies hurt a lot of innocent people.  To emerge unscathed from them may well be legal, but it is hard to see it as moral.

I don't want to sound conspiratorial - so shout me down if you wish.  But is this to do with Bcash?
Miners hold thousands of failing Bcash.  ASICs also hit badly by XMR.
Are they exchanging their BCH for BTC (and other coins) and dumping?
It's a potential way to do it without completely crashing the Bcash value.
Edit: clarification
@_date: 2018-04-03 09:01:39
Yes, it seems to be a way to conduct transactions without the blockchain - which kind of misses the whole point!  Maybe it is ok for buying coffee?  It's being pushed by the Bcashers as some kind of innovation :)  Desperation I suppose in the face of LN.

There are around 10^80 atoms in the known universe.  So assuming 100,000 million galaxies, 10^72 is the number of atoms in 1000 galaxies.

Financial elites could mess with the currency a lot, but conspiracies assume some sort of co-ordinated effort - and I don't think that is happening.  Market forces and tech will decide BTC's fate.

You take the average of prices going back over a time-span, and it gives a general trend of price change.  Essentially, they produce smoother trend curves than all the zig-zagging up and down you see minute to minute or hour to hour.
Problem is, you can run your averages over different timescales. 
So over weeks, the MA may show a general upward trend, although over hours or days the price is crashing!

Lightning is a quite brilliant concept - it is only Ver's lying tossers who are critical of it.
(Ver, BTW, was all in favour of LN, until he decided he would make himself richer by scamming the community with Bcash.)

The price is once again in that strange (for BTC) very narrow range moving sideways.
These are odd times.  I haven't seen this trend before.  No gradual decline or rise or the usual oscillations.
It is either going to be huge red or green dildos.

If the quantum computer is attempting to brute force, there is still time required to do it, but rather than that time exponentially increasing with the number of inputs, it's my understanding that the time required is proportional to the square root of the number of inputs.
I guess this means that, for example, if you went from a 24 word seed to a 25 word seed, binary computers would take 2000 times longer to brute force it, but since sqrt 25 is very close to sqrt 24, it wouldn't make much difference to a quantum computer.

MA's are pretty simple, because people in finance are not that sophisticated (controversial!)
But let's say you take a ten day MA.  You average the price over the last ten days today, and plot it on a chart.  Tomorrow is a new day, so you average over the previous 10 days (dropping the one 11 days ago, and take a new simple average again.)
As you can imagine, this smooths out all the wiggles very nicely.
But precisely which timescale you choose, and how may periods of that chosen timescale you average over - well - that is for the (alleged) experts.  :)
Personally, being a VERY long term hodler, I like the log graph for BTC over all time (or since about 2011.)

Gold / silver are quite interesting, because you can't actually buy ANYTHING with them.
Sure, you can trade them on markets, and they have some (limited) industrial uses.
But if I bought 100g of gold, and had it in my pocket, there is almost nothing I can do with it.  No trader will buy it for the 'market' price.  No-one really wants to barter with it - because they couldn't spend it either.
I'd have to take it to some 'cash for gold'  trader, and there I could finally monetise it for fiat - but with a 30-50% loss.
BTC really is much better than gold.  It is far more saleable.

Meanwhile, over on the naughty step:
What are Jihan and Ver's miners going to do with those tens of thousands of Bcash tokens they've been earning and holding?   (Releasing them would collapse their own price.  And you even buy the mining rigs with Bcash you know!)
They have already agreed amongst themselves to 'burn' some to boost 'uptake' (read: 'price')
Although that might in itself be a lie and a marketing strategy.
There is also the hardfork of Bcash coming - but many wallets and exchanges are unprepared.  And some people think it is one of those hardforks with free coins - nope.  Nothing free.  No 1:1.  Just a slightly new version of the scam coin.
Someone is bleeding BTC and other assets to boost that lying coin.  It can't last - it is starting to collapse already.

If you're going to buy in - then just buy in.  You could wait forever for a 5% dip that may never happen.
When I bought my BTC 4 or 5 years ago, I just bought them - I didn't care 100 USD either way - it is irrelevant now that they are worth 15 X what I paid for them.
If I see promise in a technology, I just buy it - I'll pay 20% over if it is convenient.  Who cares in 5 years?

It all depends on the world's Moms.  The quilt market is estimated to be worth 20% of that of gold.  If every Mom bought a quilt with Bitcoin, the bear market would be over and Dr Faketoshi has estimated BTC prices would rise by the equivalent of 6 trillion pillows.

Although I've held for a long time, I'm still very interested in the day to day prices.  I'm absolutely confident that people who bought at a relatively high price will get their returns - and that the major coin will be BTC.

A coin based upon lies, subversion, deception, centralisation and the needs of a mining cabal can never be trusted.
So Bcash can never prevail for those basic, fundamental reasons.
The cryptoworld may well be unregulated, but people are not stupid.  Whatever gains BCH may make will eventually fold back into trusted projects.
Let's put it another way: if a deceitful project like Bcash prevails - the cryptocurrency project is dead.
People like Ver don't care - they have made their millions, and are crypto-anarchists &amp; extreme libertarians (although their understanding of these complicated philosophies is rather weak.)
And I would add: there are faster and more effective cash coins - so Bcash falls between two stools, namely:
* It is not Bitcoin
* It is not that fast either

No probs:
At the moment, Bitcoin isn't widely used as a plural - most people write Bitcoins.  Also it is generally capitalised as a proper noun.
So that would become: Are your Bitcoins safe?
Then you could simply write:  Read before storing your..
You can also use 'must-read' as a noun.  e.g. This book is a must-read.  So you could have written: A must-read before storing your..

Sorry - nobody knows.  A lot of people pretend to.  Maybe some have a better insight.  But if it was truthfully known, we'd all be rich - and that isn't possible (yet!)
For example, I'm a hodler.  If I'd known 19k was the ATH in late December, I could have sold all my BTC, and re-bought at under 6k in Feb, and have 3x as many.
But I had no idea what was going to happen.  So I hodled.
I've actually lost nothing in BTC terms - except for the 'opportunity cost' of having more.
But it was zero risk.
I only paid 600 USD for my BTCs when I bought them a few years back - so who's complaining when they are at about 8k each now (and the probability of hitting that ATH easily again - but would I sell then..........)

My team and I visit r/btc to keep you informed.  It is hazardous to mental health.  We seek no recompense, but ask that you donate your shitcoins to any suitable charity that will save the babies.

Wow.  
Your guesstimate of a correction is severely overestimated.  Period.

I hope they don't all jump up and down simultaneously.

BTC spiked, the others followed.
If you want the reason, you need to talk to a female.

Ho ho.  So before you disappear up your own arse, what's your definition of definition?
-or arse for that matter.

I'd certainly like to see Ver and his Coinbase CEO mate in front of a congressional hearing trying to explain that Bcash pump.
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:50:53
Biggest volume in 1 hour **ever** - and you say the volume is poor.
What nonsense.  
@_date: 2018-04-19 19:13:17
Yep.  But that was when it was suddenly released on Conbase under circumstances that are still being investigated.

They're pretty cool with it.  Everyone has been caught out watching  porn as they go through a red signal.  This time I guess I was unlucky.

It's not hate, it is righteous indignation.
In academia you come across people like this, who can talk their arses off, but come a cropper on some very basic principles.
Years back, I was lecturing in **** and a new lecturer in **** arrived, and started to try to teach that subject.
He had smitten the non-technical interview panel with complete bullshit.  I was on the panel, and had tried to warn them, but I was junior and he was given the post.
Six months down the line his department had collapsed, because he simply didn't understand the subject he professed to be an expert in.
So this is not hate - it is logic.
And BTW, if you search Faketoshi on Wiki - where the information appears to be well referenced - he does not hold a clutch of doctorates.  He appears to hold one - in theology.
Bullshit baffles brains  :)
Edit: removed some hubris

Beijing waking up.
8k will be breached.
Then beyond 8.2 (8.5?)
Settling at 8.2.
Don't sell under 8.17
@_date: 2018-04-11 18:27:16
Well I was interested.
@_date: 2018-04-13 15:36:05
Shit.  I hadn't thought of that.  Or rather I have now, as I jumped back to 2011, thought of it, sold a pizza for 10,000 BTC and came back again.
@_date: 2018-04-01 13:19:18
Heh, not in even one of Everett's 'Many Worlds.'

Honestly, a few missiles fired at patches of desert by the orange baby have nothing to do with this.
@_date: 2018-04-20 18:30:55
It's a free market - if people want to take short positions, that's cool.
It is very risky though - but a risk they take.
As long as people are being honest, I have no problem.
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:54:05
No.  You also need to consider the pressure.  A human can only occupy around 1 sq meter.  The impact of jumping up and down in that area has bugger-all effect.  Multiply that non effect over a large area, and you have a non effect over a very large area :)
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:04:10
Once more unto the beach, dear pals, once more.
@_date: 2018-04-11 21:03:47
How much did you lose?
You bought near ATH, then sold, didn't you?
The only way you can make sense of it, is to see the market fail.
Unfortunately, you showed weak hands - and now you regret it.
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:48:28
You can't satire Ver and his stupid Bcash project either.
@_date: 2018-04-21 07:12:19
I think we'll easily reach 9k.
But there is silly money going into some really low quality alts. 
That can't sustain.
The question is - when that altcoin market corrects, where will the money go?  
Out - or into established coins.
@_date: 2018-04-16 07:20:46
20k by end of week?
@_date: 2018-04-09 08:57:28
Looking a bit bare on here, so it's got to be said:
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:33:21
Yes, that's a logical stance.  The technological inertia is huge.  I'm sure it will work out - at least for BTC.
I honestly wouldn't have much confidence in altcoins - although Monero has some special qualities, so I'm in there 10% to cover that privacy base.
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:49:41
Absolutely remarkable.
And they said it was dead.  
If someone poked BTC with a stick, it didn't just twitch that time.
Lying BCH didn't keep up either, down to 0.92.  What a great day for BTC.
@_date: 2018-04-30 18:14:45
Certainly indicates a positive trend.  Breakout?  Who knows.
@_date: 2018-04-27 20:41:50
I'm curious.  Could you clarify - who will be murdered?
Edit: Looking at your previous posts, you are a BCH supporter, and you are threatening me with murder?
Could you please clarify this?
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:11:23
Ho ho!
I'm not American.  You've just betrayed your own nonsense and prejudices.
@_date: 2018-04-08 16:38:36
I suggest you don't go to r/popcorn for popcorn recommendations, they only promote hotdogs.
@_date: 2018-04-09 11:41:13
Heh.  You have no idea do you?
@_date: 2018-04-08 13:44:03
Well that's set me off screaming and stomping again.
@_date: 2018-04-07 21:45:28
Well I've got four.  If you put them in big cracked frames, you might need a trolley.
There is no doubt the man is an arse.
But my hatred isn't ad hominem, it is Bcash.
Ver seems to steer clear of all this embarrassment somehow.
@_date: 2018-04-07 21:34:14
Be kind to him.  
Try it.
(oh, and don't forget to get a selfie of yourself being kind to share with your friends.)
@_date: 2018-04-01 12:55:36
Your target price is far too low.  That's not logical.
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:54:26
Within a 1 hour period, the BTC price went from below 7k to a peak of over 8k.  That is more than 1000 USD in one hour.
Why are you posting without bothering to check? - it took me 20 seconds.
@_date: 2018-04-08 08:14:24
This guy:
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:36:32
Look, we're pushing 8k now, wake up guys.

Finally some action - for better or worse.

UK gives foreign aid to India, and they build frickin' space rockets with it.
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:13:51
That pushed Bcash down to 0.092
(But they'll be shouting "we breached 700 USD" as if it was some sort of victory.)
Edit: added a bit.

Be good to have Vitalik in it somewhere.
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:20:24
Could be because of this anti-FUD regarding India?
I don't know.
@_date: 2018-04-19 16:35:03
Heh - like Bitcoin Gold, which is outperforming Bcash over 24 hours and neck and neck over 7 days.
Massive adoption for BTG too, eh?
It truly is the battle of the shitcoins.
..and everyone knows you're over here to shill Bcash.
edit: clarity.
