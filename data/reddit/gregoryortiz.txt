Thanks for that. I won't attempt mining, I'll leave that to the pros with their fancy computers and graphic cards :P. I just want to continue to sell my service but be able to offer it to even more people. Do you have any thoughts on Coinbase for accepting payments?

Thanks! I decided to go with coin base and set up everything there. My business now officially accepts bitcoin! :)

Let's hope only the bad ones that don't get actual results get killed! That way I can keep living.

Now it looks like Coinbase has it's own wallet? So if I go the coinbase route, I don't have to get a wallet on my mac then? Or is that incorrect?

Awesome will check them out. thanks.

There isn't a way to pay directly on the site since we do a consultation with everyone first since every client is different and we don't do "cookie cutter" SEO since we tailor it. However I totally should have added the bitcoin accepted button. Will do now. Thanks!
