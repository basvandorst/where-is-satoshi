Terrible example.
Phone A comes out today, costs 500 USD, costs or .84 BTC.
Phone B comes out 1 year from today, costs 525 USD or .084 BTC.
Person A who bought Phone A with BTC paid a .756 BTC premium to get his phone 1 year earlier, or 4500 in USD equivalent. 
Person B who bought Phone A with USD paid roughly the exact same in present value as he would a year later due to inflation.
I wonder which person regrets their decision and wishes they had waited more?
The made up price increase of Bitcoin doesn't matter, the situation is the same. There is already proof of this by the very low real transaction counts.

Uh no, unless you think I can go invest in pet rocks and allow them to exist in my basement is adding value to society.

You are very naive or borderline brain washed if you really believe anything you've said has gone over my head.

I am saying Bitcoin should be happy to call itself a zero sum game, the reality is much more likely it's a negative sum game. 
Unless me sending 20 cents to a friend creates more than $40 dollars of value somewhere along the lines. The cost is hidden because it's spread amoung hundreds/thousands of miners but overall everyone would be better off not getting involved.

That's pretty much it in a nut shell. You want to continue to invest 20 dollars a day to get 40 dollars a day two months from now. Your basically hoping to leech wealth from the system perpetually while adding 0 real value.

Maybe next time provide some legitimate proof before and it won't look like a pathetic scam.
For the record, "egocentric" is completely the wrong word to use to describe my postings. I assume you do not know what the word actually means.

So apparently if you have been a redditor for 13 days or less (4 of the 5 current "top" comments) you "support" this drive.
Doesn't seem like a scam at all.

I had the same problem and contacted the support, they seemed willing to work something out but it was taking forever (almost 2 weeks) and still nothing resolved so I looked for somewhere else to ship in Canada.
Found wtcr.ca, shipping is still a bit higher than you'd expect but nothing crazy. So if your looking for computer hardware in Canada I'd give them a look.

It decentralizes transaction costs and spreads it among all miners. $40 dollars total cost to the network to send a penny currently.

That's not what I said at all, I am saying your simpleton theory isn't going over anyone's head.

Except for the part where the bot assigns the numbers, pretty trivial to just assign the number to whoever you want to win..

Wow, you convinced me. A random blog post on the internet with absolutely 0 proof. 
Scum bag.

Wealth is created, sure. Bitcoin itself doesn't magically create wealth just by existing though. It needs to provide real value at some level.

Whether or not you "invest", it shouldn't preclude you from critical thought.

I think what a lot of people around these parts don't quiet understand is that for every dime (in whatever currency you'd like to use, BTC, USD or otherwise) is only possible when someone else injects equal value into the market. 
My point being, everyone can't simply buy X bitcoin and then retire in 20 years since that value still has to come from someone else. If everyone is hoping to simply extract value from the market, which seems to be the case, it's just a way to try and redistribute some wealth with everyone thinking they can come out ahead. The obsession with the price, or more importantly wanting it to continue rising at exponential rates, implies this is the case.
If you actually believe in Bitcoin you wouldn't care what the price is, you would actually use it. Since the # of transactions has basically stagnated for a year now, even with the increased purchasing power, it seems most users don't believe in it.

I know your post is 2 days old but just in case you haven't figure it out, if you select the advanced recovery check box you can enter your seed the same as your pin (based on the random location displayed on the trezor). This way even with your computer fully compromised your still not exposing anything. It's a bit of a pain in the ass because it takes a lot longer than just typing but nothing too difficult.

Seems like it's either a low end budget or bleeding edge top of the line. I'd consider just going top of the line but how reputable is the site?
