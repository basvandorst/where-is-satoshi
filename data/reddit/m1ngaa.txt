Oh man... Never ever get involved with something that promises you free money if you bring in a friend.

I hope that the banks will now mess with crypto a little less. We learned they can short it damn easily, but I'm sure that the banks are now learning someone bigger is watching it.

HODLing onto my BTC. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:28:33
BTC gonna moon right? I'm kinda confused. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:17:21
Get this piece of sh*t out of here. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:56:00
Why do you even mine on Antpool lol. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:36:04
So we BTC peepz mooning or what? ��
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:36:31
About to pump some sh*tcoin, or maybe bringing in Ripple. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:34:51
Will I be able to replicate it with my S9? 
It's my 2nd time seeing this happen within a week or so, and I just wondered if you can really pinpoint your machine to confirm a single tx :)
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:25:33
Yeah, but he's gotta watch his back too. If he pumps a real shitty coin, we'll come out of the woodlocks with hammers and shit.

Thank you guys. I've been against this China Bitcoin for like the longest time, but recently found myself tinkering about mining it. Now my mind is clear :)
**B**itcoin **CH**ina, should've made a new logo. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:31:12
Can't see the video. But yeah, d'uhh! Pretty sure he gets paid too :)

If you have 25, use one for each pool for like couple of days.
I'm on slush, it's been really good but last couple of days was kind of bad compared to previous days. After all, you'd be averaging the same from any pool and it's about .0025 BTC.

BCH stands for Bitcoin China, Jihan Wu created it and asked Roger to promote it because he owns Bitcoin.com
I'm Mongolian, I'm a next door neighbor of China and we hear shit. Roger will fuck up at some point, get dropped by Jihan and eat someone else's dick. It'll happen soon, Roger senses it that's why he's now promoting Naga coin.

I have, did so using couple of them :P nothing has worked tho. 
Should've known better :(
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:06:38
One more, what happened here :D
@_date: 2019-07-23 04:03:12
19 million in Bitcoin or 19 million bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:24:03
Explain this: 
This just happened 10 minutes ago, and there are 112.600 unconfirmed transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:06:36
Damn, he's soon gonna promote bcash shit too. Core team needs to accelerate! 
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:42:41
Thank you. 
You believe 1mb block cap is healthy right? Or 8mb or even bigger ones are better?
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:48:05
Thanks guys, still tryna find a block solo-ing so I have to learn so much!
Hahaha. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:53:02
I got half a BTC tryna get somewhere as well, and it's been like 48 hours. Can I add to or increase the fee I did?
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:58:19
$0. Because no one could buy as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:18:25
Is this really coming to the Bitcoin core? Holy smokes!!!
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:59:00
I'll pay for one!!! 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:14:01
The BTC Fam! Dang, hats down. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:24:47
Some millions would've been mined, for no reason... Just like how I mined millions of INF8 for no reason... 
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:52:35
Daaamn. Btrash peepz (Nicehash, Bitmain, Roger, Coinbase) really wanna kill Bitcoin! 
But didn't I hear 2 weeks is the maximum a transaction can be unconfirmed for?
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:47:49
She's a HODLer. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:47:32
Just checked. Love Piratebay! 
@_date: 2019-12-18 08:37:45
