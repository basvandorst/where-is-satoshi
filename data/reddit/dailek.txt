I think op is a liar.
@_date: 2014-01-29 17:38:27
God the sentiment here is so bad.
@_date: 2014-01-23 21:53:01
I did the wrong amount I mean 0.03 would you do it?
@_date: 2014-01-14 18:06:15
I guess.
@_date: 2014-01-15 05:08:16
@_date: 2014-01-14 03:38:03
Im 14 with 3 :P not too dificult.
@_date: 2013-05-10 23:10:41
@_date: 2013-05-11 03:21:16
Can confirm, owned many supercars.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:53:51
Because the bot made my account.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:33:13
That was the problem.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:56:15
Please don't invest when the market is this volatile.
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:37:56
Ur mean
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:56:55
That's pretty much prostitution...
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:59:48
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:14:00
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:03:21
Bitcoin is very volatile, and it is not a stock.
@_date: 2013-12-24 11:50:14
@_date: 2013-05-21 23:02:18
Why is this nonsense?
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:34:42
On blockinfo how do you do it?
@_date: 2013-04-20 23:12:32
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:20:09
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:00:10
Currency that is usefull.
@_date: 2013-06-10 19:06:42
I feel like this is a little bit of a scam, it doesn't take 70,000 to fund production of a documentary. And it shouldnt take more then $15,000 to live for 3 months, (Maybe even less).
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:18:47
I dont, i hope that mentality does though.
@_date: 2013-04-27 23:32:50
Except sealands not a nation, and if anybody really wanted to stop you they could. The only reason they haven't stopped them is because there is really no reason to.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:08:41
Lol, I'm sorry I guess I sounded like a bitch there, it was all luck, ESP BP I had like 800$ bough BP, good move I guess... Sorry.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:49:32
Oh that's cool! What are some other terms? I'm sorry, I'm new at this.
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:07:09
Lets hope.
@_date: 2013-05-22 02:35:41
Not really, if bitcoins were worth 100k each the whole bitcoin economy would crash.
@_date: 2013-04-27 23:33:27
That doesn't mean its a country.
@_date: 2013-04-16 00:32:02
No not at all.
@_date: 2013-11-26 04:23:05
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:53:27
Why, it's not a currency...
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:55:46
Good advice, my grandfathers best friend, took advice from his sister about various investments, they all did terrible, think for yourself and what's best for you.
@_date: 2013-05-22 01:44:06
I highly doubt that's possible.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:46:10
Mbc? Is that a normal bit coin?
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:31:16
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:53:56
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:57:23
The market is very volatile, too soon to tell.
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:29:33
Lol, any source other than the reddit circlejerk about Uruguay?
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:24:46
Holy shit, your amazing, why do you do that? Trying to support the currency, do you just have alot?
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:57:51
Too soon too tell, markets very volatile. 
@_date: 2013-07-01 11:33:49
In NYC no chance! Well I guess if you want to live like shit just to work for them.
@_date: 2013-12-15 22:49:18
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:51:15
Its cool.
@_date: 2013-05-08 14:39:15
So much faith...
@_date: 2013-10-03 21:27:12
Our dollar isn't just going to hyper-inflate.
@_date: 2013-06-11 04:59:13
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:52:27
Mt god is having a lot of problems.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:16:05
And the bitcoin circlejerk.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:37:07
The barrier that is keeping this from happening, is for one it's very volatile, I have some btc but the price is always changing. And for two accessibility its nearly impossibly for the average person to get and / or use right now. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:09:00
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:00:58
What are the altruistic ideals / ideas of reddit? HUGE this is where I think it all started. Many people think its a Ponzi scheme, but I have a lot of time and think, hey if I don't spend money, it's worth a try, so far, so good!
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:38:00
Can I have some? Ill do something.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:16:31
Don't invest anything you can't afford.
@_date: 2013-04-28 02:50:05
Even before then they probably would've attacked it, done something about it if there was any incentive.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:46:29
OMG, thanks so much! How do I tip you?
@_date: 2013-04-27 23:34:48
Why is this getting down-voted, they really don't, anything that happens is already in the planning.
@_date: 2013-06-01 04:43:18
Of course use a currency as a stock! Bound to succeed. /s
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:00:19
Wouldn't this be deleted then? 
@_date: 2013-11-26 07:19:26
A lot do.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:59:40
God such shitty stocks.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:24:54
@_date: 2013-06-18 19:29:21
Nice fucking parking!
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:47:28
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:05:58
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:27:52
Or, that bitcoin is a newer currency that will take many years of people accepting and devolping / getting used to. And needs to be way more stable.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:06:44
Then what?
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:06:51
Wow a whooe coin...
@_date: 2013-10-03 19:46:37
Its not going to be 1m dollars...
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:11:17
Isn't bitcoin too?
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:25:58
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:25:32
Did you buy your bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:04:52
I started at 8, now im 14, I started out with 200$ now I have about 6000$
@_date: 2013-11-25 23:03:38
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:00:59
@_date: 2013-05-11 03:19:07
Honestly how does this bring it even closer?
@_date: 2013-04-14 06:08:41
No he wouldn't.
@_date: 2013-05-14 18:55:14
Not really, stocks don't go up and down so drastically.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:24:07
Oh sorry
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:06:36
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:58:26
Okay?
