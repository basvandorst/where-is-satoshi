Couldnt you still be 100% bitcoin and convert to fiat as you go?

Meanwhile exchanges in other parts of the world are marching ahead and providing better and better security and trading options for consumers. He is just going to copy those and everythings thats been learned so far via the trial and error situation the bitcoin economy is pretty much in atm.

I wasnt talking about the welfare when i said great. Do you think the welfare is great?

My goodness, there have been more bank failures shady deals and lending practices in the very much regulated banking sector the last 10 years alone. Id like to see the evidence that supports the notion that government can step in and control people and buisneses to a degree that there is less fraud and bankruptcies. Because to me it seems everywhere its tried, things have not gotten better

Im not sure i understand what the problem is. Coinbase begins using fractional reserve. They can only do it, if buisness and individuals voluntarily agree to accept coinbase coins, meaning, accept coins out of the blockchain. This could cause problems, and if it does, who is affected? Only the people who voluntarily agreed to accept coinbase coins etc. 
You also have to keep in mind in the real world basically no one cares the extend to which their bank uses fractional reserves because the government guarantees their deposits. Its different in the bitcoin space because everyone is on their own. This helps prevent fractional reserve disasters because people are much more interested in the solvency of their bank/wallet/etc.

What i liked most about the page was this simple information at the top. However it is a myth that regulation does away with bankruptcies, fraud etc.




Exchanging or storing significant amounts of funds with third-parties is not recommended.

No, because like i said only the buisness and individuals who voluntarily agree to accept and use the coins get affected. A buisness who only accepts sound coins will not have increased demand. They may choose to accept fractional reserve coins, but they do it with a risk. If a company like coinbase starts approaching buisness with fractional reserve coins, meaning transactions done off chain, albeit at a cheaper rate than real coins.. They will come under severe scrutinty. There might be a market for it, there might not. Never the less people who choose to operate on the blockchain is sounder, and that is something most buisnesses and users prefer.
If fractional reserve or made up funny digital money should start to exist now, i dont understand. It would already exist if buisnesses and individuals would be willing to trust a 3rd party to mint for example coinbase coins or facebook coins and use them in everyday trade. But it does not exist, and that should be an indicator that it will never exist, not now, when we got bitcoin, which is much sounder

I think everyone is waiting for the american empire to act, then they will copy what they do:) It seems to be the way things have been going lately. What ever the americans do, the rest of the world copy:)
@_date: 2014-03-12 12:06:22
Sounds like you should start a competitor then
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:29:13
Ask them what they want
@_date: 2014-03-09 11:56:41
I think as long as you hold for more than 8 months you wil be ok. The currency might be volatile but you will be up regardles. People who bought at the high of the april rally, are still up alot today even tho bitcoin is down about 50% the last few months.
@_date: 2014-03-09 19:08:05
Monitoring is not the same as stopping. What good will all their survailence do, if they cant legitimately use it. I mean, if americans were prohibited from using bitcoin, yes they can make all sorts of things to try and enforce it, including massive internet survailance. But, the american government wont prohibit americans from using it
@_date: 2014-03-14 14:56:45
Im danish, and the danish government keeps postponing their decision for some reason. They promised an answer before end of 2013 regarding the taxation of bitcoin, but they postpone it month after month since then. What are they waiting for?
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:27:48
hehe thats life:) But in this case i believe they stand in the way just to stand in the way
@_date: 2014-03-14 14:49:59
Why do you think this?
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:11:37
I dont know what the purpose is of the bitcoin foundation
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:16:33
Until we know. Little to no bitcoin services will form in New York :) Dont expect to know any time soon...
@_date: 2014-03-09 11:55:29
You must have something you consider the most secure and willing to store your wealth in, if you had to choose betwen dollars or bitcoin which would it be and why?
@_date: 2014-03-10 21:58:16
I wonder how they do it
@_date: 2014-03-12 12:40:35
That was way too short :)
@_date: 2014-03-14 14:43:34
I like to think things arent that fragile. That it would take alot for the american government to ban bitcoin. First of all the rest of the world IS watching, and so is the american people:) If they want to do anything with bitcoin its going to be slowly regulated out of existance. Although i dont see how they can do that. In a way the current regulation that have been preventing an american exchange from forming has been good, because there have been no american exchange and thus bankrupticies fiascos etc. politicans can point to and say big bad bitcoin. Because thats the only thing i think can make the american people accept a down right ban, thats if bitcoin gets bad enough publicity so to speak. But i think there are  more enthustiaic people than bad, and more are comming every day i believe, so it will be harder and harder for authorities to paint bitcoin in a bad light and thus legislate against it

My investments or timings with bitcoin purchases have not been good. Im finally starting to be in the green, and feel more comfortable spending them.

The wealth came before the welfare, now all we got is finanical crisis. The bad times would have come alot sooner if the computer and the internet hadnt been invented and improved our productivity to such a degree. The productivity gains from computers and internet are about leveling out now, but the governments taking left and right has not stopped. The economy cant keep up, it cant produce the wealth the government takes, and the result is stagnation and recession.
@_date: 2014-03-13 19:15:08
How are GS doing financially? Werent they technically bankrupt in early 2008?

Well the bitcoin price would only have to reach $4721 for the total amount of bitcoin to be worth 100 billion. Then they will start to notice i think. Since there are only about 13 million bitcoin mined so far, the price would have to be a little higher before the market cap will reach it. But i dont think $5000 for a bitcoin is that unrealistic:) But thats besides your point. I was just wondering what it would take for them to notice, possibly a 100billion market cap, and thats about $5,000 for a btc

Why cant exchanges and individuals do naked short selling if they want?

What is the deal with austin?
@_date: 2014-03-09 04:11:32
The reason im asking is because im considering going 100% bitcoin. Convert everything to bitcoin, every months salary etc. Was wondering about the pros and cons.
@_date: 2014-03-12 10:15:17
I dont believe this. The system should be able to make good decisions by contacting the relevant people in the releveant industries without there being a foundation. For example they invited the ceo of Bitpay to one of the senate hearings which makes sense. The foundation have members with little or no experience with bitcoin companies, mark probably being the exception, but did we really want him talking bitcoin to government? 
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:45:37
Thats pretty awesome:)How did the school make money?
@_date: 2014-03-12 12:22:49
So what you are insinuating is if there was no salaries Gavin wouldnt be involved? And that there wouldnt be any development at all?
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:01:19
What im thinking is, you probably pay with bitcoin with your phone. There is going to be a few reputable wallets out there. If they see you do the transaction from a reputable wallet they dont need even 1 confirmation. Since its a small buisness as well they quickly get an idea what kind of person you are, they probably take your name and adress etc. as well? At least they got your licence plate. There is no reason for them to have you wait for 1 confirmation, because if things dont work out, they can proove the transaction didnt process and they contact you and a dispute mediator if they want to. But im sure the money will just be resent before it gets to any of that
@_date: 2014-03-09 23:54:37
So you would go 100% bitcoin but dont think there is a secure or convenient enough way to do it yet?
@_date: 2014-03-17 15:43:11
I think we have reached the climax of bitcoin with the dorian nakamoto story and the mtgox failure:) Its been a pretty cool ride but i will pass it on to the next generation. Im selling my btc today, barely making even. I wish the best for everyone else if they decide to stay in
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:50:29
The site looks nice. Although pretty slow atm. And their fees are a bit confusing.
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:42:58
Suddenly them keeping 10% in reserve makes sense. They make btc refunds much easier
@_date: 2014-03-14 13:28:59
Im beginning to think Xapo is a scam. They suppoedsly raise 20m dollars to develop a bitcoin wallet? Thats alot of money. Almost too good to be true. Then they mention insurance, which they suppsedly dont have.. Then there is this comment that is supposed to.. I dont know, get goodwill among bitcoiners. Im just waiting for them to go bankrupt or run with peoples money

Unfortunately this means the establishment will fight it tooth and nail:) He is affiliated some what with a party in Denmark which many people look down upon. What they believe in is freedom, lower tax etc. But danes dont understand these concept anymore, even tho that was how their great society was built. They all want the government to do everything, unfortunately it ends up taking rather than giving.... Anyway....
