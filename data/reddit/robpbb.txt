Be prepared to put on some weight, there is some damn good food here!

I've heard of colored coins before but don't know much about them. I'll have to give them a shot!
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:47:02
This is why I'm asking. No need to be so snide about it. 
@_date: 2014-08-26 21:30:30
I guess my timing was just right. I moved from New York to North Carolina :-)
Now if people would just take me up on my offer of being a free bitcoin consultant that would be great.

I don't see what the big deal is, if you don't like the fees they charge to secure your bitcoins hosted on their infrastructure, just move hold them yourselves or use another service. Free market at it's finest :-)

I never thought of it like that, very good point! I just wanted to do my part to help contribute to the community by making it easy for businesses that are interested in the currency.

Looking forward to spending my BTC at the TigerDirect here in Raleigh :-)

So if you cash out to other coins and never go back to USD, are you still responsible for claiming taxes? 
Also anyone actually claim a capital loss on BTC?

Thank you everyone who provided an answer instead of just mocking me. Some community we have here. 
@_date: 2014-08-04 13:36:14
Thank you!!
@_date: 2016-11-07 23:57:21
Fingers crossed

Upvote for keeping it real... just remember this is reddit so downvotes for talking smack about the faciest and chief.

Google CEO loves bitcoin :-)

You make a very valid point. As more people jump on the wagon and  avoid taxes, the more negative press cryptocurrency will get. This will cause government to intervene saying the funding supports terrorism or whatever fear tactics they use. I hate paying my taxes, I hate government force even more but I'm sure jail is way worse than both.

Forgive me if I'm wrong but I see an ROI from the genesis block at 110 days:
At 4BTC for 10GHZ
Can someone explain to me why this wouldn't be a good purchase?
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:02:48
I'm game!
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:14:06
I'm very sorry to hear of your troubles. I myself have a chase account that I will soon be closing after hearing this. On another note, I purchased a few of the pre-order red miners from your site. Will this news impact orders that have already been placed? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:46:33
Arise chicken!

Coin base ripped me off. They stated I would get the April 11th price, instead the charged me an older price. Sent them an email last night, have not received a response yet.

I was trading less than 1 BTC and didn't put a 0 in front of the decimal. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:36:26
Thanks you guys fixed the problem!
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:45:54
Any plans to add PPC/USD LTC/PPC etc? Also getting errors when trying to sell BTC for USD, any updates to this?
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:45:25
So I can have some hedge in USD for a buying opportunity :-p
