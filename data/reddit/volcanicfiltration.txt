Cheers I had a look, I'll stick to kraken for now though, they offer many more cryptos such as eth and ltc :)
Waiting for replies to my emails now, the plan so far: Fidor Deposit into Kraken -&gt; Kraken cash out into fire/revolut account -&gt; Transfer from fire/revolut into Fidor. I'm liking the look of fire the most right now.

Thank you, this is exactly the info I was after! Couple questions just to clear my conscience, would it be a good idea to use Fidor to purchase BTC/ETH/LTC on kraken.com, but use a different bank account to cash out? For example, link a Revolut Current Account to kraken.com and cash out in EUR and exchange it into £. Revolut is supposedly cheaper than transferwise and they have a current account.
Lastly, by saying that kraken.com don't require micro-deposits, does that mean I don't need an IBAN and BIC to link my account with them?

Fire looks really good, I enjoy seeing API as well:)
I will email Revolut, fire, N26 and bunq regarding their views on cryptocurrencies and will go with the one that is the most accepting! :) You've been a massive help, cheers!

Ah I see, TIL. :) I will ditch coinbase then and switch to kraken. Ideally, I would like to not include high street banks in my cryptocurrency life. Revolut has said they will possibly work on implementing bitcoin support in the future, as well as a unique IBAN in the next couple months. The question for me right now, is whether I should go with Revolut for my withdrawal method, once they have released an IBAN or go with N26 since they already have IBANs, however I don't know N26's views on cryptocurrencies. I would have to research more. :)

People recommend going on localbitcoins and selling directly to another UK resident, this is slightly more risky though. I was hoping for a direct transfer, I might be out of luck though.

Hey no problem, I thought the verification process was very simple. I decided to use IDNow on my Android phone instead of using a webcam on my Desktop. For the ID itself I used my passport, they asked a couple questions such as my passport number, date of issue etc which I had to read out and show on my phone's camera. After the verification was complete and everything was set up, my current account was ready to use.
I will write Fidor an email this evening about the IBAN BIC number, I'll update this post once they reply!

Thanks, looks like we won't have IBAN BICs until later on in the year.

I understand the privacy concern, good luck to you too!

Best of luck, hope you get the relief!

I intend to do everything legally, happy to pay the tax man. :) I'm anxious about my standard high street account getting frozen, hence why I set up a Fidor Account. What bank do you use to cash out?

If a coin split does happen and I have some BTC, what should I do to ensure that I receive the split coin?
