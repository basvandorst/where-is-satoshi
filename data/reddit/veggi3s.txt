bitpay's visa debit card ( bitpay.com/visa) card is better than the shift card because it isn't associated with fascism, (coinbase's business ideology)
you instantly turn bitcoin to fiat and then withdraw it from atm later or buy goods anywhere visa is accepted.
you can change bitcoin to fiat, but not fiat to bitcoin with the card.  
However, for your privacy concern. You can't get any financial accounts of any kind without giving your real name and info because of KYC - anti money laundering and anti terrorism laws. However, you would have better privacy with bitpay debit card than coinbase shiftcard because coinbase actively spies on its customers via its own private blockchain and they do family and relation checks on you or links them to you. So, if you send bitcoin to a gambling site, then you get banned and your whole family can never register and gets banned from the site.
However, bitpay debit card is really a prepaid card and is associated with a firm stable Metropolitan Commercial Bank. they serve a more traditional brick and motar role with your debit card banking. You pay small fees for atm and other services and thats it. They aren't so much concerned if you login to the bitpay.com site from a different ip because you are at your brothers house, and then ban you and your whole family.

Bitfinex was in violation of Cftcs over reaching jurisdiction that they asked the defendant for, because bitfinex kept the funds in its control "off exchange"

I have a bitpay bitcoin debit card and I can buy from any store visa is accepted.

At the beginning of the hearing document it says that each customer had a wallet which bitfinex controlled later it said something in a single wallet was all the funds. So it is unclear if it was in one wallet or many. In addition, is a single cold wallet more secure than many online wallets? Does cftc know more than bitcoin experts on this subject? 
Either way though. The cftc didn't have jurisdiction on this case. Florida ruled that bitcoin isn't money. And Dodds frank doesn't mention crypto coins. In the settlement agreement it says bitfinex has to admit that cftc has jurisdiction on this matter. Which is unobjective in itself and asking the defendant rather than Congress or judges to grant it power over bitcoin. It is bs.

Cite your source of 90%. You fucking dirt bag dirty bitcoin name for no reason. I use bitcoin instead of cash and have a bitpay debit card. Is 90% of fiat also used for illegal activities? You are full of shit.

They were in control of the wallet and could store it in cold wallets before the settlement, yes. After the settlement the wallets were forced to be hot ones where the customers owned the wallet. Customers couldn't have their wallets cold unless they took the coins off the exchange like bitfinex violation except the customers would be in control. 
It has everything to do with hot and cold wallets.

Please sue Cftc, not for money, but so that whoever didn't use discretion in this case to mindfully think about the situation, gets fired or resigns.  In Florida, bitcoin is ruled to not even be money. So cftc overstepped their power. And are incompetent.

Coinbase is the most fascist corporation that ever existed. You are lucky they haven't banned you, your ips, and your whole family for emailing them a complaint. 
If you want cash from bitcoin. I suggest the practically instant to fiat bitpay debit card. It is technically a prepaid card and you can exchange bitcoin to fiat near instantly, but not the other way around. And you can withdraw at atms or buy anything where visa is allowed.

Don't patronize me. It reflects how little you are. Maybe you have difficulty reading and understand? I didn't offer advice. And I have a good paying job. I guess satire flies past your density. 
Thanks for trolling and moving off topic. Be gone

I'm f'ing busy trying to work enough to eat and pay rent. Now, if I were a whale or if I actually had money in bitfinex then I would have more passionate and feel more offended by this hack. In addition, I don't know legal stuff and am not a lawyer. I, sir, am just a poor peon. If i tried to sue the big government organization cftc, then i might do more harm than good to myself because of time constraints trying to work to pay rent and buy food. However, I can surely motivate and social support you guys to all sue or complain to them. For instance, I complained to them on Twitter just now. I am pretty fumed on this issue. 65mil is a lot and I am sure many people are hurting because of this. I know that some people just make and barely make a living doing crypto trading. And I feel for them.

The bitgo keys, where were they stored? The impression here seems to be that they were stored at bitgo and therfore they were compromised too. How is that not possible?

Troll, do you have something that is on topic? You asked me a personal question. I gave you satire because your question was inane. Why don't you go kill any movement or mood with your disappassionate dismay rather than promote or progress. You are a Debbie downer,  sir. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:37:42
Nope. The hearing says specifically that the coins were being stored illegally because they were "off exchange."   they were trying to manage something they don't understand without evaluating the technology. If you intend to be a doctor and help people, you should study medicine. They lacked expertise, and therefore their "jurisdiction"  is suspect. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:13:10
Yes, but bitcoin hasn't been declared a commodity by Congress nor judiciary. Only the Crypto coin experts at cftc. In addition, their reasoning that it is a commodity isn't even mentioned in detail in their hearing papers. 
The Florida court has said that bitcoin isn't money. 
If I buy computer parts on credit from Newegg, is cftc going to regulate visa or Newegg for that? 
@_date: 2015-12-14 10:11:46
yeah, tell us some more bs that he claims he did.
@_date: 2015-12-11 20:34:27
I bet it is totally awesome. Too bad COINBASE sucks. I wish shiftcard were partnered with other exchanges as well.
@_date: 2015-12-12 07:41:48
please tell us how someone could do this kind of (illeagl) hack?
@_date: 2016-01-02 15:10:25
That's probably exactly what did it. They have an over zealous security system that flags any ip changes. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 14:59:48
Coinbase is run by fascist dictators who give you tickets for j walking. They treat many people poorly and should be ashamed of themselves. It is true they used to be a well company back when they didn't have so much power, back in 2013 and 2014.
