It's not a proper noun because it refers to a class of nouns (a bitcoin, the bitcoin, my bitcoin, that bitcoin over there) like any other normal noun (a table, the table etc) whereas a proper noun refers not to a class but to one specific individual (e.g. London town - you can't say a London or my London etc) which matches with the Bitcoin Network. (It's sometimes allowed to use "the" with a proper noun)

Jokes on you, the total cost of our healthcare system in the UK is actually cheaper overall, and this is typical of many european countries. So people in the US use more of the budget on it *and* get financially ruined when something bad happens to your health. At least you have the freedom to shoot up children in school!

And when it has a properly decentralised DNS system. But there is still the problem that we have no good solution if we want to use cables, like optical fibre.

Are you seriously saying that only young people use the term faggot, or that only young people are rude?

Um, no... Everyone agrees bitcoin needs to be used to purchase goods and services more for it to develop into a proper currency and start acting like one rather than an investment or stock.

Look, I'm just as much of a bitcoin fan as the next guy, but let's be realistic. Bitcoin does not **act** like a proper currency **yet**. People don't earn in bitcoin, it's very volatile compared to USD, and people who are considering bitcoin investment tend to want to be able to convert back to USD at some point. It's natural to perceive value in USD, not btc.

The are among the most socialist countries in the world, socialism is only considered a bad thing in america
@_date: 2019-03-12 11:04:20
The USA spends more public money on healthcare and does a worse job than most of Europe. Socialism has resulted in the best countries to live in, e.g. Scandinavian countries. You're indoctrinated

Really? They haven't stopped me... Credit card or bank transfer? Any other info you can share? When was this?

I tried to buy some bitcoins but it says I have to upload a picture of my passport or something. I find that prospect a bit scary, is that really what it takes to buy bitcoins without leaving my house?
Why can't I buy bitcoins easily with PayPal or visa? If the answer is because it's reversible, how come amazon doesn't get scared sending me physical stuff, but exchanges are scared sending bitcoin?

This is super silly, you really think it's as easy to pressure someone into doing a legal trade of a house which the authorities care about vs sending a digital asset that the authorities still think is fake monopoly money? One is a huge process and one takes ten seconds

If you were selling something for BTC, would you hand over the item after that or wait until it confirms?  
Visa/Mastercard confirm instantly, and therefore we can use contactless cards to tap into the subway, for example. That's an application where the feasible wait time is literally &lt;1 second as people are queuing behind you.

Actually, if you dig a little deeper, it's not. They don't necessarily lend money other people deposit, as in, they don't have to wait for people to deposit cash before they can make loans.
When people deposit cash, that becomes an asset for the bank, obviously. When the bank wishes to make a loan, they simply have to increase the customer's bank balance and record a loan asset. Because the customer doesn't usually want his loan (for a house or car or whatever) in cash, the bank doesn't have to wait for deposits before it can lend. However, the loan is also a liability for the bank, because once the customer spends the money, the bank is going to have to settle with other banks in some form or another.
So it's not as simple as "banks lend money other people deposit". They just lend money.

Hmm... I don't disagree with you, and I am a Bitcoin supporter, but you don't actually know what Bitcoin was created for. We don't even know for sure who created it, let alone what they were planning.

Are you serious?? I'm actually inclined to believe that you didn't read it properly, as the guy you're replying to has asked a good question. How can you act like some minutia about how the lightning network handles tiny transactions is beginner level knowledge?

Haha. But what about the PIN?
