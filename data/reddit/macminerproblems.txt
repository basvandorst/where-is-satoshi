Can't wait! Where can i view it live online?
@_date: 2017-02-27 22:08:45
Bit Quen is my favorite crypto.
@_date: 2017-02-27 03:11:42
Get off of Reddit, Smith.
@_date: 2017-02-27 03:47:48
Why's that? In the future, we may have 50 Terabyte hard drives.
@_date: 2017-02-27 21:25:58
Was about to post this! Whatever it is, it's good as a temporary band-aid, but we still need scaling, quicker transactions, and lower fees.
@_date: 2017-02-27 23:03:44
Where can I view a recording?
@_date: 2017-02-28 01:43:54
Interesting theory.
@_date: 2017-03-02 22:20:26
And no photography/phone use anywhere within the building.
@_date: 2017-03-03 19:04:16
Try double spending with a higher fee. Not an expert tho and this could be horrible advice
@_date: 2017-03-02 22:02:03
She still mentioned Bitcoin as a payment method. Acceptance and adoption of the Blockchain will eventually translate into acceptance of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-03 00:11:53


I included the word bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-03 02:57:37
By 2140, 1 BTC=1 Ton of gold
@_date: 2017-03-03 03:35:34
What proof would satisfy you?
@_date: 2017-03-03 01:09:08
With 1.5 mil? Definitely a small increase in the price (maybe 0.5%) but he's not manipulating the market. Bitcoin has gone up 7% in the last week, it would take a lot more than 1.5 mil to do that.

That is all that I claim is a fact. All I claim is that something was said. I take it at face value because I'm pretty sure the Federal Reserve wouldn't want their non-chairman employees lying to the public. I'm not going to find the tour guide and ask her to respond to questions from a bunch of anonymous bitcoin enthusiasts because I respect her privacy. I don't claim to have access to any emails, docs, or public statements. All that I did in my post was relay information that my tour guide said.
@_date: 2017-03-03 01:30:33
I don't care if you don't believe me; I was there myself and that's all the proof I need. Also, I wasn't allowed to record anything inside the building.
@_date: 2017-03-03 23:55:31
Without people such as OP spending bitcoin, bitcoin will never be adopted as a currency. I'm planning on spending BTC a week from now.
@_date: 2017-03-03 02:03:17
There is no official website, and no official registration. Bitcoin is decentralized. Instead, there are many exchanges.    (thanks, are some good examples. After buying that bitcoin, it is advised that you move it to an offline wallet. Many people use hardware wallets, other paper wallets, others downloadable wallets. However, if it's a one time $30.89 purchase, just move the bitcoins directly from your exchange to the address of the person you're buying the product from.
@_date: 2017-03-04 01:02:53
I didn't have to. It was voluntary.
@_date: 2017-03-03 02:31:55
I have yet to find any free ones; exchanges have to make some money after all.
@_date: 2017-03-04 00:53:50
That's just because I put my btc in cold storage when I first purchased them. Under normal circumstances, I could. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 14:45:35
But it's a true anecdote.
@_date: 2017-03-03 00:04:18
It was absolutely amazing. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 00:42:50
I'm only planning to do it a week from now because I don't have access to any at the moment :)
@_date: 2017-03-03 01:43:45
Long term holding: No time's a bad time
Short term investment/using it as currency: Wait a month or so and see if the price drops.
@_date: 2017-03-02 22:14:12
No, the one in NYC.
@_date: 2017-03-02 22:19:13
Nah, they don't print in NYC. They told us they do that in DC. No shotguns, but security was really tight. Cameras and policemen everywhere, rotating doors (the kind that only let 1 person in at a time), needed government-issued ID, used X-ray and metal detector. They even have their own police force just for the building.

Bitcoin doesn't fluctuate that extremely. Prices would adjust over time, just like fiat currency.
@_date: 2017-03-02 23:54:25
Not Wall Street, but New York City. And it didn't cost money.
@_date: 2017-03-02 22:25:52


When purchasing, don't think "Damn, I can only buy 0.5 BTC? That's expensive!" Instead, think "Wow, the market cap right now is only $20 billion dollars! What a great time to invest in this innovative currency!"
