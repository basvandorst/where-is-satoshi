We don't know what is happening behind the curtain.
It will be foolish for Bitfinex to hack them self. The imago is more valuable than the gain from a theft with the risk to be caught. Moreover the stolen Bitcoins are stuck in their wallets for a long long time.
But it is possible that "they" are in contact with the hacker or they know who he/she is. Then they are convinced that they will have part of the coins back.
If this is true, then they are buying BFX token for a bargain and make a lose situation into a win.
That is just big speculation on what is going on there

@_date: 2016-06-10 10:45:31
That's usually the fee for such kind of services. You can check all around the world and you will see that the fees are even lower than other operators
@_date: 2016-06-14 10:56:21
Is it really the answer from the girl ?
@_date: 2016-06-10 17:49:32

My first try was with 0.8.2 and it worked fine ! Then the 0.8.3 comes up and I decided to switch to it. I don't have memory issues in running the bitcoind or bitcoin-qt on the Raspberry PI. I increased the swap file for the compiling.

The security is done with Iptables. Only port 8333 should be open to the internet side. RPC and telnet (SSH) ports should be opened only by the inside of the lan. But I'm not an expert of Iptables. So I would prefer someone else give me hints to make it safe.
bitcoin.conf has some parameters that can be used to restrict access, especially for the RPC calls. RPC calls can be done with SSL, but not implemented in this release yet.
