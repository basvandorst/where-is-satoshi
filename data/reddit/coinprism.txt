Coinprism is based on Open Assets. The other ones (Colu, Coinspark, Chromawallet) use other non-compatible protocols.
There will be more wallets appearing with support for Open Assets.  is one of those.

It's mostly to play with :) More like a collectable if you will.

It has proper support for reissuing an asset (secured by a private key), and it's designed so that clients can discover the colors without user interaction.
With chromawallet you need to manually import into the wallet every color you want to use.
@_date: 2014-05-11 18:19:12
Correct, and without the need to buy a "middleman coin" like MSC to use it.
Also it's more scalable than Mastercoin as you don't need to scan the Blockchain.
@_date: 2014-10-21 21:59:55
Sure, but what I'm talking about here is (absence of) transaction 1 invalidating transaction 2.
@_date: 2014-11-27 22:07:11
There is a misconception that limiting the supply of a token via the protocol provides any guarantee to the user. The issuer can always create a second asset, and associate it with the same terms and conditions as the first one, which is equivalent to reissuing.
If anything, limiting reissuance gives a false sense of security.
@_date: 2014-05-11 22:36:21
Open Assets IS colored coins. The consensual definition of colored coins is that:
1. Assets are associated with outputs, not addresses.
2. It works without a metacoins like MSC or XCP
2 is self explanatory. Regarding the first point, in Mastercoin and Counterparty, balances are linked to an address. That means you need to scan all the transactions in the blockchain in order of appearance in order to know the balance of an address. This is also why those two protocols can't work with unconfirmed transactions.
With colored coins, because of 1, you only need to know about the transactions between the output you own, and the transaction that issued the colored coins. That's more scalable (even if not quite SPV) than scanning the whole blockchain.
The idea of taking a satoshi and coloring it was the original idea behind colored coins, but the colored coin community moved away from this, first padding coloring schemes (which was only partially solving the problem), then Open Assets. The original idea was clearly not practical. If you want to issue 10 million shares for your company, you'd need 0.1 BTC just to get started. That cost is entirely unnecessary.
@_date: 2014-05-29 14:43:56
Colors can be distinguished by looking at the issuing address, the same way users have to check the transaction hash in the color definition they downloaded for Chromawallet.
Also, we plan to use the SSL infrastructure to let issuers bind their color definition with a certificate they own. Amazon would be able to prove that "Amazon coins" have been issued by the same company to which the " certificate belongs to ("Amazon.com Inc.").
@_date: 2014-05-14 15:06:24
This is on our todo list. We will make a command line wallet that can run independently of any third party service.
@_date: 2014-09-03 15:48:57
One reason why people have been going mainly towards counterparty so far is that they had a fully working product first (though now colored coins is almost at feature parity), and also that counterparty got endorsed by adam levine from "let's talk bitcoin", who is very influential. Before adam levine started "pumping" counterparty, mastercoin had still more users than counterparty.
But approaches like counterparty and mastercoin, relying on a meta-coin, cannot survive long term. As Adam Back (one of the fathers of Bitcoin) [commented]( recently:


@_date: 2014-08-03 21:43:29
You can have gold, dollars or ham on the blockchain, thanks to colored coins. This block explorer lets you see all that.
@_date: 2014-08-27 20:11:53
That's wrong, the colored coins are of course stored on the blockchain.
Metadata is stored by the issuer, so it is not more centralized than XCP.
@_date: 2014-08-27 18:21:15
For now Coinprism, and more are coming.
@_date: 2014-11-27 17:57:04
The problem is not the blockchain size, it's the bandwidth requirements.
@_date: 2014-12-11 01:05:43
There are two ways to link a "contract" to an asset. The first one is to embed the URL in the OP_RETURN, but in that case, there is not enough space in 40 bytes to include the hash. The second one is to use OP_DROP (the actual format in the specification is  PUSHDATA(&lt;asset definition pointer&gt;) OP_DROP [remainder of the script]
where &lt;asset definition pointer&gt; is u=&lt;asset definition URL&gt;&amp;sha256=&lt;sha256 hash&gt;, URL encoded).
With that second method, you can easily embed the hash since you're only limited to 520 bytes.
So embedding the hash is possible, but not required because "providing a framework for legally enforceable contracts is out of scope of this specification".
I am not sure what you mean with the self enforcing contract, but when you own an asset, you can always spend it to any address you want. Usually redeeming the asset entails sending the asset back to the issuer.
Nicolas Dorier himself can answer regarding NBitcoin contributions.
@_date: 2014-05-11 19:52:34
We're back to the net neutrality debate. Miners shouldn't be looking at transactions and arbitrarily prioritize one over the other using any other criteria than the fees-per-byte ratio.
Colored coins transactions pay fees like "black and white" Bitcoin transactions, so they should be treated the same.

You should create two "Wedding rings" as assets as colored coins on  and distribute one to each of you.
Then you can frictionlessly divorce by sending the colored coin to the new husband, anywhere in the world and with minimal transaction fees.
How does that sound?

Awesome work guys!
@_date: 2014-03-16 10:52:22
Usually, the user will have on their wallet both colored and uncolored coins. If you want to send an amount of those colored coins, you will also have to include a small amount of uncolored coins for fees. The wallet will do that automatically for you (you just have to specify how much fees you want to pay).
@_date: 2014-03-29 23:52:39
If everything goes down, you can always do ad hoc trading (P2P, without using any third party service - like you can do with normal uncolored BTC). The blockchain and the information on it is there forever and will always exist.
The shares are not tied to a specific provider, the same way your BTC in blockchain.info are not tied to blockchain.info. You can re-import the keys in a different wallet any time you want.

The problem of debt accounting has been solved for the first time millennia ago. Now which solution is inferior to which is up for debate.

By more maintenance, I mean that if you run a counterpartyd for your server, you need to update it every time the protocol changes and a new version comes out. With colored coin, there is no new version, the protocol specification is completed.
@_date: 2014-05-27 20:25:48
Coinprism here.
There some misunderstanding about colored coins / coinprism:


Coinprism doesn't offer HD wallets, but everything is client side as well. The server is also only used for broadcasting transactions. The "traditional account system" is just so we can offer proper customer service.


Any BTC address is also a valid colored coins address


You can pay dividends to shareholders with colored coins, this is absolutely supported implicitly by the protocol out of the box. 
Another point worth mentionning is that the open assets protocol (colored coins) is much simpler to implement for a company who wants to integrate colored coins.


Several companies are working on decentralized exchanges for colored coins, and it will work much better than XCP and MSC's decentralized exchanges
@_date: 2014-05-12 10:57:54
See my response above:


@_date: 2014-05-12 11:10:33
Every single transaction in the blockchain is potentially affecting a MSC or XCP balance somewhere else.
Imagine Alice and Bob create a contract for difference together on counterparty. Then feed provider Charlie updates the price feed with a "broadcast" transaction. That broadcast transaction modified Alice's and Bob's balance even though it doesn't touch Alice's or Bob's address at all. So if you want to know the balance of Alice, there is no efficient way to do it other than examining every single Bitcoin transaction in the Blockchain, looking for a potential update of the price.
This is one of the reasons why Mastercoin struggles so much to have all the different wallets agree with each other on the balance of some addresses.

Until today you could only use the Bitcoin network to send cash (Bitcoins).
Colored coins allow anyone to create their own coin. Those can then be sent across the Bitcoin network to anyone with a Bitcoin address, the same way you send Bitcoins.
For example, Bitstamp could allow you to withdraw your USD into your Bitcoin wallet as "USD-Bitstamp coins". You can use each of those coins as a coin redeemable at Bitstamp for exactly $1 credit.
@_date: 2014-05-13 12:46:11


You can use colored coins to issue a coin without the need for a metacoin, which isn't the case with counterparty. You need XCP, which is very illiquid.


That's not true, colored coins can absolutely realize a decentralized exchange, a more efficient one as a matter of fact. Atomic swaps are supported out of the box.
@_date: 2014-11-10 12:22:30

@_date: 2014-03-16 00:20:06


No but you are required to type your password when signing a transaction.


At the moment, we don't have BIP32, but you can still create multiple addresses if you wish.




Yes we store encrypted keys like blockchain. If the site is hacked, we have an additional layer of encryption (with our own key) that the hacker needs to get passed before they even get the chance to start brute-forcing the keys. Also we use key stretching (much more iterations than blockchain.info) which makes brute forcing extremely expensive.


Users will have to be careful about this. But in most cases, you would only send colored coins to someone expecting them, which means they are using a color-aware wallet.


Yes this is something we may do in the future (but the short term is to improve the web wallet).

@_date: 2014-05-11 21:04:46
It's a different project from Chromawallet, Coinprism uses a new protocol called Open Assets (
Which plugs nicely into you first question: Open Assets is not using satoshis to encode the asset quantity. You can make 100 million token out of 600 satoshis if you want. This is one of the improvements of Open Assets over the "old" colored coin paradigm.

@_date: 2014-05-13 12:55:35
If you need to do this on such large scale, then of course you would ask the investor to pay for the 600 satoshis. This can even be done in a single transaction.

You don't need to buy any intermediary coin to use it (like XCP).
Also, it's more scalable as the clients don't have to scan all the transactions in the Blockchain before they can tell you your balance.
Finally it uses OP_RETURN so it doesn't pollute the UTXO.

You have two options, by default, an asset ID (which looks like a bitcoin address) is automatically assigned to the asset, and is cryptographically secure (i.e. it's impossible for two people to get the same asset ID by coincidence).
The second option is setting a name and ticker in the metadata.

An unconfirmed transaction on Counterparty has a risk of being cancelled even if there is no double spend. This is not the case with colored coins.
In a face-to-face transaction, with open assets, it is enough for the merchant to trust that the customer will not double-spend. It is not enough with counterparty. Sure, you can accept it, but you are taking a gamble.
@_date: 2014-11-10 14:05:01
This is an advantage of colored coins, not bitcoin.


If you send Bitcoins, the recipient is exposed to the volatility of Bitcoin unless they sell them. Here, I am saying you can send directly dollars, the same way you send Bitcoins.
You can also send stocks, or precious metals. Again, they don't need to be exchanged like Bitcoin does.

No, it's complementary. It actually gives more intrinsic value to BTC, because you need to pay fees in BTC when sending or issuing assets.
@_date: 2014-09-03 00:34:01


And if they do, they create an entirely new currency - an XCP clone, not compatible with the existing XCP, fragmenting the liquidity. This is not the case with colored coins, since it's only based on Bitcoin.


No, coinprism only stores the username. Passwords and private keys are **not** stored by Coinprism. This is the same model as blockchain.info.
@_date: 2014-10-14 11:05:37
Yes there is still a 1 to 1 mapping with regular bitcoin addresses.
As an example, you could take a regular bitcoin addres (1abcd...yz) and reverse it (zy...dcba1). It is still the same address, but represented differently.
Color-aware wallets would give you the reversed address to receive colored coins, and they would only accept to send colored coins to reversed addresses. Because color-blind wallets don't give you a reversed address, you can't accept colored coin payments into a color-blind wallet.
You could still receive Bitcoins on the regular, non-reversed address.
That's just an example, in practice it wouldn't be reversed, but probably use a different version byte (which would make the address **look** completely different to a human).

Colored coins can do voting and dividends just fine. Check Coinprism.
@_date: 2014-03-30 12:00:44
1) Correct, it's better to use as little as you can. The only reason why you wouldn't want to use the smallest possible amount is that there is an anti-spam rule currently saying you can't send less than 5400 satoshis at a time. So if you want to be able to trade small quantities of shares, you may want to select 1 share = 5400 satoshis.
2) It all depends on the legal structure chosen by the company issuing the shares. But typically yes, additional rounds dilute equity.
3) There would needs to be a legal contract, the same way there is a legal contract when you issue paper stock certificates. Colored coins removes the need for a bank for accounting, since the accounting is done though the blockchain. The rest (i.e. legal structure) still need to exist to protect shareholders.
@_date: 2014-10-28 00:13:58
Any reason not to re-use what already exists (like open assets)?

You don't need to add it to Coinprism. You just send the colored coins to Coinprism, and Coinprism will automatically detect the asset.


That is not possible as long as the color has been issued correctly with regard to Open Assets.

You can find it here: 
This is done so that wallets can verify they are sending colored coins to a wallet that understands them. It's optional but recommended. We will soon start validating the address type on Coinprism.

In the case of shares of a company, re-issuing shares is something very common to do when the company needs to raise additional funding. That typically results in dilution of the equity and decrease in the stock price.
In the case of something scarce (like gold), see the response above.

The downside of Counterparty is that the development is centralized. There is one client (counterpartyd), and there will always only be one. That means one or two persons get to decide what to implement, what changes to make.
I challenge anyone of making a second alternative client, fully compatible with the first. You will find it's impossible, because all you will do all day is try to catch up with the protocol changes implemented in the "official" client, and fix compatibility issues because the intricacies of the Counterparty protocol are so complex.
On the other hand the Open Assets protocol for colored coins that OP is using is extremely simple, and more importantly, it's final. It will no longer change. Those two things allow anyone to reimplement it however they want. As a matter of fact there are already 3 different compatible open source implementations: Colorcore (Python), Assembly.com (the OP), and NBitcoin (.NET).
People haven't realized it yet, but Counterparty has centralized control and decision making.
@_date: 2014-08-02 23:48:21
You have coinprism for colored coins, it's at least as good as counterwallet.
@_date: 2014-08-04 09:52:20
Except the only thing it takes to kill or fragment this liquidity is a fork of Counterparty. It will creates a new XCP coin, incompatible with the old one, and therefore fragment the liquidity. This is exactly what is happening with Ripple and Stellar.
If XCP becomes (really) successful, this is bound to happen.
One of the many possible scenarios: BitPay wants to get in the game. They fork the Counterparty codebase, improve it in some areas, remove things in others, essentially creating a new incompatible clone (with a "real" funded team behind it). They get a few big names onboard (they have a lot of contacts). Now you have half people on Bitpay's XCP, and the other half on the old XCP.
It's foolish to think this can't happen. Hell, it already happened, Counterparty is already a "clone" of Mastercoin, splitting the liquidity in two.
This is why colored coin is more sustainable in the long run. The liquidity is only sitting on Bitcoin. Unless you fork Bitcoin (and lose 95% of the target market), you can't fork colored coins.

It's not, after a reorg, transactions can reappear out of order in the new chain (as far as the Counterparty protocol is concerned), making some transactions that used to be valid invalid.


Storing is only one part of the story, you need to be able to spend them as well. As far as I know you can only spend them using Armory offline transactions.


You don't have to store the whole data on the blockchain for it to be secure. A hash of it is enough. Check out [our blog]( for more details on all those topics.

Well if you accept payment in "GoldCoins", you'll have to trust the issuer that those GoldCoins are backed by sufficient reserves. The improvement compared to current system is that everybody can check how many of those GoldCoins have been issued, because that's recorded on the blockchain.
The trustworthiness of the issuer will be a factor in the price of the gold coin. If people think there is a significant risk that the issuer has insufficient reserves, the market price of that coin will be maybe only 50% of an actual oz of gold.
@_date: 2014-05-11 22:50:07
Yes but that's only a very small percentage of all the transactions on the blockchain. With MSC and XCP, you need to scan 100% of the transactions.
@_date: 2014-12-09 00:49:34
This is a misunderstood limitation of Counterparty.
No, blockchain reorgs can cause Counterparty transactions that were previous confirmed to be rolled-back.
Simple example:
- Transaction 1: Alice receives dividends for an asset she owns.
- Transaction 2: She sends these dividends to Bob.
After the reorg, transaction 2 can appear before transaction 1 (even in a different block), causing transaction 2 to be dismissed, even though it had been confirmed before the reorg occurred.

The blockchain contains only a URL pointing to the metadata file. 40 bytes is too small to store pictures and a decent description.
The metadata file is stored on our server by default, but this can be customized when you are issuing a coin: you can specify a URL on your own server.

The protocol is open and entirely specified here: 
In theory that's all you need to implement a library.
We will also implement an open source library later on, but if this is something someone urgently needs, they can absolutely do it on their own by following that specification.
Chromawallet devs have said they will implement the open asset protocol as well, this is why I am pointing to Chromawallet for an open source implementation.

The security critical code (encryption, decryption, transaction signing) is all done in the client side, so if you want to audit it, you can very easily fire up the developer tools of you favorite browser and audit this code.
Publishing the source code doesn't mean that it matches what the server is running. The best is to look at the JavaScript being served, which you can easily do with Coinprism.

[This page]( seems to indicate the fee is 5 XCP, not 0.5 XCP. Not sure what the current fee is, but just the fact that the fees are controlled by the developers of XCP in itself is a problem, and is a form of centralization.


We didn't claim otherwise.


Coinprism is not more centralized than counterwallet.


This is the main misconception around those kind of technologies. The problem is not where the data is stored, it's where the value of the token comes from. The value comes from the issuer, and that's the case with any kind of technology (both colored coins and counterparty).

The asset quantity is not encoded using satoshis. So if you have 100 million tokens on 600 satoshis, you can send 50 millions to Alice encoded on 600 satoshis, and 50 millions to Bob encoded on 600 other satoshis. You'll need to put in an additional 600 satoshis of course.

This is not true. Many cryptographic systems rely on destroying a key. Credit cards and tamper-proof HSMs are examples of that.


If you can ensure the private key hasn't been leaked, you can certainly delete it effectively. If the private key exists only for the duration of one signature, it is easy to make sure it hasn't been leaked, and therefore effectively delete it.


You can **never** enforce scarcity of a user-issued asset. The locking feature in Counterparty does not enforce scarcity of an asset. It enforces scarcity of tokens with a particular name. There can easily be multiple names referring to the same real asset.
If an issuer is dishonest, locking his asset does **not** prevent him from creating a second asset, backed by the same thing as the first.

This is the same situation as Bitcoin exchanges, yet millions of people use them.

That is not really an issue, if the server goes down, you can always re-import the key onto a different wallet that supports BIP32. Remember the key is on the phone, not on the server, and the asset data is on the Blockchain.
The Blockchain.info wallet does the same, it connects to their central server. Coinbase also connects to their server, and the key is even stored on the server. Coinbase plus Blockchain.info represent millions of wallets.

All your code has to do is parse the OP_RETURN marker output, and you are able to interpret open assets transactions. The whole specification (including examples) is 6 pages ( With XPC and MSC, you essentially have to read the code to understand how their protocol is supposed to work.


The solution is to use a separate decentralized system for the exchange, not based on a blockchain. Blockchains are slow and don't scale well with high frequency operations. It's not the right tool at all for an exchange. The final settlement can then be made on the blockchain, but at a lower frequency.

The system only tells you who is behind the coin, not whether you should trust them or not. The user still has to do his due diligence.
SSL certificates with organization validation or extended validation have an organization name attached to them, which has been verified by a certificate authority.
You can't have a certificate issued to you with the name "Amazon.com Inc." unless you actually have a company of that name. Coinprism will leverage that, and display the name of the company prominently, much like your browser shows you the company name in the address bar when you visit

First, thanks for the good words.
But reading your explanation, I don't really see why you couldn't use open assets here. And in fact, what you are doing seems very similar to what Coinprism already does through PoA (Proof of Authenticity), where the issuer links the asset to a contract bidirectionally, and can change it over time, while still guaranteeing a cryptographic link between the contract and the asset.

You need XCP to issue asset. That's a serious enough limitation that doesn't exist with colored coins.
If you want to dynamically issue tokens hundreds of times per day, Counterparty is just not a viable option.
@_date: 2014-08-03 16:30:39
Counterparty forces everyone through their currency XCP, which is very illiquid. Colored coins don't have this problem because it's based directly on bitcoin.
Also, the counterparty protocol changes very often, and forces clients to upgrade, or you might go out of consensus, and your XCP become worthless. This is not the case with colored coins since the protocol is final and the protocol doesn't control a meta-currency.
The main benefit of counterparty over colored coins is that you can do P2P betting, but the philosophy behind colored coins is that less is more.
@_date: 2014-07-12 23:09:09
Yes they are both open source.
First off, Coinprism (colored coins) doesn't use a meta-coin (like XCP for counterparty). You don't have to burn bitcoin to receive XCP, to issue coins on colored coin, as it's all based directly on Bitcoin. All you do with colored coins are standard bitcoin transactions. It's a more pure approach.
Also the philosophy behind colored coins is that less is more. It's only about the ability to issue and manage assets on the blockchain. On the other hand, counterparty also lets you do peer to peer betting and CFDs. However the protocol for counterparty is much more complicated, and changes often, requiring services that use it constant maintenance.

Feel free to point out anything that is not accurate.
Don't get us wrong, Counterparty is a great platform for things like decentralized betting, contract for difference, and now arbitrary smart contracts (though we haven't seen that in production yet).
But looking at user-issued assets scenarios only (and everything around it), you are right, it is one sided as colored coins are clearly superior to global embedded consensus systems like Counterparty and Mastercoin.

Yes, this is not a well understood limitation of Counterparty.
There are many ways to build a protocol on the blockchain, otherwise there would just be one protocol. Counterparty and Open Assets take two different approaches. Open Assets works just like regular Bitcoin, so every assumption about Bitcoin holds true with Open Assets.
This is not the case with Counterparty. Counterparty uses Bitcoin as a timestamping system, which means the order of verification within the block is important. That means that a Counterparty transaction (e.g. asset transfer) may or may not be valid (as far as the Counterparty protocol is concerned) depending on the position at which it appears in the block relatively to other transactions.
Here is an example:
Transaction 1: A sends X to B
Transaction 2: B sends X to C
With regular Bitcoin and Open Assets, you can't have Transaction 2 before Transaction 1 because that means you are spending an output that doesn't exist yet, and miners will find the transaction invalid.
With Counterparty, both transactions may appear valid to miners regardless of the order because Counterparty doesn't rely on outputs. But if the miner includes transaction 2 before transaction 1 in the block, then transaction 2 is not valid, and transaction 2 is effectively cancelled. Note that there was no double spend at all in that scenario.
Since the order depends on the miner, you need to wait for the block before you can be sure the transaction will be accepted by the Counterparty protocol.
For more details, Mastercoin has detailed this behavior in [their blog](

In some cases, the issuer wants to reserve the right to issue more coins. But yes, a multisig address can be used if you want to prevent this.

The mobile wallet uses unconfirmed transactions exactly for that reason, and you can spend unconfirmed funds.
The web wallet lets you spend unconfirmed funds only from your own addresses. Otherwise, you can see the unconfirmed transactions (under the Transactions tab) but can't spend them, because they might not confirm, and would make your payment invalid.

You're spot on: you perfectly explained the true advantage of colored coins over Mastercoin and Counterparty.
The MaidSafe fiasco showed that Mastercoin won't be viable unless the liquidity grows by several orders of magnitude. MaidSafe had to buy 20% of all Mastercoins in existence in order to issue their coins. The price of MSC increased 90% as a result! In the end a significant amount of MaidSafe's investors money ended up in Mastercoin's owners pockets.

What you don't understand is that Open Assets has no concept of nodes (hence Sybil attack makes no sense in the context of OA). It uses bitcoin for networking and transaction validation, and Bitcoin is already protected against that.
Open Assets is just an embedded consensus layer on top of Bitcoin transactions.

@_date: 2015-05-29 00:17:25
What you might not understand is that embedded consensus is very different from "Proof of Work/Stake/..." consensus.
Every single client is verifying the OA validity of every transaction for itself, and every single client is able to identify invalid transactions. There is no trust involved in this.
This concept is not unique to OA. Counterparty, mastercoin, and every other colored coin implementation work the same way.

All of this is mostly inaccurate, has already been addressed a number of times, and to be honest we have better things to do than respond to those useless attacks, but here is a short response:
Thin client efficiency: the same problem exists with any other non-trivial colored coin implementation, this is not specific to Open Assets. This is also not really a problem. Thin client is interesting, but not a panacea. It is absolutely possible to build a thin client implementation of Open Assets. It just turns out very few people care about it.
Lack of non-reissuable assets: [This is a not a problem in practice]( Also, there **are** indeed ways to make non-reissuable assets without breaking consensus. We'll publish something about this once we have indications that someone has a genuine need for it, and it's not just some theoretical issue. As shown in the article linked above, non-reissuable assets (at protocol level) induce a false sense of security, and end up tricking users. This is why we have been trying to avoid them.
Compromises have to be made, and Open Assets is the most reasonable set of compromises. The industry-wide adoption of Open Assets as a de facto standard is a clear evidence of that.

1. This is already how it works today. If you buy stocks in a company, and the company decides to dilute existing shareholders by issuing more stocks, they can certainly do it.
2. Even if the asset were non-reissuable, instead, they could just create a new type of preferred stock (i.e. a new asset) late one night and achieve the same goal.
3. Also, the issuance of the stock would probably be controlled by both the company's key and NASDAQ's key (through multi-sig), as NASDAQ probably wants to retain some control of what's going on on their exchange.

You don't need a million nodes to do that, actually you don't need any node at all. Any normal bitcoin node already relays open assets transactions without checking the open assets payload.


The only input to that validation is the blockchain. There is no audit trail other than the blockchain.
And like you said, every other client will report that these transactions have been forged and non-valid, so the attack clearly failed.

You don't seem to understand colored coins.
Any colored coin client is able to identify invalid colored coin transactions. They just need to apply the (well defined) consensus rules to the transactions in the Blockchain.
There is no NASDAQ fork and there is no need to connect to their machines. All you need to connect to is the Blockchain.
Also colored coins do rely on Bitcoin's proof of work and digital signatures. It of course does not reimplement its own as it would be unnecessary.

If the OP_RETURN is invalid (for example, trying to forge coins), the open assets clients will detect it and consider the transaction invalid as far as open assets is concerned, resulting in the destruction of all the assets in input.
Have a look at the [protocol specification]( which spells out all the situations where this happens.

Yes you can, but not by accident.

Your question is why use the blockchain + OA versus a traditional non-blockchain based trust network?
It is not proprietary and has no gatekeeper. It lets everyone interact and settle transactions with a unified API. It's also immutable.
But you are right that using the blockchain is not always the best solution.


Yes in that case, the network is forked.
@_date: 2016-01-24 01:41:48
It's free and open source. [The wallet]( is also open source, and works on Android, though it is web-based and not native. Being open source, it can be customized and rebranded at will.

Yes miners can censor transactions, but as long as one accepts it, it will be mined (though it can take longer).
A way to avoid having to pay fees for every transaction is to use off-chain transactions. That's why I meant by "to some extent". It's unlikely that the whole stock exchange runs on the blockchain, because of fees and scaling reasons.
One interesting way to do off-chain transactions is to use lightning networks, which are fully compatible with open assets. Then you only need to pay fees when you open and close the channel.

It's valid but non-standard.

Flavien here. In their current plans, they will use the Bitcoin blockchain at least to some extent. It might not be the only technology, but the Bitcoin blockchain will be part of it.

The colored coin is listed here: 
@_date: 2015-03-09 15:17:21
Do you mean the physical asset backing the colored coin? If the physical asset is a bar of gold, there is no programmatic way to verify it's actually in a vault.
@_date: 2015-10-20 01:46:55
Same reasons listed above. Databases don't offer these features. Also, Openchain can use a distributed database as storage engine.
@_date: 2015-10-21 17:33:02
Sure but nothing forces custodians to follow what's on the blockchain. Like in the Paypal example.
Code cannot be law, unless we're talking about a Blockchain-native asset like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:11:23
Interesting, we'll look into it.
@_date: 2015-10-21 10:51:44
Let's be clear, Openchain **is** using a normal SQL database internally.
And since you mention it, Openchain is a sidechain.
@_date: 2015-10-21 20:38:08
It's a federated sidechain, like what Blockstream is doing, 2-way pegging using multisig.

Of course, but they can still refuse to do what they are legally bound to do, in which case, you still have to resolve it in court.
@_date: 2015-10-21 11:54:10
For a lack of a better term, I mean by "real-world asset" anything that is not a crypto-currency.
And yes, of course what I explained does not apply to crypto-currencies, which are the only asset type where distributed consensus is not only useful, but also required.
I hope it's clear we're not making a new crypto-currency. We believe Bitcoin is already the winner in that space.
@_date: 2015-03-09 14:46:39
I don't think this has anything to do with the thread.

Except there are digitally signed evidence on the chain that one "half" of the transaction happen. That can be used in court if it comes to that.
Generally, that wouldn't even be a problem though because Asset A validator and Asset B validator would only connect their chains if they agree to work with each other, and trust each other.
@_date: 2015-03-09 14:59:29
Good suggestion. We'll add a setting to turn on "Spend unknown unspent outputs".
@_date: 2015-03-09 15:46:00
That would require some serious firmware changes. They probably wouldn't do it unless there are a lot of users asking for it.
@_date: 2015-10-21 21:49:58
Private blockchains can be [open too](
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:10:18
This is used for things like the [Open Assets protocol]( (colored coins), where additional information about the asset is stored in that way.
@_date: 2015-10-20 10:50:23
Scalability only depends on the storage engine you are using. Fortunately, plenty of scale out databases exist so we don't have to reinvent the wheel. Using something like Cassandra, MongoDB or BigTables as the storage engine will provide very good scalability.
It's distributed because each asset lives on its own Openchain instance, with a different validator.
@_date: 2015-10-19 22:30:13
- There is an API so you can program against it.
- It's all protected by digital signatures, so you can prove who signed which transaction.
- It keeps the full history of all transactions, and makes it transparent. Anybody can double check everything.
- You can't tamper with it because it publishes a hash of the ledger every 10 minutes in the Bitcoin Blockchain.
- It probably scales better than a Google sheet (it can handle thousands of transactions per second on proper hardware).

Let me try to explain why distributed consensus is useless for any kind of real-world asset.
Imagine this situation: We have a PayPal ledger with multiple validators through distributed consensus. PayPal is one of those.
Alice pays Bob $1,000. PayPal happen to reverse the transaction. The other validators notice this, believe it shouldn't have been reverted, and fork the chain so that this reversal is not part of it. In the "main" chain, Bob still has $1,000.
Bob tries to withdraw the $1,000 from PayPal. Even though he owns $1,000 on the main chain, PayPal does not agree with this, as in their view of the ledger, Bob has $0. The only way to resolve this is to go to court.
Consensus here is useless, as the only chain that matters is the one PayPal is on. That's why in our implementation PayPal is the only one who can write to the chain. The other ones can observe what happens on there, and potentially use it against PayPal in court if needed.
@_date: 2015-10-21 10:36:22
There is one validator per asset. Multiple assets or currencies means multiple validators. With peer-to-peer debt tracking, you'd have one validator per lender (and each borrower is an observer of their lender's ledgers).

Yes it can be setup so that anyone with a public/private key pair can own an asset. By the way, that's how our demo instance is setup (
@_date: 2015-02-04 02:04:04
If you want to send colored coins to several recipients within the same transaction, the OP_RETURN payload is the limiting factor. With 40 byte, we were able to send to 34 recipients max per transaction. With 80 bytes, we can now send to 74 recipients per transaction.
@_date: 2015-10-21 12:43:38
It depends on how you configure your Openchain instance. Both setups are possible.
