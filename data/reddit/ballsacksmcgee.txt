I will be selling out if if the price paid is significantly below the market price. This is somewhat like a stock IPO where initially people staging the stock will dump on the market to lock in the immediate gain between the issue price and current market value, if those that are heavily overweight with btc after this auction can realize huge initial gains by dumping on the exchange then fully expect that they will.
Further to this it's possible they would even place option bets to additionally profit from tanking the market. 
If it's close or above market price the above in my opinion would not occur
Disc. Holding btc, DYOR!

You are most definitely correct about the directors raking in the cash, however many of these entrepreneurs are really showing their lack of business experience and I would almost certainly expect they have naively crossed into some illegal practice . Especially after hearing about BFL accounting today lol

Hey, good job and well done. You have learned first hand the value of risk management in investing and how often things dont go as planned. Theres no one I know out there that has not failed in the world of investing, ive been wiped out once before coming back and i hope you will return once things look a bit rosier :)
Just make sure before you sell that it is your reasoning as an investor telling you now is the time to sell , rather than the emotion which we all get in times like these, but need to control.

This stock is so overbought its ridiculous. Anyone thinking of purchasing should seriously consider if they need the money, because there is a definite sharp correction coming rite up for AM.
Do your own analysis of the stock , dont listen to horseshit threads like these.
