Is this just Blockchain.info reading in the data wrong? Haven't seen that happen before, that block shouldn't exist for another 20 minutes!
@_date: 2014-03-05 10:14:44
Just noticed the number of connected nodes on Blockchain.info is far lower than usual (70 at the moment). I'm guessing some software had to be reset

Look here: 
Nice little exchange been set up for exactly this

I'm in the UK too. We always hear about it being cracked down on whenever the government wants some good news for people to hear but they're always going to be one step behind the big corporations.

Website looks great, looking forward to trying it out.
@_date: 2013-05-26 12:40:22
How many confirmations do you wait for?
@_date: 2013-07-02 14:40:04
I received the email on 20th June asking me to provide my details. A second email on 26th June told me that I was free to make the withdrawal which I did that evening, and I got the funds this morning. Very easy in the end, I hope everyone else gets their money back soon!
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:11:03
Actually there is still some lag despite no trading for an hour :)
@_date: 2013-11-29 11:58:36
I'd love to know the answer to this too, can anyone chip in?
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:35:50
Well I just made $20 dollars so the 10 min lag isn't all bad :)

Isn't this irrelevant? Why would all of these companies be aiming for the same valuation? ASICMINER gets its valuation from its weekly dividend value which gives it currently a large ROI. Companies reach a valuation based on the... value of the company. Comparing companies based on market cap is useless imho

The article is dated yesterday... still not sure

I live in Leamington and got to Warwick Uni, hello there!
@_date: 2013-03-20 16:41:30
Me right now: 
@_date: 2013-08-02 15:56:39
Quick and easy :)
@_date: 2013-05-29 10:38:14
I would hold onto them, the price is looking very stable right now and the bitcoin ecosystem is growing daily as more businesses starting to accept them. The future looks promising :) And if you choose to use them to dodge taxes that's up to you, but its yet another risk
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:59:43
i'd love to see this
@_date: 2013-03-23 10:29:31
 is a great place to start with to deal directly with buyers
@_date: 2013-08-19 14:41:59
Thanks for letting me know!
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:42:36
I've found localbitcoins.com to be good as its quick although you pay a bit of a premium. Otherwise I use transferwise.com to convert GBP to EUR which I deposit into Bitcoin24
@_date: 2013-05-27 12:04:14
You still make money if you hold it the round before it explodes though, and you make more money that way
@_date: 2013-04-02 14:10:41
hehe went and watched that one straight after, don't understand all the dislikes
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:54:50
@_date: 2013-08-19 13:10:09
Thank you, didn't know about that place, will do that now
@_date: 2013-05-29 10:11:11
What time was it mentioned?
@_date: 2013-04-08 15:03:22
The Lag Monster is rearing its head, I hope there are some big orders in there to push this thing up :)
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:46:36
Judging by a previous comment: "Brand new! We replaced them with the servers EA used for Simcity's launch. Should work great." Yes
@_date: 2013-08-28 22:50:22
Do you wait for any confirmations?
@_date: 2013-04-23 11:12:50
Happy birthday mate :D
Here's your cake! 
@_date: 2013-05-01 16:41:46
Yep I've received mine too, think it was the same day
@_date: 2013-08-19 15:36:24
Sounds awesome, I second the idea of releasing the code in some way
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:01:12
At 5am I appreciate a laugh!
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:10:15
There is trading lag showing up and there hasn't been a trade in the last hour...
@_date: 2013-03-23 10:39:31
If you look at the 30 day chart, the price is still well above where it should be:  But considering how high its been in the past few days, people will see this low price and assume it will have to return to it and will therefore buy so it might actually happen.
@_date: 2013-07-31 13:49:01
Oh yeah lol i didn't spot that :P
@_date: 2013-03-14 20:59:29
I had this problem on iPhone Safari and switching to Chrome solved it

I do quite a lot of eBay-ing myself so know how frustrating it can be when a customer claims that the item never arrived. I now use tracked shipping for almost all of my items. I would never want to do this to someone else, I just want what I paid for! 
However it is odd that neither letter has turned up, its a tiny percentage probability that both could get lost. 
Before today I had received a total of 4 replies from him. The 1st was when the original letter didn't arrive. The 2nd was when I enquired again 2 weeks later. The 3rd stated that it should take 5 days to 2 weeks. The 4th asked for my new address for the 2nd letter.
It does annoy me that it took this post to get some action out of him and he was deservedly upset in his reply. I just hope he can work out what happened.
@_date: 2013-06-16 16:58:01
What've you got ordered? I'm waiting on a little Single but happy enough for the moment. If you ordered in the last month or 2 then that's something else
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:28:45
3am as well in the UK :)
@_date: 2013-06-15 18:50:08
I've got 8 coming my way and happy to part with them for 1BTC (50% value) if anyone is interested 
@_date: 2013-04-02 12:33:03
@_date: 2013-03-23 10:46:12
"Steady growth" :O
@_date: 2013-06-17 07:24:14
Huge amount of respect for this, they're on page 8 of a 244 page official magazine!
@_date: 2013-07-04 11:14:04
That was really quick, thanks :D
@_date: 2013-05-29 10:17:23
If you're in the UK you might be thinking of this
@_date: 2013-05-26 12:53:13
Thanks, I like the site and the idea, keep it up!
@_date: 2013-07-03 15:54:26
That was my thought exactly. People who have done very well out of this investment will probably want to buy a mansion or something, unfortunately not many of them are available for BTC yet :P
@_date: 2013-04-02 13:08:07
Yeah I did as well actually. Received them today and then saw this. Was going to sell them on in the UK but now they're rarer I want to hold onto them
@_date: 2013-07-03 16:39:20
My thought was more along the lines of: people who are buying right now are likely to be long-term Bitcoin holders looking to get a return instead of just sitting on their coins; and those selling may be likely to convert some of their profit to fiat. I know that it is speculation but it makes sense to me at least
@_date: 2013-08-19 13:25:12
Yeah I'll definitely consult there first in the future. I hope anyone reading this sees that link so these mistakes are avoided.
@_date: 2013-03-20 15:48:41
You've converted 750TH/s to 7.57x10^13 when it should be 7.5x10^14. Puts you a factor of 10 out. I get 0.0216 BTC/day
@_date: 2013-07-17 11:37:02
I love  great stuff!
@_date: 2013-03-22 23:20:44
Now only 64,000. Things can change pretty quick round here
@_date: 2013-08-28 22:58:20
Considering the amounts are small I'd suggest going with 0 confirmations. I'm sat here waiting now getting bored
