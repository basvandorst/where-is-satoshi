Doge for me is a fun side experiment. I made quite a bit a few times, then lost a good chunk of that in the current dip. Since Doge is really a novelty, I'm not buying extra like I would with BTC. 
If it goes up, great. If not, no worries, we sponsored a NASCAR and a Bobsled team - what a fun social experiment.

Yeah absolutely.
I have a bit of BTC squirreled away long-term, and Doge is the one I'm happy to try day-trading and donating with, for funzies.

Being a smartarse uses up energy that could be used for more productive things...

No, it's not. It's a pittance.
But the fact that 1) I got it for free as a gift and 2) it's tripled in a fortnight is quite nice. 
And I wanted to spread the thinking to others to see if it'll get them introduced into Bitcoins too.
Thanks for shitting on that parade.

You talk like you're in a multi level marketing scam.

Do I judge events based on the way they choose to advertise and present themselves? Bloody right I do, yes. 
That flyer is an indication of how much of a fuck they give and, therefore, how much I give.

What's your wallet address for paying in? :)

Very true, but not many realise it. All the 'stock' apps are becoming Google-branded. SMS becomes Hangouts, email becomes Gmail...
It's getting much harder to make a vanilla Android device without going through the Google-approved process and getting their versions of the basic apps.
Still, I bloody love my Android phones.

haha that's not a problem, I don't want anyone to pay me, I want to give a couple of dollars away to get people started :)
Have you tried  My brother just bought 1 BTC there.

Can you both gain or lose money? Then yeah it is.
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:17:51
Already there, mate.

I love the idea of the event but this is the worst flyer in the world. 
I live in London, so I'm conflicted
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:29:21
Of course it's gambling. Is there a guarantee that you won't lose? No. So it's informed, low yield low risk gambling.

Sure but the point is he set a chosen goal and it was rapidly reached.
Logarithms don't come into this case.
