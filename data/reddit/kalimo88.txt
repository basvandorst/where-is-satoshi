Props! I put my only $200 in and then watched it drop today. I'm hopeful it rises. Can I ask are you able to afford that from bitcoin originally or from work/personal funds? Just curious :)

I feel you! Except it was only my $200, but it was literally all I have to my name. I'm hopeful it will rise. Sending good vibes to you and all our bitcoin buds!

I only have $9 but Im investing it. Someone please help me do this! I will never have $100 to invest but dammit my $9 will get me somewhere won't it? Any help would be greatly appreciated and I'd gladly give a percentage of my earnings. We can discuss privately. I need an ELI5 approach to this.

Agreed. I started with literally $4.50 and put it a little more at a time until i topped at $200. I was buying as often as I could. It would be nice to have some cushion.

I guess saying it the way I did sounds more dramatic than I intended. It was my savings so far. I had been putting in whatever change I could together and decided to go for it. I don't regret it. I just REALLY hope it goes back up lol. When I said that it's because anything extra I have is usually a few dollars or cents here and there. I make just enough for bills and necessities. When I decided to put it all into Bitcoin I knew it was risky. It's ok. I wasn't saving for anything in particular.

Hey, everything is a lot for me right now. I'd be happy to have $30 extra. I appreciate everyone explaining this new concept to me. I'm definitely going to just put in what I can when I can. Thanks for the help!

Easy enough! I didn't know where to start buying it. I was able to buy $4.5 worth. It's a little start!
