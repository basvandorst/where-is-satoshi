I will admit I am unaware of the location the interview took place (**his** home, hotel room, office or a place organised by the interviewer) or if he was restrained or in some way barred from leaving.  He made no request that indicated he couldn't leave.
Edit: No, the whole 60 minutes of the tape was released but on the what was heard "He made no request that indicated he couldn't leave."

Test group B required holding 10,000SJCX in your wallet to recieve SJCX rewards. Storj never asked for your keys. You could particiapte without the SJCX, but not recieve rewards. About 1,500 "farmers" participated.
During the several months that the test group ran, the market value of sjcx rose, like many alts have, while the value of bitcoin has been stagnant.  Non of the famers lost USD.
Requriements for earning rewards in test group C haven't been announced yet. But, I think the requirement helps to limit freeloaders looking for something for nothing.

I've worked at mines for 10 years and putting a mine into "care and maintainance" is the last thing you do. Some very large costs are fixed, such as servicing debt. Another example is Coal mines in Queensland Australia have "take or pay" contracts with local railways. Downsizing, stockpiling, hedging, renegotiating lines of credit, minimising operating losses all coming first.
Edit: Thinking about it, Many large chinese miners would have used credit to purchase their miners.

Banning cash and allowing your population to only conduct their financial affairs through a for-profit private financial organizations is not an ideal solution. If those organizations aren't compelled to provide free basic financial services without discrimination, then the goverment is effectively imposing a tax in the form of fees which is given to private organizations.
Here's a video posted by the bank of england. This particular part of the video discusses digital currency.

They can't ban cash until they have a suitable replacement. What would be good replacement, maybe some sort of hack proof traceable digital system that would give them a realtime view of money flow through the economy. This is something elements of crypto currencys could provide. But it would need years of research before trusting it with billions of euros of value. Maybe us and commerical/investment banks can pay for the reseach and take the risks.
Once a replacement is agreed upon Central banks will just request goverments ban competing systems. And why wouldn't a goverment do what was in the interests of it's central bank. 
Alternatively, if it's central bank indicated that it would like to see research performed on crypto currencies, why prematurely ban it.

Skype was once p2p. So p2p messenging has been proven. Why not intergrate an spv client into a p2p messenging app. If the "server" is only to distribute Gemz and not collect user data, then ok, no problem.
No need to reinvent the wheel by writing a brand new messenging app. Extending and rebranding an existing solution with an spv client might be cheaper, faster and more secure. spika (with server) and textsecure are two that come to mind.

1. I want to be wealthy and influential. 
2. I've cut my teeth with an ISP business (and viaga). I know how to make money.
3. Bitcoin/fintech is the place to be. I can get in on the ground floor and ride the wave. 
4. Mining is capital intensive. I’ve minimized my risk by selling packetized mining contracts (hashlets) and maybe minimized capex by purchasing hashing power from other pools. 
5. I forecast that by the time my mining fleet nears end of life the market will be saturated. I can get a better ROI elsewhere.
6. Why settle for a crypto mining company, when I could have my own currency and a transaction processing company. Kiss my ass MasterCard. 
7. I'm in the US and acutely aware that any regulatory authority will publicly fuck me over if I don't tread very carefully. Need to spend lots of money on lawyers to ensure compliance.
8. Move my customer base over to mining HP which can be done on obsolete mining hardware. Then move them over to POS. I can run POS from a cloud.
9. Mine the shit out of BTC with my mining fleet then shut them down before that wanker sues for none FCC compliant PSU’s.  Sell off or lease out me shiny new datacenter

Project Maelstrom: Goals 
"Enhance User Privacy Most users have concerns about services they use being able to identify them. Even at the minimum settings, most popular authentication methods today uniquely identify users and usually give out personal information such as their name. Project Maelstrom will put your concerns to rest in three ways:
Unique IDs provided to applications cannot be used to track you between applications unless you allow it
You can deny an application any or all information it requests.
You will be able to set up separate profiles for separate uses, such as personal and work use, within one account.
"Hello, new user! You look like you could use a Maelstrom Network account. Why don't you get started by connecting with one of our various and sundry foreign credential providers? You probably already have one of these. If you have more than one, you will be presented with the opportunity to attach more later."

I'm an expat too, but live in a developing country. Today I transfered some money from my local bank account to my bank account in my home country, using my local bank's internet banking service.
 I got a phone call from my local bank a few hours later. The lady said that their intermediary bank wouldn't accept the description I'd writen in the transaction, so they won't process the transaction until I come into the bank personally with a signed letter requesting the description to be changed. I asked her to cancel the transaction, and I'd create a new transaction with a different description. "Oh, no you have to come into the bank with a signed letter requesting the transaction be cancelled" was the reply.... "Can you give me an example of a description your intermediary will accept?" I asked. "Something more descriptive" she replied.... 
So the problems I face are:
1. Local banks still requiring paper based systems of verification.
2. intermediary Banks in 3rd countries trying to comply with AML and KYC regs.
3. a goverment that is not crypto currency savvy.
4. a goverment that needs to support it's local currency, so crypto currencies can be perceived to pose a threat.
The only crypto related business I think I could run here would be a ripple gateway. But due to point 3, I'd need to tread carefully, cause the initial reaction would be suspicion.

Let's suppose I am a professional or post graduate in computer sciences or mathematics. I work or want to work as a quant or HFT.
I notice that a majority of the bitcoin market players are just bots. Crude bots compared to those used in the finance industry or that I have the knowledge to write. They use a set of predefined rules that execute when certain market statistics converge; I wouldn't even call it narrow AI.
 
I decide that I want to manipulate market statistics in such a way that I can effectively recruit bots to work for me. I've seen flash crashes and know that when enough bots work together they can move markets.
I also theorize that some bots use market statistics from other exchanges when executing their rules, so recruiting enough bots on one or two exchanges could recruit bots on other exchanges.
The challenge: Recruit bots and build enough momentum that bots start influencing market statistics themselves, thus recruiting more bots and moving the market in the direction I choose.
I think it is doable with the right knowledge. Maybe social influence network theory can be applied to bots ?

**Email from ANX support regarding my application**
Hi, [REMOVED]
Thank you for submitting the verification documents.
Kindly note that your address proof is in electronic version.
In order to further proceed the verification, would you please submit,
1) A clear, non-electronic, proof of address (issue date within 3 months) document that meets the following requirements:
- Bank Statement
- Utility Bill for utilities consumed at your home address
2) An image of yourself holding your valid government issued photo ID
Please note that:
1) Documents should be in colour, clear and visible in their entirety; and
2) Proof of residency document must be a scanned image of a paper document, not an electronic substitute.
 
3) Electronic versions of proof of address can not be accepted.
**My Reply**
Hi, Katherine.
I have a few question's.
1. I'm not sure I understand "non-electronic". Is a digital photo ok ?   
2.  The goverment doesn't issue paper proof of residency documents. All residents are issued ID cards. My alien registration card is my proof of residency. 
3. I rent an apartment. My landlord pays Utilities bills.  All residents in [REMOVED] are required by law to register where they live with the goverment. [REMOVED]. This is why my alien registration card has my address on the back and the certificate I sent is issued from my local goverment office on request.  If I want to open a bank account, register a car, or renew my [REMOVED] visa I need to present an original certificate.  
**ANX support reply**
Dear [REMOVED]
1. Yes, you are right.
2&amp;3. We understand your status. Then would you mind to provide your bank statement for verification again as below? Thanks
Please log into ANX, go to Settings&gt; Verify and then upload your documents again.

WEST CHESTER, Pa.—When Dean Moore ran into roadblocks with a request for mortgage relief, he did what many people do: He sat down at his kitchen table to bang out an angry letter.
This one, though, had enormous consequences.
The letter has thrust Mr. Moore, a chemist, and his wife, Ann Marie Fletcher-Moore, a part-time bookstore manager, into a high-stakes battle over whether HSBC Holdings PLC must release a secret report on its compliance with a $1.9 billion money-laundering settlement.
Mr. Moore sent his letter in November to U.S. District Judge John Gleeson, who is overseeing HSBC’s settlement. In it, he said releasing the report would help him show HSBC had systemic issues that led the bank to fumble its record-keeping duties in his mortgage dispute.
On the surface, the Moores’ mortgage complaint would seem to have little to do with money laundering—and Judge Gleeson has said the letter was just one among a flood of complaints about HSBC he has received from around the world. But for reasons he didn’t explain, the judge decided to elevate the legal importance of Mr. Moore’s letter. In late January, he shocked the banking industry by ordering the report released after saying the letter constituted a motion to unseal it.

The disclosure would be the first ever for this type of case and would shine a light on an increasingly common practice for banks accused of breaking the law. Instead of being prosecuted, banks typically enter into settlements under which they often agree to be overseen by monitors whose detailed judgments are kept secret. Judge Gleeson’s order has the potential to dial back that confidentiality, opening a new channel of information that prosecutors say could threaten the viability of such settlements in future cases.
HSBC and Justice Department prosecutors have opposed the release, saying it wouldn’t do much to help Mr. Moore with his mortgage predicament. Judge Gleeson, in his order to unseal the report, said that was irrelevant.
“The Monitor’s Report could have no useful information for Moore, and he—as a member of the public—would still have a right to see it,” the judge said.
The bank is appealing the ruling, but already it may be having an impact. HSBC disclosed last week that the January report by independent monitor Michael Cherkasky found instances of potential financial crime and had “significant concerns” about the bank’s pace of progress in complying with the money-laundering settlement.
The Moores say the experience has been surreal. The couple lives in this Philadelphia suburb with their four children, two dogs and a 15-year-old rabbit and had never spent much time in court other than for jury duty. They have nevertheless held their own against a phalanx of lawyers from the British bank and the Justice Department. A recent hearing in a Brooklyn federal court “was like ‘Law and Order,’” said Mrs. Fletcher-Moore, who is 50 years old.
The Justice Department and HSBC declined to comment on the Moore family.
HSBC admitted in its 2012 settlement that it failed to catch at least $881 million in drug-trafficking proceeds laundered through its U.S. bank and that its staff stripped data from transactions with Iran, Libya and Sudan to evade U.S. sanctions.
The Moores knew little of that when they first reached out for help with a financial squeeze. The couple said they had trouble keeping up with the $3,000-plus monthly mortgage payment on their $525,000 home after the cost of Mrs. Fletcher-Moore’s treatment for breast cancer forced them to file for bankruptcy.
The mortgage was administered by HSBC, and the Moores say they wrote to the bank starting in 2008 asking it to temporarily lower the 7% interest rate. They said the lender appeared receptive, only for its representatives to misplace documents needed to complete their application for a loan modification several times.
Frustrated, the Moores researched the bank online last year and stumbled upon news of the money-laundering settlement and the monitor’s secret report. The Moores say they believe the report details faulty internal controls like those they encountered when trying to modify their loan.
In his letter to Judge Gleeson, Mr. Moore wrote that his experience trying to modify his mortgage led him to believe HSBC was violating the terms of a mortgage-related settlement and asked the judge to release the monitor’s report to help him prove it.
His decision to consider the motion took the Moores from outside commentators to major participants in a federal case. The couple spent days researching the obscure cases the government and HSBC cited in their effort to keep the report secret.
“The Amodeo case was the real kicker for me,” Mr. Moore said, referring to United States vs. Amodeo, a suit involving a report similar to the monitor’s on union-related corruption. The opposing side’s interpretation of the court case was “what we call in the lab cherry-picking the data,” he said.
The Moores’ motion came before the court in January. They drove to the hearing in Brooklyn in their black Mitsubishi. Mr. Moore, a 52-year-old sales director for a chemical company, rode shotgun, tweaking his legal arguments in a small notebook. The oral arguments lasted just under an hour. Later that month, Judge Gleeson ruled in the couple’s favor.
If his ruling stands, it would be “the first time we get to see what happens after a bank settles a prosecution,” said Brandon Garrett, a professor at University of Virginia’s law school who has studied the monitor system.
A ruling could eventually render other banks’ reports public as well, he said. Credit Suisse Group AG and Standard Chartered PLC are among those also under monitoring arrangements.
HSBC and the Justice Department are still fighting to keep the report private and have appealed Judge Gleeson’s ruling to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. An appeals court ruling could be months away. “I feel like a very small boat in a very large ocean,” Mr. Moore wrote at one point, in a letter responding to some of their arguments.
With the litigation grinding on, Mr. Moore stays up many nights to the early morning hours penning new letters to the court. Mrs. Fletcher-Moore edits them the next day for grammar—a system the high-school sweethearts used when he was in graduate school.
Judge Gleeson, who said Mr. Moore has done “admirably” in court so far, recently suggested he retain David Schulz, a prominent First Amendment attorney who was willing to represent the couple for free. The Moores accepted.

TL:DR  


the opportunity for incumbents to gain a natural advantage over challengers. Our model
predicts that risk neutral voters will simply prefer whichever candidate is most proximate
to their own ideology; however, as risk aversion increases (whether it is from individual risk
aversion or candidate-specific risk aversion), voters become increasingly likely to prefer the
incumbent, even if the challenger is more proximate to their own ideological beliefs.

A megabyte is a logical unit of measurement.Simplistic eli5 logic is 2mb &gt; 1mb and 2mb != 8mb. Arguing otherwise is a no-win proposition. Switch to an arguement highlighting reduced transaction sizes. eg: "75% **Smaller** onchain transactions", "up to 4x **more** transactions per block". As eli5 logic dictates if something is smaller, more fits into given a logical unit.  
But the time for this type of politician speak is probably passed.

That's quite elegant and idealistic. If I ran an organization that controlled 100,000's or Millions of dollars of hashing power, I would say the same thing publicly. 
Privately amongst my colleagues and investors I'd congratulate the community for proposing to give myself and a dozen other Mining pools a small ability to influence the entire system and one that wasn't publicly requested. While it may not be directly monetizable at present, it does add value to my company. And I can dicuss with other pool operators how best our industry can benefit. If bitcoin grows, so will the value of that influnence and the harder it will be to take it away. If I appear to be a good guardian maybe I can garner more trust and greater influence in other matters.
I live in an developing country where I see corruption and people gaming the system everyday. So maybe I feel I'm more of a realist when it comes to human nature where money and power are concerned.

@_date: 2015-08-27 15:34:14
Yes, It rasies a few questions
1. A mining pool owner gets the power of a vote while the contributors to the pool provide the hashing power, but don't get a vote. For example Slush's pool. ..   isn't that like POS "nothing at stake" problem.
2. VC 's don't get a vote but provide more money to the ecosystem than miners, so arguably have more of a vested interest in seeing bitcoin succeed ?
3. Could Janet Yellen (or VISA/Paypal/Mastercard) pay a few hundred million to intel to create mining hardware that will give her majority voting rights ?

Bitcoin was designed to be robust in an adversarial environment. It's primary non-mathematical strategy to achieve it, is to minimize the influence &amp; power of any group with an aligned economic incentive via decentralization. Bitcoin got a lot of things right, unfortunately a non-asic resistant POW algo was not one of them. But is pioneers can't be expected to be perfect.
Speculators are trend followers and Bitcoin is opt-in, no one forces you to buy it. Speculators will follow the ideologically driven community. That's the flow of information in herds.
I hate to give NYA members ideas, but they need to learn political science and herd theory. Also, sponsor development of a green fields rival bitcoin client that offers competitive features, like modularity, but this would decentralize development &amp; power more. Not a quick fix, cheap &amp; easy option like forking core github and using a stick to herd core into following.

Electric company power meters, Bus stop Electronic advertising billboards, The local college has moister sensors placed in peoples garden for research proposes, etc.
To buy temporary internet access as the bus passes, each of the devices only needs to have a casual transitory relationship to pay and use it's internet service, rather that their owner needing a formal relationship with the bus company. Much less friction.

There's no technical mechanisms to allow the economic majority (end users) to vote, only political ones. There are for node operators though.   
Miners are not a privileged group. Neither are pool operators, but if either group are also node operators, then they have a vote.  
I think most people that live in democracies believe industry and big business  shouldn't have a greater influence on the running of a country than the economic majority, and I apply that bias to this issue.

We are conditioned to accept an inflationary currency because it is how virtually every country since world war two has been run. But it's a short period relative to human history.
Inflationary currency encourages bringing forward purchases, increases velocity of money(the churn + consumerism speeds up technological advancement). But, it also discourages savings, encourages debt and needs support of a growing population. Look at japan for an example of a culture in the later stage of the cycle. Less disciplined countries will far worse.
Deflationary currency will encourage putting off purchases, discourage debt, encourage savings, slow tech advancement. I don't know if a shrinking population would encourage inflation, sounds plausible. 
Everything goes in cycles. I assume the deflationary currency would encourage a slower longer stable cycle.

The economic majority is a fraction of the economy in it's totality. Inclusive of anyone that owns a fraction of the available supply of bitcoins, and entities involved in the production and consumption of goods and services.
Peeps not running a node will have an oportunity to "vote" if a HF occurs, whenever they feel alienated or not algined with the ideology of the community, or if they do/not see a speculative return on their investments.  
Owning Bitcoin is a choice and there are alternatives. If the supply/demand equilibrium pivots from bull to bear after a HF with one surviving chain or coins from one or the other chain are offered at a discount. These are indicators of the economic majority voting in their own self interests, whether ideological or financially motivated.
All in all, Most of the community where attracted to bitcoin because of personal beliefs, whether they are ideological or financial. if bitcoin no longer aligns with them, then people will seeks alternatives.

You take things at face value and stare at your feet because you are too stoned to see straight.  
To see what a majority of the miners want, you need to understand their cultural bias.

Think of it as a computer program or flow chart for ease of imagination. Just like a computer program or regular contract is written for a specific requirement, so is a smart contract. So... the below example is just that, an example.
**Parties:**  
Seller  
Buyer  
Shipping company (transport &amp; tracking)  
customs/tax collector (import duties in recieving country) 
 
insurance company (insuring goods in transit)  
mediation company (mediates any disputes)  
bank (provides funding to buyer)
Smart Contracts can interact with other smart contracts or services, but I'll focus on a single/primary/principal contract.
SC = smart contract.
*All transactions are time stamped and imutable records. A property of blockchains
1.Seller creates a SC containing terms &amp; conditions and procedures the transaction must follow including dispute mediation.  
2.buyer sends a transaction to the SC signalling acceptance.  
3.bank sends a transaction to the SC signalling acceptance.  
4.Insurance company  sends a transaction to SC signalling acceptance. (insurance claim procedure could be specified in the SC or handled via a separate SC)  
5.mediation company sends a transaction to SC signalling acceptance. (Dispute mediation procedure could be specified in the SC or handled via a separate SC)  
6.Bank sends payment to SC.  
7.Seller sends a transaction to SC signalling goods ready to be collected.  
8.Shipping company sends a transaction to SC signalling goods have been collected.  
9.Shipping company sends a transactions to SC signalling location of goods.
10.customs/Tax collector sends a transaction to SC signalling duty to be paid on goods. (Import duty payment procedure could be specified in the SC or handled via a separate SC)  
11.Shipping company sends a transactions to SC signalling location of goods.  
12.Shipping company sends a transactions to SC signalling delivery of goods.  
13.buyer sends a transaction to SC signalling receipt of goods. 
 
14.buyer sends a transaction to SC signalling acceptance of goods. (automatically notifying insurance and mediation companies that their roles in the SC are finished)  
15.SC sends payment to seller and/or any other parties the contract specifies (Customs, insurance policy fee, mediation company fee, etc).

The coin is backed by the network's utility. When the speculation stage has died down. The valuation of a Bitcoin will be the result of the usefulness of the network.  
 Because there is a specific number of coins and slowing inflation rate. The more useful the network, the more demand, the higher the valuation, and vice versa.

Exchanges make money on trading fees. If they feel there's a market for the coins, they'll add them. But, miners make money selling coins, so they need to choose the most profitable chain to mine on. Which is where demand from the public comes into the equation.

CSW purposely forgets to playout his argument to it's ultimate conclusion, because it doesn't suite his agenda.  
 It's a loss of trust in the network, and almost immediate long term losses for all miners, as bitcoin's value drops as fast, as news of the attack spreads on social media.  
This article highlights why he can't be satoshi. Everything I've read that he's written is practical, not imaginative. He takes an existing idea (in this case, 51% attacks) and describes it, adds complexity to it, describes a method. Regurgitates learned information. But it is never a new paradigm, an approach to a subject from an unrealized perspective, a genius insight. Never an aha moment.
edit:spelling, formatting.

SEC will still pursue operators if they think something is fishy. Winning cases gives them precedents and jurisdiction via common law rather than legislation.
Just this week they won their case against GAW miners. I assume they claimed jurisdiction via claiming definition of of hashing contracts as  "purported to offer shares to investors in their digital bitcoin mining operation".

I live in a developing country with a large rural population, and one of the illogical practices used by telecos is to charge higher rates for internet in rural areas because their infrastructure costs are higher, yet local incomes are lower. So obviously infrastructure utilization is lower and ROI's are longer.  How they rationalize this logic when they don't use it for mobile voice communications (and backhaul voice over the same infrastructure) is nuts.  
802.11af &amp; 802.22 might force them to change.

There are a few levels to the answer.  
First, there are multiple bitcoin software clients.  
The network relies on consensus rules, to keep consensus. Anyone can propose and get coded up new consensus rules for all software clients, but a super majority of node operators need to agree to the rules for them to activated (HF &amp; SF details not within scope of this answer).  
But, if one software client implements an sql db service or to run over a new network protocol, this doesn't involve consensus rules and can be unique to the cilent without affecting the network as a whole.

Time might be right to call everybody's bluff. 
Economics often trumps principals, and those with more money at risk will put aside their principal first (not hodl'ers, they'll get coins on both chains).  
Likewise, fear drives the risk adverse to safety. They will turn to core as it's a known quantity. You may find this interesting:

Not really.  The economic incentive for users is always based on cost, the incentive for miners is always based on profit. This puts miners at a disadvantage, as there will always be someone seeking profit to replace them. This doesn't apply to users.  
Ideology isn't written in it's code. game theory and economic incentivization are.
