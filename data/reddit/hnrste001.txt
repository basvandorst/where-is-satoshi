Said like a true patriotic American, good for you! Just like the British 100 years ago, and before them the Spanish, the Portuguese....

The current policies are for now, and hold little correlation to what may be done in the future. Their economy (and policies) are changing significantly, they're no longer focussing on dominance of manufacturer, but rather on IP and internal development, which is the change the west should take note of.

Wars are generally based on territorial claims, preventative threats, or religious motivations. I can't think of any major power of who would want a war with the US based on any of these.
Changes in the balance of power doesn't require war, it just expedites the process

Definitely not any time soon! But in another 100 years its not impossible, as what happened to the pound.
Individual countries will always use their own currency internally (pound, euros etc) to maintain a level of control, gather tax etc where they have a currency worth using. USD is the base currency for most global trade and currently much of the developing world use USD as a base even internally. But Chinese influence is growing in poorer countries, which are also the ones with faster population growth. The influence has an effect on internal decision making, and when reserve banks decide to reduce their holdings of USD reserves in favour of something else (let's hope its Crypto, but it could be Rembini or something else), the dollar could devalue rapidly. I understand its something the US is quite scared of, so they lobby to keep the dollar as the global reserve currency (hopefully someone with better knowledge can give more detail?)
Its fun speculating, but also we can be thankful that we're alive in a period of relative calm and prosperity. When (if) these changes occur it could cause a lot of economic turmoil, something a few generations from here will have to deal with. Hence buying some crypto for one's kids to inherit seems like such a good plan for many - long term view!

Just the normal evolution of geopolitics and the global balance of power, which generally leads to the dominant currency of trade. Because it happens slowly and its rare to see significant changes global superpowers in a single generation unless there is a major war, the common assumption is that the status quo will remain. True in short-term, but not in the long term.
Only 100 years ago people were having the same discussion about the pound, with some suggesting the dollar could take over?! Crazy talk, since America was just a bunch of immigrants who made wars with themselves! The dollar only became the global currency mid century, so that's not a long time in the position (relatively speaking, compared to those before).
Given the growing influence of the Chinese, they are looking increasingly likely overtake the US as the global center of power one day. Not in our lifetime, but it seems fairly likely at some point in the future

I do hope you're right!

Amazing how few people realise how likely this scenario is!
