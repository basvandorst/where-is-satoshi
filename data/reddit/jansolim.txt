you offer them that they have taken away part of our money and have covered the losses, it is not good too
I sincerely sympathize with all who has lost here, and I have also lost everything to an owl bitcoins here, but I am not ready to give the last that managed to be kept (if they in general want to return to us though that) their pause very much strains, during this time they could draw there though as to undercut even what was stolen
