Wouldn't LIFO be my best choice? Since I have a small stash of old, cheaper coins?

Stallman's "dream world" now runs much of the backbone of every major business in the world.

This is one of the oldest, largest dispensaries in CO. There is no way they would risk their name and company if they hadn't researched the legality.

[CharlieTheKid]( and [DavidBurns1979]( are shills. They are brand new users, and they are trying to get people on this form to do illegal things or to scam them. These folks are scum.

They could stash bitcoins at retail locations, put supply stores inside starbucks, etc. The retailer would get foot traffic.

All jokes aside, "don't spend it all at once" is really bad advice for paper wallets.

Thank you for the detailed response. I must say that I'm so angry right now.

Give your family a copy of your encrypted wallet. Keep the password in a known place that they do not have meaningful access to until you die.

Ditto. It took a little bit of complaining, but they made me whole.
@_date: 2014-04-04 03:12:36
But "way too far" for whom? Stallman has very specific beliefs about how free software should exist, and he is committed to those beliefs. It also happens to be that those beliefs have spurred an entire ecosystem of wonderful, industrial-strength software.
When people complain that Stallman isn't pragmatic, it reminds of me of people who complain that bitcoin isn't pragmatic because it is easier to buy lattes with credit cards. They don't see the bigger picture.

Hey, for what it's worth, I think it's great that you did the interview, and I think that while Trish might not be a "friend" she does treat you with respect. Trish is a journalist, and she needs to point out your legal issues otherwise she is not giving the full picture to the public. She did of course try to get you to answer some questions about the legal issues, but this clearly was not a hit piece on you.
Keep on keepin' on.

I thought that the idea that bitcoin may be effectivley replaced by another coin was widely held in our circles. I've taken the recent blockchain tech fixation as just a variant on that idea.
@_date: 2011-06-22 02:06:31
I think that the net profits you are referring to are underwhelming. Check out the [daily tarp update]( Then take into consideration the [extra tax breaks]( that some of the banks got.
Why couldn't the government have bailed out the consumer?
@_date: 2011-06-24 02:34:01
Yes, thank you!
@_date: 2011-06-23 02:45:09
No, the government did not make its money back. Are you trolling? Seriously, look at the Tarp Update. 
For the banks, sometime in 2009 we gave out 245.1 billion. Today we have 252.52 billion back. So:
Future value: 252.52
Present value: 245.1
Months: 24
Calculated rate: 0.1243%
Please check my math (I could be doing this incorrectly).

The government would pay for people's bad mortgages.
@_date: 2011-06-22 23:21:59
Agreed. But what makes it okay for the bankers/insurance/automobile companies to be the primary recipients of bailout money? What difference does it make?
@_date: 2011-06-22 23:32:36
Why wouldn't the govt just give the homeowners a subsidized loan (which is essentially what the banks got)? Also, did you not look at the Daily Tarp Update I linked to? They have barely paid back their loans (does not take into account tax breaks), GM is way behind on payments, and you can forget about AIG. Why is that somehow more fair than subsidizing consumers directly through a low interest loan program? 
@_date: 2011-07-01 21:36:32
Aha! Thank you.
@_date: 2011-06-23 02:28:56
So what? Even if you just focus on the banks, they got an awesomely cheap bailout PLUS tax breaks in some cases. Getting a return at below market rates is not "making money." It is a bailout for bankers.
@_date: 2011-06-19 16:24:30
A stainless steel squirrel, perhaps?

Quick question: Is using the built-in encryption in bitcoin-qt (with a long password) considered sufficient for an internet-connected device?

I'm interested in what you mean by this. In my mind, theory and practice are two different things. In fact, it's noteworthy to me when they actually happen to converge.

I swear, didn't someone like Gavin have a escrow service back in the day?
@_date: 2013-03-11 01:17:40
Nope. I don't trust any of the online wallet systems. I have a wallet on my computer that i have encrypted (which is trivially easy; it's on the tool menu in bitcoin-qt). I also have a backup of my encrypted wallet in my email and another stashed in my home. Now, if you forget your password that you used to encrypt your wallet, then your f'ed.
@_date: 2013-03-11 02:53:10
Thanks for the heads up. I don't do many transactions. But when i do, I typically do a backup.

Bitcoin may also serve as a stock market in the future. Folks are working on bitcoin extensions which allow you to put a mark on certain coins. You could then trade those coins with other people as a stock. For example, I own a company, and I want to issue shares of stock. So, I make a mark on a bitcoin, divide that bitcoin into 1000 pieces and issue them as shares. The person who has a share can then receive bitcoins each month as dividend payments or whatever. They could also trade that share to someone else, and they would get the dividends. 
@_date: 2013-03-19 05:52:38
This does not mean "bitcoins are legal."

Agreed except I don't think the redditors' reactions to the non-believers is rooted in paranoia. It could be that some folks need to feel like they are being persecuted because suffering and persecution gives them a sense of validation.

Does your friend use linux or windows?
@_date: 2013-11-11 06:45:16
How about this:
1. Get old computer
2. Install debian 
3. Install bitcoin-qt
4. Encrypt your wallet using the normal bitcoin-qt encrytpion scheme
5. Create a canary wallet with a small number of coins in it. Use the canary wallet for normal transactions. If it gets robbed, you are out a few hundred bucks but you now know to reformat your machine. Keep your high-value wallet somewhere else on the machine (encrypted w/ gpg or whatever). 
6. Only use this machine for bitcoin-qt and nothing else
7. Keep the machine up-to-date.
@_date: 2013-12-02 08:00:19
Yup, paper wallets are vulnerable to being lost/burnt/stolen. Create a wallet on a fresh computer. Put a good passphrase on your wallet. Encrypt your wallet with GPG, and save it to several mediums.

Don't be paranoid, and don't spread paranoia. Paranoia takes too much energy, and it hinders your concentration on important work. Also, don't snitch-jacket or engage in witch hunts. They harm the person who is being accused, and they harm the accuser (because who wants to work with a person who snitch-jackets?).
Since you are doing something on the fringes of society, and since that thing will have an impact on other the lives of other people, you may from time to time be monitored or your groups may be infiltrated. It sucks, but once you accept that reality and learn to cope with it, you will gain the ability to move on and do awesome things.
@_date: 2013-11-08 04:57:19
This is rough to watch.

Does anyone care if bitcoin fails as a currency? I'm not going to spend time wringing my hands worrying about whether bitcoin effectively serves the monetary interests of a nation-state.
