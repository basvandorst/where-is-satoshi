Looks like the calm before another storm.  Either it hits 12,500 and go to 17k+ or it will go down to 7k.
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:03:47
You are way out of depth when you think dividends define intrinsic value.  Go get yourself a decent education.
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:52:49
Doubt so.  A better theory - top 1,000 BTC holders who own 35% got rich during the Nov/Dec spike to 20k and are now cashing out.  That explains the decline from 20k to today's 11k.  
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:51:45
Yeah, I'm here to steal your precious Dutch Tulips
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:40:14
Dow up, S&amp;P 500 up.  Great .... crypto crash doesn't impact the stock market.  This is really good news.  Damage is contained.

Dude, I wasn't the one who said that 6k is OK.

Hold if you can afford to lose.  Don't buy more if you can't afford it.  This can go either way - recover or drop further, either is equally possible.
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:09:23
It's not the one-day drop.  Fact is, BTC has been on the decline for month than a month and there's really no floor in sight.  Unlike other assets that have an intrinsic value (and hence a floor), BTC is worth basically close to $0.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:57:40
It is more likely due to the increased clampdown by the Chinese government and also, people are waking up to the fact that the price of BTC was manipulated and the bubble is about to burst.
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:30:48
Gasp!  Omg!  Then what's the intrinsic value of Bitcoin???  Surely the critics who said $0 can't be correct!!
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:54:08
It's so predictable.  There will be soon be news, this time from America, on tightening regulations and that will cause another 20% drop.
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:47:36
Try shredding that, fool.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:12:54
There is a difference between it's usefulness as a tech and the price bubble it's in.  Don't confuse the two.
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:59:12
You mean "it has not recovered from it's Nov/Dec ATH" is not real?  Or "each correction took it down 20%" is not real?
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:33:24
Ok, same page.
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:10:25
Yeap, looks like someone pulled the rug on all the cryptos at once.  If it's not a coincident, I must say the execution is immaculate.
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:51:58
Strange that many of you interpret a large sell order as a "wall" to manipulate price.  Ever occured to you that it's just someone dumping his load of BTCs?
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:41:49
It's going to break the $10k floor soon ...
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:12:32
Since it's past 12.5k, in theory it should go all the way up to 17k with 10k as support.  But that's just theory.
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:01:02
Will you buy at 20,000?  If not, why do you assume there will be another retard who will do that?
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:32:08
Guys, I think this is the beginning of the end.  As with most bubbles, it starts with a consistent decline (30% down since Dec) and then, .... the big plunge.  
I'm bailing out while I still made some profit.
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:41:07
No, not square one.  It will be Utopia.  Bitcoin will then fulfil the original intent of being a currency that is truly owned by the people and not the governments/banks, it will provide banking to the millions of unbanked, wipe out poverty, cure all disease, etc, etc.
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:09:04
I got blockchain enabled Tulips.  U interested?
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:37:39
It's across the board - that's the issue.
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:23:32
Just because he believes in short trades and you believe in holding?  BTC is a bubble, play it either way you want.  But if you want to hold, you run the risk of being the last person holding the bucket of shit when it crash.
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:42:54
Dude, top 1,000 controls 35% of BTC.  You are either ill informed or just spreading FUD.
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:34:34
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:54:03
$200 before 2013, $2,000 in mid 2017.
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:47:16
So said the Dutch Tulip traders before the crash.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:51:35

There is a good discussion already ongoing - 
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:55:16
Ok, you are a certified newbie (and a rather dumb one).  Most playing this game knows it's a bubble and doing quick trades to take advantage before it crashes.
Asset class?  Going strong?  Lmao!  Few people cared about BTC till the manipulated price spike.
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:59:46
You think BTC is some precious commodity that governments are interested in?  It has no value and if the US Government so choose to do, it can print as much USD as it wants to buy it up.  
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:10:56
Don't worry.  Bitfinex will soon print enough Tethers to bump up the price.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:05:12
Korea - "Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon said in an interview with local radio station TBS that banning trading in digital currencies was "a live option."
China - Nobody gives a fuck about mining.  China is outright making is illegal to trade - 
FUD?  Fuck you. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:56:55
You can always offer to pay the bank in BTC.  Tell them it will be worth $100k each soon.
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:09:05
Nah!  Like all good politicians in a democratic country, they will just sit on an unpopular decision.  And every now and then, say something negative ... just in case things goes south and they can say "I told you so" :)
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:41:50
Guys, stop holding and hoping for price drops to buy.  That's the wrong way to make money from BTC.  I.e. shooting for the moon.
The key is taking advantage of BTC's volatile nature.  There have been at least 5 rebounds of over 10% in last 7 days.  If you had bought/sold during those 5 rebounds, you would have made over 60% gain in just in 7 days.
You can write me off as a troll or FUD or whatever.  Or you can thank me later for the tip.
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:21:01
What audit?  Friedman made it extremely clear that this is NOT an audit and took great pains to distance themselves from any claim that Tether is backed by USD.  Learn to read English.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:17:20
The last spikes were in 2013 and 2017.  In between, BTC price was stable.  So if you think the current spike is due to natural market demand or earth shaking tech, then you are delusional.  As a tech, it's ancient and superceded by superior coins.
So, .. it's a bubble and like the Dutch Tulip, it will crash.  The only game worth playing now is short trades.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:18:46
Don't FUD - China did not bad trading previously.  They banned ICO and exchanges.  That is not the same thing a making trading completely illegal as that targets the entire chain.
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:16:02
Floor = Intrinsic Value = Close to $0
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:18:33
You got a better strategy?  I'm all ears (not being sarcastic).

Gosh ... your bank account is bigger?  Nice.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:33:53
14k to be precise.  So yeah, I'm rather annoyed
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:24:54
Top 0.005% controls 35% of all BTC.  This is an unregulated market where all sort of tactics such as pump &amp; dump, churning, wash trading are taking place.  FFS, of course it's manipulated.
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:26:26
More likely the other way round with China and Korea regulators cramping down.
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:23:56
So what's the general consensus of a good price?  $40,000 from $10,000 investment?  If that's the target, we already reached it.
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:46:36
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:46:02
Remove the noise and it's actually quite simple.  Print Tether, use Tether to buy BTC on an exchange they own (Bitfinex), cash out using BTC/USD.  When BTC goes down too much, print more Tether to buy BTC at increasingly higher price.  If other words, while you and I are pumping real cash into BTC, they are buying it with Tether to pump it up and then cashing out.
@_date: 2018-01-21 01:56:51
This is a good discussion on the Tether issue - 
If the Tether scam gets pulled, BTC will sink.  Invest with eyes open and don't just dismiss every bad news as FUD.
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:48:12
I don't buy all these claims that "it's a correction and the price will go up".  There is nothing to substantiate that.  Facts - (1) it has not recovered from it's Nov/Dec ATH and has been on the decline since then and (2) each "correction" took it down 20%.  
Next "correction" will either take down to $8,500 or much further down if panic sets in.
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:48:05
It's not just one troll.  Just do a google on "tether bitfinex scam".  Plenty of solid articles on this.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:51:21
Keep your money.
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:30:39
Yes but only if BTC functions as a currency (which it currency isn't).
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:26:28
Just a small problem - the spike to 20k was due to market manipulation using Tethers.  So it's now going to go down to it's original price - $1,000 or $100 (if the Mt Gox manipulation is factored in).
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:02:30
The BTC network itself is hard to hack.  But exchanges are not and that's where most of the hacking is done.  
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:28:29
I would like to think a rebound is almost certain.  So just set the sell order to +10% and alert you when it does.  If it makes you feel any better, I have plenty bought at a little above 14k.
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:49:16
This is hilarious - 
Trying to apply technical analysis to BTC is retarded.
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:09:49
The only people getting scammed are those putting cash into BTC thinking it's a good long term investment.
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:01:36
wtf do the banks got to do with BTC?
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:13:18
Actually, there are 3 camps - (a) those who don't think it's a bubble and BTC is undervalued (the HODLers), (b) those who know it's a bubble and doesn't participate and (c) those who know it's a bubble but nonetheless is willing to take the short term risks.  I belong to (c).
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:07:32
It is a Taiwanese company.  And I said they "print" Tethers "claiming" that it's backed by USD.  But they have refused to allow an independent auditor to verify this claim.
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:13:48
Top 100 wallets control 20% of market.  You need to control 2% of trading volume to influence the market and only 3%-10% of all BTCs are traded each day.  So yes, any one of the top 100 wallets can manipulate the whole market price.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:51:33
Long enough to know that the 10x price spike is manipulated and happy to play along and profit.
Dude, I have been in this game long enough to know you are just a newbie chanting the HODL mantra.  
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:19:48
Check the charts - 12 noon, all the major coins down almost simultaneously.  Anyone got a reasonable explanation for this?  Can't be coincidental.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:59:38
What are you talking about mate?  The volume is highest during the downslope and low volume during the upslope.  This is classic pump and dump.
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:33:35
Yes, you may be right .... $3k to $6k but little buyers so it's as good as $0.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:20:42
lol ... and your source is?  Anyway, believe in whatever fantasy you created.  The riot in China and Korea is real and the dumping is real.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:17:26
No.  China is exiting.  Chinese regulators are ruthless and efficient and Chinese traders are moving their money to safer havens.  Koreans are over leveraged and also exiting.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:11:36
Fuck you.  I'm sitting on 400k of paper loss.  But face the facts and stop dismissing everything negative as FUD or trolls.  It doesn't do the newbies here any favour as you will get them burnt.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:24:55
Other markets, maybe.  But don't you think BTC has somewhat settled on a rather predictable 11,000 - 15,000 oscillation?
My opinion is that the whales doing the pump/dump have settled on this window.
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:14:25
I would assume most people here know that and just profiting from it (like me).
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:58:11
Don't just hold unnecessarily.  Set for yourself a target price you will be happy with.  You don't want to be the idiot holding the shit pot when it crashes.
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:41:07
Yo, don't attack the messenger.  If you got any substance to refute, please do so.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:14:20
Your words, not mine.  I simply said China and Korea are exiting the market.  And at least I substantiated it with facts while you are relying on ...... a big mouth.
@_date: 2018-01-12 06:23:51
Selling now.  I'm happy with my 25% profit.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:52:16
Oh really?  Another nice FUD.  I bought at 14k+ and that's the paper loss I'm sitting on.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:38:07
Good for you.  But you really think the 7x spike is really going to happen again for these new traders?  Come on ....
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:25:13
Like all bubbles, it will crash and die eventually.  Better sooner than later so that there will be less casualties.  I'm not immune ... still got a pretty substantial holding bought at 14k+
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:58:55
Mt Gox engineered the price manipulation to $1,000 in 2013.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:40:19
Can't take bad news because it ruins your fantasy?  How about this - 10% of BTC was traded in last 24hours during the sellout.  This is 3 times the normal daily volume.
The dumping is REAL and there is no clear reason for any form of recovery.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:42:25
Tell that to the Dutch Tulip traders who didn't manage to get rid of their stocks.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:34:29
Plenty of alt coins that do that and do a far better job.

It's called Acceptance.  Congrats, my friend.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:42:59

@_date: 2018-01-16 17:33:51
Its pure carnage .... 20-30% drop across all major coins.  This is not BTC price manipulation but wholesale dumping of cryptos.   
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:41:18
Dude, you really are a retard if you think people here cares enough to read histories of anonymous people in reddit.  Go out more, make some friends and see the real world.
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:49:28
Because there are no other exchange issuing their own coins (Tethers) and claiming that it's backed 1-1 by USD.  That is the issue that needs to be audited.
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:00:42
China and Korea clampdowns.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:57:58
Omg ... this has nothing to do with tech.  China's problem is corruption and outflow of this money out of China.  If you have ever dealt with trying to wire money out of China, you will understand.
China is not trying to destroy the market (it doesn't care).  But it wants to close off the leaks and therefore it making it completely illegal.
Again, I don't want to sound condescending but you understanding very little about China and are way out of depth.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:01:58
A better read of the history is the spike in Nov/Dec is one-off (discounting the Mt Gox engineered spike in 2013) and the follow-up decline of close to 50% has NO precedent.  
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:57:50
So who's the dumb fuck who will challenge anyone to define intrinsic value?  It's finance 101 so you are looking rather retarded.
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:46:40
Put in a sell order at your purchase price + 10%.  Then go to bed.

BTC was never ready for futures and institutional investors.  The market is too small and easily manipulated with their funding.  Futures gave them the perfect weapon to clean up the market - Shorting.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:04:18
Nothing rare about BTC.  1,000+ alt coins out there that does a better job.
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:56:03
There were only 2 spikes in the long history of BTC - 2013 and 2017.  Both are believed to be due to price manipulation.  In fact, most people here didn't even hear about BTC till the 2017 publicity.  "Limited supply" has no bearing due to alt coins.  "Usefulness" is a joke as BTC has ceased to be used as a currency.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:47:55
Believe in whatever fantasy you want.  If the crackdown is not real, there won't be a petition with 200,000 petitions.  And Koreans who are heavily vested and don't want to lose their money are dumping as fast as they can.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:55:01
Facts are facts.  Keep deluding yourself by declaring everything you don't want to hear as FUD.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:36:32
Shit, don't wish for that.  If the Asians pull away, BTC price will crash through the floor.  It's sub 10K now because of the cash inflows.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:26:18
Those so called veterans who claim that this is 'normal' and belittling you are full of shit.  This is NOT normal with China and Korea exiting the market and huge outflow of liquidity.
I'm fully convinced that the Nov/Dec spike was due to price manipulation and will not repeat with all the heavy scrutiny and regulatory bodies stepping in.  In other words, there is no more new ATH and BTC will either go into slow or fast decline.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:48:56
You are the retard.  The resignation demand was for the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Finance was pro-crypto.  Now, the Ministry of Finance (which has ultimate say on this matter) has reversed course and put banning on the table.  Get your facts right and stop muddling the water with FUD.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:08:42
Don't know, hope not.  If no panic selling, price has to correct to take into consideration China's and Korea's exit.  How much correction is anyone's guess.
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:55:10
Systematic dumping of BTCs for real cash.  The party is almost over and the smarter ones are leaving first in an orderly manner.
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:09:44
Of course.  But I'm not sure if they are still doing it.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:48:22
Enough.  You know nothing about China and it's not FUD.  Chinese government goes to extremes and they are now cracking down on everything that is even remotely associated with cryptos.  
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:29:07
Still do not believe?  How about this? 
"For this reason Tether does not operate in countries and U.S. states that do not regulate virtual currencies. Users will not be able to access the Tether services from these locations and Tether will not be able to offer services to Residents of these locations".
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:08:26
I don't hear anyone here saying they will buy up the price so why should there be an upturn?  Unlike stocks during a good company earning report, there is nothing to substantiate a price increase.

Omg .... you are looking dumber by the sentence.  Intrinsic value is INDEPENDENT of market value.  The market price of gold is whatever the market is willing to pay.  Take that away and what is left is intrinsic value, which is likely much lower.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:50:37

Bitfinex printed over $700m in Tether from thin air to prop up BTC price.  So you decide if this is manipulated or not.
Yes, in case you not aware Bitfinex = Tether 
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:14:30
You are the real FUD.  There is nothing to substantiate your claim.  The reality is that China and Korea are exiting and causing the crash which we may never recover.  These are FACTs, deal with it.

On hindsight, yes.  But it's a lot higher risk.

@_date: 2018-01-13 15:07:16
What you asked is essentially - "what happens when the bubble burst"?  This is what will happen - nobody wants to buy, sellers start lowering price, panic sets in, number of sellers increase further accelerating price drop and finally ... boom.
Yes, you asked a very good question - why do people always expect there to be a buyer?
@_date: 2018-01-21 05:59:12
If you are going to put money into anything, a bit of reading will help.  Closing your eyes and dismissing everything you don't want to hear as FUD is a clear sign of a delusional speculator.

I doubt if it a blow up and crash will happen by itself.  What it takes is for a real, high publicity investigation.  That will snowball into loss of confidence of entire crypto market and the resulting investor sell-off.
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:53:06
Good article, worth a read.
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:21:20
What you described is market value, not intrinsic value.
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:34:07
The numbers are getting too big, BTC is flowing into mainstream so my bet is that a high publicity investigation is round the corner.  This is actually good for BTC (before any of you yell FUD).
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:24:02
Wrong.  It was $814m in Tethers.  And that is precisely the manipulation that resulted in the Nov/Dec ATH.
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:12:31
Those who paid more than 6K are so screwed.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:04:56
lol ... stop agitating the poor guy!
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:21:37
That is FUD.  At no time in the history of BTC has it hit an absurd high of 10x of it's value within a short period of 6 months, crashed to half the value and magically recovered to original peak.
This is the same BS that keeps repeating itself - "we been here before xxx times".
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:33:53
Dude, when you 12:1 margin trading, it gives you all the leverage you need.  $200B sounds like a lot but daily trade volume is just 3%.  The only reason why this doesn't happen in stock market is tight regulations.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:31:43
Wrong.  Drop to $1 and remains at $1.  Then everyone will start using it.
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:42:36
And 20K less than 2 months ago and never recovered.  But of course, no one here wants to hear the bad news so it's all FUD.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:34:49
Dude, it's not a BTC issue.  It's across all cryptos.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:53:15
Stop spreading FUD with old news.
This is today - 
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:24:35
Nope.  It got to 20k because of the Tether scam.  But do feel free to take advantage of it.  We are all happy co-conspirators.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:21:06
60% in 7 days is too little return?  wow ....
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:53:46
Yeah, ... pour in some real cash to save the hodlers from losing their pants!
@_date: 2018-01-21 09:57:03
lol ... honestly, yes.  current batch is paper loss at 14k.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:54:17
Started ..... second time it's gone into 10k territory.  Next 12 hours we might get a sense of the real floor.
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:03:38
Hey retard, if the assumptions made in the news is true, the price should go UP, not DOWN.
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:32:27
Well, I think you are a liar bullshitting about the truckloads of money you made.  Why?  You are so desperate to hold on to that meagre paper gain (or loss) that you go ape shit over any suggestion that holding is not a good idea. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:48:22
China and Korea heavy trading period starting soon.  Be prepared to see more heavy dumping and price declines.
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:50:25
Some one else will take up the slack, no big deal.  Only difference is that electricity is the predominant cost factor in mining and that's cheap in China.  Real impact - zero to BTC price (since it's speculative) but possibly higher transaction cost in future.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:22:00
NEO!!!  It's the only one in green :)
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:44:29
The window is between 11,000 to 15,000.  If you had bought at 12,000, just stay cool and put in the sell order for 13,200.  Then wait till the next dip to a level you are comfortable (probably 11,000 to 12,000) and just repeat the process.
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:16:09
First they claim that Tether is = USD then refuse outright to honour any redemption.  In meantime, they continue to pump massive ($700m in last week) amounts of Tether and used it to buy BTC and other cryptos.  So you decide if this is legit.
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:07:59
It's not a nightmare as it's good for the future of BTC.  It has to drop to a level which is stable and then it will be useful as a currency (which has always been the intent).
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:08:31
Why negative?  Someone else is doing the illegal work of pumping up the BTC for all of us.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:24:10
More precisely - to take full advantage of the bubble.
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:15:41
If your fantasy makes you feel any better ... yes, sure.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:08:11
The beauty/horror of BTC exchanges - 24x7.  Non-stop ecstasy when it's climbing, non-stop grieve when it's dropping.  Damn, no "market closed" for breathing space ....
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:11:04
Err .... I don't think most of the people here care that much about LN at this time
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:19:46
ffs, it will oscillate back to above that.
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:07:47
No, there isn't one.  And it's just as likely to go down or up.  Anyone telling you differently is BS.
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:27:20
it's 12500 that it needs to break.
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:58:15
Because there's a limited number of suckers to buy it Up.  That's why any negative news is so repugnant and people here go ape shit and call it FUD.  They are just afraid of being the last sucker holding the shit can. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:01:45
"There are great concerns regarding virtual currencies and the justice ministry is basically preparing a bill to ban cryptocurrency trading through exchanges," said Justice Minister Park Sang-ki.
Nothing ambiguous and definitely nothing about unregulated or not.
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:18:29
Go read the wiki.  It's written in a simple language for layman like you.
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:42:06
More likely a dump if it doesn't hit 12,500
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:52:27
Sorry, ... speculators like these get zero sympathy.  They deserve it.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:49:34
Stop making statements that you can't substantiate.  This is really irresponsible.
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:16:13
Nobody said anything about balance sheet.  Yes, I believe it's IP is mainly in it's tech IP.  As for BTC, the tech is not unique and has been replicated in hundreds (or thousand+) of alt coins.  It's only intrinsic value is therefore in it's implementation as a currency, of which it has failed due to price instability and high transaction cost.  So yes, it's intrinsic value is close to $0.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:42:33
Not if the reason is permanent.  The China/Korea crackdowns are permanent and will be baked into the price.  The current price range then becomes the new norm.
@_date: 2018-01-21 09:56:12
Wash trading through the crypto pairs.
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:18:02
So any opinion other than hitting the moon is FUD to you?  
Cool.  BTC value is $0.  Anything more is pure speculation.  I.e. speculating on the possibility that you will find a bigger idiot who will pay more than what you paid.
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:17:38
Please stop trying to sound intelligent.  You doing a really poor job.
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:44:41
That means losing another $3,000 along the way before possibly a nose dive.
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:00:13
No clear date or even clear direction has been communicated.
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:39:51
You are preaching to a bunch of retards who thinks HODL is a grand strategy, goes ape shit with any negative news that might burst the bubble and calls it FUD.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:22:08
Dude, i have vested interest to see the price go up.  But don't get delusional by thinking this is not a bubble.
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:06:04
Let's face it - BTC is hanging by a thread.  The only noise here is (a) HODL or (b) buy the dip.  I don't hear anyone saying "20k or 18k is a bargain".  So ... no one here to bring up the price and just hoping that someone else will do that.  There is absolutely no reason for another ATH.  On the other hand, every time there is a bad news, BTC crumbles.  And there are plenty of potential bad news coming up such as G20 agreement on coordinated clampdown or the Tether scam being investigated.  
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:33:55
You first need to be honest to yourself and ask 'how much am I willing to pay'?  Price of BTC has nothing to do with anything other than speculating on what the price that the next person will pay for it.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:17:52
A lot of you guys were celebrating when the futures market opened.  Remember the phase ... "BTC going up with institutional money flowing in!"?
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:57:41
No, it's not.  See that high volume drop starting at 13k?  That's the knee jerk reaction from news on China and Korea regulators cramping down.  It's now 1am and more dumping from these countries will start again in a couple of hours.  Just hang tight.
@_date: 2018-01-18 00:06:08
Stop whining.  When BTC hit ATH, nobody was crying for regulations.  You think the Nov/Dec spike to 20k was due to natural demand and not price manipulation?  Gullible. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:37:17
Interesting .... ETH overtook BTC as the most traded coin in last 24 hours.
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:21:58
Guys, please understand basic business.  Audit is performed by certified accountants who put themselves in an unlimited liability situation for the validity of their reports.  There was never an audit published to-date.

Why did you wait 3 months?  You could have at least tripled your money buying/selling on the rebounds.  See my other post.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:49:10
Fuck you.  I bought at 14k so I'm pretty pissed at the moment.  But no impact to stock is good ... don't want to see the other window showing red.
