Interesting. By comparison, the Universe is estimated to be 13.8×10^9 years old, so it would take 6×10^24 universe lifetimes at 1000000 tr/s. A problem for my great^115 grandchildren to solve.

They are apparently testing to link gmail addresses to Google wallets -which are linked to a credit card or bank account- , so that you can send money to other accounts like this.
What does that mean for bitcoin growth? The bitcoin protocol is a lot more than just a competitor of Western Union, sure, but transfering money over national boundaries is still one of its most evident case usages.

This announcement only concerns the bitcoin-qt client, updates on the other wallets are independent to this one

Funny how they show people withdrawing euros from the machine, when it does NOT do that. Damn journalists.

A downtrend of the network hash rate will not mean the end of the currency; in fact it already happened before [(see end of 2011)]( Yes, it will decrease the cost of a 51% attack, but even losing 30% of the current hash rate would only put us at the [levels of 3 or 4 months ago]( So I would not be particularly concerned with this.

Thank you for clarifying this! I am glad that you considered my opinion despite all the downvotes I'm getting.

Well, I think for instance starting the piece with a sentence explaining that this is the announcement you would have liked to see but that never was, which would be a lot more clear. It currently begins with "By the Bitcoin Core Developers (a complete list of signers can be found below)", which is just false information (since you wrote it), and which makes the whole writeup misleading.

I encourage everybody to read Mike's blog post, which explains the current situation pretty well. 
But I do not agree with his decision to quit now, when people like him are needed the most. 
I hope a viable alternative to the 1Mb blocks is in place when in a few months we hit the limit so that miners have something better to flock to.

Edit: This blog piece used to start with "By the Bitcoin Core Developers (a complete list of signers can be found below)", which was potentially misleading the readers. The author below took my suggestion and added a clarifying first sentence, so that it is now more clear that this is indeed not an official open letter from the core developers. I am leaving the brief discussion below for transparency:
This piece is very misleading. This is NOT an official open letter from the core developers, which are still NOT proposing a 2MB direct block size increase. However, anybody reading this might get this impression. Note the lack of signatures at the bottom (and the title of the blog post).
To me this looks just like a move to add more confusion to the debate.

I think you are missing a key part in all this, the focused DDoS attacks on one or the other branches of the fork

You also have to factor the electricity and bandwith cost, which can be non trivial.

Deletion might be on a timer, you'd probably be better of by just copying all the encrypted data to a new drive.

In the end a chargeback is still possible with bitcoin, you just needs a third party that is willing to eat the risk in exchange for a fee, much like an insurance company. When the need arises this kind of service will surface as well.

Thanks a lot, I was unaware this was possible.

OP should probably also add an additional point:
3.5 Print the webpage with the QR and public an private keys, and/or save the webpage and store it somewhere: you might need to provide this information to unlink the authenticator in case of a lost or damaged smartphone.

The last of the 21M BTC will only be mined around 2140 iirc, so it is not a scenario worth considering for us now since chances are we will all be dead by then. To put things in scale, the next block reward halving is going to happen in 2017, meaning BTC supply is to remain at a constant 25BTCs/block until then, and bitcoin is going to succeed or fail probably before that mark is reached. 
It's interesting to speculate about the endgame, I agree, but for practical purposes, if BTC succeeds and we go to 50000$ per coin, there will be plenty of incentives to keep mining and creating new mining pools even after the next reward halving in 2017. Alternatively if BTC fails and price falls to zero, then nobody will care.

You can still remove the authenticator and add a second one. I did this myself when I found out I should have stored the keys but hadn't. 
To do it, you need to enter to your MtGox account (with the current authenticator code), go to the security page, and click on the red cross to the right of the Software Authenticator. The page will ask your for 5 auth codes in a row, so be patient and impute them all. Once this is done, the authenticator will be removed from your account.
Now you can add a new authenticator, and this time make sure you store the public/private keys and the QR somewhere you can recover.

These authenticators work by generating a number that is in sync with the server in question (in this case MtGox), specific for your account. This code changes every ~30 seconds, so you can not write it down. The idea is that each time you log in it will ask you for the code, so you have to launch the authenticator app from your phone, get a number, and impute it before it expires. If an attacker were to successfully guess you username and password, they would have to steal your phone to be able to enter your account.
If you loose your phone I guess you'd have to try to access/remove the authenticator from google play/your google account. If anyone has more info on this please chip in.

Just in case: the OP was not mining anything. He was just installing bitcoin-qt in a new computer, which is a local bitcoin wallet that needs to download the full blockchain in order to work. This is generally a pain in the ass and takes ages, and he claims due to SSD it was orders of magnitude faster than in a regular HDD.
If you want to solve blocks (ie. mining) within minutes, you better look into asics rather than asking about GPUs, since GPU mining is largely not profitable anymore and you need specialized hardware to make a good return of investment.
