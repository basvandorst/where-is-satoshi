Libertymark, I think your argumentation is sound.
I will be pulling out my btc, thanks for giving me the final push.

I just clicked the link and it said it sent me.
I'm so excited!

I don't see any ads, is that because im using adblock plus?

So many websites, so much mbtc to collect x__x
Originally I just wanted a test transaction and send back the double as suprise gift for showing good faith in me(as long as it isn't too much, like 30 euro).
But I guess this will work too, thanks for showing me these faucets. 
What I meant with scams is that I don't trust sites quickly that say ''free money'' you know. Nothing is free in this world.

I remember last time I tried something like this and got scammed. Sadly I'm sometimes a bit naive to the evil that lurks out there.
Is this really trustworthy?

I did notice though, your rewards are like 4x mine. I guess there is some sort of ''reward'' system implemented?

I'm sorry, this is very new and exciting to me. Could you please explain or link me to a so-called faucet?

Yeah it makes sense.
As a ''techie'' myself, I spent all my money on 5december, thinking it will raise. 
I still believe in the system, which is why I invested in it. But I won't be able to buy any food or pay the rent this month.
Sucks for me :/
So do you think it will go 1300+ anytime soon?

Wow giraffe! +1 for you!
It IS WORKING! I just got my first 1 euro from someone I don't know.
But one thing I Don't understand though, what is their modus operandi, their business model? I don't understand how they can give money away like that.
I'm not noted down on some nazi watchlist or something now, am I?
