I don't think I ever argued that all morality is the same. Indeed, there are varying moralities, many of which overlap and many of which disagree.
I'm merely pointing out that the source of morality in humans is at the biological level, and not the result of a deity. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 15:02:30


Morality is the result of evolution/natural selection. Treating each other well, and cooperating, are traits that have furthered the human species above others. If everyone thought it was okay to steal and murder we would never have gotten far enough to even develop written language. No deity is needed to explain this. 


Spoilers: it wasn't. 


And there's the circular logic. "This book is proof because this book says so!" 
Personally I'm a follower of the [Napkin religion]( 
@_date: 2016-08-12 14:41:53


Morality can be ascertained based on the amount of suffering it causes. Sam Harris' [The Moral Landscape]( goes more in-depth into this. 
The fact that you're justifying genocide, murder, and eternal torture is pretty sad.


As opposed to your justification, a 3,000 year old book? 
Okey dokey. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 12:42:04
This is really awesome. You're a great uncle! 
@_date: 2016-08-12 15:37:16


Evolution. It's literally the driving force behind all animal characteristics. There doesn't need to be a reason behind it.
Other species evolved different traits. Morality is merely one many mammals selected. It's a simple concept.


You cannot say absolutely that rape is wrong, because guess what? *Your own text allows it*. Rape victims are forced to marry their rapists (Deut 22:28-29). Rape victims who are already married are put to death for not crying out for help (Deut 22:23-24). Women are treated purely as property, and your God repeatedly tells his people to take them as the spoils of war if they are virgins (Judges 5:30, Deut 21:10-14, Zechariah 14:1-2).
Thankfully, humans have morals outside of that. 


The entirety of history proves this assertion incorrect. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 14:17:46


Which part of God's morals are absolute? How it's fine to stone someone to death for working on the sabbath, [even if he's just gathering sticks to build a fire]( Or how about how it's okay to [wipe out other tribes and take their women (virgins only!)]( if they are non-believers? 
What about the actions of God himself, such as the blatant genocide of the flood story? Or the simple idea that anyone who doesn't accept Jesus is sent to burn forever? Or how about when God sends [two bears to slaughter 42 boys]( merely because they made fun of a Elisha?
None of these morals are absolute, and *thank fucking goodness for that.*
@_date: 2016-08-12 13:20:19


Those two things aren't mutually exclusive. I'm an atheist but have a healthy respect an awe for the massive size and scale of the universe we live in. 
That fills me with a greater sense of wonder than the idea of an angry, spiteful deity.

Ehh, we're getting down a rabbit hole I'm not particularly interested in arguing. If someone wants to argue that logic/evidence/the scientific method all require the same amount of faith as religion, then there's not much I'm going to do to dissuade them. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 18:11:55


Again, I've never claimed there was one. Are you sure you're arguing with the right person? 


I'm not discussing any of that, actually. Again, are you replying to the right person here?


As I mentioned above, check out Sam Harris' book *The Moral Landscape* for a great discussion on the biological development of morality. He has a lot of fantastic sources in there too. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 18:23:08


Not quite. I accept the *logic* that Sam Harris has put forth, based on his argument and dearth of sourced evidence. I don't just blindly believe what he says. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 12:41:51
Shit man, I'm an atheist but I think you're being a bit harsh. The only God stuff is the design of the bank itself. It's not like it's covered in scripture.

Morals exist outside of religion, and indeed *pre-date* religion.

I believe in things based on logic and evidence, and will happily change my beliefs if that evidence also shifts. Catholics believe that a cracker and some wine are the *literal blood and body of a man dead for 2000 years*, because an old book and a man in a funny hat say so.
It's incredibly disingenuous to equate the two. 
**EDIT**: maybe I misunderstood what you were saying; I thought you were comparing my beliefs to Catholic communion, but on a second read I'm not sure that's what you were doing. Apologies, if so!

I would love to use one of these but a 6-8% conversion fee every time I put money on the card seems insane. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 12:13:00
Please keep me posted, curious to see how they classify that.
My biggest concern is that I pay no interest for the first 18 months on my card... but if I miss a minimum payment, *or use any cash-advance service*, the interest rate automatically jumps up to the maximum. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 21:40:21
Oh yeah, I'm sure they do. I just like how it's consistent volume (bots behaving normally), then a fuckload of volume, followed by no volume. I pictured a bot programmer going "Oh fuck" and quickly shutting his off.

**UPDATE**: received the following message from Chase:


to bill as a Quasi Cash Merchant. This does mean cash 
advance fees would be charged if the merchant bills your 
credit card. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 13:38:21
Does anyone know if Chase's credit card charges a cash advance fee? I know some do, but not all. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 12:11:44
I guess the bigger concern is the way they calculate their interest. For example, there's no interest on my Chase card for the first 18 months. HOWEVER, this changes if I miss a minimum payment, or use any cash-advance service: in that event the APR goes straight to the maximum. 
So although I don't care much about fees, the interest rate concerns me. 
@_date: 2016-03-30 13:16:30
I mean, both can be right. Markets (*any* market, not just Bitcoin) react illogically at times, and investment firms' goal is to find when things are undervalued or overvalued.

I did the same thing with a pi, but attached it to a full computer monitor and put it behind a one-way mirror to make a smart mirror.
Now instead of relying on me to give her updates, my wife keeps up with the Bitcoin price every morning when she checks her commute time and the weather. 
**EDIT**: since lots of people are asking, here's the gist of the mirror:
I took apart an old monitor from its casing and strapped it to a Raspberry Pi running Raspbian with the Magic Mirror software. Tweaked a bunch of the python script to scrape CSS feeds for live traffic, weather, Bitcoin, and news data. To make the mirror I bought a cheap shadow box from Michaels ($30 on sale) and put one-way mirror film over it, and installed the monitor and Pi on the other side. Then attached some mounting brackets to put it on the wall. 
There's a great forum [here]( with lots of info on doing it yourself! Overall it took me maybe 15-20 hours of work, and most of that was learning enough Python to be dangerous.
@_date: 2017-08-11 13:20:17

In September 2016 [he said]( "I expect Bitcoin to hit the $2000 mark within 2 years."
In December 2016, after Bitcache was funded, he revised this [and said]( Bitcoin would reach $2000 in 2017. 
It was already on the rise at that point though, so it's not much more than a shot in the dark that ended up being right. He's deleted plenty of other predictions that never came true, especially during the "down years" between 2013-2016. So now his history looks like he suddenly started pumping Bitcoin in 2016 and ended up right.
I don't have an axe to grind with Kim Dotcom, but these sort of retroactive "See I was right!" predictions are silly.

Divorce lawyers are really, *really* fucking good at finding evidence of assets. Because that's the key here: **they don't need to find your Bitcoin addresses themselves, just proof that you *have* Bitcoin that you're hiding.** Congratulations, you've now committed perjury on your affidavit (punishable by up to five years in prison), and the judge is going to award everything to your wife while her lawyer's accountants monitor all your financial transactions for the rest of your life, waiting for you to use your stash.

This is bad, illegal advice.

I'm hoping their plot revolves around using their university's VMs to mine Bitcoin, and the hyjinx that ensue from that.

Paying off student loans is a fantastic investment because the interest rates are usually pretty high (4-8%, depending on the loan). Not to mention student loans can sometimes be packaged off and sold to new holders, who can increase the rates depending on your income level. 
Car loans, meanwhile, are usually 1% or lower. Not nearly as much bang for your buck.
But regardless, paying off debt is a good feeling. Congrats!

(**DISCLAIMER**: this advice applies only to the United States)
When a couple files for a contested divorce, they're required to sign a financial affidavit. Lying on this affidavit, or trying to hide assets, is illegal under the penalty of perjury.
Feel free to try to hide your assets all you want, but your statement "There is no way for a lawyer or wife to find your stash!" is insanely naive advice.

If the money made them fight and get lawyers, then they were never happy to begin with.

Next surge? Buddy, let's finish enjoying our current surge first!

Yep, the tag is only a week old. When we moved last year, we took the old tag off and put the bottle in a wine storage box. It sat there for the past year gathering dust in the closet, and when the price hit $8,000 last week we remembered it and pulled it back out. That's when we made a new tag for it. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:24:18
This is a stupid mindset.
"Hey guys I bought this car last year with $100,000. Unfortunately, I could have invested that in stocks and it would now be worth $400,000!"

Compared to banks... I mean yeah, they are.

This is what people keep missing. Coinbase is bound by really stupid US anti-gambling laws. I've had personal bank accounts flagged for suspicious use because of the exact same thing before.
Don't blame Coinbase. Blame the US regulations.

Considering the cost will probably be different next year, saying "5+" is probably more accurate.

Warrant Canaries won't get you in contempt of court because it's a passive action (not updating a website), as opposed to a proactive action (taking the initiative to email people).

A friendly wager between two people, from what I understand, is not against the archaic US anti-gambling laws. Celebrities make famous, public wagers all the time over stuff. 
Organized gambling, however, is a different beast. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 13:22:19
Quit dreaming. *$682* is the only realistic expectation.
@_date: 2016-02-17 00:11:58


Personal wagers between individuals aren't against US law. Celebrities make huge, public wagers all the time. Organized gambling is what US laws target as illegal.
Plus, the Coinbase CEO's wager is for charity. This isn't remotely comparable.

Well yeah, most retailer stocks have been aching the last 3 months (which is when Overstock began to dip). Their great earnings in spite of the market is a great sign.

They're really, really not. That's sort of like saying Hitler and Stalin are the same because they both have mustaches.

We've known the answer to this for centuries.

Yeah it's not a perfect analogy, I agree. But it's just an analogy, and we shouldn't get too caught up in the analogy itself instead of the overall message he's making.

Your tax advice is bad and you should feel bad.

I mean, would you really expect them to completely reverse a large transaction like that? Taking profits is a taxable event--it's not a simply think to erase.

This is what the article says:


Bitcoin searches are almost certainly a trailing correlation with price movement, which is intuitive and doesn't really warrant a study or clickbait headline.

You're really nitpicking what is supposed to be an easy-to-understand analogy.

I've been 100% civil up until this point. I've posted nothing rude or hostile toward him, calmly stating that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.
But him turning tail when the con doesn't work, and then spinning it as him being the victim?
Fuck no. Civility is now gone.

You can spare me your "warnings", because I don't use Coinbase personally. I'm merely arguing that its number of users is absolutely relevant to the discussion of Bitcoin, and it's ridiculous to argue otherwise. 
@_date: 2016-05-20 18:44:13


Exactly this. The "bank error in your favor" shit doesn't work in real life. Knowingly keeping money that was given to you as a mistake is illegal (at least, in the US).
Now, the other person would still have to prove you knowingly kept it, and tie your identity to the BTC address, but still.

Coinbase is probably the easiest/most mainstream way for ordinary people to acquire Bitcoin. The number of users is absolutely relevant to Bitcoin, whether you like them specifically or not.

It's the typo where you say "on" instead of "one".
