why don't you link to a survey where we can click:
- cashout did actually earn us more money than we invested
- cashout would earn us more money than we invested if we cashed out now
- cashout would earn us less than invested
- got zhou tonged
- I'm a faggot who uses windows and who doesn't use NoScript so satoshi's ghost appeared and smashed my computer to pieces and told me to never touch his currency again

I predict that trolls and small-minded privileged middle-class children watching sensationalist youtube videos will post shit on reddit.

people considering themselves anarchists are usually rather left-wing while most libertarians are fascists and social darwinists who haven't made it out of the closet yet.
other than that, there's no difference between the two.
source: the stuff anarchists and libertarians post on reddit and other social media.
just look at how the latter love conspiracy theories that glorify the nazis or nikola tesla.

fun fact: egyptians also thought that people had to be useful in order to be allowed to live.
so after their agriculture became so efficient that there was more food than anyone could possibly eat it resulted in huge unemployment.
to prevent revolution, they had to feed the people who didn't own their own land but because they were retards they didn't want the unemployed to just sit at home where they could think and paint and write and invent because "that's not real work".
so they decided to let all unemployed people work on useless projects to make sure that they were doing work.
and that's how the pyramids were built.
and that's why there wasn't any progress at all for thousands of years. and that's why it is important to remember that "doing work" is not the same as "being useful". and that's why basic income is what we need now.

all the libertarians are downvoting you because their dream is a world without tax where they can let anyone starve who doesn't earn enough :p
fun fact: 100 acre farms only require two workers nowadays.

I mean, I'm a nerd who doesn't get along with most mainstream people but seeing how people here react to jokes makes me feel like I'm a normal person surrounded by a bunch of autistic asspies with down syndrome.

Nice writeup but the story isn't over yet.
As far as we know, Dragos could be pulling all of this out of his ass as part of some publicity stunt.
Let's wait for evidence before lynching obama, ok?

I don't trust them either but holy shit dude, are you retarded?
- the triangle is upside down
- "unsystem"
- cyberpunk/anarchist references and style everywhere
The illuminati reference is clearly a mockery of the current system, a joke, a humorous meme.
why is it that 99.99% in this subreddit are so far away from society that they don't get a joke when it's basically shoved up their arse?
holy shit, communication on this subreddit is like talking to a bunch of machines with literally zero phantasy, zero imagination, zero humor and zero ability to communicate.
did you not read any comics or books when you were young?

you take a lap.
(wtf does that even mean? it sounds like some shitty comeback that was trending in the 80s...)
I edited my post to be more retard-friendly. Is there still something you disagree with? Then shut up or post a source or reasoning of your own instead of outdated insults, thou misbegotten doghearted fustilarian.
