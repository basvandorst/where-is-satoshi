Let's see...
Activation period  block range (8064 blocks) | 1177344 - 1185408
-- | --
Current block height | 1183931
Blocks mined since period start | 6587 (81.68%)
Blocks left until period end | 1477 (18.32%)
Blocks last 24h | 587
1477 blocks left / 587 blocks / day = in 2.52 days current period ends
Current period duration 13.76 days
So next period should be from 15-April until 29-April (est.)

Nice service! How did you promote it to reach that level of usage? SEO, Ads, Friends, ..? Cool if you can provide a little bit of history and insights that other entrepreneurs can learn from :)

You should post this as a new thread, if Litecoin is relevant because of SegWit, I don't see why shouldn't this be.
