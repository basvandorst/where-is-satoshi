Don't do it. Bitcoins aren't real, they're just numbers.

There is a huge anticipation of a supply of inexpensive asic hardware, yes. Vapor so far.

Money isn't real, it's a faith-based form of psychological control. Gold has no intrinsic value, as it cannot be eaten or forinicated with.

If all you want to earn is pennies when the reward halves, then yeah it's worth it. Honestly, why not dump the money into an SC?

No, they archived [blockexplorer.com]( and used the data between block 0 and 180,000. I'm guessing you didn't RTFP.

You keep using the M word. Cows are my preferred trade good. Or underage midgets. Not much eating with midgets. But damn tasty.

Dude, parsing formatted HTML is way easier.

But the reward will go down before the release of BFL's ASICs, or there will be a negligible amount of time before the drop. Then you have to deal with the massive difficulty increase after the ASICs are released. And that doesn't even take into consideration how the exchanges might react, positively or negatively.

And it's 10x the earnings for an SC, at 10x the cost, payoff in the same amount of time.

It's supposed to happen this year. The reward halving occurs once a certain number of blocks is reached, don't remember the number. But another halving shouldn't happen for around 1-2 more years.
The issues I have comes down to the difficulty and price adjustments that are bound to follow ASICs hitting the market. If you do the calculations, the companies developing ASIC equipment plan to sell enough equipment to increase the hashing capability over 10x the current capacity. This means immediately some people will be able to make a killing, while others wait for their equipment. This effect will put GPU miners out of commission almost immediately, because with the increase of hashing comes an increase in difficulty. 
Then there's the price/btc. Back when I gave GPU mining a try I watched as the price/btc went from $10 to $5 while I waited for my replacement motherboard. Then I quit, expecting BTC to go away. However since the price has jumped back up again, I'm concerned that it's another bubble surrounding the release of ASIC hardware. So I'm expecting the price of BTC to drop to the $5 realm again.

There actually isn't any direct evidence that major banks are working with the NSA. Most of them are working with their ISPs to mitigate ongoing DDoS attacks. Some may have called the FBI.
