When you set your position on a margin trade you agree to a liquidation price which you know at that point.
The thing is even if you are right in the long term, BTC price swings in the short term can get you to the liquidation price and the margin call gets triggered.
Always remember “the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent”...applies for both long and short positions.
TL;DR Don’t trade BTC on margin if you don’t know what you are doing
