Same, they throw around security terms for the sake of throwing them around even when it fits the context poorly. 
It seems like the show tries to confuse people into thinking they're getting a realistic account of the black hat world.

There's a ton of recreational drug users who aren't defined by their drugs, and use them responsibly. This war is very expensive both for law enforcement and corrections and really just doesn't make sense.

Link to the USMS transaction?

It confuses me why Americans aren't making a bigger deal about the war on drugs. I couldn't care less about syrian refugees or who has to pay 5% more taxes, I wish a major candidate would platform on this.

The govt is going to actively try to devalue btc due to its inability to regulate it. It will not attack gold with the same determination.

The govt holding BTC is the govt betting against itself.

They have massive customer support issues.  None of my tickets have been answered in a reasonable time.

Look into MTurk

Its important to note it would probably not be in their best interest to perform such an attack. It would be quickly noticed and crash the value of BTC meaning less money and exodus for colluders. 
We should still make sure miners are better distributed, but I think the risk of collusion is low.

I run similar scans from my home ISP, if they inquire say you have a virus and that it's gone now

It's probably worth just remembering an electrum recovery key for that amount

Browser crypto has its risks and you should only use that site for demonstration/small coins

There's plenty of trustable mixing services?
@_date: 2016-07-26 04:12:13
Referring to services like Bitmixer. There's not much incentive for BM to go bad and there isn't much risk using it in incremental amounts.

Again, use Coinbase as an EXCHANGE NOT A WALLET it's very unbitcoin to trust value into any centralized party 
@_date: 2016-07-24 19:13:57
All the large onionland markets use Bitcoin exclusively now.
