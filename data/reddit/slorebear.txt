no, because it has 0 characteristics of what defines a ponzi scheme.  nobody made payouts using other investor's money, nobody showed false returns on falsified statement, nobody sold the investment to new investors to pay old investors

the "market" doesn't need regulation to pin specific crimes to him.  who knows about the law in tokyo, but there are many potential fraud crimes involved, and many interpretations of the law can be applied since there is a lot of grey area here.  either way, my comment was more geared toward the fact that "we need to put him there" is a ridiculous statement.  "we" arent the law.  "we" can meme him, that'll show him!

1. speculation
2. assumption
3. irrelevant
unless some really specific stuff comes out that turns this thing on it's head, it is in no way a ponzi scheme.  its a clusterfuck of idiocy at the moment, not a ponzi scheme.

? its not an upbeat positive attitude, its just using a word for a specific scheme that doesnt seem to apply.  personally i assume everyone had had anything at this "exchange" is fucked out of every penny, whether it is a hacker or an inside thief
