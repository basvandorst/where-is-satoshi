How come? Doesn't it seem strange that he isn't behind bars yet after all this? If it's an open and shut case of negligence and fraud there is no reason he'd still be free. Yes, Bitcoins aren't regulated like other markets but defrauding people on that scale is still punishable by law.
That's what leads me to believe there's a government behind this.

You sound pretty impatient to get your moonsuit. You should probably reevaluate your time-frame.

Wild Willy speculation:
- US shuts down Silk Road (early Nov 2013)
- US seizes SR coins, knowing they'll be able to liquidate them with auction. 
- MtGox is already in trouble with its USD accounts. They could have been facilitating money laundering / SR transactions and the US came down on them to help with their investigation.
- Now the US has all these coins, and Mark Karpeles in the palm of their hand which also happens to be the CEO of the biggest Bitcoin exchange. 
- The US wants coins to gain value to sell at a higher profit.
- The US tells Mark to run Willy on the exchange to beef up the price.

Well, his 4 step explanation was to setup a HD wallet, which is generally regarded as being better since it can generate multiple addresses from the same seed.

1. No, but it'd be wise to set up 2FA. You're only required to verify 2FA for withdrawals, not deposits.
2. There is no standard. You can use Authy and access 2FA from multiple devices. You don't have to use 2FA (although highly recommended), but yes once you've set it up you'll be required to provide the 2FA code to withdraw coins (you can adjust the threshold of when you get asked for it).

Happy to help. 


The docs are confusing and a little ambiguous. If you only have one 4GB USB and want persistent data, you'll need to first install Tails to a DVD and boot from that. Once booted, use the "Tails Installer" and use the "Clone &amp; Install" option to put Tails onto the USB.
IIRC, you setup persistence once you boot into the USB.


I haven't tried using VirtualBox for this, but if you can boot into Tails and recognize the USB when using "Tails Installer" it might work.

Yikes. Multiple login failures, takes forever to scan the QR code... This did not look *easy*.

This doesn't apply.
- if your multi-sig wallet is on your phone, then you can't make transactions so there's no reason for a confirmation text.
- if your phone is stolen and you try to make a purchase using another multi-sig wallet, on your desktop for instance, then the thief would be confirming your own transaction. No security problem there. 
Hopefully you put a pin lock on your phone and your wallet to keep them out, but in case you didn't:
1. Contact the service ASAP to let them know the phone was stolen so they don't sign any transactions.
2. Sweep the wallet to a new multi-sig address with the service using the backup you've made.
If the thief does get a hold of your wallet before you flag the phone as stolen and tries to sweep your funds, then the service calls, just like banks do today, and the thief can't verify your identity.
I still think it works.
@_date: 2014-05-17 22:38:55
Because if they allow wallets for Bitcoin, it's harder for them to justify to developers that they're banning its use for in-app purchases (where devs stand to gain the most, and where apple stands to lose the most).
In-app purchases represent more revenue for Apple than Apps themselves.

Umm, that's strange. Do you know how/where the QR code was generated (BIP38 encrypted?)? I don't know that I'll be able to help, but maybe someone else can use that info to help you.
Other things you can try:
- Can you see the private key or is it all encoded in the QR? If you can see it, you could try manually entering the key into a desktop wallet or on blockchain.info.
- Alternatively, you could try scanning it using a webcam and see if that works? There are plenty online:  
Blockchain.info's website can also scan using a webcam.
I hope this gives you some more ideas of what to try, and hopefully something works.

I don't think they answered your question, so I'll give it a shot. 
The system can't disappear with everyone's bitcoins, since as you've read from others' answers, it's decentralized and copies of the ledger are distributed all across the system (kind of like bit torrents).
For this to theoretically happen, you'd have to either delete all copies of that ledger from all the computers everywhere in the world, or shut off the Internet and send us right back to the dark ages.
I'd say that at this stage, neither option is feasible.

From [Bitcoin Talk](
[Sweep] is simply executing a transaction on the network. It's identical to if you had gone into your new wallet, generated a receiving address, then gone into the old app and sent all your coins to it. It creates a tx spending all your coins to the new address and sends it to the network.
[Import], will import the private keys to your new wallet, but won't touch the coins where they are. If someone else has access to those private keys, they will maintain access to them after import.

Yes, but ethnocentrism limits the view of the broader scope. Bitcoin is borderless, like the Internet.
It probably won't benefit you or me (living in western countries), in the same way it can for developing and under-developed countries right now.
I'm aware of the crazy dollar fear-mongering that goes on around here - I don't subscribe to the idea that the dollar is on the brink of collapse. I use Bitcoin because I like the technology, I think it is transformative, and I'm not against the idea of owning my own money. But I'm a techie, so this stuff is just cool to me.

In case you're serious and not just trolling: an offline generated paper wallet would have prevented this. There are safe solutions, and an online hot wallets is not the right way to store 50 bitcoins.
I store like 0.1 on blockchain.info for immediate spending. The rest is safe and has never been exposed to an Internet connection.

They're never stored on Blockchain.info (private entity). They're stored in the blockchain. 
All you need is your private key to unlock the funds (blockchain.info gives you those when you make backups), and you can either "import" or "sweep" the funds to a new wallet if Blockchain.info were to go down.
There's a slight difference between import and sweep, but I'll let you look those up.

I know it takes a bit of knowledge right now to generate cold storage addresses, but it's not that hard.
Get Tails (Linux) install on USB drive. Grab a copy of bitcoinpaperwallet via github and put it on another USB.
Now boot into Tails, stick your other USB in and extract the zip. Generate some addresses and save them as a PDF or text file and store them on that second USB.
Optionally, stick those addresses in a truecrypt container, or simply never plug in that second USB to another machine not using Tails.
You should be OK.

Maybe the consumer adoption side is a fad, but there are other uses for Bitcoin.
The reason I think Bitcoin will keep growing - whether the general public uses it or not - is that robots are going to use it.
The digital payments world is completely fragmented right now and nothing is compatible: Google Wallet, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, SnapCash, Square Cash, Venmo, Paypal... I can keep going if you'd like.
My point is: none of these is anywhere close to providing a standard that computers/people can use to send each other money across platforms.
Bitcoin can provide the standard for secure, international, and cross compatible money transfers without a middle man.

For people, it's not super simple to use yet. But that doesn't really matter. Computer to computer payments can be done right now, and that's what will enable the [Internet of Things]( to take off. 
The Bitcoin ecosystem benefits from being open. All the services I mentioned in my previous comment are using proprietary channels, and no one can really tap into them. Even if one of them does decide to let other people build on its system, that doesn't guarantee interoperability with other services. Consumers aren't going to want to install 10 different mobile wallet apps. They want to choose one, and have that work with everything else.
All I am arguing is that there needs to be a standard (because we're going to need machines to make payments) and that Bitcoin represents the safest and most open/interoperable money transfer system. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 04:17:03
