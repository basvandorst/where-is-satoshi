That is a terrible quote. Its less than 1% of the population who gets to be a basketball player.  
"We shouldn't write of this child's future because he has a less than 1% chance of making it big"   
Its like telling someone they should keep playing the lotto because there is a less than 1% chance of winning.   
Bitcoin is not a lottery, It is already the currency of the internet. It is already doing what it intended to do, It decentralizes currency.

Still early. Most of what we thought was people trading was actually money washing so I think there are less users than we all believe there are. What that means is that were still waiting for an adoption wave to pump prices.

I only hold BitCash because moon on coinpot gives it to me for free and then I convert it to regular bitcoin.

When they stop producing said model having one mint makes it go up in value. Special edition limited run like the centenario goes up in value after purchase because its hard to get on the purchase list in the first place. I watch way too many super car videos on youtube.

“Previous analyses have suggested that the coin’s value could jump as it becomes more scarce over time. Trusted crypto-analyst PlanB recently calculated that the coin could ten times its current worth to around £82,000 per Bitcoin by March 2020."
Okay then.

*"a computer which makes use of the quantum states of subatomic particles to store information."*
We can barely make carbon processors that are reliable right now.
[Engadget article from 2016 on carbon processors](
 [HDD Mag on Quantum computers]( 
Article suggests we are 20 years off from reliable quantum computing. But that is the opinion of a tech writer. Maybe exit bitcoin in 15 years to beat quantum computing /s

I browse my spam once in a while. Happened to get one of these emails asking for like $500 in bitcoin to not send it to my contacts. Dude also listed my email and one of my really old low effort passwords. It was like "caught you masturbating to transexuals on xhamster" or something like that. My email has been pwned 12 times im not falling for that crap. Check out your email on haveibeenpwned, you might actually be a target for these types of scams.

This is what I dislike about reddit. Subreddits that are within my interests but when I go to them they actually dont have anything to do with the topic because the people who got there first molded it in their vision.
