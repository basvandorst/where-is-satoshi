If you mean addresses from the screenshot that are just examples of prefilled claim, how it should be filled / looked. It's just an example, nothing more. I ask about choosing an appropriate address to claim - if it should be "deposit / withdraw wallet" or "exchange hot wallet", not directly addresses from the screenshot.

Yes, I tried 8BTC, but if you want to post or reply to something, you need to verify your phone number. It has to be the chinese phone number.
Do you know other similar chinese forums?

I also hope in this scenario. Maybe first regulation which support the Bitcoin price. :)

IP is personal data, likely also BTC address can be considered than personal data. So you're right. 
On other side, privacy coins / cryptocurrencies that ensure anonymity, could be more demanded by companies.

The trustee should announce the selling before doing that as some of you wrote. I guess, that more people check Mt.Gox wallets regularly / every day. If some of them noticed the transfer 16K BTC, they could be in panic and started to sell. It's normal in crypto, people are careful / frightened / hurried.
