Actually this is good point. According to the metrics they used - what the percentage would be for CC users? What about cash users? It these numbers are comparable (which I am pretty sure they will be... especially for cash users), than this study is not thing but attempt to smear bitcoin community.

You don’t have to be politically correct.  It is pretty obvious that the main goal of bitcash &amp; co is to keep transaction fee s high.

Actually at this point regulations are good news. If feds want to create regulations framework for crypto it means that they choose to embrace it... rather than try to ban it.

True. Crypto got critical mass. Nothing can stop it now.

NO. Currency of any kind is not the source of the problems... and hence it can not be a solution.

You maybe right, but the cash first mentality was very noticeable when I visited Berlin couple years ago. It was kind of annoying... I don’t usually carry enough cash in my pocket to pay for decent 3 person meal. I can (kind of) understand why customers will want to use cash... but why restaurants would refuse to deal with plastic and/or Apple Pay?

Not really... because you still need to have your key “cold stored” in some way... so basically you are back to square 1.

Probably some one should mention that the smallest denomination for Dongs is 500... and I only saw this denomination twice after spending 1/2 year in Vietnam. Often they will give you a mint as a change instead of 500. I assume situation is similar with other currencies.

Correct me if I am wrong, but as of now [Shared Coin]( is the only one who manage to implement "CoinJoin" and if you look into they FAQ


So if interested party can intercept and decrypt your communications with conjoin server or even worse compromise this server (or get a subpoena which is pretty much the same), than you end up having no anonymity at all.
Other problem is technically illiterate court system. In the US chances of getting judge and/or jury which will understand anything about how bitcoin works are negligible. So the fact that it is "… impossible to **prove** …" become very moot point.

Is there some kind of list of BTC friendly banks?  Not necessarily uS based, but willing to deal with uS citizens. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 02:31:36
I just started to learn about all things bitcoin, so please correct me if I am wrong. Isn't  CoinJoin just a glorified example of "security via obscurity"?  Pretty much every single post about CoinJoin has disclaimer that it does not make de-anonymisation impossible. Just somewhat difficult.  From what I read so far, Zerocoin sounds like much better alternative (assuming all high end crypto voodoo they are using really works).

This is why both: wallet and banking apps are perfectly kosher from Apple point of view.

Does it mean that Chase as an institution is BTC friendly?  I am considering investing to BTC, but I can not afford my banking account been terminated because of it. Is there any solid evidence that Chase (or any other bank serving US customers) is BTC friendly ?

Scrypt proved to be not as ASIC resistant as it was hoped for. This would not "buy" us much in terms of raining in ASICs.

True. I just used "security-through-obscurity" because this phrase is used much more often. Privacy through obscurity is much more correct label.

This is quite stupid article. Comparing apples and oranges. What ever Apple is going to do in regards to payment system it is not going to "fight" with bitcoin. Instead it will compete against al these other "quick" payment systems/technologies (all these touch to pay things). And most importantly it still will be using $$$.  
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:16:57
How?  From what I read so far all it does is trying to make it difficult to trace "ownership" through all intermediate transactions. But due to he nature of the bitcoin all these intermediate transactions are still public knowledge and as such could be analyzed (and de-anonymized). 
@_date: 2013-12-24 08:27:09
I say that it is quite possible that this would be the case. Especially if u limit distribution to Germany. In any case, you will have very good argument to present to Apple if they decline and in my experience, if u have good argument you have a good chance to win approval.

Google valet is most certainly not in Apple iTunes Store. PayPal exist only in form of PayPal Now - which is essentially equivalent of Square which does not accept payments on behalf of the App creator, but only on behalf of App user. And all banking apps arguable don't accept payments from user, they just allow user to move hist/here money around (which is not violation of Apple terms). 
Bottom line, Apple does have a fairly well defined rules in regards to accepting payments in-app and it follows these rules rather strictly.

There are very few reason to like JP, unless you are CEO or part of the board.

The rejection, [Gliph CEO Rob] Banagale notes, was based largely off of section 22.1 of Apple’s App Store review guidelines. The rule states that “apps must comply with all legal requirements in any location where they are made available to users. It is the developer’s obligation to understand and conform to all local laws.”
Bitcoin is not illegal, but it is also not legally recognized by governments as a currency. This gray area is what is leading Apple to reject Bitcoin-transaction apps.

Inforgrams annoy me greatly. They are more or less OK for explaining simple concepts, but for anything slightly more complicated they become useless very quickly. They give uneducated user false sense of been educated. When you read white paper, you know exactly which parts of it you did not understand (so you can either give up or keep digging). When you look at pretty pictures... everyone should understand pretty pictures. Right? Wrong. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 04:18:59
I stand corrected on these two, but my main point still stand. Apple take cut from all payments done to app "owner" and it prohibit any alternative forms of payment to enforce this cut. However if the App just facilitate payments between user and random third parties (like google wallet, pay pal or any other banking apps) it is not subject for Apple tax. The rational (from Apple point of view) - Apple spend significant $$$ to build and maintain App Store. When developer choose to market his/here app via Apple App Store, they have to repay Apple. 
Bottom line, Bitcoin wallets should be kosher from Apple point of view, but accepting payments in Bitcoins (or any other way different from the Apple payments) is not. 
Edit:  I stand corrected one more time :(

Bitcoin in its current form is less of a money and more of investment. Mostly because of price volatility. However over time, bitcoin price will stabilize and than it will become form of money. At the same time, issues of inflation (or deflation - though mostly inflation) do affect fiat currency as well. It is not specific to bitcoin. If "price" of currency change significantly any "long term" transactions (like loans) become problematic.
