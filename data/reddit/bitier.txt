BTC-e is the only one I know about.
@_date: 2015-06-29 17:53:14
Maybe because it is already above market price for the asset?  I don't really know.

That article is old.  I don't know of a miner that is shipping that will ROI.  Anyone making miners like that is making them and mining with them.

Maybe you shouldn't have ignored the email they sent you then.

I don't see what is so hard about buying bitcoin on your own.  Less risk is more better.
@_date: 2015-06-29 23:41:33
You made the same mistake more than once.  Kind of like Garza...

It matters because people who are not open about their identity when it comes to doing business might have something to hide.  This plus the fact that they run a cloud mining business(scam) makes me question them.  For all you know this is another Homero Joshua Garza scam.

They didn't have an option for Euro for Bitstamp so I chose USD.  You will need to find the USD &gt; EUR exchange rate for that too.
@_date: 2015-06-29 15:31:01
They're probably looking to spread out their risk.  No one really knows if this will end with Greece or impact the rest of the Euro so being 100% Euro may not be appealing to some people.
@_date: 2015-06-23 17:04:32
Your anecdotal submission contradicts my own experiences immensely. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 23:55:56
No, someone is trying to hide their identity so that when they scam you, it's harder for you to find them.
@_date: 2015-06-29 23:36:43

Educate yourself.
@_date: 2015-06-29 23:02:23
Honestly, your defensive stance doesn't really help you.
  


  
Yea, like Garza has never used multiple accounts to scam people.  So this is just a long con on your(Garza's) part.
  


  
  


  
Garza is also very organized.

The obvious point is that just because you accuse coinbase of being a "trainwreck" doesn't mean that it is true.  Especially when it contradicts my years of experience with coinbase.

Max Keiser and Stacy Herbert are a great team and one of the few that is out there fighting the corruption and trying to truly educate the masses.  The fact that they are partnered with Russia Today says a lot about their message.  As someone who grew up during the cold war, it is very strange seeing truth tellers like Snowden and Keiser having to rely on Russia in order to get the truth out.

He's right, tokens aren't needed to run your own blockchain.  But they are most definitely needed to make something like bitcoin work.  Nobody secures a network for free and the bitcoin network is the largest, most secure and most resistant to central authority.

Thanks for being honest.

This is kind of crazy to me since the very act of proving you own them can jeopardize your cold storage.  Every time you access your private keys, you put them at risk and you would need to sign all of the addresses holding your coins in order to comply.  I would respectfully decline and explain that you do not want to put your cold storage at risk and if they are not happy with that, take your business elsewhere.

I thought that timestamps on the blockchain were not to be trusted.  This was one of the first things I learned when getting into bitcoin, has something changed over the last several years?
@_date: 2015-06-29 16:20:00


Bitcoin has been going up over the last few weeks so I disagree.

It is up over its lifetime(by a lot).  It has been through several bubbles already and at this point we can say it is healthy.
  
I bought at 32 dollars so I guess I see a lot more utility than you.

I am giving them the benefit of the doubt.  I think it's unlikely Coinbase made a mistake, they have been spot-on up to this point.  But if they did buy from Coinbase and just sent them to cold storage where they did not move, then Coinbase is asking for too much.
@_date: 2015-06-30 14:39:14
I didn't buy into your scam.

You can be very organized but still do very stupid things, look at Ulbricht for an example.
@_date: 2015-06-29 15:21:44
Good luck, there is too much risk involved in selling a non-reversible currency for a reversible one.  Most places will make you wait for your coin or want ID verification because it would be too easy to buy BTC with stolen plastic.
