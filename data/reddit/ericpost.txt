Bitcoin will never be mainstream because governments have to tax income and purchases and production. You simply cannot allow people to evade this. 
For example how many people would pay income tax if it wasn't deducted from your check each pay period? Some would but a vast majority would pay any or would cheat a lot. This is why the government requires a "pay as you go" system.

Bitcoin will never be mainstream until there is a reason for it. The reason to use it is you're hiding something. The current banking system works because I have nothing to hide, so why should I care. 
If I don't want something tracked, I would use physical cash. 
Of course the answer comes back, you "should" not want anything tracked. But again, the answer is what's wrong with being tracked? 
To wit, people will say "you don't understand if you allow yourself to be tracked." 
And you have a circular argument. This is like saying you should go miles out of your way to avoid red light cameras or don't walk down any street in NYC or Chicago or any other major city that has cameras from every building recording you. 
Bottom line: Right now the sole reason to use Bitcoin is to cover your tracks, which can be accomplished much easier with cash. So there is no reason to adopt it.

You are correct, all you have to do is look at eBay to see how the pendulum swung from the early years when sellers were ripping off buyers. This is WHY eBay now favors the buyers. You have to err on their side and provide them with the protection.

I had three bitcoins I got almost right at the start. I sold them a long while back for $250 each. I was so happy. Things happen. 
The other day I had my stock take off, I had 5,000. It was going up and down and seemed to settle around $33/share. I put a stop loss at $29.05, then left for lunch. An hour later I cam back and all my stock was sold for that and the stock was now back up to $34. 
Sometimes you don't foresee correctly.
