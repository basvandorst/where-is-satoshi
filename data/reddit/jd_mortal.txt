If you accept "bitcoins" as "bitcoins", they are worth whatever value you set them as, for payment. (Taxes are due, based on that income.)
However, if you do not cash them out, and at the time you cash them out... (Should be before the end of the tax season for businesses.) The "gains and losses", the difference from the value of what they were at the time you acquired them, for x-dollars in value of services or goods, is the "gain or loss".
Eg... If you say "give me x-bitcoins", for $20.00 in goods, you are "buying $20.00 worth of BTC from them, in exchange for $20.00 of goods." You owe taxes on $20.00 worth of income. However, if you do not cash-out for $20.00, that is your choice, and are still responsible for the taxes on the exchange of $20.00 of goods. If you cash-out and it is $10.00, then you have a tax-write-off, of $10.00, essentially, for "gains and losses". The $10.00 cash-out would not be worth the savings of having only paid for $10.00 worth of tax. Though, if you cash-out and get $40.00 from that original $20.00 of BTC... You have now made a "gain", and must ALSO pay a gain tax of $20.00 income-tax, on top of the original $20.00 income-tax. (Eg, not paying luxury "gains" on $40.00 because $20.00 of that $40.00 was your initial "buy" or your, "non-loss or gain".)
Now... this will screw you over... Some "states", don't care what you paid, or exchanged. They force you to pay based on "value at the time of holding", even if you have not cashed-out. So if the price goes up to $1200/BTC again, and you got them at $120/BTC, you have to pay taxes on $1080.00 gain, pre BTC that you are holding. Since that is the "fair market value" at the time they are in your possession. If you don't cash-out, that isn't their concern. Most smart people will cash-out to cover the taxes, which also lowers your holdings... Smarter ones cash-out at that moment completely, then use that money to buy more on the next low, or cover the expenses of the things they sold.
Like it was said, if you use a service to "pay in BTC", but you "get cash", then you are just dealing with cash and normal taxes. You never actually own the BTC, so the source of income is irrelevant, as well as the price at the time. (The service may hold-on for better prices or risk losses, but that is on them, not you.)
Though, honestly, unless you tell them your bitcoin address, then they have no clue which ones are yours. Unless  you use a bitcoin service that identifies you, to the IRS, or links your bank-account to a bitcoin address/transaction. (Which they might do, so it doesn't look like they own the coins and they don't have to pay taxes on your transactions.)
