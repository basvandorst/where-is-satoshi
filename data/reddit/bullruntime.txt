Coinbase used to allow SMS for two-factor.  It's probably cases like this that forced them to stop.

Services like this are not selling privacy, they are selling obfuscation that can be broken.  It isn't real privacy compared to coins built to be private like monero.

Sounds like a tax which some governments are already collecting.

Pretty much everything you don't like about Bitcoin isn't Bitcoin itself but the community or some perceived deficiency. You mentioned earlier that you think people in certain countries need a system like Bitcoin but then disparage it for not being as easy to secure as cash(which I disagree with) without acknowledging that there is a cost for the system and that has to come from somewhere.  I've been using Bitcoin for longer than most and I have not lost or been scammed out of a single satoshi and I have spent trillions of them.

Looking through the daily discussion today is a great reminder why I rarely posted.  Seriously, fuck the mods.  You suck so fucking bad, allowing day old accounts to troll the fuck out of bitcoin fans in their own daily.  I'm out.
@_date: 2018-11-22 17:30:50


  
So because people made money last year and posted about it, you're here calling it a scam a year later?  Sounds like you're the one who needs to take medicine.

Job growth year over year is actually down since Obama left office so there is one trend.
@_date: 2018-11-22 20:05:42
What country?  Because 4.1k is really low but I'm just assuming you are talking about USD.
@_date: 2018-11-17 00:02:53
That all sounds reasonable to me.  My advice would be to focus on your disillusionment and how you have arrived at it.  When you look at Bitcoin objectively there isn't much room for doubt about its future.  Even the price is amazing given where we were just a few years ago.  And if you focused on peoples comments around here a few years ago, you'd have been doubting Bitcoin just as you are right now but probably worse since we have another bull run under our belt at this point.

There's nothing wrong with being excited about going from 1k to almost 20k in a single year.  Especially if you bought in years earlier and had been holding the whole time.   Most of us continually warned new comers looking to invest that we didn't know what would happen and not to get in with more than they can afford to lose.  You're of course ignoring this because it invalidates your faux outrage about our excitement.  Go ask your mom when dinner will be ready.

Who's dick did you have to suck to get your reddit account?  Because last time I checked you can make them all day long for free.

He would need to own a large amount of BTC to be phased so that makes sense.
@_date: 2018-11-22 20:27:19
You aren't scared because the repercussions of having trace amounts of cocaine on your fiat money is well quantified.  The repercussions of having tainted coins or using mixers is not so your comparison isn't "like" like you claim.
@_date: 2018-11-22 19:42:32
Yep.  Everyone nominated me before they went to the bathroom.  They'll be back shortly.  They said to tell you to fuck off and get a life.
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:38:19
You're trolling and you suck at it.  
@_date: 2018-11-22 19:34:37
What OTC market?
@_date: 2018-11-17 16:23:23
Bitcoin solves issues of trust and that is its intrinsic value.  You can't program a gold bar to automatically split itself and deliver itself to multiple parties when certain conditions are met but you can with bitcoin.  And you can do it without trusting anyone.
@_date: 2018-11-22 19:38:19
Sounds great until you get tainted coins or an exchange decides they don't like customers who use mixers and decides to be prejudice towards you.  Doesn't have to be today, it can happen at any time.  
@_date: 2018-11-22 17:20:01
If you were actually here or took the time to look at threads in the past or were just arguing in good faith you would know that nobody here says you're going to get rich quick and almost every thread asking if they should invest warns them of the volatility and suggests not to get in with anything but a long term outlook in years.  So your bullshit submission meant to antagonize and troll us on this fine day of feasts can fuck right off.
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:20:52
There will always be someone to buy.  The only thing that will change is the price.  If you had told people a few years ago that Bitcoin would be over 4k right now they'd have laughed at you.  
@_date: 2018-11-16 23:28:25
That's some solid analysis, it's hard to argue with those numbers.
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:23:36
Bitcoin didn't exist in 08/07.
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:42:33
Awkward?  My relatives think I'm a genius for calling the last bubble and keep asking me when it is alright to buy again. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 20:48:07


  
I guess I have a problem with calling it privacy when you are relying on authorities to not take action.  I see these discussions a lot around here and it always boils down to a claimed plausible deniability.  That's what's being sold and I call it inferior to actual privacy.
@_date: 2018-11-22 18:26:44
It is secure.  There is no way anyone is spending that Bitcoin without the keys!

Someones going to wack him if he keeps it up regardless of whether he is lying.  He is the one creating the perception that he is messing with peoples money.

This fork nonsense looks like a marketing campaign to pump a dying coin.
@_date: 2018-11-16 23:20:53
What does that even mean?  Your comment is a word soup.
  
What situation?  
What realism is being diminished?  
Any old fork or specific forks?
@_date: 2018-11-16 23:43:50
That was a real rebuttle.  You admit that you formed your opinion based on reddit comments.  Reddit is a social platform with a low barrier to entry and is used to manipulate opinions on the daily.
   


  
Do you have any evidence that it isn't what Satoshi hoped it would be?  Because that is what you are implying.
  
I'm pretty sure you're just here to troll since WSB is boring after the markets are close.
