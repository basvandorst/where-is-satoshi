I often wondered how high the chances might be that Satoshi forgot or lost one of his secure keys.
Also, how much computing power would it need to brute force a secure key. I know that it's incredibly difficult if he chose a complex long string, but let's assume he didn't.

I do trust Gavin, too, but I'm not really sure what happened here. And Gavin is not stupid, he had to know that people would be incredibly sceptical and would want public proof. Speaking of the latter, the whole point of Bitcoin was that you don't have to trust institutions but can trust the signatures, that's the base of the whole thing, why the hell wouldn't you use that system then?
If this is a scam by Mr. Wright, I have to give him kudos for doing the whole thing though.

I think you're misunderstanding my point or I'm not getting yours correctly. Let me address what I meant and give you my assessment of Wikileaks then.
The concept of "scientific journalism" is trying to close the gap between newspaper and the reader. The newspaper knows more than the reader as it does have the primary source of what it's reporting. The reader only gets the newspaper's version of that primary source. The idea of "scientific journalism" is to give the reader access to the primary source as well, so she can make her own assumptions about the way the newspaper portrayed its content. If a newspaper got its hands on a secret document, we don't know if they're leaving anything out in their reporting unless we have access to that document as well.
Now to Wikileaks, when they started out, you could send them documents and they would publish them after checking their validity. They published *everything*. Once they sent a Newsletter and accidentally put the BCC into the CC, so all newsletter recipients were revealed, someone sent them that very list, and they ended up publishing that, too. The whole mantra was: here's the place for the prime sources of everything. While I strongly disagree with publishing everything (they published the list of the members of British National Party), I did like the idea of providing primary sources a lot. I still think it's one of the best ideas that journalism has seen in decades.
That said, after the War Logs, and especially after the Iraq video titled "Collateral Murder" they got famous over night, and the whole thing broke apart. People left the organization, Assange's character wasn't very helpful, they made horrendous errors in not blacking information and the dumping of the cables was pretty much a huge fuck up on their part. That is what I am sad about, when I think about them. I think they had potential to create something valuable, become an institution and employ journalists in the long run. And I don't think they were like 4chan right before their peak. I think, they sort of got there eventually, though: they made some crucial mistakes, and went into hardcore "everything is a conspiracy"-mode.

Let's say Satoshi wants to come out of the darkness, she just wants to get some money. What should she do? Destroy some bitcoins and drive the price up that way? Or wait till the "last" coin got mined?
@_date: 2016-05-03 13:50:14
I think that actually made sense. As the only authority he left it, so it could be developed for its own sake.

I liked Dorian a lot.

Actually, we don't know a thing. That's the whole point here. We don't know what happened at all. You are speculating and making stuff up.

Finney died in August 2014, the last Nakamoto message ever was the post on the p2p forums by his account in May or June 2014 if I'm not mistaken.
I also liked the names the Fast company guy came up with.

Mh, that's not very nuanced. When Wikileaks started, their mantra was to publish anything, it was supposed to be something closer to Wikipedia, where everyone could participate in some form or fashion, providing a basis for what Assange defined as "scientific journalism", giving people the underlying data to news stories so they can check facts and narrative themselves.
Of course, with the Manning leaks, a few key things happened. Wikileaks published parts of the Iraq war logs without blacking out names of informants and agents, and then the whole debacle with the diplomatic cables happened, where a passphrase to open the whole collection was published in a book by the Guardian.
What I'd say is that Wikileaks had huge problems that Assange doesn't like to admit. I still think that the underlying idea was and is brilliant, and I do think that the organization was treated horribly, the blockade of payment providers by direct influence through US politics is comically absurd.
It's sad to see the whole thing fallen like this. 2010/2011 Wikileaks started becoming a phenomenon, they really changed things up for a short while, Assange got popstar status, and journalism seemed freaking exciting to a lot of people.

That's not common sense, you just had a predisposition that turned out right. It's just fatalist "I told you so", it's literally adding nothing.
@_date: 2016-05-03 13:13:49
Well, there's one way to answer, right? We need another "actual" Satoshi.

PayPal is shitty as fuck.
Bitcoin is user-unfriendly as hell.
@_date: 2016-05-04 15:41:41
Okay, but can't you see value in the concept of scientific journalism? It's very big feature is that no one can decide what is reported on, it's an attempt to eliminate as much bias as possible. I do agree that their security and fact checking was terrible and stupid.
And Assange, well, that's a whole different topic. Let's just say we have a difficult relationship.

It would be hilarious if Statorshy is the actual name of a man or a woman who invented Bitcoin. And the whole bit was to choose a name so similar that no one would ever look for it.

He absolutely understands them, I don't doubt his abilities one bit, but they could all be 50% shorter.

Well, you seemed to have missed a crucial point of mine, or I wasn't articulating it properly. The raw data that is published should always be redacted. The redacted raw data does serve a purpose, it holds the news organization accountable to a certain degree. Please don't confuse that with Wikileaks the organization and some of their decisions. That's why I'm always talking about the concept of scientific journalism not Wikileaks itself.
My whole criticism about Wikileaks was that they didn't redact information properly, thus giving millions of people access to possible names of informants, and so on. Wikileaks actually learned from their mistakes with the War Logs where they didn't do the proper work, and tried to publish the cables slowly, but because of a security leak, the whole database was eventually accessible to everyone. This and the failure to educate Manning on secure procedures are the three key things where I think they messed up big time.

Cult personalities aren't worth much. Look at how Gavin treated like now. He definitely didn't have the following, but people used to think highly of him for the most part and now everyone trashes him and call him naive although there's no real indication he was.

As I understood it, the email just expired on GMX and someone signed up with the existing name. I don't think we know for sure if that person actually got access to private emails or not. And we also don't know who that person is.
@_date: 2016-05-03 21:27:07
If I remember correctly, GMX just canceled the email because it expired, and the "hacker" signed up for a new account with the same handle.
@_date: 2016-05-06 13:54:55
I doubt it was a hack. Were all other comments by SN signed?

It's not embarrassing at all. They were shown a private key possession that seemed legit, so they had faith he'd provide the necessary proof after all. What should they have done? Declined?
