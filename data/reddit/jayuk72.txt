I have made several deposits via UK NatWest &amp; Coinbase using SEPA.
I have only verified my bank once using a €6 deposit. 
Then I just send from my bank making sure I use the correct Reference number coinbase provide.
I'm a little confused why you'd be asked to verify again to be honest :/

If you go to gdax.com and login with your coinbase credentials you will be able to deposit your Euros for free then buy at the market rate on the exchange meaning less in fees.
I too bought through Coinbase until I discovered their exchange.

I'm in UK and purchased through coinbase instantly with credit card a while back, should be the same for you - just use the 'buy' button on bitcoin.
Not gonna get into fees and stuff but it's easy enough to do

I'm really not sure then.
It is straight forward for me.
Euro wallet &gt; withdraw &gt; select my bank &gt; hit confirm &gt; money back on account in 48hrs
Sorry I can't help more :/

Yes only Euros through SEPA - I have just made a transfer to UK.
You have to verify your UK bank account by sending €6 euros to an Estonian Coinbase Bank Account. My bank charged me £10 for the pleasure.
I couldn't get IBAN working until I removed all spaces from it, there was a weird glitch on the IBAN input putting a rouge space in.
All worked out but is a faff
