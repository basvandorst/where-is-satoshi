the ironic part is that this most likely has nothing to do with bitcoin/coinbase, but with the ACH transfer/banks. It would be like blaming Amazon because UPS lost your shipment in the mail. Of course there is a chance that I am wrong and coinbase screwed up, but more than likely not.

Too bad local municipalities in the US sign agreements with telco's such as Comcast or Verizon that allows only them to build out and use the infrastructure. My friend who lives in West Virginia, his district signed a contract until 2125 that states only Time Warner Cable can build and use the infrastructure in their area. It is not a free market. In fact it is probably the farthest you can possibly get from a free market

You can enter your credit card and buy bitcoin instantly without a wait period. For coinbase it takes a bit more time to set up,  and only the highest tier is instant buy. If you already have coinbase set up,  then circle is not much different.

Your argument is absolutely ridiculous. If I run an article saying "cdelango likes to burn babies in his backyard, he admitted it to me" with no hard evidence like a recording, then you publicly say to other news outlets "I don't do that" and they have a recording of it, people are supposed to believe me over you? Go back to your cave troll

how the fuck is it the wrong subreddit? reddit is usually my source of fun/down time, not a source of anger and hatred. where else would it have been applicable? I was wondering where all those posts went.

You can probably just leave out your input addresses...for what they are trying to do I don't think they are really relevant

IANAL, but if something actually happened to him, would there be grounds to charge Newsweek or possibly the journalist with accessory to murder or something? I'm just curious how that would work. I'm sure there are protections in place for journalists but I'd imagine there is a limit to what is protected

I understand but according to OP FIFO is encouraged and LIFO is looked down upon at best, illegal at worst. That is my point. And since it's retroactive, all those tiny purchases I made earlier in the year have now fucked my royally

Damn dude I can't even imagine putting in the effort for all this. I've made about as many transactions, but I've also small time mined about 18 other currencies over the past year. Reporting all that would take me weeks

This is awesome. Definitely look into commercializing this...or at the very least shopping it around to companies that are already trying to expand into this market.

yeah I believe the term is being an "accredited investor". From my understanding (which could be wrong), it requires you to have a substantial amount of wealth, something like $250,000 minimum in available assets. And on top of that if you become an accredited investor, there are all sorts of limitations and rules on what you can and cannot invest in. Basically, a huge pain in the ass haha. 
Here's to the future!

Good points. Welp....now I am even more cynical. Just added yet another reason that I need to get the fuck out of America before shit hits the fan. It pains me to say, but this country and its corruption is a joke

Umm they are? BitPay has published several BIPs as well as many other companies

Yeah....it's bleak. The only differentiation is that to fix this wholesale across the country requires a law passed by Congress. The most plausible would be for them to finally deem broadband providers as "common content providers". This would give the FCC the legal precedence to decide on net neutrality, otherwise they are powerless. Of course designating them as CCP's seems ridiculously obvious, but America is a place ruled by corporate interests, not by common sense. The government restrictions being made now are done by local municipalities, something that no one in America really pays attention to (which is a whole different topic to talk about). 
Our only real ray of sunshine in this is the fact that litigation will be funded on both sides by corporations. On the one hand we have Verizon, Comcast, TWC, etc., but on the other side are players such as Google, Yahoo, MSoft, Netflix, etc. They have a lot to lose if this makes it all the way through the Supreme Court, so you can count on them to fight this tooth and nail.

That would work if you were using LIFO reporting...which according to dblcross121 is ill-advised. Hence why it sucks a fat one lol

Honestly I probably should have done a bit more due-diligence on the investigative side before investing, but I bought about 2000 units yesterday. 
At this point all my BTC holding is "play money", as in I already cashed out my initial investment, so I am a little bit more lenient with investments like this. If it tanks to 0, it doesn't hurt quite as much if I had invested USD that I earned at my job through hard work. Still the same loss, and doesn't make much sense from an analytic/logic standpoint, but it does from an emotional/human one.
Regardless of SFI's success/failure, I must say the steps to invest in an IPO like this are dead simple. As a proof of concept for future investments, this is **VERY** encouraging. I came across SFI last night, did some research. Once I committed to the idea, it took about 2-3 minutes to create an account at havelock, 10 seconds to send the funds, 10-15 minutes for a few confirmations, and I bought the units in 3 seconds after the BTC showed up on havelock. All in all, something that would take days of time and miles of red tape and regulations took less than an hour. And the best part is that I could have bought 5 units or something silly like that if I wanted to, no restrictions at all. 
Even if SFI falls flat on it's face, I feel confident that many more IPO's and investment vehicles of similar nature will be popping up. If my investment in SFI encourages other companies to do the same, I figure that already makes it worthwhile for me.
Needless to say, I'm excited to see where this goes.

What terrifies me the most is that we are recommended to use FIFO and not LIFO. That means the bitcoin I've had in cold storage for a year that I bought at $90 is basically pointless. If I buy $5 worth of BTC today so that I can spend it on a beer, I just got taxed out the ass.....greeeeaaatttttt

ever try Dojo? I like their take on the Javascript/OOP conundrum. Been using that for my most recent projects

The key is that it's not just "a technology to become widely used". It's "a technology to become widely used that would cause a massive shift in the economic demographics of the world, putting power in the hands of the small and taking it from the hands of the big". 
Something like the internet is a semi-comparable technology though. Although the rise of the internet didn't change the financial sector much (which is the biggest/baddest of them all), it certainly gives power to the masses by being able to transmit news instantaneously around the world. With a power such as that, we have seen the internet banned/regulated heavily in countries such as China, Iran, Egypt, etc etc.
So internet is one example of a technology partially "struck down" by gov't regulations. The difference is that in a government's eyes, the internet has both good and bad qualities. Sure your citizens can get more news, but you can also spy on their every move and can alter what they see depending on the situation (Chinese firewall as an example). But for BTC, in the eyes of a government, it is only harmful. To them, it brings nothing positive to the table. All they see is a huge revolution in the way they make and control their country's money. So they will try their damnedest to stop it.
@_date: 2013-11-12 18:23:33
as annoying as this is, it definitely isn't coinbase specific. I've had to answers those bullshit multiple choice questions for all sorts of stuff. the "which road is closest to you" question is always the worst.

This is true, but that assumes all the miners who joined that pool were in on it too....which is unlikely. If you are going to go that route, it's probably more likely that a bank would just buy enough hardware to do it themselves...assuming there is enough hardware available for them to do that
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:51:29
Good point, although I don't necessarily see taxes/regulations of that nature as a bad thing. It's not like BTC was just going to magically avoid all taxation. In fact, clear and to the point laws about taxation, IMO, would legitimize it even more. 
What I fear is someone like the US or China saying "hey, if you publicly adopt, accept or back BTC in any way, we will put up an embargo and stop trade with you" (which is a tactic the US and China have both threatened and used many times). If that happens, we can pretty much kiss the BTC train goodbye.
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:08:23
If they didn't play nice, the approval rating of bitcoin would drop significantly because people would lose faith, and that would cause the current valuation to drop drastically. That means the BTC they are mining is now worth significantly less. It is in their best interest to see bitcoin prosper
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:26:35
Yeah that is true. We've been seeing positive news out of countries like Switzerland, but I worry if this is a sort of "chicken and the egg" problem.
We have just started to see an uptick in useful services/products being made available that revolve around BTC because it's gaining the attention from the big boys (US, China, etc). Companies such as Coinbase, BitPay, and all the new exchanges popping up, among many others, etc. etc. But in order for these companies to remain successful, they need the popularity/traffic that the US and Chinese markets give them. If the big boys drop out, then these services being provided are no longer profitable, they go the way of the dinosaur, and now the smaller countries back out because the BTC market is nowhere near what it used to be and no longer offers the same level of usefulness that it previously did.
Honestly the more I think about it, the more I think we are fucked. While governments might not be able to outright "ban" bitcoin in the literal sense, they can certainly put a fence around many outside factors that would make such a "ban" quite plausible in a round about way. The only hope at the end of the tunnel I can see is another financial crisis (particularly in the US, maybe once the student debt bubble collapses), that would make BTC more desirable to the masses (thanks to conventional market instability), and with a huge public outcry, maybe we could force some regulatory changes.
