In that case I will consider them for my next round of domain registrations. Currently I'm using OpenSRS (Tucows) but that's only because they're integrated with my hosting company.

Thanks. I have the wallet encrypted with the client encryption and also have it backed up on a TrueCrypt container.

Thanks, this is very useful. One other quick question: why is this post and my comments being downvoted?
I don't particularly care about the karma but it seemed to be a reasonable question from a newbie. Have I made a big no-no in the BitCoin community by asking?

It's nearly done now so hopefully another day should do it. I did some research before installing and expected it to take a while but not this long! Anyway, thanks again for the tips.

Great thank you. Well, while I have your attention, I might as well take you up on the offer :-) It's only slightly related to the topic though but is what got me thinking about mining--or not, as the case may be.
I chose to try out BitCoin QT and so far it's taking more than a week to sync with the blockchain. (That's non-continuous i.e. I turn off the computer at night but it's on all day.) My computer crashed at one point and now BitCoin QT has been reindexing blocks for two days before resuming the sync.
Is this a normal experience or is my hardware totally inadequate? I'm using a 2.53GHz Intel Core 2 Duo MacBook Pro.
Sorry, this isn't meant to be a personal IT support question :-) I'm the first person in my group to try out BitCoin and tasked with reporting back in the hope of convincing them to try it out too. Obviously I don't want to give them the wrong impression by incorrectly saying that it takes ages just to get going.

May I ask why this is? I've heard of them but never used their services.

Any idea what's the time for ROI on FPGA and ASIC mining hardware? (Assuming of course that the price trends don't drastically change for the worse.)
@_date: 2013-06-04 10:06:30
OK, thanks. I figured it might not be worth mining for profit these days, unless you want to spend some serious time and money on hardware.

I see. Do you know of a good source for BitCoin best practices?

Where can I learn more about this? I'm just getting into BitCoin and so far haven't encountered mention of it in bitcoin.org and weusecoins.com.
I assume that publicly-known private key address is one that got loose somehow e.g. after a hack. Why would someone import it?
