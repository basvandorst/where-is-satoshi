I'm bleeding out of my anus because of Bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:31:47
How much for a prisoner?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:16:13
Anyone got a link to Lightening they’re talking about?
@_date: 2015-12-25 14:03:17
27th/s gets me around 1btc a week. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 13:05:19
I don't even see anything about the bitfury miner. I need a machine(s) that is mining around 1btc a week
@_date: 2015-12-31 12:24:07
I'm curious about this as well
@_date: 2015-12-25 14:50:03
This is why I want to get miners, just need to decide which one to get
@_date: 2015-12-25 13:19:22
@_date: 2015-12-25 13:09:59
I was going to buy after. "Buy high, sell low" that's my model. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 17:35:16
@_date: 2015-12-25 14:49:16
So a place to store btc without worrying that it'll get stolen?
@_date: 2015-12-25 13:28:00
What is it?
@_date: 2015-12-25 14:16:41
I have free electricity 
@_date: 2017-02-28 13:50:35
I wish I could buy $5 coins. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 02:18:31
I wish I understood all this
@_date: 2017-02-15 00:36:28
Is that the next halving?
@_date: 2017-02-14 02:51:04
I like how with keep key you can send the BTC in the future 
Edit to clarify: you can send .75btc in 3hrs from now. That's a cool feature 
@_date: 2017-02-14 16:59:30
Can you explain?
@_date: 2017-02-19 11:21:35
Jam away 
@_date: 2017-02-13 15:54:22
What if I have a monthly pass? Is the bus wheel chair accessible and does it have a bike rack?
@_date: 2016-03-21 16:21:08
I had instant coin, now it's gone!!
@_date: 2016-03-21 16:48:53
Coinbase was doing fine when I was getting my btc instantly. Local Botcoins is a pain in the ass with having to go to western union etc
@_date: 2016-03-21 16:34:25
I didn't hit the limit. You can only contact them via email which is lame
@_date: 2016-03-21 14:17:09
Why the FUCK is this getting down voted? Assholes 
@_date: 2016-03-21 14:16:49
What a joke. I'm doing a direct bank withdrawal. I expected to have btc today instead I'll have it Friday. Fucken Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-02-28 19:59:18
That's terrible. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:47:43
Welcome to fucken Bitcoin

Purple monkey dishwasher!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-02-24 03:06:40
Wtf does this mean???
@_date: 2017-02-14 23:43:40
How do I set up multisig? Can I do it with Electrum? 
Isn't a hardware wallet a good way to store the coins long term?
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:20:14
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:55:35
Will a VPN block this back door because it's encrypted?
@_date: 2017-02-12 22:15:34
Can I have a coin?
@_date: 2017-03-11 01:27:44
Knowfing 
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:40:31
What about Monero?
@_date: 2016-03-21 14:32:32
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:53:26
Will a VPN block my camera and microphone being able to be remotely accessed?
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:20:12
Holy fuck
@_date: 2017-03-11 00:18:09
My penis
@_date: 2017-03-02 00:05:26
I have a lot of problems with purse. I have to reset my password everytime I log in it's a pain in my asshole. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:05:21
No. Dipshit. I have citizenship for 2 countries. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 12:33:27
What time should we expect a decision?
@_date: 2016-03-21 13:08:29
Coinbase. Sorry /Coinbase sub wouldn't let me post there 
@_date: 2017-02-14 02:41:32
Fuck I max out at 71. I guess Ill just go kill myself 
@_date: 2016-03-21 17:57:18
Now their website is down. When you go to it it tries to download something. What in the fuck is going on?!?!?!
@_date: 2017-03-20 10:40:18
I'll give it a try
@_date: 2016-01-07 20:18:45
@_date: 2017-03-02 02:24:16
I'm curious too
@_date: 2017-03-11 03:12:45
I'll bring the blow!
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:32:58
Volatility doesn't always lead to growth, it can easily go the other way. Even tho I'm a believer it will only grow.
@_date: 2017-01-20 16:25:31
"Financial super empowerment", how does that work?
@_date: 2017-01-19 23:51:09
@_date: 2017-01-22 23:14:29
I did bitcoin once. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 20:39:12
I am now. I first tried it like 8 months ago. I'm playing around on it right now... there doesn't seem to be a lot for sale her but maybe I'm not using it right. I'm not really liking to GUI
@_date: 2017-01-09 18:01:15
I couldn't figure out how to use openbazaar on my Mac. I'm so confused to how OB works.....
@_date: 2017-01-19 16:02:13
Thanks!! That's what I was looking for. Sure I'll start running a node. 
@_date: 2019-03-23 17:10:40
Maybe, it doesn’t 
@_date: 2017-01-06 22:01:28
@_date: 2017-01-09 21:54:53
I'm not looking for fancy. I find the search function doesn't yield a lot of results but maybe there isn't a lot on there or I'm not doing it right.
@_date: 2017-01-06 22:02:32
I signed up for bitpay
@_date: 2017-01-19 15:50:12
I'm asking seriously. Why would I pay for my electricity to do this? How does it help? What does it do?
@_date: 2017-01-10 11:33:09
Interesting. I wonder what the future holds for this, and how I capitalize off it
@_date: 2017-01-19 13:04:03
I don't think so. I have a bunch of shit I want to sell too for Bitcoin and am having problems finding places to do so
@_date: 2017-01-07 02:18:48
@_date: 2017-01-19 13:31:18
Why would I do this?
@_date: 2017-01-19 13:30:21
Do you offer a daily email updates that I can pay a monthly subscription for?
@_date: 2017-01-13 13:49:40
To release your funds just send 2btc to....
@_date: 2017-01-08 01:13:51
Can someone ELI5 this to me
@_date: 2017-08-21 01:15:08
Why are you afraid?
@_date: 2017-01-06 22:07:48
I have Coinbase too. But using Bitpay at my business. I'm pretty excited, even though I doubt I'll get any payments. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 18:56:23
Well the beta froze on my Mac and I jut deleted it. So basically I put zero effort into it. I'll try it again
@_date: 2017-01-15 01:46:53
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:22:15
I'm excited to be a part of the future. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 14:30:18
Really. That's fucked. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 23:41:33
Oh that a lot better. So it's not really a website...it's more like torrent websites? This is interesting.
@_date: 2016-12-08 01:47:41
You never go full retard
@_date: 2016-12-07 12:21:21
What happened to Coinbase?
@_date: 2019-10-25 22:24:24
You say strategy, I say potato
@_date: 2016-02-27 12:39:13
What's that?
@_date: 2017-09-08 11:22:40
Someone find some quotes from this old buzzard about the Internet. He is too old to truly understand the implications of blockchain and crypto. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:13:31
I could eat a sandwich 
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:13:31
I could eat a sandwich 
@_date: 2016-10-15 15:17:35

@_date: 2017-07-21 22:29:46
Big if true 
@_date: 2017-07-22 00:03:25
I sent .25BTc!! Yeah welcome to crypto! 
@_date: 2017-06-01 00:46:24
Can't find any miners for sale 
@_date: 2017-06-21 01:40:13
Fuck Coinbase
@_date: 2017-06-04 22:31:22
Bull trap?
@_date: 2017-06-21 13:56:59
I blame your mom 
@_date: 2017-06-17 19:01:08
Why not let the user adjust the change % to receive notifications 
@_date: 2017-06-15 23:42:25
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:27:15
You're simulation stimulated me 
@_date: 2017-06-15 23:00:57
