It’s still in infancy stages...
There are scaling solutions [coming]( that will lower the transaction costs. The fluctuations become smaller the more it’s [used]( and more traditional businesses are beginning to accept [it](

You’re right most of it is chasing profit... however, despite [this]( ) being super biased, facts are facts... the dotcom bubble was $7 trillion vs $0.5T; the market was only US, not global; and the barrier to entry was larger for stocks than it is for crypto.

Agreed, if you’re working with small amounts of money betterment or acorns are good choices. Also, I really like the “found money” feature of acorns, great addition!

Not really. Look for free trades on stocks, free checking with goals (qapital is one I’ve been looking into but had Simple for a few years now), a savings account with the highest interest rate you can find, and several crypto exchanges from around the world to ensure that you’ll always be able to sell when you want. Other than that you can invest in physical gold, which shouldn’t be hard since one of the major world dealers is based there (Perth mint); and see if you can find a good dealer that will offer online buying, vault storage for free up to a certain amount, and custodial insurance (I use Goldmoney, but not sure if they offer service for you).

Sorry, but gotta disagree here. You can start a [Robinhood]( account, a [Goldmoney]( account, an [Ally]( savings, and a [Coinbase]( account. All of these accounts are free to start and have no minimum balance. Over time you’ll have a pretty well diversified portfolio.
And you could throw in a [Simple]( checking account to help you save and manage your money.
Edit: betterment and acorns are both great for stocks (I like Robinhood for the ability to buy individual stocks); 
Also qapital wallet looks interesting - it’s like acorns + simple + ally all in one… aka roundups, goals, and interest on all deposits

Not right away! Put that $10 in betterment, then the next $10 in crypto, then $10 in gold, then $10 in savings. By the time you reach $1000 you’ll have a portfolio where no more than 25% of your money is exposed to any one asset. 
And no one thinks that $10 is actually a savings. That’s what you should save each month. And if that’s all you can manage over years then you need to spend some time in PS don’t take offense! I’m just trying to show that there are ways for the poor to save intelligently without too much risk. Also, someone with less money that wants to take the risk can easily weight their portfolio toward crypto. When you don’t have money the game is all about capital appreciation, and once you have it the game is about capital preservation. 
Three years ago I didn’t have any savings, a crushing amount of student debt, and a ton of credit card debt. As a result I spent the last three years teaching myself about finance, living within my means, and saving every penny I could. This has led to me having almost an entire years salary saved up and a nicely diversified portfolio that should keep me growing for the foreseeable future.

Ha, yeah relatively young, turned 30 this year. And yes you’re absolutely right! [56.3%]( of Americans have less than $1000 to their name. However, I would argue (like the article does) that most were never taught good habits with money and have no idea how to manage it intelligently.
Now, you could absolutely argue that the fact that most people don’t have a savings and live paycheck-to-paycheck is more of an indictment of the failures of our economic system than of individual spending habits, and that is absolutely true. People working minimum wage jobs should be able to make it in the western world, and build a future. (The bootstrap argument is absolutely bullshit).
However, you have to admit that spending a little time educating oneself on how to manage money is probably the best investment to make. We literally trade our time on this planet for money, so I’d say it’s pretty worth while to figure out how to leverage it and make it work for you.

Hmm haven’t come across it yet. Thanks for the suggestion!

How they sell themselves: “Digital gold,” low fees, asic resistant mining, difficulty adjusted every block, 2.5min block times, privacy features, lightning network and segwit for scalability

And it lets us accumulate more coins at better prices. I like to think of the many blow off tops of bitcoin as quick glimpses into its future value

In light of bitcoin transactions being fairly expensive these days and Coinbase adding their own exchange fees I would suggest going to Gdax.com (it’s Coinbase’s exchange) and use your Coinbase login credentials. You can then deposit money into the account and place limit orders and you will not be charged exchange fees.
[No Fees on Coinbase]( 
PS Good digital wallets are Jaxx or exodus. Ledger nano s, keepkey, or trezor are the best cold storage wallets. You can also look into paper wallets if you’re interested in free cold storage.
Welcome to crypto!

It only covers liability on the company’s behalf. If your individual account on either Coinbase or gdax is compromised then you will not be compensated.

However, your fiat is FDIC insured up to $250K; and could not be seized if Coinbase became insolvent.
In addition, storing crypto in any cold storage wallet where your private keys are stored within the encrypted device ensures your coins safety as long as you securely store the 24 word passphrase. In other words if the device was destroyed or lost you (or a family member) could recover the wallet with the code you wrote down (I simply store my piece of paper in a fire/waterproof safe)
And lastly, as for an uninsured digital wallet being compromised, that is entirely possible! And is the reason you should never store a significant amount of money in one. But, your individual Coinbase account is not insured either and as such should not be trusted as secure unless you’re 100% confident that a hacker could never install a keylogger on any of your devices and circumvent two factor auth. 
There is a reason Coinbase stores 98% of its customer’s coins in cold storage...

I prefer to do as the pros do, and trust no one... 
Also this is the beauty of crypto! YOU own and control the funds instead of being forced to trust a third party

Sooo how exactly do you think the GLD ETF works? It’s a trust that holds the physical equivalent necessary to back the ETF they are selling. This is exactly how a bitcoin ETF would work... so no, ETF’s do not only exist for baskets of companies.
