Just make sure the place accepts Bitcoins before you go, OP.

This is my buy signal. Thanks guys.

I dunno. I don't buy it. What kind of interest rates are you paying on the CC? What sort of monthly min payments? Just buying and holding, or actively trading? It just seems like such an insanely crazy idea, and this is reddit afterall, so I just assume you are makin' shit up. If not... well.... godspeed I guess....

You didn't actually, right? You are just saying words on the internet, right?

Agreed. However, it's not a bad idea to be skeptical of this mentality as well. There will always be smart people selling to people with this mentality at the top of the bubble. People were selling $1000 coins a year ago and making an absolute killing preying on those thinking they were making a 'great investment' with 'enormous growth potential'. Nobody bought $1000 coins thinking they'd be worth 1/3 of that a year later. Maybe we'll see $1000 again. Maybe not. All the hope in the world won't guarantee us anything. As revolutionary as BTC may be, it's still a zero sum game where many many people will get completely hosed on their investment.


That's debatable. You can buy bitcoin with a Visa in less than 5 minutes on Circle (and it's insured). Numerous online retailers accept bitcoin, and there are a handful of global exchanges and national exchanges in many countries around the world. I think it's time we move past the narrative that this is still the early adoption phase of bitcoin. Early adoption was going to the bank and wiring cash to some random bank account and hoping to all hell that it'll show up in your MtGox account in the next few days.

Not in Canada they don't. You're lucky.

People can buy BTC with their credit card in 5 minutes on Circle. How much easier does it need to be for new people to enter the market? Lack of interest is the bottleneck.

That's a bit of on an understatement.

If you invested before 2013, sure. Nobody in 2014 would say that, not that there are enough new investors to keep the price up anyway.

Nope. Most people can't out perform the stock market in general, let alone pick one  winning stock after another. Warren Buffet isn't most people, and its arrogant and ridiculous to assume you have the skill that he has. By all means look up to him, but unless you have a proven track record like he does, maybe don't latch on to his quotes like he's some sort of Messiah that you must follow.


That is a horrible investment strategy that will ultimately end in failure. ie: Blowing up your entire retirement savings, if you ever even save anything to begin with.


You have that completely wrong. You are thinking of trading. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose in your trading account, because you will lose it for sure. But do you think that advice works for people's retirement savings? Most people are investing that money in mutual funds, s&amp;p, a variety of stocks, etc, and none of them can afford to lose it.

You know, somebody has to pay the professors and heat and clean those big lecture halls. It isn't free.

You mean Reddit isn't all super intellectual STEM graduates? I feel like I've been lied to this whole time. /s
