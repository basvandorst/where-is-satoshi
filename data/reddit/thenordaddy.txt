Yeah I understand, I just bought one due the wallet I was using potentially going the 2x path and I've been told that would mean I was going to lose my coins. So I figured I'd upgrade my security to be safe.

Wait, what's this about? I use exodus, if they switch how will that affect my bitcoin?

I'm fairly new to bitcoin, if you could provide details later I'd like to read up on anything interesting

I think he meant rising in general and not this particular bump

So this isn't like the previous fork where, to my understanding, you received and kept both you BTC and BTH?

If you're making the claim you need to provide proof to support said claim, why do you believe china caused it?

I've heard other people speculating it's because people are transfer alt coins into bitcoin in preparation for the fork to pick up the forked coin.  The reasoning for it was because the Alts were dropping in price while bitcoin was rising. 
Idk if that's true, but it makes enough sense to me.

Yes you can buy fractions of a bitcoin and then it'll grow or shrink with the market.
Bitcoin has value because people see value in it, simple as that.  No different than the US dollar or gold, people value it because other people do.  In this particular instance, people value bitcoin because of the things it offers as a currency.  Untrackable, decentralized, transferable to anywhere in the world with minimal fees and any other number of characteristics about the tech or principles behind bitcoin.
There's a documentary on Netflix that serves as a decent explanation as to how it works and why some people believe we need it.  It's titled banking on bitcoin or something similar.

As I understand it, generally with forks there is something called replay protection that gives you both coins (if you have 1 bitcoin, you receive 1 fork coin, be it bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold, bitcoin classic or whatever the flavor of the month is).  So, if a fork has replay protection, people will trade their alt coins (be it litecoin, ethereum, or whatever they have) for bitcoin in order to maximize the number of bitcoin they have before it forks in order to maximize how many fork coins they receive for free.  Most then dump their fork coins and buy more of whatever coin they're actually interested in.
One concern about the upcoming 2x fork is that it has no replay protection and if you're holding your bitcoin somewhere insecure you may lose them for the 2x coin, which appears to be priced considerably lower than bitcoin. Meaning you'll lose a lot of money.
Probably, maybe, idk, I'm new here
