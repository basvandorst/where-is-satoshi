Geez...20 years.   To answer your question, yes...nobody can touch your bitcoins ever unless they have the private key.  This is the problem though....where are you going to store your private key?  and 20 years is a long long time.  I don't even remember my address 20 years ago...I can't imagine hiding my private keys somewhere and hoping to find them 20 years from now.  And remembering a passphrase?  Yikes...Yeah, you'll probably have to write it down, but then you open yourself up to someone finding it and getting your coins.   You can't store it in a safety deposit box either because after a few years banks will clear it out if they havent heard from you.
You might want to think about pulling a Michael Schofield and having your private key/passphrase tattoo'd secretly on your body somewhere in a way that only you can read it.

This is the exact same exclusivity argument people who go to community college say about people that go to Harvard.

As someone who did the exact same thing and freaked out too, I can confirm...the bitcoins will be there when your wallet finally syncs.

Baseline is what I use.  Its free, but you can only track 5 addresses at the same time unless you upgrade....good news is you can erase those addresses though and never have to upgrade.

I don't know if someone addressed this, but hte transaction do not take longer than credit cards in my experience.  First thing I bought with bitcoin was Malwarebytes.  Transaction was instant.  The only time I have had to wait for confirmations was when buying them from coinbase or putting them on a crypto exchange(or when receiving bitcoin)  I've never had to wait for confirmations when buying something digital online whether a program or a game or something.
As far as the other cons...if someone stole your payment...You'd sue.  
Vulnerable to scams/wallet stealing?  Much easier to steal your credit card than your bitcoins.
And for the last one...Bitcoin is deflationary.  Right now, its a pretty good chance if you hold bitcoin, it will go up in value.  After we stabilize, the dollar will continue to go down in value as bitcoin continues to go up, just due to dollar inflation.  Bitcoin is basically where you want to keep your money when you don't want to put cash under your mattress or put it in a bank earning .01% interest.
