Did you ever see their Twitter feed?  It was overrun with automated "Dear Customer" messages.  They had some bot or something run wild replying to everyone with an excerpt from an email template.  The messages stopped in early January and there had been no tweets since.  Someone probably finally decided to clean up the mess and using a third-party tool to delete everything is faster than going through the hundreds or thousands of tweets and deleting them manually.  Also, a poster above said that they could have deleted tweets because of people trying to manipulate the market by linking to old tweets that said things along the lines of "Transfers resuming Monday" or something like that.  That's a pretty good reason IMO.  
@_date: 2014-01-25 10:50:13

Negative news is sadly more profitable.  People seem to love to be angry at something.  Bitcoin is a real global currency (I live in Japan, but have a US bank account...Bitcoin has made my life so much easier and saved me a ton in international transfer fees) and I think we're long overdue for this.  If not Bitcoin, them some other cryptocurrency.  It just makes a lot more sense.  For the record, it's not just Bitcoin I'm cheering for, but a true decentralized currency with a public ledger that would be globally recognized.  If it ends up being Bitcoin or Dogecoin, I don't really care.  People should look past their nationalism and be behind the idea.

I think the routing part of it would be huge hurdle to overcome seeing as how phones move around constantly or shut off due to the battery dying or for any number of other reasons.  I feel a good chunk of available bandwidth would be used up just trying to keep track of how to send data around...and then what if a node moves out of range or is shut off while an image is being uploaded somewhere or something?  You'd have a massive delay while a new route is found.  
If I had to design a system like this, I'd probably come up with some sort of addressing scheme based on GPS coordinates so routes can be calculated based on geographic location easily.  Maybe something like have small "cells" (a few city blocks maybe) where your phone will keep a table of everyone in your cell, but if you want to reach outside of the cell, the route could be calculated by analyzing the destination address against your current location.  Device addresses would have to be updated often as they move around so a dynamic DNS system would have to be used too.  The more I think about it, the more complicated it gets.  And that's not even taking in to account battery life.  Now that I'm interested, I'm going to have to read up on how it's already been implemented in the real world and how others are proposing to move forward.

Most of their tweets were from an automated bot that was probably left unattended.  Their tweets looked like an excerpt from an email template which couldn't even fit as a whole tweet.  Someone probably finally noticed and decided it was much easier to just use some third-party tool to delete all their tweets rather than go through hundreds (thousands?) and delete all but the few valid ones manually.  I'm no Gox apologist (I'm pretty pissed my domestic yen withdrawal hasn't arrived yet and it's been a month), but I highly doubt there's anything dubious going on with the deletion of their tweets.  A tweet from Gox explaining this would help a lot, but we all know how they are with communication.
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:56:42
Your coins may or may not be gone.  Rumors and fear mongering are running rampant.  I just received a domestic yen transfer from Mt Gox this morning (a few hours before their site went down) so it's not totally dead.  It could be that they are just switching over to a new system.  If they were going to run off with people's coins, I don't think Mark Karpeles would still be hanging out on IRC (although he doesn't respond to anything, his client does become active occasionally.  he probably was advised by lawyers not to say anything at all).

Oh, ouch!  I live in Japan and just got a thing in the mail from some Tokyo court about MtGox's bankruptcy and some info filing a claim.  My wife called me at work freaking out because something from a court was addressed to me and thought I was in trouble (my 5 year old son though I was going to jail).  I never kept much in MtGox, but I did try to withdraw everything to my Japanese bank account in January because people were saying yen transfers were not being delayed.  They were wrong.  It took a month and I got my money on the morning they shut their site down.  I hope you are able to get at least some of the value of your bitcoin back.
Now that more places are accepting bitcoin, I've actually been using it quite a bit lately.  I pay for my server with BTC at ChunkHost and I can buy gift cards and time cards with my BTC.  Humble Bundle accepts BTC which is great and you can buy Reddit Gold with it which I've done for people a couple times now (I wouldn't have done it otherwise).

I've been with Chunkhost for a while now and I've had no problems although I did like Linode better (more datacenter options and better hardware).

I'm pretty much liable to buy anything while drunk.  After enough drinks, I could see myself stumbling over to the ATM to drunkenly show some people how it works.

Why on earth would you have money you depend on in an exchange?
Edit:  Just saw your post history...  How could you possibly have trusted Mt Gox after all the shit they've put people through month after month?  I get that they are the only exchange that does JPY transfers (I'm in Japan so that's a big deal for me), but the warnings have been there for a while now.  When I tried to get my yen out last month and noticed it was getting delayed for weeks (it finally hit my bank yesterday before they shut down their site), I knew Mt Gox was not to be trusted with any substantial amount of money.  It sucks that you lost a lot of money, but the fault is yours for blindly trusting Mt Gox despite everyone's warnings.  I'm pretty confident you'll get your coins back eventually though.

Those ATMs were probably designed and built years ago.  Just because it's technically still supported doesn't mean you should be building new systems with it.

If I had the money, I'd buy it.  Whoever buys it will get tons of free PR and if they handle it right (ie: bringing in a new team of competent engineers and kicking Karpeles to the curb.  If the buyer has been around for a while and has a good reputation, even better), many people would give them a second chance.  Considering they are the only exchange that does domestic JPY transfers and I live in Japan, I'd give them a second chance.  No other exchanges want anything to do with me.

`siege -c 100  is enough to bring it down for using too many resources.  Siege will give up when it goes down (only takes a few seconds), but just put it in a `while true` loop and it'll start over automatically.
Edit:  I just ran this for about 10 minutes and it seemed to break the bitcoin address generating function and it says the price of 1 BTC is $60 (I'm guessing it failed to look up the price so set it to 0 and then added $60 to that).    The saveme.php page now lists 3 warnings probably related to address generation.
Edit 2:  It claims 1BTC = $60, but when I enter 1 BTC to withdraw, it says I will receive $30.  Hilarious lol.
Edit 3:  The price has been fixed, but address generation is still broken.  It seems that the amount it says you will receive automatically has $30 subtracted from it for some reason (ie:  Entering 1 BTC is always $30 less than the price listen on the main page)

Cost of living here in Okinawa is fairly low and Japan actually pays you to have kids so the financial burden isn't so bad.  Japan has a dangerously low birth rate and they will have a really bad population crisis on their hands if they don't do something about it so they basically pay people to have kids right now.  The birth is pretty much fully covered (and if it's cheaper than what the government pays out, the hospital actually gives you the change.  We walked out of the hospital with about $300 extra when my daughter was born), doctor visits for the first few years are pretty much free, and you get a couple hundred bucks every few months for each kid until they are 11 years old.  Once the new baby is born, my wife will start working again and things won't be so tight.  We wanted a third one though and we were running out of time to do it. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 10:48:29
I submitted a ticket days ago with a simple question.  How long do I need to wait for my Japanese bank account to get verified so I can finally make a withdrawal?  I waited over a month for my account to get verified and so now all I want to do is a domestic Japanese transfer.  This was like 4 or 5 days ago and there has been no response.  You guys *still* have the notice about slow transfers due to holidays on your site.  I get the impression that Mt Gox is abandoned.

I strongly disagree with his stance on that.  Vaccination should absolutely be mandatory because it's not something that affects only you.  Some unvaccinated kid unknowingly carrying polio in to the hospital where my newborn son is?  No thank you!  A wilfully ignorant parent should not be able to prevent their child from getting important vaccines.  In my opinion, refusing to vaccinate is borderline criminally negligent just as relying on prayer to cure potentially fatal illnesses.

Yep, in fact, they made it even easier to deposit money (in Japan at least) right before all this went down.  I had been waiting over a week at the time for a small JPY domestic transfer to hit my bank when I got that email so I replied to it and said that under no circumstance would I ever deposit money with them as they have burned all trust I had and have avoided providing any clarity about their situation.  The email was a bit longer than that and I was polite, but that's the gist of it.  They replied with just "You're comment has been forwarded to an appropriate person" or something like that.  I had suspected that the reason it was taking so long to get my domestic transfer (which I had heard here on Reddit was supposed to be working fine) was because they were out of money and relying on new deposits to fund the backlog of withdrawals.  It eventually took 1 month to get my money and they deposited it the morning they shut down the other day.

I've never felt comfortable storing the salt in the database.  I know it's probably fine, but something about it just rubs me the wrong way and I can't put my finger on it.  I usually use other columns in the row for the salt.  Something like account creation date (or last password change date) plus the username for example.  I feel like it would be much more difficult for an attacker if they have no idea what the salt is or even if they are salted.

I could see my mom trying to type in a bitcoin address to send money to and not capitalizing anything and her money just vanishing.  QR codes are convenient, but they are not always available.  Some sort of decentralized DNS-like system for bitcoin addresses would help a lot (like actual domains, not just username aliases.

You are preaching to the choir here.  This is _not_ simple for most people.  My grandma can write and send me a check today.  You think she's going to be able to figure out WTF bitcoin is, how an exchange works, how to secure her BTC, and then how to send it as quickly as she could just write a check and drop it in the mailbox (or take a picture of it and email it to me so I can cash it immediately online)?  Hell, a lot of people still think this is a pyramid scheme.  Yes, for those of us who have been using it for a while and are set up with exchanges and stuff, it's super simple.  It's my preferred method of payment and transferring money between my US and Japanese banks.  The barrier to entry and learning curve is too steep for any of my parents or grandparents though thus making this not so simple for others.

Like I said, QR codes aren't available everywhere and copy/paste isn't going to work between devices.  Fact is, bitcoin addresses aren't user friendly for most people (we are not most people).  QR codes are a bandaid solution, but there's been numerous times where I've had to manually type in an address on my phone in order to send bitcoin because there was no QR code.  And if I'm a business accepting money, what sort of privacy should I be expecting?  I never said anything about these aliases being permanent.  The alias could cycle through 500 pre-generated addresses for all I care or whatever.  I just want people to have an easy, memorable, way to send me money and vice versa.

Rakuten in Japan is complicated.  They already back an NFC payment system called Edy that is tied in to their point system on the site.

On residential connections, it kind of makes sense to restrict port 25 and such.  There are a lot of computer illiterate people out there with compromised machines attempting to send spam 24/7.  For people who want to run their own mail server, it would probably make more sense and be more economical to just get a cheap VPS (which is what I do, although I still use Gmail as my primary mail).  Set up your SPF record correctly and ensure your IP isn't on a blacklist due to it being assigned to a douchebag previously (it's annoying, but not that difficult to get removed from blacklists) and you're good to go.  
That said though, I am not comfortable with ISPs blocking ports or whatever, but I do see restricting SMTP ports on residential connections as benefiting the internet as a whole.  That's probably the only compromise I'm willing to make when it comes to net neutrality though.

I live in Japan and employed by a Japanese company.  The US has no jurisdiction to garnish my wages here despite me being American.  I would still owe the US whatever money they claim, but they can't force a foreign employer to hand that money over.  Like said, it doesn't matter if it's BTC or dollars.

If I was to get my grandma in to Bitcoin, there's no way I would trust her with maintaining her own wallet.  I could easily see her trading in her current phone for a new one, downloading a wallet app, and then wondering where all her money went because she didn't understand the concept of private/public keys.  I'd point her to Coinbase or another reputable service.  Maybe some day this will become common sense, but it's not today.  I imagine my grandma probably wouldn't have trusted her grandma with a credit card.  Give Bitcoin (or cyrptocurrency in general) a generation or so to become mainstream and we'll see some big changes.

Yep.  Most of us here on reddit are fairly computer savvy and know how to protect ourselves.  I have no doubt though that my grandma's computer is probably trying to send out spam at this very moment and there is no way she'd be able to run her own mail server.  Unfortunately, us computer savvy people are far outnumbered by people who think the blue "e" on their desktop is the internet.

If you need help testing in Japan with a Japanese credit card, shoot me a message.

Ah yeah, you're right.  I just got so used to using SSL by default these days that I forgot that 587 could be unencrypted as well.

Port 25 is the one that's generally blocked.  Port 587 much less so (although you'll need to implement SSL).  At least, that's the case here in Japan.  Most ISPs here blocked outgoing 25 on ADSL connections first and then blocked it on fiber a year or so later, but they specifically left 587 open as an alternative for those who truly needed it.  That block only applied to residential connections; business connections were unaffected as it is assumed they have half a brain.

I'd buy them if it wasn't such a pain in the ass...I'm currently waiting to get my bank account approved, but I've had so many hoops to jump through it's been ridiculous.  One place supposedly had instant verification, but I was still denied because my bank account doesn't have enough activity.  Another place flat out refuses to do business with me because I'm an American (doesn't matter that I live in Japan).  And then there's all these shady intermediaries to move my money between each taking a fee.  This needs to be much simpler.
