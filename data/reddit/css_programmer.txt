It's an iterative loop that began with it's creation and ends when it fills the entire void of the universe.

Thank you very much! Don't let anyone tell you arguing with shills is useless! They have a personal stake in things and smashing that button will get them to fork over every time!

Communism is a cashless society and Bitcoin is a form of cash so no.

How about a link to the documentation?

Good to know.

I'm looking for non partisan advice thanks!

What if you copy paste the wrong one?

The free market is not a zero sum game.
80% of a companies productivity comes from 20% of the people. When these productive 20% accumulate more wealth then more things get produced in society and you get a runaway effect where you can work at mcdonalds with no skills right out of high school and still have a better life than the greatest kings 200 years ago.
Also of note is that happiness is a flatline across all income ranges and not a bellcurve, meaning people are pretty happy with things being unequal.

You mistype one letter and all those bitcoins are lost forever!

This is how all government granted monopolies work. Including government.

Oh, thanks. I was actually hoping someone would point out a cheaper way to do this.

It's not zero sum actually because there are plenty of reasons to buy and sell bitcoin. That's why it is worth what it is now. If bitcoin were pieces of paper then it would cost about $1 for 120 of them, and even then you could write on it or burn it so therefore paying for it isn't a loss.

IKR lol!
@_date: 2018-11-26 15:13:30
ok thanks.

Why bet it? There's place to short it right? (I am asking this legitimately)
@_date: 2019-01-12 15:02:19
Doubt it. 
I seen 'em kicking over trash cans. They're hardcore socialists.
@_date: 2018-12-04 20:38:40
Jokes aside, you should probably stop talking to them if they are going to be like that about things. I wonder what they are trying to make up for by kicking people when they're down.

Is this real?
