Sure, changes in regulations can cause predictable jumps, but if it's that easy then surely you could answer your own question? 
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:15:22
No one knows!

Sure, but with a capped supply won't the price match that market cap?

~25% if he bought at the top

I mean, based on the post, 100k was probably a fraction of his portfolio. Doesn't say he went all in.

Engineering I hope

I called $11,500 top and sold most. Oops! 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:51:48
Well it didn't go under 9k, but it was under 11,000 for a short bit. These people are probably buying on an exchange.

I don't think you could afford body guards

I apologize, I don't understand your message.

When it reaches its lowest local minimum value! 
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:24:32
Just wait. (:
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:36:55
It will come 
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:52:36
Or $0!

Bitcoin has been going up. Fast. Today it was up over $300. It's unlikely that growth of that magnitude is stable, and bitcoins may be a bit overvalued at this time. As such, the price may undergo a correction, closer to its true value. Bitcoin may drop down to $2,000 tomorrow, maybe it will only drop to $3,500 over the next month. Maybe it will just keep heading for the moon! No one knows, but best of luck.

It was up so much so fast. I think the dip is still coming. c:

I think you got it backwards, pal 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:56:46
 Oheck, went over my head, thanks!

Okay. Shameless meme copying

Invest in what China bans, in other news poorly repeated memes are classic
