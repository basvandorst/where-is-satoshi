Captain Obvious says "Massively flawed cryptocurrency will never replace the dollar", news at 11.

Inability to easily use it as a payment for normal goods is the largest one. The fact that all of the buisnesses built up around it keep getting hacked and that the initial versions of the client didn't have encryption built in (and to my understanding the encryption in the newer clients is flawed anyways). Transfer speeds are slow.
I do find bitcoin interesting and exciting and hope it goes places, but it has far too many problems to ever replace the dollar. Anyone who thinks that such a thing is possible is delusional.

This right here is the greatest barrier to entry for people to get into bit coin. This is far too complicated for the average user.

This is the definition of too good to be true

A lot of people here lost a lot more than 500 dollars. Consider it a learning experience.

Has the EFF not taking an official stand on bitcoin yet? I can imagine why they might not want to back it what with all of the negative publicity it's been getting. If I were them I would be waiting for the bugs to be ironed out of the system as it were before I backed it publicly.

Lesson to take away from this: If it sounds too good to be true it probably is.
If it's promising 3300% interest rates, IT DEFINITELY IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE.

*beep* the price is going down down down.

Yeah I was going to say, I feel like people here are protesting in the hopes that our social support system will become more like canada. What do the canadians have to complain about.

Early adopters who got in while mining was still easy and sold out when the price was ridiculously high. Also the numerous scammers selling ponzi schemes to 16-20 year old kids who are too young to recognize them.

I disagree, this clearly belongs in SURRENDER SHEPARD

As much as I hate to say it I think you are right.

Are you open source?

Only if they could do it without being detected or if they somehow could gain from destroying bitcoin. If people knew the system was compromised it would cause a mass sell off and the currency would crash to worthless or near worthless levels.

A 51% attack on the entire network would kill bitcoin instantly. As discussed in a previous thread the estimated cost to wage such an attack would be about 14 million dollars. Not that expensive if someone really wanted to take it out.
@_date: 2011-10-27 20:04:34
This is exactly the sort of thinking that lost thousands of people their life savings when the price bubble happened.
Understand that bitcoin does have inherit utility but the idea that it could replace or rival the USD is pure fantasy.
@_date: 2011-10-18 02:16:57
This is an excellent post, thank you. Supposing bitcoin at this point is doomed, would you endorse any other cryptocurrency to take it's place? I have heard of encoin being a possible replacement with its value tied to the price of a kilowatt hour to provide stability, but I know there are other interesting ideas too.
@_date: 2011-10-08 22:17:45
Except that bitcoin was structured in such a way that massive price inflation was inevitable. They didn't have to build it that way, but they did.
@_date: 2011-09-23 22:44:39
Well yes, but that much is out of our hands. Truecrypt wouldn't protect you against a keylogger either.

Replace it with a superior crypto foot. Warning: Crypto foot may rapidly decay down to nothing in a few days time. 
@_date: 2011-10-09 09:51:36
My problem is that bitcoin is going to fundamentally undermine the idea of cryptocurrencies once it inevitably fails due to its poor implementation and batshit insane user base. Understand that I had high hopes for this currency and I would like nothing more than to see it recover and stabilize. Unfortunately I think we are just 1 or 2 huge sell offs away from the entire currency collapsing. 
@_date: 2011-10-08 00:19:00
Is there a way to short bitcoins because at this point i think you are pretty much guarenteed to make a killing.
@_date: 2011-10-11 08:25:09
Good point!
@_date: 2011-11-24 21:43:51
Uh no, it would absolutely not be legal. Are you fucking kidding me? Just because you are paying them in pretend internet money doesn't mean you aren't paying them at all.
@_date: 2011-12-21 03:42:23
This is officially the stupidest thing I have ever read on the internet. Well done.
@_date: 2011-09-24 20:02:09
These are excellent ideas.

Two worthless currencies for the price of one!

Its down just like the price! Zing!

This is definitely in no way shape or form a scam!
@_date: 2011-11-25 00:10:06
That may be true, but it's completely separated from the point I was making, which is that the cops aren't going to not arrest you just because you used bitcoins as payment instead of real money.
@_date: 2011-10-28 08:46:08
They have online currency experts now?

Mt. Gox is currently arguing in french court that bitcoin does not constitute a currency actually, so I think I will wait to see what the courts think. But you are right, I was being unnecessarily derisive there by calling it "pretend internet money." Just because it is a horribly designed crypto currency which can't keep a stable value doesn't mean it is necessarily not real. Just like how world of warcraft gold has real value. Even though it represents nothing and cannot be used to buy goods or services in the real world (just like bitcoin).
So for that, I apologize.

Something about needing evidence to back accusations being stupid and that he was willing to form an opinion without any. I wish I had print screened it because the wording was incredible as far as conveying the point that the poster was completely retarded.
@_date: 2011-11-24 22:40:49
Pretty sure it doesn't work that way. Otherwise everyone would just pay prostitutes in gold coins to evade the law.
@_date: 2011-09-19 09:16:55
But the faith in the currency would be forever shattered.

Seeing as I never said the first thing, I suppose I probably meant the second.

The payment system is valuble, the fact that people are trying to use it as an investment scheme is damning the currency and making a few people very very rich.
