When fees have crippled the main chain and made 55% of addresses unspendable, the vision is lost, and the choice is clear to me. 
People who really needed Bitcoin (eg. in Venezuela or Zimbabwe) are now royally fucked unless they can get their BTC into BCH.
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:52:21
This doesn't make any sense. The peer to peer sense comes from sending your Bitcoin from one user to another. Non-mining nodes were never even supposed to exist. Lightning network will involve jumping around hubs to make transactions and that is defintely not peer to peer when hubs will likely be banks or other wealthy parties.

Nobody knows because nobody has tried. Core has refused to try, and their investors fear that it can scale.

The bank is holding your money the whole time... So no. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 14:33:05
Please tell me how sending BTC without a node means I'm not even using Bitcoin.
Please tell me how non-mining nodes contribute to the security of the network.

You're confusing a hard fork with a chain split. BCH is a chain split with strong replay protection though.

When you send a transaction, you are sending data on the network.
@_date: 2018-01-04 06:31:02
Can you source this for me? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:05:59
Back in my day hard forks were an upgrade, not an attack. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:05:25
You can't say people don't run nodes because of the long sync time. People don't run nodes because there's no incentive to do so. 
The only people who directly benefit from running non-mining nodes are merchants who will use the node for rapid fraud detection (and miners obviously.) Non-mining nodes contribute nothing meaningful for the average user and nothing meaningful to the network. 
Also if people stopped running nodes on raspberry pi then the long sync time would be eliminated. There are currently too many non-mining micrinodes with poor internet connectivity that slow down how quickly the full blockchain can be relayed to another node.
I'm sure you're well aware non-mining nodes don't contribute to decentralization because without hash power they get no say on the network.
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:52:17
This is incorrect. I would suggest you reread the whitepaper. Nodes are defined as mining nodes. A non-mining node contributes nothing to the network.
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:07:23
This is false, block size limit was brought down to prevent bloat attacks while BTC was still worthless. Once BTC had any value at all over $1, the fees for the bloat attack would make it nonviable. Bitcoin Cash is not able to be spammed, as large blocks chew the spam transactions very quickly.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:37:01
The technology isn't there. Lightning will barely get adopted. Hard forks are the only way to properly upgrade.
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:56:45
So in the future when BTC is worth millions per coin, it can only be used by the rich unless you get the rich to agree to hard fork with you. Genius!
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:50:56
Bitcoin is no longer a currency, the developers have pushed it towards a store of value. You'll have no delays and no fees using bch.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:06:22
some mining pools reject 0 fee transactions due to a bug at the moment but 1sat/byte always clears in 10 minutes for me and comes out to like $0.005 in fees. this makes microtransactions and business operations possible on the bitcoin cash blockchain. i would highly recommend that as your coin of choice for your business.
as for converting the BCH to £, i do not know. I live in the US and look forward to coinbase adding BCH support in January.
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:05:18
you'd be best off switching to a peer to peer cash coin, you'll pay much less in fees.
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:19:55
Running a non-mining node offers very little benefit to the decentralization of Bitcoin. You could put 10k more nodes online tomorrow and if miners decide to rewrite the blockchain those nodes won't do shit.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:42:01
Funny that Satoshi Nakamoto is still holding his Bitcoin Cash though.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:02:03
Because a store of value works a lot better when it doesn't crumble away to fees if you try to move it. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:39:44
You're exaggerating a good bit here. Satoshi said 130mb blocks could match Visa, and BCH testnet confirmed the majority of nodes will have no problem increasing block size all the way up to 1GB, which we are years away from needing. The important part is that businesses who have built ecosystems on Bitcoin need low fees no matter what and BTC merchant adoption is dwindling.

This is not an example of an opposition view being censored.
This is an example of abuse. You're just calling people names. Whereas, in this subreddit, people could be banned for saying they like BCH.
If this comment gets me banned, it kind of proves my point.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:48:42
There should be no need to cash out. That's the problem with BTC now. It's only a means to get more fiat from the next sucker. It was supposed to unify the world with a single global peer to peer currency. There was no cashing out. Enter BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:05:48
 actually, if fees bother them then they will switch to coins without fees, not a different address version of the same coin with slightly cheaper fees
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:11:47
What it sounds like you're saying is the only ones with the capital to run the LN hubs will be banks... I thought bitcoin was supposed to bank the unbanked and do away with bankers and third parties handling my money..?

Nothing in common? They share the same genesis block and the ledgers are identical up until August 2017.

He wasn't trying to trade. He was ordered by law to sell the assets.
Those coins were worth $400 each at the time of bankruptcy so...
10k sounds phenomenal to me.

Won't atomic swaps introduce inflation in a way and force price down over time?
Two coins like BTC and LTC being atomic swapped over lightning network would make way more coins on lightning, and lightning is the only way forward. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:17:53
People have been trying to build that for years. There's been a big road block at 1MB blocks for some reason.
Thankfully, there's BCH.
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:14:25
For everyone else, Bitcoin Cash is ready now. May upgrade giving us 16x the capacity of on-chain BTC.

Why does the collapse of the dollar put someone out of business when they have decades worth of infrastructure in place? They just start accepting pesos and move on.

The Mt. Gox hack happened months after this video... Roger was talking about an unrelated withdrawl issue in this video.. and he was right, everything was fine here.
Check the date on the YouTube vid that Roger himself posted.
