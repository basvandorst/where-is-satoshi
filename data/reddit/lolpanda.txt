In that case I believe its not called an ATM but is instead a Bitcoin reseller.

No Starbucks gift vouchers on gyft :(

Does this ATM dispense cash ? Or only take cash for BTC?

Sorry for being dumb, but what exactly is the author pissed off about?
@_date: 2014-02-11 22:09:42
old timer here
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:48:23
You sound fucking retarded
@_date: 2014-01-26 17:46:06
so why is the volume so high on mtgox today?
@_date: 2014-01-30 20:52:41
do they do starbucks vouchers?

Does this mean it is legal to buy bitcoin on an exchange, convert it to to fiat on the exchange and then back to bitcoin without having to pay tax - so basically I can try and  see if I can buy and sell at the right time to make more bitcoin? (Based in the UK)

how did you filter for 3.5 days? what software did you use? thanks  =]
@_date: 2013-10-22 12:04:41
But as hashing rate increases, does difficulty increase to match - so this graph is accurate?

Its the guy behind satoshi

So until 2140 - Bitcoin is actually an inflationary currency
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:13:26
hahah thanks dude = ) appreciated
@_date: 2013-10-21 11:42:54
Thank you for the great reply, I have built software to buy sell instantly from mtgox, and am now just looking for patterns I can code in, hence my interest. but this is a little too complex for me!
@_date: 2013-10-22 23:45:24
But the article *is* the front page of my blog
@_date: 2013-10-22 23:46:13
He doesnt explain how he made the inflation rate curve though :(
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:58:20
hahahaha sounds like a plan :)
@_date: 2013-10-22 12:51:54
so if the hash rate increased to 5 P/Hashes over night. Would the difficulty adjust to keep a block every 10 minutes occurring?
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:14:41
ahhahahah I laughed
@_date: 2013-10-22 18:19:15
where there any signs before it did?
@_date: 2013-10-23 09:35:52
hmmmm I had not realised this
@_date: 2013-10-22 12:21:38
Does the system keep the block creation rate stable?  So the 4 year estimate will hold no matter how much the difficulty rate increases?
