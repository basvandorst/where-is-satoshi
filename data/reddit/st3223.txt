CTFNOOB is a correct user name. Obviously that will be an important step in MASS adoption. You can clearly read (maybe you can't) the tittle says MASS ADOPTION not a few or a group adoption. An avalanche doesn't start with the whole mountain coming down, something has to trigger that, however small. One of bitcoins triggers will be the adoption of the small but ever growing bitcoin/cryptocurrency community. The more the small community of users grow, so does word of mouth, new technology to help assist in its growth and ease of use. So yes clearly someone has to show up to lay the first brick before a wall is amassed.

World average on fees are 5.5%.
Setting up a hot wallet whilst the atm is connected to an exchange to instantly order the same amount paid out will void volatility risk. 
Yes I have a few great places to place the machine.
If anyone has an answer to my questions tho, that be nice.

What's your thoughts on this. This is a compelling argument, ChangeTip selling user information is completely out of line with a part of the Bitcoin movement.

      This is all on the basis that they already have bitcoins to purchase the girt card with. Also this doesn't solve the problem that if the needs to convert money they have in hand to Bitcoin, they will need an atm. Both of those scenarios can be handled by an one way machine. 
      A two way device which was rightfully not added in to the comparison only strengthens the Bitcoin ATM network. It's only going to grow, imo.

Why doesn't everyone use mycelium wallet? I'm new to Bitcoin (3 months new) but before I invested I read everything I could about how cryptography, cryptocurrancy and Bitcoin worked. The most important information I pulled out of all of this was..... NEVER "bank" with a wallet that has your private keys. Plain and simple. Mycelium has done a great job with this approach and also offer a usb offline cold storage making device. 
The one thing I'm tired of hearing is how ppl are losing their BTC. Many times (not suggesting this particular case) it's user error.

in got this email as well. Strange thing is the email address I use for coinbase is not the one the email went too. I went back through the email address that the fake coinbase letter came to and noticed I've used that address for btcjam, ChangeTip, purse.io. All of these sites I've never been really active on.

I opened my iPad to take out a little bit of coins as I still await an entropy device. I put in the about i want to send, the correct address and then i hit send. 
Nothing happens. Is there an issue with this application? My coins seem to be trapped within this account on this iPad only...... Please help.

No I haven't. I may have signed up with the but it would have been with the same email I used for coinbase. The scammer email did not come to that address. It came to an address that I've gotten weekly email updates from btcjam, changeTip and purse.io
@_date: 2015-04-08 20:29:49
CORRECTION, the email I use for coinbase and bitstamp was also used for localbitcoin. 
BUT the email address I revived the phishing email from was not the same email I used for the 3 sites above. 
The phishing email came to an account I've used for btcjam, purse.io and ChangeTip. All 3 with I'm pretty much dormant on.

Update, I've read the link from below and I was able to restore my coins to my android device. My question to you is, will my backup code i put in be used for this new wallet or is there a new seed that i need to backup too?
