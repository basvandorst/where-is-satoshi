using banksy's work, an artist who commonly attacks advertisement, without permission is kinda fucked btw.

I'll collaborate with you if this actually gets steam.  My team (small 4 person) are located in Barcelona so  it'd have to be all internet...I guess that'd be fitting for a project like this.

tl;dr: dont waste your time with this shit. Bitcoin needs a marketing firm to solve this issue. 
I can't tell if your joking with your post. If you aren't, you must be lying about your background in marketing. There is no quick marketing solution that a reddit forum will solve. If anything, it could cause more damage to Bitcoin with a lack of coordination and core message. Marketing requires research, statistics, analysis, planning and implementations. All of which takes time and money. 
If by some internet miracle you can organize a volunteer marketing firm I'd assume the following right off the bat:
Focus groups would most likely show that people have not heard about bitcoin or conversely those who have heard about it either A) dont understand it or B) relate it to something bad e.g being tied to silk road, poor CNN articles, a documentary called "Rise and Fall of Bitcoin" etc.
So exposure isnt the goal. In my opinion its trust and education. Good luck doing that in a 6 second vine video or with a costly celeb endorsement that doesn't give a shit or understand cryptos.
