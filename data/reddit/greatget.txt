This is exactly when I went all in at the ATH and it dropped to $5,600 right after

So essentially the goal is for everyone to start using Bitcoin and thus remove the need for a 3rd party? Should I just tell my clients to get their own bitcoin wallets ?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:32:49
So will fees be astronomical or will the number of people using bitcoin simply keep them lower?
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:27:13
Guess I'm changing banks

I did this to my dad by showing him my 60% gains over the past month. He only had a chance to call me foolish for about 2 days before getting on board.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:27:36
World War 3 - governments may ban the coin on the grounds that their citizens buying bitcoin only increase the value that foreign enemies may hold. Just a thought. We would have bigger problems at that point tho..
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:41:23
This guy. If you're young .. you have time to make up the loss. I would rather be on my deathbed laughing at something foolish I did when I was younger than regretting not taking a risk like this.

But what if everyone is buying bitcoin for Christmas presents ;)
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:18:13
What if you buy an alt coin like ethereum with bitcoin or vice versa?
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:05:53
I believe you trust me. Yeaaa it sucks I get it
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:23:21
Would my clients have to have bitcoin/exchange accounts? I'd love a way where they pay in USD like they do in PayPal but it converts it to bitcoin automatically 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:11:47
I've been wondering...does Coinbase/GDax process limit/stop orders even if the exchange is having issues? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:44:44
50% profit in 19 days ...and I was worried .. pfffft
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:04:43
Lol yeaaaaa
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:05:00
Is this miners vs. everyone else? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:52:45
I'm not scared, just frustrated that I thought the dust had settled after the fork and the drop happened at like 3am after I hit "buy" at 2am and had been watching minute by minute all night on Gdax. Woke up to quite a surprise.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:27:04
Hold on for dear life 
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:39:02
Because I need to buy more 
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:25:17
I don't understand the logic - are coins being created out of thin air?
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:57:15
I may try to do my max 10k on Coinbase - unless you think it's worth waiting to buy in a potential dip after the fork..
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:11:37
Wait what happened ? I have my money in Coinbase while waiting for my hardware wallet to arrive .. can I not get it out if I want to?
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:11:52
I know but it definitely gives the general public the wrong idea about Bitcoin even though it was good news for us 
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:38:13
True. That is after all the whole purpose of owning Bitcoin - to hold value

Just checked out localbitcoins - is this site legit ? Looks like a craigslist page for bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:46:16
Not for Roth 401k 
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:57:16
I can't even delete the bank account due to a "pending transaction"...I feel like I am stuck and I was about to buy a ton of BTC before the fork 
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:12:39
How long until break even ? Is mining still worth it ?

What's the startup cost and time to breakeven approximately? I need to be able to convince my wife why I need new equipment 
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:14:40
I forgot to mention I changed jobs and now I have a pension plan. I have budgeted to payoff the last $25k of student loans by this summer. I realized 8 years after college that I still owed more than the original principal amount due to delayed interest while in school and some interest rates at 10%. I paid off the first $25k this last year after really tightening up. I feel like Bitcoin is a once in a lifetime opportunity. If not, so be it..I will pay back my 401k loan next year but timing is everything so i need to get in ASAP

You mean "HODL" lol? I just got into this bitcoin craze after my coworker told me he made 7x his money since last year. 10 days later of non stop thinking/researching about bitcoin and I'm going for 17k into it - still a lot to learn so I'm trying 
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:20:45
My Coinbase account says i have a 15k limit on usd Wallet...is this directly linked to my bank account? If so, how long do funds take to process - will I get extra coin in time?
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:34:27
Yeah I had heard of bitcoin a year or two ago but in a negative light (should've looked into it more then). A coworker mentioned it a month ago that he had bought in a year prior and made 10x his investment. I went home and briefly looked it up to see what it actually was..felt like I stumbled on the invention of the internet before it took off. Immediately put the money I could into it when it was at $5800 and within a week I made 25%...then did the rest at $7372. now I live in this Reddit group, Andrea YouTube videos and news articles.
It's amazing how much Reddit can teach you.

Any good guides on this - I want to support bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:33:37
I was able to make a successful purchase a month ago but recently I updated with my drivers license and linked to my bank account with instant verification method - are they saying my bank username doesn't match my legal name...no duh?

Help.. just got this email from Coinbase about my $3k purchase last week 
Hi "______"

So I've contributed 13k and my employer contributed 7k plus 3k in earnings so I just rolled 10k over into an aggressive growth IRA 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:49:14
Scraped up some more to buy in when it hits $5000 to make up my losses 
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:46:40
When did you invest and how much did you buy ?
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:04:11
Thanks. I will update this thread in 2 weeks hopefully with good news 
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:25:08
What do you anticipate happening with the fork on Nov.13th? Wait to purchase or try to get in before or will it make a difference ?
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:21:34
That's what I've been afraid of...the concept of cryptocurrency is revolutionary but enough money can corrupt anything 
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:38:59
My wife has about 27k in her 401k and we have 80k equity in our house because Texas housing market recovery is insane. I also have about $3k in a savings account and save about $1k-$2k per month now that I'm budgeting to payoff the remainder of my student loans.
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:44:36
I verified my account with my ID but when I did that it now says: "the name on your bank account "xxx" does not match the name provided on your Coinbase account "yyyy zzzz". If we do not hear back from you by November 9, we will have to cancel these transactions".
I did the simple username login credentials for my bank account..I have already made one successful purchase prior to verifying my ID..I just don't want to remove and add my bank account again and risk losing the gains when I bought 
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:49:41
This sounds exactly like Craigslist - I always feel like I should bring a gun to these things. I think I will pass since it's 13k
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:04:57
There are other ways to call bitcoin of that scale :

1. Sell house &amp; use profit to payoff student loans and cars (check).
2. Wife's 401k is the emergency fund since we are young (check).
3. I have a pension plan (check).
4. $$$$$$$$ ---&gt; BTC

Hahaha me too. I am folding laundry watching the charts like a hawk and my wife thinks I have a problem 
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:29:01
I bought for 5-10yrs from now minimum. I am hodling as it is digital gold to me. I would never buy a bar of gold, but this..this is something I can buy into.
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:07:38
So sell b2x in like months from now or be watching right around the fork ?
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:50:53
I have hardly seen any "pro-seg2wit" posts. It sounds like it won't get far 
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:10:05
Any other exchanges doubling the amount ? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:48:00
Okay so I can purchase immediately once I receive funds in my bank account through Coinbase? It says I have a 10k limit because I just created my account &lt;2 weeks ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:45:51
So someone tells me I have "X" amount of B2x and it just happens?? Shouldn't mining be a requirement? I withdrew 13k from my Roth 401k on Nov.1st..they said it takes 2 weeks..hoping to get in before the fork. What's the likelihood people are buying in like crazy for free coin and will sell to boost up ethereum?
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:34:37
Name checks out 
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:06:44
I don't think I would ever sell. You only lose when you sell right? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:20:07
It seems like the longer you wait the more likely your b2x becomes worthless or no?
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:26:27
Yes. I should've also heeded the Reddit advice to cost average my way in..I bought with my emotions instead. Reddit knows all. I am sorry Reddit.
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:29:12
Yeah I think 5500 is bottom 
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:23:16
Is mining still profitable for individuals or is it solely for supporting BTC and you don't care about the money?
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:19:18
When it sits still I don't like buying...I either want to feel like I'm jumping on a moving train or feel like I'm finding hidden treasure 
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:30:03
Yeah I should've bought on the downtrend
