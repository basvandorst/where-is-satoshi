So you don't understand the concept of contributory negligence?   I never blame a woman that's been raped, but I also wouldn't tell my daughter that it was okay to get blackout drunk at the frat house.   Let's not wear seatbelts - let's teach people how to drive better!  See how dumb that sounds?

I find many of your assertions (productivity has not gone up?) (9/10th of online time is porn and slander?) to be provably false.

the value is not tied to anything.

That's not what currency backing means, at all.

True, however, those of us that are older also saw the value of the US dollar go down dramatically due to inflation back in the 1970s.  Printing money can make your dollars disappear quickly.
