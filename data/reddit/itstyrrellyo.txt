Its a pretty significant amount, you can see thousands of coins locked in defunct market accounts that may be non retrievable.

If this comic was just the first two panels it would be better

bank transfers are free though?
@_date: 2015-06-18 00:55:34
Er? Greece is a well-educated western country, I dont see why you would think they dont know banksy
@_date: 2014-08-24 17:25:23
this is also something like my insane cousin would post on facebook.
@_date: 2014-09-01 16:52:57
See that's a false comparison. Bitcoin is a currency, and banks are a service. A more accurate comparison would be dollars or euros, which actually hold up quite well in comparison to bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-24 15:02:44
so they can laugh at it?

no, you can't, as the subreddit can be requested if the moderators have been inactive for 30 days

why does japan have different exclamation marks to every other country

They once gave me detention for not taking off my fedora!

Its possible to be interested in something and have a negative opinion of it.
@_date: 2014-11-04 19:33:44
Yeah mate constantly, some of the delusional bullshit you hear on this subreddit is hilarious so I find myself laughing quite a lot. I like the idea of bitcoin but holy shit the community
@_date: 2014-01-29 23:36:21
the only reason I subscribed was because of the amazing "MAGIC INTERNET MONEY" advert

Sit back and wait for it to implode.

Oh fuck off
@_date: 2014-06-08 11:32:51
It does, actually. I frequently see posts like [this]( which I would describe as begging. It's not that everyone is constantly checking % hash, most people see it as easy money. The majority of people would let it hit 50% without noticing. To counter this, you see these posts *begging* people to switch pools.This and the fact that bitcoins are finite with no method of reclamation of permanently lost coins makes it a joke in my eyes.
@_date: 2014-08-20 14:28:20
That's a pretty narrow metric to be comparing retailers on. Amazon have free shipping to my country, Overstock don't. That alone makes Amazon far better for me.
@_date: 2014-08-24 14:22:12
It has that weird linked people thing going on too, you could replace the "middleman" with "illuminati" and it would be one of those facebook posts that your insane cousin posts sometimes.
@_date: 2014-07-08 00:14:51
yeah fwiw our central bank has the advisory capability as a room full of clogged toilets so I wouldn't bother even acknowledging them. After our financial collapse its been pretty clear they have no control of anything anyway.
@_date: 2014-09-18 23:24:30
This is good news for bitcoin

Rush hour on the Piccadilly line about two weeks ago resulted in a platform five people thick waiting for the next train and a level of squeezing that makes this look spacious, and coupled with the incredibly small trains used on the underground made this look very unappealing
I saw that as I was coming down the escalator and just immediately went back up and walked instead
@_date: 2014-03-08 13:12:12
This is probably the most adorable comment I've ever seen
@_date: 2015-01-12 14:28:36
you may have just said "we're not worth trusting". Because you're not. Right now you either have zero income, putting our funds at risk of being lost, or plan on practically stealing, putting our funds at risk of being lost

any time i come up with a good idea someone else already has actually done it :l
i see you kinda pitched it as a wedding ring replacement but i was kinda thinking just for the utility of having the QR for transfers it would be good
@_date: 2015-05-03 17:01:06
it would be sick if you could have this as a ring or something
@_date: 2015-05-25 13:59:54
I had to deal with it a few times when i worked in an electronics shop. maybe one in a hundred card users would have a swipey card (Ireland)
seems like massive bullshit though since its so insecure.

this is the sort of level headed comment we need
@_date: 2016-05-02 12:34:39
dunno, if he doesn't come forward with some proper hard evidence soon, it might be a case that they're trying to lure the real Satoshi into confirming he still exists
@_date: 2015-03-18 01:38:28
all the james bond movies starring daniel craig so far have actually been linked. Obviously Casino Royale continues directly into Quantum of Solace (you can actually watch from the final scene of Casino Royale through the first of Quantum of Solace), andthe secret organisation involved in them is SPECTRE, which is going to be the centre of the next one. Skyfall was mainly just setting up the next movie in that regard with the er, new organisation of MI6

The issue is that Greece has no remaining money and now want to piss off all the people who lend to them by not giving the money back. They're losing money, doesn't matter what currency its in.
