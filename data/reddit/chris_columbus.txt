Simple fact: The US allows exchanges. 
Additional simple fact: If people didn't keep all their bitcoins stored on a random web server, one person, 100 or 100,000 would still have their money. You would never get a bunch of cash and go drop it off at some random person's house and just blindly trust them.  I mean... seriously, anyone who owned more than a single bitcoin and thought it was smart to just blindly trust gox with the storage of their money, then they shouldn't have had a bitcoin in the first place. I have no sympathy for the people saying that had 1000s and 1000s of dollars worth of bitcoin stuck on gox. Why not a cold wallet? Why not a paper wallet? Why not something for your computer like electrum or bitcoin-qt? Why not something on your phone like Bitcoin Wallet? Why just blindly trust a random company called "magic the gathering online exchange?"

Ah yes... because you are just spouting off all sorts of facts.
@_date: 2014-03-14 22:05:04
It appears you did not read the letter. Please try again.
@_date: 2014-03-01 18:57:07
Hmmm, that's interesting... because I never used mt. gox and I'm from the US. Guess that proves that theory wrong. Any other idiotic stuff you want to ramble about?

Sorry - we haven't been able to serve the page you asked for.

It seems more than 1 person doesn't understand you at all, myself included. Would you like to try again but perhaps a more ELI5 response?

First you said there were no options, now you're saying "if there were more options..." make up your mind. You also said the US didn't allow exchanges, which was not true. You keep using that word fact. I don't think it means what you think it means. A fact is something indisputable. You are *speculating* that if more options existed in the US, less people would have lost money on gox... but these alternative exchanges have been around now for a long time. Why didn't these people switch when they became more easily available? The only fact here right now is that you have no idea what you are talking about.
@_date: 2014-03-02 21:03:10
No, my argument was that your argument is flawed. The fact of the matter is, anyone from the US could have purchased bitcoins through a variety of means. 


Does it exist? 


Did it exist?


Can you still buy/sell/store bitcoins on it? 
I've never personally used any of the sites below, but just a quick google search for "US based bitcoin exchange" brought up these results:
- coinmkt.com
- bitquick.co
- coinrnr.com
- coinx.com
- getcoincafe.com
All US based. My point I was getting across is that there was and still is plenty of ways for people to buy/sell bitcoins in the United States. People still chose to use gox. Hell, they still had the option to use any other foreign exchanges. Some have shut down since their launch, however here are 3 more that are available. 
- btc-e.com
- bitstamp.net
- bitsofgold.co.il
I can go on listing different means of bitcoin exchanges, but you aren't worth my time anymore. You can't speculate that if things were different, it would've been better off. If you are going to pull speculation out of your ass, I'll just say that if Bill Clinton didn't get his dick sucked, 9/11 wouldn't have happened. If 9/11 wouldn't have happened, Obama wouldn't be president. As a result of Bill Clinton getting his dick sucked, Obama became president.

But they talk about more than one app in that article... not just the blockchain.info app. They mention Gliph, BitPak, Bitcoin Express and Coinbase. And we know Fancy was just recently asked to remove anything bitcoin. Were they all pulled for the same reason??

You were not only given an attempted answer... you were given a legit solution. The only problem is that you can not grasp the concept. That is why you are getting downvotes. Not because of circlejerking... but because you are an idiot.
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:50:41
Are you stupid? It's up 80% from 6 months ago. It's up 1,770% from 2 years ago. It's up 9,000% all time. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:10:36
How can it be down 70% when it's up 80%? Do you not math? Or are you actually counting that ridiculous climb where the price was raising by $1,000 an hour? You do realize what a correction is right? It should have never been that artificially inflated in the first place. I wouldn't be surprised if it leveled out around $6,500 for a while. 
"Losing interest" is a weird term seeing as how there is more interest in cryptocurrencies than there ever was. Are you just trolling because you have nothing better to do? I really don't understand your way of thinking.
@_date: 2013-12-31 00:32:54
Why did you copy another comment completely and then post it?
@_date: 2013-08-20 08:39:08
Or throw away account to avoid karma/circle jerk.

While I'm with you on the rest of your statement... unless I'm mistaken, you can't buy BTC without some sort of fiat unless you are a miner. Isn't that correct?
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:34:54
Didn't you mean to say 1 bitcoin is worth $360?
@_date: 2013-09-11 05:54:29
So... what's "flip" do?

u no understand the english?
@_date: 2013-11-14 03:57:11
Ahhhh, good one. But see... I don't need to, because I have access to a vagina to insert my penis into. You'd find that if you stop being such a fucking loser... a woman might actually want to fuck you instead of you having to use your hand all the time. Maybe think about a change in your life path... because you are seriously a pathetic waste of space.
@_date: 2013-08-02 18:54:00
Would've been nice if you wouldn't have written such a misleading title. I got really excited... and then really sad. That's too much of an emotional roller coaster.
@_date: 2013-08-14 05:19:30
Really? I didn't know such places existed! I'm hoping in the US? The real question is... how can I find out about these places near me? 
@_date: 2013-05-03 22:12:40
Now kiss.
@_date: 2013-12-30 23:41:13
I also noticed there is a QR code on top of another one in the photo. Makes it seem..... fishy. But then again, I'm just super paranoid about people trying to scam bitcoin from this sub.
@_date: 2013-08-09 01:57:34
According to my RES, you are a redditor for 2 years because your cake day is actually in 10 days! Happy early cake day!
@_date: 2013-11-13 19:28:10
It's not our fault your dad touches you, so don't take it out on us. 
I never understood why someone would login to reddit and purposely be a dick to the point where they only get thousands of downvotes on the account. You actually spend your time doing absolutely nothing - what's the purpose of it? Does it give you a hard on knowing that people just hate you? Seriously...think about it for a second... That's how pathetic you are. You waste your whole day making stupid comments that no one gives a flying fuck about. Why would someone choose to spend their time that way when there are so many other things you could be doing? 
That's my rant... Now take your immature 10 year old self, and get the fuck out of here.
@_date: 2013-10-08 18:38:18
That's what I voted for.

But... I always thought the term "I could care less" was sarcasm. Does anyone take that sentence literally?

Nonono... you heard wrong. It's not racing stripes, it's carbon fiber patterned stickers. 
@_date: 2013-05-23 01:10:29
Hmmm... idiot thieves for not knowing about a crypto-currency? More like idiot OP: Buys BTC and then leaves over $1,000 worth of them in an unlocked car.

What classifies as "old news?"
