You got a good point there. still this is posted in so i still believe everyone is familiar with the term BTC here.
however you should also post your bitcoin adress. You basically gave them a suggestion to change the term BTC to Bitcoin on their website. If they accept that ,you can be the winner of this

As i see this traders are trading only Bitcoin to Dollars. So for trading on this website you need to own Bitcoins already. 
And i am sure that those who own Bitcoins are familiar with the term BTC.
about the competition  I will advice you to offer Skrill as payment option too. So you will have both Paypal and Skrill and probably get more clients from the countries that do not support paypal.

True thing. There are huge differencies between a social network and a currency, which also happens to be a crypto-currency
