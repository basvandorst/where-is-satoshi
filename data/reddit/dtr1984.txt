Because $10,000 or $20,000 while nice aren't life altering amounts of money. $100,000 is. If I could walk away up $100,000, I'm doing it 10 times out of 10 and most people would do the same. What else am I holding for if not to walk away with life altering amounts of money?

Thank you

You're missing the point. It's about not about 10x or 100x or 1000x. It's about what's life altering and what isn't. Going from $0.001 to $1 is a huge jump % wise but nobody cares. Going from $10,000 to $100,000 is less of a jump but it matters because it's life altering.

So even right now, when the price is obviously going to continue downward, it's still not a good idea to sell? What if it falls to 6k?

When is the right time to buy/sell?  
I keep buying and then it immediately goes down and vice versa. I can never seem to get it right and have lost &gt;$1,500 so far.

I think the same thing.
The chart clearly shows a big spike in 2017 followed by a pull back followed by a smaller spike in 2019 and another lower pullback on the horizon. The trend doesn't look good.
Side note, there's no way this is ever getting to $100,000 or $1,000,000. That's just crazy to me. Everyone would sell if it ever got to even $25,000. You can't tell me there'd be more buyers than sellers at that price.

I agree with your 2nd statement but the difference between $10,000 and $100,000+ is that $10,000 isn't life altering.

Do I use protection? Or does that not work with this analogy?

Dude, grow up.

What does that mean exactly? (asking for the newbs)
@_date: 2019-10-28 15:13:30
Is there an easy way to calculate this?
@_date: 2019-10-10 17:31:18
No, that's just how people talk. You're overreacting big time.

Where can I find charts like this? I'd like to look at ETH too.
