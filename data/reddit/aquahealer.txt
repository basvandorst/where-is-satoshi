It blows my mind every time I meet a person that never heard of the word Bitcoin...then again I guess it proves that there's still tens of millions of new buyers out there  
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:34:51
Just made me sell everything

Wall Street brokers are loving the Bitcoin volatility. Swings of 5 to 10% in a day or two and they're making 5 or 10% on a half million dollars every few days...us HODLers are the suckers

I've waited up to 10 days at times this year so if you see the transaction confirmed just wait for the surprise deposit...happy holidays

Then I'll be able to brag about all the money I lost on Bitcoin. But it seems to be true, when people start taking out mortgages to invest that's when the market goes down....and boom

The minute I sell, it's going to skyrocket...should I save the world?

the super wealthy figured out how to time every market and make billions every time....they invented "the short"...and they did it again.   Three weeks ago Cramer said "As soon as Wall Street starts to short Bitcoin they're going to bring the house down!" Was he right?

Whew that was an awesome ride! I'm sure we all enjoyed it right!!!! We're back!....(wait till the next one!)

If it weren't for all the Bitcoin Bashers out there getting into the heads of many HODLers, there wouldn't be such a bloodbath every time. I fell for it 3 times since January, i should have well over 120k except for my panic selling. I finally I held on...and it was glorious...HODL

you are correct. this is "the revolution" ...and like all revolutions it will be a hard fought battle till the very end. this actually shows us in detail how difficult it was to win the American Revolution, the colonists(common man who bought Bitcoin) fought the UK(Wall Street) and they won...do we have what it takes to win again? or will Wall Street laugh at us as they short us into oblivion while smoking cigars in their diamond studded leather recliners on their million dollar yachts...stay tuned

I made a couple thousand in Bitcoin and it felt so good that I donated $200 to a paralyzed artist in Kenya named Kennedy. He lives in a village with all disabled individuals that have been marginalized by society. Kennedy is a great young man and I try to support him as often as possible. I want Bitcoin to soar so i can help them build a well for the village. Go Bitcoin! Merry Christmas to all!

I see a few facts that assure me Bitcoin is not going to disappear
1. It's an industry...not a fad. This is it, cryptocurrency is here and will be around forever. This is just the beginning. 
2. Miner's control the industry...not the Bitcoin buyers/speculators. At this point there are hundreds if not thousands of companies that are now investing millions of dollars into mining cryptocurrency. They're not doing it with the expectation of it dropping to zero. Nor will they allow it. I know a husband and wife that were attorneys and closed their practice to buy servers that are now crowding their entire living room mining Bitcoin. When one blockchain is worth $250,000 the big boys take notice.
3. James Dimon threatens to fire employees that are trading Bitcoin..., that means there must be a ton of Traders trading Bitcoin. Traders trade to make money, not to lose it.
4. The Winklevoss twins became Bitcoin billionaires... there must be hundreds of Wall Streeters that have 10 to 50 million dollars that will do anything to be billionaires too. They're going to do everything they can to get a piece of the pie. They want to be billionaires far more than we want to be millionaires. We just have to ride their coattails.
5. The Wall Streeters are here to stay... these guys love volatile markets. They have computer software with algorithms that will make billions off of Bitcoin volatility. They're loving this ride
6. Twenty five coins awarded to miners... for each Bitcoin blockchain a miner gets  25 Bitcoins. This lasts till 2020 then it goes to 12.5 coins. Whatever they're worth today they will have to be worth twice as much in 2020 for minors to continue investing in servers to mine cryptocurrency. Right now people want to mine as much as possible before 2020 to maximize their ROI. 
7. Satoshi intentionally designed his code so that one Bitcoin would ultimately be worth $1,000,000....0.00000349 x 1,000,000 = 3.49.  I'm only assuming that he expected Bitcoiners to buy a burger for 349 micros. Otherwise the last digit has no value. 
8. Unfortunately we're at the beginning of the revolution. And that means there's going to be hell to pay for those that are part of the revolution. Governments will rise against cryptos, and only our children and children's children we'll see the full extent of cryptocurrencies success. We're going to get our asses kicked so we must stick together to win this revolution. 
In the end 21 million Bitcoins will be minted which means there's a potential for 21 million millionaires to be made. Being most people hold more than 2 Bitcoins, chances are there's only going to be a few million millionaires made. Stay in the game
Many Bitcoin men have been sent to jail and many more will follow. This is a movement for the common man, we must never give up. The future of generations around the world are depending on us to succeed.
I know I sound like I'm babbling but there's going to be a war over Bitcoin someday and we need to be strong in order to Win It...HODL

I panic sold three times since January, if I didnt I'd be up over 100k... I'm not doing it again. Just take all my damn money already so i dont even have a chance to sell.  I'm riding this wave to shore...

In the far away future...

You should at least receive an email confirmation that tells you when to expect the deposit in your bank account...if all is right in your Bitcoin Universe...if not, then it's gone forever as they say
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:58:48
It might sneak down pretty low...somewhere above 10k but when 2018 arrives hopefully all he'll breaks loose and we're running with the wolves again..HODL

The next real rush won't happen until 2020 when the mining reward goes from 25 coins to 12.5. That's when miners will make half of what they earn now, and they'll need a price increase to stay alive. Can't imagine what it will be like in 2024...
@_date: 2019-08-02 19:57:53
I assume we all know it's the future, similar to seeing the first motor car, or first TV....but when the fk is it going to get here? (then again we probably don't even want to live thru the real revolution of cryptos, it's going to get very ugly all around the world, unfortunately many people will die)

I Sold .18 At $11,323 for $2007 with a fee of $30. I wanted to buy back in at $10,908 but it shows a cost of $2004....something doesn't seem right on coinbase. Shouldn't I get it for $100 less? Is that $30 fee included in the $2007 or on top?

If Bitcoin is a bust then why do multi-millionaires and billionaires hold onto it? I'm just gonna follow those guys, I think they might know something that I don't.
@_date: 2019-09-20 22:40:48
I'm pretty sure Bitcoin will be making millionaires out of those with just one coin in a dozen years. Just gonna have to be patient. But there's gonna be a lot of happy people and that makes me feel good inside...
@_date: 2019-05-29 21:55:40
Considering that there's hundreds if not thousands of companies that accept BTC as currency, it should be around forever. ( and that's what governments are realizing)

When I saw the story from April 4th below I was sure that someone would only invest over $80 million in BTC with the expectations to double their money. BTC was around $4000 that day, it's now gone to 8K and is now sinking. Does anyone know if those investors are now dumping their coins being they doubled their money when it hit 8k?
April 4th...Bitcoin awoke from its slumber this week. The cryptocurrency’s price, which after reaching $20,000 in 2017 has languished near $4,000 for most of 2019, surged more than 20% on Tuesday (April 2), surpassing $5,000. The cause? A mystery trader—or group of traders—reportedly placed a series of large orders on major exchanges, including Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp.
“There has been a single order that has been algorithmically-managed across these three venues, of around 20,000 \[bitcoins\],” said Oliver von Landsberg-Sadie, founder of BCB, a cryptocurrency financial services firm. “If you look at the volumes on each of those three exchanges – there were in-concert, synchronized, units of volume of around 7,000 \[bitcoins\] in an hour,” he explained to Reuters.
