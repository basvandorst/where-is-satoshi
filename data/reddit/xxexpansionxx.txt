And you mentioned the GTX 1080. I could probably stretch my budget to get that, but what would i need to do after buying that?

I seen the Antminer s7 for sale for only about $450 and was seriously considering it. I am not worried about electricity costs, because I'm not paying the bill where I live. From what I've gathered, I figure I can squeeze at least $100 out of the S7 monthly, which IMO would be well worth the purchase. But as I stated, I'm new to this and if I'm wrong about anything please let me know.

Could you explain altcoin to me? I buy bitcoin to primarily spend, not just as an investment. Is altcoin mining more profitable? and can I convert them to bitcoin? ALSO thank you so much for taking the time to answer my questions about all this!!

Time to cash out!

Well I'm still living at my mom's house and in all the contraband she's confiscated over the years I wouldn't feel all that bad about her having to pay a little extra. Cold hearted I know, but whatever

Yeah that what I was sort of afraid of. So what do you think would be a good route for me to go? The PC software is not profitable enough to be worth it for me, and I am only willing to throw $500 at this tops, at the moment.

Happy Birthday my beloved currency. I don't know where I would be without you.

Check update

Ive done this many times with no issue at all so I suppose I had a bit too much confidence. I wasnt very careful with the receipt because I have never needed it before, and have never had coins not show up after ~1 hour
@_date: 2017-04-23 14:28:19
Okay. What do I do from that point?

I sure as hell hope so. This is the first time ive ever had any issues thusfar in buying btc.

I am waiting on a pic of receipt from a friend. Is there any hope of me recovering my coins if the receipt is not available?
@_date: 2017-04-23 13:55:31
hah. But hey man I havent met anyone who stands by ALL of their past. Thats just an unfortunate part of mine
@_date: 2017-04-23 19:39:02
Yes I have truly realized that. Luckily I was (and am) still quite young. I couldn't imagine going back and making more mistakes like I have that would surely lead me to prison.
@_date: 2017-04-23 19:41:11
Hah. Unlikely. She is barely 18, still attends my high school, still works with me, and I've had frequent face to face contact with her since. Things would go too well for HER if she did try something fishy.
EDIT:She just sent pics of receipt
@_date: 2017-04-24 03:05:47
yeah. the one i copied to you is the one that was typed in the atm. but the receipt shows different address for some reason

It was broken up into two purchases. that is the amount of one of them.  the other one is on the second receipt
@_date: 2017-04-23 17:12:45
but! i didnt. and yes my (recent) past is absolutely FUCKED but we can all turn our lives around, can we not?
