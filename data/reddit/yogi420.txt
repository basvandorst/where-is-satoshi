I  agree it needs to be dumbed down. I really want to get into bitcoin and invest and use it for online purchases as well but every time I try to research it i get lost in one rabbit hole after another trying to understand how to do it and do it safely. Most things start out reasonable to understand but then a paragraph in its almost jibberish to the point that I give up and try again in a few days.

Not a hard sell for me. Digital money makes sense. I hate paper money and coins. Such a waste of resources imo. Just wish I had a better understanding of crypto. Back to research tomorrow...

Cool thanks. Whats a wrench attack? Lol
@_date: 2019-11-04 20:09:37
Lol thanks for clarifying. Is this something that actually commonly happens? Enough that there is a term for it? And I agree I would lose it as well lol. I hide things when I'm baked all the time. Then sober me has no idea where it is

What's Robinhood
@_date: 2019-12-02 04:57:50
No idea. Over my head at this point. Sorry

I read somewhere that mining difficulty is determined by popularity. If more ppl are mining it becomes more difficult. If it reaches a point where it's not profitable to farm some miners will stop and the difficulty will reduce to a point where it becomes profitable again. That being said I don't understand most of the things I read on here, but I keep reading them hoping it eventually makes sense lmao. So this could very well be false.

Any pointers or advice on how a beginner can get into earning?
@_date: 2019-09-27 14:55:41
Awesome thanks will check it out

So if I understand it right I can use cash app to buy then transfer to my mobile wallet or hardware wallet and then from there if I want to use it to pay a merchant I should be able to do it from my wallet and if I want to sell I do so with something like cash app to sell or find something with low fees?

Canadian and specifically looking at this one due to the deals through the merchant. I feel like coinbase is legit but not sure if bitcoin made easy by coinbase is legit or someone using their name to seem legit
@_date: 2019-09-25 12:26:23
Thanks for the advice
@_date: 2019-09-27 13:22:34
Awesome thanks will look into cash app and its good to know that this kyc stuff is standard practice
@_date: 2019-09-27 13:23:48
Thanks! I plan on looking into Kraken based on yours and multiple others recommendations.
@_date: 2019-09-27 14:58:19
Apparently not available for Canadians. Can't find in the app store

Ya after all the research and reddit posts I have gone through I decided to make a purchase today only to find out Canadian banks don't allow credit card crypto purchases. Yet another reason to get into crypto and say fuck the banks. Let me make my own choices.
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:26:17
I agree. Wish I was better set financially rihjt now to buy a decent amount.
@_date: 2019-09-27 14:51:37
Awesome thanks

Decided on brd for a mobile wallet. They use coinberry. Was just doing everything through mobile. What do you mean a real exchange?
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:08:54
I agree I don't want to miss out while its low even if its just a small amount right now for online purchasing
@_date: 2019-09-27 21:39:59
Ya hoping that prices stay low til I have cash in hand to use an atm or E-TRANSFER
@_date: 2019-09-27 14:54:48
I see so essentially the same as a fee. Thanks for your help
@_date: 2019-09-27 15:07:38
Yep. I think I may just make a small purchase today using coinbase or coinberry since multiple people have recommended them and from there get into a desktop site like Kraken when I want to start buying larger amounts.
@_date: 2019-09-27 13:20:44
Thanks will look into these today!
@_date: 2019-09-27 13:24:20
Awesome thanks. Didn't know that sub existed. Will definitely check it out.
