In law, there’s also something called the effects doctrine, which basically means if you break the law of a country and the consequences of your conduct are felt within the territory of that country, that country can assert jurisdiction over you.  For example, if you orchestrate a terrorist attack in the U.S. or commit insider trading from your home in Bosnia, the U.S. can still charge and convict you. That’s how mueller was able to charge and convict the Russians who were responsible for the DNC hacking.  when it comes to internet crimes, a nation’s physical borders are less important.

I’ve read that he used to publish stuff on Putin/Russia, but then stopped being critical of Russia altogether.  Additionally, the GOP was hacked as well, but Wikileaks only released damaging stuff about the DNC.  That does not necessarily mean that he received damaging info about the GOP, but still, there is plenty reason to think that he was biased.  He knew that Hillary wanted him dead or arrested.  Trump and Russia was his best bet for freedom.  He was inarguably very self-interested in the result of the election.

The effects doctrine is recognized internationally.

It went beyond mere speculation when the Russian hackers were convicted.  We know that Wikileaks was communicating with both the Russians and at least one of trumps advisors. We also know that Wikileaks stopped criticizing Russia years ago, even though it is an oppressive authoritarian state.  If Wikileaks only cared about freedom of information, it would have kept pressure on a world leader that is known to imprison and murder journalists.  
Also the truth of that information is not all that matters because it was used as a political gambit by a candidate and a foreign adversary to discredit one political party and give power to a another party and administration that is equally or more criminal.  The GOP was hacked too, but Wikileaks did not spill the dirt on them.  All of this points to Wikileaks being a tool, not a beacon of light.
