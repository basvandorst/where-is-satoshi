But if development ceases and the network moves on to the point where the old clients can't connect, then it would be really painful to spend those coins.
I was using an old version of Electrum a while back and was generating bad transactions that couldn't be relayed after broadcast, some BIP or other had come along and changed what was valid in the last year or so.
For this reason, for offsite long-term HODL storage I recommend printing out a list of private keys 3 times. Cut the papers into 3 and store parts 1&amp;2, 2&amp;3, 1&amp;3 in different places. Two of the locations would have to be compromised to spend your funds, you can afford to lose one location, and you are protected against technology changes.

Very few people upvote an opinion they disagree with just because it took effort and is an honest attempt to express a view or add to the discussion, yet many use the downvote to mean "I disagree." The result is that this community directly, by their own hand, votes for oppression of different views. If the mods in or were imposing their views and censoring discussion then the community could quite rightly argue that this acts against the culture of the sub, but has no right.
Look at the heavily downmodded comments in any discussion in this sub and you'll see that dissenting opinions are punished by much of our user base. When the hivemind heavily moderates people who have a different view, and those dissenters go into negative karma on this sub, they are rate limited to the point of contribution being a chore. This has a chilling effect on free discussion and is direct censorship by the community itself. This is something we are all guilty of.
The way I see it is the moderation that deserves. Like the userbase he is unwavering in his economical and political stances, represents conflicted interests and is happy to use censorship to stifle discussion.
So in my humble opinion you should all clean your own houses before accusing others of living in filth.

A blockchain allows distributed consensus, these sort of networks allow physical, local ownership of something digital. The sort you can put in your safe. You don't get that with a centralized database, the money is always in someone else's safe.

Say you have a=&gt;b=&gt;c=&gt;d=&gt;e=&gt;f=&gt;g and then you spend money with g to the same provider as a, then you've revealed that you own b, c, d, e and f and that sends from those addresses to other addresses were most likely purchases. That's far more likely than you paid someone who then paid you back later with the change from the same money. This can be used to get a good idea of how economically active you are, it can be used to map your contacts too.
That's why we need shared send built into all wallets, using We also need anonymous exchanges that allow conversion to cryptonote currencies and back again

Looks like it was on the darknet.
@_date: 2015-11-17 01:30:35
Let's say you have $1000 and buy something for $10 with the change sent to the next address B. Your payment processor can make assumption that you owned $1000 in Bitcoin and now have $990. Now let's say you obscure this by splitting it into five other addresses, they don't know which is your address and which ones you've spent, but at some point in the future you'll use a payment processor that knows who you are and can link these together, the taint can be retrospectively computed along the entire chain based on multiple data points. It's easier if they are tracking multiple people on the network.
The core is that it's very difficult to remain anonymous on the Bitcoin network because each time you spend you leak information. Not only is it not safe to re-use addresses but it's not safe to spend from more than one address at the same time, nor is it safe to consolidate change because by spending change from different leaf nodes at distant edges of the tree you reveal the structure of ownership in the branches below, about the past, about your peers. Payment processors can gather huge amounts of information about ownership on the network and interactions between people and businesses.
To just brush this off shows staggering naivety. Sit down and actually think about the problem and you'll come to see that Bitcoin is the NSA's wet dream, in its current form it allows unlimited financial surveillance.

Yeah that's exactly what it'll become. Right now there is no main darknet market, Agora wound down and closed, Abraxas has exit-scammed, Alphabay is run by carders and the others are too small. A huge number of dealers were hurt by Abraxas running off with everyone's funds so right now there's consumer pressure and a supplier void.
I think there's good (ethical) money to be made providing an on-ramp to OpenBazaar in the form of a web front-end that punters can use over Tor, risking their bitcoin if they like, while dealers can use the network directly.
As for eBay-defeating, Silk Road had tons of legal products sold on the market purely due to the network effect and I can see this happening again if a market were to become as much of a hub. There could also be web storefronts that use the network behind the scenes, a kind of package deal that usurps PayPal, eBay and the CC companies in one move. I don't think it will kill the likes of Amazon and eBay but it should put some pressure on them and cause them to change, which will IMO be a good thing.

I'm a technical person. It's my opinion that I could build software that could track transactions using a statistical model with a high degree of accuracy, but I'd need access to BitPay and Coinbase's databases to do so. If I can do it then other people can do it, people far smarter than I.
You haven't contributed anything technical, just shoulder-shrugging and distraction. You've presented no technical arguments, no rebuttal, no insight, so your opinion is less than worthless. It's time consuming noise.
So, show me that you understand any part of what I've said and why it's wrong or just stop bothering me. I have code to write.
@_date: 2015-11-17 05:01:46
Then present a technical argument.
1. A Bayesian model includes a model of its own inaccuracy. It would know how inaccurate it is.
2. The example I gave where you have one address, multiple spends with chained change addresses, then another spend, possibly years later, that gives a high degree of confidence that the entire chain belongs to one user. Taint analysis only gets exponentially weaker if you only have one data point, the more points you have in the same chain the more of the tree it reveals. This means the recommended, default, usual use-case of Bitcoin is almost as bad as address re-use. It's not as bad, but most wallets are pretty fucking bad out of the box.
3. Combining change addresses in a single transaction spreads the taint right up the tree. So if you wish to remain anonymous by splitting up your coins you need to split funds off into wallets that you can never combine again or spend on something tied to your real identity, unless you're completely sure that the person you're sending them to is not sharing information with others. That's a huge flaw. You need to manually control the tree of transactions to remain anonymous and ensure no cross-contamination occurs.
4. The more information an adversary has about the rest of the community, the they can infer about individuals. Attacking anonymity with one piece of data is really hard but it gets much easier the more data you have.
6. You only need to slip up once to slip up forever. Bitcoin is a loaded gun and your privacy is one squeeze away from a fatal footbullet  
5. If everyone was mixing by default or anonymity was built in then most of this problem would go away. 
If you don't think that's a problem then you're just plain wrong.

But the payment processors can label them, mine them for information. They know your change address and link that to other transactions, different payment processors could collude to track users for market research, advertising or other nefarious purposes. It can be done so we must assume it will be done, unless we fix the problem.

@_date: 2015-11-17 02:23:24


How exactly do you propose to do this? Do you have a huge stash of Bitcoin you mined yourself that has no history? Unless you mix then each spend will reveal information about past ownership. 
Consider this simple example:
    Addr1 -- paid --&gt; providerA
       |
       |  change
       V
    Addr2  -- paid --&gt; Individual
       |
       | change
       V
    Addr3  -- unknown --&gt; Addr4
       |
       | unknown
       V
    Addr5 -- paid --&gt; providerA
       |
       | change
       V
    Addr6
No address re-use but your provider has 100% knowledge that  and  were controlled by you. It has reasonable suspicion that  and  are owned by you. The use of  hugely increases the likelihood that  and  are owned by you and slightly decreases the likelihood that  is owned by you. Map this into a statistical model and with enough information you can get Bayesian probabilities for things like "does the owner of these addresses use this darknet market?", and this is possible because **no matter how careful you are, every bitcoin transaction leaks a small amount of information**. That is a fundamental rule of the system and cannot be escaped.

Actually you can thank the continued efforts of Chris Belcher and Adam Gibson, directly with Bitcoin if you like (1AZgQZWYRteh6UyF87hwuvyWj73NvWKpL) since they're doing it all for free.

I hear the Somalian model is a good example of a decentralized market for imprisonment and retribution.

Same here. SSD disk on portable hardware is expensive, and at the moment you only get the one terrabyte on a desktop replacement so I'm not throwing away a significant fraction of that.

How can you claim to represent the community when this decision and others like it are so unpopular?


A "safe space", really? I AM TRIGGERED RIGHT NOW.

The "article" is six sentences long, it's terse enough to be useless.

Think of work as a purely economical transaction. The money and respect you can command is determined purely by the number of people bidding for your time, it is in your interest to widen that pool as much as possible. The more bidders there are, the better price I get for my time. Ruling out any bidders at all weakens your position, it makes you a bad businessman.
Also let's say someone wants me to suck their dick. I don't suck dick but if I was offered say $5M then I'd suck that fucking thing for a whole night rather than go to work for 25 years. The same is true with employers, I'll work for a shit company whose values I disagree with if they paid me fuck you money.
Finally, the masses don't have the skillset I have, they're scrambling to suck dick for minimum wage. What the fuck happens to our democracy when voting for workers' rights ensures you won't get a job?
You're talking about handing more power over to the people who already have all the power. Assuming that you're a peasant like the rest of us you should be an advocate of more freedoms and rights for people like yourself, and less for your oppressors to oppress us with. Otherwise you're on the wrong side!
Back on topic: An ideal system is one where individuals can prove to themselves alone that their vote was counted and that the right number of votes were tallied. [Prêt à Voter]( / [TVS]( is the state of the art here.

Same. Disk on portable hardware is expensive, and if you have a decent desktop replacement with SSD then you aren't likely to have terrabytes of space to spare. 50GB is a lot of space.
