@_date: 2015-12-23 15:36:55
Nope. They have it right....Merry Christmas.
@_date: 2015-12-23 15:46:38
I just signed up on the app.  I don't see any free bitcoin in my wallet.
@_date: 2015-12-11 05:56:08
Go to 
Get bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-16 14:30:01
Will increasing the block size also increase the number of bitcoins available from 21 million to whatever..???
@_date: 2015-12-17 21:38:00
Seems like SCAM.  Don't do it.
@_date: 2015-12-14 17:10:34
Will there be a hard fork for Bitcoin to address the scaling issue.  ie bip, bitcoin xt, etc.
If so, will I need a new wallet after the hard fork?  Will my current wallet still work with my balances.?
@_date: 2015-06-11 21:28:00
i didn't get my .0005btc.
@_date: 2015-06-15 16:14:27
BTC	2.00000000	1CRVr2YszghKjzJNfYztfBswxgLMaTkzyt	2015-06-15 14:25:00	AWAITING APPROVAL
@_date: 2015-12-21 18:21:53
i created a paper wallet for someone as a present and mailed it.  And will add more bitcoin to it as time go on.
Will that paper wallet be good forever if the person never cash out / sweep it to blockchain?
@_date: 2015-12-26 00:07:11
Am i too late for some btc?
@_date: 2015-06-25 14:48:27
thanks.  I will hold them up to that.
@_date: 2015-12-11 17:36:37
ok.  I'll contact them.   I thought it happend to everyone.
thanks.  
@_date: 2015-12-16 15:21:32
How can i buy them?  They only sell to integrators, big mining companies, not general folks.
@_date: 2015-12-27 19:54:52
I live in WA. Electricity is not cheap.   .0958 cents for first 500watts/hr after 500watts, it jumps to .1145 cents.  Thats .5kw..my 2 refrigerators puts it passed that..n have to pay 11cents.
@_date: 2015-12-11 17:36:01
I did.
I made a purchased before and able to set my discount.
@_date: 2015-06-15 16:15:12
I updated the post with the BTC address.
@_date: 2015-06-15 16:17:52
I did, that's why it went into awaiting approval.  Else, you can't get to this stage.
@_date: 2015-06-24 18:54:41
So, it's another SCAM?  Will I ever see my 1 BTC back?
@_date: 2015-05-04 20:55:03
They give you Free .03 BTC, around 8 dollars for signup.
@_date: 2015-05-21 19:33:18
They told me they will NOT give me the winnings.
@_date: 2015-05-14 19:23:42
I sent them an email after it happened.  Now waiting for their reply.  Keep you posted.
@_date: 2015-05-04 21:51:02
you need to verify your account against frauds.  Go to deposit / withdrawal and follow the instruction to get verify.
Once verified any one who registers get .03 btc promo.
@_date: 2016-03-04 15:18:01
Liar. Not true.  You get refunds to the same payment method you used to pay for it.   
If u used credit cards, u r refunded back to ur CC.
@_date: 2016-01-03 06:08:48
Go to 
Has all info.
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:44:34
Great now we can move on without XT.  Hooray....cause it sucks.
@_date: 2016-03-01 21:24:09
No.  Next thing u know, it 20 cents, then 80 cents, then 5 dollars, then , .... then, then....
Before you know it, to send $1.00, you'll have to pay an additional $1.25 totaling $2.25.  Just to send $1.  ..not exact, but you get the point.
@_date: 2016-03-10 15:46:35
My instant buy just declined by Chase Credit card as well.  So, it's not just him.
@_date: 2016-03-02 14:59:05
Do you think merchants will use bitcoin if the know they know they have to wait 43 mins to receive funds?  
What would you do as a merchant or shopper when you have to wait 43 minutes in the check out line??
@_date: 2016-01-12 19:23:19
how do i get some ybcoin with my btc.?
even factom is up 80%.
@_date: 2016-01-25 17:33:24
yes. It's up now.
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:24:00
Mike Hearn left like a disgruntled employee.  He is bitter.  
Bitcoin is not controlled by you or any person. That's what great about it.  It will continue doing well with or without you.
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:48:24
Coinbase sucks...if there,s an alternative doing wht they do in the u s. I would jump ship.
@_date: 2016-01-22 03:35:04
Yes pls.  Ur so generous.
@_date: 2016-03-10 15:45:57
Mine was declined also for the first time.  I've been instant buying $100 for a while now and all of a sudden Chase credit card declined and no more instant buy.   Will American Express allow it?
@_date: 2016-03-15 17:35:32
btc price will be $45.
@_date: 2015-08-12 22:07:08
It's a SCAM. yes.
@_date: 2015-08-06 14:46:12
That sucs, not able to claim ownership.
@_date: 2015-07-21 14:07:22
This says it all:  
@_date: 2015-07-30 15:57:21
nope.  I don't know any roundabout way through vouchers.  Wished I knew the steps.  If you tell me how, I'll try.  Please let me know if there's another way.  Thank you.  
I've been periodically logging in to try to withdraw, but it always get that same "unexpected error".
@_date: 2015-07-24 14:53:24
Send it back.  It's been tampered with.
@_date: 2015-07-22 14:56:37
it's below $500 now.
@_date: 2016-02-09 18:18:14
IMO, I think it will go to 250.
@_date: 2016-02-05 16:50:22
So, like the internet back then, it WILL crash greatly.
Or will cease to exist like so many internet companies back then.
I suggest stop comparing to back then.
@_date: 2016-02-09 18:13:45
Will I lose my BTC is one wins vs the other?  I bought my btc years ago under Core.  If classic wins will my coins be converted into Classic  by itself or do I need to do anything to convert my old coins into "new" coins like you said?
so confuse.
Can I double my coin holdings in some way?
@_date: 2016-02-24 23:20:37
That's not a solution.  If everyone sens with "urgent" fee, we'll be in the same boat.  Hours or days to confirm.  Merchants are not going to use bitcoin for this reason.  Can,t blame them.  Bitcoin can't scale.  That's why many folks say it'll be replaced.
@_date: 2016-02-25 17:32:15
pretty soon, fees will be so high, higher than visa/mc combined just to get transactions confirmed.  And you'll still have to wait 3 days for confirmation no matter if the fee is 10% of the btc you sent.  
As of right now, Bitcoin can't scale.
@_date: 2016-02-08 18:29:08
@_date: 2016-02-19 16:11:49
You can buy with CC or wire transfer at more info here.:  how to get bitcoin. option 2.
@_date: 2015-07-24 14:38:46
I don't think so.  Nothing beats the dollar.  Nothing.
@_date: 2016-02-25 21:06:12
How much dash will you get from what you just said? and is it per week or per month?
@_date: 2016-02-17 19:46:00
thank you.
@_date: 2015-04-21 14:01:13
This is why bitcoin price will go higher...i think.
@_date: 2015-04-28 18:51:26
too late to say hi&gt;.? 
@_date: 2015-04-03 16:57:11
how?  I can't do any withdrawal from terabox.  And my emails to them don't get a reply.
@_date: 2015-04-20 22:15:02
They are doing it now. Fed reserve are doing it as we speak.  That's why ron paul wanted to get rid of the federal reserve.
@_date: 2015-04-03 17:04:07
how do you play?  how to receive the btc, if you know what the painting is.?
@_date: 2015-04-30 14:09:14
Is it too late...?
@_date: 2015-11-27 05:00:20
Who cares about USD. We,re talking bout world economy.  Is the world economy more than 21 trillion dollars?  U bet.
Bitcoin will b more trusted than USD.. US has been printing money hand over fist.  Where does tht money come from. They can print forever. Bitcoin can only have 21 million.
@_date: 2015-11-27 00:34:15
Go to  milliondollarbitcoin.co
They list 3 ways to do it.
@_date: 2015-03-25 18:54:52
tatertatertatertot has it right.  I don't want to put more money.  I don't want to pump more money into something if it continues to go down.  I don't make enough to continue to put more money in.  If it goes to $50 a btc, then it wouldn't make sense.  Maybe it won't go that low...maybe $100 a btc.?
@_date: 2015-03-25 15:04:28
Don't go with Circle.com
@_date: 2015-11-30 15:07:55
So now we will have 8 reserve currencies now?   When they add resever currencies  india rupee, then reserve  will be bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-02 16:04:38
Yes. Safe. Dont need to worry about it.  Pass it down to many generations. BUT when you take it out, u need to do a sweep, withdraw the WHOLE entire amount to whatever place u need to take out. 
If u don't take out the entire amount n left some in the paper wallet, you will lose them.
And DON'T encrypt them,  if u pass away, lost ur memory, ur family can still withdraw the whole amount with only that piece of paper.
@_date: 2015-03-25 18:12:18
just wanted to say ur right.
@_date: 2015-03-25 14:54:34
Easy.  Go to coinwidget.com and install the widget in your site.  It has a nice bitcoin donation icon.  Just enter ur btc address and it has a QR scan also.  That's what i use.
@_date: 2015-03-25 18:44:00


u need to do an update.
@_date: 2015-03-25 15:06:45
@_date: 2015-03-26 13:59:32
update ur vpn client also..or reinstall the client.
@_date: 2015-03-25 16:17:20
now u tell me.  I just paid .8 btc for cloud mining with terabox.me.  Should have searched first...but who has the time to search out each time you want to make a purchase. I was thinking bitcoincloudservices.com also, but terabox.me was cheap.  Ur right John.
@_date: 2015-03-25 17:01:40
@_date: 2015-11-25 21:03:41
I think a bitcoin can go up to 1 million.
