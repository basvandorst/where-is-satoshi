Well, i'm not planning on doing that so i can explain my point of view.
I'm investing a fixed fiat amount, each month, every month. (The famous "money i can lose") 
Is it really worth it to cash out, knowing i will put it back soon?
In the end i will have the same amount of fiat + fiat worth crypto, less the fees. In fact i even can have less crypto if price moon. 
This is true if: bullish market, or less than fees drops. The only time it can be worth is if there is a big crash OR if i make fuckload of benefits in one time and my crypto is worth more than i'm willing to put in months/years. Spoiler: It's not.
TL:DR: Because of the fees and my investing style, I can see myself rebalancing my portfolio, but not cashing out unless life changing amount. Which is not happening soon. (And wil maybe never happen)

Not this kind of issue
- Open CoinBase account
- Order ~50$ of BTC
- Receive a mail at my house by my bank, asking if i got hacked

In theory no, you just need to reset the seed and create another one. Even if the seller still got the keys, creating another will erase it so you're good.
The only thing that can be dangerous is if the hardware is compromised but hardware wallets are built to not let it happend and IIRC we still don't know someone who managed to did it.
Got a hard time to sell my old Nanos 'cause of that.
