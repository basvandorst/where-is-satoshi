If you need 100% taint removed it appears that the traditional mixer service like 'bitcoinfog' is now the best option. Unfortunate since the fee's are so high.
You can also risk using the 'CoinSlinger' for the next few days while the shared send is still usable in the API, but I would recommend against it since we know nothing of this person (assumption.)

I love how you can write 'false' but you are not even educated on the law.
I read the book. I understand the law.
You, apparently, do not.
And you are right, there is no 'secret' way to legally avoid taxes. Its not a 'secret'. Its public information, published directly on the site. You can download the book, read the law, and make the determination for yourself.
Im sure you wont do so however. You will just sit in your ignorance claiming thing's you are clearly uneducated on.

First, thank you so much for the response!
Second, when you say "remedy this in future" what kind of time frame are we talking about?
Privacy is something that is extremely important to the bitcoin community and removing this feature is a large blow to the privacy advocates. 
If there are any alternative ways to provide 0% taint could you please educate us on them? 
Thank you for your response.

News flash  You are not legally bound to pay capital gains on BTC profit unless you are doing so under the employement of the federal government.
Gains achieved through private sector work are NOT taxable.
Read up on the legal framework of the IRS and educate yourself. DO NOT PAY THE IRS VOLUNTARILY MONEY YOU DO NOT OWE THEM

Educate yourself. Read the book. 'Cracking the Code'
 - you can download it there for free.
When you've educated yourself, come back and talk to me. Until then, your input is irrelevant.
