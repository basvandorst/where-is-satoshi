You should also get tulipsforbitcoin.com and have it forward there. Would be smart.
@_date: 2015-03-06 15:43:08
And to help them fuel development. Would be an impressive move.
@_date: 2015-03-03 17:53:39
It doesn't cost much. I wouldn't wait. If your site grows and someone else reads this and takes it you'll be kicking yourself.
@_date: 2015-03-06 19:12:33
Don't assume. I'm very happy with the number I have. ; )
I'm generalizing. Most wealthy people in this world, right now, really dislike Bitcoin as far as my observations. Of course there will be outliers and scattered large investors with our mindset.
@_date: 2015-03-06 15:41:38
Yup! Wouldn't it be sweet if he just gave us all a huge present and showed proof that he destroyed them all? Would be crazy...
@_date: 2015-03-03 18:45:01
Yah, dees es awesome moose.
@_date: 2015-03-03 19:32:53
Many people trust them more than their own computers or their ability to learn 'proper storage'. Super, easy, self storage that is truly worry-free and secure doesn't exist yet... I hope it does soon.
@_date: 2015-03-05 01:26:17
Smart was the new sexy, but now I see dumb is. This article opened my eyes. 
@_date: 2015-03-02 23:46:56
I'm upvoting all over your face you magnificent bastard.
@_date: 2015-03-06 18:25:40
It's going to be glorious.
@_date: 2015-03-03 18:52:28
Thank you. What about the Bitcoin it holds offline? In their cold wallets?
@_date: 2015-03-06 17:49:22
I've had the same conversations. Very, very rich people dont like it either. It's psychologically disturbing, like their huge home's foundation has a crack in it, their hot wife is texting a new 'friend' a lot and wearing more makeup, their aging dog is starting to limp or someone is whispering in their mind, late at night, after a few drinks, "The truth is not what it seams... all these years you've been mistaken... a change is coming..."
Fear of the unknown, hubris, dismission, ego and the rational dismantling of ones own world... is hard to bare. 
We are among the fortunate and sapient here.
@_date: 2015-03-05 01:37:20
You're one of the reasons I got into Bitcoin. Thank you for your efforts!
@_date: 2015-03-03 05:53:58
You want conversion? Today I told my mother (in her 70s) about Bitcoin and didn't pressure her at all and it was HER, who, after asking many questions for 40 minutes eventually said, "How can I get some"? And this was even after I told her of all the potential risks and downsides. This after telling her that it can all go to zero and she could lose all her investment. She still wanted to get some exposure. She still wanted in. Shit's changing folks. The truth can stand on it own. No hype needed. People see the bullshit of the financial system more than ever and the greater sense of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-20 02:05:50
Haha exactly my thinking. I toast you, my brother.
@_date: 2015-03-06 15:14:12
Yup. The sloshing bathtub is low looking more like a large kiddie pool at the local park.  There will never be another Goxing like that.
@_date: 2015-03-02 20:26:06
Exactly. When are people going to get this? The people in here are far from the mainstream.
@_date: 2015-02-10 04:25:55
Banks don't like it because they can't control it or get in bed with the creators. That simple. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:08:35
Did they ever do a piece on bitcoin?
Edit: I think we should email their producers. A bitcoin piece would be far, far more helpful to Bitcoin than most of you realize. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:57:45
I think it all boils down to when their analysts believe they will make more money, if even a little, by accepting Bitcoin. I also believe awareness is a factor. Sending then emails DOES help to some degree. By the way you can get Jeff's email on the Internet. His assistants get the email and relay to him. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 02:52:38
i disagree. This year we will see a bubble.
@_date: 2015-02-28 19:04:42
First time there, I totally agree with you. They need to darken the text a bit. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 05:29:20
Haha. I've invented a new word it seems.
@_date: 2015-02-14 09:52:15
Yes you will, because I just upvoted all over your face. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:52:16
Just that it needs to become extremely, extremely simple to use for the average person. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:11:29
It's a highly complex and layered piece of performance art, advertising, ideological statement, calling and above all, irony that transcends the mind's ability to grasp all its inherent dynamics and nuances at once. Only by transitionally varying one's states of consciousness can a personal 'knowing' of its meta-holistic grand awesomeness be embraced. All this, done in the greatest feat of simplicity and undermining humility of craft ever produced. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 19:14:02
I guarantee you they are already considering it. Let's push them over the edge into doing it!
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:31:00
No, I'm saying if it's stagnant during a tail end of a bubble, that's actually a good sign. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 19:40:57
I think there needs to be a website listing Bitcoin friendly banks, country by country. Bitbanks.com or something.
@_date: 2015-02-18 05:28:57
Yup. I'll be first in line.
@_date: 2015-02-20 19:35:16
But no one is stopping you from selling at the same time.
@_date: 2015-02-13 19:38:51
It's feeling a little sexy in here.
@_date: 2015-02-18 02:34:50
No. It's sexy.
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:14:59
My addiction to Bitcoin has added joy, excitement and worth to my life. I'm not even mad.
@_date: 2015-02-20 19:29:41
This makes no sense.
@_date: 2015-02-21 15:24:09
I think it's very powerful to simply ask nicely, "Do you guys take Bitcoin?". And leave it at that. Over time it will sink into their consciousness, especially when others ask them the same thing as the weeks and months go by.
@_date: 2015-02-28 22:10:47
Is that why our naughty bits are rising? : )
@_date: 2015-02-21 19:00:00
Yup, still confusing. We need an app that makes it all way easier. People don't have time to learn all the complexities.
@_date: 2015-02-28 19:01:45
Dated a girl fresh off the boat from Thailand. She said no one wears helmets there because if you die, it was meant to be (your fate). So no one worried about it. She was Buddhist and a lot of what she said freaked me out. In nine months I never once saw her get mad. Not once. Happiest person I've ever known. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 01:12:43
...so that people don't know you own bitcoins? : D
@_date: 2015-02-26 18:47:24
What if they first asked, "have you heard of Bitcoin?" If yes, pamphlet is given. If no, paper wallet.
@_date: 2015-02-15 00:49:29

Go big or go home. Life is short.

Don't worry... the funny thing is that XBT will be the future name of Bitcoin, so they're going to look very ridiculous, very soon. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 01:50:40
Well, I'm about to mortgage my house for bitcoins. How's that for courage!
@_date: 2015-02-22 01:17:15
Depends on... how high/shitfaced you are.
@_date: 2015-02-23 22:29:27
I just got wet. And I'm a dude. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 19:28:39
Not sexy.
@_date: 2015-02-27 20:29:31
Same thing happened to me. It said they'd 'get back to me in a few days' and that was like a month ago. They're losing customers with this thing.
@_date: 2015-02-20 19:24:46
I mean from here on out. By the way, I find it ironic someone in a progressive thinking, enlightened subreddit has your username. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 10:54:03
I don't trust my ignorance. Computers scare me. I want to outsource to someone or something easy and safer than me. I'm just an average joe who doesn't have the time to understand all the layers of doing it right yourself.
@_date: 2015-02-22 01:31:25
I clicked to deposit funds into circle and got a message that they "needed to look into some things" and will email me "in a few days". That was three weeks ago. Still nothing.
@_date: 2015-02-28 19:10:43
Jesus that's hard to watch. The look of "I fucked up and I'm losing the battle to save face with every word I continue to say" is as obvious as her lack of sleep (how ironic that she surely thought it would launch her career). 
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:33:01
And a dick move. Corporate aggression is a huge turn off to many. Don't push me to sign up for something. I will forever look at your brand as a bully and munipator. Make my life easier and FREER please if you want my loyalty and word of mouth recommendation (which is golden).
@_date: 2015-02-25 18:17:00
The fun part is calculating your worth should Bitcoin hit $50,000!
@_date: 2015-02-20 19:37:15
And if it were you who had 400k Bitcoins, you would say what?
@_date: 2015-02-28 14:30:38
Coindesk is a joke. People need to simply ignore them. They've lost all credibility to me.

Please tell me this is fake. It has to be.
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:20:29
Yup. Why there aren't 20 startups around the world furiously doing just this is beyond me (unless there is and I don't know).
@_date: 2015-02-21 17:52:39
Well, three letter domains are all snatched, usually by corporations. It's no surprise. But they're gonna hate the insane traffic in the future over at xbt.com.
@_date: 2015-02-18 05:23:15
I got the same email. I told them the truth... I have nothing to hide. They have their job to do, I totally understand. Did it make me a little mad and uncomfortable? Hell yeah. I still told them their needed info. Why? Because I need them right now. One day I won't. On that day I will transfer my coins to a place that is equally safe, simple, but way more private. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 18:45:36
You think so? I don't know, to me it comes down to exposure and awareness of facts. I was once a skeptic too, until I kept seeing the word 'Bitcoin' more and more in the news. Then I watched a few videos and got hooked on the sophisticated realities surrounding it... a grasping that took time. One great video/talk can break through the flippant dismissiveness in many people.
@_date: 2015-02-18 02:46:51
Who wants to live paranoid of an audit? I pay and will continue to... despite my reservations.

Well some alts have done it better, but the network effect is what it is. What can you do about it? Do you want us to scrap all of Bitcoin at this point? The pros outweigh the negatives. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 05:53:21
Good point. What's interesting to me is that right now Coinbase people are huddled around a large desk in a conference room reading all our comments and debating if they should respond to this or not. My money is that they will, and it will be short and polite. 
@_date: 2015-02-26 16:42:38
What I really love, is that they're reading these comments. So, here's my opinion: Coinbase should have random people walk around cities and hand people slips of paper... Which are cold wallets with actual btc (like a dollar on it) with simple instructions on the back about what Bitcoin is, and how to open a wallet at coinbase. BOOM. You just got someone getting back to work or home and talking about it with other people. You just got someone excited and curious abou Bitcoin. You just got someone opening a Coinbase account.

@_date: 2015-02-21 22:29:42
No, he/she is right. Despite some sloppiness, 60 minutes usually bats really well with integrity. I've followed them a long time. The public eats up their segments as gospel of truth usually. A piece from them will end up with both caution and praise for Bitcoin... But, in the end it will GREATLY increase AWARENESS... which can only help, right?
@_date: 2015-02-25 18:14:15
I'm fapping to the two of you.

Just pointing out confirmation bias. I bet if it were his 400k, he would easily find appropriate reason for it being okay. This post clearly is implying it's not okay for anyone to have that many... or to be rich.

You're ecstified!
@_date: 2015-02-10 03:19:37
I like those kinds of videos. Inspiring. But we must not do the us vs them thing. In the end, the them... IS us. That's the higher understanding. Do not villainize the 1%, as we would have done as they did in their shoes. See them as ignorant and still love them. Leave a smarter legacy and world of enlightenment so their children will not ever be able to follow their shoes.

Yeah, I almost said that. It's a good solution! I think there might also even be a way for the giveaway to be done sensational enough that the media runs free stories on it.

A horizontal line during a huge price decrease? I'd take that as a huge positive given the increasing infrastructure falling into place. The bubble is over, the price is where it should be. The smallest sign, as we're seeing now, that the price has bottomed will change investor sentiment significantly. You'll see.
