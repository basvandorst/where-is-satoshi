The ECDSA relies on a hash function to work. That hash function is SHA-256. It is broken without it. ECDSA relies on the same crytography. It is not a cipher nor a hash. 
Additionally, read my post again. I am not talking about brute-force but intentional hidden backdoors which are feasible with enough time and effort. The NSA has the budget, incentive and talent to do such a thing.

I will argue it does considering it has a classified budget dedicated towards this field. Nobody has the resources to match them nor the taxpayer funding.

It has been technically broken.

Everyone in the world can see it. Not everyone can fully analyze it nor understand it. Nor does everyone have the resources to do it. It is EXPENSIVE to read these things and it is only 4 years old.

You're incorrect. SHA-256 was designed exclusively by the NSA. 
Bitcoin relies on SHA-256 hashes and digital signatures. The digital signatures rely on SHA-256 as its hash function.

Bitcoin should use Bcrypt. As of its 2011 version, there are no known attacks against its cipher Blowfish. Blowfish as an algorithm has been tested and improved upon since 1993.

They have found weaknesses in SHA-256. It is susceptible to pre-image attacks.

I want to be able to trade with only 1 BTC and grow it with minimal fees.
Additionally, let's hope California's regulations don't kill you!

Yes. They have the resources. They have more resources in this field than anybody else. These people aren't working for free.

It's not a piece of software. It's an algorithm. It takes a good amount of expertise to fully read into it.
