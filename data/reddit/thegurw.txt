I would humbly ask that you support my local children's hospital, one of the best on the continent, the [Stollery Children's Hospital]( It's saved the lives of many of my relatives and friends' children, and is also part of the University of Alberta Hospital - making it one of the world's leading research hospitals specializing in children's medical research, specifically neonatal research; as well as one of the best teaching hospitals for medical students interested in children's medicine.
While the day-to-day running of the hospital is funded by our taxes, the Stollery supports expansion, new equipment, and additional surgeries and beds almost entirely through donations and fundraising. Even a small amount makes a huge difference in the lives of the children and families that undergo treatment at the hospital.

I typically say city, province, country.
Because the Prairies of Canada are sparse, there are many states that fit between the two large cities in my province; and many of those states are larger than some countries in Europe.

I've always just carried one through, rather than trying to do four little lines, one vertical strikethrough works for me.

I'm afraid I'm not very good at explaining anything about Bitcoin, sorry. There are others who could give you the information you seek, however.

Bitcoin doesn't need the internet to work, though...

You say that like our PM has direct control over stuff like that. He's not a president. He can't sign an executive order and people have to listen. He's the leader of the political party currently in power, so head of government. He's not head of state.
Also, source please? I haven't heard about this and I'd like to know.

Pretty sure it was the Netherlands since in the bigger picture you can see what appears to be a police vehicle from that specific country.

My first time brother, yours will come.

Good to know your constitutional rights are intact, eh? Oh... Wait....

Look at it like, they can stand on the street and see what appears to be growing equipment through your big bay window. That's probable cause and perfectly constitutional. Same with excessive power use and massive amounts of heat.

I understand this reference.
And I'm gonna go read it again.

[It's long, but so, SO worth it.](
Basically, it's a tabletop RPG, where a Game Master is a prick, and a specific, dedicated player goes WAY over the top to absolutely _destroy_ everything the GM was trying to do, in the most hilarious fashion possible.

Someone is trying to get it back already though.

When that becomes true for more than just a handful of people in a given area, there will be a utility company that will say "we accept Bitcoin".
