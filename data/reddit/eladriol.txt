I don't know one way or the other if transactions have been faked to slow the network. But if they have isn't that a massive security hole If a well resourced small group can bring the whole network to a grinding halt?

If no one wants to buy a currency then it's value is 0. Hyperinflation is just a means of getting a currency to 0 faster - it's typically caused by the same thing, a lack of people wanting the currency (in that the government can no longer pay for stuff so prints more money)

I'm curious, what does this mean for the long term future of bitcoin? You'll always have corrupted hard-drives, people dying without passing down keys or whatever.
You could say it was more likely back in the past when bitcoins were cheaper - but there's now more bit coin holders to make mistakes.
Surely even if the price of bitcoin 'Stabilizes' from a supply-demand perspective, the long term future of bitcoin is that more and more of it will be lost forever, hence in the long term it will always be deflationary. 
Will the hard limit get revised, or will that just be a feature of bitcoin? If it's a feature what are the implications for the economy if money is only destroyed long run?

Why would you assume that everything else holds constant?
Much easier variables are hashrate (people stop mining and sell/doon't buy replacement gear because prices are too low) and TX fees (through the roof to cover missing revenue from selling bitcoins).
The former is a decision that can be taken directly by the miner, so is much easier to cut back on. The latter is the literal price of transactions (minus bitcoin mined), so is much more correlated to transaction costs than the the Bitcoin price itself.

Unless you get your income in BTC, who would ever agree to renting in BTC? If the market spikes by 100% in a week, congrats your rent just doubled..

It's extremely easy to give objects in space a nudge. If that object weighs millions of tonnes and requires interplanetary dv (quick research indicates 5k+ for the asteroid belt) to get into earth orbit, that nudge won't accomplish didly squat without a lot behind it.
For example if you strapped one of musks imaginary bfrs to that asteroid fully fuelled, would it accomplish even 1dv change? Doubt it

Dollars/Euros/Pounds etc etc, Gold, overseas assets..
As a store of value Bitcoin outperforms bolivars, but so does almost every other thing in the world.

scenarios leading to the US dollar overnight losing all value likely correlate with mankind getting bombed back to the stoneage. You might lose a few % over a month, but that's about it.

You're comparing mountains to molehills. 
Put it like this: the decline in the pound caused by the brexit vote, one of the largest political shocks in decades? I can count at least 5 hours in the last 24 hours in which bitcoin high and lows matches that variation.
If you have 5 dollars today, tomorrow you will be able to buy lunch short of an apocalypse. If you have 5 dollars worth of bitcoins today and hold it, by tomorrow you might have 10 dollars worth of bitcoins or a dollars worth of bitcoins

In a scenario where bitcoin runs the economy, most assets decline over time relative to Bitcoin. Why would anyone invest in those assets in that sceanrio?
Deflationary currency being popular to hold doesn't mean it's good - it's exactly rhe reason it's bad.

Source? [Some estimates of Bitcoin's energy consumption reach 57TWh now]( and the [entire US power consumption comes to ~3,900TWh]( I'd be really surprised if the US uses 1.46% of it's entire annual energy consumption on Christmas lighting..


The world wastes 5,700 TWh of electricity (~26% of world energy supply I think?!?) on 'step down converters'? Unless you're including lost electricity in the networks connecting Generators to homes I don't see how you got to this figure. Even then that'd be a stretch unless you're also including waste heat in the generators as well...

ok I'm not an expert at all but after some quick googling:
According to blockchain.info, estimated ~25m TH/s network capacity. Antminer S9 is quoted at 100W / Th/s 
25*(10^6)Th/s *100w * 365 *24/(10^12) = 22TWh (annualized, at current hash rates).
So even if we take a modern miner (marketing states most efficient in the world, I'm assuming it's at least decent) and give that to all hash rate AND assume the manufacturer's rating holds across all these miners in all conditions and ages and quality of electricity supply we arrive at a figure of ~40% of the digiconmist forecast.
This seems like a very optimistic methodology and even then It's not really the two orders of magnitude we'd need to make your statements work.

there's any number of triangles you can draw which would get different conclusions; on this particular one the two lines aren't even on the same time period.
It's very easy to draw lines after the fact to match to what happened and say this would have predicted everything, but to predict for the future isn't so easy.

How much of that demand is because Bitcoin is thought to be going up in value? You have no guarantee of increased demand without it being useable for day to day transactions with little volatility.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:17:18


how so? Investing in index funds or ISAs or pensions is very accessible. You might not be able to invest a big lump sum and hence gain big returns, but that won't be solved by letting the rich get rich by simply having a bitcoin wallet

I mean one could draw a line from 20k and say everything is fucked. Or you could draw a line from 2015 and say 1m is for 2018. Drawing lines is meaningless.

How is that a necessary outcome of inflationary currency?
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:47:36
Bitcoin takes up electricity comparable in scale to the UK (according to quick googling, ~40TWh-50Twh/yr or ~15% of UK electricity demand), and that's with &lt;1% adoption rate. You can offer as many counter examples as you want, I sincerely doubt that they'll in aggregate add up to enough electricity to run a modern industrialized medium sized nation AND have not even started mass adoption yet.  
Edit: I'm kind of assuming consumption will go up with adoption rate, guess that's not guaranteed - I'll have to look into whether it will scale linearly or better/worse.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:13:48
Why would that be the case? Deflationary currency makes sitting on a pile of cash a viable-best investment strategy - something those at the bottom are definitively unable to do.

inflation rate of ~6.6%?

More miners being viable = more work being done to mine block that doesn't result in a block being found = more energy usage surely?


I'm not sure how much extra benefit comes from bitcoin mining vs other uses of hardware for research - but surely  such research will take years to come to fruition, whereas more miners setting up in the event of price spiking is relatively quick.

How many GWh are used for christmas lights a year?
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:35:09
Well surely mining is related to price right? and if adoption goes from &lt;1% to 100% who knows what happens to the price.

I'd rather try investing in index funds without a bankaccount than investing in bitcoin without a bankaccount!

A lot of the alternatives these people moved to are getting stomped down and preventing from providing competition (eg subscribe star having it's infrastructure pulled)
I think it's one thing when a consumer facing organisation has these policies, but when what is essentially essential infrastructure to commerce on the internet starts blocking customers for political views you have a real problem.
