He's the one with ETH, I have OMG lol. Fuck me.
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:04:54
Me too, and with fees, so ended paying like 7800...
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:56:25
But I am a dumb person. I bought to trade, changed to altcoins (with the intention of changing back to btc) and now none of them are recovering.
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:44:13
You are right. I tried before with flights and didn't show the option, but for hotels is showing.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:09:14
Now I will change dumb to unlucky: one of them really recovered a lot (SIB), but since I put the limit too low, didn't manage to get all my btc back, when it was actually possible.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:02:19
Much profit. Many coin.

Third world country, pay market price + percentage (I guess is normal when p2p).
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:24:56
At least you didn't put it in OMG... I am losing money by the minute.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:37:08
Does it steal my ETH?
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:32:55
Do you know if is possible to send from a bittrex address to a wallet with segwit?
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:29:02
I hope not... But I think ETH will recover, at least 350 after the fork. The problem is what will be BTC value after the fork...
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:01:36
SIB (it changed now and I missed the chance to recover it all because put limit too low, it's a weird coin...), DASH, and ARK.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:28:40
You were sick of checking and decided to do something that makes you check continuously :P
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:05:31
Oh, my mistake then, thought would be between 6100 and 9900.
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:26:37
I looked for it and didn't show up, think is maybe a regional feature?
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:23:14
And why you didn't tell me then? You owe me some satoshis now.

There's an ["official" wallet]( 
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:47:40
@_date: 2017-10-28 01:21:33
Thanks for your kindness!
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:44:39
The fork.
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:00:55
Think about a safe. There is a difference between having the safe and the keys at your house or having your money in someone's else safe.
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:58:09
I am just a simple guy... maybe ask in ? But it seems will recover after the low (that means, personally I think it's a good time to buy). You missed the drop to 280!
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:55:13
@_date: 2017-10-25 13:18:55
Yo don't own the keys = you don't own the bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:22:18
[This one?]( 
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:02:12
Or they can keep the new coin after a fork.
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:23:50
Yes.
