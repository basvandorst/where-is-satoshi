What a dumb fool. Like if you’re on tv talking about finances, even if you know nothing about bitcoin, you’d think you’d understand it’s concept of supply

I'm relatively new to crypto, so it may just be me but, this is so counterproductive for crypto as a whole. If we want mainstream adoption we can't have petty shit like this happen. For the regular person just getting into crypto it's already confusing, then you add in bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold, bitcoin whatever, not to mention hundreds of other Alts. It's like if we all worked together we could accomplish amazing shit. But nah let's attack the main coin that is the only reason bitcoin cash exists... makes sense. Smh

I hate you for having logic and an opinion

Fuck the title was scary for me. I thought banks were closing accounts cause deposits and withdraws using bitcoin apps and sites at first. Yeah screw this financial system, they've had us as slaves for too long.

I'm in the same boat buddy. Personally I am paying back slowly rather than all at once. A little each month.

Guys I'm newer to crypto and bitcoin, this drop is normal it seems from the comments? Can somebody please explain it to me a bit better? Just a noobie trying to learn. Thanks 
@_date: 2017-09-02 05:53:47
Thank you. I appreciate the time you took to comment and help me understand better.

Japan's flag reminds me of a girl's period. I just realized that. Or is it just me? 
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:29:44
Thank you. This helped me out. I'm new, got in last week. I was panicking today with the drop but the sub helped me hold or should I say HODL. See I'm learning haha. Thank you for the insight and help. People on here have made this experience way better and exciting. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:53:45
Thank you bossman. You honestly helped me

1000 bucks for a phone?! God damn... when did we let this start to happen? 
@_date: 2017-10-08 06:07:55
