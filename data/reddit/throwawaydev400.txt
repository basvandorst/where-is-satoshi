The chance of a person possessing those skills together with the personality traits and life situation that let him pull through with something like creating bitcoin are extremely low. 
We are talking one in a billion here. The world won the lottery when it comes to Satoshi.

Agreed, no one else comes anywhere close as a likely Satoshi candidate imo.

You probably have a good legal case, and its because of situations like this that I highly doubt that bfx ever will open again. Personally I'd like the whole haircut and continuation to happen, but it just doesn't seem possible that it would be legal. 
The wise thing is probably to treat bfx like another gox, with some % being paid out years later after bankruptcy and prosecution of owners and such.

It is very healthy to shake out many of the useless/scammer alts. Do you think there is a use for 100 different alts with a market cap of over 50 million? Or over 500 different coins with a market cap of over five million? It is obvious that the vast majority of these aren't used and never will be used. They only cause bad incentives where bad actors try to bamboozle people into pump and dumps. Alts as a whole still have a very long way to fall before the bear market is over, and the market will be a lot more healthy and ready for the next bull run once all that dead weight is gone.

It is quite obvious that people offering this would have inside knowledge and experience that tells them that this will make them a killing. This leads me to believe the payout will be at least 25% for these people to bother given inflation and other discounts they have to factor in,  likely a fair bit more.

I bought in with a very small stake at $100 and saw the rise to $1200, only to buy much more at $800, $600, $500, $400 and $300 on the way down. It seemed insane but I still did it. Basically all my saving went to BTC and I didn't tell people around me. Things were looking grim with six digits in the red at the worst point, but now I am in the green by a LOT. :)

I think so, but it is impossible to be sure.

You can keep the majority of your coins in safe cold storage while trading on an exchange as if you used your entire stash(for example only trading with 10% of your stash and using 10x leverage when doing so). The most important reason is probably that it makes things more exciting and more of a gamble though.

After the fact explanations like that are useless.
China pushed it even higher three years ago without that. If the people that writes those articles knew anything they would not be writers, they'd be full time traders.
@_date: 2017-01-02 21:51:12
If the facts causing the rise are easy to see, why not act on them before the price movement instead of writing articles about them? And why was the bitcoin price even higher before without the capital controls?
It is easy to speculate about plausible reasons after something has happened. It's not helping anyone though, and it certainly doesn't mean the article is right. It's especially annoying in the case of ZH where they do in in a snarky know-it-all way, where their expertise obviously isn't there.

Zero hedge is the masters of retarded "x asset went up/down because of y" commentary. The y reason is picked by rolling a dice, and some edgy know-it-all wording is added and boom, the article is done.

It will be a big crisis when people and corps realise the debt will default(the debt is so high that sales of new bonds can’t pay back the interest of the old ones, which will inevitably happen in a situation of ballooning debt like we have now). This means the government bonds will be worth nothing, and people and corps won’t give new loans to the government. 
In that situation the government can try to increase taxes by a lot in order to keep paying off the interest, but this would lead to capital flight and reduced economic activity. Another thing they can try is to increase inflation by a lot to devaluation of the debt through inflation, but this also causes capital flight and other problems. It is inevitable that the us government and economy will go through a rather large restructuring. The same is true for parts of Europe too, so it is not just the US that will go through big upheavals.
The timing is hard to get right though, if you short the economy now and the crisis ends up happening 10 years from now you’d go bankrupt many times over.

historical trends don't guarantee future performance, but old spike were something like $30, $270$ $1200 $2000. Those are *5 to *10, which makes 100k look possible.

Making your debt go away with inflation is technically not defaulting, but it would make it next to impossible to find any new lenders after doing that, so it has a similar result.
Your second point is a good one, and it is often overlooked by doomsayers like me. There is an answer though, and that is that most of the world also is running with an increasingly accelerating monetary expansion. Europe isn't exactly better than the US, and China complicates the situation even further with literary millions of people that desperately want their life savings out of the country. 
There's another piece to this puzzle which is demographics. This is a touchy subject, but whites are the only large group of net tax payers in the US. With a birth rate below replacement among whites and a continued immigration of net tax beneficiaries things are looking grim. An example of a much more accelerated prooblem like this can be found in Greece, where their debt as a percentage of GDP is three times larger than the US, and they have a birth rate of 1.3.(their population will be half as big in 50 years, with a large number of retirees). Greece keep getting loans from the EU for political reasons, but that can't go on forever. The US is not quite in the same position as Greece yet, but there's no sign for a change in these trends.
I wish I was smarter, because there's a lot of money to be made here if you understand these things and can get the timing right. What I do understand though is that the debt can't increase forever and exponentially like it looks like it does currently.

Fiat withdrawals are disabled there, so anyone that needs cash are forced to buy bitcoin, withdraw them and send them to another exchange for getting dollars. This distorts the bitcoin prive upwards on bitfinex, and theoretically downwards on all other exchanges. The situation is very similar to the one in China, except being the opposite(they can withdraw yuan, but not bitcoin from exchanges). 
The true price would be an index of exchanges that allow both bitcoin and usd withdrawals, like coinbase, kraken or bitstamp.

Does artificially propping exports up mean the economy is healthy though? It only serves to move resources from non-export industries to export industries. Money gets shuffled around but there are losers as well as winners (in this case the losers are more "hidden" as it mostly comes through a general loss of purchasing power. 
You could actually argue that the situation is worse than zero sum, as it prevents market efficiency- investment goes to industries that are artificially and temporarily propped up and not to where it is most efficiently used.
@_date: 2015-03-12 12:35:38
There's a gain for people exporting, but it is paid for with a general loss of purchasing power due to the weaker exchange rate. It's basically shuffling money around. The place where the money is taken from is less directly visible though, which explain why it's such a popular measure by politicians.
@_date: 2015-03-11 20:10:59
It increases exports for some, but takes away production elsewhere(and reduces purchasing power for Europeans). There's no net gain for the world as a whole.

No you can't do that on any serious exchange.
