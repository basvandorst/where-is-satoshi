They've been accepting BTC for a while now. Just wanted to share :) happy botting!

Where did the BTC go? As you can see, some people received their withdraws but some did not. Those who didn't were listed as undefined and I've confirmed with them (myself included) that we did not receive the withdraws. Any help? Has this happen to anyone before?

Yes basically we have the group already formed from the previous KNC Group Buy. We are buying the new limited to current KNC Customers - KNC Neptune. We are selling it by shares. 
Current Market Values: 1 Neptune = 857 Shares = ~3000 Gh/s = $10200 = 10.2 BTC @ 1 BTC = $1000 1 Share = ~3.525 Gh/s = $12 (Paypal / Cash for Current Group Members only) .25 BTC = 21 Shares = 74 Gh/s

Please note that the listed prices are estimated at 1 BTC = $1000 (if BTC changes it will be adjusted accordingly in BTC, I will front some BTC to cover for the payment and charge you later to save time for ordering!). If BTC goes up you will be reimbursed.
Current Market Values:
1 Neptune = 857 Shares = ~3000 Gh/s = $10200 = 10.2 BTC @ 1 BTC = $1000

He won't be able to withdraw the money until I confirm that I've received the item.

Yes I am using the latest armory. I have 16GB Ram. I had 8GB Ram then I added another 8GB. I don't remember if it's before or after I installed armory. But it was near each other :/

I backed up with a paper wallet and a digital back up as well in that appdata/armory folder. With the backup I will be able to restore the wallet and the address created in there right?
Fixed it. Reinstalled and deleted everything from username/appdata/armory one of the wallet file was corrupted. Lucky thing I backed up digitally and with paper wallet.
