Its more that they want certain companies like Netflix to pay to get "full speed" (or better QoS) on their networks.  What this means of course is the "next netflix" which also would need similar performance will never get off the ground.  While Netflix seems to oppose this, they have recently had to give in on some fronts to maintain their quality.  Honestly though, in the long run something like this could benefit Netflix because again, it would keep (new) competitors out.

True... but from what I figure, they'd need to transmit just the header to "prove" a valid block.  The full block would have to match the merkle root that is in the header, but making a fake block in this way would take as much hashing as a real block.

Just to add to the other explanations, the way transaction malleability actually happened in most cases was, there's at least two ways to say "the next N bytes are the signature" in a transaction, so if you switch methods the transaction is not the same hash-wise but results in the same transfer of bitcoins.

In my opinion, Dogecoin will get a group that might have been more difficult to reach into cryptocurrencies.  Since it embraces its position as "funny money" or whatever you want to term it, you get the people who can't take this new form of money seriously interested.  They see people tossing it around like its mostly worthless, but they see from the bot messages or from getting involved that it is at least worth a little bit of real money.  In this way I can see Dogecoin as a valuable stepping stone, for those who just can't at first accept that this thing that someone invented is now worth "real money".

In fact, fanatical is one of those things they can attempt to paint us in the negative.
For me, I've always been one to talk about stuff "around" bitcoin, such as - when credit card theft comes up, talk about how the "security model" works for standard transactions.  I try not to sound like I'm talking directly about how shitty the current systems are, because a decent explanation will have others realizing that themselves.

The only real reservation I have is that it may cause more people to think that Bitcoin is a company.  I suppose it could be branded as "reddit Bitcoin community" or something similar to distinguish.

To add to this, if you use something like Armory (which uses bitcoin-qt as its relay) and you manage to craft a transaction with too low a fee, your own bitcoin-qt client will disconnect armory for trying that transaction.
I think there is a branch of the bitcoin-qt client that completely removes the minimum fee but again, relaying that transaction would probably be difficult/slow

Well, he kept enough info out of his communications that there's nothing that can be done to forcibly prove its him aside from searching his computers (something that I doubt people here would support for any reason), and then only if he left anything identifying him on them.  Otherwise, the way would be for him to sign a message from the genesis block key, or the one he was know to use for communications, something he'd have to do voluntarily.
I think most people here will support the effort of a person to not be tied to their online identity if they choose to try to protect it.  Also, previous articles were MUCH more speculative.

Keep in mind that the way transactions work, you have to spend the full output(s) (not necessarily all the coins in the address) at once, so even if you are only really spending a small amount, you can still destroy a lot of days, even if you send the change to the same address.

If this is the same one I'm remembering, you give them your wallet and an idea of what the passphrase is, and they try a bunch of things - misspellings, letter substitution, adding punctuation, etc.  It usually takes several days even with a good idea of what the passphrase is.

That would work if they never in that time period noticed their balance dwindling or did any sort of consistency check vs their database

@_date: 2016-09-18 08:16:16
He means cost of lost block rewards.  If I'm reading correctly basically:
1. Wait until transaction is considered locked in
2. bribe miners which mined the blocks since you sent the transaction
3. miners re-do work starting on the block before the transaction was confirmed, with a different transaction this time
So the miners lose the block rewards they already worked for, if/when the new chain overtakes the old one
@_date: 2016-09-18 17:36:06
It's not just about your block but the ones on top of it (the later 5 for the usual 6 confirmations)
Really though you don't necessarily need support from anyone who mined blocks since your transaction, just enough to outpace the other chain.  Realistically though that would involve some pools which mined blocks in the old chain.

Basically they listen for transactions but don't relay the ones they are making (the high fee ones).  If a new block is found by someone else, they start trying again, putting their "private" transaction in again.
If I'm thinking correctly this can be very risky... another pool could just pull the transaction details from the block and try to orphan the block that they just mined.  Or is there some detail not revealed for transactions already in blocks?

When you first use an address you expose the public key (the address is derived from this key but its a one-way function so the actual key is not known until a transaction comes from that address).  This isn't an issue now but has been talked about as a possible vulnerability if/when quantum computing becomes a thing.  It would still take a while to break a private key from a public key but it wouldn't be "longer than it would take for the heat death of the universe" long anymore.

Transactions go out to the network immediately - if someone tries to double spend you will see it right away.  Miners will only process the first spend that propagates and reject the double spend transaction.  If you see your transaction propagate through most of the nodes AND its been more than a few seconds (for you to see if a double spend is trying to propagate) then you should be safe.

This for now is to keep the blockchain from getting too big too fast, while they have not yet implemented some optimizations
The number of transactions per block has an upper limit, but its possible to reach 1MB with less than that many transactions


When you send bitcoin, you have to spend an input.  So if you are sent 1 bitcoin and 2 bitcoin, and need to pay 1.5 to someone, you spend the 2 bitcoin input, giving yourself .5 as change and 1.5 to the other person.  If you need to send 2.1, you need to spend both inputs, which makes the transaction take more space.  If originally you had received one transaction of 3 bitcoin, the 2.1 transaction would take exactly the same amount of space in the blockchain as the 1.5 transaction.

Blockchain is not a typical web wallet - usually web wallets manage the addresses/keys themselves and you don't get them.  Blockchain lets you generate the keys etc, and stores an encrypted file which they don't have the password for.  You get the file when you enter your identifier and the password you enter decrypts the file (password is not sent to their servers).
@_date: 2013-04-24 06:05:51
Blockchain.info stores an encrypted blob (optional second passphrase for private keys).  Agreed not better security but no worse than keeping encrypted copies yourself lying around.  Though it does have 2 factor which means if you get key logged for your password they will need to get your file from one of your backups or something.
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:53:36
I'm generally against anything sensitive going over email.  If something were to happen that made you release your decrypt keys, there's probably going to be a bunch of people who still lose their money because someone gathered up a bunch of encrypted xprivkeys from welcome emails...

The 4.5 one has the worst GH/s/$, just fyi.  Though people are talking about being able to "overclock" it (it uses the same chip as the other units, just less of them, and it's downclocked so it can be powered off USB and not need a fan)

And even for those who invested early, most did not put on the order of hundreds, heck even tens of dollars maybe into it, but if they are still buying, they are now.  I know people say "if only I had invested early" but really, would you have dropped $1000 on something worth less than $1?  maybe I would have mined, sure, but I wouldn't have put more than $50 into it I'd think.
That being said I still think we are in a "can't stay here" area: still too small to compete seriously.
@_date: 2013-04-25 23:51:09
I don't see the risk though.  The price is 'locked' for 15 minutes while bitpay waits for the transaction to be sent.  The merchant is guaranteed the price they set.  Isn't the point of bitpay to eat the risk?

If they get too much share of the network hashrate, concerns could be raised about security, which would hurt the value of what they are doing.
@_date: 2013-06-11 17:18:10
One thing I think with this 51% attack... by forking, the person/group has kept the difficulty artificially low by basically invalidating the rest of the network's hashrate instead of adding to it.  Guess this could be the "economical" way to do a 51% attack without just staying legit.

@_date: 2013-04-26 03:14:19
It seems the early units will be like this.  They are using the old boards which have too many power issues for the higher hashrate units, but are low enough for the 5GH.  I wonder if they will keep doing 2 chips with the new boards though.

I remember thinking similar when there was the stories about paypal "considering" bitcoin as a funding option - paypal is basically proxying any number of funding methods and likes to use the lowest fee one so their profit margin is the highest.  They really like ACH transfers over CC funding (if coinbase's fees are to be believed, its only $.15 for one).  Bitcoin would be another low-fee option that they would still take their normal fee out of, giving a good margin.
@_date: 2013-07-28 16:10:41
He's thinking people will be looking up their own addresses to check this out
@_date: 2013-10-21 17:54:58
Somewhat true.  They use an external service to verify your identity, which you give your SSN (or was it last 4 digits?).  I don't think they get a copy of this info.
The Visa card is, as I'm reading their blog, to facilitate the instant transfers and increase the instant limit in the future.  My reading of it is that, if you do an instant buy, the ACH doesn't hit your bank right away and its possible you won't have sufficient funds when it does, and this would result in you having up to 10BTC without paying.  The CC is a fallback in case this happens.
I imagine any system that must integrate itself with the current banks would want to gather this info, even without KYC/AML rules, to shield themselves from fraudulent charges and chargebacks.

I'd think the best way would be for the user to show their address to the machine via phone display or printout, instead of the machine generating the keys...
@_date: 2013-10-21 16:48:18
blockchain.info and coinbase work in significantly different ways:
blockchain.info keeps an encrypted file, which you decrypt in your browser, with javascript.  The password is your encryption (2nd password too if you use it, on your private keys only).  The javascript of blockchain.info is basically a 'lite' local wallet with an encrypted wallet file stored in the cloud.  Blockchain also has some protection against your file being downloaded by people other than you, though with a good enough password that should not matter.
Coinbase is a hosted wallet, they have the keys and everything.  You'll notice if you deposit anything into a wallet like coinbase that the deposited coins don't stay long in the address you send them to, they get forwarded into a main wallet for the site.  When you withdraw you'll get coins from different addresses each time (most likely).  Your balance is kept in their database.

I don't really think that this should be one over the other, and also, I think having more cash out options are what will attract more merchants.  While we want to get to the point where businesses don't have to cash out to operate, right now making this transition as easy as possible will allow the end goal to be achieved more quickly.
Basically, we want to have the argument for adopting bitcoin be, at the very least (disregarding all other benefits), its really easy to do and you can keep operating just like you were before without doing much.  Once enough places are converted, via promise of less fees or the above "why not its so easy" attitude, then places can start to keep the bitcoins and use them directly for operations.
That sounded better in my head (as most things do) but basically, by making BTC--&gt;fiat (and back) easier, businesses will be more likely to start accepting them in the current situation, which will hasten/increase the chance of "the bitcoin economy"

I heard/thought about this about a week ago, all you really need to do is use the 2nd password function so your private keys are behind a password that isn't saved.

Not even that.  Its the classic DRM problem, how do you secure something that you have to display to them?  Even if the file is only sent/stored encrypted and decrypted in memory, you still have an encrypted file and the server is either sending the key or its a static key embedded in the program.
Do they even encrypt things?  I'm thinking you could probably just find the file if you killed the app fast enough after opening a picture.

Not exactly.

Harder. I'd be worried about ASICminer if there wasn't someone else making ASICs though, but even then, they are interested in profiting from Bitcoin, not disrupting it.
@_date: 2013-03-08 04:09:38
I like how he mentioned mining moving to "specialized hardware"
Before reading this I was thinking that ASICs would make Bitcoin seem less... unreal, in the sense that people could just leave their computers on and get free money.  I know this isn't actually the case with mining of course, but it is a perception, something that isn't quite fully shaken even after learning the details of mining.  I'm glad they are coming at a time when buying Bitcoin is a more realistic option anyway.
@_date: 2013-03-05 05:47:51

I'm referring to some comment, that was probably here or may have been elsewhere, I honestly forget.

Not a solution but at least somewhat more protection (of course this is all security is, reducing risk never actually getting rid of it completely)
IMO they should require email authorization if you don't have 2FA, then spin 2FA as more secure AND more convenient! Point 2 would probably be why most people actually enable it.

I know that feel
Mid 2011 at the latest (judging by mtime) I had installed the client on my old computer, except I didn't understand how transaction processing worked and thought I'd just get fees for transactions that passed through me.  I had an ATI card too, which I find out recently can do about 97mh/s.
When I found the old wallet, I opened it but knew before even transferring it that I hadn't gotten anything.

True, though I'd point out that their plan probably couldn't account to human greed enough.  Someone on the project could steal the coin directly or skim some of the hash rate etc.  Bitcoin would need to be a decent percent of total USD circulating before I'd even think this would be considered.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:36:45

Asking to work with the regulators isn't bowing down.  They wanted a point to start from.

Not 100% sure on this, I think you'd be able to send a new transaction without a lock time.  I think the nLockTime makes it so the transaction is considered invalid until its after the specified time.

Accept them and look - I forget where it was posted - for a place which lists businesses that accept bitcoin.  It'll be nice free advertising there, and you'll probably get a little more business you normally wouldn't have just for your support.
@_date: 2013-07-14 17:06:58
They don't want to go above ~35% of the network (maybe it was 40%) so if they have extra equipment, they could rent it until they need it.
They sell a lot of excess but it could make sense to keep some in case of faster than production speed difficulty increase.
That said, I'm not convinced they are doing this.

I'm hoping it has something to do with BTC payments being used in countries not served by Paypal etc (where people tend to have less money to spend on luxuries)

Its true creating a new coin is pretty easy, getting people to start mining it would probably be hard as they know what they mine now has value and the new coin might never get off the ground.  Then you have to get exchanges to start using your coin.  At that point at least your coin could be traded against bitcoin and might have some value.  THEN you need people to actually start taking it as payment.  Technically this last step isn't needed but the value of your coin will probably stay low without it...

You'd need most nodes to change, not just miners.  Full nodes will still reject things that don't follow the rules even if they have most of the hashing power.
Also you could put it in a client with a time delay to five everyone a chance to update before it's enabled.
@_date: 2013-03-04 19:26:48
Am I the only one who thinks someone may have gotten (or come close to getting) over half the network hashrate and hid it because they had no interest in disrupting the bitcoin network, and just wanted to mine tons of coins?
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:09:20
Amazon did something like that, although its a "coin" in name only, its issued/destroyed by them, so its more like MS points, Riot points, or [insert F2P MMO money] points.  I don't see why a company wanting to issue a currency they endorse as "theirs" would try to go decentralized, and even if they want to they'd probably be rejected outright as a scam.  You've seen the animosity to Litecoin, and that doesn't have any "taint" like this.
As for the moat... its mostly the infrastructure around it I'd say, stuff like blockchain.info, the mining pools, and the number of businesses accepting it.  That said there is nothing preventing a company from taking multiple cryptocurrencies if something like bitpay existed for them.
Also, I don't see those big payment processors staying out of the game forever, but again I doubt if they started their own coin it would take off.  Most likely they will build on top of the Bitcoin network and make their own money in conversions or something similar.

To put a reason behind this, a passphrase on a wallet means you have a (assuming no faulty RNG) good private key, that is, it has the appropriate amount of randomness to make it harder to just stumble on.  A brain wallet generates that private key from the passphrase, its not just encrypting something with that phrase.  So generally you wind up with something thats a lot less random than it seems.  There are plenty of people out there who are constantly scanning addresses that correspond with certain phrases (long quotes from books etc).
@_date: 2013-05-05 07:17:52
The way I see it, the coins were accepted as valid without doing some sort of double spend (which in my mind isn't really a counterfeit, just tricking someone into thinking you sent the money when you didn't).  So, the person briefly had a ton of bitcoins that should not exist, but were recognized as valid by the system.
@_date: 2013-04-26 06:56:04
Are the headers really that big? Considering there would be roughly 1/4 the number of transactions per block, but with 4 times as many blocks per unit time... that means there's only 4x the block overhead, which shouldn't be too high.

This is what I'm hoping for mostly - "everyone" will have one, the power to turn on the SHA portion of the chip won't be too much more than just having your computer on (and probably wouldn't impact performance).
I'm almost thinking someone may have helped this idea along (ie they were considering some security module, and a "gentile" influence was applied to make it the SHA256 one) (a person can dream)
@_date: 2013-03-29 17:39:39
Ah I see.  I was taking it as they were over power budget and it was scaling mostly on number of chips.  Makes sense that when they said the chips weren't the culprit... 
Well that's good news anyway.  Maybe its just a bad clock circuit or something.

True... I should have clarified more on this, I'll post again some time in the future when I put dates on the X axis (see other comment).

Merge mining even just namecoin would get them +~6% according to dustcoin.  They should try out mining at mmpool since it gives them even more things to merge mine (and supports changing share difficulty, something they definitely need)
My understanding of merge mining is it adds a lot of bloat to the coins that support merged mining, because the non-merged-mining coin (Bitcoin) transaction log gets stuffed in there as "extra data", but the Bitcoin blockchain gets very little extra data (one small entry... I forget where).
The main problem for ASICminer is that they'd easily get over 50% of the other coins' hashrate.  I'd still say they should try it with a small part of their hashrate, as an experiment, on mmpool or something similar.

It doesn't happen much anymore but sometimes they will put up that they must do "at payment received" pricing (instead of just disabling trading).  When this happens orders are cancelable until they actually go through instead of the normal few minutes.

I saw both statements... One seems to suggest they will ship 2 fully populated units at lower clock/power to compensate, but I think a more realistic situation would be them shipping out 2 half-populated units at full clock/power.  They promise to hit the hashrate you ordered, I don't see why they would throw twice the chips they needed to at the problem to do it.
@_date: 2013-10-21 16:40:43
Close to what you are asking, if you are in the US, is coinbase.com.  It primarily uses ACH transfers (same method as PayPal "instant bank transfer").  You can't get it instantly from them at first, but a month you can get up to 10 a day instantly.

scrypt was designed to, supposedly, make it ASIC-resistant since it requires a lot of memory lookups.  The memory required fits in modern processor's L2.

You shouldn't be looking for a way to block bitcoin mining specifically.  If some malware is getting bitcoin mining on your machine, its probably getting a keylogger and who knows what else on there too.  Get rid of the actual malware.

Not quite.  The rest of the network would still reject the chain because there is an invalid block buried in it.  Remember the fork not too long ago, the 0.8 chain was quite a bit longer than the 0.7 chain, but the 0.7 clients still rejected it because it contained something they didn't understand (and therefore it was an invalid block, much like a &gt;25 miner reward block would be)

Assuming you are talking about coinbase, this is because that's how long a bank transfer takes to clear.  After they "know you" for a while they will do a certain amount of instant transfers (speed of PayPal).

But also dropped the minimum output requirement

Ah okay so its the 2nd case then.  I didn't really panic but figured someone might have my encrypted wallet file for later brute forcing (which by length should keep it safe, but if a segment of my pass got into a dictionary somewhere might be crackable in less than a lifetime).
I thought I'd either:
* change alias, move coins from all addresses to new keys (so bruteforced wallet file wouldn't have coins left on the addresses the attacker got to)
* Move most of my coins to local storage (Small truecrypt volume auto-backed up)
I went with  but will probably put a bit back up on blockchain.  Just not my 'main savings'

That's a pretty sweet deal since they do the processing.  Does bitpay do something similar?

Well I didn't get actual block times for past blocks so the orange line to the left would shift a bit, though from an initial look not much after the reward halving.

Rhawk was talking about unlocking the wallet file, which is not the same as bruteforcing the private key.  That said, it works both ways - he could be using a password that would take even longer to crack.
I like that image though - was looking for it a while back when someone I was helping get into BTC asked about collisions.

Very nice!
2 suggestions:
* links that preserve settings (for sending to others)
* different sound effect (and perhaps more distinct look) for trades (lighter sounding maybe since they usually go off rapid-fire)

Good to know.
If the dev doesn't already have an order with BFL/Avalon, its going to be quite a while until they get their hands on anything to test with (and probably still will be even if they do have an order).  Maybe Luke will be willing to "share" his dev unit.

Serious question, is the stuff primecoin finds actually useful? From what I read it's some sort of prime chain, not new primes though?

@_date: 2013-04-25 23:03:04
It looks like a lot of these cases arise from the philosophy "if you can code it and it works, you're done" which is mostly fine in BTC-only things, but once you start dealing with fiat you start hitting the legal issues.  I hope someone is in the process of working through the legalities of setting up an exchange that won't get closed for this reason...
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:47:52
Yea.  My strategy when "discussing" with people like this is usually to go right for their own logic, in this case: "You think its worthless, so in your mind you are giving me nothing for something.  How is this a bad deal for you?"

Most who say its a scam are saying they are not actually making the chips, just taking the money and running.  They proposed the chip pics were just of other chips, that the fab pics were fake, the tour of the lab was fake, etc...

What I'm referring to is... someone posts the price in USD and takes paypal.  When you go to pay for this, you select bank account, cc, etc and bitcoin would be added to that list.  I imagine the process from that point would look something like how sites that take bitpay work.  The seller would just get USD in their paypal account just like if you paid with ACH or credit.
Of course this is all based on some minor comment several weeks? ago where they said they were considering taking bitcoin as a funding option.  I imagine they will have most if not all the legal requirements just doing this, even if they don't do USD -&gt; BTC... so I don't see why they would include it as a funding option without the possible conversion option.
Of course you could just bypass paypal and use bitcoin directly... same can be said for those using bitpay to accept bitcoin, or paypal to accept credit cards (though that one is less simple of course)

This is just 1/(1+%increase per 2wk)^26, it does not factor in that increasing difficulty leads to more adjustments per year than 26, but its close enough.

People could pool up to test.  But also consider this could be used to break later when higher computing power is easier to come by.  Or it could be targeted (think exports)... Then the pooling to check wouldn't work.

I was about to post the same thing, about the dust.  What bothers me when people complain about it is that dust is now considered "an output that would take more than 1/3 of its value in fees to spend it" and since default fees were just reduced to a fifth of their old value, this actually lowered the minimum output size (though not enforced, in practice an output that would take more in fees to spend could be called dust).
Of course it was possible to send transactions with no fees, and that is still possible.  If a miner is accepting no-fee transactions then the way the dust calculation is set up, they won't reject anything as dust.
(Hopefully I didn't get anything wrong above, corrections welcome)
