Well, that argument goes both ways -- bitcoin without a [meaningful] blocksize limit is untried and untested too.
@_date: 2015-12-30 00:45:59


Exactly; not tx volume nor blocksize.  So stop worrying so much about the 1mb blocksize limit.  Full blocks are not going crash the price, nor drive everyone over to an altcoin.

Preserving the status quo might be a definition of conservativism.  Minimizing risk seems like another.  Punting challenges down the road in favour of the status quo seems much riskier to me.

I think your suggestion is a good one:  those who want a settlement layer have one coin, and those who want a payment network have another.
The only problem is that what already exists meets the needs of the settlement layer proponents.  How do we create an exact replica of the codebase and make it an altcoin?

The pessimism is not directed towards the supermajority of miners suddenly becoming dishonest, it's directed towards the possibility that without maintaining the right rules/limits, natural economic forces will tend the supermajority of miners towards being a smaller and smaller group.  (As pointed out, the most economically efficient arrangement would be a single miner.)

Or the blocksize stays the same / raises modestly such that wild success of a game like satoshis dice raises tx fees to the point of becoming non-viable.
Both are valid possibilities for the future.  (Not sure how familiar OP is with the blocksize debate...)

I agree that the blocksize does need to be raised, I just hold a more conservative view on the timing and magnitude of the change.  My main opinion points:
* a fee market is uncharted territory; we can anticipate that it would benefit from some further tweaks to core/xt code and enhanced wallet features.  It seems wise to engage a fee market sooner rather than later, encourage these improvements, and see how things go.
* The riskyness of increasing the block size (IMO) increases proportionally with the blocksize increase.  More aggressive proposals that imply blocksize++ is the *only* scaling mechanism we need look reckless.
I think there is a balance to be found between relying on / encouraging the development of next-layer tech (like LN), and scaling the capacity of bitcoin (blocksize++).
(Also, LN provides good incentive for non-miners to run full nodes because they need to observe the blockchain continuously in order to enforce payment channel contracts.)

I don't think anyone is trying to punish anyone else (or their ideas) here...  This is really just a question about how bitcoin scales.
Do we do it with a sense of urgency within the protocols existing mechanisms?  (I.e. blocksize limit). Or do we develop additional layers on top of the current protocol that scale its potential?  (E.g. things like the lightning network).
The former definitely provides a scaling benefit the fastest.  But the latter provides orders of magnitude better scaling and doesn't put anything about the existing protocol at risk.
FWIW, I think everyone involved in the debate has bitcoin's best interests at heart.  There may just be different timescales involved in the way each individual reasons towards their perspective.  IMO, raising the block size is at least *risky* as a complete, long-term solution to the scaling problem, so it seems reasonable to encourage other approaches to develop sooner rather than later.

^ this.
Well put.

Proprietary systems that achieve what?
@_date: 2015-11-05 23:46:44


Great question.  Why do you want raise the blocksize again?
@_date: 2015-10-13 19:04:22
This relay rule is already user-configurable; changing the default value is **not** drastic.
Wallet software that is reliant on a specific value for a *user-configurable* setting is broken.  Broken wallet software should not impact protocol decisions.
@_date: 2015-10-13 22:30:31


I'm sure you've heard the sayig that "to assume tends to make an 'ass' out of both 'u' and 'me'."  Good wallet software should not pick a tx fee (or use a fixed value for one) based on assumptions.  Doing so (and implying to the user that this guarantees success of the tx) is unsafe because bitcoin does not work this way.
@_date: 2015-10-01 00:24:56
If I understood your NACK correctly, the problem with it is that it uses circular logic and is therefore unreasonable.
objection states that in a model where miners and only miners decide the blocksize, there is no economic incentive that ensures decentralization is preserved.  It is both understandable and reasonable.  It would, however, be open for debate if you thought that in such a model there *is* an economic incentive force that promotes decentralization (?)
@_date: 2015-10-01 17:21:17
I agree, it would be bad.  But there's no disputing that it *is* possible.  Does that leave you thinking bitcoin is a bad idea?  Keep in mind that there is no way for anyone to know that such a triple-hash-power altcoin does not exist.
Bitcoin is what bitcoin does, and what bitcoin does is transfer value.  It's ability to do so is predicated on people's acceptance of it as a representation of value, not how many petahashes were used to timestamp the last ~10 mins of transactions.

Imagine that there exists today a fork of bitcoin with **triple** the mining power behind it, but only two full nodes and 17 users.  Does that now define what bitcoin is?  Or is it simply a 51% attack threat to the bitcoin that 100,000s of people use and trust?
@_date: 2015-10-01 17:07:57
Well, I think a proposal that directly favours decentralization has been missing.  (Though not for a lack of trying.)  This would be something along the lines of 'how do we incentivise/reward full node operators?
I think it's fair to say that 1mb blocks *favour* decentralization more (by constraining full-node operating costs) than 2mb blocks, but neither incentivise it directly nor indirectly.
@_date: 2015-11-05 23:35:26
Moving on to what?
@_date: 2015-10-14 20:40:55
Yes, there are several assumptions that the protocol is founded on (e.g. majority of users are good actors (or at least incapable of acting nefariously in concert), that economic incentives work, etc.).
Other assumptions, such as the minimum tx fee that will be mined and/or relayed within the network are there to be made by those who choose to do so, but they aren't necessary.  Yes, each tx must be sent with a fee; how to estimate this fee is welcome to be more advanced than using the default value for a user-configurable setting.  And going back to the original white paper, it is **not** safe to assume that a tx has actually happened until it is at least 6 blocks deep in the longest chain.
Ultimately, all I'm trying to say is that if you write wallet software, assuming a specific tx fee based on a default value has probably been fine to-date, but isn't extensible going forward.  This default value (or its *effective* value based on real-world conditions) is subject to change.  So plan accordingly, and don't pretend that this value changing is drastic.
