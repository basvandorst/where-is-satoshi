Currency is different than stock. There’s tons of information about the differences out there that people can research. If they don’t understand this fundamental difference, they should not be buying bitcoin or any other crypto currency.

Sigh. Yes, the futures market could actually totally fuck the market in the short term and maybe permanently. Get ready for a wild ride one way or another.

Exchange your currency for a foreign currency. It’s literally the same thing. There are massive unique benefits to BTC as a currency but it’s the same thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:13:37
You don’t understand bitcoin.

Yep. And if I had wheels, I’d be a wagon.

Judge the market potential based upon global currencies total value. Narrow money is around $37T. Broad money is around $90T. 
At $1MM per BTC, the value of all BTC would be $21T. That means BTC alone would have to replace the majority of the world’s money. Maybe possible in the very long term but there are competing crypto currencies too which make that unlikely.

That’s because you are comparing USD to Euro where the volatility is low. Compare USD to Venezuela bolivar. Just because volatility is similar doesn’t mean that the underlying financial asset is the same.

Try to buy toothpaste with any non-local currency. What’s your point?
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:53:27
I should say “that’s the promise the BTC hopes to solve” and that instability will eventually settle due to BTC being a global currency uncorrupted by a central bank trying to manipulate it. Volatility of BTC is a problem today for broader acceptance.

I’ve explained things to you in several threads already. 
USD, Euro, Peso, Bolivar, BTC, ETH, and so on are all currencies. They exchange on global exchange markets like currencies and volatility varies based upon a wide range of geopolitical forces.

That’s not a good way to explain currency. How would you explain Yen?

It is not a widely accepted currency but that does not negate that it is indeed a currency.

No currency has sales, profits, or assets.

Having all 21M BTC would result in the price per coin being zero. There is no intrinsic value so it would be worthless. 
I’d rather own any one of those companies in significant quantity but BTC is a fun thing to own right now.

Stocks represent fractional ownership of a company. They move based upon the performance of the company which they represent and speculation around said company.
Currencies generally move due to geopolitical forces and speculation. Crypto currency is volatile as fuck right now because it is moving, broadly speaking, on wild speculation and people misunderstanding what currencies actually do.

You lack reading comprehension.

No, currencies for the most part do not have exchange rates set by the government. There are some that do pegging but it isn’t the norm. Look at global exchange rates for currencies. They fluctuate. There is less volatility than BTC for most of them but the concept is the same.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:27:56
That’s ok. That proves there is velocity in the currency and that’s a very good thing.

“Honey, you know how we need to exchange our &lt;insert local currency&gt; to Yen when we go to Japan? Bitcoin is another form of currency. There are some technological advantages to it which is why the whole crypto currency market is hot right now. There are a lot of people investing in it like it is a stock and comparing it to companies’ valuations, but that’s not a good analogy so I want you to never think that way.”

Read the first paragraph on Wikipedia and then read the rest of the section you are trying to cite. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:56:27
But that’s not entirely true either. The bolivar is a prime example of a situation where the value has eroded but not due to the government setting the value. 
I read your prior post incorrectly. Exchange and value do have a difference. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:44:13
But that’s what BTC solves. That level of instability is why BTC is better.

And anyone that compares it to other companies also doesn’t understand it. When I see posts about the market value being higher than BofA or something it just isn’t a good comparison. Currency is different than stock.
