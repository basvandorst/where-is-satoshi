No it's more like a car and feet.

Cool. At its heart (pun), feet are a means of moving your body forward, backward, sideways and slightly up.  
That proves it dammit!

Somehow you got confused and think that Factom is StorJ ???
@_date: 2015-04-03 17:57:34
So the main beef here is that Factom is not a good StorJ implementation?  
Ay, let's continue harping on this point for many more days now shall we.  
(BTW you should probably use StorJ for your data store needs).

Sounds grand technically.  
The trick is to provide some economic incentive to the people/servers involved to keep the network running. Thus the app-coin: in short, servers get paid by the corporations using the service.  Keeps spammers out too (reddit take notice). ;)  
Otherwise sounds like you've just described Factom.

And timestamping service?  
And immutable proof-of-publication?  
And trustless global notary?  
And immutable proof-of-NON-publication?  
And decentralized censorship-resistant database?  
And likely more?

Expensive to whom exactly?  
A car is an expensive means of transportation. Most people have feet!  
Thus cars are obviously a scam.

And you don't mind the other 4-5 thousand Transactions sent within that same hour? Only these 4 annoy you?

Not misdirecting credit, not at all; I am always mindful and respectful of the  principle.  
The "anyone can do it" has been discussed elsewhere (anyone can write his own MS-Office Suite) :)  
Factom appears to have "done it" and "packaged it" and "offered it to big clients" correctly first; as a great useful service to land-registries, governments, banks, corporations &amp; dishwashers everywhere.
