That's assuming all those bitcoins are actually available. There are a lot that have been lost forever on failed hdds from early miners or were straight up written over since they were worth practically nothing at the time and was seen as nothing but an experiment. Apparently roughly 14% of bitcoins have never moved since mining, and while it doesn't mean that these bitcoins are lost, it also doesn't mean that they are available. So the 15 million bitcoins as a supply may be a bit higher than what's actually available.

Do you think a genuine bull run will happen without regular people coming in to the space?

Dang, I was late as heck in seeing this. Happy New Year!

I've been playing the HELL out of R U Mine on Rocksmith 2014. Such a badass album as a whole. Do you have any other bands you're listening to right now?
I've been listening to [Darwin Deez]( quite a bit.

It'll happen sooner or later. Like the internet. It's not everywhere yet, but it will be. Cryptocurrency (whether it's what we know it as today or not when it really explodes) is an obvious and extremely valuable invention that fills so many holes of demand currently in existence in the financial world. 
It's awesome seeing how different countries are reacting.

i want to know too.

Oh, ok. Thanks! haha, that one flew right over my head.

Coming from someone who's only ever matched with about 6 girls: :(
Good on you, though!
@_date: 2016-01-16 21:56:42
Sweet, thanks!
@_date: 2015-05-16 06:18:10
trivial is relative.
@_date: 2016-01-16 21:55:40
It's definitely the route I'll be taking. Thanks!

I do keep up with bitcoin in a general sense, such as new investments made into it, price, hashing and usage stats. Thank you for the good words!
@_date: 2015-01-02 23:58:52
Hey, thanks stranger! That was super nice of you!
@_date: 2016-01-16 21:52:33
Thank you for the comfort! I keep my eyes on bitcoin, and all the goings on with it, but I don't have as much time as I did even a year ago to keep up with the minutia (even though some of it is considered pretty massive).
@_date: 2016-01-16 21:55:07
I've looked at my investment of money (small) and time and energy in mining (no longer mining, but I was for close to a year) as a 10 year hold unless a catastrophe occurs in my life and I am forced to withdraw. Thanks for the answer!

Depending on what happens with the future of bitcoin, you could either use it as stored gold - sell bits of it for fiat when necessary, use it for everyday transactions - if bitcoin becomes adopted in a mainstream capacity, cry - if bitcoin gets pushed to the side as an antiquated tool of the past. It will likely hold SOME kind of value forever, even if it's just pennies, but depending on how industries utilize and/or arise the use of held bitcoin will become clearer. Right now it's all speculation, so you hold and watch the adoption grow around you.

logic doesn't matter in politics. to believe otherwise will just drive you insane.
@_date: 2015-03-28 23:33:39
thank you! i appreciate the insight and suggestions.

5% fee is pretty high considering the fee from the real estate agents needs to be factored in as well, but I'll have him take a look at this. thanks!
@_date: 2015-03-28 22:55:37
He found a couple of real estate agents willing to take on the challenge. I'm more concerned about what would happen after the transaction if it were to occur. I think it would be a very, very low possibility of it happening, but it's a possibility we want to be prepared for.
@_date: 2015-03-28 22:56:12
haha, no, not bitcoin exclusive. it is an option for full or partial payment, though.
@_date: 2015-03-28 22:59:35
thanks! if nothing else, we're trying to help spread awareness of its real world applications and get the idea that it's some kind of fantasy money out of the ethos.
@_date: 2015-03-28 23:28:30
how so? I'm not talking about this happening in the next year or 5. there are over 100 years for innovation to occur. I was just trying to give some shallow examples of possibilities.
@_date: 2015-03-28 22:49:29
Likely alternative forms of power such as solar will need to be a big part of the bitcoin infrastructure. If bitcoin makes it to being a major payment system globally there may even be a way to scatter the hashing throughout the population. Small devices you can buy for the cost of a lightbulb that will link to an address of your choice and perform a small amount of hashing, earning you small amounts of passive income via transaction fees. Heck, they could even put it inside of a lightbulb, since we're using those anyway. My point is, if everyone hashed a little, it would trump the few hashing a lot. Innovation will come so long as the need for it exists.
