No I wasn't. Since this attack occurred at 4 AM when I was sleeping and had long since logged out of there.

I'm out $4,000 but what else can I say to prove my case against the CEO himself? $4,000 might not seem like a lot to the wealthier folks but it is a lot to me. Why would I just sit on my Mt. Gox Yubikey that they sent me and never use it until now?  I have also sent Mt. Gox my real personal info to get the verified account so they should know me very well. The only argument I can make if this CEO keeps claiming that I didn't use my Yubikey is this:
"When you think about it, the IP address that stole my coins was from China and I am based in the US. Any half decent business would find this to be a red flag and delay the withdrawal. Maybe Mt. Gox is deliberately letting these glaring red flags slide? "

You can believe what you want but Mt. Gox has my real info from getting the verified account. $4,000 might not be a lot to some of you but it is a lot to me. I have nothing to gain from 'eroding trust in mtgox and 2fa' when I was day trading over there fairly well.
@_date: 2013-09-15 02:19:24
Yes, I have it on my Android phone. I still don't know how the culprit got through the Yubikey unless it was a Mt. Gox employee.

Google authenticator.

I still have my Mt. Gox account, my Bitcointalk account and my reddit account. Where do you guys see a deleted account? 
As for trolling campaign, you're free to believe what you want but I never wanted to give up $4,000 just to damage Mt. Gox's reputation. It doesn't do me any favors and actually harms me in the end. I left a post on bitcointalk about this:
"I never had an intention to harm Mt. Gox's reputation since their success would eventually equal to my success. I was trading on trends fairly well and Mt. Gox's volume helps a lot. Without Mt. Gox, I can't do what I have been doing so I lose out too."
My primary interests in BTCs are investment related. If I can't even trust the largest BTC exchange, there is nothing I can do investment wise with BTCs.

I'm down $4,000. I'm not sure what else I can say or show to prove my case. I've filed a police report already.
@_date: 2013-09-16 18:25:55
I don't know why people can't see my reddit account but I am still here.
@_date: 2013-09-16 15:15:05
I don't know why its 404ing, I'm still here. I can see my own profile and etc.

What do I gain from lying? Eroding people's trust in Mt.Gox at the cost of $4,000? I'm not that rich. I was day trading over there fairly well too. No other exchanges have their volume.
@_date: 2013-09-15 20:14:36
No one else has access to my Yubi key.
@_date: 2013-09-14 21:29:47
Vulnerability? Can you explain?
@_date: 2013-09-15 02:18:39
Nope, didn't use the yubikey for blockchain.info. I also always assumed the Mt. Gox yubikey could only be used for Mt. Gox.
@_date: 2013-09-15 03:56:33
I don't recall ever just letting it sit after I was finished. I also have doubts that it is from my PC because the ip address that accessed my account was from China while I'm based in the US.

How can any victims of stolen BTCs disprove this? This argument would apply to anyone who ever had BTCs stolen.

I just tried to create an API key but it asks for my Yubikey.
@_date: 2013-09-15 20:12:52
Mt. Gox has my real info when I sent it to them to have my verified account. I am out $4,000 and have nothing to gain from damaging Mt. Gox's reputation. 
@_date: 2013-09-15 02:19:57
I have to thank you all for your support. You have been far more responsive than Mt. Gox have been.

With only access to get_info and trade, the bot can't make withdrawals. Also anyone can take a look at the bot's source code in the link. I really doubt its the bot.
"It's even better if the exchanges requires a positive click in a confirmation email in order to finalize a withdrawal."
Good idea. A 72 hour delay from withdrawal would also save many people. It sure does seem like Mt. Gox is deliberately screwing things up on their end when they allow ip addresses from China to freely withdraw from US accounts.
