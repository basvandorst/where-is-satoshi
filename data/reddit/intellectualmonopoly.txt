Except not?  Being that they don't exist and at best litecoin ASICs will be 10x faster than GPUs.

Original post should have said 5500 Thash.  43 million is still correct.

Sorry, you are wrong.  That would mean that the bitcoin mining network is more valuable than all the coins that will ever be produced.

It would be bullshit if we saw bitcoin moving towards faster blocks.  It doesn't appear that will happen.  It is absolutely accepted knowledge that faster blocks are more secure.

The 7850, the graphics card I use, cost me $150 when i bought it 4 months ago.

A 10 minute network time will make it impossible for other planets to to use the same currency.

Some of these objections are absolutely false/dumb/lazy.
Currently the estimated hashrate for the liteocin network is 63,000 MH/s.  The most reasonable mining hardware is the AMD 7850 which gets you about 300-350 kh/s.  So we would need around 200,000 of these cards.  If the price of the cards is 150 bucks, that is **$30 million total network capital value**.  Daily cost in electricity at 10 cents/kwh is approximately $70,000.
The 5500 TH/s bitcoin network valued at the cost of the BFL Monarch would require 9,000 units, for **$43 million** and a daily energy cost of $7,500.
Hardly "many-many" times higher.
Not to mention a 200,000 GPU order will raise some eyebrows, while a 9,000 ASIC order is nothing.  Those 200,000 GPU's are currently far more widely distributed worldwide than ASIC outfits and the ongoing cost in energy is far higher.
Even if whole factories open producing ASIC LTC miners they will be only 3-10x more efficient than GPUs.  Currently Bitcoin ASIC miners are ~1000x more efficient than GPUs, purely because of differences in the algorithms.
And finally, the bullshit about "it's too complicated how will people cope with multiple prices?!" is almost too dumb to address.  Here we are using a worldwide internet currency verified by hundreds of thousands of distributed computers and people are presenting the complication of multiple prices as a serious objection?

The term is [unconscionable](
This type of contract is unenforceable.  BitBet isn't hosted on any type of Tor hidden server so it should absolutely be possible to come after them.

As I explained, the cost of hashrate between the two networks is very similar.  Nowhere near 100's of times less.
With say 25% of the network, I can execute certain attacks where I mine in secret and reverse transactions where I happen to be significantly ahead of the main network.  The chance of being ahead after 10 minutes on litecoin is simply (.25)^4, which decays rapidly.  The chance of me executing a 1 block double spend on bitcoin is (.25)^1.  Not only is litecoin 4 times safer, it is whatever hashing power the attacker has as a percentage of the network to the power of 4 safer (in this case 64 times more secure).  At every second beyond one block litecoin is more secure, and faster first confirmations make person to person transactions much more reasonable.  It is always better to have faster confirmations until stales become a significant problem..

As far as I know the 7950 was just recently dropped to $200, which gives ~$25 million in total cost, while an old busted 5830 on ebay is like $40 now.  The latter cost about twice as much energy per day to use.
