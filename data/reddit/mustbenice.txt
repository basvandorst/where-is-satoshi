What are you even talking about?
The guy who originally said “changed the goalposts” wasn’t even talking to you, &amp; moreover, it’s not even the same guy you’re currently replying to.  
He explained pretty thoroughly what his point was &amp; in response you go for the ad hominem. Nice. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 04:22:40
Yes, that was the joke
@_date: 2018-09-10 21:52:39
Oh you’re right, it’s just that I was responding to the guy that said “meaningless comparisons are what this sub thrives on”, so I thought the comparison of Bitcoin to Apple &amp; Tesla would be an obvious “meaningless comparison”, but the /s tag seems to have been necessary.
@_date: 2018-09-10 16:13:30
The joke, you seem to have missed it.
@_date: 2018-09-09 01:21:32
Do you remember when Apple was just starting out? Tesla, Google, Uber, ever heard of ‘em?  Bitcoin is literally, *LITERALLY* the exact same thing.  See you on the moon by 2019 boys.

...that’s the joke

what are you taking about, the FBI twitter forgot to say "alleged" therefore Blake will walk scot free, 
420 BLAZE IT

Dude let it go, you're grasping at straws here

That mean she’s 69% his height.  Ignoring the obvious jokes, why does he look so much more than a 31% bigger than her?
@_date: 2019-03-22 21:14:27
Right? It almost feels like an inferiority complex.  Let’s nitpick this tiny insignificant thing to make ourselves feel superior to those stupid fat Americans. 
@_date: 2019-03-22 21:41:10
Lol I realized my error after I said it.  The point still stands though, she looks shorter than 70% of his height

Reminds me of all the creeps crying foul when jailbait went down, or when that violentacrez user got doxxed, even though he seriously seems like a pedophile serial killer. 
Great causes to fight for, hating on people due to their weight, -!: underage girls.

It’s incredibly misleading when you factor in volume. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:03:57
probably around $1.50, so 30%
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:34:40
This is such a stupid discussion.  It wasn't a great analogy in the first place, and now the conversation has devolved into trying to fit a square peg through a round hole
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:25:43
I think he does. He's saying people will pay me $20,000 to buy their bitcoin.  Seems like a good deal to me.
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:46:50
You are quite daft, aren't you?
Your username is pretty lame too.
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:51:13
Right?  This should be the top comment.
I could be a millionaire but having $20 fall out of your pocket is still going to suck.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:23:12
again, I don't see how that's relevant or helpful
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:37:09
@_date: 2015-02-08 13:15:49
How dare you.
@_date: 2015-02-08 13:17:18
Or even "taping" is more common.

I find it fascinating that you are a staunch atheist but yet you still had the initiative to learn Greek and read the Bible in its original Greek language.
Personally I'm a devout Christian but I grew up Lutheran, &amp; only recently have been attending a Pentecostal church, which opened up my eyes to predestination. It scared me at first, but I have come around on it. I still am undecided what I truly believe the Bible is trying to say and I'm not sure I'll ever come to a satisfying conclusion.

Not really comparable. Amazon was solely e-commerce based.
