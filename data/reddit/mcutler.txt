1. Another tool in the quiver to help introduce complex blockchain concepts to the crypto-curious.
2. An alternate way to back up a seed phase: shade each word, draw lines with arrows between them.
3. When combined with a sufficient form of random input (combinations of dice for instance), an analog mechanism for generating new seed phrases. Proceed with caution here!
4. A simple education tool to highlight the fact that BIP39 has a much smaller dictionary than most people expect. I've yet to meet someone who isn't surprised that all seed phrases stem (see what I did there?) from such a limited set of terms.

Ah yes. This is something I wondered about, researched, and couldn't find any conclusive resources/references. Can you point me in the right/definitive direction? Not the rules per se... but technically why the rules work this way.
Here's my current (admitted limited!) understanding of how things work:
1. BIP39 provides a straightforward method for deterministically 'converting' a given private key (A) into a seed phrase (B). As in, `A → B`.
2. It doesn't take a big mental to leap to get to: `∴ A = B` and then `∴ B = A` ...so how about the user picks their own seed phrase B and then BIP39 ~~handwaves~~ will give you the corresponding private key?
3. Except it doesn't work that way... in part because of elliptic curve validation ~~handwaves~~ and in part due to the final word being part of a checksum ~~handwaves~~.
I've Googled this a bunch and found generally unsatisfying/conflicting results. This is surprising because this seems like a pretty obvious question.
Hmmm... perhaps this thread could be topic for a future Beyond Chainsplaining post? ��

Awesome. Would love to learn more about your uses... and how it goes when you try it out. Reply here or DM me. :)
