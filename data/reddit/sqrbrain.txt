"you get treatment and pay later. You don't get taken to the cashpoint in the ambulance" - that's how it happened . The govt couldn't distribute the new money to the people for months. Plus that's not the point. the point is a central authority can do whatever with your money without you having any opinion about it.
"VISA is superior to cryptocurrencies because it's there and it works, and whether or not it could have a capacity even greater than it's current capacity is irrelevant since it never touches capacity. You don't have to up the fee so they decide to process your transaction." - wtf did i just said? crypto is there and it does work and there are superior cryptocurrencies being develped which can perform far better that visa and also decentralised.
"And no, it isn't surpassing the adaptability rate of the internet. 10 million wallets after 9 years isn't mainstream. Compare it to facebook for example, they had billions of users in that time. Hundreds of time the rate of adoption." - total numbers of  blockchain wallets from the first quarter of 2014 to third quarter of 2017 is around 15 million which have almost trippled in 2018. and you dumbass compare that to the growth of internet from 1960 to 1970 and tell me the difference.
haha you are dumber than i thought. and also i noticed you hide the score till you receive 1-2 upvotes from another dumbass which proves you are a pusssssy as well.lmao

everything is a minority opinion until it becomes the majority one. And the chances of cryptocurrencies in that context is more than anything else
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:27:23
your post doesn't make any sense. centralised beats decentralised ? you mean server-client protocol beats bittorent protocol in terms of speed, anonimity,latency and single point failure? are you out of your mind? the central banking system which have history of crashing the economy is more efficient than the decentralised one? keeping your monetary assets in the hands of few centralised individual is more efficient to you? and the border argument is just stupid. yes you need fiat in every continental borders which is the hurdle cryptocurrency is trying to eliminate . Look like you don't know anything about anything 
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:13:44
"I could ask someone Indian if it's true that if you're injured in India they take you to a cashpoint in an ambulance, but I'd rather not because that sounds extremely stupid to even ask." - that's just your ignorant opinion. It has zero effects on the fact.
"Bitcoin has been available to people to mine, or even given away for free via faucets, even before the first exchanges. It has been available to consumers since 2009, and I can remember reading about people buying things with it 5 years ago. It hasn't been rapidly or widely adopted, you're kinda wrong there little guy." - i can read about people sending mails to different universities using the internet 1970. so whats your point? if you still arguing about crypto has not been widely adopted since 2009 you are just stupid. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:49:38
the data shows cryptocurrencies have far greater chances of becoming a majority thing in the future compared to the things you have just said 
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:27:40
the greek financial crisis and indian demonetisation caused turmoil in the country ,people their lives because of the mistakes of the centralised authority.They couldn't pay bills in hospitals cause they didn't accept the old notes and the banks couldn't provide the new notes. thats the whole point of decentralisation. to eliminate the single point failure. Dude how stupid you are ?
"My point regarding VISA is that its irrelevant having a network capable of handling 1 million transactions per second when the absolute peak is only 10000 transactions a second anyway. The experience to the person making the transaction is the same." - so how visa is superior to cryptocurrencies that can deliver 1mill tps?
"And it isn't surpassing the adaptability rate of the internet" - just look at the tx data from different market place and exchanges and compare that to data from 2008.
omg how stupid you are ?
@_date: 2018-01-14 14:13:13
wtf you are talking about ? the amount of online transaction done for buying goods or paying bills has increased in exponential rate since 2008. Microsoft,apple,ibm and other marketplace has starting to accept different forms of crytpos which didn't happen in 2008. dude you know nothing about anything
its not just people creating wallets . cryptocurrency exchanges have been singing up new users in terms of millions per month 
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:53:21
"Which "financial crisis where everyone lost all their money" - have you ever heard of greece financial crisis caused by centralised authority (government+banks) and the demonetisation in india created by indian government and the central bank without any prior notification and due to which several people lost their lives. Is this efficient than decentralised one?
"Even the best crypto technology could only be as good as VISA at best, because even at absolute peak it only uses about 1/6 of it's capacity - couldn't be faster really." - lol what are you even talking about. There are crytpocurrencies being developed which are capable of 1million tps . 
"And it is definitely not true that people are taking to cryptocurrencies at a rate comparable to the internet, or indeed that cryptocurrencies have the level of Government support that the internet had." - the whole idea behind crytpocurrencies is that it's a trustless peer to peer monetary system that can operate without government. But it still surpassing the adaptability rate of internet. It does not need government to operate .
please stfu dude. You are just spitting nonesense 
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:12:36
and climbs back to alt
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:23:32
great idea. i think the pirate party already supports crypto 
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:47:41
"Yes, in financial terms, having a centralized, regulated authority in control of my money is better than just trusting a decentralized system" - have you ever heard of financial crisis caused by banks where everyone lost their hard earned money ? lmao 
"VISA still beats blockchain massively by the way - a day's worth of the entirety of bitcoin transactions could be handled by VISA in about 6 seconds" - that again shows you know nothing about crytpo (may be too old to do the research or just loves to suck those bankers idk). there are next generation crytpocurrencies being developed which gonna beat visa's axx in terms of tx speed and fees.
"And bitcoin won't be borderless unless everyone accepts it everywhere which is plainly not going to happen" - again this proves you know nothing about adaptability. Yeah internet wasn't adopted by everyone when it came out. yeah you couldn't connect to everyone in 1980s. that doesn't mean it's never gonna happen. the interesting thing is that cryptocurrencies are being adopted by masses far greater rate compared to the internet itself.
to summarise - you don't know anything about anything  
@_date: 2018-01-14 13:37:41
you have an interesting point of view. either way it's gonna be good for crytpo 
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:21:19
"That's how it happened? Are you so utterly delusional people were taken to cashpoints in ambulances before treatment." - yes that's how it happened because i have relatives over there.
"The term "the internet" didn't even exist until 1974. Furthermore it wasn't initially conceived as a consumer product/ platform" - it doesn't matter how it was labelled intranet or infranet. the underlying tech is same. we are comparing tech. Cryptocurrencies are not stocks . how dumb are you to compare them to facebook or google. 
"I don't know anything about hiding scores, and don't care about upvotes" - that sounds stupid as well. the reddit's default scoring system doesn't allow hiding scores. haha
man you are stupid doesn't matter you agree to the fact or not 
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:56:36
Well, either you or your relatives are lying, kid." - ask any indians about it. looks like you are using some bs statements to disprove something but failing miserably 
"We're talking about user adoption, i.e the number of people using it, and how that grew over time. You are trying to talk about the internet before it even existed, let alone was available to consumers which is clearly ridiculous" - that is exactly what you were saying about crypto and how it's not there. Yeah its not available to the consumer via marketplaces to buy goods and pay for bills? than how could you compare that to the adoption rate of google or facebook which was available to anyone to to use anywhere. lmao you got trapped stupid kid .
@_date: 2018-12-24 18:48:59
that's my point there are already millions of public keys exposed to the public in the bitcoin network. For example the public keys held by satoshi and thousand others. And to create a new cryptographic algorithm may take several months. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:05:57
the transition gonna be really interesting if it happens 
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:16:20
that's why it makes sense to spend fiat which gonna be worth less in the future and hodl bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-25 08:57:42


I said pubkey hash of the current sender which means the bitcoin address of the sender
@_date: 2018-12-24 18:33:09
in that scenario (reversal of encryption) the whole infrastructure will fall apart..there will be no bitcoin. Why care about this tiny thing?
@_date: 2018-12-25 10:35:27
OK how does a lighting node earn money tho? By confirming transactions?
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:24:02
well that's not a good measurement to call something in a transition to revolutionise a particular sector. Look at 3d telivison or other countless examples. they never got past of that 2% adoption. Im not saying that is true for bitcoin but It still too early
@_date: 2018-12-25 09:20:30
I mean why does it even need fixing other than making it compatible for LN?
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:14:06
I can trade with other inflationary alts. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:18:15
I don't people will only have bitcoin even if they want to. cause there would be less than 21 million in circulation and  those who have lots and lots of them would not exchange it for fiat. And it Is going to increased in value as a store of value without being a successful currency 
@_date: 2018-12-25 07:56:53
the input proof must be linked to the output lock of the previous tx right? in that case a miners first look for the output lock of the previous tx, get that information(like pubkey hash of the current sender and other conditions) and validates them. In other words they validates the output lock of the previous tx as  input validation for the current tx?
@_date: 2018-12-25 09:37:40
no matter how many txs you transmit with different ids, once one is validated the others will be discarded from the mempool. It's not an issue at all. And mtgox lost money because they had a bug in their software. Other exchanges have been doing fine with malleable tx. It's similar spamming fake tx. in case of fake tx they will just get discarded and in case of malleability once a tx is validated the other fake ones will get discarded. that's it
@_date: 2018-12-25 08:07:03
thank you so much. I still have a little confusion - How the miners actually validate a tx? in my understanding they first make sure that the sender owns his public key and that public key matched to the address mentioned in the output lock of the input tx? so they get the script in the output lock of that input tx and validates those against the public key of the current tx . basically miners validate the output lock of the input tx against the current tx?
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:36:00


when I really really need to. That's a different matter. Im talking about day-day transactions

This is not a huge issue. It isn't even a issue imo..Bitcoin worked just fine with it.
@_date: 2018-12-24 18:52:47
"he primary reason is to get shorter addresses (20 bytes vs 65 bytes)"
this makes sense. thanks. Some people's ego are so massive and thinking ability is so little that they never want to  accept the fact that they might be wrong(im talking about the other guy that's commenting)
@_date: 2018-12-25 09:12:23
I disagree. once the transaction is locked in a block it will never change. all utxo must be inside the blocks of the longest chain in order to create a new tx in the first place.
@_date: 2018-12-18 09:13:59
because I have no other options. In case of currency I have a lot
@_date: 2018-12-25 09:41:36
Im okay with being wrong. Care to explain how ?

"What every node actually does is execute the script"
yes i know that. but which script. the output lock of the input tx ?
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:45:17
the difference is that i'd only sell btc when i really really need to. For example medical emergency and ran out of fiat etc. Those are rare conditions not everyday grocery spending 
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:23:39
it's not about that. When you have fiat or inflationary alts why would you spend bitcoin which demand will only grow(in a ideal situation) due to deflation.
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:55:34
that def makes sense to keep the good money but what happens to vast no of fiats. if everyone exchange their fiat with btc there must be people willing to exchange their btc to fiat. But why would anybody do that?(in a ideal situation)
@_date: 2018-12-25 10:36:12

what do you mean by second layer protection? If i have an algorithm which can generate private keys out of public keys I can basically hack the banking system by man in the middle attack, decode and hack military signals, hack every site that uses ssl to protect user authentication data and what not

Why Bitcoin should care about smart contracts anyways? It's not a smart contract platform 
@_date: 2018-12-24 19:19:15
you said a cracking encryption won't result into a chaos. which i think is totally wrong. no additional layer of security in bitcoin can prevent that because a security layer must contain encryption in order to be a security layer. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:59:02


because all we have now is fiat. The world economy must transit from fiat to crypto. In that case first people would have to exchange their fiat with btc. But why would anyone exchange their btc for fiat in the first place (in a ideal situation)

@_date: 2018-12-25 08:13:18
thats what i said. As there are thousands of tx which means there are thousands of exposed public key (coz a tx consists of a sender atleast) their public keys are exposed. Did you even read before answering 
@_date: 2018-12-24 18:50:15
I know it's called hashing. I never said it's encryption. Where did you get that ?

less than 1% of the population use crypto in day-day transactions. I'd call it a begging at 10%
@_date: 2018-12-24 21:37:29


hey, sorry  if I was rude and douchy. I disagree at the reasoning you provided. However im doing more research on it. If i find the primary reason why it's hashed is to add more security to public keys as you've mentioned I'll come back and accept your answer. have a nice day
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:39:11
I mean the ration of supply/demand is always be decreasing. And even if it doesn't have any great utility Just simply as a store of value it'll have a increasing demand.
