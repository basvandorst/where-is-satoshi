@_date: 2017-12-03 03:40:25
Yes, it will go up tomorrow i guarantee it
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:39:20
It literally just went up over 3k in 1 day. Theres going to be correction very soon..
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:51:22
Youre late as fk
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:19:51
Youre welcome
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:20:51
Yeah its going to go up from here it seems like, then crash again later. Its the same process everytime
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:35:46
Lmao this would honestly be the worst time
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:00:00
You live in vietnam?
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:23:09
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:11:41
You planning to sell 15k?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:36:09
Stfu newb
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:32:53
Uhhhh what drugs are you on?
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:10:07
Look at the patten of this years growth, at first its steady (prices hardly moves) then it starts going up fast testing all time highs. Then it gets to the point where the bot recognizes a good amt of profit. It dumps which causes around a 20% drop. Then it slowly goes up again and then stays steady for a couple days or a week. (Which is where we are now) so sometime tomorrow, few days or next week prices will be going up again and not looking back. Until it goes up too fast and it will drop back down again. 
Im 90% certain prices will go up very soon. All time highs.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:23:36
You in the wrong place for that question
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:28:41
Buy now, it will go up high soon
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:05:54
U sell now youll regret it later!
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:18:10
Yeah its the best time to buy
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:26:27
Around 13-15k in my opinion!
@_date: 2017-11-01 00:52:16
Only way is to buy in coinbase and transfer funds to gdax, then u can start trading for low fees at gdax
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:29:37
Thanks understand it now
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:16:46
What does leveraged 50x means?
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:07:24
BUY BUY BUY WE BOUNCING BACK BOYS!
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:49:10
That sucks...
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:51:34
It wont go down to 3-5k i think 5500-6000k max
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:10:01
HODL AND BUY MORE!!!
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:07:50
Bank to coinbase should be free, then transfer GDAX to buy or sell
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:44:46
If youre talking about a massive drop, it wont happen until a few days before the fork or after.. still got about 10 more days
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:12:43
You cant sell your b2x without moving it somewhere else. And if you do that (since theres no replay protection) the same transaction will be replayed on the btc chain.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:23:57
Sunday or Saturday will be over 8k, usually the time when people buy a lot of bitcoins to bet on NFL games
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:59:13
Dont ask for advice on here, nobody knows shit. Just do your own research
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:57:23
Ledger nano s, its on sale now 21% off
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:30:50
Okay gotcha. I didnt know you could get a loan. Sorry man.  I usually just use my own money to invest. Hope everything works out good for you later. Thanks for explaining it
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:11:51
I truly think bitcoin will survive. Bitcoin crash will have a few more pumps and it will die. I dont see bitcoin cash surviving long term. Im all for Bitcoin so i might sound a little bias.
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:16:47
Nobody here knows lol wtf.. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:58:37
I think so, but have no idea when...
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:27:39
Yeah that guy could probably sell me a christmas tree in February, very good speaker 
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:18:10
Just hold it until the fork and see what happens, you will get the same amt of bitcoins as u do b2x. So you could either sell b2x and buy more bitcoins or keep b2x depends on what will happen.
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:11:28
This sounds like a scam
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:16:12
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:09:43
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:56:59
Yes after fork
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:32:04
Nah u did well, it will go up
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:15:45
Yes and the answer is now before its too late
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:58:41
Lol ouch
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:15:05
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:39:16
Lmao itll go back up dont panic!
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:14:21
Depends what happens
@_date: 2017-11-04 04:26:41
If its that low just store it in coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:35:13
Paper wallet or hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:12:54
It wont go lower than 7,100 before it reaches 8k COME BACK HERE AND TELL ME ITS UNDER 7100
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:33:47
So youre not keeping it during fork to get b2x?
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:13:37
Do u have a link? Or some
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:58:13
Yeah just buy when it drops. Make sure you have back up money just incase it drops even more so you can buy more. To gain more when it rises again
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:38:15
What is ACH?
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:34:02
It only dropped like $200
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:08:03
Yes BUY TODAY AND HOLDDDD FOR A YEAR
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:23:42
U fked up when u bought BCH
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:32:49
Transfer from your bank to coinbase US dollar wallet, then go to GDAX.com create an account and transfer your money from coinbase over. Theres no fees if you do limit trades. 
GDAX is owned by coinbase so you dont have to worry about it being insecured 
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:35:32
It already dropped now its recovering
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:42:27
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:36:50
Lets get to 500,000 in 1 month!!!
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:11:25
Are u stupid? Get that shit post out if here
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:50:35
Itll go back up u should buy more at this price so youll earn more when it gets back to $7500
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:08:13
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:23:59
The simplest way for starters is at Coinbase.com, its pretty straight forward. Then i would recommend gdax.com to sell for cheaper fees. Watch some youtube tutorials on how to sell at gdax.com
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:46:56
Not if you use GDAX
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:02:24
Risk what? Like do not hodl or sell
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:27:10
As long as you know where your private key is, and dont let anyone else have it. Youre good
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:52:29
Nobody knows whats high and low..
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:28:02
GDAX no fees
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:11:30
If majority dump segwitx2 and bought more btc
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:46:55
Paper wallet
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:45:32
Sell half of your btc a little before fork, and then if it dips after fork then rebuy bitcoins and sell your b2x. (Thats if b2x dont succeed) if it does succeed then buy b2x after fork.
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:39:00
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:02:42
Fk no
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:20:43
There will be people who are with b2x, but these forks usually fail so usually people just sell
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:27:26
So u loaned it for high? And the exhange forced you to sell for low? Why didnt they just let you hold until it got higher
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:40:56
Yeah lets uncover that underwear
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:10:10
Wtf can you not look that up yourself? Lol
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:13:00
Hes a newb, bitcoin is always like this..
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:10:16
Yeah its cus theres a huge ass sell wall
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:52:24
Theres a check box that turns off the authorized login at the sign-in page
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:33:07
Lmao here we go boys im ready to buy more on this drop!!!
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:21:58
Sounds like a safe plan, since you bought it at a high price
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:09:27
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:15:53
Wheres your source
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:49:04
Yeah i wont miss out on the dip this time!
@_date: 2017-11-05 06:07:03
Yeah itll take a dip after the fork, so be careful..
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:01:45
They can still make money off fees
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:53:33
I think a lot of people waiting for a dio to buy more, so i would appreciate it if it does dip..
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:42:13
Yeah in your fking dreams
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:53:01
I dont get how you lost 3,1k can you explain more it more simply?? 
Just want to know so i can avoid losing money lol
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:14:57
LETS FKING GO TO THE MOON!!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:38:37
That amt is minuscule as fk, it wont do big harm against bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:39:29
Research first before you buy
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:10:40
Or let it dip so u could buy more..
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:43:01
Quit begging for money, go Earn ur bitcoins
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:54:45
Coinbase is better to start with, easy to use
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:32:12
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:35:08
Low 7k is the best time to buy, it will surpass 8k this weekend
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:33:48
Its owned by Coinbase, its an exhange company. If you do Limit orders theres no fees to buy or sell. I suggest looking it up on youtube "how to use gdax for no fees" something like that. Thats what i did and it was pretty easy to pick up. You can transfer your coins or US dollars from coinbase directly there for free. 
Do some research on GDAX on youtube. You'll figure it out.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:52:59
Yeah i really hope it drops that low again but to be safe ill probably buy around 6,000-6,500 and just buy more if it goes to 5500
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:22:26
So you got a loan? I dont understand lol only way i can think of how to lose money is if you sold lower than what you bought it for..
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:59:41
It will go past 7500, it looks like its repeating what it did last week..
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:36:24
Lets get to 500,000 in 1 month!
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:06:27
Lmao this dude is an idiot! Hahaha
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:10:03
On coinbase or gdax, theyll have the option for you to sell it after fork
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:00:37
Sell your b2x and then buy bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:11:29
Youre screwed breadwallet is trash
@_date: 2017-11-07 03:25:57
Theres always a chance u can lose bitcoins, just invest what u are comfortable losing
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:34:32
I love your enthusiasm!  
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:32:07
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:07:31
You could always buy more bitcoins
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:11:37
You dont short bitcoins
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:04:06
Whales dumping
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:40:17
Damn right! Its a attack alright!
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:59:30
Theres nothing wrong with GDAX
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:41:44
It depends if you believe In Bitcoin. Then u should just dump your b2x and buy more Bitcoins. Nobody knows what will happen or we'd all be rich...
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:12:32
Some will say itll dip, some will say it wont. I personally think it will eventually dip pass $7500 but i have no idea when
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:23:07
Yup i was waiting for it to go under $300 again and for LTC to go under $60 but it keeps going up...
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:05:39
HODL!!! I AINT SELLING EVEN IF IT HITS $0!
@_date: 2017-11-08 04:11:20
Coinbase with bank isnt instant but with debit it is but it only limits $1250 and 4% fee..
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:43:36
Move ur coins to GDAX, Coinbase owns that and its better for trading theres no fees if you use the market to sell and buy. Well buying its a very little fee compare to coinbase but selling is free
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:23:23
Youre good! Itll hit 8k
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:49:12
Are you selling it and then keep the fiat money in an exhange? Or buying another crypto?
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:20:05
U cant
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:23:18
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:20:38
I gotchu fam, ill come back to this reply and remind you
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:00:44
Nov 16
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:30:55
You buy half as much as u could afford to lose, and then if it dips couple hundred under the price you bought it then buy more.
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:53:46
Not in our life time
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:40:24
It will drop back 20-30% it has done this to many times in the past. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:46:57
Its all speculations, noone really knows how much itll drop. Personally i think it will drop back near 7k or even past it but idk when. But i could be wrong and it never passes 7.5k again...
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:14:59
Yeah i just have 1 btc, hoping it goes to the moon
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:33:05
Buy what u can afford to lose, dont check the price for 5 years and then thank me
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:18:15
Yes its safe
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:05:05
No the fk its not dead watch it bounce back to 10k
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:59:00
Big investors are setting their limits to buy low around 7k and buying all the cheap coins before they ignite it back up to sell those cheap coins
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:04:42
Let me grab my crystal ball out real quick
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:13:54
Transfer money to coinbase wallet, then transfer to GDAX to buy and sell for 0 fees. Buy bitcoin and hold. SEE U AT THE MOON
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:10:19
Dip or no dip, we all win. Just buy the dip!!
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:58:31
You should buy now, it wont be going down a lot and no matter how much it dips just hold! Youll regret it if you sell. TRUST THE PROCESS!
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:57:49
Research and find out if jaxx supports it, or just send jt to coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:58:14
Welcome, you are in the safe land. Buy and FOREVER HODL!!!
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:02:51
Invest after the fork, it will dip
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:33:16
So what do u want to know first? Wallet or fork
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:36:49
Just hold itll eventually go back up
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:28:51
Nobody knows
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:14:59
Yeah but id trust the official website more than amazon
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:23:37
Yeah it does that, best thing to do is deposit money from your bank to coinbase wallet. Then transfer over to GDAX to buy and sell. Don't buy at coinbase the fees are crazy high
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:32:59
Yeah i would either put it in a paper wallet, unless you're trading soon. 
The risk is that youre letting coinbase hold your money. If coinbase or you gets hacked. If you want to hokd then just put it in a paper wallet. 
Look up how to store your bitcoins to paper wallet on youtube. 
Remember to never share your private key or else whoever gets their hands on it can get your bitcoins and dont lose it or you cant have access to it
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:06:23
Its not that simple because theres no replay protection. People going to be losing money selling b2x. Its going to be a shitshow
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:14:20
Just hold it, itll hit 10k one day!!!
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:50:29
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:39:46
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:30:02
It will dip 3-4 more times
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:34:31
Yup you did the right choice, youll be happy in a couple months
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:05:44
You buy it and dont sell it
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:54:07
The more money you have the more youll make
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:35:21
Buy from coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:33:57
Yea theres no problem buying at coinbase and keeping it there for the fork
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:24:27
Yes unless the new coin takes over
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:01:10
BCH going nowhere
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:29:23
Higher limits with bank, debit card u can only buy $1250
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:50:17
Natashi on the yoshi?
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:43:31
Fork means a split, its like someone out there trying to come up with something better than Bitcoin to take over. So people usually people start selling because they're afraid the new coin will be the new bitcoin. Does that make sense? Im trying to explain it simple as possible lol
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:43:57
If youre holding a small amt its fine.. if youre holding big amount id recommend putting it in a cold storage unless youre day trading
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:44:45
Ive been waiting for ETH and LTC dip...
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:31:03
Same boat as u brother
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:18:16
Theres replay protection on coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:35:27
Just buy more everytime it goes down $600-$1000 range lol
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:59:39
$60 u should go casino and play blackjack
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:35:00
HOLD DONT SELL IF THERES A DIP. IT WILL GO BACK UP!!
@_date: 2017-11-04 03:17:11
Can someone summarize this video
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:35:57
Hold it, even when it dips. Itll go back up. Dont be scared!!!
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:23:02
Right now people are trying to raise the price up on bitcoin to get rich. Not as much people care about the transaction time and all that stuff thats suppose to make bitcoin better. Maybe later in the future. But of now its all about riding the spaceship to the moon.
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:05:05
Nothing is free, b2x has no replay protection
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:06:16
It wont go under 6.850k this week. Watch it hit 7600 again end if week
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:17:15
Youll have both coins after the fork, whether you decide to sell the new coin is up to you
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:35:29
Bc its better than having fiat in ur bank

If you store your bitcoin in coinbase, you will get a duplicated amt of b2x. So say you have 1 bitcoin you will then have 1 b2x. Its just a alt coin that is suppose to be the improved version of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:36:54
Yeah good luck with that, itll be a few days before fork and after fork to see the price fall down a lot

@_date: 2017-11-10 12:57:43
6.5k probably
@_date: 2017-11-05 02:33:35
On coinbase, you can lock in your price immediately and your bitcoins will come in around 7 business days. If you choose to deposit money in GDAX first then youll have to wait 4 days for you to lock in your price. Which waiting 4 days you could potentially lose out on a lot of money jf it goes up a lot.

Might be because a lot if people have money invested in bitcoin. Majority of people here just want to ride this train and get rich. Not as much care about the actual currency

@_date: 2017-11-09 05:59:32
Get ur LCD fixed
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:38:30
You should buy now!
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:41:45
Blockchain isnt as secure because you dont hold your private key, if you have a hardware or paper wallet you hold your own private key
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:27:01
Yes there is, sell it after the fork and buy more bitcoins at the dip
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:33:41
Way overpriced 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:34:43
Sign up at coinbase, buy what you can afford to lose and hold it
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:14:25
Yeah but you wont get the price u bought it out, itll come like 3-5 business days later
@_date: 2017-11-05 01:04:49
Yeah im on the same boat as you, i bought at $6300 and $6900. Was thinking about getting the b2x but theres no replay protection and dont know how to sell it without getting my btc's attacked. Looks like ill be selling it a couple days before fork also :p
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:49:54
Wait becauze its slowly dipping right now. Around $6500 is pretty safe
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:03:53
Buy now and sell before the fork, or buy after fork. Its most likely going to dip after the fork
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:06:54
No its not ending... bitcoin has a strong support. Itll bounce back. This is just caused by panic sellers that bought around $7500-$7800
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:29:57
NOT UNDER 7100 THO I GOT MY ORDERS BLOCKING IT!
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:11:14
Friday Saturday Sunday one of those days
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:30:56
If thats what u want, then go to an Alt coin. Get the fk off this train
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:57:03
You buy if you think it will go up a lot higher, if you dont think bitcoin will go up high then dont buy
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:23:36
can someone summarize this video, i dont have time to watch it all
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:09:05
Lmaaaoooo cracked up reading this
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:37:21
Throw away those bitcoin cash, get yourself some real bitcoins
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:55:42
Yep not buying in until under 3k
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:42:58
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:58:21
Just hodl it in your coinbase, and sell most of it when b2x comes out because its most likely be another dip
@_date: 2017-10-27 06:57:48
Go to sleep dude
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:58:34
No people selling hardfork coins and buying ALT coins, thats why all the ALT coins price increased a little
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:12:42
Bro are you asking how does a graph work?
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:19:00
U have 190 BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:43:29
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:37:39
If you not profiting over 5k i wouldnt even worry about it
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:25:26
Use coinbase
@_date: 2017-10-27 05:42:54
Itll go up atleast to $6500 tomorrow and saturday morning around 7k
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:47:46
If youre planning to invest then i would just wait until b2x comes out, because nobody really know what will happen. It could either take over BTC or just be another shitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:29:31
Because its the best
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:55:31
Itll most likely go up leading up to the fork, but after the fork hits bitcoin price will go down because people will start splitting off to the new coin. Then we would just have to wait to see if the new coin takes over or not to know whether to switch over to the new coin.
Good luck to you!
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:38:34
Just use coinbase
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:46:50
Did you sell it? Check to see if you have US dollars in your wallet
@_date: 2017-10-27 05:20:47
There will be a spike in 8 hours
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:28:30
Is the $395 store in coinbase?
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:28:04
Nobody knows forsure, just put in what you can afford to lose because a lot of shit can happen. Its 50/50
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:58:54
But i need my lambo right now!!!!
@_date: 2018-12-09 18:31:28
