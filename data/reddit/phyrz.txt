how is this different to coinjar swipe, which has been around for years?
I suppose having Visa onboard is a step forward..

You don't need to give them your private keys. Just a copy of the latest signed transaction that they can present if someone tries to defraud you.

Stop trying to understand cryptos as one thing. They are anything you can dream up and make work. They are software. They can be linked to an underlying economy (tether) or they can be stable (Dai).

I'm sure it's over at buttcoin right now.

Actually you said "most people" in your first post then changed it to "most Americans" in a follow up.

perhaps this could be solved with some sort of insurance company in the future?

Write some code to spin up a wallet on the command line using the seed then check the balance. Keep going until you get a hit.

You should add adafruit.com to your list.

That link reminds me of www and Tim berners Lee, and Linux and Linus. Thanks for posting.

we have to pay GST when buying bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-01-17 03:29:52
Well that's why you use a different address for each transaction, right?

In order to make it useful lots of people need to have it. That is what is happening now, making the price go up.
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:08:51
I'm with you. Looking forwards to a correction just to reassure me it's not a bubble. Strange world.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:04:15
I'd say there are plenty of hodlers waiting to accrue more if it sinks low enough. And low means different things to different people.

May give indication of the health of the tea leaf market?
Maybe thats where the money is running...  :P

I'm not sure WHY they would buy them all. Just saying they couldn't afford it because they would drive the price up. Like they would need to buy my one last for a trillion dollars right?
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:56:09
Yep you are dealing with a 6 yr old :P

So OP is still hodling to the very end, not jumping ship but remaining calm accepting their fate like a Gentlemen.
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:34:45
Not if your 2 crazy billionaires really really wanted it. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:12:12
No they couldn't because the price would rise  massively as they started buying.
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:01:11
I would. To support the project. Also I'd hold any coin until the price recovers. But mostly I'd just do it to keep Bitcoin alive.
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:57:54
Because they don't understand mining incentives ha
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:53:15
I agree with what you write. Trading curbs would stop a large single day drop ala Black Monday though right?
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:25:34
On the internet no one knows you are a dog.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:29:46
Yeah, but hopefully people have cooled off overnight? If its really going down hard it can't be stopped.
That said my point was that Black monday won't happen again due to regulations - it would have to be over a few days.
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:25:34
On the internet no one knows you are a dog.
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:03:38
Where to put token? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:38:37
Unlikely to happen again as they added circuit breakers after Black Monday.. they would just halt trading.

It's a joke meme. I'm here since 2012 I know the score
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:54:49
Yeah I get what you mean, but it conflicts with what you originally said - that the richest two people could buy all Bitcoins. If they tried to do that they would create extremely high demand regardless of the real world value of the Bitcoin.
Once they owned them all then the network would be worth nothing, unless they perhaps had a plan to redistribute them in some manner. Though it would be simpler and cheaper to just create an altcoin :-)

Look up fractional reserve multiplier effect. That's what people are talking about, using fractional reserve as a shorthand.

Hrm in that case so is the Australian dollar!

Actually they have pivoted into the remittance market as a result of the price drop.

That article is vague as all hell. I'm guessing he is a US citizen who was living in brissie?
@_date: 2015-10-05 11:16:09
Digital btc didn't close, but they did get out of the cryptsy deal. 
They are working on a remittance app now.
@_date: 2016-05-06 06:07:48
Ah yes. Excuse my poor comprehension. Also, what a dick.

Its not actaully a jpeg, its html. you can put any text in there, everything points to this one page.

I think they mean buying the house directly with Bitcoin.....
