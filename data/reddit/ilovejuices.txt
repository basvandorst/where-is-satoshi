How do you short a bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:43:18
Thank you good man

Bitcoin was $1,242 in 2013. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 21:50:13
Buy high. Sell never.
@_date: 2017-08-25 03:43:45
Because there's only ever going to be 20 million of them.
@_date: 2018-06-09 16:32:02
It's still the same value. That's like saying serial numbers on dollar bills make it not fungible. Each dollar is still worth the same is every other dollar. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 11:36:37
Someone get this man gold!
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:21:49
What's reversibility mean in the context of money? 
@_date: 2018-06-09 16:57:25
Yes that is a problem, but I don't see that being relevant to fungibility.
Fungible means the "individual units are interchangeable". Are you implying that for something to be fungible it has to be untraceable? 
@_date: 2018-06-09 14:58:26




All bitcoins are the same value to eachother. So shouldn't it be an A+? Shouldn't all 3 categories be A+ for fungibility?

More FUD the better IMO
@_date: 2019-06-05 03:18:39
Like I said... wake me up when it’s below 5k so I can buy more .
@_date: 2019-06-07 20:43:16
Of course they will ban it. But you underestimate the need for subversion. When Greece and Venezuela’s financial system fell apart the people turned to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:36:53
Who loses their minds that bitcoin uses computer power? What?
@_date: 2019-06-07 14:14:09
I believe in bitcoin precisely because governments want to disallow it.
@_date: 2019-06-07 14:13:38
They can try. But they won't succeed.
@_date: 2017-11-25 06:02:56
Which coins can you buy with fiat?
@_date: 2019-06-27 04:11:01
People seem to forget that 19k is the real baseline.
@_date: 2019-06-07 14:17:00
You can always turn cash into bitcoin. And there will always be a black market. Literally impossible to ban.

@_date: 2017-04-30 11:51:59
Bitcoin is more tightly regulated than any currency on the planet. In that it cannot be counterfeit, all transactions are public, and there will never be inflation. Those are literally the only regulations that matter. 
@_date: 2019-01-20 23:01:47
Also whats the 2019 low?
@_date: 2018-11-09 11:15:52
If you want fungible go monero, you will never have fungibility with a public blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 11:55:43


How is bitcoin different than this? Because of transaction fees? In that case the only fungible crypto is nano or iota.
@_date: 2018-07-30 14:45:34
Small macs?
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:14:22
Which one are you talking about? 
@_date: 2018-07-27 08:27:43
Bitcoin can be used to buy assets.

God I would love to see that. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 06:45:42
This explains the prolonged spike.
@_date: 2017-07-06 07:32:23
Can someone explain to me why bitcoin was only supposed to have ~~4 million~~ coins in total but there are over 16 million now?
edit: ok question answered
@_date: 2017-05-10 05:41:50
Nice one. Be sure again to buy when it hits 1800 and sell when it drops to 1000

What a great opportunity for you to explain to everyone.
@_date: 2019-05-14 07:39:29
5 minutes sounds about right for a $14k
@_date: 2019-05-20 06:14:57
SO any bank.
@_date: 2019-05-20 07:05:41
Banks in the USA are insured but only up to a certain amount. In 3rd world countries the banks just take your money when it runs out.
@_date: 2019-05-19 22:48:44
The real description should be:
"In a world where private central banks print fiat currency at whim, a new financial model is needed. Inflation slowly erodes our wealth. Gold, the hedge used against inflation since the dawn of civilization, is too cumbersome in today's fast-paced world. But what if there was such a thing as digital gold? Welcome to the new era of financial transactions. Welcome to Bitcoin."
@_date: 2019-05-20 03:42:56
You try and buy a cup of coffee with gold and tell me what happens.
Or order something on amazon with it.
