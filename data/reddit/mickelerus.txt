BTC is slowly going to zero
@_date: 2018-05-18 22:40:18
We need some bullballs now
@_date: 2018-05-05 09:04:25

@_date: 2018-05-29 14:08:30
don't buy....don't buy
@_date: 2018-05-30 16:08:48
of course, I keep laughing ... bought at 7500?
@_date: 2018-05-21 17:18:05
so, this was the bullshit pump and dump weekend
@_date: 2018-05-31 20:44:47
Whales ? you mean the trading platforms? 
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:10:16
F*** the whales
@_date: 2018-05-30 16:15:00
not at the first the best pump and all kids scream moon moon moon lambo lambo
@_date: 2018-05-31 17:12:58
Do not worry, they only want to hear positive sounds here. Before you know it, you are, according to others, on medication. Only they know it all.
When your moon is crying they will embrace you
@_date: 2018-05-30 20:45:08
Watch out with these predictors here, before you know it they think you are using medication
@_date: 2018-05-30 21:55:08
soms ben ik wel scherp ;)
@_date: 2018-05-30 21:35:01
and still not :)
@_date: 2018-05-29 21:16:25
Don't worry, the dump is on sunday ;)
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:57:26
1K bitcoins ..... I also understand that 1k in money is nothing. how many brains are there ,,,,
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:08:01
don't buy yet.....wait a while
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:07:10
people, do not believe in this pump. The whales will dump him again and suck your money. There is no investor who simply puts more than 1K bitcoin. end of the week or Sunday he will be dumped again.
Whales suck you empty ... do not you understand this yet?
@_date: 2018-05-24 10:58:16
BTC is bullshit , but still i can make money whit it 
@_date: 2018-05-31 21:11:50

@_date: 2018-05-11 21:24:30
fuck the mods
@_date: 2018-05-30 21:06:07
People wake up. The biggest manipulators are the bitcoin trading platforms. They make agreements for pump and dumps, don't you understand this?
Apart from the winnings when buying a coin, they also suck your money away. It is best not to trade but only to buy in the dip and hodl. They too are watching these kinds of forums for the sentiment among the people
@_date: 2018-05-18 14:05:59
When grow up.....when moon when moon
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:19:11
No, my friend, I am a holder.
Tonight another pump from Asia, to make it look real ... just pay attention
@_date: 2018-05-11 21:28:59
great a dip like this, buy buy and buy
@_date: 2018-05-30 15:18:31
And then they ask me if I'm on the medication after my argument from yesterday. After the first pump I said that asia would give a small pump to make it look real. after which it would collapse again. When I said that there would not be a madman to buy 1k bitcoins, but that that was a whale, I was declared insane. So my advice, do not buy anything for a while and let the whales ruin their own trade.

@_date: 2018-05-22 11:21:02
and kids are crying....when moon when moon when moon
@_date: 2018-05-30 16:07:13
Zei ik dat? lezen blijft lastig 
@_date: 2018-05-27 11:27:10
One should avoid forums like this, so that whales have no idea what is going on among the people
@_date: 2018-05-31 19:59:42
Yes and then? its a whale that will soon dumped again
@_date: 2018-06-03 21:51:22
let pump it up, asia
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:30:53
great thing, I left the right time, to get back in later.
No way hodlll, buy more in later
@_date: 2018-06-02 11:43:14
An hour later than normal a pump from Asia, then an hour later than usual a pump in Europe, I expect an hour later than usual a pump from USA. I think we are at 7800 within 10 hours. and then again the dump on Sunday
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:14:26
no, 5800 will be
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:43:54
right ;)
@_date: 2018-06-06 19:52:19
:) and everyone waiting for June 6 .... the big day
@_date: 2018-06-03 15:48:02
People understand it and do not believe this whale pumps anymore
@_date: 2018-06-08 10:37:50
Bulls do not have the strength.
It will not be anything anymore this year
@_date: 2018-06-10 08:30:05
if whales keep the price low, the little man gets in. That little man does not step in at 20k.
That way they shake everyone empty.
@_date: 2018-06-08 11:06:13
I am not surprised if the bulls and the bears are the same, the trading platforms!! they manipulate the price and wait for everyone to receive their holiday allowance and go in. Always around May / June and November an increase every year again. so the little man burned
@_date: 2018-06-01 15:37:48
I keep saying that the biggest manipulators are the trading platforms. They slowly empty people
@_date: 2018-06-10 08:57:17
:) you people? bought too high?
@_date: 2018-06-01 15:48:12
they are the bears and the bulls;) you think they can only live on the fees. they trade with each coin you parked in their wallet. Make agreements with each other when pumping and dumping
@_date: 2018-06-10 07:48:47
indeed, the whales (read bulls and bears) can only be killed by holding your bag for a few years, and not acting.
If you do not yet realize that the bears and bulls are the same (whales, trading platforms) then you do not understand and you better stop.
@_date: 2018-06-03 18:10:18
:) beter?
@_date: 2018-06-01 13:47:38
i hear that for months
@_date: 2018-06-04 10:58:52
down, it was to be expected again
@_date: 2018-06-04 20:51:00
manipulators (trading platforms such as gdax, litebit, kraken, bitstamp, etc.) keep the price low so that the small man can step in and be burned. thats the scam....
There will be no moon
@_date: 2018-06-04 21:24:05
the same with litebit....coincidence???
@_date: 2018-06-02 14:34:05
people who are hopeful are also often funnier than negative people
@_date: 2018-06-06 21:10:15
it was meant to be sarcastic..... that it has become nothing 
all those nonsense analyzes 
@_date: 2018-06-03 08:02:20
:) Whales try to pump but there is no movement
@_date: 2018-06-01 13:58:17
troll, your mother.
I just mean that I have to laugh because I can buy more because of a fall in prices
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:43:18
this is far from the dip .... sell and wait until $ 4000
@_date: 2018-06-10 10:36:11
great dip, i love it
@_date: 2018-06-12 20:11:14
get ready for the big dump.  $6000 is incoming
@_date: 2018-03-24 20:33:10
The wishes of losers or people who have burned themselves :)
@_date: 2018-03-11 11:08:51
btc has become a trade object .... forget the ath
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:27:58
propose to buy around 8200, then waiting for the 9000. Then set a stop-loss at 8600.
Lie back and wait for the fireworks.
If not, you are safe with the stop-loss and buy again around 6200-6500.
That will be my tactic :)
@_date: 2018-03-09 10:20:46
lol, it's the best coin to make money, dude
@_date: 2018-03-03 04:32:09
Clear .... the whole week slowly up so that everyone gets in again this weekend  ... pay attention at the end of the weekend
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:51:41
privacy my ass, there will soon be no privacy with btc or any crypto
@_date: 2018-02-26 21:57:19
let's hope that some Korean medals are exchanged for btc ;)
@_date: 2018-02-26 22:10:56
the aussies take their dollar cents
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:09:24
indeed, US dumps the price ..... lol
@_date: 2018-03-23 23:30:58
We go first to the 9800, when we break it we go to the 11800.
If not, we go back to 6300. When we reach 11800 we get a small correction and then towards ath
@_date: 2018-02-26 00:08:25
i will hold until 2140 :) 
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:49:48
do not ask stupid questions, hold your bitcoin to the end or find a job
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:32:06
come on people, hold your coins. i hate all that pussy's that go for a dollar profit
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:11:50
btc never goes to ath, it just became a commodity.
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:35:58
Then I will now quickly sell 
@_date: 2018-03-24 15:12:36
wannebies :))
do we know each other?
I give a hint, nothing more. Do what you want to be manneke
@_date: 2018-02-26 08:09:24
i'm waiting for a big run up
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:10:36
I do not agree ... as long as the price goes up and everyone wants to make $ 50 profit and sell, we will certainly not go up
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:13:49
there is a dip in the direction of 8000.
Then back towards the 9000.
When we can break through it, we will go uphill. If not, we will go to 6000.
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:11:37
it seems that the usa is taking the profit 
@_date: 2018-03-03 04:26:45
Right, .... and this time again just before the weekend so that everyone gets back into btc.... to dump it again at the end of weekend. The whales tactic always changed.
@_date: 2018-03-24 20:22:05
exactly, nothing Sunday sale, we go up.
Starts tomorrow or Monday ... to the crusial point of 10000
@_date: 2018-02-25 21:56:14
You mean....will done it well by the end of this week ?
@_date: 2018-02-25 23:55:57
Wow tough language, what a pleasure you have
@_date: 2018-03-24 14:56:45
on the way to 9800. crucial point. if we break that wall, we will go like a rocket in the coming weeks, with a small correction in the meantime. if we don't break through the 9800 then we fall back to 6300
Mark my words.

@_date: 2018-02-26 23:01:55

@_date: 2018-04-27 20:09:05

@_date: 2018-04-27 20:27:28

Dump time in the US
@_date: 2018-04-05 21:01:12

@_date: 2018-04-26 20:51:20
My girl friend asked me why I use green condoms last days
@_date: 2018-04-06 07:55:11
what could the price of bitcoin ever raise .... Nothing.
people do not trust it anymore. trading platforms suck everyone empty and have no interest in the price rising because they have to pay everyone when they dump.
Bitcoin dies a slow death at the end
@_date: 2018-04-25 10:40:39
good to go down, chance to come in again ..... discount
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:46:50
nothing bulls, this was a trap .... first back to the 5k.
Then to the moon
