Do they use cards from Wavecrest as well? 
@_date: 2016-04-11 08:01:43
We all should click on this ad to get them bancrupt soon
@_date: 2018-01-05 08:09:51
I hope this is not the beginning of the end of Bitcoin credit cards! Do you know any provider that doesn't rely on Wavecrest? 
@_date: 2018-01-05 06:23:41
For Bitwala cards as well... My card doesn't work anymore!
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:44:39
Thanks! Why no line charts? Would be easier to read IMO
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:45:41
Just don't sell
@_date: 2018-09-27 09:36:28
In Q5: How are the other 3 missing hashes received? How do we know which hashes are necessary, which are not? 
@_date: 2018-09-17 20:17:35
Computer was on, maybe the wallets open.
@_date: 2015-06-07 16:01:41
I'm safe if I persist the full wallet, no? 
@_date: 2018-05-24 18:16:44
Sorry, only Segwit addresses
@_date: 2018-05-17 10:26:15
Don't take it too seriously :) I'm having great fun!
@_date: 2018-05-16 06:32:18
I use their card since 3 months and it works perfectly with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-15 21:16:48
Monaco is not even out and you are blaming others for recommending working, actually existing alternatives? Lol
@_date: 2018-05-15 21:18:44
epayments works fine for me
@_date: 2016-01-20 18:07:07
check out the Bitcoin Ticker app
@_date: 2016-01-24 23:21:05
You can invest if you can afford loosing it. Big ups and downs are quite common by the way, check the chart.
@_date: 2017-08-14 08:52:01
Great vid
@_date: 2017-01-31 23:50:40
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:24:06
Maybe not currently. But there are other improvements on roadmap which lower tx fees AND keep it decentralized.
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:35:00
It has technical reasons why 1 MB. Some developers even would like to lower this limit. Read about it and you'll understand (if enough computer science background). 
That's by the way also root of this war -- different understandings/knowledge of how the system works. It's not that easy to grasp to be fair.  
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:04:55
You can do "child pays for parent" on wallets like Electrum. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 11:43:55
An E_mergency D_isaster A_voidance, which triggers every 48h. And this should be the new blockchain? LOL
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:41:51
@_date: 2017-01-31 12:22:25
Me too!
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:10:46
I like these

Bitcoin cash is not that decentralised as Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-11 13:01:39
Lambo time
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:09:39
Well over 90% have the intention to support Segwit2x. 
@_date: 2017-01-01 15:57:01
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:08:46
Big blocks reduce the amount of people/organisation in the world that can handle the network traffic. Not every country has good network infrastructure. 
Less people, more centralized. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:39:47
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:07:59
I'm not talking about the BCH chain. There will be a new chain if this Segwit2X fork happens.
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:23:19
That's it, that's all
@_date: 2016-11-17 06:51:58
Any idea where to get smartphones for BTC? Not in exchange for gift cards...
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:06:37
We also should report it (bottom of the page) to get it removed permanently.

You can import your seed generated by device A into device B 
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:36:27
Nice one!
@_date: 2017-04-13 04:43:14
Would they do it for real or is it just in theory?
@_date: 2017-04-26 13:11:18
Time to replace their app by another one...
@_date: 2017-04-06 17:10:07
What's the consequence of this? Will this mining hardware not work anymore if the "bug" is fixed?
@_date: 2017-04-13 01:46:01
@_date: 2017-04-26 00:26:12
Got this response regarding the current status and the possibility of trading tokens (march 2017)
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:16:58
Wouldn't you use &amp;&amp; instead of || here?
@_date: 2016-09-01 21:31:05
Yes, to read an article...
@_date: 2017-09-12 06:18:50
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:51:01
Sad. I also looked at its items almost every month. Wonder what's the actual reason for closing it. 
@_date: 2016-09-18 16:39:38
@_date: 2017-09-16 11:16:17
It's true. Hodlers are Bollywood fans. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 11:51:06
Is this bidirectional or is only the original chain affected?
@_date: 2017-09-27 12:06:42
So we could replay Segwit2X transactions on the original chain as well? 
@_date: 2016-09-04 07:40:03
@_date: 2017-10-06 06:34:58
Yes Bitfinex!!!
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:06:13
Is there a better resolution available?
@_date: 2017-09-26 20:36:37
True that
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:47:14
It's already dead
@_date: 2016-10-05 08:47:27
Bitcoins would arrive in less than a hour but maybe they have to follow some company processes/guidelines that slow down such a refund.
@_date: 2016-10-04 21:28:07
Would like to see this in shops accepting btc 
@_date: 2016-10-02 16:03:55
@_date: 2017-05-15 20:29:45
Yes I thought that as well
@_date: 2017-07-13 09:49:25
I guess because the software there is first that turns to 1th of August and activate these different things
@_date: 2016-05-05 21:54:25
to the moon
@_date: 2017-07-13 21:06:56
Then tell us why, thanks.
@_date: 2017-07-21 21:13:16
Lol :) nice
