I'm happy that you've enjoyed the ride, but everyone else should learn from you: with better habits you could have secured a retirement for you and your family.

Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge believer in crypto and it will eventually disrupt the current currency model, but bitcoin has never been a good currency. When fees were low, almost no one accepted it. Even now, you can't use it at 99% of places.

I used some, banked most. At the time (and now) it was not really a great currency.

It's really hard to analyze decisions of the past given what we know now. But I personally would have played it differently, and would have been in a better spot now because of it. (Source: I bought 1/60th what he did in 2012, and managed to bank far more than him by just being more conservative.)

Really good post OP. Most of us assume that BTC users are under 40 and tech savvy, this upturn and focus is rapidly changing that.

Isn't bitcoin also more likely to have tech surrounding it that can improve its functionality? I'm thinking like a btc collateralize loan that requires a wallet size of X or something.

To be clear, this is regulation for businesses that exchange bitcoins in NYC? Not for businesses that accept btc?

Absolutely the take-away from the video. We need to start 'marketing friendly' terms. Bitcoin is internet money with more features than most currencies. If regular currency is letters, btc is email.

My thoughts exactly. It's like when you hear the ultra rich complain about paying 'millions' in taxes. If you're earning 50x that, who gives a shit.

worrying about ATM fees when your money changes value in 40% swing increments lol
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:24:20
Yea let's hold these companies accountable, but by holding money in exchanges it is the equivalent of trusting a non-regulated entity with your money. Hopefully this isn't anything but it has happened before.

yea pure cancer, all the time

Yea I think the 'movement' needs to have more credibility. The meetup group in my city is full of artist types who are all selling some products like patches and actual coins, which is great. But there needs to be more traction with professionals, wall street types for it to really take off.

Thanks for aggressive reply. I have found that most vendors are on 'backorder' but you can still find things second hand. Not sure how the hashrate chart is relevant but I know about difficulty level etc. Happy to hear how it is.

Long story short: Hire a professional to do your taxes if you've made a few dollars in BTC. If you don't change to fiat you need not pay taxes - spending should be on the sales side anyway.
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:11:35
Is there a difference? Genuinely curious.
@_date: 2013-10-20 00:36:39
Makes sense - but if you had the opportunity for a $12,000 rig that will breakeven in 3 months and then start generating $140/day wouldn't you jump on it?
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:42:45
I see what you're saying. Taking over vs. it taking hold naturally.

I suggest paying the IRS under capital gains. Covers yourself, and may help in adoption.

Ditto for Philadelphia meetup. I'll commit $50 personally to start the pot 
@_date: 2013-10-20 01:31:52
Thank you for the information! I was using a different calculator that probably missed the mark with difficulty rate increasing quickly. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 19:04:07
Technically yes. I wouldn't get too concerned with it unless we're talking about $5,000 + the IRS won't pay attention to small gains. Not accounting advice or legal advice for the record!

If he bets I would definitely believe him, it would be a terrible thing to bet on unless you had insider knowledge. Otherwise he is lying, end of story.
