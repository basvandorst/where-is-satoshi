This is something I fear. The sheeps who still trust banks and government buying their cryptos instead of decentralized one.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:28:43
Finally! The dip I was waiting for!
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:23:47
Are you sure you have to withdraw? In Canada you are taxed only when you get out of the market, but I  thought the U.S. Taxed your gain at the end of the fiscal year, still in the market or not.

They will trick so much ignorant people with this...
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:51:52
Why not all three? A more diversified wallet is a lot less risky. Maybe put more money of the one you prefer(trust) and split what's left into the others.

Welcome to the world of gambling I guess? If you buy only because you like the technology and trust it, fine, but if you buy because you expect a big jump this week...
I'm waiting the end of this storm, I could lose some gain, but I know I will not lose on new position, what's happening this week is major, the long term trend is up and it will stay up until the next big news.

War on terror and banks when crypto will become widespread. Banks will put pressure on the US to outlaw it calling it: the main source of money for terrorist, if you use bitcoin, you are helping terrorists. 
It come from the deepest part of my ass, but man it wouldn't surprise me.

Like, every damn tech stock(I know btc is not a stock)? If I invest in a new technology, like I don't know, something that turn dog shit into meat and I think it's the future. I will buy stock from that company because I THINK it has value and that value will grow and make me a lot of money. Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right. It's the same thing with every tech stock.
This only show us 2 things
1) Financial journalist don't know shit in general
2) Financial journalist don't know shit about cryptos

You can't cash out like that, you need buyers. Everytime you are trying to sell a shitload of btc, like these guys have, the value drop. If they sell everything at the same time, they could even lose money at the end of the day, because of the panic it would create and everyone selling, pushing the price lower and lower.
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:16:38
Nope, not even 1% of the world are in the game. Lot of place to grow. Lot of new promising tech to come.
Dont focus only on BTC, look around, there is other good promising crypto too.

Pile a little bit of cash, so if somethings bad happen you do not become homeless.
Pay your bill.
Invest what you can. Depending on the interest rate of your debt, you will probably gain more money with the bitcoin grow rate than clearing your debt a little faster.

After some time bitcoin will mean milli bitcoin without bothering. Just like calories. Must people doesn't know that when they are talking about calories, it's Calories or kilocalories.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:03:57
It's Rorschach from Watchmen.

You should have an emergency cash, a planned retirement, than you should invest everything else.
Risky investment is not a retirement plan(it could, if you lower the risk to closer you are to retirement)... By the way, it will even improve your performance in investment, even if you have less cash in them.

I started to make my homework and gather information before diving in btc, it was around 700$. When I was comfortable enough to dive, it raised to around 3800$, I peed myself and ran away. Now I decided to look again when it raised to 10k, I opened an account yesterday and I'm waiting to be verified. Now it's fucking 16k... 
Short term BTC is definitively gambling... And I'm not sure if I should wait for a correction to catch the rebound or just jump in, absorb the possible crash and hold.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:58:00
So, having multiple jobs and body? If you are sick or lose your job, without an emergency cash in the US, you are mostly dead.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:54:42
I need that dip! 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:51:27
Don't short an uptrend... that's a high risk low reward strategy...
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:30:45
Should have put the word Shorters on the cavalry face, letting the gif play longer and put ''Buy Orders'' on the Scotish wooden spears :P.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:45:43
The two biggest market isn't even open... Wait for London at 3AM and NY at 8AM, if something happen, it's around that time...
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:28:15
They ''fake'' an open/close to create the chart.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:43:26
That's why I used a big C. When you are talking are you pronouncing the C louder to make everyone know you are talking about kilocalorie? No, because everyone mean kilocalories when they talk about Calories (with the exception of scientist I guess).
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:50:32
Honest question, is mining still a thing for nobody like us? I have a couple of computer and GPU laying around and I live somewhere where electricity doesn't cost a lot. Maybe not bitcoin, but litecoin or ether?
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:11:02
2020? Relax, 2017 is exceptional, this is not the norm... In 2040, crypto could be dominant, but not necessarily BTC.
I agree if BTC become widespread and use by "normies", everyone here holding a couple of thousands in BTC will be rich.
If not, we could lose everything in an heartbeat(the US making crypto illegal). 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:41:04
Shorting a long term uptrend is fucking stupid... Specially after the last days small dip...
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:42:32
I agree, most of the time, like 95%, but I'm sure there is some scientist out there using calorie.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:30:22
Who the fuck buy at a all time high?
Oh, you... Sorry.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:18:11
To be honest, the whole year was crazy, it doesn't surprise me to see so much people believing the grow will stay the same...
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:20:40
Keep that beer money for Cryptos. Talk about it to anyone interested in finance/politic and even conspiracies. This is something we neglect. The more people is using it, the more diluted and stable the "currency" become, higher are the chance for it to become something widespread. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:54:28
Probability. There is more chance to live until your ~75(depending on your location) than dying tomorrow. Sure, if you have terminal cancer or something like that, don't listen to me, but planing the futur is important to not end depending on the system, being a deadweight to society and living in poor conditions or becoming homeless at your retirement.
If you start soon, you don't need to put that much money per week.
3 months emergency cash is enough too.
