2% would be a lot. I guess it's also below 0.1%

Profitable for your friend or for the users? :-) I’m skeptical towards mining companies.. Why would they rent out their hardware for x-amount of money If they could use it for mining themselves.. users would only pay up 200 dollar if they could earn 300 for instance.. I know it’s fixed income for your friend and it will stay the same even If cryptos would crash.. but will you have users willing to buy into?!

I’m no expert but I think mining BTC is not profitable anymore for the novice miner.. Better to mine other PoW coins.. I think that there are cloud mining companies which can switch automatically to the most profitable coin.. Or this is a setting when joining a mining pool.. I would advise to buy 200 dollar worth of bitcoin every month instead of 200 dollar in mining.

Try using bitstamp. Friend of mine was validated in a week (a month ago). I have never withdrawn any money so can’t judge based on that. But depositing took 1-2 business days using SEPA. I will use it when I want to withdraw. Good luck with your friend!

I fully understand this and this way they have a fixed upfront income and are not dependant on the fluctuating price of BTC which is at an alltime high for the moment.. I'm just skeptical.. I was looking into this myself but have found some replies about not having the expected ROI (even negative)..

I also thought about it.. But why would they rent their servers out to make less cash than they would get by mining it themselves? And what If btc moves to pos? I'm skeptical to say the least..
