The positive news is the extension goes to after the Communist party conference so there's speculation that if China are looking to regulate, they'll allow those exchanges to continue under new regulations. Pure speculation though and the nature of the pump without sources to back it up makes it seem temporary to me. Bitcoin oversold + the extension + dead cat bounce + FOMO when it starts rising is definitely enough to propel it up. Remember that 3600 is the first real resistance it faced going up.

News about 2 exchanges having another month until they close I believe. You're most likely right though, it'll hit 4000 at the highest then come back down and probably hit fresh lows. Just seems like the dead cat bounce around 2850 people expected since that's it's strong support. Next stop weak support at 2400 or even strong support at 1850.
