As a newb, where do I go to see such information?
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:18:57
This guy bitcoins.

One drugs please!
@_date: 2019-12-15 19:47:41
lol uh wut

I’m not doubting your claim, but can you site where someone paid for a lambo in BTC only? (i.e. without converting it to fiat first)
Unless we stop converting it to paper money, it is not being used for it’s originally developed intention.
@_date: 2019-12-15 18:36:39
Right. But you’re not using it to buy the lambo. You are converting it to fiat, and then buying the lambo. Until you can buy the lambo with BTC, it is not being used as a currency.

Interesting, thanks for that! Assuming the article is factual, that is great to see. I hope we can get to a point where that is the primary use of BTC and not as a fiat financial investment tool.
@_date: 2019-12-15 19:31:48
Would it make me feel better? Haha! I don’t care what you do, just pointing out that Bitcoin has lost its way. Not too many people in this sub understand why it was developed. You enjoy how you leverage it, it is just not the way it was intended to be used.

Thanks for your insightful comment!
@_date: 2019-12-16 19:04:38
I think I’ve been corrected on that, which I’m glad to know. I was uninformed, but now I’m in the know!
@_date: 2019-12-15 18:42:33
That is an example of what BTC is supposed to be used for. Until people are not concerned with using it as an investment tool, and trading it back to fiat, then we will never be free from centralized banking.
@_date: 2019-12-15 18:35:17
That’s what I’m saying. That goes against what BTC was designed for. It was created as a means to combat centralized, government-controlled currency, not as an investment.
@_date: 2019-12-15 19:13:55


That’s exactly my point.


No, that is what the white paper says it is made for.
I’m just saying that it has lost its way, which is why I believe in the technology but do not believe it will ever be more than it is.
@_date: 2019-12-15 19:52:05
That is a good point. I’ll counter by asking how the USD gets its value, as it is not bound to anything? It gets its value by other countries’ faith in the US economy. Obviously, there are more factors that go into valuation, but the point is it is all a value based on something that is intangible. So, why not BTC? Why is it valued against another currency that it is meant to replace instead of being valued based on the faith of the technology?
@_date: 2019-12-15 19:32:22
This guy gets it!
@_date: 2019-12-15 18:54:00
No, I’m not. Here’s the white paper defining it, if you would care to read it.
@_date: 2019-12-15 18:51:05
Lol with the “get over it” comments. It’s tough to have an educated back-and-forth convo with people that use such phrasing, but I’ll try.
You see, BTC was not developed to be a commodity to trade for paper money. It’s sole purpose in the world was to create a new, government-proof way of commerce. Treating it as a collectible asset goes against the founding vision.
All I’m doing is pointing out the hypocrisy. I think it is a pipe dream to ever believe something will overtake the current way the fat cats manage their money. But it is certainly hypocritical to say you believe in a technology only to leverage said technology to make yourself more valuable in another system.
@_date: 2019-12-15 18:44:32
I appreciate that. To me, if we want to be free from a centralized banking platform, we have to stop converting back into it and focus on leveraging BTC as an actual currency. I don’t have the answer as to how, but it isn’t going to happen when all people care about is a cash grab.
@_date: 2019-12-15 18:38:22


I’m just saying it is hypocritical to convert it back to fiat and say that you support the technology at the same time. It’s not supposed to be an investment, it’s supposed to be a device to combat centralized banking.
@_date: 2019-12-16 19:03:31
This is true. I believe my sentiment was directed more toward bullet one. I should have acknowledged that a blanket statement is not accurate.
@_date: 2019-12-16 01:21:01
That’s fair. I suppose I just see way more posts about “mooning” and trying to make a quick fiat buck.
@_date: 2019-12-15 18:40:21
I just find it hypocritical. You do you, pal. But, you can’t say you believe in the nature of a technology that was built to defeat the centralization of government-controlled fiat currency and then just convert it back to that same paper money so you can buy cool stuff. Pointing out hypocrisy does not mean I’m bothered by your choices. Just want people to reflect on it.

What’s up with people putting the $ after the number lately? I’ve been seeing it a lot for some reason.
