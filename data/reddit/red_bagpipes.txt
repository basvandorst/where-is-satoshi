Ledger is great for secure storage, but it doesn't have lightning support yet. For the LN you need a second online wallet. Phones are OK for it since you only keep small amounts in it. 
The lightning wallet needs to open Bitcoin channels. If you want to have your own channels, eclair and Lightning Labs mobile wallet are good. 
If you dont mind a custodial wallet to start, Blue Wallet will let you borrow their channel right away so you can withdraw and use instantly.

As the bch stress test recently showed, nodes can't keep up with 4-8mb of transactions and blocks. And miners have delays in propagation. It's not about contention, it's about network failure, and the testnet that is bch showed us this failure first hand.
My personal belief is that a 7 minute block time and 2.5mb blocksize (or Segwit + 1.4mb) are the limits of 100% safety in 2019. I would support those changes.
@_date: 2019-07-25 01:41:56
You'll need a LN capable hot wallet. I use Lightning Labs' lightning Android wallet since it's noncustodial. Blue Wallet is easier and superior, but it's custodial.
Blue Wallet hooks you up to their own network so you can instantly withdraw/send. Lightning Labs you have your own wallet and need to set up your own channel. A bit more difficult, but you'll control it.
I'd recommend blue wallet to start.

There's a good chance you're reading the LN fees wrong. They natively use millisatoshis, and most fees are max 1 Satoshi per hop. So a transaction may be anywhere from 0.005 to 5 satoshis, compared to 100-500 satoshis on chain at 1 sat/byte.

My scenario would be dangerous to decentralized Bitcoin. But BSV only has one small cluster of nodes/miners running on Amazon web services. So they can mine 2gh transactions themselves without worry, because it's a completely centralized, closed loop.
@_date: 2019-07-09 06:49:21
It's already effectively 2mb thanks to Segwit.
Bch did a stress test in September, with the aim of 4-8mb average. Their nodes and wallets started dropping txs and lagging, and miners were having serious block propagation issues.  And their miners/nodes are much more centralized than Bitcoin, which should make it easier.
So I'm not convinced 4mb (2mb+Segwit) is 100% safe yet.

Blockchain.com and other tx explorers have one downside: they store your IP address, and the addresses you look at. So blockchain.com (and anyone who buys their info or hacks them) knows your coins are connected, and where they come/go.
Even if you use a VPN, they would still know your computer by the cookies, and connect your txs. So that only disguises your physical location.
@_date: 2019-07-22 15:19:56
With blocks this big, spam becomes a distant second threat to block propagation. If you send 100mb of transactions to your own miner and mine the block, the other miners will need to spend an hour downloading/verifying the block before they can start mining on top of it. By the time they do that, you've found another block! 
Rinse and repeat, one miner remains.

Coinjoins txs are easy to spot, even if you don't participate. You know there's 100 going in, and 100 shuffles going out. The point of the shuffle is to obfuscate who owns those outgoing 100.
Given the 100 are public and easy to spot, what's the advantage of participating?
I think the only way to game the system is if you control 99 of the 100. Then you can still track the  user, who believes you are 99 people.

There's lots of easy "wallets" that let you send Bitcoin wherever you want. For example, the Eclair mobile Bitcoin wallet.
But the holdup you're experiencing is the onboarding, where you need to trade fiat for Bitcoin at an exchange.
If you want a fast way to get Bitcoin into your own wallet, you could try a Bitcoin ATM. In exchange for the convenience of not waiting 12 days, they will charge you a premium price. If the premium isn't worth it, then you'll have to wait for the exchange.

Segwit wallets can send anywhere, no restrictions. Legacy wallets can receive anywhere, no restrictions. Not all legacy wallets can send to bech32, but that's mostly because of limitations the wallet puts on the address input field in anticipation of a shorter legacy addresses.
Any wallet has the potential to do bech32, they just need to make minor changes to the signing and address/qr input fields.
A wallet that doesn't allow transactions to bech32 is either hostile to users, or hasn't had an active dev in 2 years.

Easiest way to start is blue wallet, they let you share their own channels.
If you want to have your own channels, there are other mobile LN wallets where you keep on-chain Bitcoin and can send some into a LN channel. I currently use the Lightning Labs mobile wallet, which has a new autopilot feature to create channels for me.

It's some Bitcoin on the lightning network, a way to zap Bitcoin around fast and free.
The Blue Wallet app can get you started super fast. If you want to make your own network channels, there's tons of other great mobile wallets as well, like eclair and Lightning Labs wallets.
The lightning network (LN) is a scaling solution for Bitcoin. Good thing to read up on!

The low price is really a trick of high supply, not of a cheaper value.
For example, if there were 21 trillion Bitcoin instead of 21 million, the cost per coin would be 1 cent each, even though bitcoins network would be otherwise equal. $10 of Bitcoin would mean the same exact thing either way.
Also, 80% of xrp is owned by the company that created it. If the price rises, they will be the first to sell so they make themselves rich before you.

That's a tough question. There's a testnet Bitcoin already. And you could even fork your own Bitcoin Core node with a simple change like 2mb blocksize. But deploying a test on the scale of even tiny altcoins like Bch? I don't see anyone caring enough to try. Bch people had their livelihood riding on it, and they couldn't  even get a 32mb block out.

1/2- if you send to N1, indirectly, you're really sending to to N1's partner, then to N1, then to the next hop N1 is connected to. You're interacting with the channels, not so much the node. The node facilitates, but I don't think it can lie to it's partners about channel balance.
3- if I recall correctly, there is (or will be) a small channel amount beyond closing fee. So even after closing, you might get back 1000 satoshis or something. That's the minimum cheating punishment.

If you want to have your own channels, eclair and Lightning Labs mobile wallet are good. 
If you dont mind a custodial wallet to start, Blue Wallet will let you borrow their channel right away so you can withdraw and use instantly.

For LN to be noncustodial, your device holds the keys for on chian, and acts as a SPV node that updates whenever you open it to sync LN.
I use lightning labs wallet, works that way and has autopilot to make channels automatically.

Blue wallet is probably the easiest possible because it's custodial and let's you zap right into their own channels.
I haven't used Anton's Bitcoin lightning since the lightning labs wallet came out. IMO it's easier, although still a bit of a learning curve since you manage keys yourself.

1 - no, n1 can't advertise that. A's software finds it automatically and without any N permission
2 - again, no permission needed, and the in/out are done simultaneously.
3- I'm not sure if it's implemented yet, but there is a zero-state punishment solution. N1 still needs to keep a small amount of unspendable funds in his channel, at least enough for closing. If he cheats, he still loses those funds, even though he has no spendable funds.

They're getting to lows because the barrier to entry and the profit margin keeps going lower... So there's no room anymore for crazy profits.
Oregon, Cali, and Colorado have bales of weed they can't get rid of. It's common to see shops selling surplus for like $2-3/gram just to get rid of it.
Even with new states entering the market, the business model has been optimized over the past decade. It's a great business, don't get me wrong. But if you want to make money from it, I think you need to be more directly involved than stocks.

Blue Wallet's lightning channel is custodial - their keys, they let you borrow it and promise not to steal. But they give you instant access to the LN.
If you create your own wallet with a LN app like eclair, you need to get a channel with inbound capacity before you can withdraw the tip. You could do that yourself by sending btc on chain to the wallet, opening a channel, and freeing up inbound space by buying something. Or you could go to LNBig.com and request an inbound channel, and wait for them to give it to you.

Those pools are people with home antminer operations pointing their miner to it. They want to mine Bitcoin, and if they were forced to mine something else they'd switch.

I've heard Jihan and others are starting to argue fir POS. It's not as secure, but it would allow bitmain to maintain control in spite of their failed 7nm miners and dropping hashrate

Lightning channels are linked to your specific wallet.
If you restore your lightning wallet in another computer/phone, it'll look like the money is spent. It can't access the lightning channel since it's stored on the wallet itself.

It's an exchange, it'll be your exchange wallet. Most obvious solution  would be off chain transactions, just exchange user-to-user transfers.

Important clarification to OP, it's suboptimal.
Also very interesting to note that this has already been the case for a while. Bch mining tends to be 3-10% less profitable nowadays. Because profitable miners keep going to Bitcoin, and zealots who don't mind suboptimal go to bch

The transition happens when people (like me) and stores are willing to accept Bitcoin in lieu of cash, and hold the Bitcoin to be spent again later.

The problem is many merchants don't yet want to hodl Bitcoin. If they were to accept it, they want to cash out instantly. These apps ease the transition for them until they want to hodl or start using bitcoin directly to pay expenses.
@_date: 2018-08-05 04:06:09
I think other guy has a good point. Having a middleman as a payment processor is much different than depending on middlemen for the whole fiat process.
Bitcoin as the base currency layer is still secure, immutable, deflationary, etc. But in the short/medium term, you might need $200 in a mediated hot wallet for purchases.  It's not the end goal, but its still a huge step forward from fiat 
@_date: 2018-08-29 17:49:48
Also merchants currentky pay 2.7% for square credit cards, and square has to fork over like 2.5% of that to the processors/banks. If they offer crypto for 0.3%, it's win win for them.
That can help merchants onboard and gain awareness
@_date: 2019-07-24 22:17:55

It won't matter if a transaction costs a single satoshi
@_date: 2018-10-10 22:18:56
Schnorr signatures would make it easier for exchanges to reduce their footprint. But spam is intentional and malicious. Soammers can always keep sending legacy transactions. But their cost to do so goes up as our txs become more efficient and effectively cheaper.
@_date: 2018-10-29 11:22:16

@_date: 2019-08-23 15:47:03
Block size increases aren't limited to create a fee market, they're limited by safety and security.
Bch stress tests last year attempting 32mb blocks showed firsthand that nodes can't even keep up with 4mb blocks consistently. Given that Segwit pushed us to ~2mb, there's not a lot of room to go. That's why efficiency and development are so much more important than just changing a single variable and calling it a day.
@_date: 2019-08-20 19:58:38

Sounds like you don't know how transaction size works?
If there's a store where all items are $1, and a store where all items are $2, you can still go to the $1 store and pay $2/item. That doesn't mean the stores are the same price.

U/roasbeef thanks for all your awesome lightning work.
Couple questions about the wallet (based on issues with eclair) :
Is there channel recovery, and should I worry about losing channels from being offline or losing the app?
Is the wallet compatible with all segwit-enabled seeds?
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:43:40
By "our integration" does that mean linking your Coinbase account at bitrefill.com, like how purse.io and other sites currently do?
I guess my big question is, will all Coinbase users see this option directly on Coinbase?  That would be killer.
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:05:00

1&lt;2 bro
@_date: 2019-06-30 17:00:34
Maybe this will clear it up:
Miners don't chose transactions with the biggest fee. They choose transactions with the highest fee-to-byte ratio.
A Segwit transaction with it's 65% smaller size and 65% reduced fee, has the exact same appeal. Does that make sense?
@_date: 2019-06-17 02:41:31
Yes, but that trust works to the same extent of trusting miners and nodes run by other people. If there's 1000 watchtowers constantly checking every public node closure, even if one tower is dishonest, the other 999 will correct it.
Once watchtowers are out, the cost of running such a universal watchtower would be negligible. I foresee people running watchtowers for the same reasons they run nonmining nodes - to strengthen the network and enforce fairness.
@_date: 2019-06-30 05:00:55
I consolidated all my wallets into Segwits before the fee spiking happened. And jumped on the LN train on day 1. Hashtag reckless yo.

@_date: 2019-06-30 04:24:51
You've shifted the goalposts from "ln isn't out" to "merchants haven't decided to take it yet"...
@_date: 2019-06-17 19:50:17
Transaction fees will increase, but "transaction" will have a different impact.
First, when hardware tech is better, the blocksize can be increased. So there could be 10x or 100x as many transactions per block.
Second, lots of activity can be done with a single transaction. For example, lightning network or statechains can take a single transaction, and allow it to move around as much as you want, until you're ready to close the transaction.
Third, transactions on chain can constantly become more efficient. An exchange sending out money can combine transactions to save space and money. Upgrading to Segwit and other improvements save time and money.
So while the cost of storing a byte on the immortal Bitcoin ledger may increase, you really won't need many bytes for yourself.

@_date: 2019-06-28 22:06:58
This comment here folks. This is correct. Seen this same question all over the place this week lol
@_date: 2019-06-17 19:36:03
They dont use it because they don't pay the fees, so they don't care. They just stick it to you.
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:42:43
Am I too late to the party?
I used the new Lightning Wallets autopilot. I just sent some on chain btc, and it immediately converted it all to the LN! Then I spent a little to open some inbound capacity. Super stoked to upgrade from eclair.
For 8000 sats:
@_date: 2019-06-20 03:56:07
Yes, a special wallet where you send some Bitcoin from the main network to the lightning network, and from there you can zap it around the lightning network (LN).
@_date: 2019-06-14 13:46:56
Credit card fraud is rampant, but no one wants to talk about the huge cost of fixing the system. The CC company just bites the bullet and pays for fraud out of their own pocket. That's why fees are going up.
@_date: 2019-02-12 17:22:13
So ... Who should be paying the money to run the network? 
@_date: 2019-06-17 04:39:11
I mean .. you trust every Bitcoin miner to not unanimously conspire against you, right? 
That's not likely to happen, and if LN is sophisticated enough, watchtowers would be in the same boat
@_date: 2019-06-17 00:26:56
Why are watchtowers a deal breaker? They can be done automatically and trustlessly
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:37:45
Your wallet is compromised by someone who snooped your key. Bitpay sucks, but this isn't their fault.

Great point on centralization / validation, very important
@_date: 2019-06-19 23:32:35
The lightning network is a second layer Bitcoin upgrade, where you can send Bitcoin between lightning wallets instantly and for basically free. It's the solution for small and fast purchases that need to be quick and cheap.

@_date: 2019-06-14 14:52:05
The thesis of Bitcoin isn't to be cheaper than credit cards, but to be more secure, trusted, and without intermediaries and censorship. Being cheap is a nice secondary aim.
You can make Bitcoin cheaper with improvements. You can't make credit cards trustless.
@_date: 2019-06-19 21:06:48
I hadn't thought about that before. The libra is basically a ForEx ETF... Even if it doesn't fluctuate tons, it's still an investment against the dollar.  The IRS shouldn't turn a blind eye.
In practice though, I think Facebook lobbyists will overpower the govt and win out, at least in USA. The libra could be the first step towards corporations as governments, like in Dark Matters.
@_date: 2019-06-20 23:01:53
Just a guess, but maybe this is how transactions register when manually included by miners, but not publicly broadcast.
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:51:23


This is where the $275 went, is that in your wallet? My guess is it's a change address. When you spend money from an address, most wallets will spend ALL the money. The $25 goes to bitpay, and the $275 goes back to your wallet at the new address.
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:28:01
u/bitrefill this sounds awesome, but I'm a bit confused. Will Coinbase have this feature directly implemented in their website? Or does it just mean you can send from Coinbase to the Thor service?

@_date: 2019-06-24 09:37:22
Yes it is, it's just limited to satoshis by the current software for simplicity. That can be changed easily if needed, as Satoshi accounted for.
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:25:41
The high degree of trust is reduced almost completely by having multiple anonymous third parties working together to validate each statechain.
Also if conspiring happens, it can be overridden by the new owner broadcasting their statechains. Similar to LN watchtowers.

Luckily they can now accept lightning network, and never worry about that again
@_date: 2019-06-19 19:41:22
u/roasbeef thanks for all your great lightning work.
Is the wallet compatible with all lightning seeds? And are there channel recovery tools, or risks of losing channels from being offline or uninstalling the app?
Edit - I'm trying to load a 24 word seed from a previous lightning wallet and it's failing to authenticate. I'm too disorganized to remember if it's my eclair (3) or Anton's wallet (bc1) seed. But I get the impression only one format works?
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:04:53
Another perspective: you're not buying Bitcoin, you're selling dollars.
@_date: 2019-06-30 15:39:43
Yes you can. The user sets the fees in satoshis per byte. If you want/need to pay at 100 satoshis per byte, the cost of a Segwit tx is "cheaper" because it uses fewer bytes.

Bitcoin is transferred, trustlessly and irreversibly and permissionlessly. Just because it's not yet on the blockchain doesn't mean it's not transferred.

My last comment also answers this
@_date: 2018-07-25 17:51:33
I don't know what numbers you're looking at, but there's a million dollars of btc in the network right now... That's probably more than the entire history of all other altcoins' commercial activities combined.
@_date: 2018-07-29 00:31:18
Yeah he priced his channels outrageously and then declared LN a failure because no one wanted to overpay him for his node. Silly guy lol
@_date: 2018-07-26 01:05:41
Most merchants that accept Bitcoin immediately sell it for fiat. No holding but transaction volume. Good for ecosystem.
I think you hit your head when thinking if the definition of "holder" lol

@_date: 2018-07-25 22:40:39
"by definition, holders accept Bitcoin"
This is retarded. The problem is, merchants that don't accept Bitcoin aren't holders either. By getting them to accept and spend to them, you're creating more holders!

Their competitor Komodo does that. But from what I understand, they claim that approach requires centralization, whereas theirs is decentralized (but more expensive).
@_date: 2019-05-16 22:35:51
It's spam to bitcoin users, but not to Bitcoin per se. That's the benefit of a limited blockspace. If blocks were unlimited, spam could be unlimited too, to everyone's detriment.
@_date: 2019-05-17 01:22:35
Veriblock stated they don't do so because, despite fees being 100x lower, it's not secure and trustworthy. Only the real Bitcoin blockchain can be trusted.
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:16:06
We already know that current hardware can't propagate 4mb blocks without losing transactions, as seen in the bch stress tests. Bitcoin already offers 1.7mb blocks, there's not really a ton of room for immediate first layer blocksize increases.
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:18:12
Core doesn't control Bitcoin, anyone can implement a node software and mine any fork they want...
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:47:02
Yeah their claim is that Komodo's own chain was centralized, while theirs is decentralized.
@_date: 2019-05-31 03:54:22
First question - you don't need to have that money in the LN, but you need a channel that has that much 'emptiness' so it can fill up with that much. 
2- lots of exponential scaling solutions for LN are in the works, to open lots of channels efficiently at once (channel factories). And of course the linear block size increases in the future will help.
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:34:41
Crypto is decentralized, no ones in charge. You have to be the change you want to be. You could ask trezor to support LN, or even implement a solution yourself.
If you want something that is taken care of by a higher power, that's what dollars are for lol
@_date: 2019-05-17 01:19:59


Because the alternative is centralization, bugs, failures...
@_date: 2019-05-16 23:48:29
Totally accurate. Cheap storage on the world's most secure and distributed database will always have a use. 
The funny thing is, Veriblock itself says they don't use bcash because it's not secure. Even though the past 18 months, they could have saved hundreds of thousands on the cheaper fees. And then they'd still be running today.
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:15:55
Not affording a fee for a database isn't censorship
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:48:02
Veriblock said they don't consider bch because it's too easy to attack due to tiny hashrate
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:43:59
Huh? You can go anywhere. Bitcoin is democratic. If you can convince others to follow a 2mb fork, then Bitcoin will be 2mb.
Also blocksize is 1.7 right now, so 2 isn't a huge change...
@_date: 2019-05-29 18:40:59
Wow this is awesome. Cool stuff u/bitrefill
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:44:32
You know Core isn't the same as Bitcoin right?
@_date: 2019-05-17 01:48:09
For on chain transactions that have a permanent record anyone can see, yes.
If you're ok with a cheap, secure, immutable transaction that isn't published to the blockchain, the lightning network is a great option for that.
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:17:42
No one's stopping this from happening, and you don't need to wait for someone else to act for you. This is a decentralized currency, no one's in charge.
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:03:22
It's not worth attacking. Volume is so low that doublespending 2 bch would probably crash the market lol
@_date: 2019-05-17 01:15:18
It's not "good" but it's better than alternatives, such as a centralized, insecure, or attackable coin.
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:48:55
Who cares if a few transactions disappear into the ether, we made a 4mb block guyz!
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:42:06
Some big blocks got propagated, and that was impressive. But I watched it on r/btc live, and lots of users were reporting and confirming transactions disappearing into the ether.
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:57:02
There are exchanges that use LN, and services that offer free inbound channels. Alternatively, you could create a wallet and purchase an inbound prefunded channel through places like bitrefill, or in person from someone with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:45:09
I do control the private keys alone. No trust.

Bitcoin isn't a monolithic entity. That's the vision of the Democratic outcome of Bitcoin users.
@_date: 2019-05-16 19:17:23
Using space in an unchangeable, unhackable, eternal database is very valuable. Lots of people want to compete for that space this week due to bitcoins rising price, and that's the average fee they're willing to pay.
@_date: 2019-05-17 18:15:34
Bch doesn't function properly with 4mb blocks tho
@_date: 2019-05-17 18:31:59
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:41:18
Veriblock is an altcoin that secures itself (and offers to secure other altcoins) by posting some of its validation on Bitcoin as special transactions. Since Bitcoin is unhackable, more secure, etc.  
They were doing 75,000 transactions per day for the last 18 months, and lots of people complained about the spam. But now that fees rose, it came to a grinding halt. They can't afford to spam 75,000 transactions per day anymore.
If blocksize was bigger and Bitcoin was still as secure, the problem would still exist. Spam would fill up blocks as long as it's dirt cheap to do so.
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:24:14
They're only willing to pay very low fees though. This supports the idea that if Bitcoin were to increase blocksize, blocks would remain full so long as companies like Veriblock are willing to pay.
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:25:38
Vote with your wallet and move to an exchange that does use it? Or ask your current exchange for support?
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:14:20
Transactions are being delayed, not lost... Huge difference
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:46:27
You need to check every 2 weeks to keep the channel active for eclsir I think.
If you don't check it, the funds don't get stolen, they just get returned to you on chain.
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:58:09
I saw it happen live. Lots of regular bch users having their transactions show up on block explorers and then vanish.
Bch is such a small community - half of the 50kb-block transactions was just discovered to be one wallet spamming satoshis back and forth. No one outside of the bch community cared enough. Just like how the bug exploit that jammed the network for 2 hours yesterday has already been forgotten by the crypto community.
@_date: 2019-05-17 01:20:31
Have you tried the lightning network? It works great for microtransactions.
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:18:58

@_date: 2019-05-17 02:51:44
There's no static "custodian/Dev" of Bitcoin as there are with other coins. Anyone can hardfork Bitcoin or submit softwork improvements, which anyone can follow.
If you can't persuade people that 2mb is better, that's your own fault.
This is how things work when there's no one in charge.
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:17:16
Huh?? They don't have the private keys to your wallet, only to theirs. You have yours...
@_date: 2019-05-17 01:16:39
Did you miss the part where I mentioned getting it from a random person?
It's no more centralized than the method to buy any other crypto.
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:02:12
It's just a small centralized coin with a blip in it's long history of screwups. This isn't something that stops the presses lol
@_date: 2019-05-17 18:36:00
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:08:47
Bch did a stress test a few months ago, and nodes started dropping txs at 4mb blocks. So we know that limit exists.
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:23:56
Mempool default is like what, 500mb? And it can be increased manually, so many nodes will retain all transactions until the Mempool clears and it recirculates. Mempool at the worst was 300mb, so I don't think this has had the chance to happen, but it'd probably be safe to 2gb.
If someone spams the network with 3gb of 1sat/b transactions, then yes those deserve to get lost, that's a feature and not a bug.

If you need small and fast transactions with low fees, that's what the LN is great at. I use it every day, I pay subcent fees.
@_date: 2019-05-17 04:55:10
@_date: 2019-05-17 01:55:17
Exactly this happened when bch tried stress testing blocks above 4mb.
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:38:13
Totally agree, but that's why I'm so supportive of LN. For every one of us wanting to buy a cup of coffee, there's tons of businesses happy to pay 5 cents for an immutable, unhackable database entry. 
We know from bch stress tests that nodes start screwing up at 4mb (which is like 2.5mb+segwit), and we know from litecoin that 2.5 min blocktime risks orphaning a block about once a month. Exponential problems require exponential solutions.
@_date: 2019-05-17 22:02:26
The hashrate of however many people decide that core represents their vision of bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:25:49
Right, Veriblock uses Bitcoin as a second, more secure layer, as a backup for their weaker base layer.
@_date: 2019-05-20 21:05:36
How much overlap do you think there is between "people who watch 60 minutes" and Robin hood users...
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:12:52
The Core team doesn't control Bitcoin, they just control the repository of one node version. If everyone wanted to, they could fork to 2mb without them easily, by making a new client or by forking Core and making a new Core. You could do it yourself if you wanted to lead the charge.
In a vacuum, I might support a 2mb fork. But I believe it would set a precedent for continued increases instead of innovation. And another increase to 4mb means the death of Bitcoin. No coming back from that.
Also bch nodes started spinning at 4mb. 2mb Block + segwit is 3.4mb. I'm honestly not sure if that's safe.
