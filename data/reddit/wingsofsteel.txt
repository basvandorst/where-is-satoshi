The value of a bitcoin fluctuates too much. You decide to run a fractional reserve and the price goes up $100 in one day, you now have a significant risk factor.

I still own I should really start working on some community stuff!

I just sold on Localbitcoins. Don't forget that you're paying extra for the convenience, and try to go for cash! etransfers are sketchy. Meet me in a brightly lit timmies at two in the afternoon.

Mt gox has gotten the order to move the coins, but can't process them for some amount of time. When they move more funds out of cold storage the transfer goes through, so if it's still pending it could possibly get canceled.

As computers get faster, so will the attack. Plus, a smart attacker wouldn't waste his time on random addresses to begin with, I would do a dictionary attack with a 12 word seed, something akin to attempting to copy electrum's seed generator. These would incrementally speed up the attack.

Load them into your bitcoin client, and copy the adresses out of them. Pop them into the blockchain.info link above, and boom there's your balances. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:43:51
Absolutely. I'm looking at a future attack - what are the weaknesses that could be exploited to make the attack stronger?
I personally think that doing a dictionary attack against brainwallets would be the best way to start.

That's part of what I was doing when this transaction froze. As soon as this one clears, I'm going to move the rest off.
@_date: 2013-04-15 03:34:10
Lol, I hope not. Mind you, there is still another 75,000 blocks to load, sooo.
@_date: 2013-04-15 03:42:50
Yeah, reads out at 3.856 and 0.04 in a second wallet! Sweet!

You have to go in in person for them to even give you a response back. The manager has been saying she'll call me back for the last three days now, and each time I talk to loss prevention they say that there's been nothing done on the account, and I'll have to speak with the branch.

On top of that, they hold the bitcoin until november 1, 2014 regardless of the price.

Your domain is still parked as of 14/11/13 11 AM EST. Might want to get that fixed.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:58:32
Did you ever consider it might be someone you know? People do fucked up things like steal from family. : (

Also, they have to pay tax on each step of the purchase. It's not that simple to just get the title of the car. They could exchange in dollars and pay in gold.
@_date: 2013-04-15 02:03:04
I was like, oh yeah, I have 0.3 btc from an age ago! $20~! SWEET!
Cue me importing my wallet.dat file from my old hard drive...

You could always play D2JSP style ring games, with a few trusted community members being moderators.
You set a BTC = Chips ratio, such as 1 : 100 or 0.1 : 100, and play on a pokerstars private game. There's a full log of everything, and at the end of the game you exchange your remaining chips for BTC.
I just created for this very purpose!

Thanks, I hope this is the case. This is coins that I was converting to fiat for immediate use, so it sucks not having them immediately.
The whole point of bitcoin is to avoid crap like this, my fault for keeping them on an exchange.
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:44:11
Yup, this is along the lines of what I was thinking.
@_date: 2013-04-15 03:44:30
Thanks!
