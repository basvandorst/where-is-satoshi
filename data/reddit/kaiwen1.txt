Just tried it.  Here's the math:
P5000 transferred.
They gave me 0.270599 BTC.
Coinbase USD exchange rate $403.38.
USD to PHP on Google: P44.82 (And I *always* get better than this rate.)
0.270599 btc x 403.38 usd/btc x 44.82 php/usd = P4892.29 - P50 fee = P4842.29.
1 - 4842.29/5000 = 2.15%
Consider an additional 1% for getting into bitcoin in the first place, so 3.15% fee.
The max rebit.ph transfer is P50,000.  I usually wire transfer larger amounts, say $10,000.  I *always* get a better than Google, I'll go on the very low end here and say 44.92.  With my $40 wire fee, here's how it breaks down for me:
$40/$10,000 = 0.4% fee.
44.92-44.82 x (10000) = P1,000 additional pesos due to the better exchange rate.
For transfers of this size, a wire transfer is a much MUCH better deal than using rebit.ph.  And it takes all of about 5 minutes on the phone to complete using my bank.
For transfers of P50,000 and below (which is rebit's limit), their pricing and exchange rate might be competitive with other low-market services.  But for people sending more than tiny amounts of money to the Philippines, a traditional bank transfer offers a much MUCH better value.

Yep, this is a very, very bad deal.  To break even over one year, the difficulty would have to [increase by less than 10.6% per month](  But in the last month, it's gone up by 44%.  And in the last 12 months, it's gone up  almost 8000%.

Valid points. 
I transfer to a local dollar account and then use a local forex company, Optimum Traders. They have better rates than you see on Google.

How many bitcoins can one expect to make per month at this rate?  And how many 12 months from now given the current hash rate growth trajectory?

Guys, this is not rocket science.  Does bitcoin look like it's about to disappear?  No.  Major new services and investors are piling in everyday.  It's not going anywhere.  So there's lots of upside ahead.  Unless you're already at your limit for risk, a dip is a buying opportunity.  A bigger dip is a bigger buying opportunity.  And a huge fall is a huge buying opportunity.  Everyone of you guys who sell into these dips is making someone else – me for one – happy.  I'm buying at $500, buying more at $400, and if it goes to $100, far more yet.  If there was a reason you bought at $1000, then that reason is far more compelling at $500.  Remember the reason?  It's that bitcoin has a bright future.  Is that future as bright now as it was at $1000.  No.  It's even brighter!  So it's dead simple: if you're selling into these dips, you're being foolish.  If you're buying, you're being smart.

I think by "none at all" you mean "lose a lot".

If we're keeping the current symbol, can we all at least agree to have it stand up straight?

Reporting from the Philippines.  I just used this service to load credit on Globe.  It worked flawlessly.  I was seriously impressed.  I hit the submit button and five seconds later – I was counting – I received an SMS notification from Globe that the amount had been credited.  This is far easier than anything I've ever used for reloading on Globe.  I'm hooked.
EDIT: I also want to mention the exchange rate for this transaction was 0.5% above the current Bitstamp rate.

I wonder how many lives were saved by SR by making clean drugs available far away from dangerous dealers and gangs?

Comparing Ulbricht to Snowden is ludicrous. Ulbricht was in it for himself and put out hits on his own employee. Snowden has practically martyred himself for an entirely altruistic purpose.

When bitcoiners talk about inflation they're referring to monetary inflation, and we know exactly where that is going. You're referring to price inflation. It's a different thing.

They should have named it the "Winkledex".

Can't you recover from this using wallet tools?

It gives me great comfort to know that there will never be a United States of America vs. Bitcoin.

Thanks. That's exactly what I was looking for.  It says that a double-spend can be detected in "several seconds".  Do you know if anyone has measured this?  I think anything greater than five seconds would be unacceptable for typical POS applications.  I'd love to see a distribution graph for the detection lag.  What's the min, max, and average?  Also, how is the lag expected to grow as bitcoin becomes more popular?  Are there strategies or enhancements that can reduce it?

If bitcoin requires this kind of culture change to succeed, then it won't.

Is it any better than blockchain.info?

Here's a simple example: stop by corner store to get milk, pay with bitcoin at checkout, wait 14 minutes for the transaction to be verified, go home with your milk.
That is how the scenario would play out today.  Unless this changes such that transactions are verified near-instantaneously, bitcoin will not have mass appeal.

Alternatively, bitcoin could be worth .1 - .01x current price.

As it turns out, Chinese can actually learn to use Bitcoin in this other language called Chinese.

This thread would scare me off buying bitcoins if I were a noob. We really need a super-secure, super-easy way for people to store and access their wallet, and it needs to be online.  We can't expect granny and Joe Six-pack to print paper wallets and buy spare hardware for cold storage.

I've used CampBX for more than a year. Never had any issues.
