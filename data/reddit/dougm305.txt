Yes. Completely my fault there is no denying it.  Stupid mistake that I take full responsibility for it. Of course there is no such thing as business without profits. But the facts are they make money on all their transactions. So why take more of the customers who keep your business running. I think that is really bad business for them in the long run. This leaves good opportunities for the competition and innovators to the crypto space. I have nothing against Bitcoin or the Crypto space in fact my support for it has not changed. However Coinbase is definitely losing my business. 
As far as being my own bank I guess that is the price to pay and I will learn from this mistake. But I will always choose to be my own bank. Thats just me.
I wrote this to let other know especially new comers that do your homework before jumping in to Cryptos. Also maybe Coinbase can step up their game. Without customers they have no business therefore treat your customers right and innovate to avoid stupid issue like these which only lessens the confidence in the crypto space. Plus regardless of some sort of security measures to protect people and their money they do have the possibility to fix the issue even if they did charge a fee for it. That adds revenue to their business. The fact is they are saying its lost and they cant do anything about it when they have the public keys and can do the right thing. Again if 2 pennies made it through to my account there is no reason why the rest of the money couldn't, that is just shady business from this so called reputable business. 
Cryptos and Blockchain are the future for sure but hopefully we have better options and services other than Coinbase.
