That's true.  But there is also no such thing as a non-coercive government.
 
Government is by definition a group of people with power over others.  Coercion and violence are the only methods for acquiring power over others.
I recommend reading this FAQ.  Let me know if you have any questions.  ; )

The concept of majority rule does not apply to Bitcoin.  Anyone can voluntarily use Bitcoin in any way they see fit and with any rules they desire at any point in time.  Minorities are not subject to the whim of the majority, because *nobody* is ever *forced* to do anything or follow any rules.
You and your friends can fork and modify the Bitcoin code today for your own purposes there is nothing stopping you.
If you have any questions feel free to ask.  ; )

Voluntary taxation does not exist.
Tax: to require (someone) to pay a tax
The word you are looking for is probably trade.
Trade: the activity or process of buying, selling, or exchanging goods or services

Absolutely.  This is traditionally called a DRO.  The term government is misleading as it directly implies control and power (see merriam-webster).
No use in being misleading.  ; )
