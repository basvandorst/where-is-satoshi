Now that's one rolling joke I expect to stick around for a while.

This whole "fight the system by unsubscribing from a subreddit we don't agree with, and instead subscribe to a subreddit we own" thing is laughable at best. And really too bad that newcomers who want to know more about bitcoin have a pretty good chance to land on an opinionated, rogue site on first contact.

And that's the best way to have a genuine opinion, but it's not a great starter for a newcomer, who comes to figure out what this whole bitcoin thing is about, and sees a divided community in an ongoing beef over details they have no idea about.

It's pleasing to see that after the hard fork dust has settled, people on both sides of the argument start to notice, that in the end we all support the idea of blockchain, despite implementation differences. Thanks for bringing that up.

Not all exchanges allow you to deposit or exchange to fiat currencies.

Most bank loans are more of a scam than Bitcoin, considering interest rates. 
Bitcoin doesn't have a physical form, but that should not be an issue right now anymore (see mp3 for instance). 
Transaction fees might feel a bit high, but they're calculated based on Bitcoin's value. See other comments for more potential gotchas.
Bottom line, your friends calling it "probably a scam" are just not well informed.

Some visualisation of that "natural cycle" of yours:

It kind of reminds me of that viral "free hugs" pic from the internets. [This one.](

Maybe not entirely speculation, as the past data is based on archaeological and geological research, and these deserve at least some credit, despite not being 100% accurate for sure. Anyway, the solid black line is actually the most scary part of the whole graph.
