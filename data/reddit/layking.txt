I meant right now as opposed to waiting until its on a downward trajectory

You don't really know when the bottom is, but you can make an educated guess that the bottom isn't when its risen 12% in the past hour 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:41:35
You make a good point 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:23:20
Should we be buying right now?
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:21:39
Odds on this dipping?
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:42:03
This. So much this.

It would be great if you could donate to the Knockdown Youth Week, a voluntary organisation with 70 leaders who fundraise about 15,000 euro a year to run a summer camp in Ireland for kids, a lot of whom come from disadvantaged backgrounds. I know its not the typical type of charity that would get donated to, just thought it was worth a try as its a very worthwhile cause.

What would people say is a good price to buy at if it dips a little?
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:14:08
If i buy now am i just letting FOMO get to me or should i wait for the price to dip a little

I'm already in the bitcoin party and I'm hodling for dear life, when is the best time to buy back in do you think? at what price do you think is a fair value to go for?
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:18:26
Its looking like it is in the process of a small dip now, hard to tell if you'll get anything bigger before it rises again
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:33:33
Im asking myself the very same question
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:32:19
Been wondering this too
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:32:30
