Bitcoin Cash Halcyon. BCH.

Wasn't there some guy on here yesterday with a story like that?
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:50:15
That's physically impossible. I'm not going to crunch the numbers but for the last 3 days worth of BTC price climbing to outpace the earnings of your job with less than $500 invested you'd have to be earning far less than minimum wage.

5000 / 14226.63 = .3515BTC
.3515BTC x $17980 = $6319.16

You're trying to buy $1,000,000 of BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:32:46
Yes. Both will fuck you over, BofA will just fuck you harder.

1. Buy Bitcoin. 
2. Hold onto said Bitcoin.

Don't promote Roger.

Why would you assume that if someone says they have $500 of Bitcoin that they mean it was $500 when they bought it? No one measures it that way.

There's a reason that the absolute first rule of any investing is not to risk what you can't afford to lose.
@_date: 2018-05-05 20:21:48
Do you want increased adoption and valuation? Because media attention brings those.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:41:43
You were among the newbies once. The cycle marches ever onward.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:43:28
Welcome, friend. There's only one rule around these parts: HODL.

The only way an investment can grow to the point that you can't afford to lose it is if you're somehow changing your lifestyle to match your new "wealth" despite it not being liquid yet. If you act like the invested money is lost forever, you'll never encounter that issue.

I'm going to try my best not to be condescending, but this is a basic concept and I don't see what you're not understanding here. A Satoshi is 1/100,000,000 of a Bitcoin. That's 10^-8 . At current valuation, a US dollar is approx. 1/10,000 of a Bitcoin. That's 10^-4 . Since each value is 4 powers of 10 away from each other, the difference between them is a factor of 10,000. It has absolutely nothing to do at all with what currency you're measuring in. At one point, when the price of BTC was lower, 10,000 Satoshis was equal to 1 AUD. In the future, when the price of BTC is higher, 10,000 Satoshis will be equal to 1 GBP.

Do you have any credit history or other financial information that would be in public records?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:00:08
Yeah, they did. And this transaction paved the way for Bitcoin as a legitimate currency that can be exchanged for goods. If no one ever spent Bitcoin, it would have no value at all.

It blows your mind that 10^4 / 10^8 = 10^0 / 10^4 ?
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:38:46
A. Apple
B. Amazon
C. Bitcoin

Buy and hold. It's never too late.

1 mBTC = .001 BTC
1 bit = .000001 BTC
1 Satoshi = .00000001 BTC
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:03:39
Get ready.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:51:41
Not at all. With the current price of BTC at ~$10k, that makes 1 bit almost exactly equal to 1 cent. Cup of coffee? A couple hundred bits.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:50:59
Looks like that day is today.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:12:11
You don't understand. If one Bitcoin is worth 10,000 units of *any* currency, then a Satoshi will be 1/10,000 of a unit of that currency. It has nothing to do with USD. It's math.

Any single person who's in the crypto game at this point is an early adopter. Some are just earlier than others.

I think he means Osama. But I can't say for sure because this post reads like the work of a recent stroke victim.
