And dont forget those tax cuts came at a time when we could least afford being that we just came out of one of the greatest depresssions of all time and raised the public debt ceiling to historic proportions. We will not grow out of this and this is why BTC is thriving. Dont forget the financial crisis birthed BTC and crypto.

All this goes away if Trump isnt re-elected. We are in a boom time actually and this cooling off is needed to sustain the flow recession or depression are often caused by blackswan events and no one knows what they are when they will be hence the name. I think the better use case for bitcoins eventual rise is like that of emerging markets. Everyone loves them for there returns but dont trust them initially because of the risk but over time they too become part of the mainstream. Bitcoin will never replace fiat it will just be used to transact in. Now bitcoin or some other non government controlled digital asset could become the worlds reserve currency I believe thats possible. But for now I just watch the price action on the stock market vs btc and long as we gain more most days when its postive and lose less when its negative I know investors still love the coin.

And his tariffs and trade wars are whats going to cause a recession is what the OP is talking about. And to be fair all Trump did was cut taxes and signal to the rich they have a friend in the White House which released the animal spirits. It was all the quantitative easing of previous years that lit the fire, Trump tax cuts poured gasoline on them, and now the trade war is pouring water on it.

Never in the history of the world or economics has less trade equaled better economic prosperity. Look at the dates its not that far back geez. The stock market was on a tear because of all the stimulus from the previous administration and trump election signaled happy times for rich folks. And he confirmed with tax cuts. Then he got crazy and playing the short game with trade wars. Name me one economy that has blossed by adopting these tactics. Its stupid and it doesnt work. There are no globalists or none of that stupid shit its just People trying to get rich and stay that way like we all are.But Economic reason is always against isolationist policies. The fact that republicans planned a revolt against his plan for Mexico is evidence of this. Its cool to be tough but being smart is even better.

What does that have to do with trade? Youre the one keep meshing your issues together. You never ever stated how less trade is a good thing with examples. You just says its so lol. Thats unintelligent lol .

you make up the seed using a bip39 generator.  So I was doing this early in the am before I had my coffee and prolly copy and pasted the damn seed in the password box. If it was a password i just goofed on I should be able to crack it right? But if I made the seed the password Im sol? That what I'm saying I should have saved the seed but I didnt and what I thought was the password not the password and its not in memory what I was copying and pasting. I had to copy and paste it because I typed it twice. I wouldnt type a 15 word passphrase out as a password. See what I'm saying I think I used the darn wallet seed as my password smh. What about the password do you know any tools that support electrum segwit wallets?

Free trade is what made the modern world what the hell are u talking about. There is a reason there is a McDonald’s in every country right along wit Starbucks. All the computers run windows and phones have android and apple on them. What you’re suggesting is every country build their own stuff even if it’s not inclined to do so? This free trade beast everyone hates is also responsible for the wealth that has been accumulated that all the people enjoy thru higher stock prices and consumption which leads to higher tax collection which governments use to borrow money and improve their citizens lives. Reddit is a product of globalization. If the internet wasn’t global no reddit. Then we wouldn’t be in here arguing about how globalization is bad ������. Y’all crazy so if you had a billion dollars you wouldn’t put it work around the world for your own self interests. That would make you a evil globalist as you call it. Y’all gotta stop watching the news and actually read. Capitalism yes cracks a couple eggs along the way but the omelette a are damn tasty

if its actually a mistyped password I cant bruteforce that because I know what it should be. But if I copy and pasted my seed I dont know what to do.

you dont have to use centralized services. You can use the decentralized software. But if you want to exchange to fiat and vice-versa you gonna have to deal with the government.

Oh I agree Im just saying you should know what youre doing is all. Chances of him getting into trouble slim to none but still just know all im saying. I agree tho too petty for anyone caring but it does happen or else it would be a big company doing it. Who wouldnt want to make 6 to 10 percent for converting crypto to fiat and vice versa. 
@_date: 2018-11-10 00:45:26
Not trying to rain on your parade but if you look up your local state laws it says this exact same thing. Theres plenty of people arrested for money laudering selling bitcoins on sites like that doing exactly what your doing especially if your not following any kyc/aml procedures. Probably wont matter but just know it can happen. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 17:01:12
Trust-less systems &gt; are better than trust-based ones because of the latter trust problem. Banks by design would be better if greedy humans didn't run them. With crypto and trust-less systems you program the rules in the system and the system always does what it supposed to do. I mean thats whats called a paradigm shift right there. Crypto is akin to the industrial revolution watch.

to cash out into fiat. What most people dont realize is bitcoin is more about software than currency. Bitcoin in its current form is just open-sourc paypal in a simple since. This kind of adoption makes Bitcoin way more valuable and lead to more adoption which will rival other money supplies and might surpass M1 stores. But the need to get into and out of fiat easy is needed now. And so what they can trace stuff now. This is software it will change like everything else it will be cat and mouse but this is a win for bitcoin loss to privacy I agree but still a win for bitcoin. I dont think at this point bitcoin should be even be considered for privacy anymore its misleading honestly aint shit private about it lol.

@_date: 2018-12-06 02:40:41
Thats because bitcoin is harder to convert into fiat unlinke other currencies. I buy stuff from china all the time and paypal converts it into rmb for me and just charges the fee. With crypto all these hoops exist which makes it inferior. But still try sending money overseas crypto still better albeit if the other person can make the exchange into fiat. The point when crypto becomes "people stuff" is when the exchange of crypto into fiat and vice versa is friction-less as it should be. Then crypto makes things like debit cards, gift cards, checks obsolete. How much do banks lose in chargebacks a year from fraud. This would go way down if crypto was the main currency of  choice online. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 21:41:05
The video is explaining to you market manipulation. All markets are manipulated thats how the game works. Its called group think in behavioral economics. People tend to think with the herd instead of doing whats logical for them. So market manipulation is a moot point. What I'm saying is Bitcoin is practice. Central bank digital is game time watch. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 15:26:38
yall slow they dont want little people to win. Decentrailiation is competition and competition is a profit destroyer. So they will fleece the shit out of everyone and come up with a centralized coin and control that. But I think it wont work and you will have two competing worlds online from now on. The decentralized and the centralized till somebody figure out the balance. Same shit happened with music streaming watch.

Right now that’s true will it be in five years is the question hell your debit card probably will be “smart” in five years. I just think Crypto is a perfect replacement for anything financial on the internet. For me I think it’s actually more trustworthy than fiat but that’s another argument.
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:48:28
You sir are right. I would def pick the S&amp;P 500 for the next 50-100 years but I think Warren and like alot of other people of his ilk doesnt fully grasp the technology. There's a huge gap between finance people and tech people I guess its not alot of similiarity in the educations idk. But I think thats the reason why the divide. Tech people cant see why u would have a world without bitcoin. And Finance people see the predictable tangible world they live in now. Still doesnt matter however because the value of the digital is here to stay and the blockchain in the confirmation of such. I think Warren will be right and crypto will be right. I dont think Bitcoin in its current form will last but crypto currencies are here to stay.

One second I think we generalizing too much. 
Centralization means there is someone or something that has control over it. Google and most software today is centralized. There is someone in charge. There is somebody responsible. 
Decentralization means there are many people responsible so there is no one person over it. This is akin to open-source software where the code is free to use as you see fit. You cant take everyone down. You cant ban everyone. The benefit of decentralized is its ablitity to become ubiquitous which is its greatest strength.  If you blowup Google hq there is no more google. Where is Bitcoin HQ? Wherever there is a full node and a miner is HQ. So anybody can be HQ. Those casa nodes everyone sells is a evolution of that idea. Keeping your private keys to your wallet is like that. Thats what I mean by decentralization. Internet Money (online monetary transfer systems)  is not a new idea. The creation of open-source software (blockchain) and their corresponding tokens (crytptos) are. 
I mean the argument which is better traditional banking vs dencetralized banking isnt fair because its so new. But give it time.
Compare crypto to early days of online shopping. Scary as hell but over time it will take over the traditonal process. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 16:36:35
I can see your point "governance-wise" it would be pretty hard to run (right now) without some form of leadership. I predict with advancements in A.I. you could have systems that run without human intervention where the rules would be coded in the software and etc. But that still would need some form of democracy to vote the rules so I can def see you point there. 
What I mean by decentralized vs centralized: 
Google is a propietary company that is very big but I would not say ubiquitous. I can live my life without google. Would be hard lol but I can do it. Its software is not free and widely used by everyone for free without too much restriction. I cannot run google's algorhthm on my own server. If the governments around the world wanted to get rid of google you just blow up all those offices they have and boom no more network. The internet and life would go on just not without google. 
TCP/IP on the other hand is software that is decentralized and everyone uses it for free pretty much. How can you blow up the internet? You cant. I mean if you really tried you could but you get my point. 
Blockchain seeks to be TCP/IP for its tokens. Bitcoin is the first product of this concept with miners, developers, and users forming the networks. What makes this unique is that its possible to do something so great and big for as cheap or free as possible is truly earth changing. The financial internet or blockchain is the real star here. 
Too big to fail is not real these companies are huge dont get me wrong. But they're not gods. Alot of our great tech companies are just successful because of first-mover advantage. I think in the future we will have decentralized open source autonomous systems powered by A.I that will kick the shit out of the FANG stocks and bring in a new era or prosperity. Of course this will lead to Big Brother but thats another argument lol. 
Shit were arguing about it now lol. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 21:46:29
They're losing the war is exactly while they adapt. Dont forget wars were fought over what fiat to use and central banks. If you think those same people gone let Satoshi fuck up their good thing yall crazy. You wouldn't even need wall st if you decentralization became a thing. Software as a service and the cloud along with A.I. are paradigm shifting technologies all im saying. Bitcoin was never the point of crypto decentralization was. Bitcoin was just the first great app of this concept.

bitcoin isnt centralized at least not in theory maybe in practice because of current technologies but in theory its not centralized. Its network can be spread without intervention from anyone but the users of the network. Plus bitcoin is a tokenization of the blockchain for use as a monetary transfer system. Decentralized banking if you will software based. Its not money. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:28:05
All of the problems with bitcoin aren't core problems with bitcoin. Its government acceptance of bitcoin. If I can play roulette with most of the spaces black and I choose black then yeah I will play roulette then. Government will give in price go upwards in a hurry.

The media is ran by rich people who have a vested interest (obviously they have alot of fiat) in making sure some software doesn't ruin their investments. Its our job not to be stupid not their job to not take advantage of us because we are. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 14:03:47
it could be done on an etherum platform with conversion capabilities and make it open source software or like some mining software have the fees built into the code. Problem is how you get paid. Crypto to fiat is where they get you. Your basically treated as a money launderer at that point. Now when these companies that provide goods and services start accepting coin or some company figures out a purchasing service/debit card for crypto I think these platforms will def switch. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 05:12:45
Simple. 
Step 1: Create your own digital currency (us digital)
Step 2: Make it illegal to convert from crypto to paper fiat.
Step 3: Make it legal and very easy to convert from crypto to digital fiat.
Step 4: Make digital fiat KYC based.
And boom there you go. Same functionality but greater monitoring capabilities plus they keep their central bank in the game. 
Only way Crypto gets accepted as money is if we want to start a war bout it other than that forget about. Now using it as Paypal on steroids totally possible, most likely probable and best use case imo.

The fact we dont know if satoshi is dead or alive is scary. I mean this guy is probably a bilionaire right now. What if he pops up one day when bitcoin is on its third moon ride and says hey world Im a trillionaire whats good. Lol I hate to say it but I hope the CIA already nutralized him because if not man oh man.

I agree maybe for previous generations. But take my daughter for instance or my little niece or any other young person in this day and age their phones are attached to them. I think banks will be around just their functions will be a lot different becasue of this technology. I think crypto democratizes the banking sector honestly.
