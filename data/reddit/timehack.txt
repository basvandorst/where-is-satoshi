"Unlike some of those other "currencies" out there, we are backed up by and have access to the customer trust and fortitude of the world's largest online retailer"
Smart move by Amazon. IMO they could really bring crypto currencies into the main stream by solving some of the huge problems that bitcoin faces. They have the infrastructure and resources to make it easy to obtain (buy with credit card easy), easy to use, and the amazon branding will make it legitimate (vs the perception of "anonymous hitmen internet drug dealer money")

Its expensive because its a four letter domain name (not because of anything relating to bitcoin). In fact, last I heard there are no four letter .com TLDs left that you can just register.

Devils advocate: As a customer I want the ability to chargeback. What if the seller never ships my stuff? If I pay with PayPal I'm protected.

Thanks, and nice site btw

Up to 50%...

Thanks. Also there's no way to spend a small amount from the paper wallet (to verify it "works") without compromising the private key, right?

Out of curiosity - what did you mean by "assuming you don't live in Florida"?

What makes you think the banks will not classify your transactions as cash advances? Is that part of your agreement with them?
Edit: and if so, that's a good feature. You must get want to play it up

Thanks, sorry I didn't mention I did use bitcoinpaperwallet.com offline as well (booted from live CD). 
Related, how would you compare generating with a linux live cd vs a brand new computer?
@_date: 2014-10-02 02:30:56
Take advantage while you can... don't expect it to last long. As soon as the banks catch on expect all transactions to be classified as cash advances (that's what they are). 
It would be way too easy to abuse for credit card rewards otherwise. Reminds me of back when the mint allowed you to purchase dollar coins with credit. People bought in massive quantities, deposited into a bank, pay the bill, repeat. Free credit card rewards.

Have you contacted support?

The problem with this argument is that if a person intends defraud you using a chargeback the bitcoin part is irrelevant. They will just pay with a card. You're basically just giving a discount to the people who weren't going to charge back anyway.

You have 50% of your retirement invested in bitcoin?

If you used the coins that you bought back after you paid your bill last month at this time (assuming $470/btc) you paid $197 for your service. 
Plus you paid to convert fiat to Bitcoin in the first place. Not sure how much you really "saved" overall.

I'm confused what you mean by this. The bank would see this transaction as a cash advance. First a separate cash advance fee will probably be charged (depending on the terms of your credit card account). In my experience the fee ranges from $5-$15. Most are $10.  Also, cash advances usually begin accruing interest on day one, and usually at a much higher rate than purchases - some up to 29.9% APR. So if you don't pay your credit card bill for a month (or even worse if you carry a balance month to month) expect another hefty sum going to the bank. (Note I can only speak from my experience in the US)

Genuinely curious, what would be his incentive
to do this vs only accepting a check? 
It seems like everybody is just paying fees to convert fiat to bitcoin and back for no good reason. Is there a benefit I'm missing?

If Bitcoin increased substantially in price, how do you plan to do your taxes?
@_date: 2015-01-31 22:18:53
This is likely against the TOS of many ISPs. 
More practically, good luck explaining to the FBI "it wasn't me" when they ask about all the child porn downloaded over your connection.

I don't think they would make enough profit because many people just use them for cold storage anyway. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 23:13:44
This is why people don't take Bitcoin seriously.

And if you leave your wifi open you are still responsible for what happens on your connection.

This defeats the entire point of a 401k (employer matching and tax benefits)
@_date: 2015-02-01 03:03:26
Got it. I'm just saying virtually no (US at least) ISP will be on board with this.
