Then tell them that, that you can carry these days a fortune on a piece of paper or USB. 
Makes you more believable and they would look it up themselves, what are the chances the will now? If you told me about btc with such story I would never done anything with it.

Because you look like one of those loonies that escaped. Why don't give him a normal story?

So what happens with the bitcoin you own before the changes? I get equal amount on both new forks? Now stores will support either or both types of coin? 
Still seems incredibly silly to divide the bitcoin while it seems to finally get adapted world wide.

Don't you mean that just the Miners stand united and the rest of the users are standing there with their dick in their hands?

Secretly everyone has the same end goal: get fucking rich from the gains. Everything else is optional.

Seems odd to not upgrade the block size. In essence it seems to cost nothing while you pay less per transaction  
And Miners determine the majority not the users

I don't know enough of either to make a serious comment.. But I rather want to see that we stick with one. Preferably the choice that makes me perform cheap transactions.
