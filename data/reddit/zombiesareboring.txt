Do these 'hackers' have machines which brute force the private key or something?
@_date: 2015-01-22 04:37:00
Damn, they made it easier for those with bank ASICs
@_date: 2015-01-29 05:27:39

The first addresses used by Satoshi, the creator/s of bitcoin. You can find then by looking where the first blocks sent their bitcoins to

A node is a computer that helps bitcoin peers by sending new blocks and transactions that they make themselves or get from other nodes.  It's like how torrents work.  Once you download the file, you help others by sending the download to them

My testnet bitcoin node has served 1 gigabyte with 46 connections :)
@_date: 2015-03-01 01:19:50
Lets add base32 and base64 on there too
@_date: 2015-03-14 00:34:49
People mine the testnet coins just so they can support devs using it, they need the coins for deveploing purposes themselves, or just testing out thier miner

After chasing down the stolen bitcoin trail, the "payout" seems to be here
