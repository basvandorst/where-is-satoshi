I forgot that you actually can choose your transaction fee to get it done faster/slower, so thats what left me confused.

But why?

Oh yeah?
I think Elena(21) just 6km from me is waiting for me...
So I'll go for that one

Sorry, I don't get it.. 
So with open and close you mean the lightning network?
And if that's the case what's the advantage then? Because I've heard that it's good for small transactions between some store and the customer, to literally get zero transaction fees.
And if the channel has to stay opened they can't access the coins, right?

piss and poop samples are the problem, and I don't get why people care... nobody gives a fck about my identity when I buy something "real" on the internet.

Mabey there should be a decentralized antiterror section in the bitcoin blockchain... so just people with transactions larger than 1Mio or a lot of transactions in a short period of time made with one adress are spyed on.

Nice. Don't get why all of these exchanges have such a non-intuitive interface...
I think thats a big reason why the "little" peolpe don't get into crypto

You spend it when it has enough value for you. But for most people its the same with fiat, they hodl it until they think the money is worth for what they buy.
But with crypto most people "see" the value and the price they got it for, and believe in the growth in price. You could also invest in other fiat with lower inflation rates to minimize the loss in some specific time, and hodl there. But its all negative, so why not buy BTC?
Because its speculative... no one knows where the technologie is going. So a lot of people (sellers and entrepreneurs) just don't want to have a currency that may drop 10% a day just to have a possibility for a 10000% growth in the next years... they rather have a guaranteed 2-3% loss every year, because they are getting enough money for this way.
And thats the problem with the adoption of Bitcoin.
