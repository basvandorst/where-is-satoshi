The price peaked around 19.7k, dipped to 15.3k and now is frozen around 16.3k.
Gemini looks to have stabilized at 15.3k.

What about just the vast amounts of new people buying small amounts on coinbase, will the ask price increase with each $10 transaction?

Sorry, I'm not familiar with GDAX but with a stock broker you set your order to last 60 days and they process the order automatically when the price is triggered. Look at the info under your orders page and it should say how long the order will remain open. I think it would work without being logged in but I'm not positive.

Bid price was showing around 18.7k on coinbase for me, but ask was 19.6k. Does Coinbase skim the margin or something?

It's not just coinbase. The networks itself is having performance issues. I think Gemini suspended deposits/withdrawals to reduce new orders, and GDAX suspended trading for a bit. 
The thing I don't like about coinbase is they're tracking $2k above other exchanges right now, and the bid/ask spread is absurd.

Yeah, I think it's falling to 17k on coinbase

I think some people were in there buying and some were adjusting their stop loss orders, and it got overloaded with traffic. Then while client side of GDAX was down it probably triggered some sell orders which lowered the price.

Coinbase hit 19.7k buy and 18.7k sell before it crashed.
