If we want anything to overtake national currencies we have to go a different pathway - as long as we rely on them to accept us we won't get there. Just wrote something about that a very short time ago....

Was waiting for me, sorry I've straggled this week. Just bought, it'll move now!

That chart would make me plankton.... oy vay!

I like this explanation a lot, makes a whole lot of sense - yes, this will be VERY big!
@_date: 2018-01-14 00:18:44
Yes, this. 
Dealing with exchanges and markets is so nerve wrecking. This counts for both Bitcoin and alt coins; if I knew someone directly that I trusted who would be willing to sell it to me I would have had a much easier time and would have been much further along in my journey. I know there are tons of people like me and even less technically minded than me out here.....

I believe you because of one very specific thing you say about the future which most people don't know about but I do because my intuition gave me a heads up on it in regards to what this time frame is known as &amp; why you don't like traveling here.
So a few questions - I'm about to get into learning more about block chain &amp; crypto &amp; always sense I might innovate on something in the future with it. How close am I with this intuition?
One project is going to start with the letters Ko, it's a currency of sorts. The other is already in existence &amp; starts with the letters Ha - it's an organization / business. How influential will these things be in the future and am I on the right pathways with all of it? (If it's anything you'd recognize my name.) 
My second question is: Are there additional people messing with the timeline? The one thing that made me aware of my projects potential is that I had unusual opposition way too early in one of them.

If you don't consider including Women like me and my friends in your "hey crypto is cool and revolutionary technology" talk just because you don't think we grog it then yes Crypto is going to miss out automatically on 50% of the population. However few things are really marketed to us and we stick out like sore thumbs in the community and yet I'm a perfect example of a woman who fully believes in the tech and invests due to the future disruption of the financial sector - not just as a speculation lets get rich thing. I'm still learning, but I tell my friends about crypto and bitcoin; women too! Tweet about it too. Think about that for a moment; we're here and curious. Please don't exclude us or look down on us.....

I remember the early days of the internet, but even then I was part of the adoption phase of it - since many people got AOL &amp; even we had dial up. Even so it was nothing like the internet is today. We do everything on the web now!
That's why I  know Bitcoin is still ways away from being adopted, all of us in 1998 - 2001 with the internet is much later than Bitcoin is now....
So 20 years from now Bitcoin and the whole block chain environment - it'll be unrecognizable from now.  It's not just a fad because just like the internet disrupted communication Bitcoin is going to disrupt banking, finance, store of value, investing, currency and so much more.

Yes and no.
It'll pick up steam in the next few years, but I think to truly reach that sweet spot will take about ten years. We're not that far into adoption yet as most people think, with something as awesome as Bitcoin you'll know when adoption hits full swing....
Amazing is that the value is already so high even though it's still early....

Very easy to sign up; that's so refreshing and so appreciated. 
But a simple newbie's guide for dummies would be helpful down the road. Have a pretty account now (  but don't know the first thing on how to use it - or limitations thereof. 
Do people have to use Lightning Network to use it (or do they just need Satoshis) and if so do I just give people my username so they get to my page or are there other things required. 
Got tons of followers; spread over two twitter accounts but not sure how crypto knowledgeable most of them are since I'm still learning....
Every time I think I grasp Bitcoin something else comes along that shows me I don't know much of anything.
Overall seems like a huge deal and something that would help adoption in a huge way. Thank you for building it.
