There's already a lightning network testnet. That you can use right now.

Great start. So now, the question is, why will 2018 mirror 2017
- Less enthusiasm from new investors? - Unlikely. There is supposed to be more adoption across the board from institutional investors and more retail investors - Green light.
- Regulation? - Well..Regulations are coming across the board. How heavy will they be? What will they be? Key areas (Taxation, Exchange regulations, others?) - Yellow Light
- Will the tech get better (allowing for less fees) and speedy transactions? - Yellow light (who knows)
Please add more thoughts or correct me if I'm wrong. Case for BTC to always be blue chip

Agreed on both points.  I have faith in the sense of store of value.

Such is the same with stocks. if you purchase before peak interest and the price keeps going up. Well, you're rewarded more.

Quick questions
1. Does Bitcoin have to be decoupled from the rest of the market?
2. If the above scenario does happen, does it lose it's value?
3. With LN Implementations will that bring BTC back to peer to peer currency status? (Minimization of fees, rather, almost no fees and lightning speeds?
4. What other things does BTC have going for it in the long term that helps to keep its long term HODL status?
Thanks yall.

Robinhood should be good, if you're looking for sole profit and trading purposes.
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:58:42
Is the lightning network live or not?
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:00:13
Wait. Walter Ryan, the lightning network is live?
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:41:18
quick q, who's they?
@_date: 2018-03-21 01:19:01
CIRCLE should be a good one. IDK if it's out yet.
 
Abra is good too.
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:10:50
And is there a tutorial somewhere on how to run a node and how to use the LN to transfer btc
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:53:58
I know about lightning labs, and blockstream but didn't know there was another one?
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:28:45
But remember, there were issues like bitcoins not going where they needed to and being lost forever? Issues like that being resolved, to me, means, that it is truly live.
