Other than decentralized payable content, how were none of those possible before? Those are happening right now without bitcoin. 
Also, when the issue is that we can't handle the volume of transactions on the network and that the fees per transaction is way too high, how is the solution microtransactions?

You can restore your trezor seed to other wallets as well, you don't necessarily need another trezor.

As someone commented on my original post, GDAX is technically the exchange, coinbase is the broker. Don't leave money on an exchange. Coinbase would be a little bit safer than leaving it on GDAX AFAIK, but the idea is that unless you control the private key of your crypto, you don't actually *own* it. You need to move your money/crypto from GDAX into your own wallet. Personally I use a hardware wallet, but unless you have really large amounts you should be fine with a software wallet. Check out the getting started link on the sidebar for more info on setting up a wallet. It's easier than it first appears.

Coinbase is an exchange, the idea is that you exchange your USD for crypto, or crypto for other cryptos, and then move it into your own wallet. You can get a hardware wallet, or a software wallet. You can search for tutorials on how to set up a software wallet (which I'd recommend). Probably a tutorial on the sidebar too.

True true. I do hear a lot about people who mine ether and then trade for other currencies like bitcoin, but I'm sure there wasn't that much though put into this graphic, haha.
