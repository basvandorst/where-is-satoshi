That is a fucking huge flaw.  It should be the other way round.   It isn't unheard of for a 24+ hour wait for 6 confirmations of a bitcoin transaction while greedy bastard miners are submitting blocks with zero transactions. Incredible.
All the while you have well meaning people willing to spend their own hard earned money on nodes which they run for free for the good of the network (And Barry Silbert and the Winklevoss Twins and the other 1% who own the vast majority of all bitcoins).  It's a fucking disgrace.

Fix your scalability issues and successfully navigate this coming hardfork(s),  then maybe, just maybe you can try to sell bitcoin as necessary in the successful functioning of a blockchain.
Bitcoin is nowhere near prime-time. In fact it is nowhere near the end of beta stages. So stop embarrassing yourselves by insisting it is the only thing that could ever make a successful blockchain.
And I have mentioned this before, the equivalent of 40 gallons of gasoline are burnt in the production of 1 bitcoin and it is an incredibly wasteful process right now.  All is required is one hot shot coder with a brainwave and bitcoin could be exposed as a very  wasteful, fragile method of doing digital currency.

I found this from the comment section of that article. Pretty Sad 
"I lost more money than I've ever had in my entire life. And it wasn't through negligence either, I had good wallet practise, separate my coins in different locations. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time; gox was still the only AUD exchange with any real volume, and I recently moved the majority of my coins there to do some trades and pay off my house. Within a couple of days, withdrawals were locked, and I lost almost everything I owned. I say almost, because I had some reserve coins in a blockchain.info wallet... which was also hacked and swept clean somehow (among others reporting the same story). I got really unlucky, twice, in 2 days.
You tell us to hang in there... but how? I have no bitcoin position anymore, and no money, and I certainly can't promote that experience to others.
I see gox being burned to the ground for this, everyone want's to see them burn, but surely, the very best that can POSSIBLY come from this, is that they are able to launch their new services, rebrand gox under new management, and do what they can to pay their debts over time? At least there's a chance. Many of us can't afford to just write it off, and I'm disappointed that the majority call for blood, and don't seem to give a toss about the many many people who lost big."
These people are so desperate for Gox to rebrand but that would be an absolute catastrophe for the ecosystem.  Can you imagine if all this started again?  How could bitcoin ever be respected again if that happened?

I don't just think they should have to donate to the network, but I think they should be banned from cherry picking lucrative transactions as they see fit. This causes the surreal situation where some blocks are added to the blockchain containing ZERO transactions. Why the fuck are they getting a 25 bitcoin bounty for adding a block which contains no transactions?  It is fucking insane.  The miners have far too much control and power and things need to change quickly.

How could they possibly be used for gaming when they are on the brink of total hardware failure due to being used 24/7 for many months?  Not only have GPU farm owners caused the price of AMD graphics cards to double, but they have flooded the used GPU market with cards that are basically on the brink of hardware failure (probably advertised as "Hardly used")
I am beginning to despise people with GPU farms. And if you think they wouldn't rip somebody off by selling a totally unprofitable farm to some unsuspecting newcomer you are badly mistaken.

Your "first in the game" status won't protect you forever. Especially if crypto takes off in a big way.  Bitcoin is incredibly slow compared to all other alts. Some transactions on your network can take 12 hours to confirm if a hefty fee is not paid to the miners.
@_date: 2014-09-09 12:03:06


Bollocks!   If just one of satoshi's bitcoins even exchanged wallets the entire bitcoin community would collectively shit itself,  and if his identity  were to be exposed I wouldn't be surprised if you guys were lining up around the block to offer to suck his dick.
Think of how the apple fanbois worshipped Steve Jobs, multiply that by at least a hundred and you are somewhere close to how the bitcoin community feels about Nakamoto.
@_date: 2014-05-02 16:25:26


That's if any miners bother to add the transaction to their block. Believe me, there are blocks added to the blockchain containing as little as 3 transactions

Why is it costing people money to run full nodes to help the bitcoin network?  Why aren't they paid a little.  The miners get a gigantic chunk (For doing fuck all on many occasions and adding zero transactions to blocks)  So I ask again.  Why aren't people who run full nodes 24/7 paid?

This is why it is crazy to allow miners to not only suck up 25 bitcoins for each block found, but to be able to charge high transaction fees as well. (Especially when they are only adding 1 transaction per block sometimes in order to be the first to solve the block)

"If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), uninstall all
earlier versions of Bitcoin, then run the installer (on Windows)"

You should be very worried that you can just slightly alter the bitcoin code and make a coin 4 times faster, 4 times more plentiful with a completely independent blockchain.  
Just shows how old and slow bitcoin is.  All you have is the first mover advantage (which explains the huge network).  If litecoin had been created just a few months after bitcoin it would have taken the number 1 spot a long time ago.  Look over your shoulders because that first mover advantage ain't going to protect you forever.
Just bear this in mind,  every cryptocurrency that has ever been invented after bitcoin is either as fast as bitcoin, or faster.  Nobody wants to invent a coin with a 10 minute confirm time because it is just not acceptable for daily use, especially with small purchases like coffee etc

Litecoin was totally immune to the spam attacks embarrassing your community a few weeks ago,  Charlie Lee (tried to warn the devs about it nearly 3 years ago but he wasn't important enough to be worth listening to apparently.
Your comment sums up the unparalleled arrogance of the bitcoin community.  Considering the events of the last few months you have very little to be arrogant about.  Bitcoin is embarrassingly slow even when your network isn't being spammed,  you had an unforseen BIP66 fork recently forcing people to have to wait for 30 confirmations before their transaction could be deemed legitimate, and the community is at war over the block size.
You think one of these coins is worth $280?  No fucking way.

@_date: 2015-07-09 10:53:39
You guys are trying to downplay this,  but your bip66 upgrade has been a disaster, whereas litecoin's transition to bip66 has been seamless.  Bitcoin is currently suffering major spam transaction attacks which litecoin is totally immune to because patched litecoin years ago.  He offered the patch as a pull request YEARS AGO but the bitcoin devs rejected it.
THIS SHIT MATTERS.  These are tangible problems that bitcoin has that Litecoin is immune to.   So keep upvoting total lies to the top of the front page and hope it deflects attention from the real issues.  Anyone with more than two brain cells knows what is going on.

The bitcoin blockchain isn't fit to be used in this way,  thats why you need a fuck ton of private corporations bolting shit on top of it in order to make it work (They harvest all your personal data which can then be sold or hacked).   One day a blockchain will emerge that is capable of functioning how you describe,  but if you think bitcoin is it, you are an idiot, (or have a financial vested interest which causes you to have to hype it up).

I have a feeling that by the end of 2016 you people won't be anywhere near as arrogant as you have been over the past three years. All bitcoin has is the fact that it was created first. This gave it a huge network effect which it doesn't deserve.   It is the prototype.  Prototypes very rarely become the dominant end product.
Bitcoin is 4 times slower than the slowest altcoin and you can barely work together as a community to even get the most basic changes made to move bitcoin forward.

Because it's the only possible way you could ever get bitcoin to work with micropayments.

For the last 6 years in the UK we have had INSTANT bank transfers, we have had chip and pin for a decade and we are now moving on to contactless debit cards.
Just because Americans have been living in the financial banking dark ages it doesn't mean the rest of the developed world have.  Crypto is a harder sell over here because the banking system operates much more efficiently.
Of course all this depends on fiat which has to fuck off into the pages of history.  
However, rather than seizing on this momentous shift and bringing cryptographic currencies into the forefront you twats would rather refer to all other alts as "shitcoins"  and squabble amongst yourselves for the best part of a year about the fucking blocksize.

From the butthurt comments here you circlejerkers are getting worried.  Normally when there is a bitcointalk outage (which is fucking frequent)  and people complain about it here you guys say "Well if you don't like it create a competing forum and people will go there."
Well guess what?  Somebody has made a competing forum and considering the mammoth AMA it held two weeks ago it is THE place to go right now, unlike this shitstain of a subreddit or bitcointalk.

I suppose sidechains will cure world hunger and disease as well?   The fact that you even need sidechains / blockstream / lightning network means bitcoin isn't fit for purpose.

People on this subreddit are already trying to insinuate that public keys were shared amongst people in the very early days so that makes signing the genesis block useless.  I think much more irrefutable information will be forthcoming over the next few days making most of you look like imbeciles.
Also there are a significant number of people on this subreddit who would still be in denial if CW started moving the satoshi bitcoin stash.

You can't even fix your transaction malleability attacks.  You are going nowhere.

You need medication.  And judging by the general reaction today you guys would continue to make pathetic excuses why it wasn't true even if he started moving the satoshi bitcoins around

If he is Satoshi then he will have many ways of proving it which he may well do over the next few days.

To say bitcoin is in uncharted waters is an understatement.   The network effect it has will evaporate very quickly with the way things are going.

Do you not feel like a mug for doing that?  Miners can get a 25 bitcoin reward per block even if they just include 1 transaction in that block and you are forking out $150 bucks to support a network that is incredible wealthy for free!

Even if he did this toxic community is already conjuring up the excuses,  he stole the coins,  he bought the private keys off Hal Finney ( . He has kidnapped Satoshi and has him captive in his basement.
