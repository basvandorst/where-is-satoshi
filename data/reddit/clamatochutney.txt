Monarchs run at 700 GH/S with a power efficiency among the best in the industry at 0.70 W/GH. As a reward for our customers’ patience and loyalty, we are adjusting hashing power for existing orders in the queue to $1.97/GH (for 700 GH, effectively $1,379). Shortly before a customer’s order is ready to ship, they will receive details about their individual options.






 


 


 


This was the email that was sent this morning with those pictures.  I was an early ~~adopter~~ sucker.  
I ended up filing a chargeback from my credit card and was responded with some very rude emails from their staff because I was not patient.  They had missed out on the 50ghs units by over 9 months with no updates.

The "Your order has been Shipped" message is BFL cancelling your order.  If you notice you will now have a "Refund" tab when you go to your account &amp; invoices. 
It freaked me out as well but they do it to buy more time from the charge-back from paypal.  They send a false flag to paypal to get a full 45 days to return the money you gave them.
This tactic is another shady reason to never do business with them.  They try to paypal to cancel the charge back by giving a "Shipping Update" status.
