Lol. so was I, and I bought a shit ton at that previous high. And if we went there, I'd buy alot again. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 04:22:04
I love this
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:34:54
Yea, so why didn't I sell at $19k then right? It's a slippery slope man. I'm not a day trader and I have a full time job, timeing the market isn't something I can really do with ease. I hodl because I fear losing Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:37:08
It's more like a funnel. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:10:37
This was me back last fall. I bought back in to one to gain more BTC, of course I lost. I'm more uspet with myself than losing the BTC, I know better than that. I'm human though and I'm quite fine with all the BTC I have!
@_date: 2018-01-05 04:35:28
Shit. I looked

Lol 2x. You mean that coin that wasn't even properly coded and bombed out? I kind of wish 2x would have happened as well. That massive fuck up would have killed it upon arrival. I don't understand how people can't see that the only devs that are even worth a damn are in Bitcoin. There is a reason why we call all other coins shitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:26:47
This is on my bucket list. I should see if any of my miners have found a block. lol I never check. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:09:57
Be careful. This alt coin boom will come to a halt soon enough. Money will flow back into Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:47:36
If it went to $1300 I would wipe my savings for it. I just hope if it does get that low it doesn't take two years to get to. Lol. I doubt it would, things are different now. Honestly, $1300 would be rough but I would be soooo excited with how much i could buy. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:24:01
But even if it only ever went to $100k that's still good money to be made. People only see the gains they could make, which is unfortunate. Even if we don't make any gains, it's still sound money and im very ok storing it in Bitcoin vs a USD bank.

too bad their prices wont be on coinmarketcap since they wont list exchanges that dont have fees. Im really starting to grow a hatred for that website.

This argument is becoming weaker and weaker as the days go on and the mempool clears from Segwit and LN adoption. This just reminds me so much about the last election and all the bullshit I would hear from people that was just completely false and made up. It can only last so long until it dies out because the argument simplh isn't valid.

Sooo if propaganda tactics is us trying to stop a Twitter handle from spreading lies, then yea I guess it's propaganda. Lol. The narrative of the Bcash crew is so fucking weak.

What are you talking about? Inflation? It's a deflationary currency. Plus, a vast majority of these shitcoins are also minable. I don't understand your logic to own a coin that isn't minable if that's what you are saying. Usually in that case the owners/devs own a good percentage of the coins. So why is that any different from the miners owning Bitcoin in your scenario you laid out? I thinj your confused. You're gonna get rekt owning these shitcoins. When the alt bubble pops, whenever that may be, you will regret it. I'm super happy I sold my alts. Some it was the right decision others I missed out on some profits, but I'm fine with that since ALL of the alts are 100% pure speculation. I don't understand your logic.

My cube mate was saying the same shit today too. As always he went to his Apocalypse scenario and explained why it's not worth anything. This guy loves to think I'm gonna give a fuck about gold when in his Apocalypse scenario all anyone will want is shelter and food, not fucking gold. "you'll want it, it has intrinsic value"...."ah can I fucking eat gold? No, no I can't. So no I don't give a fuck about it in your stupid cherry picked scenario". He loves that it's crashing, I told him I was expecting $4k to be the high last year so if it drops to $5k I'm all about that shit. Lol. Stupid fucking people man. Everyone's a fucking expert about nothing they understand

Sooo you don't think that if there is quantum computing they can't easily get into my normal savings or any other type of conventional banking systems? In that situation we would have much much more to worry about. So yea, quantum computing breaks everything, and it doesn't matter if my money is in Bitcoin, USD, stocks, or anything since it's all fucked. Actually I'd argue that if I have my private keys it's safer than having usd stored on my online banking website. The entire world is fucked in this scenario, but here you are spinning it as if only Bitcoin is only effected. Why are you even here? Clearly you hate this shit. If you want to spin it to the point where it needs to fit some agenda. Please cherry pick this post apart as well. I'd love to hear how you think my USD is safer in a bank if quantum computing is available to some bad people.

Once the market recovers and realizes SK didn't even matter, onward up we go. I also think it is retarded coinmarketcap took SK out of all their statistics.

I would expect if the price of Bitcoin ever gets that high we are buying in lower denominations. Exactly, ain't no one buying that high. I think once we get to $50k it's time to lower the denomination for trading, maybe even make an argument for changing this today. Gold doesn't trade by the ton..

Your argument makes no sense. Why the fuck does it matter if someone is a Gardner or lawn mower? Will they not need Directions ever? Or to check their bank account? Or fire off an email? I could go on. Why is it you think smartphones are so popular? Why does almost everyone in the world have one? Because of how efficient they are and how much they have changed our daily lives and allow us to quickly do something and continue on with what we were doing.

You entire comment is based off of gambling to make major gains. I was only pointing out that if Bitcoin was only ever worth $100k in value, it's still worth putting your money into something like Bitcoin. Speculative? This argument is becoming weaker and weaker with the amount of adoption and new layered technologies being rolled out. Bitcoin has literally become the internet of money. All these alt coins are 100% speculative considering NONE of them are being used for their real world use case. The only one being used for its real world use case is Bitcoin.

TRON IS THE NEXT BITCOIN. I got buddies who were against buying Bitcoin now in the market claiming these shitcoins like ripple and Tron have better technology and innovation than Bitcoin. Lol they can't even be bothered to understand that both those coins have billions and billions of units, but here they are thinking it can even read $1k. I tried to explain to then what kind of insane market cap it would have to be to make it even to $100 for those two shitcoins. This is why we need everyone to adopt the bits denomination. I've asked around and everyone I know who will not buy right now, would totally buy some bits for pennies.

It's easier to buy a Bitcoin than mine it always. If miners dropped off the network it would take longer to find a block but the network adjusts difficulty every 10 days so eventually it would be back to 10 minute blocks anyway.

It's a phrase people use when they try to discount bitcoins 2nd layer solutions. Im not surprised the Bcash crew, the crew who says "more highway lanes is the way to scale". I'm not surprised their only argument left is "technical debt". It's early days, this will evolve and it will become easy for anyone to use. This kind of excuse just makes me cringe.

I don't think Roger actually knows how Bitcoin works. Lopp is talking about how it would become Centralized to run a node due to large block size. Only companies would be able to validate blocks via full nodes becuase the disk space would be too large for the average person. Roger responds by talking about the miners spending "thousands of dollars" for miners. Either he's brain dead, doesn't understand the difference between nodes and miners, or is just trying to troll the topic. I'm leaning towards he doesn't understand. Bcashers eat this shit up. A majority of them I come across don't even understand the simplest of things in the network.

I'm well aware of a 51% attack. And I'm also well aware of how it's impossible to even do so. He amount it would cost is not even worth the time. Lol next. Oh, yea quantum computing, we will have bigger issues than just Bitcoin. Quantum computing breaks alot of shit, in fact all the shit. So you're right, cryptography will effectively be broken if/when quantum computing is a thing. If that kind of technology isn't responsibly rolled out, it would be catastrophic for many many many industries. If rolled out responsibly, what makes you think programmable money couldn't adapt for it? As for internet connected computer, if you store you shit on a dekstop, that's your own fault for being so stupid. Literally everything you just said is the talking points of people who try to discount how amazing Bitcoin is. Bitcoin is my own money and it hasn't been this way for centuries.

How does an "experienced trader" chase bounces like this? For fucks sake I swear everyone knows that $7500 - $8k is the next support. Lol I'm sorry, but it's fools like this who need to lose their money for Bitcoin to proceed. I think a rational person would have just held and stopped after losing 50/300 btc.

You're argument is invalid. LN is already being rolled out. Say it was going to take 2 years, who the fuck cares. This is the internet of money being built by a community of people. Bcash is focused on making layer 1 better when it can't be made better without centralization. What's on the horizon for scaling in bcash? Nothing. Much bigger blocks. Lol. You can shill all you want man, your simple ass mind can't even comprehend what is being built or why it works or why bigger blocks isn't a scaling solution. I can't believe we still have to have this conversation. I can't wait for shitcoin eth to be worth more than bcash so it can just die.

This is just what I expect from the Bcash crew. There will never be full blocks? Lol why? I'm sorry you have fallen for this clearly insane narritve. Larger blocks is not scaling. I don't think you know what scaling even is. Larger blocks is just throughput. This is a CS 101 topic. To scale there needs to be infrastructure to support it. This is an internet of money being built with a layered approach. Larger blocks is lazy and counter productive.

Literally as the mempool has cleared up and sending tansactions have been cheap. Plus the added fact LN is rolling out, I'm thinking maybe they didn't want to spend the time to implement LN. We need more devs in this space and that's for sure. Can't wait for the alt bubble to pop and plenty of devs are available. I wish I had time myself to become one, maybe one day if Bitcoin provides me financial freedom.

and they aren't even fucking trading bitcoin. its all cash settled. its just ridiculous what this stupid ass futures shit has created. part of me thinks futures were only created to try to kill bitcoin, obviously they will not succeed.

I could give a shit about this score. Ironic they do it right before LN is rolled out on a mass scale. Let's revisit in 1 to 2 years and see what it is. I'm convinced they chose this number before doing any research. Fucking criminal.

You sound like the owner judging by your quick name calling. That's how he treats people on Twitter. So what if it's free? Why would I still want to install and use software from a group of individuals who side with scammers? I've interacted with them on Twitter and they are known bcash shills. No fucking way that software is touching my PC or phone. I don't give a shit if it's open source. I

Ok fine, but that doesn't mean it can't be done if smaller teams were able to complete this. I also assume it depends on the complexity of their back end, which if it is a cluster fuck, yea it could be hard to implement. At that point the complexity is 100% their fault and not segwit. I think St this point we can assume coinbase is in this very same scenario. I assume their back end is a absolute cluster fuck.

That’s because no one is issuing the network. Either you don’t want to say why the fees are low or your simple ass mind can’t understand it. what would the fees look like if the bcash blocks were full? Doubt you’ll answer. Everyone just trolls when I ask that question. Bcash hasn’t solved scaling one bit. When their blocks are full you’re back to where bitcoin is right now. Doubt you’ll also admit segwit is scaling and the mempool would be clearer out of these exchanges would implement it.  These exchanges are creating fake chaos like these governments are doing. It’s the exact reason why I own bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:32:38
I stopped reading. This post is almost as bad as all the "I sold" posts. It's all about USD this USD that, I honestly could care less. I buy and hodl Bitcoin for a future where u can use if as is. That's why I hodl. Could I get rich in the short time? Sure, but I'm not here to get fiat rich.

Nah. I think that’s an awful idea. Go on coinmarketcap and look at the top ten 6 months ago, a year ago. Alts are a crapshoot and 100% a gamble. I’d Noah be only think about owning some litecoin. Even then, history shows me that it was still more profitable to own bitcoin, unless you got in on litecoin at single digits. I’d rather diversify into stocks...maybe. I’m skeptical of just about anything that’s not bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:57:34
Its coinbase. Before I even type in the amount to move out it defaults to $32. I can only assume they are hard coding this value. This is why I'm done with them. This angers me so much. I am shocked as to how they have not been hacked yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:37:07

You're mentioning different protocols in different layers. TCP/IP is in the network layer and HTTP is in application layer, then you throw in some HTML. What are you even comparing?

Same here. Friends and family think I’m nuts for not taking at least some profits. I know I’m the minority at work and home, but I’m the majority here on this sub. I tell them I’m not a fucking day trader and who knows if it’s going down or up or sideways, I ain’t got time for that shit. Sure in hindsight I could own more bitcoin, but I also could own less if I tried and failed. Can’t lose bitcoin if I don’t sell bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:38:04
I agree. I understand that holding your bcash is a hedge, but even just holding it is supporting it. I don’t care that I dumped mine at $350, it felt great.

What disturbs me more is the all the selling posts for houses or "a greater life", and then I get shit on for calling said person out because selling Bitcoin for a better life now isn't what I signed up for. I get it, some are older and in different situations than I am, and I won't argue with an older person cashing out, but there are too many people cheering on someone who made it "rich" by selling what I consider not life altering money. Sure I could sell now and pay off my entire house, but that's not why I'm in Bitcoin. I'm not in it to pay off debt right now...I'll suffer for a while more. I'm not saying is someone made millions not to sell, I'm seeing posts about people who sell all or almost all for something in the moment now. It's cancerous and they will regret it. Where is the discipline? This sub used to be all about hodling until we don't even need to cash out, now we just cheer the guy who cashed out to sell off his house, or that idiot that cashed out for his kids college fund and the kid is 1 year old. Lol that shit Fiat will be worth less than half when that kid can actually attend college, plus the added fact college rates go up. Idk, maybe I'm just a purest, but i feel blessed that I have a wife that allows/trusts me enough to hodl out for something better. My next house will be bought in Bitcoin in the next 3-5 years. Even then I expect that to be a fraction of what I own. Stop cheering on these cashing out posts, they too are the weak hands.

I bet you are sitting here complaining about it and you yourself haven't even put a thought into help testing it. GTFO OP, these posts are just retarded. We aren't a corporation and LN will be tested and tested and tested until it's deemed workable. Development is slow when dealing with programmable money, just look at the ETH space as an example as to what happens when development isn't done right. It's beyond me why eth is still even alive.

You're just cherry picking shit man. Jesus Christ. When I buy something in Bitcoin I turn around and buy the same exact in Bitcoin right away. Like right fucking away. Lol I'm done here. Of course the price goes up and down, which is why I replace it immediately. For purchases under $20 I most likely won't though. Why do I do this? Because I believe in the technology, and usually the places you buy from that accept Bitcoin will charge less because they aren't the one paying the fees, the buyer is. Are you new to this shit? Do you not know how this all works? Lol. Go away. 
Edit: I looked at your account and it's clear your a paid shill. Either that or you live in your mom's basement. Idk anyone who could comment as much as you do and hold a full time job. All you do is comment negatively on this sub and you do it at a rate I've never seen before. This is my last response, get a fucking life you scrub.

People keep telling me to take profits. As someone who got into bitcoin as a hedge against fiat, the term “profits” makes no sense to me. How am I taking profits by selling bitcoin and ending up with less bitcoin? Sure we are pegged to the USD right now, but there could be a future where we are not. Who knows what could happen in ten years. Ten years in the real world is like 10 thousand in bitcoin years. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:38:57

Hwo much you want to bet it's worth 1/4 of what it is now for college in 18 years. I seriously hate all these cashing out posts. They are cancer. Why are we buying Bitcoin? To get rich? That's not why I'm buying. Sure it would be cool in the long run but I'm buying because I fiat is shit and bitcoin is the best store of value in the world.

Where did I say I would never use it? I don't have enough to retire if I sold at $100k. I'm looking for life changing money and I will continue to work like I don't have any until then. And if it never comes I'm sure I will be able to retire ealeir because of it and I will for sure use it then. I look at this as my retirement nest egg. I'm sure if it reaches $100k tomorrow and rated there I'd have to reevaluate but for now that's how I feel. I love how people just assume I'd buy and never use it...lol like wtf, what's the purpose at all for owning it then? You're dumb. 
Edit: also, I believe if we went to $100k and crashed it would have been the bubble popping and I'd be waiting for the next rise. Have you not seen how this works?

Dear noobs, welcome, and realize you bought high. Could we already go up to $25k? Sure. But we could also drop. I bought high St $1800, $2500, $4400, $5300, and lastly at $10900. I'm up so much we would have to crash to $2500 for me to even feel slightly concerned. Even then I'd still be in a buying frenzy.

I've seen plenty of pictures on this sub from all different businesses where they will charge even 15% less for an item or good. It makes sense since they don't have to pay the credit card fee. Any good business is competing, so why wouldn't they offer a service or good cheaper if they could? You should know, you are on this sub commenting at an inhuman rate.

@_date: 2017-12-12 00:19:44
At this point, I'm buying my Lambo for wayyyyy less Bitcoin. God I can't wait to only use Bitcoin in the next 5 - 10 years. All the businesses who jump on board first will benefit. I will gladly spend bitcoin over USD any day of the week....even if that involves me replacing it right away for now. Wouldn't have to do that if I was paid in Bitcoin or I could convert to Bitcoin immediately (the entire check)
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:16:13
I can't stand these posts. Eveyone in it just for the benefit. Meanwhile I'm here hodling paying my monthly mortgage because I'm waiting until I can pay it in Bitcoin. Fuck cashing out, I want to use it. I consider these posts in line with the weak hands. Downvote the fuck out if me, I don't care. In tired of these cancerous cashing out posts...that's not what Bitcoin is to me and it's not what our idealogoy is. That neo meme sums it all up. It's quite shocking how people can't bare to suffer the slightest. I'm in it for the long haul. Wake me up at $500k and maybe I'll consider using some to buy a house. Keyword 'using'. Not cashing to fiat. Fuck that.

Lol and we are cripple coin. God they are awful. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:51:21
You’re retarded if you think I’m hating on coinbase for them adding a crypto.

It’s getting out of hand on this sub. First balls, now cookies. What’s next, spaghetti?

@_date: 2017-12-26 02:20:18
I can’t. I don’t watch and listen to the MSM like sheep.

Fuck this guy. He's a sellout and a bcash shill
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:14:15
Unfortunately I’ve been stuck with coinbase. This ends today. When I get home from work I will be signed up on Gemini 
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:37:58

@_date: 2017-12-13 17:45:23
It’s sad that we know all these names of the bad actors but the developers who actually devote their lives to developing for the greatest good are much less well known. Just a shower thought. Fuck Garzik and no one will want this shitcoin.

Gonna see that more and more soon. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:22:34
I don't go around correcting people on the internet about their spelling when my main usage of Reddit is through my phone and I fat finger shit all the time. You win Mr great speller. I didn't point yours out because I honestly could give a fuck about your spelling. I can about what someone is saying not how they spelled their shit. Lol go away. You're really annoying. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:13:05
Oh god you're such a tool. "Corrects" my logic by supplying logic for a different scenario completely and then corrects my spelling because you clearly don't understand.

Divorce her. I spent plenty of time talking to my wife and explaining to her what bitcoin is and why it's a safe guard against the government. We use dollar cost avg to buy. 
First sentence was a joke btw

Look at the charts then look at bitcoins chart.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:28:44
God damn. So many stupid people on here. Suck it up butter cup and keep paying off those loans for financial freedom down the road. Sure I could pay off 3/4 of my house right now and pay way less per month and save more...but I'm hodling out for something better. I really don't understand these people. It's like people can make sacrifices. Maybe OP for hear from the wife. I'm blessed with the best wife in the world placing all her trust in me. I think posts like these are cancerous...OP going to be kicking himself in the ass when this bitch gets pumped to $100k. Are people just unaware of the hedge funds not opening until Jan 1? Or the CME futures trading? Lol all you guys selling now for something so short term are gonna regret ever selling when you could have just sucked it up for a couple years. Not to mention the halvening in 2020. Like for fucks sake I don't get this selling mentality when there are so many things on the horizon. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:30:13
I don’t keep my coins on coinbase. So your stupid assumption that I’ve had plenty of time to move them is as stupid as you are. Youre simple ass brain couldn’t even think that maybe I bought some bitcoin and it just became available to me to move.  Takes a week for the bank funds to clear. I move them immediately off of coinbase. I’m not a rookie here pal, i don’t keep any of my bitcoin on an exchange. I’ve been sending segwit transactions from my hardware wallet with fees for much less. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:55:33


Lol I love this
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:54:41
Sorry, but I hate it. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:58:33
In terms of BTC, it's no where near it's ath. In USD however it is. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:33:32
This is where your simple ass mind can't understand the true power. It's not backed by any government and that's it's BEST feature. Go look at Venezuela and tell me how their government backed fiat is. Look at the us dollar and how money is printed daily and loans given out create money out of thing air. Lol oy, how can someone who is commenting on this sub be so blind. You must be lost. I suggest you start reading and watching andreas Antonopoulos my friend, before you lose all your hard earned peices of paper. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:28:31
Why what?
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:04:40
So much truth to this
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:56:57
Bcash is an alt. This whole sub considers it an alt. Ergo is an alt coin sub. I can’t believe we are even bickering about this. I don’t care about 2010, this is 2017.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:30:27
Then I guess you hate bcash too because decisions about their network are made behind closed doors, which is centralized. Whos idea was it to change the EDA? You're argument is invalid.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:17:33
Got busy with something else. I have 5 days off coming up later this week, it’s on the schedule for Thursday. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:13:02

@_date: 2017-12-11 23:33:05
Wait wait wait, LN can go down lower than a Satoshi?
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:26:02
...but down in value
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:21:47
Because they were prepared for 2x but have not implemented segwit when they know damn well they could be saving us money. I just spent $32 in fees to move my bitcoin to my hardware wallet. It doesn’t have to be this way. I can easily send it with much lower sat/byte and have it go through. You gonna hit me with some kind of bullshit as to why this doesn’t happen on bcash aren’t you. I can feel it in my bones. I wonder how many people will fall for this, when in reality bcash hasn’t done anything for scaling at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:31:34
Oh and they know it. At this point I will be stunned if the implement segwit. They are all creating fake chaos on the network just like these governments create fake chaos to push their agenda. It’s so fucking clear to me. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:01:44
Lol is this a joke? The media only reports negative news about Bitcoin. Headline "Bitcoin crashes 30%" and they all lose their shit. Have you not seen the Fox news article about Bitcoin being at a 3 year low?
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:24:39
When people ask how much I have, I like to follow up with a question on how much is in their savings. Usually they don’t want to tell, or it’s “I’ll tell ya if you want to know”. They still don’t understand how I see it sometimes when I won’t tell them. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:34:29
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:59:44
Ah. Sorry I misunderstood ya. I would think they can at least prove the keys were linked to my account in their database. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:27:17
As much as I would love to see this, no one does this because we aren’t the bad actors in bitcoin. What goes around comes around, it’s a slippery slope. I hate the shit out of bcash, but that is not the way. Letting it die naturally is so much sweeter. Don’t feel bad when they lose all their money. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:51:48
I don't understand why so many people can't just sacrifice for a bit. I don't get it. OP gonna hate himself this time next year because his property isn't worth as much as his Bitcoin could be. Lol I got in thousands before $5k and I still wouldn't even think of cashing out for a house. Especially not when no one knows how high the sky is. I just don't get it. Why are so many people cashing out after what I would consider small profits compared in the long run. Im in this for the long haul fellas, I'm not cashing out and abandoning the currency for shit Fiat and a down payment, my next house will be bought with bitcoin in the next 3 - 7 years. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:47:59
Using your logic then Bcash is bitcoin. Doesn’t make sense. There can’t be two. It’s a fork of bitcoin. Again using your logic bgold is also bitcoin and not an alt. This makes no sense. There isn’t two bitcoins and I don’t use two internets.

You're wrong. If they would have stolen the physical device that would be just fine. You can recover the wallet on another hardware wallet or using oher desktop wallets. This is why the 24 word seed is more valuable.

That ain't a crash buddy
@_date: 2018-09-19 12:05:14
I agree. All it means is someone didn't hodl and clearly isn't in Bitcoin for the right reasons. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:28:43
Lol god I live this sub. I lol’ed pretty hard. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:29:12
You my friend get it. These retards who think this shit can just be implemented and made super fast usually don’t have a technical bone in their body. Could you imagine the devs pushing out code that broke the system, even slightly? Shit could go to zero super fast. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:29:47
For sure. Completely agree. We need segwit to be adopted first. This is why I’m leaving coinbase. Coinbase knows if they implement it bcash is DOA. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:41:06
Guess you aren’t interested enough in bitcoin to know LN exists. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:55:32
People can send bitcoin out of the exchange right? 
@_date: 2018-09-17 12:33:49
No, just no. You have to be joking.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:47:04
I certainly have no clue how the fed reserve works. Try to tell me miners are the most important thing in Bitcoin and youre gonna hear an all day conference about how what nodes do for the network though. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:58:50
I’ll be on Gemini before the day is over. First thing I’m doing when I get home. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:15:05
Like that Fox News link I saw on here. Complete fucking lie. I hated the media before I was in bitcoin and my hated for them just continues to grow. There is no journalism anymore. Just a bunch of plebs talking out their assholes and my buddies all eat that shit up. Me? I keep buying.  
@_date: 2018-09-04 12:30:55
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:27:42
That is the exact opposite of what a decentralized currency needs. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:51:28
Has he achieved it? Look at prices for college 18 years ago vs today. He's cashing it out for Fiat....we won't even have cash then. So much unknown. This is why I Bitcoin, store of value. I stand by saying these cashing out posts are cancerous. I'm hodling for a technology and future I believe in. Sure I could cash out most now and it would take me out of the middle class, but I'm not looking to get rich quick.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:13:07
Fuck coinbase and anyone associated with it. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:06:26
He also laughed at me for buying in May. This shirt was given to me as a Christmas gift from my brother in law. It’s my favorite.

You're 100% delusional. You need help. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:58:25
I can't do this. They will figure it out when they see me in my (rented) lambo
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:29:10
Can’t gain by selling bitcoin for fiat if we are buying bitcoin to get out of fiat 
@_date: 2018-09-09 12:13:32
OP cleanly is the example of people who say they know what bitcoin is and has no fucking clue. I call them pseudo intellectuals. There are a ton of them and they are so easy to shit all over. Lol a hedge against inflation and fiat is WHY bitcoin was created. OP please go read a fucking book. You clearly are uninformed. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 13:18:06
Because storing you Bitcoin on a desktop wallet is retardedly not safe. I would never keep my private keys on a desktop. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:56:16
It's hardly even that anymore. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:06:40
Fuck I need an exchange for? I'll find some rando on Reddit or Twitter and do an atomic swap. Banks became irrelevant in 2009.
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:20:59
Couldnt have said it better. Even the simplest of things people reach out to ask me a question about something tech related a 2 second Google search would provide. Sometimes it even ends up in then googling after asking me because they didn't like the answer and the Google search provides the same answer. Lol it's truley said. Thank God I went to school for my CS degree and have a burning passion to learn something new everyday about it.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:55:27
Lol I need to call them this from now on
@_date: 2018-09-06 02:57:07
Sorry. I dont believe in fairy tales 
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:50:45
Ah! So this is why I would put in the custom fee and see a Lowe sat/byte when I checked the transaction. Wtf. Good to know. That’s ridiculous. All of this is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:56:10
For real. She thoughts and arguments are so clear and consise. I love listening to him and reading his books!
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:29:00
Segwit IS a block size increase. If all these exchanges started to use Segwit we would have 4mb blocks. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:49:21
Then you're paying the amount that guy is selling it for, which is most likley absurd, which leads back to limited supply leads to higher prices. It's very very simple. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:52:24
I tried trading before, never lost usd but sure dude lose btc. I’m glad I stopped before I lost and amount I couldn’t buy back. I also dumped all my alts months ago before this bull rush. Best decision I’ve ever made. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:09:28
But a block size increase isn't a solution now. That's a centralized bandaid that isn't even a bandaid. You big blockers can't simple even think for one second, "what happens when those blocks are full?". I'm tired of having to say this to stupid people. Sorry. You're stupid. We would fill those blocks in an instant and be right where we are today. It's as simple as that. Look at bcash, if those blocks were full, they would have higher fees than we do right now. This whole, I NEED IT NOW NOW NOW mentality is fucking retarded, just like you. In gonna call you out and call you a retard because it's retarded. It's not scaling and to scale we have segwit and LN with more on the horizon. Do you not read this sub? Scaling is coming, and coming soon. But unlike the bcashers, it's being tested and tested and tested and tested and tested until it's deemed working. This is programmable money, not a fucking iPhone app. This shit can't crash, ever. These types of posts are cancerous and I I'm glad they don't get deleted so I can come on here and tell you how stupid and ignoratn you are. Yea I'm cokcu but I don't have to be if your not here saying we need a which fix now, that's how you break shit. This isn't a corporation....we do things properly. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 02:51:26
Everyone on here talking shit calling tone out like its already a bull market needs to sftu. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:50:57
Same here. One co worker is fascinated by it and we talk about the technicals daily, while I got another guy just dead set on its fining to be dead because of &lt;insert reason here&gt;. The guy who always trashes it is a miserable person so I’m not surprised. Even his “it takes up too much electricity and will fail because of it” argument is weak. People will utilize mining to pay for sustainable energy in the future. Andreas Antonopolous explained it best, it creates decentralized electricity. Seriously can’t find one bad thing about about bitcoin. I always take time to help people understand and I will go out of my way to do so. Besides the miserable fuck, I’ll help anyone. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:38:08
I wouldn't be shocked if we saw that at the next halvening. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:48:28
And this is the exact reason why I don't think a crash to $1300 is possible. I'm seeing people on my FB feed talking about it...people I never would have thought talking about it. Too much is going on and too many eyes on it. Please give us at $5k dip though one last time!
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:59:20
Ah, I guess you've never heard of viruses or hacking. This is the only reason why desktop wallets are unsafe. I would never be so ignorant go think my private keys are safe on a dekstop pc, no matter the amount of precautions I could take. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:47:07
Yea for real. People who can dump the market could easily trade futures and make money while they dump BTC, then buy low and it's a win win. Let's hope this happens, I for one would love a 60% correction so I can accumulate more. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 03:38:30
Yup. Hodl is peace. Hodl and buy the dip!
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:33:10
I know what I’m doing today. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 03:30:16
The guy is more pro bitcoin than half of Twitter and YouTube. People are butt hurt by his calls but I watch the guy walk around giving it straight to these shitcoins. So I guess my definition of clown is different than yours. 
@_date: 2018-09-02 13:52:24
Yea, he chose to say he could easily say child porn wasnt a crime. I'll never forget it  
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:01:08
Lol right. It's sound money
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:01:34
Exactly. Wasn’t well thought out. This would also imply that the network would have to keep track of spam transactions and where do we store that? The full nodes? They already eat up enough hard drive space. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:38:02
Go get your flu shot so you can get sick
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:54:14

@_date: 2017-12-10 17:49:52
Why are we still even talking about that alt coin here?
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:21:44
I wish that was the case. It's probably part that but also in coinbases situation they want Bitcoin to be dead and clearly side with a coin they can control. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 03:40:02
I'm ready for it. I'm buying! Take it to $100, in still buying!
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:13:14
But they are all like, muh blockstream. It’s so easy to poke holes in anything they say. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:29:24
You need to be a better friend then and earn them the moment you know they are even interested in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:45:51
Lol. You're who I aspire to be. Upvotes for you. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:52:18
My co workers are telling me I need to take 20% off the top in profits. They see me profiting in USD as a win and if it crashed I would regret it. I told them idk whar they are talking about. If the USD value crashes I still have the same amount in Bitcoin. I'm not in this for a couple bucks, I'm in this for life altering money. Even then I won't start to use it until we stabilize or it moons fast. I'll never cash out, I'll only use it. They think I'm nuts.

Your assumptions are wrong. If you give me a choice to pay in Bitcoin vs USD, I would pay in Bitcoin every day of the week. I'm also a hodler so the very first thing I do is to replace the Bitcoin I just spent. I use it all the time for purchases on open bazzar. In fact, I will seek places out that use it to spend it vs USD. I will just never let the amount of Bitcoin I hodl go down, even while I spend it. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:45:42
Don’t care. I’m not interested in buying anything other than bitcoin. This is great for my use case.

My bank isn’t compatible and unfortunately I can’t set up a Gemini account with my current bank. I’m literally opening up bank account with TD to make transferring money to Gemini easy. I’m so fed up and done with coinbase I’m willing to open up a new bank account to use another platform. Thanks for the info on how to close it. Mine will be closed as soon as my Gemini is open, hopefully before the weekend.

@_date: 2017-12-09 19:24:36
It's my understanding there is no delivery right? So this makes it a completely different market and it's volume should be ignored in terms of Bitcoin trading volume. Especially since it's all cash settled. I was worried this would effect the price of Bitcoin much....I don't think it will. But hey we won't know until we know. Until then, it's just a betting platform for the price of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:57:50
You lucky some of a bitch. I'd do this in a heart beat if I could! For now I just buy when I can!
I'm also curious how they will handle paying you weekly with the price fluctionations. We are about to go even more parabolic maybe so I'm curious how they will handle it. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:00:22
Lol yup. Exactly
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:22:23
Why would you cash out almost all of it? I'd cash out enough for the house and maybe a car and hodl the rest. I also hate fiat so i never understand the whole cashing out shit when this is the whole reason we are buying. People just using Bitcoin as a vehicle to get rich (for now) I'm glad they sell.

I think your confused as to why I don’t like them. I don’t own any bch and during the split I didn’t have my coins on coinbase. In fact I never keep my coins on coinbase. Seeing as they can’t even implement segwit to allow me to send out my coins for less than fucking $20, I’m moving on. I’m easily sending transactions with 25-30 sat/byte (even lower sometimes) and paying little in fees. There is no reason coinbase cant do this. For fucks sake they have how much money, go hire competent devs, but it’s clear they don’t want to do that because they aren’t a bitcoin company...which is also clear. Fuck them. I’m moving to Gemini and I’ll wait as long as it takes to get verified. I’m done. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:24:20

Sure you can send it sms, but how will the Bitcoin netowork even work? Can they literally block peer to peer? I guess we could kiss multiplayer video games goodbye also.

Sucks for them. They will be missing out if they listen to you. I bet you don't know anything about the underlying technology and only see what's in front of you. Humanity has never done or seen anything like this before, yet here you are screaming tulips and being so sure of yourself when in fact no one knows how this ends. It's not irrational to put a responsible amount of money in even if you don't believe in where it is headed. My sister finally bought in right under $10k and she's buying responsibly and I see nothing wrong with this approach. You and your crew will be the last to hop on board and will own a very small fraction of what early dopters own. You see it as a tulip, I see it as a hedge against the American dollar, or any government backed shit fiat currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:41:00
You da real mvp. I bought high at $1800, $2500, $4400, $5300 and so on. Now I’m finally buying small increments all the way down. It’s going to be glorious going back up.

I just can't understand how you come to such a stupid conclusion. The guy doesnt like anything  but bitcoin and I've seen videos of him talking shit to the shitcoiners. He's said NUMEROUS times that all these shitcoins will die, but here you are calling him a shitcoiner. Jesus christ how on earth do you even come to such a dumb conclusion? That's like calling trump a Democrat. How are you this dumb?

Still $32 to remove $200 from coinbase. Utterly insane. My Gemini account is in the making. Need to bank wire the money first. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:56:20
This couldn't be more accurate. I was one of those who did a full circle from buying Bitcoin first, dabbled in alts and tried to trade, lost potential profits because I couldn't sell, came back to Bitcoin full throttle and dont own any alts. Bitcoin is peace of mind. 
@_date: 2018-09-02 20:14:36

Lol all these comments are about you and I suggesting to take out a loan to buy Bitcoin when neither of us had said that. OP could go a million routes to fund what sounds like his last year of college and not sell it Bitcoin, which a vast majority of people do in life...but here everyone is commenting that we are suggesting to take out a loan to buy Bitcoin. Never once suggested that and I never will. Y'all are retarded. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:11:35
If not after a correction... eventually it will. Think about it, anyone can buy Bitcoin with a $20 phone, and donut world wide. I understand why people think the marketcap could be $20 trillion. Will it ever get there...who knows. For now I treat all my bitcoin as if it's already with $1million. Even if it was that much I'm not cashing out, I'm buying things using BTC. Using this mindset also helps you secure you shit. Ain't no one keeping a million dollars on an exchange...well I bet some would.

Either you’re dense or a shill. First I’ll follow up, does anyone use bcash as a currency? No of course not.  2nd, of course it’s used as a currency, I’ve used it many of times this year to purchase things such as clothing off of open bazaar, or my vpn through private internet access every year, or anything off of overstock. For now when I use it to buy things, I replace it because I’m a hodler as well. Are you completely unaware of what is going on in Venezuela? I have friends who love there and bitcoin is preferred over their heavily inflated fiat. Bags of cash lay around and no one even cares. Bitcoin is what Venezuela is turning to as a store of value and a currency to even eat a fucking meal and plenty of places accept it. Lastly, if it wasn’t used as a currency, why would so many place put up signs around the world that say “Bitcoin accepted here”. I guess they just do it to be hip and cool or some shit. I spent way too much time on this but this is a retarded ass question and it’s clear asked as a “gotcha” when no other alt is even close to be used as a currency. So many sheep with such loose arguments. 
@_date: 2018-09-06 12:47:05
This guy is fucking drunk. Idk how you can come to such a stupid conclusion. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:25:25
For sure. No one knows. But what I do know today is that Bitcoin is deflationary and it halves in 2020, and Fiat is printed every day and is inflationary. I like to use this knowledge to my advantage.

@_date: 2018-08-28 14:11:24
False. He was saying that $1300 was never correctly tested, therefore it was never outside the possibility to come back and test $1300. The guy is the biggest proponent of bitcoin but here everyone is shitting on him. Lol the guy literally goes around to these crypto conferences confronting all these shit coin companies face to face. Gtfo 
@_date: 2018-08-29 12:21:37
He's not really making predictions, his channel is all about learning. He travels around teaching at seminars. Sure he's calling for $1300, but to him its technically possible. I dont understand markets st all, but I know enough to know that listening to anyone you're gonna get rekt. If someone says they know where the price is going,  and you follow them, you're an idiot.

I knew it was going lower. Could have sold some at $7400 to take some profits but I'm not in it for the short game. I want as much Bitcoin as I can get. It's clearly going lower. If I buy lower and it looks like it will go lower, I'll sell Lower to. As for my initial investment, I'll never sell all I bought in 2017, that shit I'm just hodling until death.

Think about how many people don't own it but will in the future. In the very near future 1 Bitcoin will be unobtainable by most, you could argue it already is. 
Edit: I can't read. Keep working hard man, you shall get there. I read about others who have worked so hard to earn one, and I'm convinced even a fraction of one will be well worth the effort in the future.

No fuck that. We have bcashers parading around crypto twittedr and Reddit claiming bcash is Bitcoin scamming noobs and simple minds into buying their scam. Keep the foot on the fucking gas. We are a community and unlike Roger, we aren't funded by money but by open source and consensus. Fuck Roger, keep exposing him for the horrible little angry scammer man he is.

I'm a Bitcoin Maximalist. It actually could probably be more but in clearly an awful trader. I have this sub to thank for EVERYTHING. Someone here stopped me from dumping all my money into mining. This sub also taught me how to hodl and buy the dip. As to when I started buying, I'm 100% lucky. Hodl and buy the dip, eventually you will catch that bottom. I still believe we will be going way past $20k, who knows in the short term though. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 12:50:16
While you're there wanting to use a cc for points, I'm here wanting my own money. This is why I'm in Bitcoin, it's MY money. No one can take that away from me. If you haven't watched videos from Andreas Antonopoulos you need to. You're going about this the wrong way. In my mind it's pointless to be in Bitcoin if I'm not going to use it. Lightning network is growing every day, and you're phone will/has become your new wallet. Bitcoin is protection. Protection against corrupt governments and there is nothing they can do about it. Propaganda my asshole, it's called being informed. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 02:54:21
Yea. It all sounds like gambling to me...in a market that already feels like gambling. Fuck that. I've bought and hedl and I highly doubt I'd have this much if I traded.

As much as I hate bitcoin cash....this is a stupid ass comparison since everything is in USD but you chose to make BCH paired to bitcoin. Again, fuck bcash, but also fuck making it seem like something it's not. We dont play those games here. Do that shit on r/btc

Oh I 100% agree. Youre being financial responsible with your money, I want to make that clear. I still need to look into opening once because my savings feels like a trash can. If Bitcoin did one thing, it was make me realize that savers are the only people who get hurt, you need to put your money into other things that grow over time. I'm always shocked at the amount of people that live day to day and week to week...and I know some who make a great deal of money who live month to month. They look rich on the outside and have no fucking savings...one has even made fun of me and I laughed at it because he's in debt up to his eyeballs. I'm just glad as an adult I realized the importance of having money, it has allowed me to put so much more into Bitcoin than if I hadn't.

Who cares about fees? I bought Bitcoin on coinbase when Bitcoin was $1800 and I paid about $50 in fees for how much I bought....which is WAY better than paying $1000/per coin on local bitcoins. WAY better. Sure it wasn't anonymous, but I secured more bitcoin than I would have otherwise. Plus, I'm not trying to avoid taxes and end up in jail for some bullshit. It's not worth it at all.

Life's a bitch, no one can deny that. Death doesn't resolve your issues my friend. Overcoming your issues/circumstances is the biggest FU you can give people or the universe. Ironically today on my way in I was in deep thought thinking how lucky I was to be born where I was. I wish I could help every single person who wasn't as fortunate. Good things really do come to those who do good. I've seen karma work first hand, on multiple occasions. Whatever you are going through, try to use it to motivate you to overcome it. Hit me up if you ever want to talk.

1) if LN is used, problem solved.
2) who the fuck is gonna sit there for 6 confirmations for a cup of coffee? I live in the real world, not your made up one. People would send the payment, their software could easily accept zero conf until they have LN up and running without fail. But it seems like from other posts they will be doing something more on their end. Enjoy your alternative universe you live in where confirmations are an issue. Maybe if it was bcash. Lol

I may need it. Up until this point I only hodl and buy the dip. Lol. Chances are if it goes up to $7k I'm buying back in. If I do, I'll never sell again. That's how I lose all my money. Hodl and buy the dip is great for people like me. I'm string at hodling, I'm the polar opposite at trading.

@_date: 2018-05-07 13:11:08
Bitcoin is financial freedom. Freedom from inflation. You're making the right decision. Heres the best thing you can do, spread your buys out across price points. It drops to $8k, buy some, it drops to $7k buy some, and so on. Eventually you will catch the bottom and you will be winning all the way up. Look at the people who bought at $1200 in 2013...the smart ones waited. Sure back then it probably felt like a lost cause, but we do have some history to go on. I haven't even touched on the technology or how LN is already easy to us or it's finite amount. Im still super bullish, even if we go to $4k.
@_date: 2018-05-06 02:32:13

They have no clue what I’ve done with it once it’s off the exchange. I don’t agree with most of your post, the government is not aware of how much I’ve made on an exchange...unless I’ve given my information to them. Unfortunately it’s the new trend to do KYC. Sure they want to track it, but they can never get it like they took gold. Who is to say I didn’t lose my private keys and I no longer have access to it?
Edit: Also, who is stopping me from sending it from bitcoin to litecoin to ether back to bitcoin? Good luck tracking that...especially when atomic swaps are the new way to exchange. Get rekt government.

You're cute to think Bitcoin needs "stable coins" to be money. That's the fucking money we are trying to replace. Lol. Bitcoin was created because of inflation and at what ease it is for governments to print more month. Tether needs to die for Bitcoin to actually become what we want it to be. Bring it on now sooner than later. I can't wait to see tether die. I don't care how long it takes Bitcoin to come back around after that....I still prefer my money to be MY money. Not the governments playground.

For a decentralized ledger to have a blacklist, it just makes no sense. Clearly there must be some central authority managing this. I did research last year for a bit and I've never found out what companies use to understand if their coins are tainted. Is it their own internal blacklist?

Lol selling at $10k? hell no. I first bought in at $1800…thats not nearly enough to retire on for me. Plus, I won't even have to cash out when it's at $10-$20k, should be more widley adopted by then. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:13:27
Hardware wallet. I use ledger. After trezor wasn't prepared for BCH, dont use them. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 15:35:25
Yup. When I first bought in May I realized quickly there is no good time to buy. Just buy. If you bought high, just wait, it will go higher eventually. I understand now all the seasoned Bitcoin hodler jokes when it dips. Ain't no thang
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:13:29
Ugh bittrex really needs to let me transfer this shit in. Have a feeling I'm going to miss my free BTC. And it's trading much higher than the rest on bittrex 
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:30:49
kind of new to crypto....no i get it. fuck me i lost alot of btc value today. hoping it comes back down to earth soon or I might have to buy more to make up for my loss in btc value. fuck the fiat value. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 00:46:00
Haha love this
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:04:06
I'm not sure, but if I would have kept my shit on bittrex (like a fool would) I would have most certainly dumped at $1300. Unfortunately I played it safe with all my BTC and I can't even get this shitcoin BCH into bittrex. I want to take a hot steaming dump so hard right now. I doubt I will even be able to capitalize on a single sat though...is anyone even mining this shit? Lol
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:47:25

I can only assume the people who think Bitcoin is a scam are the people who haven't taken to time to read up on what the technology is about and/or have the farthest thing from a technology sound mind. In these early days it's the people who already have, or can gain, the ability to understand this technology that will come out on top. I honestly feel like there is no sway down from where we are at now. I hope I'm not wrong. I just can't see a scenario where Bitcoin actually fails. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:08:43
Am I wrong to think that 2x would breakup the bch backers? Would this almost be a good thing for it to fork? Both would just fail.

Who knows....I didn't expect to wake up and see it even close to $800. Still can't transfer in. Part of this feels like it's on purpose as to why bittrex hasn't allowed us to transfer in yet.

@_date: 2017-08-03 19:04:54
I'm not understanding what is being done here, are you saying you sold your BTC for fiat? and then bought back the BTC somewhere where BTC was cheaper? This is new to me, could someone explain it with a bit more detail?
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:52:17
I just consider them all to be fucking swines. It didn't have to be this way, nor would I even frown upon what happened or what they are doing, but it's clear they can't be civil and it's clear they have to resort to these tactics to get their failed tech to reign supreme. It's just laughable how bad it is and how it's not even being supported really. Their website is a fucking joke as well. Lol
@_date: 2017-08-06 17:57:18
It's the word "millionaire" that is bother me here. Lol. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 05:03:45
Real simple, in places like Venezuela 2 types of people have guns, the police, and criminals. What he meant by thus was that if you're government has full control over you, you have much bigger issues at hand. Ironically people in Venezuela are extremely interested in BTC. I guess it's ironic compared to what he said, but I don't find it ironic, it makes total sense when your countries currency isn't worth shit. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:10:09
No really,he forks
@_date: 2017-08-02 03:24:09
True. But I would the option to sell. Especially if it gets fucking dumped hard. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:45:00
Lol fine. I have such a small amount on the exchange. Is what it is. Every exchange is susceptible to phishing, which is why I use hardware wallets.
Also, how are they spreading it to another account if they are unable to withdraw my funds? Do you mean sell to themselves into another coin? I can't even understand how that works. Seriously interested. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:59:32
Like what is the fucking point from these guys from the other sub? Are they that fucking bored? I don't get it, you got your shit, it's ass and everyone knows it, just go away. Holy fuck people have no life. Lol. I personally can't wait for it to be dead so it's not even a discussion. NM fuck that, I hope it stays where it is at so they don't infect this sub again.

@_date: 2017-08-04 03:26:19
I understand trezor is for long term, so is my ledger, but clearly the ledger was ready to handle this split day one and trezor was not. I was simply just pointing out my experience with what has been reported about trezor. If I owned a trezor, I would not be using it anymore after what those owners just wen through. The ledger team is clearly more competent and I could not be happier with my purchase. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 05:54:37
Lol they can pay you for your service while hitting it from the back.
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:10:42
after trezor not being ready for bch....why would you want one? My ledger was ready the day of and everything was simple and easy to use. Split my shit right away and now its off to bittrex. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:08:37
I'm glad I got a ledger. That looks like a toy. Also didn't I just see they can be hacked now?
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:05:32

@_date: 2017-08-18 16:38:02
I love it. And it's the size of a flash drive. Plus the split went off without a hitch. Trezor has dealt with flaws and they fucked up the last split, which lead to not as much free BTC!

Nah sorry, Nick name was ducky in high School, it stuck. Yea and i have the ledger wallet,they have 3 attempts to open it before it resets. And yes I meant a safe at my place and somewhere else. With the amount this all could be worth down the road, I want to be as redundant and safe as possible. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 17:25:29
Bought one. This is brilliant. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 04:47:04
I bought more when it hit $4k and then it kept dropping. Wish I would have bought more around $3700. FML. Still very happy! Always buy! Never sell! To the moooonnn

@_date: 2019-11-18 13:44:40
Lmaoooo that was great.
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:39:49
Trezor fucked up the split and can be hacked. Have yet to see anything bad in the ledger camp. That split went flawlessly and I was able to move my bch right away to avoid replay attacks. Ledger is worth 3x what it costs imo
@_date: 2017-08-06 21:59:00
Let alone that you are a "millionaire" from it. I just thought it was funny because anyone who is real about bitcoin doesn't view it in shit fiat.
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:08:11
I have the ledger nano, IMO it's a must have if you invest. Just buy one and stop being so anal and worrying if it's worth it. Take your crypto off of all exchanges. Want to lose all your coins? Keep them on exchanges, that's how you lose your coins. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 05:07:35
Not related to the article really, but I feel like it's only a matter of time until the United States government trys to kill crypto and all exchanges. They know it means the end for their organized criminal Enterprise between them and banks. Just more of a reason to take your shit off exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:38:28
Yea but I also am using Google authenticator 2fa to make any withdrawals. All they can do is login and make sales for me. Which is why I don't keep very much on an exchange. I don't trust the United States government and I fear hacking. Hardware wallet for the win. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:19:53
It's analogous to tcp/ip, it's as simple as that. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:56:06
True, but dont a majority of us also agree on the concept that once we reach the moon we wont have to convert to fiat?

lol thats nuts. glad you got your money back. wow. There are good people in this world. I would give it back as well. $500 isn't enough to feel like shit over. Now if it was like $100k, maybe you would get half back ;)

@_date: 2017-08-02 16:46:14
My friends read an article about Bitcoin and the word "China" was in the article.... That have 200% been validated that Bitcoin is ran by the Chinese and they "wouldn't dare" get involved. Then they shit talk it. Who is laughing now with all my freebie bch I'm going to dump first chance I get. God it feels good to be so right. Lol I love the old heads to... "you should be buying gold" �������� fuck am I going to do with that? Can gold fit in my USB sized ledger wallet? 
@_date: 2017-08-26 11:57:03
Yes they are all fucking wrong. I'm not heading over to r/btc making tons of comments about how their website is basically  a wix template, or how they have shit code, or how they are clearly trying to attack core in the most childish and I'll mannered tactics. It's a fucking joke and their ego needs to be taken down a couple notches. I honestly can't wait for it to fail, I'm tired of reading this bullshit and I'm tired of seeing the all out attack on bitcoin. They are so fucking blinded by trying to make their failed tech win that they can't even see what they are doing is just causing so much harm to the communities and to crypto currency itself. If the goal is to kill bitcoin all together, they are doing it the right way and it's sad. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 04:59:24
Ok so I have this wallet and I'm not sure what I should do. Do I need to move all my BTC from my "BTC" wallet to this segwit chain now? If I don't, am I at risk at all? I'm a bit confused about segwit. What happens if I send my BTC from bittrix to my ledger wallet? Do I need to send it to the legacy BTC and then to the segwit one?
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:50:44
I'm dumping all my Alts now. Sucks if it's a bad decision but I don't want to end up with less BTC as the last hike to $4k really fucked with my portfolio. I guess that's what we say if it isn't Bitcoin it's a shit coin. Why do I not learn?
@_date: 2017-08-02 02:49:25

Right now, coinbase has fucked my business up. We sent $5k to coinbase pro, coinbase fucking doubled the withdrawal so we had the bank cancel the one $5k withdrawal and the other one still went through. On the coinbase end, the $5k deposit has been removed and I have an email telling me my bank cancelled the transaction, which they did....but it was only one of the two $5k transactions. Needless to say coinbase has $5k of my money now and no support infrastructure in place to help me out....emails only and it's been nothing after two days. Fuck coinbase. This is fucking awful and they need to be sued to all hell this lack of support is unbelievable. And now I don't have the transaction details from coinbase because they removed it from my account. We are fucked.

Don't listen to this guy, eth is a shitcoin. We know what we are talking about. Eth was down for 4 days last year because of fucking crypto kitties, it's complete shit. Also wallets are always being hacked because it's a nightmare to Dev for. Litecoin we don't mind, it's bitcoins testnet and it's been proven to be pretty resilient. I only own Bitcoin and litecoin. Even then it's 95% Bitcoin in my portfolio. Eth will pump, especially since the United States wants to pump it, good luck getting out when it falls ETH falls apart though.

I miss people like you on this sub. I kind of embrace a major correction to get back to the basics of hodl and buy the dip. It’s a simple concept and anyone who has looked at bitcoins history can see that if they adopted this, it’s always worked. I’m in this game until I can use my bitcoin daily for everything. The idea is to use it, not cash it out.

Does anyone know if BCH will be able to be traded on Kraken? I just signed up for Kraken. Also, I can send my BCH to my "split" account in my ledger wallet, should I send there first and then an exchange?

@_date: 2018-06-27 13:51:21
100% agree. I'll go one step further though, a majority of people can't come up with $400 in an instant, so the reality for most is that $1k Bitcoin became out of reach. This is why Bitcoin is so sacred to me. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 01:00:30
I agree. It's both bad and good advice. Only time will tell. If someone is on the fence and they want to buy and hodl, it's always a good time to buy. I don't give a fuck if you bought at $18k.

Even though my building is full of engineers...they all most are trying to tell me to buy gold, not BTC. I'm like, what the fuck am I going to buy with gold? How long does it take me to send gold to a friend overseas? How quickly can I turn gold into shit fiat USD?

10 S9 ant miners? Have you not seen them on mega sale? Have you not heard about the new Innosilicon Asics? Anyway, I'll give you the advice someone gave me here over a year ago...just buy it. I also mine with a group of guys but I put all my personal money into Bitcoin itself. Our mining operation is less than 1/4 of what I have and I've spent alot less. Don't mine, buy.

Well, for me it's a store of value since I bought early enough, oh and the fact no one can take it from me. Buy today, buy yesterday, buy tomorrow, eventually you will be green in terms of USD. that being said, I'm here to stack sats and don't give a fuck about USD. Its deflationary by design.

Ok, how am I supposed  to take cash out of the bank if there is no electricity or internet? How do they know how much is in my account? They dont. And idk about you but i dont know many people who hoard cash in their house, and in the instance of PR chances are you lost the cash you did have at home with the house itself. I dont care what that article says....if I have $50k in my house, it's way too much money to carry around as cash. Vs a bitcoin brain wallet and I've lost absolutely nothing.

I need to buy some more because at this point, I'm just gambling that it will go lower to buy more. I always know DCA is the best and I try....but I have a lump some I want to spread some buys out with from $5k - $2k if we do go that low. God I hope we do....I will have so much more Bitcoin.

My friends tell me I'm a gambler and that I got lucky. Bitch, knowledge is power. I've given them all the knowledge and tools and they still can't understand my simple ass explanations about inflation, the gov/fed, and the bullshit the banks do. These same people don't trust the government, but then with money they just blindly follow. It makes no sense. I've tried to help and I gave up. So I just "lucky" after watching ever single video on Andres Antonopolous YT back in early 2017. I was buying like a fied after intro to Bitcoin. The tech is cool sure, but I'm here for thT hard money. ₿uy ₿itcoin.

@_date: 2018-06-28 00:33:43
This statement and logic is flawed for me. For someone who's main goal is to own as much Bitcoin as possible "taking profits" isn't possible. That means nothing to me. Why would I exchange my beautiful censorship resistant finite Bitcoin for a shitcoin like Fiat? The ONLY exception I would take is if it was used to obtain more Bitcoin, then this makes sense to me.

I see what you are saying, but I disagree. All of them are centrally planned and funded, Bitcoin is not. Therefore making the comparison you are making doesn't really make sense. The United States can jail vitalik, or any other creator of a coin, that cannot be said for Bitcoin. These Alts are all scams or 100% worthless. I can't wait for this spread of Alts to die like the ones in the past. Good luck with your shitcoins. 
@_date: 2019-08-21 18:01:06
I believe you can still make transactions offline. Not sure how risky it is. I'd also argue any place that doesn't have internet/sms, either is the exact place that needs this money to survive, or is a place that doesn't care. The banking system heavily relies on the internet as well outside of cash money.

Fuck you talking about PR like it was better to have cash? Chances are any kind of cash or fiat is gone. Chances are their entire bank is gone. Idk about you but I would have grabbed my crypto steal and left...in fact, I'd argue fiat is just as worthless, if not more worthless without electricity or internet. If all my funds are stored online, how the fuck am I going to use them? At least with bitcoin it's in my hands. It's kind of dumb to even compare any currency in a scenario like that...money means nothing at that point. It's what can I barter or give you a service for.

To this date $1200-$9k (when I first told my friends until now), they still don't understand the meaning of what Bitcoin can do for you. It's a very clear and easy thought, they choose not to accept it.

@_date: 2018-06-19 04:27:10
It's fucking awful. I opened a business account and I wanted to buy some shit. I put money into my account and then tried to buy shit...they wouldn't let me. Called them....blah blah blah it's fraud protection. They were actually holding my money hostage. Then weeks later I transferred some more money...took over two weeks to fucking clear and get into my account. Paypal is absolute shit for mid to larger sums of money. I absolutely hate them. I use them out of necessity. If I could buy/sell all the shit I have in Bitcoin, I wouldn't blink twice. I try to but it's not always the fastest way to get rid of shit. (clearly it's the quickest way to settle)

I disagree with this comment. I feel much more safe owning my own money. If you're responsible and have done your research, I'd argue this is much more safe to own Bitcoin than fiat in a bank.

@_date: 2018-06-23 02:41:38
Which is why I'm planning to buy a certain amount at $5k, AND start buying using dollar cost average again. I put my dollar cost average buys on hold because it was so obvious we were going lower. I will do the same if it ever touches $1300. All I know is...I want as much Bitcoin as I can. I said this may 2017 when I got in, and after opening my eyes to our financial system...I want an exit from Fiat 
@_date: 2018-06-18 19:28:09

For me, it's these attributes as to why I love it:
- Censorship resistant, Gov can ban it and I can still use it.
- I can destroy my wallet and as long as I remember 24 words I have my money.
- Store of value.
- Government cannot control it, inflate it, or take it from me.

When I see this I just stop reading. It's lazy and provides zero intelligent conversation. I don't believe any of it...just like that whole "we are dumping because of a mt goz trustee bullshit". Seriously people, start to use your head.  Markets are fucking wonky, crypto. We have no regulation.

No need to apologize! Omg yea as I was reading that I was shocked how calm you seemed while writing this (thinking it was 32 BTC). Still, currently 0.32 BTC is alot. So sorry for your loss man. I really hope you're able to make up for it.
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:26:14

Ok yea, ALL people are so stupid that they are gonna sell for tether and then buy Bitcoin. Thata the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Why would I want to pay trading fees 2 times? They would just dump their alts for BTC. The ones dumping alts for tether or USD....no one cares about them.
@_date: 2018-06-06 17:09:54
Lol ouch. I am knowledgable on Bitcoin (how it works, I don't know shit about trading) but I won't claim to know something I don't. I'm just fed up with everyone on tiwtter and other places who act like they know something about something they clearly don't.

I'm not sure what your comment is actually pointing at since it's half an idea. But if you are hinting that libra will be good for 3rd world counties, lol. What will libra do that bitcoin already can't? Libra will 100% be more censored and 100% can be blocked by any gov or fb themselves. The same cannot be said for bitcoin. Go ahead and ban it, you can't. nor can you stop it....so IF i am trying to think like a person in a 3rd world country, I want the money that no one can take from me. I assume people in 3rd world countries are familiar with what gov's can do with your fucking money....your comment assumes they dont lol. I'd love to hear more about your thought because it makes no sense.

You're spending $7k on something you're not gonna do some kind of research? I fee like any kind of research would have led you to the conclusion it wouldn't have been worth it. A fool and his money WILL part ways. Wow. You're dumb.

True, look at bcash and what a shit show that is. Lol. It only strengthens my agrument. Bcash users are like "are 5 blocks being mined today, or are 500 blocks?". My God man. Core is taking it slow, this is their full time job, and clearly everyone who says this shit hasn't the slightest clue how hard development is. Everything has bugs...and it's money. Imagine a bug that allows for you to lose all your money, you sure would be blasting them for not finding it and taking their time during development. I doubt they are taking their good old time. Development isn't fast, and when you have everyone's money at stake I can only imagine how much more scrupulous you need to be. I am reading through the Mastering Bitcoin book right now and i have a firm appreciation for what they do. It's complex, it's massive, and a single mistake could bring the entire system to a halt. But yea hey....let get this shit out as fast as possible. Lol I won't respond anymore to your posts on this. It's beyond stupid. 
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:33:59
jesus. ah, so bitcoin can't do this? all while not being monitored or censored? did you even read your comment before clicking submit? there is absolutely NO reason to own libra. you just mentioned ALL the best attributes about bitcoin while having NONE of the bullshit that comes with libra (large corps, censorship, etc).
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:05:07
I can't speak for the rest, but for myself im fine with this public shaming...I don't want them to be a part of this community. What makes people think these cancerous individuals would change once they become part of the community again? Flush them out. Let them create their own shitcoin. I'm glad 2x is dead but I also kind of wish it would have happened so those people would just have their own coin that they wanted. Kind of like the Bcash crew. Ironically I've grown a respect for the Bcash people through all of this, not all of them, but the ones that were against this as well. At least for bcash I can say they are trying to become THE Bitcoin by not having to flat out attack Bitcoin but by trying to be better. This is good. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:19:24
I don't doubt it can't happen, but the people stating it will because it has in the past are nuts this is a whole new ball game. I'd be beyond shocked if there was a 90% correction based on new traffic alone. Too many people out there willing to buy the dip at the sniff of a 50% dip. Sure I could get rekt, but I've gotten rekt before and I'm just fine. Hodl and buy the dip! It would hurt like crazy but if it dipped to even $2500 I'd seriously throw the rest of my savings at it. I don't care how dumb it is. I believe in the community and the developers, and most importantly the technology. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:03:54
OP title is misleading...says they will not support it if there is no request. I'm not sure who or what this request needs to come from (a group of miners I would assume?), But seeing as this request has not been made so close to the split is good. I will not day 2x is dead until it's dead....let's hope this signaling is utter bullshit. I actually would love for the Bcash people to stick to bcash, I would start to gain a tiny bit of respect to them instead of switching to 2x or the hot new thing trying to take down the honey badger. Those types of people I have zero respect for, but the straight up bcash supporters, maybe I need to start respecting them if they honestly feel bcash is Bitcoin (obviously it's not, but I would be open to not blasting them because this would mean said person doesn't have it out to do everything possible to take out core). 
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:45:03

@_date: 2017-11-14 19:39:22
Bcash has been more profitable before and miners have not switched. Now with the DAA normalized if be shocked to see then switch for minimal profits. Anyway...you're argument is invalid considering they are mining bcash because it's more profitable...do you really think these miners would gamble with their earnings by keeping it in bcash? It's just a means to an end for more Bitcoin. Lol. Good luck with your flippening. I'll never support that's shitcoin. If Bitcoin goes to zero and bcash is the major player in out. But it will never happen. Wall street isn't concerned with bcash...and the mass adopters who aren't technically sound only know of Bitcoin. Bitcoin cash will be irrelevant lksk the rest, and I won't rest until it is. Bcash is a shitcoin. Lol @ the new fork and the dev fees as well implemented. Total shitcoin.

Honestly, even though Bitcoin gold seems rushed and a joke, it's the best out of all of them. At least it's not revolving around a corporation or alternate motive and most importantly wanting to kill core. You want to fork Bitcoin, all power to ya, that's what Bitcoin is about....but the 2x camp doesn't want to fork, they want to fork and kill the current chain without consensus. Which is why we consider it an attack. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:10:23
The harder they fall then. Maybe the 2x failure has revived bcash. It won't last, they claim bcash is Satoshis original view....however they are centralized. Like who made the decision to change the EDA? Even the Bcash crew was like wtf, who decided this?
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:23:56
ETH is a shitcoin as well and it's  in market cap. Why are you so butt hurt about a comment about your alt shitcoin? It's clear that the only coin to hodl is Bitcoin. Hodling any other alt coin would have resulted in less gains unless you got in before a major bump. You must be new to this sub. If it isn't Bitcoin it's a shitcoin, the only slightly exception would be LTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:43:39
Very true. It would take an exchange to do this, and others would have to follow. I can't wait for this. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:09:10
Uh huh. Sure. I could see a 50% correction from $10k, but to think there would be a 70% - 90% drop is delusional. Was wall street trading it last time? Was it as easy to buy last time? Was it all over the news last time? The answer is no. Good luck never buying more if your saving for that shit. 
@_date: 2019-10-14 15:25:06
Well that's on them. How come other companies nwere able to do so? Overstock, newegg. I buy my VPN using Bitcoin every year and it works without any issue.

Hey guy, im not a mind reader. How is someone supposed to deduce that you were speaking towards the argument that someone who was afraid of using Bitcoin? Why don't you say what you mean then. Where was this "argument" even coming from? You're head? It's like you're having a conversation with me in your head. My comment would only be intentionally obtuse if I actually knew you were speaking towards that, which I didn't because now I'm back to being a mind reader. Even then I'd argue that you're wrong. Lol. Jesus you guys are so fucking smug.

I'll admit, I kind of want to take a loan out and buy more during the dip. But I'm talking like $10 - $20k...an amount that would take me like a year to pay off. Taking our large loans in the $100k+ range is a sure fire way to become homeless...or at least poor with no savings or money.

I feel like Bitcoin is different. Sure there could be a massive sell off on CME, but I honestly don't feel like it will change the price as much as everyone thinks. Unlike stocks we are buying this supply directly and hodling. There are a TON of us just waiting for a sniff of a crash.

Have you factored in paying gains on the sell? If it's short term I think it's more than 20%. That being said you do have more Bitcoin so probably worth it in the end.

you linked the 2x nodes...
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:42:33
You’re a fool if you think segwit hasn’t been implemented by these exchanges for non-political reasons. For shits sake coinbase sent me an email about 2x the other day because they were still thinking about implementing it. Segwit will be implemented soon as it should. Anyway, as a software engineer myself, I’m very fine with slow development and proper testing when new features want/need to be implemented. 2x is a prime example of this. Software development takes a long time and these aren’t Android apps being made and these developers know it. Everyone’s just so now now now now these days. I really wish 2x wouldn’t not have been abandoned and we would have dealt with that one off block freeze for the whole world to see. It’s a reminder that it take a major effort for this programmable money to be 100% bug free. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:09:52

Wtf, I paid for this book. Well it's the 2nd edition I have at least. I agree, too many people only see price and have absolutely no clue how Bitcoin works. So many posts about "where is my Bitcoin" and they can't even think to look that the mempool is being spammed. I check the mempool before I transfer always....I wouldn't know this without rasing that book
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:43:21
This post makes me cringe. I hope core can implement new features to prevent such attacks that are going on. I'm fine if it was a real fork without the bullshit shenanigans going on, but that is not at all what's going on. If it was just a regular responsible fork and it took all the PoW, then yes it would become Bitcoin I would think. Again, that's not at all the case. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:54:06

This terminology needs to end. It's not legacy if it is Bitcoin. 2x isn't an upgrade of Bitcoin it's a fork, and a fork not coming from the community but corporations.

You're response only being financial tells me all I need to know about shitcoins. I don't care about them not because of their price or returns. Man this is why alts are in trouble, people treating them like stocks now and only news drives them. I've never called them shitcoins for their price or returns...they are shitcoins because of their technology and lack of good developers. Plus the added fact that literally NONE of them are being used for their supposed real world use cases. Ergo, shitcoins.

True, although I think it will happen way before inflation sets in

Lol came here to qoute the same thing. My God these people exist. If he would have listened to this sub however....he would have hedl and been fine. I too panic bought to begin after reading this sub in the begining...however I didn't take every word in this sub for financial advice. I looked at the Bitcoin chart and realized, ok, anyone who doesn't sell never loses. Sure it could all go to shit ( although that looks very doubtful) but the hodl and buy the dip method has worked for me since I started in May and I've made more than my entire 401k in 6 months. In fact I'm thousands over it now. Hodl and buy the dip! It's not hard!

It is. I myself have skipped the programming related chapter because I'm not able to sit down with it at the moment. When I do have time I will. For me learning how the cryptography works is the hardest to grab. It's not a book you just blow through, you have to do some research when you come across something you don't understand. Let me tell you though....it is rewarding considering the vast amount of pseudo intellectuals out there in Bitcoin who actually think they know this shit and try to teach others. I try to correct everyone I can. I probably come off as a douche because I'm not nice about it....but it's usually because they are so sure of themselves. I had some guy block me on Twitter because he didn't understand the simple concept that the nodes validate the blocks and that's their major purpose. Without them it's not decentralized. Lol ironically most of them are bcash supporters and I'm not surprised. We can be better. Knowledge is power.

Yea, but was wall street entering the market back then? Was there much buzz back then? Was there this much volume back then? Was segwit activated back then? Was LN just around the corner back then? I think it's crazy to think it would go sub $3k even...although it would be rough I surely would embrace it and buy as much as possible. Honestly, just to think it's going to repeat just because it happened before is a really dumb. I aggree, there will be a steep correction, but I can't see it falling that far at all. There is way too much hype and way too much new money coming in. This is completely different that those last hikes. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:26:13
It's basically around the price where the 2x futures were. I'm not shocked at this at all. I will however be shocked if it went and stayed in the $2k - $3k range for any extended period of time. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:35:37


Last I checked larger blocks isn't scaling. Sure that's more trhougput but that does nothing for scaling. Also, I love how people just act like there aren't plans for scaling. Lol ok sure bcash has larger blocks, I'd love to see those 8 devs they have implement real scaling features. Not gonna happen. For fucks sake man, everyone has this NOW NOW NOW mentality. Look at ETH, it's a complete shit show and I can't believe the price hasnt plummeted. Hack after hack after hack. This is programmable money not an iPhone app. Could you imagine a dev fucking up and someone with real money lost millions and millions of dollars and that person is a bad person? Lives could be at stake. Jesus Christ people, Bitcoin will be scaled. This whole argument makes my head spin and no one even wants to admit that larger blocks isn't scaling. Simple comp sci.

I think bcash is a shitcoin, but hey if they too think 2x is a shitcoin, I think we should embrace that. I'm fine with coexisting with bcash, it was never a threat, and never will be. It's the Bcash supporters who were anti-segwit so they could hate core who are now pro 2x as well that can go fuck themselves because it's clear they want to make the world burn.

Your most likely comparing two different type of people making these comments. I'm waiting for a further dip. Idk about you guys but I'm not selling based on fucking taxes alone...or I would have sold at $7500 to buy the dip. Not a day trader and I never will be. Hodl and buy the dip. It's simple.

OP is dumb. Getting rich is coupled with more adoption...we all knew this. Shit the fuck up and stop complaing about it. Do you not see the market cap go up?

This attack will only make the core developers more aware and I'm hearing this attack isn't even new. I'm sure down the road an attempt to spoof nodes and take down the network will be dealt with. You want to fork? Go ahead and for? No issues. You want to fork and take down Bitcoin....we have issues. How about you 2x fucks make a BIP and implement it into Bitcoin the right way...that's how you upgrade Bitcoin. Calling 2x and upgrade should result in losing all bitcoins, or at minimum massively being ridiculed.

Although a crazy drop would hurt....at least I could aquire more and more. I bcash looks to be on a roll, all the 2x crew went there I bet. Let's be glad they are all out and have their own coin. I was hoping 2x would allow for more to be flushed out of Bitcoin. A fall to 2500 will hurt but God damn I'm ready for it and I'm buying a ton of it ever gets that low. I'd be shocked to be honest. I bet we go down to $5k and hover around there for a bit. Only time will tell and I have no fucking clue.

Ah, no they don't. That's just signalling. I'd  be shocked if it's even close to that come fork time. Anyway say they do get 80%....so what, we have 100 min block times instead of 10 minutes. Who cares. It wouldn't last. Also, all the nodes they have are on AWS, I'd hardly call that support. If anything that tells you to run for the hills away from 2x because it's most likely a company doing that. As for the echange support....they are calling it 2x not bitcoin, good luck with that. Stop being easily swayed by all the bullshit shananagans they are doing to fool you. You sound like you've been in alt coin world too much believing all this fud.

No they don't. We don't have a fees problem, we have a spam transactions problem. I'm not even convinced all these blocks would even be this filled without those spam transactions. Who are all these people moving their coins so often? I never move my shit. Plus, 90% of the volume is from exchanges.
Also your argument about fees is 100% invalidated with 25cent segwit transactions. What do you think will happen when those 8mb blocks are filled all the way as well? You would have resolved NOTHING. Fees would be high as well. Bigger blocks literally does nothing. Let's here another one...I'll knock it down as well. Seriously guys, does anyone think? Or do they just not know enough about bitcoin and how it works?

Ok so say you upgraded your network to 100gbit and so did everyone else, now everyone has fast throughput and starts streaming more. Now more and more customers start to do the same thing, has throughput fixed your system as the amount of users scale? No, the underlying network infrastructure would need to be upgraded to scale. I’m too tired but maybe i will link info on it tomorrow. I’ve also heard eric lombrozo talk about this recently.

@_date: 2017-11-09 17:15:50
Who the hell are these people moving Bitcoin all the time? Traders maybe? I'd have to assume that's a small fraction of people compared to hodlers...I could be wrong. But I honestly I'm never moving my bitcoins unless I buy and move to a wallet. Oh no it's a couple dollars to move! My life is over! Meanwhile if I pull out USD from an ATM other than my banks I pay a crazy fee for even $20 to be taken out.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:51:30
I don't use it for micro transactions and I'm not sure why anyone would at the moment. I would actually use another currencies for that atm like you do and I'm fine with this for now. Luckily bitcoin is programmable money so I have faith in the core developers that some day this could be fixed for micro transactions. Also look at using a segwit address as this does help with the fees. I have also sent Bitcoin before using 12 cents in total for the fee and it's gone through. That however I would not do with a large amount of Bitcoin. But for me to send say $50k of Bitcoin to someone right now would cost let's say $30 to do. Now try to do that using any other form of currency on Thai Earth like USD to euros, or even sending this amount to someone you know. It will be taxed to shit and a huge headache. Someone would gladly pay $30 to do the transfer via BTC instead. Zero overhead, reliable payment transfer, and you can view the transaction data. Ever since Bitcoin I've grown an visceral hatred for banks. Lol

@_date: 2017-11-02 20:18:07
I would advise against it. But if they is your best option for now I would say stick to it...depending on you level of knowledge on how everything works. Coinbase emailed me and they said that everyone will have 1:1 of Bitcoin and 2x, so you might be safe. I'm just not sure what will happen if they seriously change the name of 2x to Bitcoin and Bitcoin to something like "Bitcoin Classic".

Either you’re not aware of the shenanigans going on or choosing not to ack it. There are public talks about cutting out core using all tactics they can, including Sybil attack (spelling?). I’m not going to talk like I know what that is but I’m aware they can spoof nodes using this tactic and that isn’t consensus to me. Is consensus a bunch of AWS nodes popping up? I see that only 300 of the 1400 nodes are AWS. Quit acting like it’s just a fork and if it becomes majority it’s ducking bitcoin. That logic is wack and you know it. So Burger King can just call themselves McDonald’s I guess sir they end up with the most volume. This makes no sense. This is NOT a consensus fork at all. No issues with bgold since they aren’t trying to deceive people into killing the current chain of bitcoin. You want to fork, go ahead and fork, but if it’s not done by consensus of bitcoin it’s an alt coin. Plain and simple. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:52:05
For sure. But again, in its current state it's a store of value. You can send with custom fees and I've sent shit before with 12 cents in fees. Took a while to transfer but it went throw. Again, this is what LN is supposed to fix. This whole need it now shit needs to go. My God everyone is so impatient. This is programmable money... Not the latest fucking iPhone app. Even then apple pushes down broken updates all the fucking time. My God imagine if that happened with your money. It's remarkable how much people dont understand development and how it should work. My old manager was a fucking history major and somehow worked his way into a project manager role and this guy would give me the most unrealistic timelines. Like a fucking cyborg couldn't code fast enough for this guy's deadlines. Everyone is all butt hurt about the fees but no one wants to put the brain power into thinking why...could it be a result of exponential growth? Were the fees always this high? What do you think the fees on litecoin or shitcoin cash would look like if they had as much volume? They haven't fixed shit.

Seriously? Look at all the alts going up. They all are...which makes bcash an alt. They can try but no one is fooled. I also would like to let the weak hands know that the more you fold and sell to bcash...we thank you for the coins. OP is right about only the small time ivesters and the hodlers getting boned because it won't last. Look at fork.lol. bcash has been more profitable to mine and hardly anyone cares. The amount of miners that switch is minimal. Bcash is an alt and it's clear the market thinks it is as well as it's going up with all the alts. Watch it doom and gloom when we go on another major bull run. Also watch the weak hands fold to bcash while we plummet in price and then lose all their money switching back to Bitcoin when they realize it wasn't real. Just like that idiot on YouTube who took our a loan and lost a ton by switching over because he reacted like the rest of the weak hands. Id love a dip down to $5k again once we hit our ATH, all gobble that shit up.

Do your research, there is a ton planned with Bitcoin. It's programmable money, and just because it wasn't implemented before doesn't mean it can't be added. Even smart contracts is planned. Also if you aren't keen on the innovation in Bitcoin...you must not be following it closely. Watch the scaling Bitcoin conference on YT that was a couple weeks ago. The brains behind the developers if Bitcoin is a level I wish I could be on.

If we already weren't bullish on Bitcoin...imagine a world where there are multiple top companies for Asics and no one wants a shitmain miner because they don't want to be associated with it. If dragonmint didn't have their minimum 5 miners per purchase I'd buy 3 of them. I hate that I had to buy 3 miners from bitmain but it is what it is. I'll never use their pool. As soon as I get them I'm using slush.

I wonder if that 1.6mb block out the nail in the coffin.

Lol maybe we are in for some free air drops for a very long time. Hey I'm down. I would love to dump 2x at its current price. What a great holiday gift, free BTC.

I like to reply with "are you going to tell me how much is your savings then?". I either get a laugh and "i dont have any savings", or a "oh ok,  well that makes sense then".

I'm preparing myself for 100 minute blocks. It very well could be for a couple months....and I think that is worst case scenario. I would expect that after the for when everyone realizes nothing has really changed, the price will shoot right back up and it will be everything as normal. I think since some will Minch bcash, and others will mine 2x, this makes it a great opportunity for people to mine Bitcoin. I also have 3 S9s coming late November so I'm hoping that is the case. ��

I'm kind of ready to be back in an office environment. Probably not right away, but eventually I will be able to leave work again and come home and the work day is over. I'm currently a software engineer for Intel and they fired my whole floor in the begining of 2016 but kept me working from home. I'm leaving because they are consolidating again and "offered" me a job in San Diego and if I didn't go I was losing my job. I started looking for a job that day and that was like 5 weeks ago. So that's why I'm leaving, but its probably for the better as I will be making more at my new place and I scored a job as a software dev in the health industry. They are going to train me and I'm hoping to make a career out of it. Working from home is a dream when it comes to the freedom, my manager didn't care when I worked as long as my work was done. I'm going to miss that but it did get to the point where I didn't enjoy my nights and weekends as much because you are always in your work environment at home. For me it's hard to stop working when I needed to. What was your reason for leaving working from home?

Lol ok. He got lucky for hodling Bitcoin. No, he was smart and realized that 99% of these alts will be dead. I bet if OP would have invested that amount into Bitcoin only he would have had more. Although I won't know because idk when OP bought these shitcoins. Idk why anyone would hold these shitcoins right now anyway. I cant believe the amount of people who are fine by getting slaughtered. I cut ties with all my alts right before this bull rush thank god....and I'll never go back. In b4 all the "it's never good to invest in only one coin" idiots. That's not what history tells me.

When people ask how much I have I usually ask them if they are going to tell me how much they have in their savings and entire portfolio, because to me that's what they are asking me. Then they get pissy when I won't tell them. Lol what's funny is even just 4 months ago I might have answered them. Not only has the price gone up to the point where i shouldn't tell anyone anymore, if it gets to a certain amount I might just tell everyone I sold (obviously I never fucking will, because in buying my Lambo in Bitcoin!).

But unlike gold we have other exchanges who will buy up the supply. Unlike gold the entire supply could be bought up as well and we would know about it. I don't see futures really doing much to it. And if it does crash the price, I'm sure there are plenty out there like me that would love this to buy more. The lower the price the more I will buy for. I'm like a crack addict for Bitcoin. There are millions like me.

Because there are so many people that don't understand Technology. My one buddy doesn't even know how to turn on a computer. That's fine, people use phones now. But they rely on what other say. He was about to buy some Bitcoin back in early 2017 when I talked to him about it, instead he read an article on how "China owns Bitcoin", and immediately flipped to thinking it's shit. It's funny because he and I blast the media for how bad it is in politics and sports.....but yet he trusts what he reads about money. So fucking wild and he cannot understand it when I explain that to him. Now he is forever against if because of one article. People lack the ability to think for themselves, and those people will get rekt. If something ever did come out that was better than Bitcoin, was actually decentralized, and bitcoins took a shit (not in price but in decentralization, all the good shit), I would certainly be open to that. You gotta be able to rationalize and put bias aside sometimes. That being said, I don't think there will ever be anything to replace Bitcoin lmao. We are way past that and everything is a money grab after Bitcoin.

Search the sub. In not going to do your homework. They link and they are publicly speaking about killing off the current chain using tactics like I have spoke about.


How the hell not? They are actively winding up nodes to make it look legit, actively talking about it how to spoof core nodes for 2x, actively talking about having bcash steal mining power from Bitcoin (ironically bcash EDA changes nov 13th, shocker) and change the PoW to 2x. It's not an attempt to upgrade, it's and attempt to control. I'm done after this comment because you clearly are choosing not to understand what I am saying and it's going in fucking circles.  Blah blah blah opportunity for other blah blah upgrade. You are speaking the 2x bullet points I bet if I check your profile I will find why this is all making sense and you are choosing to act like 2x is something it's CLEARLY not. If it walks liek a duck, and talks like a duck, it's a fucking duck.

Lol I missed where I personally attacked you. Let me tell you this...I've been there done that. Everyone shouts fud at things they don't like to hear. I dabbled in alts and I'm lucky I didn't lose. These alt communities are just filled with cheerleaders and YouTube videos about people saying &lt;fill in alt here&gt; will take over Bitcoin or eth, or you name it. When in reality 99% of these shitcoins will be dead eventually. So when you come in to this sub trying to be cute and mention to tip someone in a shitcoin, lol yea I'm gonna call you out on it. Of I didn't sell my alts before this last bull run, I would not be sleeping as well as I am. I'll never buy another alt again and it's clear why.

I really would love China to come out and be pro-bcash only. I bet the market would react good at first for bcash...but it would be awful for them in terms of decentralization.

Idk about you but I know a fuck ton of you out there who if they saw $3k - $4k Bitcoin are grabbing as much as they can like me. Sure $4k could be a 50% drop from an ATH of $8k, and yes that would suck, but to think it would do a 75%+ correction...it would take 2 things, a successful 2x 51% attack, or the United States government banning Bitcoin. And so far only the 2x attack is even plausible as the United States looks more and more likely to embrace it (for now).

How dumb are you people? Seriously? First of all I've sent payments for pennies. Second of all, let's look at the gas stations and the fees they pay to credit card companies. Do you honestly think they wouldn't jump at the chance to ONLY accept Bitcoin and offer their gas at an affordable price? Everywhere I see Bitcoin accepted they offer discounts. It's all relative and you retards are just believing the bullshit your fed. Go learn about Bitcoin and learn about how you don't need to pay crazy fees. My God I'm sick of having to defend this shit. Either people are dumb or a paid shill. Muh feeeeesss. Lol GTFO.

Gos sure, but every chance I can I use Bitcoin and just replace it. The hodl mentality is meant for not cashing out/selling, not to never use it for purchases. If you hate Bitcoin so much why are you even here? What's the point. It sounds to me like you hate it more than you like it. What a waste of time this was. Why am I still even typing?

The government considers all cash payments as money laundering basically. Bitcoin can be transacted just like cash, even can be lost like cash. Bitcoin will be illegal and called a terrorist and criminal act just like they will say cash is and ban both cash and Bitcoin. I'll probably get downvotes for this but its the truth and it wouldn't stop me at all from buying Bitcoin. I would buy more.

@_date: 2017-11-18 16:10:27
Yes, this is the type of thinking I'm talking about. Maybe not have it a set amount but more like but some way to aggregate the fees miners are willing to accept and create some minimum number of sat/byte the transaction would have to be, else it would not enter the mempool. I understand this kind of territory is dangerous when it comes to the freedom Bitcoin provides...and the fact that something like this could potentially give miners too much power. Things would need to be ironed out for sure to cover all use cases. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:58:37

I beg to differ. Look at how much everyone was buying it up even for bgold. Forks are great for Bitcoin and horrible for these shitcoin alts. 2018 will be the year of the forks, bring it on, who isn't loving this free air dropped money? Of course it's a dad like ICOs were, it won't last. But I don't think it divides the community, the people who are pro bgold are mostly if not all pro Bitcoin. It's the Bcash/2x community that is anti-bitcoin and I'm totally fine with them be divided from us. Goos riddence. I haven't met a 2x fan boi yet who actually understands what they are doing and that miners aren't the consensus. Most of them will tell you the miners are consensus...that's not Bitcoin, that's a shitcoin mentality and logic.

This is the largest community experiment I'm even aware of and I don't even want to imagine what a "game breaking" bug looks like. Chill out. Have a beer.

Having a bad day?
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:29:12
It was faster and cheaper for one reason...the amount of people using those chains pales in comparison to users on the Bitcoin chain. Bitcoin isn't a currency at the moment and the sooner you come to terms with that the better. I think one day it will be ready for consumerism maybe, but not now. Right now bitcoin is a store of value, like digital gold. Nothing more and nothing less. Try to buy some gold and it takes all this effort and you will be screaming just to pay some small fees like we do in Bitcoin. Sure there are fees...but outside of trading idk why people would be shifting it around all the time. Since I've bought in this past may, I've literally only moved my coins from an exchange and to a hardware wallet. Tried some trading and I sucked so I quit and the funds are back in my wallet. Also going a t shirt on open bazzar and it took 3 days for the Bitcoin to go through because the mempool was spammed just like it is now. Who cares, this whole 'needs to be fast and cheap' mentality needs to go away, that's not what it is right now. I'd also like to point out that when bcash dropped it took some people a week to get their funds into an exchange. Bitcoin has only slowed down because of the shit algorithms bcash uses for their EDA and the miners switch there ever like 3 days to exploit it and make more money and I don't blame them.

Wtf guys. I bought at $6k and sold it right away because I thought we were going to $5k. Lol. I'm a hodler so it's gotten to the point where I just laugh about it.  This is why you never sell....even the smallest of purchases.

I know people can transact via satalite, what about running a full node? We might need that soon. Also, if we lose net neutrality, I think that might actually speed up a decentralized wireless internet. Ive seen demos done already using raspberry pi's.

I'm also part of hodl gang, but I will most definitely be selling around those prices, with my sole intention to buy more. Sure I don't know where the top is, but the moment I feel euphoria again, I'm selling some. I have a set amount I will never sell.
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:02:18
Probably damn good. Wait for that pump to die down from Korea, and the difficulty to adjust. This is clearly an artificial pump and was planned, I only wish I didn't sell mine so fast. No body respected btrash before, nothing and changed.

I've said some pretty wild shit and attacked the shills pretty hard...I'm still here. So I question, what gets you banned? Im sure it's shilling an alt. Guess what, if it's not Bitcoin it's an alt...no matter what fantasy world you live in and you think some other alt is THE Bitcoin. There is one Bitcoin and it gets upgraded through BIPs.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:10:58
I completely missed where he implied bcash...or why youre even bringing it up. Sure the underlying netowork is "the same" but the developers are not....and let's not forget about who is pulling the strings on new implementations. Quick acting like they are the same, they are not. Do they even have a GitHub? I should know this but I don't.

Last time I checked core was still implementing features for scaling. An example would be lightning netowork. Bigger blocks was no solution to scaling. People are too impatient and I believe that's why these dumbass forks happen. They have every right to fork, fork away, but we all know 2x wasn't just another fork. For shits sake let's be patient and let the devs do what they are trying to do. Look at what a shit show ETH is....and people want scaling NOW NOW NOW. my God people, do you want to lose all your hard earned BTC from a missed bug? After all it's programmable money, not a fucking iPhone app

Yea it sucks spending money on it vs buying more btc but you can never be to safe and hoensly if you even owned $100 in Bitcoin I'd say buy it. I look at every amount I own as if it's already worth a $1mil. Lol. That's how high I hold it and that forces me to be as safe as possible.
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:30:31
Lol ok. Largest atm manufacturer is pushing down am update to buy BTC, wallstreet is starting to trade it, LN is on the horizon and almost all tests passed on test net, and like 10 other things and here you are thinking the price will just fall to that amount because it's happened in the past. Ok guy. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:36:12
I highly doubt this. I'm sure I'm not the only one that would take out of those savings for $3k BTC. My God I could get so much more. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:57:06
You're a retard. Not that I don't think we need taxes, but Bitcoin is the reason why we are all anti-banks and anti-pointless taxes. Taxing my money at an absurd amount...fuck that.

@_date: 2017-11-10 20:30:50
I just visited It's like they already are claiming victory because Bitcoin is falling. Lol this is called a healthy pull back and I'm ready to buy the dip. I love how they act like 2x not happening wasn't a clear victory for Bitcoin and the Bitcoin community. Lol for shits sake i couldn't feel better about this. As a community we successfully voiced our opinions and 2x was canceled ������ how dumb are people to think that news would NOT be bullish for Bitcoin in the long term. Anyway, enjoy the pull back guys, I'm waiting for ~$5k Bitcoin and I'm buying as much as possible. If it goes lower, I'll have more then. I love this sale while the sheeple are buying up bcash. Alsmot feel bad for their simple minds. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:53:53

To be honest, I'd save shit fiat to buy something like this. Bitcoin is still in it's WAAAAYYY infancy for me to want to justify taking any out to buy something like this. Sure I use BTC to buy things all the time on open bazzar and other places, but I always replace it.

This is why I can't see a crash to $1k. We have wall street coming in and soooo much more volume and it's growing exponentially. It will dip to around $5k and with all this new volum, I'd be shocked if we went below $5k. Sure it totally could  but I also remember when people were saying how the bounce back from $3k was a dead cat bounce....this while sub was saying it and they were wrong. Shit I could be wrong. It's all speculation. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:59:27
i didnt see a /s and im not a fucking mind reader...so yea i can't understand what you are thinking. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:52:02
God, even the new comers are being brain washed that scaling isn't happening and it's a major issue. Wtf this who scaling shit is remarkable. We need to link videos to scaling Bitcoin 2016 &amp; 2017 in a post and sticky it. These posts are retarded and I'm already tired of seeing them. It's beyond me why a noob would be concerned about scaling when there are probably a million other things they need to be worrying about like security of their own Bitcoin. Gtfo OP 
Edit: if you spent time reading and not just posting about you "concern" about scaling, you would know that the mempool is being spammed constantly while miners flock to bch to mine it for a major pay day. Don't blame the miners one bit, bit the crazy swings in hash power should be done. Look at the mempool when it's not being spammed....there is no issues at all. In fact, I'd say 95% of transfers are from exchanges. Any retard could make the conclusion that you literally cannot say Bitcoin can't handle the load....it can...we just have bad actors spamming the mempool. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:09:38
I agree, but look at bcash, there have been times it's been more profitable and they don't switch to it. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:58:19
Honestly, and Im sure I'll get blamed for this, this doesn't really align with this community....this type of action aligns with the bullshit I've been seeing from the 2x crew. In a day where I can't trust anything anyone says, I need to see proof before I believe the guy had to jump on Twitter to say he was against 2x. Plus, if someone is making death threats to me to publicly pull out of 2x...why on Earth would you mention the death threats forced you to do so? I would think that would provoke them even more. All I can do is speculate because I can trust anything I read or see without proof. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:03:47
Lol ok. Idk how many times people will just choose to not look at how block size increase is a throughout increase and nothing to do with scaling. Literally it will do jack fucking shit to raise it to 8mb. I’d love to see the Bcash network with our volume but it will never happen because it’s a joke and a clear sign that the devs aren’t CS centric for bcash. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:49:59

well i think that u/tbdgraeth was being sarcastic, you're 100% right. I can't believe the amount of people who said bitcoin is going up because of libra. I don't know many people in crypto who even want to touch that shit. I also can't imagine anyone who isn't in crypto wanting to use that shit....just use paypal, or cash app, or venmo, or zell, fuck there is so many today. I have no issues sending money to people these days if I need to digitally (do not take this as me saying i like it, i fucking hate it, i wish i was dealing in bitcoin instead, just proving a point here that libra is obsolete).
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:04:58
Hodl my friend. Buy the dip all the way down. This is how you make gains. I bought more at $7300, and I'm buying more at $5500…and again at $5000…and again at well you get it. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:14:03
WAY more profitable. 2.8x more
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:07:17
Well I for one would love to see the what the network would looked like without the mempool being spammed. Idk about you but if I took out some Bitcoin from a well known ATM manufacturer...you will see it in your wallet immediately. I'd move on with my day know it will get there. But yea, I assume LN could help with this because usually you take out money from an ATM to use it right away. However I could make the argument that people only use these atms for buying it just to buy it. If my local gas station had one I know for sure I would be buying from there. I'd love to support the cause there. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:23:04
It's not justified. I'm just saying I'll believe it when I see it. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:16:47
Depends on how much you have. I'd say anything over $500 is worth an investment for a hardware wallet like the ledger nano s. I don't think it's not safe, but at the same time I read all too often on here about people getting hacked or losing their coins. I'd be depressed forever if I lost my shit... especially with the optimism everyone has about Bitcoin and where it can go. I actually think I might move mine to cold storage but with all these damn forks that's almost not even an option if I want more free BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:58:57
I call it faith. I have faith in the core devs, the community, and bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:52:31

@_date: 2017-11-12 21:25:15
Sure, but it's not accurate. I read all the time on this sub about people selling to prevent loss and it goes up out of no where. This doesn't apply here. If you are at a "loss"...just wait and eventually it will go higher. Pandora's box has been opened with Bitcoin and shitcoin cash is not a threat. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:22:13
Yea but they were already trying to make laws on it. I remember reading ealrier this year they wanted to pass a bill where if you came into this country you had to claim how much you had. Lol they clearly still don't understand it.

Fuck mark. I won’t forget how he started. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:29:43
Lol nice try...that's not a fix whatsoever. Seriously...this whole block size argument just makes people look straight up dumb. No critical thought goes into it. Ok so say we increase the block size per say, we still have those spam transactions and as mass adoption goes up we are right back to square one with full blocks and spam transactions clogging the pool. So what do we do then? People would say the same thing...increase the block size more. It's not a fix...not in the slightest. It's a short term solution and i dont even feel comfortable calling it a solution at all...even in the short term. This is why I love the developers of Bitcoin so much, they are engineers with years of experience and they know damn well that a block size increase is only a very short term throughput solution and not scaling whatsoever. I don't expect many people who aren't in the comp sci or related fields to understand....unless they have done their own research. Then and only then will they come to this conclusion...else they just say "block size increase".

I'm torn on that topic. While stacking sats is the number one goal and 1 Bitcoin will always be 1 Bitcoin ...I have to stick to the dollar value until things change. Is what it is. Sure, id love to go around talking about everything in denominations of Bitcoin, but no one would know what the fuck I'm talking about. It actually makes me a bit hard thinking about talking how much dinner will cost in sats and it's normal.
@_date: 2019-12-04 19:05:42
Because the mining hash power didnt go parabolic and just crashed since the last halveneing right? Mining will, and has, kick off an efficiency race. If you can mine without paying for electricity,  you're winning. We will see a shift towards being self sustaining and eco friendly,  that's how people will make the most btc. You're thought process is way too narrow and only at current price.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:20:42
Lol you want me to source my personal friends? I didn't say they were going all in but while thier currency is worth less every minute (quite literally) it's a preferred type of payment or way to transfer money. 
I don't understand you, you act like I'm just making shit up then you give an example of a place where there is hyper inflation. So it's clear you understand that Bitcoin is a way better form of currency for these places with hyper inflation. Venezuela is fucked, like majorly.

This is exactly why everyone needs to read Andreas Antonopoulos book called mastering Bitcoin. I'll shred anything my dad says simply because I've read half of the book. I need the time to finish it. I haven't read Internet of Money yet by him but I assume that's more of an economic side to why it's so good. You're dad just doesn't know enough about it to form an opinion but yet he does. These old heads tend to listen to the same institutions that have been sucking them dry for years. We are different and this is the age of information and digital currency... knowledge is power. I know what is on the horizon for Bitcoin and it's almost will not to want it. Sure a steep correction could be coming...but that doesn't take anything a way from the technology and how pwoerful it is. The world may not be ready...but it will look back and in the blink of an eye people will be like "how did I not see this coming?"
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:13:29
It's a pump, clearly. And I don't blame the miners for switching. They aren't switching to mine BCH and hodl it that's for sure....I have 3 S9 coming late November and I would switch to bch as well as a means to acquire more BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:07:30
Lol but that doesn't fit their agenda 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:07:57
I think what you want simply cannot be done in Bitcoin. You are wanting faster micro transactions I assume, because as is idk how it isn't fluid. I've never had a transaction not go through. Compare it to the banking system and it's fluid as can be. We have blocks every 10 minutes, that's how Bitcoin is structured and if we tighten that time frame we have inflation, an example is bcash with their retarded EDA. I think it's actually acceptable for businesses to accept 0 confirmations in a transaction (which is almost instant once added to the mempool), especially for smaller purchases. Larger purchases I could understand needed 6 confirmations. Even then, large purchases are done in minutes vs all the headaches with the banking system. Honestly, I'm fine with Bitcoin in its current condition and the technology will get there. It's like living in the 90s and email is just starting to be used....there is so much we have yet to accomplish.

@_date: 2017-11-18 23:41:24
For sure. And I 100% agree. Other smaller wallets and exchanges have segwit implemented and that's my argument for these larger escahnges who were part of the NYA not having it implemented. Surely they wouldn't have done it because they were preparing for Segwit 2x. One would think then if they were prepared for that...they should have segwit implement soon as well. For shit sake they can even come out and say they implemented segwit and the fees they used to have to charge have been slashed. It would be a win win for them. But I have no faith in companies like coinbase to ever make the correct decision.  They can't even offer support properly.

I believe Coinbase pro is much cheaper on buys. I do the same with gemini since I refuse to use Coinbase. You pay so much more for their cleaner, non trading buying. Idk what to call it sorry. On Gemini "pro" I can buy without the USD in my gemini account. Although there are no stops I can place if I was to sell/buy. Coinbase pro doesnt let you buy without the USD in your wallet.

I heard someone say this back in June. It's actually better to be entering the market now that people are realizing what it is worth. Could you imagine if this goes to even $100k?

Lol let the weak hands fall. Either that or you have invested more than you are willing to lose. Why didn't you sell at $7500? I think the entire world knew we were going to pull back after 2x. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:10:26
Depends on if we are saying personal gains or Bitcoin gains. Which is what I was getting at in my comment. My gains are different than yours if you just bought in 3 days ago and me 6 months ago. Which is why it has to be bitcoins gains.

I highly doubt there would be another 4 years like that. Too many more eyes on it and it's it's all over the news.

Thanks to this sub for being the bright light in this space.

How about you stfu. Your post makes it seem like them doing the right thing now makes it ok for all the wasted time and effort....oh and let's not forget how toxic this whole event has been. People getting death threats, swatted, manipulation. I love Peter Todd for his clear concise logic. Don't let the foot off the gas and we have to deal with less and less of this bullshit. I assume the 2x crew is looking to take their time and get more organized for some other sort of attack.

So consensus then is trying to trick the original chain nodes to kill off said chain. Get the fuck out of here. You know damn well what is going on and what is trying to be accomplished. I wouldn't feel so strongly about 2x if they weren't actively seeking ways to lie cheat and steal to push their company coin and kill off Bitcoin isntead of letting the market decide. Again, either youre dumb as bricks or biased. I tend to think it's the 2nd one. I'd agree with everything you are saying if the 2x camp wasn't scheming to kill of the current chain. Honestly, if they do, I'm fucking out and I dont want to be a part of this shit. I believe in concensus and what they are doing is not that. You fucking know it. Shit even they know it.

@_date: 2018-03-31 03:49:45
I would not worry about fees. It's clear your unable to buy the dip because you are worried about fees. Last year, if I would have waited to buy after my money was in there, it was like me buying at $2500 instead of $1800. Paying the fees was always worth it. Even today I would do the same. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:22:17

Yup. For me, I don't care what price it's at. I'm buying. I live the idea of it being my own money. Sure I have the luxury of buying at $1800, but I've been buying ever since last may regardless of price. Hodl, and buy the dip. This is one long dip imo and I'm very very glad for it. This has allowed me to aquire so much more. Idk about you, but the price dropping is exciting for me. After last fall, I thought I'd never have the amount I do now.

Outdated tech? Are you just chosing to ignore reality? Are you completely unaware of LN and all the other layers being built around Bitcoin? It's a literal internet of money being built, it's ever changing, it's programmable money....it will never be outdated. Lol. I'm sorry but you lose all my respect with just one line. Don't give a fuck about it as a currency, it will always be one to me, it's the store of value and the fact no one can take it from me. It's MY money, and no one else's. Sure I'm crazy enough to keep doing it, but most of my buys have been around $2k, so I'm fine doing it again. I have this luxury, I understand not everyone does. I only invest what I'm willing to lose. I'm willing to lose alot to help build hard money. Humanity needs this.

@_date: 2018-03-31 04:03:38
So people were saying to sell for weeks, just as people now are calling the bottom in. Sorry, they don't know shit and I don't keep my coins on an exchange because I'm not an idiot. Sure I should have "took profits" but for someone like me, I'm not in this for more USD, so the term taking profits doesn't really apply for me. I want to keep it until I can use it, not cash it to shit fiat. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 16:30:16

If you call blind Faith hour upon hours of research into learning what Bitcoin is and what the economics of it mean, sure blind Faith. I hate these fuck Boys. I'm in Bitcoin for the simple fact it's my money. I will continue to buy it because even if only one person is mining it, it will still work.

Ah yea. I'd mine at a loss just to mine Bitcoin. Why? Because I like it. I'm not talking about a massive mining farm here. If it all went to shit and no one mined, yes I would still do it on a $35 raspberry pi. Just because I'm a geek and I love learning how things work. I also learn new programming languages for free. I've even created things for my local gym and don't it for free. This is how I learn, this is how I get better.

Youre underestimating the United States government. It will fail. It's used to circumvents taxes and laws...they don't like that. Idk why people even want to use that hot trash. You can't even extract it to real USD. Have fun playing with fire. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:57:12
Don't regret it. If you're like me, you have a life and a full time job. I didn't know that was the top and i joined this experiment for the long hual. Sure I wish I could have sold some, but I do not regret it for one simple reason, I still own the same amount of BTC. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 23:04:26

As deep as it takes to get me to my goal amount of bitcoins. Idk about y'all, but at $4k I'm throwing my first large chunk, then if it goes to $2k, I have an even larger chunk ready. Some think we are going to test $1300, I don't want to time it, I want to be sure I have some so $2k for me is where I go bat shit crazy and buy as much as I can. I'm not afriad one bit.

@_date: 2018-03-07 04:01:07
Yes. Yes I would. It's why I'm still buying. I'm not scared. Maybe I'm just brain dead, but I sure enjoy knowing it's my money and 8m in control. If it fell to $100...I couldn't see it staying there forever. Likely we will even see $4k again. Shit at $4k I'm wiping my savings for it. There are alot out there just like me who are super hungry for it. Sure the tech is cool and what's on the horizon is amazing, but I just love being my own bank so damn much. For the first time in centuries, we have our own money. Now that's power you don't want to just pass up on.

Just like they didn't shut down BTC-E. Lol. People who are on the tether boat are just 100% irrational. I don't get it. Just the concept of it throws off a ton of red flags in my brain. 


They haven't tried. Tether is centralized, aka not censorship resistant. Which means they will shut it down in an instant if they want to.

Welcome to Are you an internet maximalist? Good luck with your shit coins. Not a single one is even close to any real world use case.

I bought more at $4300 from coinbase, hoping to get more if we go sub $4k. Don't want to see it to that, but I wouldn't hate being able to buy more with the same amount of USD. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:08:32
I bought on the way down in the $4k range...pissed I didn't save some for that $3k dip. But I'm still super happy with what I have!
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:26:14
Except in your scenario this implies I have time to watch the market and have a magic 8ball. I have a full time job, my main goal is to obtain as much BTC as I can. I can't do that if I sell expecting it to go lower and it ends up going higher. I read so many posts of people doing this last year, I will not be one of them. Hodl and buy the dip, that's what I follow and it's worked great for me. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:20:52
I stopped reading your post after the first paragraph, yes the United States will shutdown any exhange they want. Have you not heard of them doing so to BTC-E? They will do whatever the fuck they want. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:20:59
Yup. I know there are plenty out there crazy and hungry just like us. I'm right there with you man!

If this was me I wouldn't be taking any money out but using it all to buy Bitcoin. I'll figure out a way to use it. I don't need a bank to store my money anymore. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 19:56:49
This is so fucking wrong. I don't have time to sit watch the market. Sure I could have sold at any point up until now (from the high) and it would have been the right decision, but I have a full time job and I don't have time to learn how to read charts (not like they even help). So for me hodling is the only way I don't lose my precious BTC. Hodl and buy the dip. For fucks sake this anti-hodl movement is retarded. I just assume it's people who aren't serious about Bitcoin, and/or are bcashers. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:39:53
Always. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 02:12:50
I started in May. I bought some at $2500 And if dropped to $1800, so I bought more. Lol. We will be fine. If we stay at $4k the rest of this year,  everyone would consider it a bear market, but I would be more than happy and it will eventually break our previous all time high. Everyone in this thread always preaches how we are in the super infancy period still. I agree. And when it hits $10k eventually we will be laughing at how we were scared about it dropping from $4600 - $4000. Let's also not forget how we blew past All of $3k like it was nothing. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:35:23

This is the stupidest article I've ever fucking read and I am now dumber for reading it. The auther talks about how she bought Bitcoin back in Jan, but then says "well that's not true" and proceeds to say she bought eth and ripple. So the title has NOTHING to do with Bitcoin but about her impulse buys of two shitcoins and she's down a fuck ton from her stupid ass buys. My god, I want to be a journalist. It takes zero effort and you can be a complete retard. Clearly the title of the article is to bait you, and this asshole even says "I bought Bitcoin....no it wasn't, it was eth and ripple". This is the shit that triggers me. Fuck this lady. Enjoy my downvote.

Sure, I hodl as well. I make sure that I never lose the amount of BTC I own. If I buy something in Bitcoin, I buy it back using fiat. I'm not in a minority here, I'm sure plenty of people would use it frequently if they could. I wish I actually could use it more. Have you been here long? I've had conversations with plenty of people on this sub on using Bitcoin over USD. It's easier and I'd say more preferable. I agree using my fucking credit/debit card. It's also made me more aware of how much money I'm spending instead of using credit. In fact, I'm finally close to being debt free AND owning Bitcoin, in fucking wining all over the place son.

Lol it's people like you who I would love out of Bitcoin. You have no understanding of its real value in the world nor do you care to even try to open your mind to it. Your comment about the public being stupid and putting their money into a savings account is on track with our logic....if you meant it was dumb to keep it there. I would think anyone in finance would love to get away from the government as much as they can and avoid taxes as much as you can right? Does that not appeal to you? I for one love Bitcoin because it's mine to keep, unlike any other fiat system, unless it's cash in your hands, it's not yours.

To get back to your point, business owners are willing to take the risk on selling a service or product that isn't worth thousands of dollars or more.

Why would I lose my BTC? Obviously you would split it first. Anyway, this isn't like the BCH split, I take back what I said....I think it would be best to hold it until things sort themselves out. I'm fine losing air dropped crypto...but I'm not fine losing everything if for some very very odd reason 2x wins out. I need to be smart and sometimes I get ahead of myself. Be smart.

I think it's a mistake to say this. This isn't why it got so popular. It got popular to begin with because of it being our money and not the banks. Anyone in Bitcoin who isn't in it for that reason, is either gonna flake out or already has.

@_date: 2018-02-09 13:38:01
Not from where I'm standing. Keep cherry picking your stats. You're like that guy who said "told ya" when he said not to buy in the hundreds when Bitcoin went in the thousands. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:39:08
I bought a t-shirt from this guy and all I can do is say how good his support is. Looks like it's time to buy another shirt now. I don't know much about btcpay but ill look into donating there as well. Congrats!
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:04:09
100% agreed. This is why I hodl and buy the dip. All those noobs who laughed at me for not selling back in Jan (and they were right in hindsight) don't know jack shit. This thing will wreck people in an instant. Sure I should have sold some close to the high, but who is to say it didn't go higher? I made my mind up and I'm not selling shit until 2020. Hopefully by then I don't have to sell and just use it, as it is intended. This is what I signed up for. This is what I want. I do not way to ever send it to cash, that defeats the propose of it.

@_date: 2018-02-25 19:37:44
Maybe I wasn't clear enough. Do you honestly think these nation's will implement a decentralized blockchain? I don't. Therefore their "Blockchain" is just a linked list ledger. A database. 
As for your Satoshi comment, I don't even know how to answer that because it makes no sense to me. I don't even know why you would say a statement like that and include his name. 
Of course I only care about Bitcoin, and this is the sub no? So why are you here trying to lecture me that other cryptos are in existence? I don't give a fuck about other Blockchains, to me they are all scam coins that have yet to be used in their real world use case. Not a single one is. Go somewhere else if you want to talk about alts, I could give a shit. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:51:10
So say I sell right, and I sell right now. I go to bed and I wake up and I go to work. Then I come home and I have 4 to 5 hours before bed....are you literally going to sit there and tell me my "whole post is false" when I have 4 fucking hours a day to buy/sell. You don't know me, you don't know what I do for a job, and your ONLY looking at your use case. So please oh please inform me how to sell and buy back in. Do you have a magic 8ball? You must, because clearly you know when to buy and sell. Everyone was saying $7500 was the bottom just yesterday and two days ago....it wasn't. So who's post is false? Jesus Christ so man people with zero fucking brains. The price being down helps me a ton, I'm excited, I can afford WAY more now that I could even a month ago....I'm only triggered at the retards like you in this sub who can't see past their own keyboard.

My entire argument: Random people who see it and don't know the art will form a negative opinion of Bitcoin based on the way it looks. 
It could be Van Gogh and it still wouldn't make a difference.
You're arguing about something different than I am dude. All I did was mention how I viewed it, do you think I'm the only one? I'm done with this conversation.

Lol it's hilarious to me that a government would actually crack down on this like it's some illegal form of activity. I can see the United States trying to do this as well. Same reason why i believe weed is illegal...too much money is to be bad if it's illegal. It would obviously be in the untied states best interest to ban it (in their eyes not mine)

You're in luck! Lightning network is rolling out as we speak and the fees are SO cheap you wouldn't even notice them. In some instances you even have negative fees!! No joke. People claiming the fees are too high (not you) are just false. There were posts on this sub about people getting transfers through for 1 sat/byte, which is next to nothing. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 03:06:23
No...you are. All that fud and horrible news in days this month...and the price has been resilient. So yes, people who have a brain and can understand how more and more resilient Bitcoin is becoming to news are bullish on Bitcoin.

I missed where I even hinted that I think it will go up bevause it has in the past. You just judge me for a comment with very little info. It will continue ur upward due to buzz, more market cap, more features being baked in that is planned, decwntalixed echcnages will come to, atomic swaps will become the norm...that's why it will continue to rise. People like you scare me because you just make judgement calls about some random you don't know on the internet. Id buy with ONLY Bitcoin if I could. Just last week I've stopped using Amazon when I could and use overstock because I can buy using Bitcoin. Idiot.

Ok, so how do you obtain Bitcoin or tether without using fiat first? In your description as to why tether was good, it completely circumvents the United States government....if you honestly think they will stand for that your playing yourself. No exchange is exempt from being shutdown by the U.S. Government. You can't own tether without owning Bitcoin first and how do you buy Bitcoin?...with fiat. Anyone who plays around with tether is just plane retarded. Good luck and won't feel bad the moment people lose all their money when it's shut down.

Here's the best advice you can get, use dollar cost average. My sister wanted in at $16k per bitocin and I told her to be responsible and go in at different levels for amounts you can part with. Luckily she listened and she now has money to buy at much lower prices. She's in the red and she's excited as hell because now she can afford more! Buy at different levels with only a percentage of the allotments you've given yourself. ONLY buy what you are willing to lose. Of course people didn't do then which is why it's been selling off. Don't fomo, be responsible and you will be able to hodl. I've seen people on this sub trade all their money away because they bought in for too much and kept trading with emotions. Good luck. Pm me with any questions you may have, I can answer them all!!
@_date: 2017-09-26 03:19:02
I care about what people think about Bitcoin. I spread the word as much as I can. I spark up convos all the time about it's benefits and it creates interest.

except you dont know anything about me and sure I could have sold, but hindsight is 100% and you have got to be kidding for acting like you new what was going to happen happened. I work full time, if I sell what on earth makes you think I could get in for a lower amount in time? If I sold at 19k, who's to say it couldn't have fallen to 17k and then back up past 21k before I can even get to buy. I'm not freaking out on people who have a fucking brain, this sub is littered with retards lately and almost NONE of them either have commented in this sub before or are new accounts. 
There is only ONE sure fire way to never lose bitcoin, and thats to hodl, this is why I hodl. Fuck the USD value, im not in this to make more shitcoins known as USD, im in this to aquire more bitcoin plane and simple. And people like you are the retards who have gotten so far away from this.
Hodl, and buy the dip, its that easy.

I spent a week learning about bitcoin while my bank account got cleared on coinbase. That whole week all i did was watch videos from andreas antonopolous. Thats all i needed to know as a computer scientist and libertarian....and i was hooked. I still am hooked. Did you know where the top was? I didnt. and if you say you did, youre full of shit. Sure i could have sold at $15k, $17k, even $9k and buy back in for more, but the reality of it is, i have a day job and i do not have the luxury to sit and time the market. I also have no clue how to chart things. What I do know is the fundamentals of bitcoin, how it works, and the slew of innovation in the pipeline or rolling out currently. So yea, my net worth has plummeted, but if you look at where I bought, um, no, I'm still super ok with this AND I ONLY WANT MORE. 
HODL AND BUY THE DIP!!! THIS STILL APPLIES TODAY AS IT DID IN 2017 AND YEARS BEFORE.

@_date: 2018-02-01 13:46:14
Haha same for me, but at 12k. Oh well! I have more Bitcoin than I did before the buy! Buying all the way down is usually what's best.

@_date: 2018-03-31 03:37:41
God I would absolutely fucking love this. SURE it would hurt, but I could easily buy SO much more. People have been wanting it to go that low to buy....but they won't. EF that, in super excited for it. I will hit my goal amount of BTC if this happens. 
Also, if we do, we are in one MASSIVE hyper wave and $1mill/Bitcoin really wouldn't be out of the question.

What happens when someone losses their private keys? So sends to the wrong address and that 2.7 billion dollar shipment is lost forever? Lol sure the security might be better, but I feel like this is an awful idea. That's like putting medical data on the Blockchain, the simple fact that someone could lsoe the private keys and it be lost forever in my mind is a deal breaker. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 13:49:18
1) can be exploited.
2) it gives the rich more money. People who own alot of eth make way more eth. Fucking awful idea.

Kind of like declaring Russian collusion before no evidence is presented eh. CNN been selling that shit hard as fuck while looking to be completely convicted there was something there when there wasn't. It's always guilty until proven innocent with them, which is why they don't hesitate to write the false narritve to begin with. So yes, anything to do with Russia collusion is 100% fake to me. In a world where HRC is walking free for having our top secret and confidential emails just out there for people to grab....I don't trust a fucking thing man. The government is the biggest racket I know of.

I'll be getting the f in
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:12:57
Nope. The whole point of bitcoin is demolish the corrupt banks who have complete control of YOUR money. In fact, its not even YOUR money. You dont want to pay fees? Use paypal, another centralized bank. We use bitcoin for financial freedom...freedom from the banks. Banking the unbankable. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:37:44
Yes your talking about something different. I'm talking about on the way up last year...over seen Bitcoin shred the largest of sell walls. I'm not talking about shredding them since we've gone bear, that would be stupid. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 23:11:43
What happens when your servers go down and a contract doesn't get executed? Lol no thanks. This is why centralization is cancerous in this industry and I chose to stay as far away from it as possible
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:25:05
If I could, I would much prefer to buy anything in Bitcoin. I will almost always replace what u bought as well to not lose the amount I have. I believe in the technology and I absolutely love the idea that I can buy something and no government will know. For instance I always buy my VPN in Bitcoin. No way to ever track it was me. Especially since I used my cell phone (cell data) and they can take track me via ip for even the purchase. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 03:21:45
Haha fucking nailed it. Some of the plebs in this thread and others I read are amazing 
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:24:48
Lol no one cares. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 16:53:00
Even before the ban it was like only 5% of volume. Sure I want more people buying and I don't doubt the people in China want a fiat exit door, I just meant that everyone has a hard on for China and I don't think it would be much more volume (at least in the short term). 
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:09:28
Which is also very important

@_date: 2017-09-25 16:37:29
Yea I'm sad I didn't have the money to buy that $3k dip. Oh well, I'll be super in the black when we go above $4400 again. Honestly though, I almost done even care about the USD value, Im just concerned with the amount of BTC I own and i could have had more if I waited a bit more for that super dip!
@_date: 2017-09-26 04:43:48
Nah I'd buy with Bitcoin...but then replace it IMMEDIATELY. Lol. I've only had the pleasure of buying my VPN with Bitcoin and some shit off new egg...and immediately wanted that amount back in BTC. I will always choose to use BTC over Fiat.
@_date: 2017-09-24 22:13:57

Let's compare it to NASA. How much time and money was wasted getting to the moon? It doesn't matter considering all the innovation that came as a result. I consider mining Bitcoin to be in the same boat. I think we will end up with more Innovations in electricity then prior. After all, that's how you earn more. Mining Bitcoin incentivizes decentralized electricity. If I'm self sustainable in mining....what does it matter then? I'm using electricity that wouldn't be there otherwise.

Honey badger doesn't give too fucks about your "manipulation". I just consider people who cry manipulation just aren't knowledgable enough on something. It's an easy excuse for them and I have zero respect for anyone claiming manipulation. 
Edit: I started to watch it to give it a chance and I just couldn't. 83 subs, so dude must be new, and he's talking about the 7% and 10% swings....were you not around last year when the very same shit was going on up upward? No one was claiming manipulation back then we're they? This is seriously just cancerous FUD. Downvote the fuck out of this uninformed peice of shit video. I can't stand seeing this shit on this sub. Go away. I hope you sell and get rekt and never come back, I'm honestly tired of seeing this shit.

It's amazing how you guys just chose to not understand what I'm trying to say and just attack me for not knowing the art. I don't know what I don't know....and if I don't know this persons art...I'm going to form an opinion about Bitcoin. Now imagine someone else who doesn't know about this art and already has a somewhat tainted view of Bitcoin...they will think the same thing. If I can think that, so can someone else. You guys just chose to be like "well you don't know the art and that's you're fault" lol that's not the argument and I'm sorry your so.ple minds can't really read and understand my simple argument.

So I'm supposed to just know it's fine art some how even though I don't follow or know any art whatsoever? I can't know what I don't know. You even mention how dumb people don't think, that just proves my point stronger. It just comes down to I don't know art one bit, and I would never know to think to myself...hmm that looks like art maybe I should research it. It's a t-shirt, not a painting.

You're doing it right. Maybe spread it out even more if you can. I bought all the way up, and I'm buying all the way down. I know eventually it will pay off. Dollar cost avg is your friend!!  
@_date: 2017-09-25 21:28:18
Because why not? Fuck TA, Bitcoin does what it wants and the only thing that derailed us was China. Would you be shocked if China came out and was like, ok exchanges are coming back but regulated? I also don't understand why they say Bitcoin exchanges in China are banned...why is bitfinex still up then? That exchange has so much volume.

I should have been more clear. More volume in each block, decreased mempool from a backlog of transactions since more are being pushed through. See below, the block size continually increasing dynamically. 
 
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:00:20
Lol it's so clear to see how twisted they are. They wouldn't implement bcash because they claimed they had it in thier customer best interest....but they are willing to call whatever chain has the hardest difficulty after 48 hours Bitcoin. What a fucking joke. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:47:40
Could this also be why the price of Bitcoin is dropping? A "sell the news event"? I really don't care, just curious. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:28:16
So you support S2X without knowing what Segwit acutally does then. Segwit IS a block size increase. Please read up before you make such wild and dumb decisions. Idk why someone would be proactive Bitcoin and then say corporations play a vital role. Why don't you just say it...you're for a large corporation hostile takeover of Bitcoin. After all that's what you mean.

I am being cocky, because look at ETH  on coinmarketcap since I jumped in to crypto in May. It's price hasnt moved very much but bitcoins price has. Therefore ETH is worth alot less Bitcoin as time goes on. ETH is a shitcoin just as much as the rest of them are. I don't care about their fundamentals because some of them are really good, like NEO. I was able to see that Bitcoin will leave most of these alts in the dust, and this past week was a reminder. This happened before during the last boom a couple months ago and some of those alts still never reached the same in their BTC value. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 06:22:03

What the actual fuck? How does this even work? Say the difficulty changes right and Bitcoin now has a harder difficulty...so it's Bitcoin and then Bitcoin segwit2x are the names. Say then the difficulty switches and the 2x chain has a harder difficulty....are they seriously going to change the names to something like Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin (as in the 2x chain is now Bitcoin). This is a completely retarded statement to make. I'm back to hating these fucking idiots.

Anyone else scared with that they are planning to try to do? On Twitter and they are trying to plan attacks to make the current Bitcoin chain obsolete. I'm not entirely sure how it works yet, but the outcome would be that only one will prevail. Seeing as how much miner suppert there is for 2x, this actually scares me. Not trying to spread fud, I would just like to open a conversation about it because this kind of shit is what actually could kill bitcoin IMO. It's cancerous and fuck all of now. People always say we shouldn't talk down or negative about them...but it's clear to me how they are basically btc terrorists.

This is super exciting. Was watching TOne Cats talking about how if it only went up to $5500 then dipped we could be in trouble. Man I just hope I get paid in time for that dip when it happens. I believe that $5k is our new support right? If that ever does get broken I think would be in bad shape. Looks alot less likely however. I think if it hits $8k and dips to $6k, that will be the last time I'm able to make any big purchase. I'll still buy some bi-weekly when getting paid, but I won't be able to buy large sums of it after that. Lol. Well I guess I still could.

Lol suuurreee....meanwhile on bcash they are mining kb sized blocks when they claim they wanted larger blocks. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:04:35
I've done this before. It's simple, just wait and it will eventually go higher than what you bought in at...always
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:58:46
Years? I mean the price not being lower than it is right now jsut shows how much more resilient it is. If we stay around this price I expect it to sky rocket again the moment we all know 2x isn't happening, which looks more likely than not. I bought alot at $4300. Not even shook at the moment. I too thought it wasn't going sub $4k.
@_date: 2017-09-09 06:58:31
Guess you didn't see the word "student" in the title.

Well I guess I meant college student. I too worked in high school. Any tech degree college student however, that would be tough. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:25:28
Please show me on the chart where if I bought and never sold where I would lose money. It's your stupidity as to why you don't understand how big it will be. Governments will never know how much i have, it's redundant unlike your shit fiat once you lose it it's gone forever, thanks to blockstream money can be sent even if the internet is down across the globe, and I can avoid all government taxes by sending it to anyone world wide. So what makes you think once the general public understands all of this they wouldn't prefer it? 
@_date: 2017-09-30 01:03:13
Today is my b day....if this isn't a sign idk what is. Unfortunately I can't get open bazzar to work on my shit because my ports won't open. I need to spend some time to figure out how I can get them opening my modem because port fordwarding isn't working on my router.

Gold per ounce...I can cherry pick numbers as well. Called you a financial guy because I can see where you frequent. Not sure where you are getting this 9 billion number from but the market cap of Bitcoin is above 80 billion right now.

But it's still possible...
I've done this multiple times with sending shit that's not time sensitive. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 03:17:43
Yup. Totally true. I might look at trying to ad some solder to it if possible to prevent that. It does however have a locking mechanism in place to prevent that. I probably could also glue the screw that enables it to open.

I got blasted on the other post with the t-shirt that has the antifa looking dude in the front throwing a Bitcoin. Got blasted because I said it didn't paint a good picture of what Bitcoin really is and all people wanted to tell me was it was fine art and I should just know that. Lol. Kept trying to explain how people like me who don't know anything about art will not understand that and form an opinion....kept getting blasted for know knowing who banksy was. Still don't know because I still don't care about art. Lol 
@_date: 2017-10-14 04:24:54
I've bought at $1800, $2300, $2500, $3k, $4k, and then again at $5300. We will looks back and be like, damn we got that shit super cheap. I will not stop buying, but unless a major crash happens those full Bitcoin purchases are gone for me!

Been saying this all along. Hodl and buy the dip. Couple that with investing a reasonable amount and you're set. I will admit, I've invested a shit ton, I'm just willing to lose it like a nut bag. I'm also in this not to get rich, but for a slew of other reasons.  being it's my money and no one can take it.

We get it, cool, you've been around the block. $7500 is support, if we bounce off of it again there won't be a 3rd bounce, people are fine. I'm tired of these retarded ass "you don't know what blood is" posts. Thanks �� you're so smart and please tell me that story again. I'm just tired of reading this shit, it's the tred on this sub right now...like no one is aware. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:36:46
Yea but see unlike everyone else, I question everything. For instance, I was curious as to why all of a sudden i see nothing but negative nacys and people making wild ass comments that clealry know nothing about Bitcoin. In fact, you're one of them. More on that soon. See Reddit has this cool thing where I can look at people accounts so I started looking into the accounts that seemed really odd, and what do you know, each one of them is an account that either hasn't ever commented on this sub before or they are new accounts. 
So you for instance, I don't see a comment from you in this sub (I looked back 10 days and that's as far as I was willing to go), but I do see you making dumbass comments on other subs about Bitcoin like you even know what it is. You've said this before:


This is all I needed to know for me to realize you're also a stupid fuck just like the rest. Zero research and you sound like an idiot. I actually lol'ed at the word "account". My God you have no idea how Bitcoin works and I bet you don't even know what a private/public key is. So yes, maybe I am representing Bitcoin poorly but I'm making it my duty to absolutely rekt every single one of you plebs that pretends to know at all what is going on. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 05:53:25
That's the other thread 
@_date: 2018-02-27 20:44:46
I agree. I can't fucking stand these light themes. I'd probably use the Reddit app less if I couldn't have it black. I don't care how nice the UI looks....if it's brighter than the sun I will hate it. Why do devs not know this yet? Just give us the option to change it? It's not a very difficult thing to do. Shit on the web it's a flip of a bit to a different css file. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 14:06:02
Manipulation? It's like you retards have no brain. Price goes down.... MANIPULATION....price goes up.....TO THE MOON FUCKERS.  GTFO. I hope you get rekt. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:21:25
Avg block time, which is not always the case. More likely than not it doesn't take nearly that long for my btc to show up in an exchange. And I've purchased shit that was available in much much less time. Also you are so short sighted you can't see past what it is right now. Of course this isn't ready for mass adoption....but it will be. You're only focused on numbers and can't see what the technology can and will be even 1-2 years from now. We will iterate on it and it will only get better and better and more widely adopted. This train cannot be stopped. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 07:03:46
Bruh that's everyday. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 06:52:36
Depends on what you are doing. If you believe in the fundamentals hodl. If you are trying to make more btc, not sure what to do here. Some think it's coming back some think this is a dead cat bounce. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:02:01
Totally agree. Bought more at $4400 hodling and waiting to see if it continues down so I can buy more!

Same here. I bought in at $1800 and bought maybe 5% of my savings. Still was a good amount. I had a chance when it dipped down to $1800 breifly but I was young and didn't know to buy the dip. Lol. Still, super happy with what I have. I won't stop buying, but buying full bitcoins is over for me.

Good shit. Yup I did something similar back in 2010 and it's how I found out I have a gluten issue. I was supposed to take nexiun the rest of my life (started taking it at 19, I'm 32 now) and I was able to quit taking it because I found out what was actually causing most of my problems. Yes modern medicine can do wonders, but I'd say in most instances a simple (but hard to do) diet change is all that is needed.

@_date: 2017-10-25 17:10:37
I want as much as I can. Bitcoin heading to a lower price for an extended period of time allows me to obtain more. Will I cash it out? Only as needed if Bitcoin ever hits a certain amount. I would like to use it to retire early and travel the world.

@_date: 2018-03-31 03:41:33
I'm sorry. As someone who works 40 - 60 hours on a given week, selling at an acceptable high just isn't the right move. Shit, I thought $7500 was the high last year. Anyway, this is easier said than done for someone like me who works a ton, hodls their private keys, and doesn't do charting. Hodl and buy the dip. For me it's that simple. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:01:33
People will tell you on here, never invest more than you are willing to lose, and they are right. I agree with them. In reality I have way more invested in Bitcoin than I'm ok with losing, but I also have a nice buffer since I bought in May. Word is it's going to start trading on LedgerX soon and we are about to get a shit ton more volume, more than even now. I expect it to be $10k by the end of the year and some think even more. No one knows. Shit it could dump down to $3k with a country coming out and telling us they are banning it (it happens alot). Or China could com back out and un-ban exchanges and the price will surge. It's a gamble sure, but what keeps me going is if you look at the chart, anyone who has never sold has never lost. If it dips, you don't sell. Even if it's for a loooong period of time. I also suggest you read up on Bitcoin if you haven't already. My friends think Bitcoin is Monopoly money as well...jokes on them and they are in complete denile when I told them to invest months ago.

I have friends who live down there. They get paid on Friday and if they don't spend it right away, their Fiat is worth less by Monday. Bitcoin is an exit for them. In times of chaos and hyper inflation, people want an exit. Gold would surge as well. Fiat is just Monopoly money made of paper.

Who the hell takes out a loan to buy shit like this? Just asking to become homeless. And im a pretty irrational guy with my money. I boight .9 btc when it was $4300 with money from my life savings....but hey im not going like mortgage payment type in debt. Lol wow people are dumb. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 00:12:36
Your friendly Bitcoin CEO here. Just want to remind you to hodl and buy the dip!
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:14:00
Gold also doesn't fucking move in price hardly ever. We will all die before we see another $1k+ in price. Also, no one uses gold to buy things like we do bitcoin....so why are you even comparing the two? You mention "money" and "gold" and refer to two different things, I dont think you know what you are talking about. Pick one and talk to it.
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:45:38
What are you even talking about? I can trade on GDAX with Bitcoin/USD pairs without any issues. As for your argument about not dealing with any banks...how on Earth do you aquire the USDT in the first place without buying it through a bank wire? Can that even be done? I dont know a single person who has cashed out to real USD from USDT. Your going to have to elaborate on your bank wire transfer argument because it doesn't even make any sense.
@_date: 2018-02-12 03:52:08
I'm torn on it. However I'm leaning towards we are building up pressure to shoot above $10k. It will take alot however. I bought a goo chunk around $8k because feel like we have bottomed. Cautiously optimistic however. Overall the news and tone on the internet has been WAY more bullish lately.

What did you not get about this line? You simple minds can't even understand what is going on here. Bitcoin is MY money, not the banks or the united states goverments. My concern is mass adoption and somehow im not surprised you didnt understand that even though 90% of the post you replied to was about that.

It only takes one thing to go wrong for you to lose it all. I look at everything I own as if Bitcoin is already worth $100k. Too risky for me. I'm fine getting paid less to minimize risk. Greed is what kills people in this crypto space. I've been there...I tried trading and I lost. Never again. I'm happy with what I have. Also you might not want to publicly say how much you have online. Lol why do people feel so safe? Hackers are brilliant, they will do the unexpected and it's too late when you find out you've been had.

Welcome, and you are still frugal. Even though Bitcoin could half tomorrow (doubt it)… I look Bitcoin as my savings account on steroids. I'm young enough to risk this. As for the wallet, I'm not familiar with electrum, but I have a bank ledger s. I have everything on that thing, but I'm wondering if I should split things up myself. I feel comfortable and safe using my ledger, and I think someone would need to physically steal it from me to even begin to hack it. Getting you're shit off an exhnage should be prio  Just make sure that before you use electrum to make sure you have a backup. Maybe send a little bit first to see if it works and you are comfortable with it. Every if the fees are high. We have all done it.

Lol you know what, people were telling me I wasn't smart for selling all my alts because "thats what everyone else is doing". Luckily I sold ealry enough and I wasn't caught with my pants down this time. I'm never going back to alts. Holding eth over Bitcoin since spring wouldn't have been a good idea. It needs to be over $800 right now to be worth the same amount in BTC at ETHs all time high.  Don't listen to I people on Reddit, do what you want to do, but the smart ones all come back to BTC. 99% of this alts will be shit down the road and I'm aware of this now.

I'm not taking anything personally from a guy who thought the market cap of Bitcoin was 9 billion. All that tells me is you think your wit is smarter than doing any actual research. Lol It even breached that back in Jan 2014, and then again towards the end of 2016, and has grown exponentially since then. The keyword is exponentially....which is the kind of growth to be expected from a currency that allows people to freely use money outside of their government and banks. So yes! I do believe it will eventually get to $500k. Is it wild? Sure its wild, but so is Bitcoin and how innovative it is. It's like asking wtf email was back in the 90's. Why do you think all these banks and governments are shitting their pants?....because Satoshi Nakamoto developed a system and wrote a white paper as to how we can all operate outside of what we are told with no way to stop it. It's crucial to our existence in a world where automation it taking over. It's only going to get more sci-fi from here on out.

A blockchain is just a linked list database if it isn't decentralized. Decentralization is what makes the Blockchain revelant and powerful. I'd put more emphasis on that.

1) usually things bought account for fees paid by the buyer not seller, which is why you will see businesses offering discounts if used. 
2) Transaction fees are not only much cheaper today, but will be so minimal down the road non of us will feel it. 
3) I'd much rather pay a small fee to use my own money than money that isn't mine. 
4) half your arguments were valid in 2017, this is 2018 where LN will makes all these arguments completely invalid. Some how though I feel like this "fees fees fees" argument will not die ever. Too many fucking sheep out there. People pay monthly for their checking accounts, to take out money from Atms, and credit card company's charge ridiculous amounts in fees which gets passed to the buyer. Take your wack ass outdated arguments somewhere else.

Lol I love this strategy. I've started buying regularly now regardless of price. I'm a hodler so I don't care where it's at. I'd admit, since I've finally grown balls and I'm aware of the way things are, I always buy the dip. Luckily I'm so far ahead if would have to take a major crash for me to feel the heat. Even then I'd be buying more!
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:19:43
I'm right there with you. I didn't buy this dip because I bought another large amount because I though $4400 was the dip. Which it actually probably would have been if it wasn't for all the bad news. I learned...now I'm always going to have reserves of shit fiat ready to dump into a BTC dip

Yea once atomic swaps are possible....I can't wait to trade with people on Twitter man. What a beautiful thing this crypto is turning into. They know it is coming. Also funny how much they have made and they just now added phone support. They know they are the one of the only games in town...I honestly don't know where else to buy any. I should find out because I too will not use coinbase since they support this bullshit.

@_date: 2017-10-20 04:29:33

I have a medium to large gpu mining setup, so much so we needed to install new electric. It's been "profitable" so far simple because we could liquidate the gpu for about 80% of their worth. In fact we are looking to sell them for S9's. Everyone on here will tell you mining isn't profitable....which if you are trying to pay off the equipment then start making money....it might not be. I still don't know yet because this is all new to me and I'm not the one actually risking the money, I'm just the software guy. If you are going to buy GPUs I'd suggest GTX 1070s or GTX 1080tis.  If you are going to get the TI's prepare to only mine zcash with them. We have also made enough in Bitcoin to buy 3 S9s outright so yea was have to look at it as there needs to be some kind of ROI, but it did feel nice expanding our setup with money we made. Our goal never was to pay back the loan in a quick fashion either. We will probably liquidate all gpus before the next Nvidia architecture is released. By then I think there will be PCIe ASICS available

I will admit though..when I first started in crypto I was planning on doing this, but as time when on and I opened up my mind, you quickly realize that's just like stirring your money in the bank which is what we are all trying to get away from. We own our own money now! What a glorious future ahead we have! And the government doesn't know how much I even own!

For one, no JP Morgan didn't buy Bitcoin, youre only reading headlines because if you think they bought Bitcoin after what Jamie said...that's just plan stupid. Their company never bought any, and the articles and links floating around saying they did were just plan stupid. Lol why would JP Morgan buy Bitcoin and use their name to do so? They wouldn't. Second, I never once said it hit the market cap of gold, you can't read. Lastly you think I'm basing my shit off of what happened in the past will happen in the future by strictly looking at the charts. See that's where you and I are at a complete disconnect because I don't give a fuck about any charts. Im only concerned with the technology and what it means for the world. You only see numbers, I see the decentralized blockchain changing the world in a way your tiny brain can't even imagine. The internet, money, data, smart contracts, and so much more will be used in the future like we use email today...it's based upon that reason as why some of us believe this shit could go sky fucking high and it's not unreasonable. The technology behind bictoin WILL revolutionize the world and it would almost be irrational to think Bitcoin would surge beyond imagination as a result. Ina world where the internet and all echcnages are decentralized, Bitcoin will be the most sought after thing. You'll be that idiot that sold at some previous ATH.

One could think that the electricity that run all the banks is a lot larger than Bitcoin. Sure there are a ton of miners, but think about corporate buildings, flights for corporate workers, electricity for every bank. This is why I just laugh when someone trys to sayining Bitcoin will boil the Earth's water or something stupid. To me, all it does is incentivize decentralized electricity. You don't think people will start to find creative ways to mine Bitcoin and avoid electricity costs?

I am using relevant metrics. It's segwit.party. Your photo shows Blockchain.info and doesn't account for batch transactions and more and more exhanges are doing so, which results in less transactions. Coupled with the use of Segwit adoption, it's more. Nice try cherry picking your data ��

The ledger nano s is worth every penny. If you can get it before the next split...they handled the last one without any issues and it was so gracefully done. As for backup, I mean there is 12 to 24 seed word given to you as a way to recover your wallet. Me needing to know if shit was working, I would create the electrum wallet, write down the 24 word phrase, send some Bitcoin to it (like $1 worth) and then see if I can recover the wallet either on another PC, or on the same machine after uninstalling, deleting all files, and reinstalling then recover it. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:18:00
Are you completely unaware of all these echnages batching their transactions and how segwit changed the block by weight? These statistics mean shit when the blocks go by weight now. You're arguing with me about something different, and clearly you don't understand. 
The blocksize is consistently going up...not down. Therefore yes there is more volume now that before segwit going through each block. You're argument is invalid as there is more going through with yes, less transactions. I can't wait to hear you explain how the blocks are larger but the volume (transactional).

I bet this also allows for trading of Bitcoin the echange doesn't even own. I don't know shit about the stock exchange or wall street but that's what it sounds like to me.

My only hope is that Bitcoin would break this kind of trend... considering all the other exhnages that are not regulated like this will be.

@_date: 2018-02-15 02:10:45
In Bitcoin years, that feels like an eternity. I entered last may, that feels like a lifetime ago.

Wake me up at $50k. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:54:28
Lol good luck on that. I could only wish we would see it that low, sure my money invested already would mean shit, but I would be part of the 21 club for sure then.

Just pull back on the chart a bit

I'm aware, are you aware that this is planned to be done on bitcoin as well?
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:11:58


How in the fuck are people even still saying this? Jesus Christ it's like people just spew out the garbage they take in without any thought process at all
@_date: 2018-02-10 14:19:29
This can't be true, because I will GLADLY buy using Bitcoin over USD every day of the week. I'd love to pay all my bills in Bitcoin. For now, I would just rebuy what I spend....until I can get paid in Bitcoin. Plus, say it reaches $1 million...you don't think I'm spending that shit? 
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:54:30
Started this a while ago. I feel like I'm pissing away my hard earned money when I put it in fiat savings. Also I don't feel like I own my fait savings. I sure as FUCK own my BTC savings. Feels good. Feels so damn good. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:41:07
Carry on sir. Forgive me
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:59:38
Very first things I do in this order... 
- Blockfolio refresh
- Visit coinmarketcap.com
- Check out this sub
Reddit is basically just my Bitcoin information checker app. Love you guys....even though I'm an ass most of the time!
@_date: 2017-09-09 07:12:23
It's nuts what some news from one fucking website can do to bitcoin. Just shows you how we are still in the infancy and it's still a great time to buy! I assume the more we grow and the more mature it is, we will only trust news like this if it is reported world wide. It's clear someone was trying to initiate a major crash. Didn't go so well did it?
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:34:02
@_date: 2017-10-03 14:20:21
Thank you
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:09:00
I can't wait to see the pump wall street brings. Probably will follow with a major crash, I'll buy moar!
@_date: 2017-10-25 04:42:08
Yea I can't see it going sideways either. I can only dream. I'm still buying.  
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:32:59
Well duh. Lol I never no why people react so harshly to this. It's not like it even put a dent in the momentum or price. Ok it crashed a bit...but not enough where I even feel comfortable calling it a crash. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:13:15
Hold on a second here....nothing is done with accumulated_work. Seems like legit code to me!
@_date: 2017-10-03 05:14:30
No. Let those fucking retards stay there....we don't need to be flooded with the idiots over at r/btc in this sub. God it would ruin this sub.

I'm actually shocked the number isn't higher. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 14:32:20
I had a screen shot of my passcode. Was an awful idea so I deleted it. I also have a crypto steel so that's much safer. You don't want that shit on any phone, device, or cloud storage anyway. Although OP should have written it down somewhere, maybe even multiple instances of it. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:56:47
Couldn't agree more. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:05:05

"Don’t be surprised if other nations follow China’s lead and ban — as I like to call them — bitcons"
You guys hear that? You're all bitcons. Hahaha I had a good laugh at this. Thanks OP. 
Also, I'd love for people pushing this retard for a source since he's saying "I'm hearing blah blah blah". 
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:20:40
I look at every amount of BTC I have as a future fuck ton of money. That's why I don't cash any out. I have done this before to try to get more and all I've ever done was lose BTC. Not saying you need to do what I do, just trying to help a fellow bitcoiner not lose their bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:58:52
I thought I heard ledgerx was only trading the actual coin?
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:39:20
I always tend to buy high as well. Just shows how I don't have balls to buy the dip as much as I would like to. Good thing my hodling balls are iron klad. Buying alot at $1800 also helps.

They can hardly afford to buy real food....but yet these assholes are doing shit like this? I don't believe it. That government is so corrupt and they will lie about anything. Fuck Maduro and fuck the Venezuela government. They have trashed what should be a beautiful (and rich) country. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:44:31
Still retarded they don't accept Bitcoin. I find it hilarious I can't pay in the currency that the fucking thing mines. I hate them SO much. I'll gladly swap my S9s for Samsung the first moment I can.

Fuck outta here, I'm in fountain hill. Which subway?
@_date: 2017-10-20 03:36:29
I'll be buying as long as Bitcoin is relevant. What I meant was I would buy .5 more now as a future gift for myslef 
@_date: 2018-07-22 14:25:28
Anyone who doesn't want to leave their money to thier kids just has no fucking soul. Do you think you're taking that shit with you? Lol. My God. Stop commenting. Either I'm being trolled or you're seriously the worst person I've come across on Reddit.

An actual shitcoin 
@_date: 2017-10-06 18:16:17
I just meant my BTC is still worth the same in BTC. I Dont care about USD value. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:09:58
Yup Sam here. Had one interested friend and he alsmot bought some and then his wife read an article with the word "China" in it and immediately was like "I'm not buying anything China is involved with." Lol. Even after multiple times explaining...they are still against it even after it has gone up so much since I first told them. Doubt they ever will because they missed the boat. I'm done talking to them. Suckas going to feel like shit when I roll up in the Lambo. Lol jk I might never own one. Maybe though. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 03:42:44
This is fine. Also doubt a bear market that long... especially with more eyes on it. Idk why people think because it happened in the past it will happen again. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 04:00:42
Damn...I didn't even think of that because someone told me Amazon as well. Ok well I'll have two now because I'm not going to support that shit.

Lol stop
@_date: 2017-10-30 19:54:29
God I hope you are right. I only would think of it more from the side that these old guys can't change. They see it as a threat to their shit Fiat lump sums. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:21:12
For me, Bitcoin is my money and that's why I believe it was gaining so much speed. Then all the greedy fucks entered in. To say it's greed like the top comment is false imo. More then 3/4 of last year people were on this sub talking about how it's our money for the first time in centruries. I like this. I like my money more than I like fiat. I know people like me are still out there, and I think a majority of people like me might not be so outspoken like the others who are here just to make a buck. I'm hodling Bitcoin until I can use it, not cash it out for the very same currency I'm hedging against. Fuck the corrupt banks and government, this is why I Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:17:19
Perfect execution. I miss people like you in this sub. Apparently everyone on this sub knows everything now without spending any time learning it. Just felt the need to say thank you for the  
@_date: 2017-10-12 15:14:13
New GPU miner here at medium to large scale....it's profitable. We aren't mining Bitcoin however. We have earned  enough to though where we bought some S9s and now we are phasing out equipment (selling the rigs as a whole rig) and we will actually make money on the equipment, and buying more S9s. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 15:08:04
Ok this is what I didn't know. Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 00:56:42
I'm not sure because I own a ledger and there has been a 2x option since the bcash update. They made it beyond simple and I trust them. Best purchase I have ever made in crypto. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 23:24:57
You clearly don't understand what we are trying to accomplish here. If Amazon starts excepting Bitcoin tomorrow....I'm ONLY shopping at Amazon if possible. And yes I agree, I don't want to lose my Bitcoin amount either so I would just replenish it. I believe in the technology and the more we use it the more we don't have to worry about Fiat. The goal is not having to sell your BTC for Fiat. This kind of hodl and never use BTC mentality is for the birds man. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:28:12
Some speculate that bcash will end up being ultra mined like it was just now during the fork....in an attempt to make 2x the Bitcoin chain. Let's hope it's fud. I simply don't know how it will play out. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:38:43
Unfortunately im stuck using coinbase for now. I will check out gemini. I dont plan on using coinbase ever again after this split.  
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:02:31
I love the idea of this, I just wonder if it will ever be possible to buy BTC with USD on a decentralized exchange. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 21:49:43
Which is part of the decentralized network, mining the blocks and validating them through nodes. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 04:11:09
yea, its not vertical enough.
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:38:11
I regret trying to trade shitcoins and losing some BTC while doing so. Very happy with the amount I have thoigh! We are still super early don't forget! People will say you're  in 2019 as "Regretting not buying back in 2017". I know all my friends sure will say that. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 03:48:59
I'm half in on my life savings and it feels good. Wife isn't very happy but hey we can always build our savings back up. Let buy this shit while we can boys. We are the early adopters and just think down the road even .1 will be rare and unattainable for most. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:29:47
Nah we want that 2x coin because it will at minimum bring me .5 BTC if I was able to sell today. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:23:21
Noooo it definitely isn't too late now. Just think how much it will go up once wall street starts to trade it. Man they are going to make that shit blow up.
@_date: 2017-10-08 01:33:52
Lol this is the funniest thing I've seen here this week. Bravo. Also shows how much of a joke shitcoin trash is.

USD == ponsi
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:58:02
Sorry, I'd be pissed at my reply as well. It was dickish and not helpful. Maybe you actually trashed the CPU some how? I know UNIX but I'm not really a Mac OSX guy so did you lower the thread count after that? I vaguely remember reading year ago that kind of thread count would actually be too high. Idk though with thier new shit. Can I assume you have removed the mining program and validated the threads are not running in the background?
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:46:37
I literally just said I don't borrow money... 
@_date: 2017-09-17 03:19:58
Mad respect for you.... Bought a second ledger for the very same reason. Sure it can be recovered, but what if one shit the bed and I needed it NOW. I was thinking about keeping my 2nd one in a safe deposit box...but idk. I sure do feel like a super 007 Bond villain using these things. Lol.

Lol yea it's only gonna be $2
@_date: 2017-10-20 04:36:05
As a computer scientist and libertarian....Bitcoin is a fucking dream come true. I'm still learning oh how the protocol and the network works but my god it has consumed me. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:35:58
Jesus christ, no wonder why we have so many idiots in this sub lately. A fee estimater? No one can even think for themselves. You also don't say $6.80 for how much being sent.
Looking at   for just 2 fucking seconds I can see that send a transaction for 10 sat/byte....which is not expensive at all. Oh and I would get into the FIRST block. How about being dependant on tools you learn how the shit works instead of being dependant on shitty tools you're using and spreading nonsense Garbage around this sub. It's clear I have no patience for this bullshit anymore
@_date: 2018-02-12 03:58:28
Yes. 2 months is like 2 years in Bitcoin. Shit, it feels like we have been in a bear market for a year. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:34:22
It just sucks that bitcoins adoption is also closely aligned with countries like Venezuela who is just trashing which once was a beautiful and prosperous nation. I too want Bitcoin to be mass apdipted, just sucks that it has to be this way. Then again, it also proves as to why Bitcoin is needed in the first place. It's just tough to watch and see. I've seen some wild shit out of Venezuela through a buddy that lives down there. They are starving not only for food, but a currency where their money is worth less on Monday after being paid on Friday. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:59:32
They you will have them at a discounted rate.

Repost be like
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:00:13
You are just being air dropped a new coin. Every time someone forks off and creates a new coin you get the same amount of that coin as you have BTC. It's 1:1. The cost of that air dropped coin, in this case 2x, is based off of it's market value. If it goes to 0 you lose nothing, you still have your BTC. If it goes to $1000, which God please let it pump just once like shitcoin cash....good for us we can dump it and have more BTC!
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:21:43
Yea I'm fine getting a lower price. My main concern is that my shit is safe. I'm not willing to lose my coins just to rush 2x out the door. Part of me also thinks unlike BCH, it would be smart to hold 2x just in case these asshole really are able to make the Bitcoin chain as we know it obsolete. The retards at are openly talking about it. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:11:30
I'm not sure what's worse...that he's a fucking robot and has no soul, or the fact that his ego is so big this video is still up on his YouTube after the disaster was clearly Mt Gox fault..

Will a Tesla roar in my ear? Then nah. It will be my every day car maybe though. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 02:54:46
100% agree. I sold nothing. Looking back I should have ..but that time has past. I fear losing Bitcoin so I hodl and buy the dip. I bought some at $6500, don't care where it goes, I'll buy lower as well. Dollar cost avg is your friend. Also, no one knows where it's going...to say the bear market isn't or is over, is just laughable. Hodl and buy the dip, it's worked for people throughout all of Bitcoin history, I will continue to do it. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 05:48:54
Which brand? 
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:09:19
2 articles on the front page involving real estate. I don't know much about the real estate industry but I'm assuming they like money. Seeing people in this industry embrace Bitcoin is an amazing sign of things to come. I believe Bitcoin is a great medium for such transactions. I would much rather purchase my house using Bitcoin that have to deal with the bank when I bought mine years ago. I'm sure the next time I buy I would still have to use a bank, but the people who have the money in Bitcoin being able to cut middle men out....this is amazing 
@_date: 2018-02-17 14:06:56
Because he's a shill for bcash. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 02:23:38
Welcome to excellece. They handled the Bcash split so gracefully and I expect nothing less for this next shitcoin split. You are now a Bond villain like the rest of us.

 Not my fault he didn't know shit when Jimmy had a show with him...

I'm expecting it to kill Bitcoin Trash when the 2x split happens. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 02:00:19
Did anyone else read the title as implying that 2x had replay protection? No replay protection, I don't want anything to do with it. I'm just glad ledger makes it simple for me to split and I don't have to worry about losing my precious BTC. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:03:09
no this is the correct place to shit on eth, i've been out of eth since july. i was a noob and i listened to everyone (not here) and thought it would also just go up with bitcoin. ya live and ya learn, its a shit coin, look at how it just gets paralyzed as all the other shit coins when Bitcoin is lighting the world on fire. Might be  in market cap, but I also remember when eth was overloaded when everyone was dumping it, you couldn't transfer eth for 3 days. What a joke. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:51:20
Completely agree. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:56:03

@_date: 2017-10-31 23:49:03
Just for the record, iota is a shitcoin 
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:52:08
It's just irresponsible to store your coins on an exchange. Idk about you but I prefer being safe vs trying to be the first to dump. All too often I see on this sub posts about people being hacked.
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:26:08
I remember this feeling last time BTC was on fire...if BTC goes down so will the alts. I'm dumping all my alts. I've only ever lost BTC because of alts. I'm fucking done with them. Never lost USD, but I definitely have less BTC than I have originally bought. Lesson learned. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:30:51
Why didn't you confirm my confirm if your confirm?
@_date: 2017-10-10 04:39:13
Dear God I would throw a party and hand out $10 in BTC to everyone there. Lol that's all they get. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:05:03
On alts...yes. Maybe indefinite pull back. Lol
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:55:56
Steve jobs also did like no Engineering. I respect woz more. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 21:48:05
That's on coinbase...not bitcoins fault. You can set lower fees when sending Bitcoin yourself. Complain to coinbase, not the Bitcoin community. I've sent Bitcoin for pennies before.
Edit: oh this is your first post ever and no comments. These paid shills man. I thought we were done with this shit. Lol
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:49:57
For someone so confident you sure are quite dumb. What do you think will happen when it hits the market cap of gold? What do you think will happen when it's adopted on a mass scale? It's even better than gold and can be spent on things. Take your negative and brain dead ass somewhere else. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:10:20
Ew, I don't want that. I wouldn't waste my money on one then. I want that thing roaring in my ear
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:46:15
Good luck, Bitcoin headed to $6k leaving them all in the dust further.
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:28:16
Exactly. I see so many people talking about dumping their bgold asap...which I think isn't a good idea. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:29:16
Yup. Just remember if you never sell you never lose. It could dip below where you bought but have confidence and learn about what this technology is and does. Learn how it works (of you haven't already) and it will open your mind. Sounds super cliche but for me...it has changed me and my life long goal is to have a commit accepted. Will take a long time and I have alot to learn still. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:30:13
Lol redotor for 4 days. The conspiracy theorist in me wants to think these accounts are just getting memes to the top so we don't keep talking about 2x. Anyone else feel like people on this sub are trying to convince us it is over when it clearly isn't? 
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:48:16
Still, update your node bruh. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:19:03
I'd love to see a vast majority of miners switch to the pools that won't mine 2x come mid November. That would be sweet if it just killed antpool.

Title mentions MSM...that's "they" 
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:29:46
Lol combat? So the savers are the problem. Gotcha. We are supposed to just spend everything we make. I assume the way the banks “combat”it is by issuing more money, which is the exact reason why people want to own bitcoin, it’s deflationary. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 03:55:13
Probably trying to slow this shit down. Wall street doesn't even have their hands on it. Well the smart ones do. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 01:13:29
I can't wait to see what the plebs excuse for jumping ship on btrash is and joining the 2x hype train. At this point, I think it might be best is 2x happens. The whole world will see 2x and btrash implode and what forks really are made of....which is no support and shit devs. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:07:09
I was thinking about that earlier...and by then I would think we would be trading on a different scale right? People buying mBTC instead of 1 BTC maybe?
@_date: 2018-02-17 14:07:26
Titel of video is "Bitcoin cash". Get this shit out of here. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 21:58:44
It's beyond me as to why people still continue to keep thier hard earned Bitcoin online or on a cloud service. Like for shits sake, it's like people can't learn. I read about people being hacked weekly and yet here they are... completely shocked they got hacked and now it's probably "fuck Bitcoin" for them. I don't feel sorry for them one bit. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:14:44
everyone is freaking out....when they should all be happy as fuck that they can buy more now for cheaper. im still buying, i hope everyone gets fucking rekt who is selling. there is literally no sell pressure going upwards on GDAX

Then you obviously don't know shit because a large amount of the block are all over 1mb. Also the number of Segwit transactions is increasing. Are you just dense? Why would anyone expect something so new to be 100% adoption overnight? That would be wreckless. No developer is just going to beast out their shit unless they are 100% positive there are no bugs, or at minimum, breaking bugs.

Yea they are addicting, and I'm a compulsive person. The only purchase in this world ever that I made at a drop of a hat and paid off was buying Bitcoin at $1800. Since then all I ever did was lose some BTC by getting caught with my pants down during the last BTC boom from $2k to $4k. It won't happen ever again. Lol im don't with alts for that matter. I knew this was coming and I wish I would have pulled out earlier. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:45:35
I think he means if you turned the chart upside down?
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:41:41
Lol @ you trying to act like core isn't the real Bitcoin. If you want to discuss alts I suggest you stick to then and enjoy all the circle jerking lies you're fed. It's beyond me how dumb people can be in large groups.

Yo GTFO. I just told my wife we don't have enough to be super rich but maybe retire in 17 years at 50 years old. Lol. I also said I wanted an RV to do the same thing because I'm terrified of flying. Haha 
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:21:00
Lol true. Wtf. I know myself, I'll never sell. Haha. I am however planning on buying a used Ferrari of it hits $100k....maybe wait a bit after that if it looks like it's going to go further just so I can spend less in BTC for it.

@_date: 2017-10-16 02:48:14
Miner support is dropping, that's the only thing 2x has that bcash didn't. Look at the amount of nodes as well, it's overwhelmingly more in the case of core. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:18:29
I can't wait for the $1000 swings. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:27:25
Hold up. HOLD UP. I want to be able to move my 401k over to Bitcoin...I doubt it but fidelity make this happen and I will stay forever
Edit: actually, now I'm wondering if I should just take out my 401k now and buy Bitcoin with it. Fuck the early removal fees. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:32:37
For now sure. Actually the original pseudocode I used was wrong then because bcash is 8mb. I changed it. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:23:08
Yea it's never increased 100x since it's inception. Let me roll my eyes so hard into the back of my head. Also coming from a guy who thinks the market cap was 9 bill. Lol
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:22:06
Yea that's not at all what I'm talking about. I meant some kind of standards like the IEEE is. I can tell from the downvotes people either disagree of didn't understand. I'm not sure I would agree with it either. I was just pointing out how half assed bgold is and we are dealing with people's money here. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:55:25
It makes perfect sense. The transaction was sent with low fees, not all miners will even mine that shit. The only reason a coin like Shitcoin cash would mine something like this is because it would be mining 40 block in an hour. Shit the next day it might take a full 24 hours for shitcoin cash to mine it because all the miners left again. Lol. They are just making a fool out of the devs and those shitty logic. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 23:26:55

You're not an asshole idiot. Don't mind your own Bitcoin...if I would have listed to the people here I should have spent the $2500 I did on mining equipment on Bitcoin and I would be much better off than I am now. Have you bought any Bitcoin yet?
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:19:15
Yea you might have to find out a way to split it successfully. I don't know shit about bgold and I need to read up on it. If bgold doesnt have replay protection that concerns me. Ledger came out and said they will support it so I wasn't too worried.
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:16:26
Nope. For sure the safest. I'm just trying to point out how giving out info on the internet sure can fuck yourself. If I'm a hacker and I'm in your shit I'm for sure listening if you open that software on your PC, your trezor wallet. Now that I know you own one. More importantly, I know you have Bitcoin I might just be listening to see if a Bitcoin address has been copied and I will overwrite that paste and if you move to quickly you could send to to wrong address. I've read about people who have had that happen to them. Just broadcasting that you own some could fuck you....then again one could assume we all do on this sub. I'm just saying it's best to be safe. I don't feel safe with anything, the moment you are that's when you're at risk.

Ledger has come out and said they will support 2x (not as in they really support the movement but I can split my shit), it's my understanding that ledger is a lightweight wallet as well, is the OP saying I'm screwed after the fork?
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:01:52


That actually is so true. I think sound traders know people will think because either happened last time it will ahooen that way again. Which is why I could see a dump of BTC happen right before 2x. The last time BTC was fine when bcash was split...I expect people will think the same thing will happen, and then they get dumped on. This is why we hodl and buy the dip. It's all speculation and we are always caught off guard at what the price will do. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:38:07
Lol for real. In a day where people need instant gratification...I bet that's why there are so many weak hands. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:51:24


...proceeds to tell us the floor ��. I hope you're right man, but no one knows. All I know is I'm buying alllll the way down this bitch and eventually I'll catch the bottom. Dollar cost average is your friend. If you think it's $5500, you are the only one then, buy above that.

Just think about it....2 years at a much lower price AND you can keep buying. Do you know how much more I could buy I'm the next 2 years with it at that price? Maybe double what I have now. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:50:17
Welp, I'm short alot from that. Fuck I thought I was retiring in 10 years. Lol. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 05:40:36

God the day we see the term "hodl" used in finance on daily basis...we will have done it man. It's amazing how so much good came from a mistake. The hodl mentality isn't just good for Bitcoin, it's changed how I manage my money and how much more aware I am of what garbage I buy with my hard earned money. If the masses start using this term and people here it they will want to know what it is about...leading them to find out what a glorious methodology it is to just hodl....then masses hodl and to the moon we go. Fuck man, I can't wait for a day where I can buy everything in Bitcoin, I hope I love to see it. I'm 33. Lol. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:53:50
It's funny how it's quite the opposite. The sheep over at seriously are convinced they are forking the real Bitcoin...for a 2nd time...then they claim it's decentralized and core isn't. I'd like to know how people are so blind and dumb. 
Edit: also lets not forget just a month ago segwit was the main reason the community was all in on bcash and now they are all trying to figure out ways to kill core in favor of 2x. I doubt any of them would even be able to talk their way out of that one. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:40:24

@_date: 2018-02-15 23:52:11
Being a programmer myself, I swear coinbase doesnt do unit testing. This has happened, plus the ability to exploit BTC purchases with bcash. Their back end has to be completely fucked. It's beyond me why they haven't been hacked yet. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:37:00
Most will have to switch pools to a non-2x pool, let's hope this happens. I wish they would do it already but maybe they are waiting?
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:31:38
I for one, am in no rush to dump my bgold. Ledger said they will support it, I will wait for them to release their updates and wait again until it's confirmed working fine. No reason to rush into things and end up losing your Bitcoin. I wonder how much Bitcoin gets burned from shit like this. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:47:34
I'm not following, are you acting 17 trillion is or isn't reasonable?
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:44:21
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:18:04
I would not recommend that at all. Then you don't get your free airdrop. Me, Im getting mine and if it looks to be the dump fest like bcash was...I'm dumping asap. If you want to be sure, I'd say hodl both. Hodling both will ensure you do not lose a thing. I'm a holder, until death does me part.

I wanted to buy more last night and didn't. Guess I'm waiting for a dip. I'm just hoping we go to $6k - $7k and dip down to $5k. Even if I never buy again I'm super happy with what I have. We are all winning today guys. No matter what amount you have 
@_date: 2018-07-04 20:31:09
...and free
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:34:38
Yea I'm actually worried about this and I have a ledger. I haven't seen anything from ledger, then again I haven't really looked. I should. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:51:46
I'm curious about ledger as well because I read that the lightworght wallets when you transfer it goes on the chain with the most hash power. I know that ledger has had a 2x option in the wallet since the last split, but I would love to know more. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 01:08:37
You deserve all the upvotes

I legit lol'ed at this by myself. I dont lol by myself. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:41:05
Yea I had a good amount of neo and I made some. I hate myself for not selling high. Was a learning experience for me. I might still try to trade eventually....but only with newly bought BTC because God damn if I ever lost what I have now I would hate myself. I'd love to see a dip to $4800, but yea I wouldn't be shocked if we never saw that again as well. Part of me wants to sell some right before $10k in hopes to buy more during the dip but that's a slippery slope. I always talk like I'm going to do shit but if I'm being honest I ain't selling shit and just buying more. The hodl and buy the dip mentality this sub taught me is so fucking iron clad.
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:06:30

No need to sue them when they are hemorrhaging money from supporting all these failed shitcoin splits. I can't wait to see what's next after 2x. I'll take my free air dropped shitcoin any day from these retards and take a hot steamy dump on 2x for more BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:59:45
I agree. Dump usd

What kind of crack are you on? How are you so retarded? You know Bitcoin is programmable money right? I bet you are 100% unaware of all the things in the pipeline to add to Bitcoin. All these alts will be rendered useless as each gets implemented. You're argument for inefficient is completely invalid as we are watching lightning network roll out. I seriously can't even imagine what type of retarded as brain people much have to believe such garbage. The internet of money is literally being built before our eyes and you are here holding your hands over your eyes and ears. Lol. Good luck with your shitcoins you pleb. I'd say I'm sorry for speaking so harshly but I'm not, I'm just tired of reading comments of retards who will believe any bullshit they are fed without doing a lick of research.

For real, I feel like OP doesn't really know shit. OP makes it seem WAY worse than it really is and doesn't mention anything about all the good news a s major improvements, and how the 2nd layer is coming to life. I down voted the post. I agree we need to be aware of the price and hodl strong, but it comes back to not investing more than you are afraid to lose. These noobs will liquidate at a major loss, and then they will buy back in later for much less.

Nothing but posts from people who don't even frequent Bitcoin or crypto subs. This is even worse than the Bcash shit. Can we just get back to hating bcash, because all these nocoiners who just want to dick ride the USD are even worse than the bcashers. GTFO, why are you even posting in this sub? Why are you here? Clearly you are interested but just shit talk because you missed the fucking boat and will continue to miss it and live you miserable fucking life being consistently wrong. ��
@_date: 2018-07-09 02:58:03
Just buy it directly, there have been studies done...it's a waste of money. Buy Bitcoin, with the money you have for mining. Spread out your buys at different prices, eventually you will catch the bottom. Looking back last year when I got added to a mining project, the guy who funeded it spent $25k on mining equipment, sure we have made profits, but nearly as much if we had just bought the Bitcoin directly. Unless you can scale at a massive size, just buy it. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:23:43
FML, I only bought $500 during that dip at $7400 on gdax, was holding out to see if it would go futrher. Ugh, I could have dropped so much more. Oh well, dollar cost avg is best! Which is why I'd didn't go all in on that number!!
@_date: 2017-10-01 13:07:17
Ah. I though I read on here they finally added phone support. It's kind of a joke they don't have it. After all...old heads like my dad love phone support.

It's disgusting how they just don't give a fuck. Part of me thinks bcash was planned so no one took 2x seriously. All I can do is pop up as many full nodes as I can, and when I get my 3 S9s in end of November I'm only mining Bitcoin. We need more posts like this right now and less meme until this is settled. We need more action. Get those nodes up boys.

Nah it's cool. Maybe you just have a hate boner for Core. Also, let's talk about the major swings in block times in shitcoin cash. Lol the ego you guys have is remarkable. It's either 6 hours for one block, or 40 block per hour. Haha no one respects that shit. As a computer scientist it's actually quite funny. Someone on meth write these algorithms? Not keeping my hard earned money in a coin that has such horrible implementation and algorithms.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:14:47
I think at this point, it would be suicide for coinbase (or any company for that matter) to not break this agreement. I am finally getting around to verifying my tether account to purchase tether to buy BTC with it just in case coinbase (my only course of BTC using USD) stick with 2x. I would never use them again.
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:11:30
Yea, Im fully out of all alts now...for good or for bad. But there is no bad hodling Bitcoin. I try to come by realizing I've never lost USD...but it's hard when my main goal is to aquire as much BTC as possible. Their just goes to show trading isn't my things and I've been burned twice now from bitcoin showing us it's king time and time again. I will not be burned a 3rd time. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:55:19
ok well if you are looking to buy a decent amount, I would suggest looking into buying a hardware wallet like ledger nano s, or trezor. Right away though you could find a desktop wallet to use on your desktop PC to transfer there. ALWAYS make sure you have a recover method. People on this sub will be more than willing to help you transfer it to them. As for buying, right now I'm only using coinbase.com, but with the upcoming split, most of us hate them. I will be moving away from them and I'm not sure who to use yet. If you are looking to buy soon, coinbase.com for sure is the easiest. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:14:01

Before I state this I think it's clear I'm against 2x 100%...that being said, one could argue that if 2x succeeds that at least in the cyrpto space they have shown that an agreement can be kept. In reverse if it doesn't go through it shows that agreements down the road mean shit. So I think the best outcome would have to be 2x happening....and failing. 
To you're point, with fake news in social media and all the garbage that is spewed....its clear that shit works, especially for the simple minds who cant think for themselves and/or do any real research.

Lol. I'm a software engineer, it's just a bad time of the year to find a job. Spring should be much easier. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 04:25:48

This is the kind of advice im seeing all over this sub from idiots who have no idea whats going on. Ok cool, you can look at a chart and see it going down and inform people to sell because its going down, wow, you are so smart!
...but what you have no idea about is what is going on with bitcoin. You have no idea about segwit adoption climbing, you have no idea about the growth of the Lightning Network, you have no idea about all the GREAT news we have been reading in this sub for the past two weeks, you have no idea about what the United States is about to say (it looks like great news to me), you have no idea that the largest ATM manufacturer is working on pushing down updates to allow bitcoin to be bought at normal ATMs, you have no idea about ALL the development in Bitcoin NOR do you even understand why we are buying it. I'm not buying it to get rich, I'm buying it as an exit from the United State shit fiat paper money. I suggest you watch [these videos]( and then come back and tell me why I should sell a fucking satoshi.
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:13:24
All I see is inventory sitting around doing nothing. People cant make money if it just fucking sits there. Lol. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:19:47
He's kinda right, i expect coinbase's back end to be utter trash. I'm shocked they haven't been hacked yet.

Probably bought back at a loss. Never sell...the percentage of people who are actually good at trading is a very small number.

@_date: 2017-10-03 14:18:42
Sure ok. Blame me for the people who clearly want core to die over at r/btc. Yea great idea kiddo...and I'm the problem...
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:58:20
I bet the BCH community downstairs know what to think. I remember seeing some posts about people going all in on BCH. Poo schmucks, they are just the sheeple of crypto. I bet some go all in on 2x as well, and will get dumped on again. Then leave crypto forever and call it a ponsi.
@_date: 2018-07-23 03:36:14
Ello.....Damp it
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:44:58
Love this "sick of" post when OP has been in crypto for like 15 days. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:10:09
They can't. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 01:15:16
For me, if even one person backed out the agreement is off. I too do not want 2x, but I'm also torn because this sets a standard that agreements mean shit down the road. So I will be happy and both a bit scared if 2x doesn't happen. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:20:53
I had mine off exchanges, sucks I probably won't get to dump during the pump, but I prefer to be safe first. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:11:20
Says the guy that can't understand that Segwit is a block size increase...
@_date: 2017-10-29 00:17:33
I think you mean to call it corporation coin.

@_date: 2017-09-25 01:16:50
Yea this isnt what I want to associate with nor do I want Bitcoin to associate with. This paints a bad picture for bitcoin, especially to someone older in age. Ill stick with my I'm Hodling t-shirt, not this bullshit. Get a grip...

If you click on advanced you will see the Segwit2x option when you click to change blockchains. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:26:52
Yea, after bittrex handled that bcash so great I wish I had the balls to do this. Have too much to do it though, missed that $800 pump. Ugh that would have been awesome. BUT since Bitcoin could be worth so much in the future it's not worth the risk in my cash. Protecting my Bitcoin is the best route. I just need to find out what will happen using ledger. I know some wallets if you transfer it will go to the chain with the most hash power...so I don't want to be messing with that shit. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:10:26
Are you asking about 2x? I meant Im waiting to make sure if there are any bugs or issues with ledger's software after three split. Trezor had issues with the last split so I'm trying to minimize a situation where I lose my coins.

Blockchain is just a linked list ledger...nothing innovative there at all. These plebs don't even understand it's the decentralized network plus the Blockchain that makes it so disruptive. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:02:19
Lol OP in Bitcoin for a month and is such an expert on it after "reading about it for a couple hours". Lol God damn what times we live in. I've been in this shit since May and I wouldn't even dare to try to make such forecasts because I just don't know. Not that I don't know about Bitcoin, or how it works, I read about it every day and I'm reading Andreas Antonopoulos book on programming the Blockchain...even then I wouldn't sound this confident on it. Lol Sorry OP I have to laugh at you. You make great points and it is super easy to enter it for sure, but thaf doesn't mean in 3 years time frame it's taking over Gold in 3 years. Believe me I would LOVE for this to be true. Is have my retirement package complete...but let's chill the fuck out and make it to $10k - $20 first. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:23:14
Well this answers my question like a couple min before you posted this. I wonder how much bcash is about to be dumped. Lol. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:19:40
Thanks though. We need to make others know as well!
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:41:57
I'd be A ok with it dropping to $6k from a $15k ATH. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:22:54
I'm not rich or well off yet but if this thing moons I will be. Not looking to be mega rich I just want this as my early retirement package. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:18:12
This. Please. I'm still buying but not nearly as much as I want. I have some cocked andoaded for $3k. If we hit $3k again I would be shocked it would ever go that low again. Shit I honestly can't see it dropping below $4k right now. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:05:45
A group of children? Last I checked all other entities are resorting to paid shills, completely false tweets, and a whole boat load of bullshit. Why rush to make the block size so big? Why not implement segwit and go from there? I applaud core for not rushing...this is programmable money, it's not rushing to make a program or app. Just looked at bcash and we can see what rushed and half assed implementation looks like. I expect 2x to be the same, 2x had ONLY miner support and large corporation support....why on Earth would you even want to side with that in the world of Bitcoin? Its about consensus and if consensus isn't for larger blocks...we don't have larger blocks. Down the road....I see an increase needed...but I'm back to where I'm saying what's the rush?
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:03:33
True. Yea I know he prefers to be paid in Bitcoin. I hear him talk about the hassle of bank wires alot. Ew, who wants to deal with that bullshit?

@_date: 2017-09-24 14:33:21
I'm hodling because I believe in the technology. I'm not a sell out like you are, which means you are obviously in it for the money. And then also bragging about it...
Also why do you care if you are an ETH hodler? Obviously that's your coin and not Bitcoin. Enjoy your shit coin. Just an FYI, but anyone jumping in even today I consider an early adopter. YOU are the type of person that is a fucking shill, not me. You come off as someone who you are not and for what? To sound like you know a thing or two on the internet? Lol I love nothing more but poking holes through pseudo intellectuals like you.
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:53:53


More like, they fantasize. They "love the technology but not Bitcoin". These idiot banks or people who say this are just dumb. Blockchain is just a linked list UNLESS it's decentralized. So I have no clue what the banks would even do with this "tech" because ain't no way in hell they are going to just let anyone mine it, and it sure as hell won't be decentralized. Therefore their Blockchain will just be a linked list and centralized. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:49:26
It's confirmed, you get my downvote for bringing up the past news. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 01:07:24
Wouldn't this be stealing....they would be able to hold ALL I've everyone BTC and only give them 2x. I would think they would be prepared for this for and have both available day one. After all...they they want to stay in business and that would be suicide to ONLY give out 2x if your BTC is removed. This is why NONE of my BTC is on any echange. 
Edit: Don't they have phone support? Someone should call them. I don't have time. :) Actually...maybe I should make the time I get all my BTC from them. I would cry if I could only get 2x. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 04:05:24
Well we said we weren't going to say anything about him, until we did like a day later. Hmmm this sounds familiar. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 04:12:38
I get what you are saying, but I don't see how. If this price snowballs out of control, which it will, all the alts will be left in the dust. Also lets look at all the devs on current projects...alot of these alts will be a thing of the past, I see some devs contributing to Bitcoin once theirs has failed. Especially if they are passionate about this industry. Other crypto currencies are already in play and supposedly better, why haven't they dethroned Bitcoin? My main reason for this is infrastructure. Bitcoin has the infrastructure and nothing even matches it. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:20:49
So you expect the same result? Why? Its funny how many people think because something happened once it will happen again. People also think we will have an 80% crash because it happened last time. I just lol at it. Sure it could have an 80% crash, but it would take the USA banning Bitcoin to have it crash that much.

@_date: 2017-10-09 17:45:38
Nothing is locked up in an echcnage. Idk what that even means. Yea they get a better deal, but I'm betting on the fact that Bitcoin blows these alts out of the water...and I actually should have done this yesterday.  Bitcoin is he only coin I even care about. Lol
@_date: 2017-10-08 01:36:09
God this is sexy. Yes they are way overpriced but I would buy from one every week if I could.

@_date: 2017-10-13 04:10:15

@_date: 2017-10-26 14:12:19
No wonder why they would have to call the chain with the hardest difficulty Bitcoin. LOL
@_date: 2017-10-12 07:29:03
"we support where the hash power is"....how fucking dumb of them. That's not Bitcoin. Yes we need the miners and he hash power...but to follow them is the most retarded thing ever since they are driven by money, not principal and philosophy. And I don't blame them one bit for switching to bcash to mine 40 thousand gabillion bagillion blocks per hour. I would to if it was more profitable....it's called running a business. Doesn't me I'm going to consider bcash the coin to have. Lol
@_date: 2017-09-25 22:58:15

They can't fork me no more. I own my own money now ��
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:25:22
Yes that makes more sense. Implementing the fees in comparison to the block reward. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 05:29:29
Typical? I could say the same? I asked you to defend yourself and you replied with a fucking question. I'm not gonna even waste my time because clearly you have no argument to provide. Lol @ typical Jesus Christ some of you guys have your head so far up your asses. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:44:14
Correct, cut can't you see the capacity a block can hold? If it's 1mb it's Bitcoin, if it's 2mb it's 2x
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:18:04

Amen to this man. My company has been making awful decisions since I've been in it. Not surprised one bit at these companies just acting like companies that sucks at being companies. Seriously I know about people high up at tech firms who have their history degrees and not a shred of technical knowledge making important decisions that is just crippling us. Humans are awful at rational decision making. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 04:28:18

OP only makes new threads and no comments...shocker the links is from bitcoin.com. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:06:06
You'd be surprised at how well people do take care of their own money. You are your own banker. The first thing I did was buy a ledger nano s to store mine. I feel safe as shit right now...but that could even change down the road and I will adapt. Yea I've seen posts on here if people losing 95 bitcoins because they had that shit on an exchange...but my god those kind of people obviously shouldn't have that much. How could you have that much and not take the time to secure your shit and move it to cold storage? Overall...I see even noobs being super good with their own money. Now if we could just get people to stop clicking links in their emails...
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:52:11

@_date: 2017-10-19 05:25:57
Be happy with what you have. I would also hate it if I had to sell mine as well. Hopefully it keeps going up so you can extract less when needed. I would love to be part of the 10 club. Chin up fella
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:09:37
Lol true. Im not sure why I even asked. Plus in this sub all alts are shitcoins...and I've sold way too late. Got caught with my pants down. Sold and even lost some and I'll never look back. I only hodl Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:18:49
Bitcoin is dead!
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:22:24
I don't want 2x to succeed, but if miners leave BTC to mine bcash during the fork...2x could potentially be have the harder difficulty. It would have to be for an extended period of time. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:49:48
Been buying since $1800 and I'm trying to convince my wife to go all in with our savings! Then build back up in USD just to make her happy.

So in 2 years....no.
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:42:17
Oh for sure, I can't wait for my free 2x....also another reason to cash out your alts to get more air dropped shitcoin to sell for BTC. I made a good amount off of BCH, and I will be very thankful to dump 2x as well for more!
@_date: 2017-10-29 04:45:29
Great purchase. My brother in law has one. If you want, I can 3d print the cup holder you can stick in the side of it for you. Just pay shipping. Pm me.  
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:48:29
Sure I agree....but that's for someone who has the time to watch charts and make sells at the drop of a hat. That's not me and I know for a fact that a vast majority of traders just suck....myself included. I'm fine only buying my BTC from here on out and never losing any again. I've never gained from alts because I never could sell when it was high....on multiple occasions. So yea, hodling and buying the dip is why this community uses this motto....it's the safest way to buy up as much BTC as one can. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 03:59:17
Lol I love Richard. The guy is so smart and has such clear thoughts that make me go "no shit why didn't I think of that?"  He's very bullish on it, idk how accurate his call is but I sure would enjoy $20k Bitcoin! I would also love a $10k "crash" then as well, hell let's go back down to $5k from there and buy more! Haha I'm so deep in this shit I want more! (I'm also going with no kids and can risk)
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:01:13

@_date: 2017-10-19 05:04:49
I've invested too much...no drop make me nervous. Go ahead and tell me that's bad too. Don't care I want as much BTC as I can possibly have. Buying more soon. We in here before wall street boys. Wish I would have been buying more all summer.
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:37:18
I'm getting shit on in the alts subs like NEO for saying I sold my alts before the dip and they are ridiculing me for selling low. Lol those alts are about to be much much lower. Done with alts. Never lose BTC again. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:40:03
Lolol for real, this is me exactly. I'll never own another alt again and I'm glad I dumped right before the latest boom. My God bitcoin is about to leave them in the dust again. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:22:49
All you did was validate you don't understand what you are talking about nor do you probably care to actually educate yourself. All I did was preset facts, technicals, and the philosophy behind bitcoin.
Edit: You seem newer to Bitcoin, or are just uninformed. I'd maybe stop going around being the "Reality crusher" you are and read up on how Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:11:25

Not my fault you have such a simple mind. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:31:58
Yea because math and TA are super accurate in crypto. Lol you new?

@_date: 2017-10-16 01:33:15
True, but when it does run out in 21xx fees would have to be implemented. I see what you're saying but I would be against something that. Mining needs incentive and the harder it becomes the more Centralized it could become as well.

@_date: 2018-07-22 00:55:40
Idk about you but I don't care if they are Dem or repub, if they embrace Bitcoin it's a fucking plus. Honestly, I absolutely hate crypto and politics. I can't stand when people on crypto Twitter talk about politics. There is a reason why I don't use Facebook anymore...it's politics. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 17:48:30
I certainly didn't. It's just funny because they increased the size for no real reason. Lol

I'm passionate about this shit and I don't take the shills from r/btc lightly. Sure I'm not a great representative for it on the internet but in a day where everyone is a pseudo intellectual that just want to teach you about shit they know nothing about....I tend to be more blunt. People don't like that. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 22:37:50
You're really not getting my very simple argument. I'll spell it out for you again - It doesn't bode well for Bitcoin for someone who sees this shirt and is unaware of the original art work. People form opinions instantly...that's just how it is and to ignore that is retarded. Shit I flew my drone at the beach months ago and I overheard some lady saying "I though those were illegal". People are dumb. That's just the way it is. So yes, someone older who is unaware of this art and sees this shirt will automatically make a judgment call about Bitcoin and not want to associate with it at all. Shit, my buddy was about to be all in on Bitcoin since I've been talking to him about it and how wife read an article about Bitcoin and the word "China" was in the article...the guy did a complete 180 and is 100% against Bitcoin and "will never touch it with a ten foot poll". It is what it is. I like the shirt, it looks cool, but you can't blame anyone for their mind going directly to that conclusion with the current state of affairs. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 16:57:11
To make the claim that a multi year bear market still isn't possible, is just as dumb as saying there will be one. We are not out of the woods by any means and the trend is still....down.

Miners are supposed to be greedy, they need to make money. That being said, I believe they aren't dumb and I would be shocked to see majority hash power on 2x, even miners are probably aware of how cancerous 2x is....so I hope. The market will decide that's for sure, and when the price can't keep up with Bitcoin, they will switch back. This will happen until it's dead. Bcash becomes more profitable to mine now and miners still don't switch. Sure some do, but not like in the begining. They know it's dead.

@_date: 2017-10-15 18:29:53
Lol. All I had to do was look at the eth chart and see that for it to get back to .15 BTC it needed to be worth over $850. So if someone held ETH all year long they have actually made less in terms of BTC depending on when they bought. I was trying to be a hodler of NEO and OMG...I'll never hodl any coin other than BTC now. Next time a make any profits I'm taking them. Hodling alts is retarded.

Coinbase will give you both you BTC and BTC2X. BUT I don't suggest keeping your private keys on an exhnage... especially coinbase. You will want to research as to what kind of wallet you will want to use. I have a ledger so I'm not knowledgeable on a good desktop wallet for Bitcoin. Do your research and DEFINITELY make sure you have a backup if you wallet.

I wouldn't be shocked to people sell the news in Nov for bitcoin, meanwhile 2x will be shit, everything will dip and we will get some very very cheap alts. But then again if everyone is doing it idk how you able money. Makes sense to just hold and have some money ready for that dip.

@_date: 2017-10-25 03:07:21
Hold up...they are conflicting in their statements. They mention they will let the market decide but yet they say that they will chose the chain with the most difficulty as the chain that IS Bitcoin. Those are not the same fucking thing. The amount of miners mining a coin is not the market. They are two separate things. Sure the market will decide which is more valuable....but that doesn't mean they will mine it. Shit look at bcash, miners have no issue mining it to make a buck and then switch back. So we should see it oscillate I would think. Lol is coinbase going to oscillate the names of each chain? Lol what the fuck they are so unbelievably retarded. If anything this just proves big companies should not dictate Bitcoin as they simply don't understand it. We want to avoid corporations...not be pals with them. Any of these big blockers need to go home and go to bed...I'll just assume they are the same type of people who would value safety over freedom.

I think thier logic behind it is they don't need replay protection because ethey will be THE Bitcoin. Having replay protection makes them an alt coin right away. I absolutely am against and hate 2x, but it makes sense. It's caceeoous though for us. I know for sure I'm not rushing to dump mine because I'm making sure my REAL Bitcoin is safe. I have a ledger but I'm going to wait a while before dumping it...play it safe guys.

Which gpu's? We use a mix of GTX 1070s and 1080ti's. We had a bitch of the time getting the 1070s in this current market. Luckily we got some at like $400. It's becoming increasingly hard for the GPU's though, even for mining the shitcoins and getting paid in Bitcoin. This is why we are phasing out our shit for ASIC miners. Seeing as you dont pay electric, lets just say this, you will profit a TON. If you are renting or something, they will notice. Our electric bill is around $500 - $650 and we are still trying to cut down on that. We are learning as we go and now we are trying to cool the room better. If we have full ASICs cooling would be easier to maintain considering you could just pipe the exhaust out the window. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:06:49

True, unless I broke it and I needed to transfer at that moment. Then a backup device is needed. Also, I meant I wanted to get a safe to protect myself. Right now of course most would not know what the hell to do with my ledger, years from now that won't be the case. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:46:38
I think the OP is just trying to calmn some nerves about dips and how effective hodling is. It would be dumb to say hodling doesn't work up until now. Sure there could be a major crash soon, we don't know...but looking at the chart it looks to have always worked. Sure it's risky but this is why I always hodl and buy the dip and I always will until I'm proven otherwise. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:11:39
No, ledger is just your wallet. Look at it as your wallet in your back pocket that holds cash. Coinbase is like the bank (fuck banks) you go to get the Bitcoin. You buy the bitcoin and then send it to your wallet for safe keeping. The ledger nano also has a 24 phrase backup you can use if you ever lose it. And what is cool is you can recover your ledger nano wallet in electrum if ever you lost or damaged your ledger. That way it's still accessible if it's damaged. Just note, you lose your nano AND lose your 24 word phase, it's gone forever. It's amazing how well people are able to protect and keep their money safe when it's up to them. I applaud you for learning and hoenslty I don't believe any amount is too small to hold in a ledger nano, anything more than the cost of the ledger nano calls for holding it properly. Especially when it could be worth so much more in the near future. Also, I wish I would have taken this advice and I can't be more serious...don't even try to dabble in any alts. Luckily I haven't lost any BTC but that's a sure fire way to do so. Sure some are good but it's risky and I've learned overtime it's not worth the risk of losing BTC. Especially when it could be worth so much in the future. Trading isn't easy and there is only a very small percentage of people that can actually do it well.

Uh...because there is only one Bitcoin. Lol. As for fees and transaction times, all Bitcoin is right now is a store of value. Also, this whole transaction time thing is kind of bullshit considering if a transaction is correctly formed it will show up in your wallet instantaneously without any confirmations. That's enough today to know that the payment was received. Obviously for larger purchases that wouldn't be ok. People keep looking at Bitcoin as it needs to have Lower fees and quicker transaction times, why? When 2x drops I expect the transaction times of Bitcoin to go about 100 minutes per confirmation...it's a store of value so who the hell cares? These plebs who look at Bitcoin like something it isn't yet just show how uniformed you really are.

Haha I was looking at used lambos yesterday because it actually looks like it could be possible for me know. I would need million dollar Bitcoin prices to get this though, I'm more looking at $75k -  used lambos and Ferrari

I mean this is just on situation you describe. I'd much rather have my money in Bitcoin...they can't take it. Yes they will take anything they fucking want...that's my point. They can't take the 24 words out if your head

@_date: 2018-07-09 03:03:10
You're all over the fucking place. Your title makes it seem like Bitcoin is slow, your post is blaming exchanges for "crypto when are you gonna get your shit together". Seems like you have a problem at forming any sort of logic or real idea. Sure sending $ to coinbase is slow, it's using the Fiat system. PayPal is instant but that doesn't mean that shit is settled, this is why they have gone the bank wire route. If you buy Bitcoin with $, they want to know 100% they got your $. This is a Fiat and exchange issue, not a "crypto" issue you scrub.

@_date: 2017-10-14 20:05:29
You have to understand that we have already been through this, and there has been a post just like the OP,  but of course the beast eqsd poked again bu him, not us. So yea, you're asking a bunch of people not to respond to the guy we hate most after he said he was done taking about Bitcoin and not even 24 hours after that he is back at it again. I for one am loving all the Jamie hate, I hate him and he's the perfect example of what we are up against. The next thing we will here is how Bitcoin is used for terrorists and they will want to ban it. That's how these governments will pitch it. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 04:09:51
I will be doing this. I for one can't wait to start adding bitcoin to my 401k portfolio. As is...i dont feel like I will have very much from my 401k when i retire, i would love to mitigate this buy using bitcoin. fuck, it would be hard to not use the full % for it. I WANT THIS SO BAD.
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:03:05
Not sick of it yet even though I know we will go higher. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:08:31
Oh cool, they have backing from the miners....who are 100% money driven. That is not Bitcoin...following the miners and hash power, if it was, what the fuck are we all doing here anyway? Go invest in shit Fiat. No they do not have the deveopers, that is a lie and you know it. If there is such an outcry for 2x as you make it seem, why is it that I only see a vast majority against it? Mining pools and exchanges are coming out left and right saying they are not for the NYA. It's not a contentious fork if the users and nodes are blatantly against it, after all it is the nodes that validate the blocks, not the miners.
You make some pretty wild statements and just cook shit up out of thin air. To say people who just bought into the last couple months are not hardcore bitcoiners might just be the most idiotic thing I've read on this sub, and I've read alot of stupid shit. Lol how does anyone even begin to say that with any shred of decency or any evidence? There is no way to scientifically prove or even begin to prove that statement could be true. Which just explains how you clearly don't understand what Bitcoin is and what a contentious agreement would actually look like, and the NYA isn't one. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 04:33:05
For the love of all that is holy, if I owned 95 Bitcoins they would be NO WHERE near a machine that had TeamViewer on it. Holy shit I'm just shocked how wreckless people are. Lol. I don't own even a percentage of that and I have a ledger. That fucker is never open unless I'm looking at my screen, plus it times out pretty fast. Wow dude. Sorry for your lost but I can't believe that. Luckily for you Bitcoin is still "cheap". Everyone says how early we are, and I'm sure you will have more of an emphasis on security now. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:19:22

Maybe you'll get a chance at cheaper Bitcoin. That's how I see it. OP is right about alot, but I don't think we are looking at a 90% correction like it has seen before. The whole world is aware of Bitcoin now and even the sniff of $3k, $5k, or $7500 Bitcoin I would think this could put the bottom. Of course I could be dead wrong, but idk, the OP kinda made it seem worse than it really is. I've seen nothing but good news lately and bitcoins 2nd layer is what will propel us to the next level. I can't wait to see the banks completely disrupted. Sure they can try to ban it, but they will fail. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 02:37:38
There were some real assholes on this sub saying only black market and criminals use Bitcoin in Venezuela, thanks for setting the record straight. I ahge a friend who lives down there and it sounds like the people who are eating we're the ones smart enough to get into Bitcoin last year. I'm so sorry such a wonderful country is being trashed, and I'm glad you are trying to help others. We need more people like you in this world. Wish you the best!

True. But I'm already kind of checked out with trying to hodl alts. I don't trust them. The safest thing to do (for me) is to hodl Bitcoin and nothing else. You don't lose it if you don't trade it. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:19:42


ETH is shitcoin like the rest of them. It would have to be over $800 to reach it's high in comparison to BTC. Let's not forget about how it's not decentralized.
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:34:13
$6k is our new support now boys (once we go way higher). No fucking clue, I'm just saying it. Lol. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:19:29
Unless coinbase changes it will be irrelevant down the road. For you to claim high fees based on the high fees coinbases charges...is the exact reason why I have been as blunt as I am. Blaming Bitcoin for the high fees when you are willing chosing to either use coinbase or cherry pick them as an example (without explaining it) you are part of the problem not the solution. I've also dealt with coinbase for buying and it's sucked removing my Bitcoin and paying that high fee...but I'm not a brain dead enough to parade around Reddit and claiming the fees are high because im not an incompetent peice of shit. You look dumb making such stupid claims when people are sending transactions through with 1 sat/byte in fees and a little thing called lightning network that literally can result in negative fees. Stop your bullshit.

Lol all it does is further confusion for people who are trying to buy and don't know anything. When they sign up they will be created with 3 different bitcoins. Lol my god. It will die and so will 2x (hopefully) and when they do decide to remove the two alt coins after dealing with so many confused noobs...they will pull them and that shit will drop do damn hard.

@_date: 2017-10-24 01:49:34
I think coinbase wised up and knew this was suicide. I will continue to use them....for now. 
Edit: They are as dumb as a bag of dicks. I guess they are clarifying their statement and now they say the chain with the hardest difficulty is Bitcoin. Idk how the fuck you can be so dumb. What if the difficulty changes? Do you change the name again? Lol this is going to be a mess...all these exchanges are doing it differently and to be honest, I might just keep buying until the fork just to ensure I get what I know is the real Bitcoin. Lol fuck coinbase again. I'm done. I'm out. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:25:48
Lol just wait until the rest of us dump....the market will be flooded. I really would love to get a chance to dump at this price. My goodness it would be a glorious return.

@_date: 2017-10-30 03:17:47
The idealogoy behind not having replay protection is if they do have replay protection then obviously they aren't THE Bitcoin. I wish they did have it, it would totally be dead on arrival. All this "it's dead" talk is dangerous, 2x is not dead and the miner support has gone up to ~94%. Will be interesting to see if they will actually mine it.

@_date: 2017-10-13 14:30:22
I am being cocky, because look at ETH  on coinmarketcap since I jumped in to crypto in May. It's price hasnt moved very much but bitcoins price has. Therefore ETH is worth alot less Bitcoin as time goes on. ETH is a shitcoin just as much as the rest of them are. I don't care about their fundamentals because some of them are really good, like NEO. I was able to see that Bitcoin will leave most of these alts in the dust, and this past week was a reminder. This happened before during the last boom a couple months ago and some of those alts still never reached the same in their BTC value. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:01:39

Lol my god, if you honestly think a government official of that High rank using a personal email on a private server with ZERO encryption is considered "didn't do anything wrong", I cannot help you. It's not a very hard concept not is it hard to understand the gravity of the situation.

I tend to think the value of Bitcoin is what we say it is, is bitcoins biggest strength. The United States government just prints money out their ass, we have no control over that. So to talk about it like it's only worth what people pay for it, ah yea...that's called the free market and I absolutely love it because no bank or government has any say in the matter. Power to the people of the world in it's most literal sense. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:02:02
I do know that S2X won't replace it....look at all the exchanges they are not listing it as BTC. It's gonna be DOA. Look at what it's trading for on Bitfinex. Mining pools are pulling out, it's not contentious. The vast majority are against it. It's a hostile takeover from the big companies and they tried, and failed. Knowledge is power, stop believing the bullshit you are fed and use common sense and logic and you will not lose.

Wrong, Im in Bitcoin BECAUSE it's not government backed. Therefore I have ALL the freedom to do with it as I please. No one can take it from me, and now one knows how much I have. That is freedom. Shit, I can destroy my wallet and still recover it with 24 words, walking around with all my money in my head and no one will know. If that isn't freedom to you, idk why I keep wasting my time responding. Bitcoin is going to tear these banks apart because we no longer need them. Costs nothing to enter, and no one is prevented from using it. It's the money for the people literally from the people. You clealry can't even grasp this, you need to watch Andreas Antonopoulos on youtube. I'm sorry this experiment is too complicated for youre simple ass mind, but I tend to think you just don't know anything because you ahbrnt bothered to even try to understand it. Anything else?

@_date: 2018-04-29 04:42:39
I argue that Bitcoin not being backed by a government is it's biggest strength. This makes it more valuable to me knowing know government will ever inflate it or currupt it. I have made a decision as an adult to put my money into a system that isn't having money just created out of thin air.

I see no difference in the sense that if I pay you cash for something, it's gone and out of my hands. No way to revert. Same with bitcoin. I was speaking towards that. Either I'm explaining shit poorly, or everyone is just picking out words and making into something it isn't.

Bitcoin is recoverable in the sense if I lost my hardware wallet. Sure if I send it somewhere in a transaction it's gone...so is cash. There is no difference there. Don't send your money to places you don't trust. I don't see how this is any different than using non-bitcoin. It's kind of a stupid argment. I was speaking towards stealing/losing your own money.

Lol @ you're eth comment. Ok guy. ETH just passed 1TB to set up a full node, eth is a shit show, it's a pipe dream to think it will be worth anything other than creating ICOs. Utility my ass, none of these shit coins have been used for a good damn thing, including smart contracts. No one has any reason to use a smart contract...oh and that will be a layer on top of Bitcoin as well. What the simple minds can't understand is that this is programmable money and using a layered approach, ANYTHING is possible. This is what Andreas calls it "Internet of money" being built...and it's being built around Bitcoin. Lol ETH. Gtfo of here with that trash. Lemme know when you have your eth node up and running in never years. 
Edit: also, I forgot to mention your thoughts about LN being Centralized, ah no. LN is a protol, not a coin. Lol. Is TCP/IP centralized? Also, how are you going to even bring up centralization and then mention shit about ETH having a better use case. Man people are confused.

You NEARLY sold but you didn't. And that is a risky game to get into. I've seen all too often people selling at that they thought was the top and they end up with less BTC. I try to learn from others mistakes, and I will not make that mistake. I lost some BTC dabbling in alts, I will not make that mistake again. You don't know me and you don't know shit, yes I think it will go up and that's based on what I know. I know wall street is going to start trading it and I also know that a vast majority of the community is against Bitcoin. Of course it will come down, I just don't think so now. I also have no clue, and neither do you. Good traders are rare, I'm not one of them. I also know there is no good time to buy so I just buy. I've waited for dips and they never came. Waiting for a dip can be just as bad as selling low, just buy some at what you feel is a reasonable price. I bought more at $5300 and if it dips lower than that fine, I didn't hesitate to buy previously and I'm up a great deal because of it, which gives me more balls to hodl through a major dip.

Pretty ironic when Bitcoin went from $1800 (when I bought it) to $8k(the price now. In case you were unaware since you said $7k to fit your narritve more). Lol I remember thinking people were nuts for calling for $4k. You're argument is a dumb one.

I think it's criminal we have to pay taxes on money earned from stocks, mutual funds, Bitcoin, you name it. Sure there needs to be taxes, else, how does a government work? But our government has become so fucking bloated we have to pay taxes on just about everything. It's time things change. The government can function on much less with only the government programs that are necessary to run. I can only hope Bitcoin is so disruptive it changes the banks and our governments.

1) don't use an online wallet, its better just to burn your money. You'll lose it. But if you need to keep it online, coinbase is probably the most secure, even though I ahte them, it's true. Enable Google authenticator is a MUST. 
2) to send on the Blockchain it's about ~30 minutes as I think coinbase needs 3 confirmations.
3) the fees on coinbase are percentage based. Google it, you'll find the amount. 
4) selling and transferring to your bank account is 3-5 days.

I think you're wrong here. Me being a patriot doesn't mean I'm advocating or even wanting to stand with the United States government. I do not feel less patriotic because I just don't even coorelate being patriotic with my government. I think you need to reword this post. I hate the United States government, but I love my country to death. They can't do anything correctly and it's corrupt as shit. So I would argue I'm MORE of a Patriot by owning Bitcoin which allows me more freedom and more ways to funnel that money into local businesses/people. If I ever got rich off a Bitcoin, I would totally quit my job and volunteer part time. That's how I was raised, to give a shit about other people and help those in need. I am more of a patriot owning Bitcoin and if you say otherwise, you are confused.

Its like you want humanity to fail. Bitcoin is the worlds greatest global project and for the first time in centuries, my money is my money....but you'd rather the paper from our government that is printed daily. Lol.

Anyone who is listening to him and following him for when to buy or not buy....is a jackass and deserves to lose their money. His  goal is for teaching charting. Me myself, I watch him for entertainment and I view his calls as sort of like watching the weatherman. It's a gauge as for what can happen. Shit, we could go to $10k and take a major dump.

Well I'm here to tell you that everyone who is on this sub who is in Bitcoin NOT to get rich quick, has the same values and opinions as me, and my opinion is fuck banks. Why do we coin the term banking the unbankable? Because there ARE people who can't use banks. Idk where you're from, but it sounds like you aren't able to think past your small sample size. All to often I see people on this sub taking about how this banks accounts get closed. And let's not forget about other countries where the goveenments are so poorly ran they steal from the savers and take a percentage. And let's not forget about hyper inflation. Dude you need to read up on what Bitcoin actually is or get the fuck off this sub. You're wasting your time and mine.

He does have Bitcoin...which is why he and his family. Luckily he is able to mine Bitcoin at work, else he would be in alot of trouble. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 14:18:11
Idk who is worse, the mega altcoiner, or the nocoiners. Both of them are equally annoying. My co worker was almost having an orgasm as Bitcoin was coming down from $19k. I asked him politely why he took so much joy in me and others losing money while in front of others, he felt like an ass. People don't understand I'm not in this to get rich quick, I'm in this for financial freedom from fiat. This is bitcoins strongest asset, and the main reason why I'm completely drawn to it. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 03:35:57
I'm not cashing out. I will keep it until I can use it in my everyday life. Its already becoming more of a reality and I do use it weekly to pay for things. I'm sorry you got burnt and took out a loan to buy Bitcoin, no one here would have ever suggested such a stupid idea. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:08:38
I don't know who is. Nore could I answer such a stupid question. Am I supposed to know who the people are selling/buying in America too? Lol you're just trying so hard to prove me wrong because somehow you think you know better. Check out the stats, it's fucking chaos down there. Go try to teach someone else a lesson. I linked the local Bitcoin stats below, the volume is sky rocketing. But it must be all false since I don't know the exact use case for someone to "take the useless currency".

Sure. I bought the pump at $1500, I bought the pump at $2500, I bought the pump at $4400, I could go on. I'll buy it all the way down. I buy it all the way up. You should try it. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 23:12:08

Not that they will have no choice, but eventually they will want it as we do now. Proving it's anti fragility and great store of value, even dumb dumbs can figure it out. For now, only we can see it.

Yea, the people who sold for .4 on gdax were a select few. You couldn't even transfer shitcoin cash in when they did that. It's just a sign of the fuckery that goes on with bcash...and now they are burning coins to make the price go up. Lol I seriously can't even imagine a mindset that agrees with all this fuckery....let alone the 32mb block size increase they are hard forking. Great idea guys, make the blocks larger when no one uses it. If these poor bcashers can't see it's made to be a corporate coin, they are lost forever.

I will also argue that I do not need FDIC guarantee... because my offline coins will not be stolen. You're physically unable to even comprehend what's going on here aren't you? ITS NOT NEEDED ANYMORE. The only people getting their shit stolen are the idiots who store their shit online. Not your keys not your coin. I would NVER store my bitcoins in a crypto bank and I'm sure a majority of people in this industry would agree.

I stopped even my DCA. it's clear it was going lower. Now I'm not so sure. I'm on hold for the moment but I have alot ready to buy. $4k is my first large amount to buy. If we see $2k, my wife won't be able to stop me from wiping my savings. I should note I have a very secure job that pays well. I know what I'm doing is stupid, but I want all the Bitcoin I can get. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 03:37:18
Do you have a Bitcoin wallet to send it too? If so, which one? I would suggest a hardware wallet, or desktop, never an online wallet. If you plan on using an online wallet, just keep it in the cash app. Anything over $1k, I'd suggest buying a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 12:14:30
No no no no no. Just no. We aren't a shitcoin. We do not need to advertise. If we have to advertise to survive, Bitcoin has failed. Stop this bullshit. Drop your shitcoin mentality, this is a decentralized currency, not a centralized shitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:36:55
The shit you spew about lower transactions is just awful. It's like no one remembered when coinbase went down the mem pool cleared immediately. So coinbase implemented segwit AND batching transactions. All of a sudden the mem pool clears...ironic?

Lol I just don't get it. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:33:27
We did increase the block size. Segwit allows for 4mb blocks since the blocks go by wieght now. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 02:54:26
1 - Bitcoin is near free, it can be free to send with LN.
2 - LN make any "fast" alts obsolete. 
3 - And most important, it's completely decentralized and has the only devs worth a damn on the project. 
I could go on.

But their wouldnt be limits like hitbtc has enforced. Also, a decentralized exchange would not be anything like a centralized one. Ever hear of hot swaps? Decentralized exchanges will be the norm down the road while centralized ones days are numbered.

It's glorious knowing money has been wasted like this. In fact, clearly nothing they have done has done a single fucking thing. All of this effort wasted. Roger scumbag Ver gets mega rich off Bitcoin and what does he do? Spends all his time and money on shilling a scam coin as Bitcoin, when he could be donating, volunteering, and adding so much other kind of value to the world. This is why I'm convinced eventually he will go away. A fool and his money will part ways. He's a fool. I have never hated anyone more.

Wow. I'm always shocked at the people who just don't give a fuck your money isn't your money. I can't wait for dumbasses like you to get fucking rekt by hyper inflation and corruption. Your thick head and unwillingness to understand what is actually going on will be your down fall and I will not empathize at all for you. You will never understand why people want Bitcoin with the mindset you have. I bet you think that you're money is insured as well if your bank went under. Lol. One thing is for sure, Bitcoin will go up and down in price forever (mostly up), your shit fiat will just get inflated to hell and go down forever. I'm glad I have half a brain to realize this. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 13:41:06
Not here to Bragg, I was giving perspective. All people see is the downfall when in reality the climb from where it was to where it is now is pretty spectacular. I will say this, I can't wait for it to be $20k again and all these bears feel shit for not buying now.

I hope it does drop more. I want more. Sure it will hurt, but I'm already dead set on not selling. So for me, getting down to the $2k range would be just A ok with with me. Even a 2 years of not much action would be great as well. Hell, I might even be able to join the 21 club. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 14:57:28
Only reason I haven't sold any. Actually if I'm being honest that's been my scapegoat for people who don't understand what I'm doing. I'm hodling it until I can use it as my only currency. Lol. I still use it alot, every chance I get. I just replace it.

You're correct. The ideal situation is to buy the dip. I'm just awful at it, and I'm not going to sit here and say I do it every time. It was much easier to do it in the bull market. I was holding out from buying with my larger stash for more downside. I haven't stopped buying every paycheck with the set amount I buy, which is what ever $300 will buy me. I agree, I explained that like a turd. The hodl and buy the dip method DOES work and it HAS worked since I entered last spring. If I did not follow this methodology I would have gotten  I bought the pump simply because there could be a chance &lt;$6k will never happen again. If it goes to $5k, or lower, I'm still buying.

My buddy lives in Venezuela and it's a shit show down there. Horrible tyrannical government which hyperinflation, and yet Bitcoin is being used in many places. It's becoming widley ised down there. He mines it at work and he's been feeding his family by using it for lunch and dinner. I can't speak to all locations, but in situations like that, internet connectivity is still available, even mobile. That's just one place so like I said, I can't comment on other places because I simply do not know.

The plebs in this sub who say hodling isnt the way to go anymore...haven't been here long and they will get rekt. I'm sorry you got rekt and you arent one of these people. You're intentions were right. I won't feel confident that we aren't going lower untik we are above $9k again however, so either buy back now, deal with the lose, OR wait and see. If you buy back now, have it in mind that it could go lower, and stick to your guns, else you will rinse repeat this until you have nothing left. I remember a guy who made a post saying he was a great trader and lost all 200 of his bitcoins. Clearly in a bull market everyone's a good trader. Lol

Wellllll, it does decrease. To be technically correct, his Bitcoin value doesn't go down or up unless he sells Bitcoin or buys it. 1 BTC == 1 BTC. 1 USD == 1 USD. I'd argue that Bitcoin is increasing while the USD is decreasing.

Yes. I pull put my phone and my phone wallet app scans the QR code and sends it. I did this purchasing something yesterday (online, but it works the same in person). I also have proof if the transaction through the Blockchain, and it's beyond easy to look up. And I didn't even use lightning. Using lightning it's done even faster. If already available on some retailers, and I don't have to touch any nasty money and make sure I got the correct amount in change back. So please tell me how using my phone to pay is easier than cash. It isn't. Sure we have things like apple and Android pay, and this is just as convenient.

The price of beer while at the pub doubles in the middle of your night...and I could go on. My buddy is living off of Bitcoin.

I still tell people, last year was the best time to buy, the next best time is now. I read that on this sub early last year. It still applies today as it did then.
Also, as a hodler, doesn't matter what the price is. I'm always buying. Hodl!
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:36:54
No he doesn't...a bank can be compromised easier than someone who wants the crypto in my head....which they don't even know is there unless I tell them. To think something is more secure in a bank is just ludacris. The same banks closing people's account and going down for hours. Gtfo. If you believe a bank is a great place to store your money, why are you even on this sub?
What are you talking about? This currency is redundant. Go ahead and steal my trezor or ledger, it's worthless to you since you don't know the password to get it, let alone it nukes itself after 3 failed attempts. However steal cash or gold from me, it's gone forever...so you can see why one situation needs a bank and the other doesn't. I won't even entertain an argument about people losing their Bitcoin stored online, that's just asking to get it stolen. 
TL;DR - Bitcoin IS recoverable and secure if correct steps are taken, cash and gold isn't. Therefore no need for banks.

See that's all it is to you. To me it's a technology that liberates me and my family. Its MY money and no one knows how much I have unless I tell them. Shit I can destroy my wallet and as long as I remember 24 words I can walk around with as much money as I have in my head and no one will no. THIS is why I'm in Bitcoin. THIS is why I continue to buy it. And THIS clearly isn't why you are in Bitcoin. You should just unsub. You provide zero value to this sub. But hey, you're welcome to stay....maybe one day you'll actually understand what it is we are trying to do here. Watch Andreas Antonopoulos on YouTube.

I've been here almost a year now....and I can't believe the people who still get rekt by keeping thier shit on an exchange. The day traders, sure I get it. And it sucks you have to do that....but with the transfers being so cheap, even for layer 1 Bitcoin transfer, I think it's irresponsible to not send your bitcoins to your hardware wallet when signing off for the night. When exchanges finally implement LN it will be even more irresponsible to keep on an exchange

Did it last year. Will do it this year. Are you that stupid to believe that dollar cost average isn't the best option for a hodler? Jesus Christ. Why are people like this even on this sub? Lol please enlighten me as to how else to chatch the bottom? I work full time. Don't know charting. Have a life. Dollar cost average is this subs MAIN financial advice and it works. It's simple and it allows me to gain as much BTC as possible. I doubt you are even here for the technology. Yes. Buy all the way down. Buy some at $8k, some at $7k, some at $6k and so on. This is how you aquire as much BTC as possible while having a full time job. Please oh please enlighten me why this entire sub has been wrong. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:36:41
I bought Bitcoin. It's worth the same amount in Bitcoin today as it will always be. The USD value just allows me to buy more the lower it is. Sure I bought the pump, and that's what I always do. Im a fomo. This is why I hodl. If I traded I'd be broke already. This sub taught me how to hodl and that's the ONLY sure fire way to never lose the amount of Bitcoin I own. I live this sub so much. If it wasn't for this sub, I was going to invest all my money into mining back in may 2017, instead I bought as a recommendation from some random on this sub. I am very VERY greatful for that person. I should take the time to go find him. This is why I don't care about the price. If it drops more, I have more money ready to buy lower. Like everyone else (since the volume spiked dramatically, I was waiting for the price to moved).

Ah, last I checked people rely on wallets for cash right? So replace the word cash in your post and see how it sounds. 
Plus, Bitcoin can be used on you phone wallet and paid like you do with your phone now, but it's instant. Coinbase is just an exchange to buy it from. I don't keep any bitocin there. I buy and move to my ahrdware wallet. 
In fact it's better than cash, cash isn't redundant, Bitcoin can't be printed out, put on your phone, put on a hardware wallet, and more. You can literally destroy your wallet and as long as you can remember 24 words...you can recover it. Try to walk around with millions of dollars on yourself with anything else in this world...you can't. You can literally walk around with those 24 words in your brain and never tell a soul and they will never know. That's what I signed up for.

There are other things ways to back up your seed and be safe about it. You're just cherry picking things, and it's such a cowardly way to win your argument. Sure, I could bump my head and forget the password to log into the hardware wallet completely as well...but being your own bank means you have taken the correct steps to secure your funds using multiple wallets, diversifying your allocations, having my wife educated on how to use it, etc. And NO hackers will not be able to steal my funds from my hardware wallet, unless you know something I don't know about how to bypass ledger and trezors encryption. Do you own a hardware wallet? Do you know how they work? Even if someone automated their UI on my Mac, they still couldn't bypass the authentication that happens through the hardware device itself. 


Ah, I see why you're unable to open your mind as to how easy it is to secure your own money...you're a turd. A turd that just assumed I haven't been the target because I must be poor. Lol. Yea ok ��. I haven't been the target because I'm not an idiot and all my coins are offline. I haven't been the target because I'm smart and knowledgable on how to protect myself. My Bitcoin is 100x safer than my USD in my bank.

I'm brand new to Bitcoin and I bought 1.3 BTC and started using nicehash to just slowly aquire some. I'm of the mindset I'm holding on to these until I'm filthy rich and it's $50k/BTC.

You have to carry the cash no? What's the difference between carrying that in cash or a phone? I could make plenty more arguments why it's safer than cash.
1. You need to get past my phone's security to use it. Cash, it's stolen it's theirs and no longer yours. 
2. The availability of redundancies such as backing up your wallet. Lose your cash, it's gone forever. 
3. No fumbling with change.

To comment more on your comment, I'm not willing to keep the corrupt banking system alive just to secure jobs. Banking is going to come to an end as we know it today unless crypto slows down or ends. Sure I think banks will still be needed, people wont want to keep millions in bitcoin in their home. the banking system is about to get turned on its head just like taxis and other industries disrupted by technology.

If retail companies are using Bitcoin, the smart ones are cashing out a percentage. Look at overstock, I think they cash out 70 to 80% of the Bitcoin they earn. I remember reading some time last year they cut that number down because they wanted to keep more Bitcoin. In the near future....I don't see this being an issue and companies using Bitcoin being able to keep most of it in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 02:53:03

@_date: 2018-04-09 02:50:55
As much as that would sting, it would be superb for me. I will still be buying. The last halvening basically kicked off this massive bull run, I would expect the next one to be similar, but with even more upside. In the next 20 years, we will have mined a majority of the Bitcoin, like Satoshi said, buy some....just in case it catches on. So I am, using dollar cost average buying with every check. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 03:51:01


I don't consider owning my own money as no value at all. After all, fiat is fucking paper and literally has no value. Idk why I even entertained such a stupid fucking article. Get rekt dude. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:59:51
I'm not sure I would buy in today. But I spent $2500 when it was $1800/coin like I said.  I think if it dropped below $2k or even close I'd buy more. I'm not looking to make a couple buck,s, I'm looking to retire at a young age. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 00:30:03
ya, i kind of figured if im buying some i need to go down with the ship. 
@_date: 2018-07-10 22:07:15
Lol this is glorious
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:50:09
wow thats awesome. I knew about bitcoin but never looked at it until 3 weeks ago seriously. Man I wish I would have been mining it back even a couple years ago. I had the funds and the time. I can only hope I'm not too late! I don't think I am!!
@_date: 2018-04-16 15:02:45
I didn't. I have absolutely no fucking clue how to even report this shit. I use turbo tax every year and I refuse to spend my time to learn how to file this shit properly. I have a million other things to worry about. Plus, I haven't sold a single Satoshi, so I didn't need to report anything. I will be forced to report it some day, I bought from coinbase. Makes me want to sell it all and buy on local bitcoins just so I don't have to worry about this shit. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 03:06:06
Cryto steel ftw.
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:28:16
Yup. Waiting for $4k. Although I might not even make it there. I may get too excited for $4500 and buy a ton there. I do DCA, but I have a reserve ready for situations like this. Don't care if it goes lower. I'll buy more. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 03:48:49
Or permission, or trust 
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:05:54
I just bought $500 worth of litecoin (17 total). Hoping it makes it even close to BTC. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:58:04
Ok thank you. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:42:55
Thanks for the pep talk. You made me realize wha what said above and that holding will eventually bring me what I want. No one expects this shit to crash completely. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:48:54
fuck it, im going down with the ship. it hits $200 im buying as much as I can, hope wife will never know. I first bought in at $1800, then again some at $2500, this will hurt me for sure, but looking at the charts the only people that lose are the people who don't HODL.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:20:52
I'm a flake. I bought 1.3 @ $1800 and I want to sell so bad right now as it's going down. Please talk me out of it.

I love roller coaster rides!
@_date: 2017-07-15 18:49:03

@_date: 2018-04-20 16:36:07
And from what I've seen it's much more than that. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:52:26
Fuck. I should.
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:43:41
Is it really? Right now I'm projected to earn $211 USD in one week. I'm pulling in 0.0122 BTC/Day (although that fluctuates). For someone who doesn't want to risk thousands and thousands of dollars up front, I fee like its actually an alright option. Yea it's slower I guess, but I'm pulling in around the same amount as an S9 would.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:17:34
I should have sold at $2800 but im greedy. Now im not selling again, coz greedy. lol
@_date: 2018-04-05 03:13:24
They always know the most. Especially about satoshis true vision. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 04:23:31
No to all of this. We DO NOT need pr or marketing. If Bitcoin is to survive a d be adopted, it cannot be advertised like a shit coin. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:21:22
lol @ the angry comments, I'm just buying more!! Hope it goes down again close to aug 1!

That stupid crash man. Always gets ya. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:03:08
I would love to cash out to buy back more, but I'm very very shitty at that and I would lose all my money, which is why hodling is best for me. I would LOVE a couple years to buy at $1k prices. My god, I would join the 21 club for sure. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:15:08
Maaaaan I can't wait to take a hot steaming BCC dump August 1st. Can you guys wait a bit so I'm not selling @ $1/BCC?
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:13:32
I think I'm switching to gemini. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:13:21
I second this. I moved USD into my USD wallet from my bank account and it's been saying "Arriving today" for two days. I want to buy some eth and I can't. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 23:24:12
Haha that always helps!!!
@_date: 2017-05-13 00:10:17
Real question, I haven't bought any BTC before, when should I wait to buy some? at what price?
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:25:23
Aw they have a website also. So cute. Lol I wonder what the percentage of people outside of China actually want this
@_date: 2017-07-25 16:09:06
not sure about trezor, I have a ledger, but I read that ledger will be implmenting something in their wallet that will allow me to switch between the two. If I understand their article correctly, to avoid a replay attack I should send my BTC to a BTC address and the BCC to a BCC address to avoid any issues and "split" it. I will most likely send this amount to my bittrex account and then right back into my ledger wallet. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:18:15
I thought about it for a couple minutes and you're totally right. If the place down the street had it I would totally go down and buy some. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:21:57
Best Ive seen yet. I'm taking a major dump with Bitcoin crash as soon as possible. Hopefully I can dump it before it hits $1
@_date: 2018-04-13 03:45:47
There was a pre shower price of $6900 for me and a post shower price of $7500. Not shocked, I've seen it move that fast before, but that volume spiked my god. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 21:23:48
Sucks to be you, I'll hodl until $1000, but lmao at that analogy
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:39:24
Well with a $1500 investment in GPUs I could bring in 2-4 BTC per year. Right now I would have to spend way more for that kind of investment in just straight up buying BTC. This is why I chose this route. I spent $2500 on ~1.3BTC and that was when it was at $1800. Unless there's a dip, I don't have the funds to do that again. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:27:00
@_date: 2017-07-31 02:58:43
Thai so why you never keep your money in an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 20:27:10
I'm on board with it 100% I also bought some more when it was up. I bought a majority of mine when it was at .00041 BTC and I wish I would have bought more. I'm setting up 2 master nodes and mining it now too. There is an entire community of people supporting these. Follow zedomax on twitter, our goal is to buy and HODL the entire supply. That's the end game. At one point there was only 70k left, that was around it's hight, but we got dumped on by some asshole trolls who wanted to do nothing but destroy us. I don't understand why...this community is filled but people with a passion to come together and do something good and prove that our technique works. I honestly think it's due for another steady climb come monday! I would hodl if I was you, you've already lost alot, no sense in cahsing out and losing. If we hold the supply we control the price. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 02:01:11

@_date: 2017-07-25 16:12:41
In coinbase, if you wait one day, you can buy up to $2000 I think using your credit/debit card
@_date: 2018-04-09 03:22:53
If it fell that low, it would just be stupid for me to even sell. I'd probably be buying still though. Lol
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:10:42

i can sell, i always feel like i will sell at the wrong time. so i just hodl and buy the dip!!
@_date: 2017-07-23 04:27:28

I'd never fucking short bitcoin. Jesus, how fucking stupid are you? Also, how fucking stupid are you to get to a point where one move could wipe out everything you have? It's fucks like this that buy and dump everything giving us cheaper Bitcoin to buy during the dips. While I hope this person will not commit suicide, what the fuck did he expect?

@_date: 2017-07-24 04:08:27

@_date: 2017-07-25 19:30:40
Ok, so sending to another wallet, like my phone wallet, is a better option? Then send it back to my ledger wallet correct?

What are you talking about? They have completely redone their model. FFS they are more open source than Google is right now. I'd argue MS is doing all the right things right now. Especially when it comes to software support in the .NET and .NET Core frameworks. They are even releasing a new terminal that is open source.
@_date: 2019-05-11 19:45:54
woah, thats alot of actual real thought and logic you have put into that. shhh people don't like that. they just want to allow people to live their delusions and act like it's ok, when it's completely fucked. It's to the point where some are actually accepting of pedo's who want to touch children. Where does it end? I'll never ever understand the "my baby choses their gender" bullshit. FFS, they are a child and don't understand a fucking thing. I'm gonna let my kid chose to be a bird when they are young, then I'll be shocked when they jump out the 2nd story window because I let them believe they are an actual fucking bird. Of course I'm stretching it to prove a point. I agree with what you said, where are the studies and care put into why this is happening? People need help, and we are just allowing them to live in a fantasy world. I'd also like to state I have no issues with anyone who is gay, tranny, anything. You want to be a fucking Cat, have fun, that's up to you and you do you as long as you aren't hurting someone else. Doesn't mean I dont want to not try to help them.
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:19:31
there is no doubt in my mind this is on purpose. people need to leave coinbase asap
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:01:40
I'm moving everything to bittrex first chance I get. And like you said, offline for save keeping. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 03:30:54
I've never seen one in person but I always hear that the exchange is usually super high priced, so why would someone use one of these to purchase Bitcoin? I can just hop on my phone and do that. One Bitcoin is more widley used I totally understand the purpose of having one. And yea I get we have to start somewhere. Just would like to know the real use case for this. Asking for real.
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:50:07
Haha Bitcoin is nothing but about regret. Regret I didn't sell any at the ATH to buy back more, regret I didn't buy more initially haha. I'm content with Evey Satoshi I have though, need to focus on that.
@_date: 2019-05-08 03:02:03
I'm in complete agreement with you. I don't store my shit on an exchange, I'm not an idiot, but they have been pretty transparent and seem to have prepared for this. I'm sure they will learn as well. Just another reminder to hodl offline.
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:44:30
For sure. But hey I'll take it at whatever price as it feels free. If it does take BTC down with it...I doubt it's for long

I'm up and down with them. In new to the community and I found out real quick that I shouldn't keep crypto in there I intend on trading. I'm checking out that shift card and I think that's a huge positive from what they offer. All these other cards you basically load BTC on to them and the money gets converted to USD right away. I like how the shift card pulls the amount at the exchange rate from you Coinbase account. 
@_date: 2019-05-07 17:40:11

@_date: 2017-06-15 22:58:04
I'm not really sure to be honest. In my situation I still have coinbase so I might transfer back to there when it's not being bogged down just for moving it to USD. I think there are other exchanges that you can use although im not knowledgeable on them. I'm still new to this as well. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:34:42
I saw a post about some guy who had his account hacked easily using only sms 2 factor authentication. If you are using that, abandon that for Google authenticator. Much more secure. I've also stopped clicking ALL links in any email I receive since I've started buying BTC. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:05:53
I was just talking to someone who doesn't "understand the appeal" of BTC. He then also informs me that he and his buddy were going to start mining it two years ago....he's still convinced it was a good idea to not pursue it 2 years ago.....even though he would be filthy rich. My head hurts so much at his stupidity.

I bought the same package as you. How long did it take for you to get yours after purchase OP? I want mine offline asap but I fear doing so workout this device. When I was checking out they said it could be as late as July 22nd and that's cutting it close for Aug 1st. Either way, I'm trying to prepare for Aug 1st because I want to decide what happens with my shit if needed. Not some exchange.

Just wait for the pullback! I think there is a good chance we pullback before we go back up, at least I hope so. Obvy that isn't guaranteed, but usually when I fee such Glee like this it dumps, I'm actually looking to sell some rn and wait for the pullback. I'm an avid hodler, so take my words lightly, I doubt I'll actually sell any. Lol. Clearly this is why hodlgang is so strong, it's a sure fire way to never lose any BTC, but I also won't gain any unless I invest more $.

That's exactly why I want my BTC offline by August 1st, in case of a fork. I ordered the ledger but I don't think it will be here on time. As for losing something like the ledger or any kind of cold storage, I would think if someone was smart enough to figure out how to cold store it they would have redundancies right? I bought two ledgers, maybe I don't know wnough yet but I plan on haveing two instances of my BTC. If not, I know I can store it on the ledger and have it printed out on paper as well. I will go as far as to lamanating it. The only downside I see then is making sure you have it stored in more than one location in case of a fire...but who can you trust? I don't have enough yet to care at this point. I just font want an exchange deciding what I do with my BTC. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 05:18:28
Coinbase asked me when I was transferring all my BTC out of their exchange if it was going to another exchange....it was...but fuck that in telling them what was happening with my BTC. Same can be said for this. Ain't no way in hell they will ever know what's in my wallet. And if BTC becomes usable anywhere....they can't track shit either. They will never know how much I'm spending. Well, that's assuming I don't have to scan my I'd to pay for things. Let's hope these businesses who do start to accept don't ever make that a requirement. GOD I LOVE BITCOIN.

@_date: 2017-06-14 15:01:47
So basically it's because bitmain doesn't want to lose the business because they have figured out a way to best the system... kinda. That's what it sounds like to me. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 02:11:23
I don't think it will plummet, I think it will actually shoot up. The forked coin called Bitcoin cash everyone will get, they will be dumping it. You never know, but I would expect BTC to drop a bit July 31st, and then just fucking sky rocket AUG1st. Ledger wallet has informed me that I will receive some of the shit coin Bitcoin cash...I just hope I can dump it on bittrex because I'm not signing up for viaBtc just to sell it. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 18:21:26
as soon as it was back up....i pulled everything. they have lost my business forever. fuck coinbase.
@_date: 2017-06-28 16:51:46
I like you
@_date: 2017-06-27 04:59:52
Would the best decision be to have my coins offline by August 1st?
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:31:42
Ok, I have a lot to learn. I didn't understand most of that. Thanks for the attempt though, its me, not you :). I wont have time to research and understand things for another 4 weeks due to lack of time, so for now, Ill just invest and use it for purchases!
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:38:19
ironically ive noticed its only down when the price is plummeting. When its going up, they are never down. At least with the short amount of time ive used it i've noticed. I've been here since $1800....which is like a month ago :)
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:42:57
That's a better idea. This is why I don't day trade with my BTC and just HODL, but im fine with gambling with something I got for "free" and have no intentions on keeping.

It's actually a really good feature. Only reason I stuck with them is because of this vault. You have to authenticate via Google authenticator to even begin to move your BTC. Then after you do initiate it you have to approve it on the website and through a second email address that you have setup. Then after that it's a 2 day waiting period until it's actually out of the vault. You get a text message and an email about the withdraw and you can cancel it within this 2 day time frame. I wish more websites had this protocol. I'm new so I don't know much, but for me it feels like the next safest thing other than cold storage.

Cool story bro. Can I hear it again right now?
@_date: 2017-06-15 19:39:02
Every time it plummets coinbase is offline. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:15:49
Agreed. It's clears he's trying to come of ass "meh I'm fine where I am"...like why would you want to be a millionaire anyway right? 
@_date: 2019-05-21 02:00:02
You're 100% right and Im removing phone 2fa now. Not worth it. Even though I keep nothing on an exchange. Not your keys not your coin
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:55:44
Lol hell no
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:55:08
As long as I'm still in the green, id probably jump on board with a panic sale, and then buy the dip. Doubt it will be that cut and dry though. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:36:57
god fucking damnt, they are still down. holy shit man. This is completely unacceptable. I feel bad for the people who actually did want to sell on the way down and buy at the "dip". wow. Someone needs to sue the fuck out of this website. it should be shut down. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 15:25:58
I didn't realize the digital was available now! Downloaded it last night. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:19:48
I lol'ed at this because there is no way for them to know what's in my wallet ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2017-06-22 02:34:42
My wife thinks millibits sounds naughty. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:49:59
Please make a new post about it. I would love to see this as well. I was disappointed with there being now video in that link. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:47:01
Seriously. When I come to this Reddit and I see a new post with it...I still laughing or smile every time. Anyone who complains about has got to goooo
@_date: 2017-06-20 03:18:26
Sorry. I don't like to announce on the internet what I'm using. I only even mentioned coinbase because I'm not using them anymore. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:40:41
yup. it's nice that you can purchase the BTC without the fiat actually being in your account, but it takes forever to show up. I even saw it leave my bank account and panicked for like 4 days before it actually  showed up in coinbase. Once they are back online im moving everything I have out of there. I'm sure others like me wont help with the stability of the website by doing this. maybe I should wait until for a day where there isn't much action. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 15:30:46
Man the day I decide to manage firends or family funds for them for crypto...ef that. People around me think it's play money and isn't real and shit talk it even though they prove my aguments about why BTC is so beneficial. Ain't no way I'm helping them out and dealing with the roller coaster with them on the seat next to me bitching about how they want to get off. I can't wait to throw it in everyone's face later. Does that make me a bad person? Even after I explain the benefits to people they still hair chose to say it shit or fake. Tired of simple minds. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:44:48
 Using bittrex now. Only thing I can't do there is convert to USD. I'm fine with that because it's always working. I like their security settings as well. You can block all transactions outside your home ip from ever hapnneing. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:02:11
Haha I didn't even notice that. The post couldn't be more perfect. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 17:38:32
So do we know already that 2x isn't happening? 
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:03:17
Lol 10 min transaction time haha you show you're true colors that you don't know shit. That the block time you turd. I bought my VPN using bitcoin, was done in seconds. Also I guess you be never heard of something called segwit I guess in regards to transaction fees. Lol fuck out of here with hour bhullshit. Bitcoin is still in its infancy and with the future enhancements to come....it will only be more and more widely adopted. God you're a retard. Have fun with your debit card and your shit fiat
