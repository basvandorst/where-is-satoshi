did you write down your mnemonic or private key?
@_date: 2015-12-15 01:26:13
it can be a sequence of character, you shoud have a public key thats your address, and a private key, thats your key to the wallet
@_date: 2015-12-15 01:21:41
no its a sequence of words that you have to write to recover the wallet, what wallet application are you using?
@_date: 2015-06-08 09:42:25
on the right click the recover wallet button.

Sell half,then if the price goes down 10$ buy 75% of the 50% again, if it goes up 20$ sell 25% 0f the remaining. Then reinvest 22.54% of your profits when the price drops 18%.  In 12 months you will probably end up with $5000 or $0 or $20000 but its gonna be a fun and complicated year. Just kidding. Do wathever you want its your money.

And there is this 
@_date: 2015-05-11 19:23:15
You should give us more information about you and your company, you have a new web site, a new reddit account, how do we know we can trust you with our bitcoins? There is not much on the web site either and it looks like you made it in an hour. Im not willing to take a chance. Good luck.
@_date: 2015-05-22 10:18:44
I never bought anything with bitcoin yet, today is the day, and its going to be pizza, of course.

Don't put money in it. Someone else might spend it. The will wait till you put enough.
@_date: 2015-04-14 18:36:56
In that case that could mean time traveling around the 1000+ ...or the 0.01c and start over

There is no presale today, the site now says:
Presale postponed - Stay tuned
Our rollout revealed a way to buy NeuCoins without accepting the Terms &amp; Conditions.
Legal advised us to wait until this has been resolved. To give everyone a fair chance to start at the same time, we will communicate a new start time shortly on our forum, blog, twitter and email.

Ok thanks for the infos
@_date: 2015-04-26 01:07:41
how do people know you have bitcoins in the first place? If they dont know they wont be looking for the password.
@_date: 2015-04-20 14:31:52
Why would you still do the trade knowing its a scam? Your losing your time. What if paypal does not reverse the transaction?
@_date: 2015-04-30 23:56:15
In person at quadrigacx 
@_date: 2015-04-21 09:50:53
I know. i tried it with the chrome plugin and its a cool way to login. I have been using it for a couple of weeks.
@_date: 2015-03-12 19:15:56
he does everything and everything is free! At least there is activity on that bitcoin classified  site now.
@_date: 2015-03-28 20:48:49
of course it will be tampered with
@_date: 2015-04-17 16:09:19
i was going to post but non standard stopped showing after one confirmatio.
@_date: 2015-03-06 20:47:39
I completely agree with you, bitcoin is traceable and cash is not, and the idea that the goverment might be behind it havent crossed my mind before, but it makes sense. Even if they are not, its at their advantage to replace cash with bitcoin to control every transaction.
@_date: 2015-03-27 10:55:07
Im in canada and circle works fine. I took me about a week to be approved
@_date: 2015-03-22 15:22:13
ok i guess you can only add ninki contacts by username and not other wallets contacts based on address?
@_date: 2015-03-05 01:06:28
new message now
Scheduled maintenance
We are currently performing scheduled maintenance. We will be available shortly.
We apologize for the inconvenience.
Im not worried, i dont keep bitcoins online.
@_date: 2015-03-22 15:40:48
i'll be sure to use it again then, i see it has lots of potential and i like the interface.
@_date: 2015-03-26 16:59:06
If by every day you mean every five minutes...
@_date: 2015-03-22 20:35:44
Have two..its free
@_date: 2015-03-27 19:49:45
Excellent idea..but.Ouch!
@_date: 2015-03-28 20:19:46
why not order one?
@_date: 2015-03-05 00:26:54
the site works, but i cant loggin, sorry
@_date: 2015-03-19 14:34:55
I use Greenaddress,and i think it answers all your concerns. 
Check it out here:  
@_date: 2015-03-05 00:24:26
works for me...not!
@_date: 2015-03-22 14:57:17
Still playing with it.I am trying to create an invoice in the chrome app and i cant. I tried in the invoice tab an in the receive option and how do you add contacts? I cant add the address where i sent btc to my contacts.
@_date: 2015-03-12 20:09:45
yeah i guess you have to see the front page to know what its about.
@_date: 2015-03-08 15:44:30
Greenaddress has that, if you want to spend over the limit you have to use 2fa code
@_date: 2015-03-24 14:07:40
keep it. You create a new wallet with it anyways
@_date: 2015-03-09 01:57:57
ok, makes sense. I got scared for 10 seconds
@_date: 2015-03-04 23:39:14
Try watchmybit.com where people have to pay bitcoins to watch your videos
@_date: 2015-03-09 18:24:02
i would like to see a video of that device in action.
@_date: 2015-03-22 13:31:41
I found the fee explanation here 
@_date: 2015-03-24 21:32:27
Did you email ben? admin
@_date: 2015-02-23 00:13:48
Try greenaddress on android. It writes directly on nfc tag.and you can log in your wallet with it
@_date: 2015-03-13 01:11:24
well done! If you need help translate in french msg me. And also if you need some 3d for your animations.
@_date: 2015-03-22 15:16:35
I sent him a link, thanks for the info.
@_date: 2015-02-25 12:05:28
Your right i did not see that. I applied as a producer and i think it has potential. Its still in beta i think.
@_date: 2015-02-25 11:12:23
here is an example of a non porn video site who accept micropaiements: 
@_date: 2015-02-23 23:05:52
im in canada and Circle works for me. It was a pain and took about a week to be able to purchase btc (id scans etc..) but now it works. The downside is a $100 weekly limit.
@_date: 2015-02-24 11:06:16
i think everybody would needs an app on their phone to transfer monocoins in that version and buy internet domains instead of land. Railroad becomes isp, electric company becomes microsoft. Silkroad instead of go and  get 200btc. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 21:43:54
i think you can use greenaddress also
@_date: 2017-06-03 01:37:33
i think you just have to send the bitcoins to the new wallet, your ledger has the new address now.
