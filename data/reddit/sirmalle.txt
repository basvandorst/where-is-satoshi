I agree that it's something which should be treated, but showing a bar with a given number of days would possibly be more disingenuous. As it is now, any value which is 0 is either because there is no data (as in June 2011) or it hasn't been possible yet to sell for a profit. Adding a bar of "days until today", i.e. the minimum required value, would not leave this visible, unless something else was modified as well.
I modified the image so that for the dates which it has not been possible to sell for a profit, the area is instead greyed out.

Just be careful with whether Verizon means .00000001 dollars or .00000001 cents.

I've had success with kraken.com the last few weeks. For the lowest level of verification at which you can add USD or EUR they require name, date of birth, country of residence, phone number and address verification.
