you would probably know futures exchanges better than I though.

Because even my grandmother knows what a bit-coin is-- so it has recognition. It's kinda like asking "why samsung phone?" it's not better (and it can explode) but people KNOW it exists and can easily get it, -v- something like the BLU or Moto e4. It's basically shoved down their throats.
This isn't to say it doesn't have it's own unique benefits and intrinsic value-- but is to say why the "hype" surrounds it main-stream.

You'd pay taxes on how much you made when you sold it less the depreciation on your mining rigs and the costs of electricity for them and technically the amount of space they take up in your house/area as you could claim a home office deduction, I think. Best bet is to 100% CONSULT A TAX ACCOUNTANT, whose fees are tax deductible (next year) as you can't take advice online as valid for your personal taxes. 
I am not an accountant and this is 100% not official tax advice.

Hopefully it was the credit card you were using which was blocked, if it was the debit card that's some b/s. Further, I wonder what'd happen if you tried to deposit money?

Korean news; market reactions, futures market reactions, blood in the water, opportunity for profit.

Margin calls have already been made on many of them which seems to be driving down the price.
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:34:18
Same here. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:32:37
Yes; just like the universe. Ask Wesley Crusher, he knows all 'bout bubbles. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:50:30
It probably averages; and don't forget the effect of the Korean exchanges which trade often at a 40% premium.

I would think, it would follow the stock market as many people are forced to liquefy assets to cover their debts. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:13:53
Drop in pricing also causing margin calls. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:58:47
If they don't transfer in money to cover the difference, then they are forced to liquidate their position, e.g. selling off bitcoins. So for example, you get a margin call that you much deposit $10000 or so into your account because of a price dip, and you don't, your contract of bitcoins (sometimes in the thousands) is "called" and your coins are sold for whatever the market price is (which drive it down). This happens because when you bought the contract you didn't put up the full amount for ALL the bitcoins you have a contract on-- you may have a contract for, say, $10000 of bitcoins but you only put in $6000. So long as the price stays above a certain level, the brokerage knows at the time of liquidation you'll have enough to cover the $4000 you essentially "borrowed" from them. 
This is simplified in the numbers involved, of course, but that's the just of it.

If it did it wouldn't we worth 500K anyway. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 08:58:03
While i'm no expert, i'm pretty sure this just means the difficulty adjusts to the new load, and thus, nothing much changes.

Bitcoins can be divided down into the millionth (Satoshis) much like a dollar is divided down into pennies. However, currently, due to transaction fees, it is not used for smaller purchases much as you wouldn't use a $100 bill to buy a 5c bazooka joe gum.

I agree; I think after an initial sell-off those with monies left over will quickly migrate to "safe havens," like Gold and possible crypto, as it'll be seen at a heavy discount. This is, of course, assuming it doesn't go down to much, e.g. I think if BC went down below 5K then you might not see any rebound into it until well after a financial recovery. But that's just my "gut feeling." 
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:27:03
I wouldn't bet on it; but as it'll be a Monday here in the US, you can expect there to be price movement by providence of it being a monday. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 22:32:22
They're settled in cash; to the investor; but I do think bitcoins to actually change hands between the exchange and the market. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 22:09:23
Exactly; it's really a bet on the value of bitcoin, settled in cash-- a bet.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:13:50
Good to know. I've been trying to get more under-the-hood with all this over the past few months as I slowly get into the marketplace. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:31:03
Here's hoping! Thankfully I didn't put in too much, so I can survive either way lol. Just got wrapped up by all the talk on set (which actually happened when it his 19K) So figured might as well give it a go. Wish I had bought in when I first heard about bitcoin in 2010 lol; but you know, hindsight. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:59:46
No worries. And yeah the prices are high; but i can see a few ways it can be a currency in my mind. But that's another story wholly. 
Another option I could think of is maybe opening up an online savings account; like through American Express or Capital one, something like that, and sending the money there, then to your "real" bank account.  Of course you'll have to give those companies your real info as well; but it adds another layer between you and the online company. It would be harder to get through from your American Express into your "real bank." Plus they often have some nice(er) interest rates on savings accounts--- nothing really "wow" but better than I get with my real bank.

I don't think anyone ever wants to loose, even if they can afford it (personally I'd be very sad if I didn't get my bitcoin sailboat lol)
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:36:49
send me a coin so i can check if my wallet is working correctly, 
I'll let you know if it's ok lol.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:59:55
apparently it was this one according to wallet thingi:
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:03:43
Good luck and warm holidays my friend. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:27:54
I know quite a few people who did (and some who pull x %  a month out). 
Sadly I bought in recently, so haven't made house money this week that's for sure lol
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:05:54
if memory/understanding serves, such things reduce fees and increase time? Or something similar? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:49:23
I mean you're basically just running into US regulations; which, well, they exist. 
Your best bet might be to sell the coins to a real person in the real world for real cash.
See the issue is you need to pay a tax on the income of the sale, and the sites which deal with bank accounts etc, well, they're going to make sure to create reports to stay on the good side of the IRS. 
Sadly I don't think you'll find an easy, legit way around this in the US as a US Citizen aside from a private party sale, in the real world, for real cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:07:40
It would certainly kill the speculation on bitcoin.
