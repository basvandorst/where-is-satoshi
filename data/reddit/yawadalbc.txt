New adopters of bitcoin focus to much on the "bitcoin is only a payment system"-thing. Thinkingbitcoin is only payment, is like thinking internett is only email.

No one can answer your questions and be sure they are 100% right. If they did, they would be billionaires and def. not telling anybody.

It would only happen in America. If he was a european, caught in europe, he would get 10-20 years max. ShinyFlakes, who sold hundreds of kilos of drugs on darkweb from Germany got 7 years if I don`t remember wrong.

It`s much safer to buy and sell on Localbitcoins.com 
Then you dont have to upload money to a shady exchange, you connect to other sellers and buyers and uses Localbitcoins own escrow. I feel it`s much safer.

And the european way is more fair, if you ask me... Life in prison is sick for a crime like this. I see people in Texas get 30-40 years for stealing a t-shirt for the third time. Only serial killers, children killers and phedophiles deserves life.

What scares me is his words on a bubble on bitcointalk: 
“The danger is if people are buying bitcoins in the expectation that the price will go up, and the resulting increased demand is what is driving the price up. That is the definition of a BUBBLE, and as we all know, bubbles burst.”
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:25:51
In 3 year`s you should have done that. Just think of it that way. It will hurt for a time, but the pain will go over to happiness soon.

Im not sure about eth. The coin dont wake my interest, so I dont know so much about it. Not saying its a bad coin dough.
I beleive more in monero. Monero is 100% anonymous, and in not to long all darkweb buyers will move over to monero. And they are a big part of the bitcoin economy. When they move to monero, I think the coin will go drastictly up.

I recomend a offline wallet. Trezor is my favourite. More info about Trezor here --&gt;

I have asked myself the question too, and is correct. Its supply and demand, and supply when all the coins are mined means how many people willing to sell.
And maybe you ask yourself why miners should still operate when all coins are mined? They also make money on transaction fees.
