A good way to protect the password is if you don't actually know the password. I suggest getting the program Password Safe.

The correct term is, "[Sounds Legit](

I've been going to [VirWox]( for a while as they had good prices to exchange Second Life Lindens into US$. I found out that they actually have a Dollar to Bitcoin Exchange as well.
I'm pretty sure they work with Euros as well. The account is free to make.
I would also like to note that I'm not affiliated with this company at all. I simply started using them when Second Life bought the nice Exchange place that everyone was using.

I'm a charity case and always accept bitcoins. As well as any other form of money.
I hate being poor.

I didn't know that digital currencies needed sex toys. Is it like a defragment tool? Or I know I know a CCleaner like tool that cleans up the HD its stored on.

I'm so tired of the MPAA and the RIAA and their inability to to advance their technology to today's standards.
Their old outdated model works well in the Physical world but in the digital world where it takes no money at all to make a copy is simply obsolete.

Was this resolved? I've used virwox to transfer SLL to USD before and had no problems.

If someone wants to learn if their passwords they use are secure they should just try to make a hushmail account.

Have you been over to I mean lately? Apparently all websites in the US can't be trusted.

I've never used anything other than Qt but saving your addresses into separate files seems like it would be a nice feature but saving them all together is much easier.

Get SecondLife Lindens, then Deposit your lindens into a VirWoX vendor in the game. Go to the VirWoX website and convert them into bitcoin. Send Bitcoin to your desired address.

Couldn't we already do this with [cryptocat?](

That game looks like it's from the 80s. Ick

I'm waiting for an MMORPG to come out with a Bitcoin based currency. 
Integrated into the background of the game would be a program so your computer can mine for bitcoin. It could be a standard MMO but everything bought or sold would be based in BTC there would be no vendors. Everything would be bought or sold to other players only. Sort of like in EvE or Second Life.
Heck Second Life is Open Source someone could mod Second Life to take BTC and mine coins while people play.

I think and this is only my opinion that removing the criminal element from bitcoin can do nothing but help it.

All your bit, bit bit. All your bit, coins belong to us.

What I love about Leo is that he always try's to keep everything casual and laid back.
I like how he tries to keep it simple and ask's questions that the non-technical can understand and might actually ask themselves.
I don't think some of the people on this thread liked how casual he is and somehow mistook his casualness as some sort of vain thing.
I watch a lot of Leo Laporte and he is one of the most humble people out there. We should stop jumping to conclusions.

Fine then, "currently perceived" criminal element.

Shoot. I'm 0.04 away from having .5 coins! I always seem to miss these things.
