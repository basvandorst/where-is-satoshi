You can by any fraction of a bitcoin down to 0.00000001BTC, so you could by $1.56 worth from coinbase or anyone else.

Just a reminder that if you want to support Open Bazaar, and don't have any significant coding abilities like myself, you can throw bitcoins at those who are building it.  I donated 0.1BTC yesterday specifically because I want this project to become reality.

I have found the best way to get people into bitcoin is to have them download a wallet (blockchain for iOS typically) and then send them 0.001BTC.  That way, they see the power of peer-to-peer.  Then add that with the numbers encoded by the QR code you could send money just as fast and easily anywhere in the world.

Coinbase seems to be a very reputable company.  Maybe not perfect, but probably one of the best you will find in the lassiez faire world of bitcoin.  I, and many others, have given them our banking details and not had problems.  I thus have the ability to instantly purchase bitcoin from my phone anywhere I have internet access.  Did I give up a little trust to them?  Yes.  Do I keep significant amounts or bitcoin with them? No. Is what I get for what I gave up worth it?  I think so.

I've been telling a buddy in Cyprus and my wife's cousin in Spain to buy bitcoin since it was $10.  Neither listened to me then.  Now my wife's cousin finally got me to get her two coins at $450 each a few weeks ago.  I'll see here at Christmas and hope to set her up as a localbitcoins.com seller.  There is no one within a 100km of her.  I think southern Europe is just slow to adopt.

  The importance of enabling two factor when dealing with botcoin is super super important.  To not spend a moment on it would be a huge disservice.  I have starting giving away 1mBTC to any friend who will set up a wallet.  When doing so I mention the importance of 2FA about ten or more times.  I compare it to all the pain in the ass, most bs, government computer security we deal with at work.  With bitcoin, it actually matters!  With bitcoin, there is no third party to dispute a transaction. You are your own security.

I originally used MtGox to purchase my first bitcoins because I thought the whole localbitcoins thing was a bit shady, dangerous, or just plan scary.  Now I've done both cash in person and cash deposit in someone else's account to purchase bitcoins using localbitcoins.  Yes, I had to push myself a bit, but it was for the best.  I'd really urge you to try it.  Choose a seller with a lot of good feed back and don't use all your money on the first go.  If it goes well, you can always do another purchase.  
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:34:13
No.  You don't need to buy one coin.  You can buy $800 worth and get one and a fraction of another coin.  The placement of the decimal point is merely for human understanding.

BTC doesn't follow anything except the protocol.  The protocol doesn't address exchange, only transactions and mining of new coins.  Thus, bitcoin markets a free to do as the markets want.

You need to make it easy for poker players to adapt bitcoin.  My brother is a very serious poker player, having made his living via both live and online for the last five years.  He now spends more than half the year outside the US due to the inability to easily and openly play from the US.  Thus, I have been repeatedly extolling the virtues of bitcoin since I discovered it in 2011.  He still owns zero bitcoin.  Why? Because, even though he can handle the math of competatively playing 10+ tables online at a time, he is like most people and he thinks bitcoin is complicated and difficult for him to use.  
Maybe you could set up a site where people legal buy bitcoins from you in the US, but then you automatically move the bitcoins to your offshore site and convert them back to dollars.  Thus, the poker player only sees dollars, but you are using bitcoin to get around our ridiculous puritanical laws.

I recently bought three from hardbtc.org.  Great transaction.  Gouge isn't really an appropriate term.  There is a limited supply and he takes the risk of accepting PayPal for btc.  When there is a limited supply and high demand, we use markets to match th two.  If you don't like it, don't buy them.  Of note, he posted them without any value on them, which is good for both security and customs.  Then when I. Received them and let him know, he transferred 1btc each to each coin's address.

I understand your point and have discovered the same difficulty in people's understanding of fiat every since I swallowed the red pill.  I think a better way to precisely describe the negative aspect of fiat currency is to refer to it as "currency that can be debased."  With a central bank issues reserve note debasement is particularly insidious since the holder of the note doesn't see it.  However printing more notes is really no different than actually debasing a precious metal coin.

Jennifer Shasky Calvery's comments on regulatory hurdles are delusional.  Although the EU has many member states, who still retain their autonomy, and has way more regulations, the ability of citizens to make a living in other states is far easier than between US states.  Each state's regulations are mostly protectionist in nature.

As a proud member of the US military, I find this statement of Weisenthal laughable.  Not only would we not actually be able to do such a mission, even if willing, but it's not what we signed up for.  Any president who directed the Pentagon to engage in such a mission would have a hard time convincing the generals and admirals to deploy.  If we can't get Iraqis to stop killing each other, how might we force an occupied country to  use our currency?
Witness the recent broad opposition in America when Obama planned on putting a Syria resolution to Congress.  Left and right of this country are finally fed up with unnecessary wars.  Weisenthal should go fuck himself.

What about all Satoshi's unmoved bitcoins?  Perhaps Satoshi was a government group.  Once it reaches the mainstream, that government will announce they hold something like a million bitcoins.  They then can control the price pretty easily.

Adding more digits to the right of the decimal point doesn't change the value of anyone's bitcoins.  If I start with 1.00000000 bitcoins and the protocol is changed to allow ten digits to the right of the decimal, then I still have 1.0000000000 bitcoins, which is exactly the same.  By the time this might need to occur, bitcoin will be far more stable in fiat terms than it is now, so it won't affect the value of one bitcoin.  
The number of decimals is not set in stone; it is set in the protocol.  What matters is that no one person has the power to change it.  Some with enough authority would have to suggest is.  Gavin is the obvious choice.  However, although he could update the code to make it happen, the majority of miners have to decide it's the right thing to do.  If a major stick with code that supports eight decimal places, then eight it remains.  
An example: you have one satoshi.  The two digits are added.  Now you can have satoshi cents.

I had a similar issue.  Rather than redo the whole Satoshi client and download the blockchain again, just upload the wallet.dat to blockchain.info.  Just make sure to protect yourself with setting up their two-factor authentication.  I used my phone and it took about two minutes. I slept much better after I recovered my Bitcoins this way.  Then, I just got a new laptop today to setup cold storage with Armory with paper backups.
