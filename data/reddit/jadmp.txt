Oh yea? I was pretty sure bitch don’t ever try me on my momma you a broke boy.  Better step off before you catch this fade you little shit.
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:10:40
Aren’t there trading pairs like btc/Ltc? I don’t use gdax but I would assume they have these. If not you could use binance 
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:28:05
pretty sure you don't need to pay taxes for any profit under 600 dollars

That’s less than a transaction fee��
@_date: 2018-09-14 01:03:09
Ahh I see, thanks for the explanation 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:53:41
Hmmm. I don’t think 2 dollars a week for constantly clicking is worth it 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:55:37
lol yes but ur more likely to drown in oxygen 
@_date: 2018-09-13 22:25:16
Disclaimer I own zero BCH and only BTC but being the devils advocate, I haven’t seen a successful double spend involving both transactions going through. Although I don’t monitor it 24/7 I would assume a successful double spend involving a fee would make headlines. Can you link an article or image? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:26:02
Ahhhh thank you very much 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:40:32
Then legally change ur middle name for bitcoin donations

@_date: 2018-09-14 01:03:31
Thank you for the clarification 
@_date: 2018-09-13 22:38:09
Yes, to clarify I ment that I haven’t seen a double spend included in a block. Can you explain how double spend attacks work? I’m not too sure what you ment
