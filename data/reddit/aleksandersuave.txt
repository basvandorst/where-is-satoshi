you can go be an opponent of whatever you feel like, I dont really care.
It doesnt change the fact that people dont like you. You are a contrarian at best. Go HODL the nuts in your mouth.

compounding multiple failures from multiple financial institutions, ="one bad experience" in your world.
yes. and the holocaust was just "a few people killed" by that same logic.

I was in odessa. still considering buying some property there, and visiting again. This didnt sour the experience enough to turn me away.

I have done the same, except my wallet was stolen. I was able to access money from an "extended hours" branch that operates on the weekends inside of a grocery store. Its a shame that Chase chose to get rid of most of them.

they provide shelter to homeless youth in large cities.
I slept outside 2 years ago, in Michigan November, to raise money for the Detroit chapter of this organization.

Thanks for the advice. I am definitely interested. Hard to find credible sources of information though between all the bandwagons and FUDs.

I’ve got similar memories of childhood, with us sending things to my grandmother to sell. Or my father being paid in groceries for electrical work. Those were definitely some times to grow up in.

Yes, me calling in advance of my trip to put a travel alert on my accounts is clearly evidence of my complacent lifestyle.

If youve never lived in any other countries than your perspective of American education, healthcare, and public transportation is not really educated enough to deem anything horrendous.
Ive lived in a few countries, and call the US home currently.  
The best universities exist in America, the best doctors all work here, and while public transportation is hit or miss depending on where you live, the subways and busses in this country are still a lot safer than in many others.  
If you walk in a hospital in the US 9/10 times you can be treated for anything right there.   
Those things are not the *cheapest*  here, but that does not make them horrendous by any means.

Added an unusual amount of stress and neurotic obsession to my life.

Why is this so surprising and unbelievable to some?
How much of the market got in during December, bet everything they had, and are now feeling the burn?
