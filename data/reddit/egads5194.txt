Why wouldn't I advise people on how to stop shooting themselves in the foot? Basic empathy.

The funny thing is that your argument applies to bitcoin and other "fair launch" coins just as well because of the hoarding and extremely skewed distribution.

Linus Torvalds personally owns the Linux trademark. To get your lawsuit going, all you have to do is to bring Satoshi on board.

The clearest way is to have the symbols B2X, BCASH and BCORE under the BITCOIN namespace.
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:59:01
Based on your posting history I thought it was right up your alley.
@_date: 2017-08-04 10:48:57
Because inflation and deflation are not the same. In an inflationary environment you simply invest your money and receive an interest rate that is a bit higher than the inflation, everyone's happy. In a deflationary environment credit/investment to small-profit ventures dries out because the lender/investor profits more by not lending at all.

Perhaps you should stop mixing them?

Almost every mainstream expert is wrong and stupid, only we very smart redditors know the secret truth. But we're definitely not a superstitious delusional cult, that's crazy talk.
@_date: 2017-08-04 10:07:27
Sorry but they're right:

Except they don't, in reality.
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:05:13
Time spent on reddit obviously correlates strongly with being very smart and a cryptography expert.

And then the newsstand owner angrily stormed out and told you to scram and take your bitcoin magazine with you.

Luckily we at least know that only 21 million cars will ever exist and therefore their current owners will get rich if they just hodl on to them.

The US federal budget is public info, look it up and you don't have to wonder anymore. Most of that $20 trillion is private debt though.

Whitelist for legal UTXOs. Coins acquired through an unlicensed atomic swap? Useless.
@_date: 2017-09-05 19:09:33
The 8% ATM fees in each direction in no way demolish this use case because
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:10:46
2 years it is then.
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:18:35
Well, either that or go to jail for breaking the law? The users would learn quickly enough, and this would simply boost the value of the whitelisted coins as the dirty ones become worthless.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:13:25
So the first tree is bitcoin and the second one bitcoin cash, and the rest are ICOs?
@_date: 2017-09-27 00:21:17
Nobody cares about reversibility, everybody cares about theft and nonintentional losses. This is why merchants don't like bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-09-06 10:52:12
No, you misread my answer. They aren't using bitcoins because they can create a new network from scratch using a better technology, and also don't have to enrich the current bitcoin hodlers for no reason at all.
@_date: 2017-09-27 05:00:16
Well guess what, the law does not see it that way.

How about looking it up on Wikipedia or something instead of idly speculating about it then?

There's absolutely no reason to transfer any wealth to the existing cryptosquatters when you can just as easily start with a clean ledger.
@_date: 2017-10-06 20:53:30
If bitcoin was meant to be proprietary software I think Satoshi should have used a different license.
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:32:45
Nonsense, just don't make illegal transactions, use atomic swaps to launder your money, or accept coins from non-whitelist UTXOs yourself and you'll be fine. Any coins that are confiscated by the law enforcement authorities can be re-whitelisted.
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:37:35
@_date: 2017-09-14 00:53:20
The history of all hitherto existing cryptos is the history of falling into obvious scams. I wouldn't call the people involved particularly informed or prudent.
@_date: 2017-09-09 14:59:42
This is the future of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-05 19:19:13
Yep, it doesn't take a genius to figure that out.
@_date: 2017-09-06 10:54:09
I guess the bitcoin ATMs are convenient for buying small amounts of illegal drugs online if the KYC features aren't very good.

@_date: 2017-09-01 10:09:31


And it's so cheap too! Bitcoin has no fees you know, that's why all the unbanked land registries are rushing to use it.
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:09:48
So, can they scale? What kind of simulations have you run?
@_date: 2017-09-27 00:23:47
Wow, they didn't outright steal your money.
@_date: 2017-09-27 05:01:39
And *still* they prefer fiat to bitcoins! There must be something terribly wrong with bitcoin.

Sometimes you guys do seem to get irrationally angry at things happening outside your echo chamber.
@_date: 2017-10-08 10:12:03
Actually most bitcoin ATMs don't give you cash for bitcoins, only the opposite.
@_date: 2017-09-26 13:33:52


This is why nobody ever lost any bitcoins due to theft or their own fuckups.
@_date: 2017-10-06 21:46:29
Lol you actually are arguing about "what Satoshi meant" as opposed to what's real.
@_date: 2017-10-04 20:30:06
Hmm lots of people here seem to disagree with you, maybe *you're* mistaken about the true nature of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-06 10:45:31
You just paid a fee using the ATM, and probably another hidden fee in the exchange rate. WU fees for small fast transfers are around 10%, i.e. about the same and easier. If your brother had a normal debit/credit card he could have just withdrawn the money and paid a 3% fee. If he had a mobile banking app on his phone you could have used that for next to no fee.
@_date: 2017-10-07 08:22:26
Let's imagine you're a responsible parent instead and will pay her room using a credit card or wire her some money via WU instead of sending her bit coins which the hotel won't accept.
@_date: 2017-10-06 21:54:17
Well some of them will of course but they aren't *true* bitcoin nodes.
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:18:02
Wow, just like bitcoin a few years ago!
@_date: 2017-09-13 01:14:28
So bitcoin would go up uP UP forever if only "intelligent people" were using it?
@_date: 2017-10-07 15:15:41
BTC, it's in the name of the subreddit.
@_date: 2017-10-05 06:11:14

Sure, but the good people of wouldn't be using bitcoin in the first place if they were capable of that.
