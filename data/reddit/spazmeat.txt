I just got an email from Pizza Hut saying I have a large Ultimate Cheese Lover's on the way. :) Sweet.

"(REMEMBER: Your credit card transaction will be processed by your Pizza Hut location and you must present your credit card to the driver at the time Pizza Hut delivers your order for a credit card imprint and your signature.)"
EDIT: I got my pizza 
I just had to sign the receipt did not show a card or anything.

I got a email from Pizza Hut real quick after paying.

I assume they just find the closes place to your address. They picked a Pizza Hut just down the road from me. I should get a $15.00 pizza for $.99 in about 5 to 10 more min
EDIT: Arrived.
