Really, seemed like a lot to me.   What is a typical fee at a kiosk like this?   I always use online exchanges for any crypto purchase.

Yeah, well, I don’t buy from them, so I’m not losing out on anything.   I’m just bringing up the issue for new digital asset buyers.

What is the exchange fee on that one?
@_date: 2018-12-26 13:10:52
Yeah, I get that some exchanges charge 10-20 for a purchase, but that seems too much.   Not a good introduction to get new crypto investors excited about their purchase.

I don’t buy from these machines personally.  Just posted a new addition to my town.  Just thought it was overpriced for anyone just getting in to digital assets.  But the consensus is about 8-10% fee from these kiosks, from what I’ve gathered

$10-20 sorry for not clarifying, for depositing to an exchange.  Exchange fees are not much at all.   The the initial deposit or withdrawal fee is what I’m referring to

I like the sound of that.   Merry XRPmas

I found the video to be quite compelling.  It’s a little old, though still very relevant.   It also helps the average Joe understand the benefits of Crypto and Blockchain!

Tone is a dickweasel.  An X banker that bashes all crypto except BTC.  And the mofo doesn’t even trade.   Don’t understand how so many people follow this Dumb and Dumber look alike
