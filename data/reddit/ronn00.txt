Yes, i saw full texts. Nothing very special, imo. (If you saw full texts and JA response...) Go and read Podesta emails where clinton campaign directly coordinated with media to see what is actual collusion. Also JA was the one who inspired Trump Jr. to leak his russia releated emails and he asked him to leak Trump tax returns... Hope you understand that these DMs were not meant for public and they wrote it in style of why DJT Jr should do this. Now go and read full dms

7.Reclaiming Disk Space
Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before  it can be discarded to save disk space.  To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash,  transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash.  Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree.  The interior hashes do  not need to be stored.

SegWit transactions take less space, are chaper and SegWit block is max 2gb.
SegWit allows lightning network that makes transactions extra cheap and fast.
We don't need any other increases in blocksize, because we have to keep bitcoin decentralized and runnable at any home PC. So we have to save space.
@_date: 2017-08-10 19:03:52

This can be reached soon, if blocksize is increased (to 8mb :o), because of spammers. Bitcoin nodes should be operated BY THE PEOPLE not gov, corporations, merchants etc. Bitcoin is decentralized money and bitcoin system is owned by no-one. That's why we have to keep it decentralized. Otherwise, there's no reason for bitcoin to excist. It should be run by the people.

LTC isn't BTC. LTC is an altcoin, it's not as popular and used and important as bitcoin is. Bitcoin is intended to be decentralized.
There are also malicious spammers on BTC. If block size is increased, then normal people won't be able to run a node at home, so no decentralization.

@_date: 2017-08-20 20:10:13
What the fuck are you talking about.
There is no compromise. Not in this way
Bitcoin has to stay DECENTRALIZED. Do you understand what it means? 
So first of all Bitcoin Unlimited WHAAT???
Are you fuckin' MAD? Remember what happened... few months ago. Remember when boom! and half of BTU nodes disconnected (LOL) because someone made an attack. Code was vulnerable (and still is...)
Ha... remember that they thought Bitcoin needs prezident? Dolts...
And what is the problem with core? Open, decentralized, transparent, well tested development. These people know bitcoin better than anyone... they make bitcoin secure. Their nodes are what keep bitcoin running. And anyone can join, submit PR on githib, write BIP, submit to mailing list or just chat with all devs on IRC. 
Secoundly, here's what is decentralization:
When every supporter runs a node at home. On their raspberi PI or PC...whatever. When anyone can talk with devs, be dev or just propose ideas. When people have power. When there is no centralized power. (Like president LMAO) 
It currently is so, but there is a huge problem with miners. Bitmain, Jihan has too much power. Miners are just miners, they don't control btc.
But you know, these all S2X, 8MB ideas... it all makes blockchain bigger. It's already big. One thing is memory, other thing is net traffic. If we increase blocks, then average user won't be able to run a node at home. Do we want that?
Then nodes will be hosted on some servers, controlled by big corporations who will pay for them. Do we want that.
This won't be bitcoin. This is not what we want. Then there's no reason to support it. Bitcoin is DECENTRALIZED money. That's why it's popular. Not because of price, as investment.
You probably hold bitcoin for profits. You are not interested in technology. You don't know much.

Am i fucking understanding it right?
Am i on or am i on can't understand.
You have NO FUCKING CLUE about how bitcoin works, why it works, why it's decentralized and how it is to run a full node.
You fucktard are acting like some expert while you know nothing. And you attack actual experts who built bitcoin to what it is now.


You fuck-face don't fucking understand that IT'S A VERY BIG DEAL. To keep the bitcoin running NOT CRASHING. 1mb blocks are already big. First of all, memory. But that's not really the biggest problem. Biggest problem is network traffic and latency. It is huge right now with 1mb blocks. When blockchain gets bigger, it takes even more traffic and network becomes slower. You don't run a full node, you don't know how it is to run it. This one mb block is already big, when you have to send many blocks, hundreds of them, to many people. And receive them. And verify them.


Do you even know how bitcoin works? You are calling best developers in bitcoin, who literally built it babies?


You fucking moron, noone wins. Bigger blocks, huge blockchain that nobody can run at home, it is loss. It's not bitcoin anymore. 
Lightning network is for that. But you, i guess, don't even know what it is.
Don't you fucking understand that if we would just increase block size, we should have to do it again after some years, because bitcoin then will be 10x more popular?
The thing that you don't understand is that this is DECENTRALIZED money. Nodes make it decentralized. Nodes that run at home. They verify blockchain. They keep bitcoin safe. If nodes were run by big businesses, then updates like S2X would be so easy. Just make a deal with everybody.
But bitcoin is people's money. People control it.
That's why S2X will fail. Few shitnodes versus big network of Core nodes that run bitcoin network. This is what nodes are for.

Where tf are you going to use BCH? Maybe it has low fees, but why do you need them if you can't even use the coin? You can't spend it, noone accepts that shit. You can't invest into it (just look at what happened with price - EXTREME manipulation). Even if txes were complately free, why tf should you even use it?

Business. Fooling idiots. If bcash gets popular (that's what he's attempting. The goal is that you could use bitcoin wallets to send either bch or btc to any wallet and to make people think that they are pretty similar), so if it gets popular, he's very rich. He has invested huge ammounts of money into bch and he and his friends control it. He wants to get more rich.

@_date: 2017-09-29 15:55:59
You don't realise how bad it will get.
When 90% of hashrate will mine other chain that will be supported by most Bitcoin lightweight wallets. They won't even realise that they are using S2X chain, while Bitcoin chain will be frozen. 
We need to protect bitcoin. We need to act. This actually can be the end of the decentralized bitcoin. It can possibly succeed. Most bitcoin users know nothing about decentralization, consensus, core, decentralization and control. They won't even realise that they have switched to S2X chain. 
You may say that core runs 99% of network. In one moment, they can launch thousands of amazon node servers. They have enough money to do that.
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:40:48
Don't read one side arguments. Just read all about S2X. Read about what it is. Read what devs say about it. Understand it. Maybe you are new to this sub and bitcoin, you just won't understand it then.
@_date: 2017-09-10 18:36:50
I know it was revealed hours ago, but i don't see any frontpage post yet. Currently only price talks, NO2X and that kind of stuff is on the frontpage. I actually haven't seen other "Breaking Bitcoin" talk links on the frontpage either (sticky doesn't count). Does anybody care about it on Reddit? And what is worse - IT'S currently on top of the frontpage of that flat earther sub wtf. (And they attack Peter Todd for roasting JJ for irresponsible disclosure)
Basically this attack is capable of crashing a huge amount of Bitcoin nodes, but it's very expensive and takes a long time to be exploited. And is fixed on 0.15 core that will be released tomorrow. And nobody here knows that... bad... very bad.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:03:03
It's a terrible idea. It's not dip. It's crashing. And it's still crashing.
Is your goal to just buy bitcoins or buy MORE bitcoins? 
Read news. Wait til price becomes more stable. Wait a week. Maybe two. Wait til it actually starts growing. Wait til price starts actually increasing. 
Right now it's falling. Maybe it'll even fall to 2000$.
Also, maybe be like me. Be smart. Wait til S2X HF and when S2X will fail and miners will go back to normal bitcoin chain and buy

It could end this way:
Coinbase and all other biggest exchanges and bitcoin companies start using btc1 nodes. TPTB launch more btc1 nodes on amazon servers then there are core nodes. Lightweight wallets (most btc users i guess) start using S2X chain and receive btc from S2X chain (these wallets don't see difference between btc1 and bitcoin core nodes) 90% hashpower goes to S2X, so bitcoin chain freezes and most people spend their coins on S2X. (because they dont use full nodes) Core devs leave project. blows up. Price drops. Everyone sells. Satoshi wakes up and sells his 1M+ coins, thus crashes bitcoin market complately. End, bitcoin actually dies.
@_date: 2017-09-10 19:49:26
The problem is that you can't make bitcoin decentralized by decentralizing nodes. You know why?
Look at core, core has a very decentralized development. Anyone can contribute, anyone can talk on IRC. Anyone can suggest. (flat earthers won't believe)
Now look at other nodes. They have much less users, but do they have a decentralized development? Some may have, i don't know.
The only way how some node could overtake Core would be if it was developed by some good company with a very good codebase and good features. Also, these are the only reasons why people would use it.
Most of random developers and contributors would choose most popular and used node software - Core. Why should they contribute to others.
But what if some company developed so good node software that it became very popular?
If it would be used by more than 50% of nodes, it could easily make hard forks, update rules, And so on.. This company would have a huge control over bitcoin. Do we want it?
Okay, let's say there were 2 company full nodes and 1 core node popular. These 2 company nodes can just make a deal and decide rules for themselves.
And it's a huge problem, because these companies would have actual control over bitcoin. Currently bitcoin core controls network NOT MINERS. Bitcoin core's control is decentralized.
However i'd be okay, if 20% of nodes would be other than Bitcoin Core. They wouldn't have control, but could help securing bitcoin. It they are more than 50%, then R.I.P bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:37:14
Sell. Maybe wait 1-2 weeks and sellit when it's price is higher. After November you can buy back. I'm pretty sure that if Bitcoin will manage to survive, then it's price will be much lower. And then you can hodl your btc peacefully.

WikiLeaks publishes very rarely. They have to check authenticity for everything. It is possible that they have info, but haven't released it yet. As much i have been following, i know that WikiLeaks has yet to publish:
1) Google email leak (announced on January)
2) Huge part of Vault7 (If first release wasn't even 1%, they have more than they have released yet and they haven't published new tools for a long time)
3) CIA media operations (announced with insurance file before summer)
4) Other parts of Russian Spy files (before a month they only released first part)
And there is a lot more to be published. When WL released many insurance files last year, file names were pretty interesting and unrelated to any of what i mentioned.
What i mean with this is that their job is slow, publishing is slow. If they received some Trump leak now, they would probably publish it only after a half year. It's slow process. You know, all verification, analysis and research. And they have never published a fake document.

Replace Russia with Israel and you may realise something. 
Also pizzagate got popular not because of AJ. And it's not just a dumb theory. If you know something about it.

I think it was government attention. Also he understood that he has to hide, because of government interest in him

No i'm not butthurt. You don't understand it. I could try to explain to you, but it's worthless.
No, it's not market that needs bigger blocks. Also bitcoin is decentralized trustless p2p cash system, not PayPal with BTC currency mark FYI. You know nothing about BTC. It's just an investment for you.

2x is a blocksize Hard Fork that will increase blocksize to 4-8mb. It will happen on November and will be forced by miners, community and devs dislike it. It will also be rejected by most nodes, but all lightweight btc wallets will accept it. 90% of hashrate will leave bitcoin chain and start to mine s2x chain

This way bitcoin will become a PayPal with Bitcoin currency. Basically all reason for it to excist is lost then. Sorry.

It's a terrible idea. It's not dip. It's crashing. And it's still crashing.
Is your goal to just buy bitcoins or buy MORE bitcoins? 
Read news. Wait til price becomes more stable. Wait a week. Maybe two. Wait til it actually starts growing. Wait til price starts actually increasing. 
Right now it's falling. Maybe it'll even fall to 2000$.
Also, maybe be like me. Be smart. Wait til S2X HF and when S2X will fail and miners will go back to normal bitcoin chain and buy

First of all you are moron and you are uninformed. There's no extradition order to Sweden anymore. Sweden ended investigation. Also UN had proven that Sweden's extradition order was illegal. Also, Sweden has extradited to US in all cases ever (when US asked). 
Second of all, there was secret extradition order to US prepared and there was secret charges written.

YOU can use VPN/TOR but 99.9% of network won't, thus can be monitored. Do we want a monitored network? We need it to be private for everybody and secure from state level actors.

How do you feel about your greatest president giving tax cuts for rich, instead of middle class. How do you feel about your great president allowing weapon deals with Saudi Arabia? (that is killing Yemen people) How do you like that he's working in Isreael interests, that his main advisor is Isreal shill? That he's trying to create new wars in middle east? That he betrayed his supporters and forget about his "promises"

Only two WL unrelated conclusions and only one is right. You are a moron, sad to see.
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:19:58
At least he hasn't started a war in Syria yet. Like Clinton would have.
Anyways, the fact that Trump is US prez isn't something why you should hate WikiLeaks. Do you really think WikiLeaks should publish a leak only if it doesn't hurt political side they support? I personally would hate WikiLeaks if they rejected a leak because of political opinion.

IIRC there are 2 types of locktime txses.
First is when tx is announced and accepted when timelock passes. It may have to be rebroadcasted later, but you can still change TX til that time.
Second is a type where TX is put into block, but it can't be spent til timelock time passes.

Yeah so now a journalist, a truth teller, someone who exposes how something really was is peace of shit? For what? For publishing truth? For publishing raw authentic emails that proven corruption? And because other president candidate won because many people didn't like corruption and hillary's (and her team's) own words. Now you hate the publisher. Sad. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:14:12
Those people who hate WikiLeaks, love mainstream media are not suited for Bitcoin. These people aren't libertarians, they wouldn't support the technology. Maybe only as investment

I see it as a network vulnerability. Maybe nodes should have anti-spam protection or something like that... like limits: TX/node/hour
And maybe nodes should have some mechanism how to detect spam TXes and remove them from the mempool.
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:06:54
I'm pretty sure that if MSM weren't corrupted and would expose not only Trump, but also Clinton and if there weren't CTR shills before elections, WikiLeaks would still be supported by Reddit's liberals. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 07:57:28
Yeah no side is smarter. Also, btw, talking about pizzagate, noone said that hillary is running pedo ring. Maybe hillery is little involved. What they did find was that Ping pong pizzeria's owner is probably a pedo and that Podesta may be pedo as well. You haven't seen the proof. Most threads were on (banned) and pics on sli.mg (down)
And by the way, better be some conspiracy theorist autist that also knows some truth, not msm zombie that doesn't think along at all and thinks what he has to think.

He has huge credibility actually!
Also, in real life, if he did what you said, he'd be arrested, then extradited to U.S, then sent to secret court. Afrer that he'd put in maximal security secret prison, tourtured by CIA that would use all info to take down WikiLeaks. And noone would hear about him any more, ever.

He hid because of government interest in bitcoin that WL could have created. He understood that he has to hide.

See, you are the moron. You are the misinformed one. No he isn't running away because of sexual crimes. He isn't runing away.
First of all, he didn't do any sexual crimes. This is another story, long story, but summary is that charges were dropped and girls who charged wanted fame (police was involved too) Main goal was to get him to Sweden and then extradited to US because of Diplomatic cables that WikiLeaks leaked.
But Sweden wanted him "for questioning", so there was extradition order to Sweden. (While in reality, the goal was to get him to Sweden and then extradite him to US - US had secret extradition order to US, he'd get arrested. (that document was leaked later) Also Sweden has extradited to US every other who they were asked to)
That is why Assange hid in embassy.
Basically what happened some time before summer (don't remember exact month) was that Sweden stopped investigation and dropped extradition order to Sweden. So is he free? No, UK police told that they will arrest him if he goes out. Official reason was that he hid from police or court, i can't remember. While in reality there is a new secret extradition order to US sent to UK, and that's the real reason why he's still in embassy. And UK has spent more than 11M pounds for police be around the embassy.
And then you have morons on internet who really think he's hiding for rape or something like that.
And what if he stepped outside? He'd be immediately extradited to US. Judged in secret court. Put in maximal security prison and most likely tortured by CIA. But we wouldn't hear about him anymore after he stepped outside.
