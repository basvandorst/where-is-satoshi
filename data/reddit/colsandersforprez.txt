Why though? It's so important because they are leeching off the brand. If their project was superior then they could call it Shitcoin Pro and it would win. They are desperate to dick ride our success for a reason.

Hypocrisy. You hate "Bcash" but you know we hate when you call it "Bitcoin Core".
I know what people are trying to do with this name shift. This is what you wish it was like:
Bitcoin -&gt; Bitcoin Core
Bcash -&gt; Bitcoin Cash
This is reality:
Bitcoin -&gt; Bitcoin
Bitcoin Cash -&gt; Bcash -&gt; Shitcoin
Sorry if that offends anyone.

We don’t need Bitcoin to be like cash just yet. We need to be our own bank first. There is no crisis with buying coffee. There is a crisis with our central banks. Kill the banks first. Then we can kill Visa and PayPal.

Yes, also cars are generally a good thing but some of them suck dick and are pieces of shit.

You can duct tape the Bitcoin blockchain to any shitcoin you want but it won't be any more special for it.

Then why care what we call it? Bcash backers are so desperate to call it Bitcoin because they know the name is doing most of the heavy lifting. Without the Bitcoin in Bcash it would be just another shitcoin. Now it's just a highly over-valued shitcoin.

Bitcoin's value is based on its utility. Bitcoin has utility because fiat has failed us on large scales, not because it's difficult to buy coffee with fiat. You don't need to "be your own bank" to buy coffee. People worried about cheap payments are missing the point. That will come eventually but it's not the biggest part of Bitcoin's demand right now.
