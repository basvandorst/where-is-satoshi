Hey, lets hope!

Yeah, went up to 25k this morning. Jumping all over the place, ha! 
I'm not fussed though to be honest. A lot of people panic selling - and to be fair, if I had so much money as to worry about losing it, thus inducing a panic sale, I would panic sale to. But I'm not banking on enough to worry about the possible loss. 
This correction was always bound to happen - as the last correction did. And it will go up again soon. Maybe tomorrow, maybe next month, maybe in a year or two - but it'll go up again.

Oh I certainly intend to keep the bitcoins as bitcoins. The idea is that the non bitcoin payments should cover the production costs of the items paid by Bitcoin (for the time being anyway). So there technically shouldn't be a need to transfer the Bitcoins to cash. But It's good to know I have the option if it's required. 
Etsy doesn't have Bitcoin payment options implemented. So far, the best solution the Bitcoin Etsy community has come up with is to get the buyer to select "other" as a form of payment, then I as the seller contact the buyer with the invoice and an address to send the Bitcoins to. Once the transaction is confirmed, I then mark the order as "paid" and continue on as normal.

Investing in crypto currencies is inherently NOT financially beneficial. In that crypto is extremely volatile. You could put in $500 today, and tomorrow is could easily be worth $10. Or the opposite way, $1000. Who knows. Crypto currencies are currently very high risk, for high reward.
With that said;
If you do want to invest $500 (assuming that you're completely and totally fine with potentially NEVER seeing that $500 EVER again....) you should spend $100 of that $500 to get a hardware wallet. Do some research on:
Ledger Nano S
These are the "big 3" hardware wallets. These will store your private key "off-grid" so that it minimizes the risk of having your cryptos stolen. 
Once you have that, sign up at an exchange. Coinbase, BTCMarkets, bittrex etc... Go through the verification process then purchase some crypto currencies. Again, at this stage, when you purchase you must completely and fully comprehend the likely idea that you won't ever see that $500 (now $400 due to the purchase of the hardware wallet) again. It could just disappear like that...
Bitcoin is seeing some heavy gains right now. No one knows why. Though the speculation is that either people are buying up in preparation for Bitcoin shorting on December 8th and 18th. Or South Koreans are transferring their wealth to bitcoin in preparation for war - or a combo of both... 
Most other crypto currencies aren't doing too much. 
There's no way for people here to tell you have to make money on this, because again, this is highly speculative and could all go bust at any moment. 
Good luck!

Ah, great! Thanks for the tip. I'll investigate! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:41:21
It already has, depending on what currency you're going by.

Shell is a great leather to work with. Though at times it can be tricky as (you would know this) you need to protect the Shell more so than other leathers, atleast until its complete. 
I use it in combination with kangaroo for my wallets. I find that the Shell that cordovan.co offer is a little thicker than I like, but don't want to split it, so using kangaroo on the interior of the wallet allows me to keep a reasonbly thing wallet!

Kangaroo holds up brilliantly in the long run. I also build my wallets with a buy it for life mandate, so I totally get you! I've made close to around 4000 kangaroo wallets, I have not had a single one returned because the leather has busted. So long as you stick to a few key rules with any leather, you can't go wrong! 
Yeah it'll be an interesting challenge to incorporate the new payment systems with the "old". Ironically, the more that crypto is adopted, the greater the chances of me going out of business as a need for conventional wallets decreases - however this brings a nice middle ground!

I should note that this particular tannery shown in this screen shot is not one of the oldest tanneries in operation, but rather the business of tanning leather is one of the oldest forms of business.

No, this isn't Horween. This is Cordovan.co (although also known by Rocado)
@_date: 2018-10-18 22:17:21
3 month wait? Holy doolly! That's huge! 
Try out Cordovan.co, see how you like it? 
I source my kangaroo from two Australian sites (I'm lucky that I'm Australian, as it's quite cheap for me). But try [Birdsalls]( and [Packer leather](
