Shit that sounds a lot like when we went from gold to IOUs in the old days.

Not gonna happen. PayPal is the main way of payment for a ton of people. If I stop using them I lose more than half my salary.

I agree, he lost me halfway through.

I doubt it, as long as people get paid in fiats that's what they will spend. Even if you get paid in both it's smarter to spend the fiat which has higher inflation and keep BTC as investment.

Sure there is, you can trade in all kinds of things, but a low inflation currency is the last thing you want to exchange for goods.

Sounds more like an investment than money

It's not the only one, GDPR is an overreach of centralized power, I totally get why US websites aren't complying and instead blocks EU visitors.

Unless you have no high inflation currency on hand, that's pretty poor financial planning.

Sadly the community won't do anything until the homeless are dying in the street. Giving money to pan handlers creates a market for it though. Personally I'd like to see increased taxes on my income to have the city take care of them than force them into one of the  shittiest job on earth ( pan handling ).

That's the great separation in ideology. I see society as a collective which I am apart of. Libertarians view it as something other people are a part of. Besides how would I go about consulting everyone in society? I'm just saying I would like a society where all of us collectively help the poor get on their feet. I'm not saying others can't disagree with my views.

All of us needs to do it as a collective or its too expensive. We got 2 million homeless now right? I can't pay for all that myself.

I just hate them because they don't reply to emails about your account, 5 months of waiting for me and still nothing.

Tell me about it. I've read about bit coin sporadically for 2 years and I still don't understand how to setup a safe wallet. And I'm considered more tech savvy than the average joe. Is coin base a bad idea?

Kind of sounds like if I paid for the road, I could just ask anyone for a toll if they want to use it. That's way more harmful to the free market than having the roads serve everyone.

The reason we group together to buy stuff is to get better prices at bulk. Facilities can squeeze the individual much easier than the government which they have to corrupt first.

People like to talk about Bitcoin as internet money, but it's more like internet gold at the moment. It has high transfer fees and is an investment due to it's volatility, but most of all it's an investment due to the lack of inflation. 
See it like this, if you get paid in two currencies and one of them is volatile but likely to not inflate and you have another currency that is losing value each year. Which currency would you hold and which one would you use to buy goods for? 
Ironically if Bitcoin is dropping in value, you'll see more people spend it quicker. The better it does, the less people use it.
As for stability, it's likely to stabilize eventually. Feels like there is a crypto bubble at the moment.

Why wouldn't you want to pay tax on it?

Alright calm down Cathy Newman, he is saying that saving is done once consumption needs have been met.

He was so hot in Sweden that a government official told him to "crawl back from under the rock he came from", and a party leader discussed equality of outcome with him on national TV. He is probably more known in European countries that don't dub their media though, no doubt.
