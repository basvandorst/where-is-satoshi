I don't think so, I really can't see him doing that.
I think it's more of what pb1x said... they didn't have much of a case against him and since the AG made such a big deal out of it they wanted to ensure a conviction to make an example out of him.  Also probably didn't want to risk him winning and setting some kinda precedent for other bitcoin sites.  
And he took the deal because even if he was sure he could win it would've cost him more money than that to fight - so might as well pay the fine and guarantee no jail time.
He also had the best lawyers possible, so that helps.

Seals With Clubs was the old site, the one this case involves that was closed in February.
The new site, SwCpoker, is still running and will continue to do so.
Micon stepped back from SwCpoker a couple months ago to deal with this and it's being run by other team members.

Used this machine a few months ago for the first time.  It is in a great location and the artwork looks pretty cool.
Best part was that while I was at the machine an older woman walked over and asked "so, what is bitcoin?"  I got to have a short conversation with her and answer some questions... she seemed interested and said she'd look in to it.
Agree that some videos playing or brochures would help.

Although it sucks to be forced to plead guilty to something when you don't believe you are guilty, I'm happy for Micon that he was able to resolve this and remain free.
Good luck going forward getting this finished up and put behind you.

Just a heads up that BTCpay does have LN implemented.  Been accepting lightning payments through ours for a couple weeks and it's awesome.  [Video Demo](
Agree that it's not quite ready for a small store that doesn't have experience with bitcoin yet though.  But it's getting there.  BTCpay does have the [simple POS page]( already that you could have on a tablet in store.  
Right now you still have to interact with c-lightning through command line... not too mom &amp; pop that are new to bitcoin friendly.  But they're working on it.

I feel you that it doesn't make sense for delays in cash deposits.
A couple weeks ago at 9pm I noticed my account was going to be barely short after an automatic withdrawal was due to come out just after midnight... so I went to the ATM and deposited a $20 to cover it.
Turns out that even cash deposits to an ATM after 8pm don't post until the next day.  So the auto withdrawal came before the deposit was processed and I got hit with a $35 overdraft.
Obviously my fault for being bad at math and not being prepared.  But still... waiting until the next day to credit cash deposits seems really outdated.

Might depend on your bank... but the few times I've withdrawn it's showed up in my account at midnight on the second business day.
So in your example, if I sold Monday it would be available at midnight on Tuesday night/Wednesday morning.
@_date: 2014-07-12 02:15:25
Yeah that's right, the [DOJ said that poker doesn't apply to the wire act]( so there aren't any federal laws against it.
The UIGEA made it illegal for banks to knowingly process gambling transactions.  And like you said, the payment processors that got arrested after Black Friday were charged with faking credit card charges to hide that it was going to a poker site.
So a poker site using bitcoin to deposit/withdraw shouldn't violate any federal gabling laws.  And the UIGEA doesn't apply because there aren't any banks involved.  
@_date: 2018-05-26 00:27:43
Yeah, it looks like the countdown was at 19:46 when "Pay" is selected and then at 19:40 when it confirms.
Not too bad for a multi-hop transaction between 3 different LN implementations.

Right.  Coinbase doesn't want to do this, or anything else that costs them business.

Seals definitely has potential to help spread bitcoin adoption thru poker players, especially Americans.
I first heard of bitcoin from other libertarians when it was at $5, but dismissed it without researching because I didn't see what I could personally use it for.  
Then someone told me about Seals and that's what got me to actually research and then first buy bitcoin.  So I owe them for that.  
About the site - the most important thing to a US player is that over the almost 2 years I've been there my withdrawals have always been processed within 12 hours.
The player pool is smaller compared to some fiat sites open to US players, but is by far the largest of the bitcoin sites.  And I think the overall softness of the games and the ability to withdraw within hours makes up for the smaller pool.

SealsWithClubs is the oldest and largest bitcoin poker site.  I've been playing there for a year now and I trust them more than any other sites available to Americans.
Here's their 186 page thread on BitcoinTalk:
For legality I'm not exactly sure.  In the US there aren't any clear federal laws against online poker.
The sites that were shut down on Black Friday got in trouble for trying to bypass the banking rules against "online gambling" transactions.  
But since bitcoin sites don't deal with banks they don't need to use 3rd party processors or attempt to conceal that they are processing "gambling" transactions.
Either way I wouldn't really worry about it right now.  I can't see the DOJ coming down on a relatively small bitcoin only poker site instead of the larger fiat sites that have continued to run since Black Friday.

From this tweet it looks like they set up a separate online store that takes bitcoin.  There are only a handful of items but I guess it's a start.
@_date: 2014-01-17 10:59:06
I would rather just get rid of legal tender laws.
Legal tender laws mean that if someone owes you a debt you have to either accept payment from them in the "legal tender" or forgive the debt.
As much as I love Bitcoin it would be wrong to force people to accept it as payment of debts - the same as forcing them to accept FRNs.
I think though that you may have meant that you want Bitcoin to be openly acknowledged as completely legal.  On that I would agree.  
We know that Bitcoin isn't "illegal" but it would help any businesses that are still hesitant and afraid of what the government may decide in the future.

I agree with you that Pokerstars should technically be able to accept bitcoin deposits from US players because it wouldn't violate the UIGEA... and the DOJ has said that poker doesn't apply to the wire act and isn't itself illegal.
But, I don't think Pokerstars will take the risk.  They're trying to get back in to the regulated US markets and wouldn't want to do anything that could keep them from getting a license.
Accepting bitcoin from the rest of the world would still be great for both poker and bitcoin though.  
It makes more sense for the sites that are currently taking Americans like Bovada to start using bitcoin.  They're already taking the legal risks and it would solve their problem of trying to process deposits and withdrawals through shady payment processors.
Hopefully if Pokerstars does it first and proves that it works the rest of the poker industry will follow.

They're not from a big market like New York or LA, and they don't have a winning history, but I think struggling is a little strong.
They're 25-16 so far... not too bad.  
And they're always near the top in attendance numbers.  Even during their losing years they sold out.  Last year they were 5th in average attendance and they're 5th so far this year.
They're also ranked the 8th most valuable franchise at $555 million.
I agree that it's not as big as if the Heat or Knicks started accepting Bitcoin, but hopefully the other teams will see what the Kings and Warriors are doing and feel like they need to keep up.

That's right.  Other than in a few states, even if you were playing for USD inside the US it would not be illegal.
There's no federal law that makes playing online poker illegal.  And even in the few states that have laws against it (like Washington), they have never actually gone after a player.

Yeah, updates in the past have come to Bodog first and then Bovada so I'm hoping that's the case here.  
Would have been nice if they had given that answer, but there's a good chance the support member wouldn't know about it yet anyway so I wouldn't read too much in to their answer.
Once they get it set up and running there's no reason for them not to also add it to the American side.  There's more incentive for them to use Bitcoin on Bovada than Bodog.

Bitcoin has had a positive affect on my life and I'm very thankful to have found it.
I had given up playing poker in 2011 after Black Friday because I didn't want to deal with waiting weeks/months to receive withdrawal checks... if they came at at all.
Then someone suggested SealsWithClubs and Bitcoin.  If it hadn't been for bitcoin I wouldn't have gotten back in to playing poker.  Not only did it allow me to regain a source of income, it has given me the freedom to do something I believe I have the right to do - whether the government likes it or not.
@_date: 2016-06-06 22:58:48
They have every poker game variant you could want... Holdem, Omaha, Stud, Draw, Mixed Games, Chinese, etc.
Most important to me, out of the dozens of sites I've played on over the last 13 years they are by far at the top of the list for caring about the players.  If something goes wrong while you're playing and you lose money they will make it right.

No, the old Seals With Clubs voluntarily closed and paid out balances in full.
Some of the members from that team decided to go forward with the new software they had been working on and opened SwC Poker in early 2015.
If you had an account on the old site you can still recover it and use it on SwC.
@_date: 2016-06-01 02:27:48
You might have to verify your ID.  It's pretty simple though.
They're still a standard fiat site, so the same rules apply of only allowing one account per player... which means they might ask for info to make sure you don't have multiple accounts, weren't previously banned, and are over 18.
@_date: 2016-06-01 07:37:16
They don't display the number of players currently online or playing... but they run poker tournaments that get well over 1k players.
They're the 3rd largest poker network in the world behind Pokerstars and 888.
And that doesn't even include the people that are just sports bettors or slots/table game players.  So it seems safe to assume the number of recently active accounts is easily in the 5 figures, maybe even 6.

Bovada.lv, not Brovada
Bovada is the U.S. facing skin of the Bodog network.  Bodog has been around since 2000.  Bovada's sports lines are referenced by media like ESPN.

Agree.  Bitcoin is perfectly made for sites like this that offer poker to US players.  There were a small group of us that have been lobbying Bovada to accept bitcoin for a couple years.  
Kind of funny that back then other players dismissed it and said bitcoin was too crazy and nobody would use it.  
Today it's quickly becoming the preferred option.  I've helped dozens of people get set up and the general consensus is "wow, bitcoin is awesome, why would anyone deposit/withdraw with one of the other methods".

If anything Nevada should be bringing Micon and the owners/operators of Seals in to teach them the way an online poker site should be run.
Many sites with much larger budgets and famous names have come and gone due to incompetence or outright theft.  Seals had a history of always doing it right.
There were no victims of Seals With Clubs.  This wasn't UB/AP/Full Tilt/Lock Poker etc.  Micon was no Russ Hamilton/Scott Tom/Howard Lederer/Ray Bitar etc.  He wasn't even the one in charge.
Good luck Micon.
@_date: 2015-04-30 23:24:51
Hey, thanks for the updates.  
You nailed it with that line.  For people unfamiliar with Micon and SealsWithClubs they might not understand the "Chairman" sarcasm.  
Here is what the old SealsWithClubs Team Pro page looked like:
I think after seeing that most people can tell that the stuff on there about Micon creating and coding things for the site were meant as a joke... in the style of Kim Jong Il inventing the hamburger and controlling the weather.
@_date: 2015-04-28 07:11:13
That's a good point.  Micon didn't start Seals and he wasn't in charge - but I can't imagine him giving up the identity of the people that were in order to clear himself.
It would be interesting to know what their case is, and how much of it is just based on him being the only known public face of Seals.  But even if he knows that he *should* be able to win I don't know if it's a risk worth taking.
Hopefully his lawyer is able to work something out.

Not sure how Airbitz flew under my radar for so long, but since finding it awhile back I've been a huge supporter.
It's the perfect mix of being super easy to use for everyone, while still being secure and giving you control of your bitcoin.
I recently had a friend that had no experience with Bitcoin download the app and sent him a few bucks worth... and then had him try sending some back.  
His reaction was "Wow, that's it?  That's so easy"... and now he's diving in to learn everything he can about Bitcoin.

Has a few moments that can be forgiven because it is a TV show... but overall they did a pretty good job.  Especially for a network TV show made in 2011.  You can tell the writers actually knew about Bitcoin.
I'd recommend checking it out, you can find it online.
@_date: 2015-04-29 22:22:14
Thanks for the article and for helping to get the word out.
I just wanted to make clear that Micon wasn't the founder of SealsWithClubs though.  The founder was known as "FreeMoney" on BitcoinTalk, and Micon didn't come along until some time later.
Micon also doesn't have anything to do with the current withdrawals from the old SealsWithClubs website.  They're still being processed by the SealsWithClubs team and you have until May 5th to withdraw before they cease operations.
The new site that Micon did launch, SwCpoker.eu, will still continue.
@_date: 2015-04-29 00:38:08
Yes.  Aside from the argument that the law is bogus is that Micon wasn't even the one running the site.  He was just the spokesman/site pro/marketing guy.  
They went after him because he was the only person from Seals that was publicly known.  The agent that investigated wrote that his research was based on visiting the website and seeing Micon "prominently displayed" as the lead pro.  
He also seems to have taken literally the jokes about Micon being called the "Chairman" and being responsible for bringing an Android version and other things to the site. (On a page that had pictures of Micon's head Photoshopped on Kim Jong Il's body)

They've been around for years, so it would seem odd for them to intentionally steal your btc now.
Have you sent them an email to see what's up?
@_date: 2015-03-02 08:32:23
Yeah, you're right.
I was part of the group beta testing the client and the plan was to slowly open it up to more people over time, which would've given them time to develop the other versions before launching.
But since they didn't feel comfortable using the old software anymore the decision was that it was more important to open now with PC only than to wait.  
The new client is really cool and they can do a lot more with it vs the old software, so I think it should hopefully be a quicker process.
@_date: 2015-03-21 08:43:23
I don't know the details of their deal, he may have paid them.  But yeah they transferred control/rights to the new software to him.
In their statement they say:
"As the majority ownership &amp; team will not go forward with operations but Micon is still in a position to do so, it makes the most sense to hand off assets to Micon in order to enable him to provide to our players the best Bitcoin poker experience he can."

I don't know much more than what's there.  Seals had an unknown problem with their server in Romania on the 11th, and the same morning Micon's house was raided by Nevada Gaming Control.
No arrests or charges, but they took his electronics.  
The old Seals management decided that they didn't want to continue running the site, and that it was unknown whether the old software was still safe to use.
Micon did want to continue so they gave him the new software and he moved to Antigua to open SwC.

They seem to have fully bought in to the benefits of bitcoin.  From the emails I've seen posted they are recommending bitcoin withdrawals as the preferred method now.
There are a lot of poker players and sports bettors that are using bitcoin for the first time over the last few weeks.

You don't need an affiliate code to get RB, everyone has the same rakeback program.
You earn krill while playing (like frequent player points), and as you reach higher krill levels you get larger rakeback percentages.
Plus everyone automatically gets 50% rakeback when playing 2 or 3 handed at tables with 6 or more seats.

@_date: 2016-05-06 03:53:45
Thanks for the report for other new players.
Yeah, since they are still a standard fiat site they do go by the normal rules of one account per player and stuff.  And in order to do that they need to verify ID.
@_date: 2015-03-21 05:10:14
Yeah, they have almost every game you could want to play.  
Just so that people make sure they are going to the right site though, it is SwCpoker.eu instead of .com 
@_date: 2015-03-02 05:15:08
Not yet, but it should be added eventually.
@_date: 2016-05-06 22:32:26
Yeah, it is a pretty big deal.  Bovada is the largest online poker site available to US players, and the 3rd largest in the world.
This is one of the rare cases where a company adopts bitcoin because it will actually help their current customers - not to attract business from bitcoiners or get publicity.
With other methods Bovada offers 1 free withdrawal a month, and $50 each after that.  Those withdrawals would take anywhere from a week to a couple months.  Sometimes checks ended up bouncing or their payment processor was shut down... costing them money and delaying everyone's withdrawals.
With bitcoin they can now offer free withdrawals, you can do one once every 5 days, and they arrive within 2 days from request.  Mine took a day and a half.
That's a huge incentive for the thousands of current customers to learn about bitcoin and start using it.

Good article, thanks for writing and getting the word out that SwC is alive.  I've seen a lot of people saying "didn't they close?"
As a note though, Micon is now the owner of the new SwC... but he wasn't the owner of SealsWithClubs.  SealsWithClubs had been devolping this new software and when the old owners decided to close they gave it to Micon to continue on with the launch of SwC.

In the BTC Talk thread Micon posted:
*PC only for a bit, then we'll build the others. 
no iphone, obv.
browser would be html5 likely, and also likely after all the other clients.
Basically get or emulate a PC for the SwCPoker launch, it's the only way I can serve you guys bitcoin poker for now, but I promise the platform build out will go fast.*

I agree that I wouldn't want to leave my money on a site that can be shut down.  We all learned that lesson the hard way.
That's the benefit of using bitcoin though.  Deposits and withdrawals are quick, easy and free... so you don't have to keep any significant amount of money the site.  
You can deposit and withdraw every time you play if you want to and keep nothing on the site.  
That's not an endorsement of this particular site by the way... not sure if they're legit or not.  Just a general statement about bitcoin poker.
@_date: 2016-05-31 23:51:58
Yep.  And they're also the largest poker site open to US players, and the 3rd largest in the world.

Huge thanks for putting this guide together.  I've been wanting to try BTCPay for a long time, and after seeing your link to BTCPayJungle I was able to get set up using their server in minutes.
I wasn't familiar with them before, but it looks like a great option to be able to test and then later decide if you want to set up your own server.
BTCPay now live on 
After testing and getting the hang of it the next step will be setting up a server and adding lightning.
@_date: 2015-02-23 00:29:08
Right.  Some think Micon was secretly the founder, FreeMoney.  I love Micon, and he's a really smart guy so I mean this with all respect... he wouldn't have been able to create and run the site himself.  He wasn't the one doing all the technical stuff.
That's why I don't think he was ever hiding anything.  Being a public spokesperson/site pro/employee wouldn't be illegal... even IF it were determined the poker site was.

Here are a couple tweets from reporter that got a statement from NGCB:

Yeah, withdrawals are still going smoothly.
Mine, and most others, only took a few hours.  They do it in batches so it might be longer for others but every report I've seen is less than 24 hours.

I definitely understand.  I had my whole bankroll on Full Tilt and UB on Black Friday.  Knocked me out of poker for a long time.
I didn't play online again until I found Seals, and that's actually what got me to finally research and buy bitcoin.
Now playing on Seals or WPN with bitcoin I don't really worry about a Black Friday or Lock Poker situation.  There's no reason to keep any money on the sites... so if they disappeared tomorrow I wouldn't be affected.
I obviously respect where you're coming from though.  I hope it's totally legal some day soon too.  Full Tilt/Pokerstars legally operating in the US and running ads on TV will be so juicy.
@_date: 2015-02-07 22:48:49
Yep, been playing on SwC for over 2 years without any problems.  
They have a solid reputation, put security first, withdrawals have always been quick, refunds when there are connection issues, etc.

I believe you need to do at least a minimum bitcoin deposit in order for the withdrawal option to show up for you.

Strange.  Haven't heard of anyone else getting an email like that after withdrawing.
Was the amount in the email the same as what you got in your withdrawal?

He didn't handle the withdrawals and stuff so I don't believe that he even had the player funds, or access to them.

@_date: 2013-11-26 23:40:20
Yep, I agree.  "Hoarding" is just a bad word for savings... which contrary to what Keynesians would have you believe is actually a good thing.
Central banks intentionally inflate fiat currency and lower interest rates to 0% in order to punish savers.  We can see where that has led us today... a "recession" with people spending every dollar and going deeper in debt.
Real economic growth comes when people have savings.  When people have money saved it signals to businesses that it's a good time to invest in future expansion because people will have the means to purchase their new product when it's built.

If they could get away with it, they might.  But governments don't usually make big changes like that all at once.  That allows people to feel the change and resist.  They do it gradually over time.  
People have grown up with and like paper bills.  If the government tried to eliminate cash there would be backlash.  They can't even quit making pennies because people are emotionally attached.  
But over time people have and will continue to use more electronic forms of money and less cash.  As today's kids grow up they will be less emotionally attached to paper/coins and not using cash will be normal.

Can the government easily track income of a business that accepts cash?
@_date: 2013-11-01 11:08:44
I understand how people can think this at first.  But I don't think it will be a problem.
For one, you could keep holding instead of spending - but if you never spent them they wouldn't really be worth anything.  Having a million dollars in bitcoin savings wouldn't make much sense if you're hungry and your shoes have holes in them.  
Eventually you're going to spend some on things that you need, or even just want.  
Even if you knew for sure that the value was going to steadily rise you still might decide that the goods/services you desire today are worth more to you than the increased buying power later.  The time is worth more than the money.
I do think it may cause people to spend their money more wisely though.  But I think that's a good thing.  All spending isn't equal.  More money will go to desirable, productive areas and less will be wasted on things that aren't really needed/wanted/most efficient.

Awesome, procrastinating finally pays off... now I don't feel as bad about waiting til the last minute to buy those gift cards for Christmas.
I love Gyft.  Thanks for the free points, for helping me turn Bitcoins in to pizza and beer, and for everything you do to promote Bitcoin.
While I was looking at the selection I was wondering if you guys would ever offer a "Gyft" gift card - where I could buy say a $50 Gyft card and then the person I give it to can choose which store's card they want?

There are a few, but Seals With Clubs is by far the biggest.  I'm actually playing there right now.
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:16:08
Maybe I'm just lucky, but I've also never had a problem buying or selling with Coinbase.  
Back when I made my first purchase in March the price had jumped between my order and when the bitcoin would arrive.  I had read about them cancelling orders so I was worried they'd cancel because of the increased value but it showed up right on time.  The same thing happened again in April.
I feel bad for people that have problems and get their orders cancelled, and I do agree that Coinbase should improve in that area.  
But I think the reason we see so many posts with complaints is because people are more likely to post about something going wrong than when everything works the way it should.
@_date: 2013-11-26 08:54:06
Definitely Seals With Clubs for poker.  
I like [BitcoinVideoCasino.com]( for the other games like blackjack and video poker.  It has the graphics and sounds of the retro Vegas machines so it's pretty cool if you're in to that.  
And both sites have an Android app too.

That's a thread about donating to a CoinJoin bounty.  The address collecting donations begins with the number 3.
Theymos posts about the address, "Not all wallet software supports addresses that being with 3. Bitcoin-Qt and Electrum support it, and I've heard that Coinbase also supports it. Any simple EWallet that uses Bitcoin-Qt directly should support it."
So I'm pretty sure what he's referencing that Coinbase supports is addresses that begin with a "3", and not CoinValidation.

Beep boop, doot doot!
I'd suggest checking out Coinbase.  That's what I use on my site and it's really easy to set up.
They'll take care of automatically making different addresses per transaction and calculating the current exchange rate so it's easier for you and the customer.
You can use that even if you want to keep the earnings as bitcoin.  And it's free.

What if you buy a PC for $500 using fiat money and then a few months later the store lowers the price to $300 to make room for a newer model?
Should you have waited to buy the PC because you know in the future it's price will be lower?
People buy things every day when they know they could get it for cheaper if they had waited.  But they would rather have it now and pay more.  So if someone has bitcoin and wants/needs a PC they may think it's worth it.
And that's not even counting the fact that after buying the PC bitcoin's value may drop, meaning you got a better deal.  It's only looking back after the fact and knowing that the bitcoin value has risen quickly can you say it was a bad decision.

There was an income tax long before computers or modern banking.  We also still had roads and bridges and education before then but I don't want to get off topic so I'll skip that argument.
If someone were paid in bitcoin it will work the same way it does now, it's up to the employer and employee to report.  Some may under-report, but that happens now anyways.  
Think of bitcoin as cash.  There are plenty of cash only businesses operating right now.
