Agreed, so stop thinking Bitcoin will make it to 2123 or whatever year the last coin gets mined...
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:43:17
It's also technically speaking one of the worst, why should it be the standard other than early adoption? 
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:39:32
It really depends on what you bought in at.  If you got in at a really low price who cares you're still way up.  All the people that bought at 19k probably don't feel the same way.
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:48:47
Not ones that bought above 10k and held....you have no idea the the average price is per coin that's out there right now.  You have no way to verify what you are saying is remotely true.
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:50:04
Maybe, maybe not.  At the point in the future at which dollars are no longer good, you'd probably be better off with bullets and freeze dried food than you would with anything else.  So why do people who've already made a killing think it's smart to keep holding?  I can't see that logic?  Is it simple greed?
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:05:01
hahahahahaha ok, what's your source for any of that?  Because based on this comment you don't understand shit about shit.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:07:15
Odd are that will never happen. I'm guessing bitcoin will be supplanted by something else we'll before all coins are mined. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:42:33
It can't but almost anyone can spin up a new crypto currency. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:42:41
Those will be fixed by another coin...
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:42:23
No, no it won't. It might force me to use a crypto currency, but the odds of it being bitcoin seem to be pretty slim. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:47:52
To what end?  If you really bought 3 years ago, when the price was under 1k you'd be an idiot to not take those profits and run.
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:45:26
liquidity isn't want makes something great for day trading, volatility is, and there's not much out there right now with more volatility than crypto.
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:16:36
Still have serious doubt bitcoin will survive in the long run. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:25:11
Good for you man, more power to you I say. Whatever makes you happy! 
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:44:07
Replace btc with crypto currency and I might agree.  There's no evidence BTC will be the defacto coin 10 or 20 or more years from now.
Also you do realize if everyone held the price would go nowhere right?
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:41:58
You're making an assumption that bitcoin will survive time. History is littered with dead currencies. I see no evidence bitcoin will survive long term. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 04:32:13
Should have sold when I told them to!
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:18:32
Right and the thought that the first crypto currency will somehow be the best is silly. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:45:56
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:05:21
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:41:02
If you have enough in to retire and never work again why not cash out?  That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.  Pigs get slaughtered man.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:03:41
Aren't a lot of people buying bitcoin on credit? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:11:38
All the more reason to sell, it's not like holding bitcoins gives them any power. They'd be better off with the cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:42:42
like a baby
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:12:46
Which makes no sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:41:13
hahahahahahahahaha I can't tell if your serious or not...you'd have to be a complete idiot to not sell some if it hits those levels.  Which it won't ever do.
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:05:06
Why not? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:58:00
Not 500 years from now. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:56:27
I did say I don't believe in the future of crypto currency. I just don't think it will be bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:25:45
Please let me know what I'm missing 
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:11:00
50 lifetimes is a long fucking time man. There are no rich people in existence today that are that rich. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:42:12
It won't be around for 30 years. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:45:48
You'd have to be a fucking idiot to spend bitcoins at a pizza shop.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:52:30
Idiots, why not just sell it all... 
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:07:20
What basic shit? That bitcoin isn't any different from the other coins out there? That in fact it's actually technologically inferior to many. That it's current value is simply due to early adoption and irrational exuberance. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:38:41
Hahaha good deflection 
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:04:40
Because that much money is more than you could spend in 5 lifetimes, and it's an insanely risky gamble to hold it. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:48:51
You too man! It's only bitcoin after all.  I'm more than happy for you if you are making out like a bandit :)
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:28:13
They aren't that rich, I don't even think they're billionaires...well not until they sell anyway. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:15:21
That's about the dumbest analogy ever. If my pilot stood to become a billionaire and was guaranteed to survive said crash, you better fucking believe I wouldn't be setting foot on that plane. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:27:23
You're basically saying 2 people can crash the entire bitcoin market... Another reason to add to the list of reasons to not invest in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:49:51
When clones can be created out of thin air for basically nothing, how can you expect BTC to stay relevant?  What does it offer that clones do not?  Seems like the only thing that BTC has going for it is name recognition because it was early to the market.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:14:09
Yeah oil in a world where anyone can build a drilling rig for next to nothing and start producing oil.
I still haven't heard from a single source what makes bitcoin any better than all the other coins out there? From what I've seen and read it's actually technologically inferior to many other coins. The only thing it has going for it is early adoption from what I can tell.
What makes you think that bitcoin will stand the test of time versus the other better coins coming out?
Seems to me they are more betting on the model T being the only car ever invented. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:57:05
Hahaha if you believe that, I got some beachfront in Kansas to sell you. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:43:48
Yeah that's called fraud. I can also buy a Porsche and say I use it for my plumbing business...
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:13:49
1.4 billion buys a lot of influence... As far as I can tell bitcoins don't give you any influence over anything other than the bitcoin market. 
@_date: 2015-12-13 14:16:32
There's a sucker born every minute. 
@_date: 2015-12-13 14:15:21
When will it become impractical for 100%?
@_date: 2015-12-13 14:19:52
Yeah man it sucks that they are now worth 25...
@_date: 2015-12-14 00:48:29
What if the price doesn't outpace the cost to produce them?  Doesn't it some point become not worth mining anymore coins?
@_date: 2014-04-15 01:31:16
What does "shrugs" mean?  You're not filing taxes? Not reporting income? Not in the US?  I don't get what you mean?  Are you getting a 1099 or are you just completely full of shit and lying so you can't really explain your situation?
@_date: 2014-04-14 23:28:27
You can't really compare amazon and overstock. Amazons selection dwarfs overstocks by many times. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 01:26:43
Why?  Also how does that work on your taxes if you are in the US?
@_date: 2014-04-15 03:37:24
I can't tell if this is a serious questions or not, is it idiot night on reddit or is it just this sub reddit?
"I believe we need to recognize that failing to pay taxes constitutes disobedience in a sense that merely failing to comply with other laws does not. Taxes are the fuel that runs the engine of liberal democracy.
Paying taxes may or may not be a patriotic act – that depends on how one defines patriotism. But it is certainly a duty of citizenship, one with arguably more significance than complying with many regulatory laws. As Stephen Holmes and Cass Sunstein have argued, if legal rights are to be considered meaningful, the existence of a government is required first to establish and then to enforce those rights.
Running a government is costly; paying taxes is necessary in order to support the communal infrastructure by which individual rights are upheld."
Or as Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., famously put it: "I like paying taxes. With them I buy civilization."
@_date: 2014-04-15 01:57:04
What the fuck are you talking about? Are you in the US? Are you filing income taxes?  Why are you being so cryptic?  If you're working in the US and getting paid and not paying income taxes you're definitely not honoring all the agreements you've made.  I can't tell if you're an idiot, asshole or just a troll.
@_date: 2014-04-15 00:07:10
You have no idea what you are talking about. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 01:43:07
Are you reporting your income and paying what you owe?  Otherwise, you and your employer are breaking the law?  Awesome job dick-hole.
@_date: 2014-04-15 02:07:23
*Again I can't tell if you're an idiot or a troll.*
 
The truth is that the Secretary of State proclaimed the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment on February 25, 1913, 26 U.S.C. § 1 imposes tax on taxable income, 26 U.S.C. § 63 defines taxable income as gross income minus allowed deductions, 26 U.S.C. § 61 defines gross income as all income from whatever source derived, and 26 U.S.C. § 6012 requires the filing of returns by every individual with gross income for the year (with some exceptions). Dozens of cases have upheld the federal government's power to collect income taxes against just about every argument.
Judges have little tolerance for tax protesters, particularly ones who convince other people not to pay taxes while being deceptive about the enormous legal consequences. Adherents who practiced what they preached are in jail for tax evasion, many for dramatically hefty sentences. 
If you are a citizen of the US you are bound by these laws and thus whether you "agree" with it or not you are legally obligated to pay taxes.

hahahahah if you think Gmail vanishing overnight wouldn't have a MASSIVE impact on the online world you're kidding yourself.
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:14:11
You do know gmail isn't just used by kids and grandmas right?
@_date: 2014-04-15 01:23:44
So do you have a salary set in bitcoins or just a dollar amount that gets converted to bitcoins?  
@_date: 2014-04-15 02:20:45
Yeah definitely idiot.  Conversation over.
@_date: 2014-04-15 01:26:14
Yeah cause that's totally what I meant...
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:12:20
Easy solution stop telling people where you invest your money. There's no reason for it to be public.
