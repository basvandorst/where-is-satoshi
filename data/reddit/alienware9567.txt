Thank you :)
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:49:19
Thank you :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:42:14
Very cool. You should create an email subscription list to notify interested people for when the Android version is out. And send me the link to it when you would have done so :D otherwise I might forget it :)
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:13:00
Ok, thank you very much. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:32:17
My transaction is still pending since 1 hour, though I have the highet fee.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:54:03
No sadly not. I contacted my credit card provider and had to fill out a form for a pull back or something. I hope they will handle it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:51:47
Ok, so nodes can not prevent double spending. Can the miners do more harm than double spending? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:34:13
Oh ok. So the miners do have the power over the nodes and they can not see a betrayal?
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:00:25
Do you have an example?
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:49:04
Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:24:36
That's interesting. Thank you. Which wallet etc. do you recommend to access the chain via private key from your paper?
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:19:34
Thank you. I´ve read, that the nodes would not realise, if 51% of the miners would double spend a transaction. If they do that, wouldnt that be like printing coins? 
And will such an attack be recognized without specifically looking for it?
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:31:05
Fun fact. I will buy all the pineapples in a German store and bath in it's flesh eating juice to test if it will eat me. Since I am a German student writing his bachelor thesis about crypto-assets this would count as a scientific experiment. If you donate to this address I will finance a little portion of my student loan with this and will provide a picture of proof :D  Furthermore I will eat pineapple every day for 1 year straight with a picture of proof every day. For charity reasons of course.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:12:31
Was also surprised :) thanks
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:59:44
Why do you think so?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:48:30
So Doublespending would result in a fork?
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:13:23
That is true. But what I can't seem to find any information on is whether that attack would be detected or not. Do you know about That?
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:07:31
Well, I do have some conclusions, but I wanted to ask for other opinions, not initially throwing in what I know, so that I can get unbiased answers. Before I raised this questions I could not find 100% matching answers to my question. But thank you for being polite. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:52:20
Yes I know. But that was not the case. One amount would be no problem but since I got the error message I tried again 2 more times. 3 times the sum I planned is too much :(
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:43:02
Does that mean that sending from a nano s with the same address over and over is not posing any risk?
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:51:26
That is true but what about the nodes? They are the ones who confirm and add the blocks to chain as far as I know. Even if 51% of the miners go bad, the nodes would still have a word. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:23:32
I am not so into the topic of proof-of-burn. What does that mean for this counterparty?
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:59:02
Oh, that is interesting. The game looks pretty good as well. How does that work. Is it like ethereum, that you run the game on the blockchain of bitcoin? Or do you use the counterparty tokens?
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:08:09
Ok thank you :) read about it and thought I'd rather ask before I make mistakes.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:13:50
Thanks for that answer. Very interesting. Helps a lot :)
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:59:13
Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:58:25
Thank you very much for that detailed answer. As far as I know the nodes would just add illegitimate blocks, if 51% of the miners would broadcast them, as long as they are "valid", which would be the case if they would only use double spending. 
Would it be possible to detect that?
And wouldnt it be economically worth it, if they send a sum large enough?
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:00:27
Another question that came just into my head: If you are double spending, aren´t you automatically "creating" new coins?
@_date: 2017-11-06 11:49:02
I am not so deep into this topic. What exactly does the lightning network do?
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:31:36
So you believe that b2x will win?
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:57:13
I only use the app. I did not get any announcements there. Neither a mail btw.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:21:05
But before the forks alts tend to lose in btc tends to gain. Then after the fork btc gets it's all time high and the coins are the lowest.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:29:57
That is true but the volatility is way lower than for example the euros. A merchant can be more sure that the euro is still worth 5€ in 10 days than he is able to predict Bitcoin value in 10 days.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:52:05
Thank you for your detailed answer. That is indeed true. Do you believe that Bitcoin should be used a currency now or in a few years, or do you see it more as a store of value?
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:57:38
Oh Ok, thanks for the explanation. How can they draw the gaahrate away if the miners of the Btc chain split into the btc and the b2x chain? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:37:28
Why 7pm? :D
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:39:20
Yeah that could work as well. I think I'll buy some now but not too many.
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:55:18
So the snapshot will happen with the fork right? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:31:21
Thanks :)
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:37:54
Oh ok. Is there an estimated timeframe where it can be expected to be finished?
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:17:14
Thats also a good plan. But I'm not sure. I think about waiting a little longer until Bitcoin is high enough to go into alts again. I think they might start to go off around the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:12:05
Yes, I just received the Mail on 9:49pm.
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:12:22
Thank you very much for the detailed answer. The link goes to a Twitter post. Was that intended?
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:45:56
Which alts do you go for? I think I will go with Vertcoin, Groestlcoin, OMG and maybe XMR. Got any other tips?
@_date: 2017-11-02 02:33:40
Ok thanks :)
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:26:37
I just read that even many miners start to put their money into BitcoinCash. Do you know why? 
Also yes, I think that it is very sad. But they try to benefit from it :(
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:55:00
Thanks. That sounds interesting. But it needs more users so that it works?
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:57:55
Ardor seems interesting. Will look into that. Yeah I really hope OMG will take off. Hopefully soon
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:49:38
Yeah that could work as well. I think I'll buy some now but not too many.
@_date: 2017-11-01 22:21:45
I am not sure about that. Why would it drop so low?
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:51:50
That is true. But as far as I know there is no other currency out there as volatile as cryptocurrencies. You could store your value in them but you can not predict their value in the future (sure fiat money can crash as well but it is mostly stable until the point of the crash). Wouldn´t that exclude btc from beeing a currency?
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:23:53
I wouldn't say so. There are many factors to consider. Political factors, media coverage etc. So if you look at those and ask others for their opinion I would not call it annoying.
@_date: 2017-11-06 11:55:02
Running a node is so important. It's very sad that so few people who hold Bitcoin know about that.
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:15:41
When do you believe the fork will happen?
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:25:25
Veri I got as well. But I want to look deeper into it before I buy more. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:49:22
Good idea!
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:03:02
Never used that. Is there credit card an option as well?
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:15:06
Where do you sell yours? I have my btc on my exodus wallet which gives me access to my private keys. Do you know if I have to do something manually to get the split?
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:17:24
Might be a too obvious question but what does NYA stand for?
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:22:00
How do I read these? Are the fees the first amount? 11$ would be a lot right? [](
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:43:51
Can you explain that further? I am not that deep into the topic. Why would lowering the hashtag help? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:54:26
Oh so there are nodes and miners? They are seperate things? 
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:00:47
Ok, thank you very much. From where did you gain your knowledge. Do work with blockchain technology? I am going to write my bachelor thesis in Germany about this topic and I´m still in the research phase. If some further questions come up, may I contact you again over reddit? 
Would really appreciate good help :)
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:20:50
Oh no, please don't get me wrong. I am not so informed in this topic yet so that's why I ask so many questions. What was wrong about the nonce?
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:06:04
Ah ok. That's a good example. Thank you very much :)
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:48:46
I meant 10.000€. For me it's pretty much :) especially after having only invested a few hundred yet. But yeah, probably will go for kraken.
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:22:59
Ok, thank you. But afterwards that chain is broadcasted to the entire network, so that everybody has the same chain. In this sub I read that there is a difference between nodes and miners and that only nodes add block to the chain. 
Where is the difference?
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:37:09
I believed miners integrate the blocks. If they from the blocks and find the right nonce don't they do it?
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:55:43
Thank you for your explanation. What diffenciates a soft from a hard fork? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:58:39
Ok. From my point of view they should communicate that in order to keep your keys and the system you invest in safe,you should run a node. In fact I never found it anywhere until in this subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:40:00
Ok, so thats all a miner does? What happens after he found the right nonce. From what I knew until know is that the miners seeking for the right one is random,so that it gets unpredictable who will be allowed to add the block into the chain. If the nodes actually do it it confused me a little bit. 
So if the miner broadcasts to have found the right nonce the nodes will check that block and every node will integrate the block into their chain? But miners also check everything right? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:28:27
Does running a full node mean to mine as well?
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:56:20
If I run a node as a user would I have to run it 24/7, or just when I need it to act as my wallet? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:22:36
So without People Volunteering to set up Full nodes the system wouldnt work? Are there any incentives besides believing in the system to keep running the node the whole time? And do miners act as nodes as well? Or do they only block the transactions and try to find the right nonce?
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:47:51
Yes, I understand that. But I still do not understand the technical process. What exactly happens after the miner confirmed a block. I believed he integrates it into his chain and broadcasts it. But if only nodes add blocks to the chain I´d like to understand what happens there.
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:31:44
I wrote Satoshi Nakamotos identity. It needs an S to refer to the word identity :D
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:57:59
But one transaction can only be in one block and not in two or more as far as I know. 
I meant the reward the miners gain for guessing the right answer. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:21:47
Oh nice. Tried to get the book in my library and as a pdf online but didn't manage to find it yet. 
Thanks, will definitely do that :)
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:20:10
So when a block is confirmed by the nodes they broadcast this into the network and all the other miners who tried to solve a block with some of the same transactions stop immediately and start over?
And what happens in case two miners find the right answer to a block with some identical transactions? I now understand that the timestamp is the rule but if every miner who finds the right answer gains 4 btc, but his block was older, are these 4 btc given after he solved the puzzle or only after the block has been accepted by all of the nodes? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:39:46
Oh Ok, thank you. In what way does this contribute to the System? Or is it just acting as a Medium to define your own rules as a wallet?
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:50:49
Oh ok, that helps a lot. So the technical process would be that the miner who found the right hash to his block gains the reward and then broadcasts this block into the network. The nodes then check and confirm it and add it to the chain. 
So miners are also nodes as well. Is that all correct?
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:37:13
But I believe that only very few of the Bitcoin owners do know that. 


How does it do that?
@_date: 2017-10-28 00:41:03
Did he already prove completely that he is satoshi?
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:49:49
Oh ok. Thank you. From where do you have your knowledge? I am writing my bachelor thesis about thia topic in Germany and I am currently in the research phase. 
Would it be ok if I might ask you some upcoming questions over reddit.
They will surely occur during my thesis :)
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:27:36
And what is the miners task. Do they only collect the transactions and create blocks? And when one miner found the valid nonce and gets the reward. What happens then? Until now I believed they add it to the chain they are working on and broadcast it to everyone else 
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:49:17
How many nodes there are on the side of the miners, and how many nodes are run by individuals who do not mine.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:03:22
Ok that completely explains my question. Thank you very much. 
So a block reward is granted after guessing the right answer but will be denied later if this chain is being orphaned?
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:05:38
That is interesting. Thank you. Do exchanges have an interest in only miners running full nodes? They are one of the places people get in contact first with the coins after maybe reading about Bitcoin in the news. Shouldn't they educate them a little bit? Or do they want the users to store their coins for them?
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:39:12
Thanks for your answer :) Did not know the wiki yet, but it looks very much like what I could use. I am already getting deeper into this topic but the more answers I look up, the more comes around that I need to research more. 
But yeah, it's definitely the right topic. Nothing interests me more than this since weeks :)
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:32:59
Thanks. From where do you have the part of the government funding?
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:45:33
Oh Ok. Thank you. I'm just confused because everybody explains that the miners collect transaction, group them I right a block and then try to find the right nonce to get the right hash. If they find it they are allowed to add it to the chain. So what happens if they find the right hash. Do they send it to the nodes and they add it?
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:06:49
Thanks. What would be a simple example?
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:55:22
Oh that's interesting. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:31:26
As far as my knowledge goes the mathematical process of confirming a block as a miner goes like this: a miner collects transactions from the network and puts them into a block. Once he has done that he begins to try to find the right answer for the hash function. This works by putting the values of the transaction data and a random value, a "nonce" into the function and hoping to get a right amount of zeros at the beginning. Predicting the outcome of the function is pretty much impossible so the miners have to try over and over again and hope to be the ones to find the "nonce" that archives the right output. 
From here is where I am now confused. Until now I believed that the miner, who solved the puzzle was allowed to add the block to the chain. But as I read here only nodes add the blocks. So I don't get what exactly happens after the miner solved the puzzle.
I would really appreciate to understand it :)
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:15:18
Oh ok, thank you. So the miners broadcast the confirmed block and the nodes check it's validity. That explains my question 
@_date: 2017-10-23 12:27:25
Ok, thank you very much. What is the difference between a conceptual and a physical node? 
Do you know the balance of nodes run by miners and nodes run by individuals?
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:48:37
Oh ok. Many people get that wrong then. What do miners do then, if they created a block and found the right nonce?
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:24:33
If every user can run a node he also gets to decide which version of the blockchain he wants to support right? So in case of a hard fork the development team has to convince the nodes to run their software right? 
Isn't that also dangerous as a casual user might not be informed well enough?
