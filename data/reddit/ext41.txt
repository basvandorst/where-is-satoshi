Too long and detailed to read after few or more beers, but i'll look into it later. Sounds interesting.

Get the taxi drivers involved, they are like the analog facebook.

Why not change it after certain amount of time, by popular vote or something.

I don't know enough about the site, but if it's new it's bound to have some sellers who wish to make good profits with arbitrage trading and there might be those who end up buying some because they don't know any better. In bitcoin you are the bank and the broker so knowing what you do is essential. At least before they come up with all inclusive services for bitcoin with wallets and in house traders to manage your funds.
I just got into Bitcoin in this October and with my limited knowledge so far, this is my view on digital currencies. Just to give you more views on the matter.
I see digital currencies having a great future since governments want to downgrade on the use of real cash, some examples already are in sight at least here in Finland. I see bitcoin as the pioneer of the business, but will it be the one we will use in the end? Probably not, as governments want a way to control everything somehow, so they are not shooting down the idea of digital currencies as it encourages us to get more involved. But who knows what will happen next. My advice, get acquainted of digital currencies, buy some and see where it goes.

Here's mine, steady rise until the hearing, crazy fluctuation during the hearing and quick correction at the end.

Time to buy

Maybe an excel sheet comparing all the exchanges would clarify peoples minds about where to go with their money. Now it's just random advertising, would be good for the wiki too.

Sellers market and with a volume so low, you can practically ask for anything in there now.
