Technically it is still only half there and half not working. Everybody who has tried to use it knows that. But I hope it will make good progress.

It's wrong, the website linked is garbage. If you take a look at the original post on the [MtGox Creditors website]( you can see that it says


In general, we consider it appropriate to make payments to creditors who had been depositing BTC (BTC creditors) with Mt. Gox, in BTC and BCH instead of cash.
This is because making payments to BTC creditors in BTC and BCH is the most simple and efficient way, minimizing transaction costs such as bank fees (this is the very advantage of BTC).  Also, if payment is to be made in cash, it will be necessary to exchange a large amount of BTC and BCH for fiat currency, which may result in the decline of the price of BTC, etc.  Further, as the price of BTC and BCH fluctuates rapidly, it is difficult to determine when to sell BTC and BCH.
We think it esirable that the BTC and BCH be sent to exchanges in which many creditors have accounts or can open accounts easily.
This is the right way to do it since everyone who had BTC on MtGox now also has the same amount of BCH and needs to get that. Still no good news for BCH of course, as soon as I get mine, I will sell them.

This could not be further from the truth, the path to SegWit was very messy and took literally YEARS of negotiations between users, miners and different parts of the community who wanted block size increases and parts that did not want block size increases. It went on for a very long time.
@_date: 2018-05-25 09:50:44
If you put it this way I kind of agree. But only "kind of" because most groups really *tried* to force it (in contrast to the opening statement here) - but since Bitcoin is designed in a smart way, no single party could push their agenda without the others. In the end I think the miners got fucked over by the 2x part not being followed through but that was also a big part to blame on Garzik who is a spineless ass. Social media was a total shit show during the time and the censorship in this sub prevented every form of discussion about block size increases. It basically split the community in two, at least on reddit. I hope the next "big thing", whatever that might be, will not be as messy and lenghty as the road to where we are now.
@_date: 2018-05-25 09:54:13
In the end it *was* miners who activated it with their consensus, there is no dusputing that. Why they did it and what forces may have pushed them down that path over the years is debatable - but miners activated segwit, that is a fact. As soon as they signaled it with their high majority it went through. The thing is that they wanted a blocksize increase in return that they never got... which was pretty shitty in my eyes.
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:40:49
Not really. Stock markets may be manipulated a little, but they are still regulated closely looked at. In Bitcoin, manupulation is legal and easy and nobody bats an eye. To assume that these two markets are alike is crazy.

I'm pretty happy to see that although user growth has slowed down a bit since 2017, it is still growing very fast. Are these people all new to crypto and therefore new buyers? We don't know. Maybe some BTC veterans get a wallet for whatever use there too. But nonetheless, even if only half of the new accounts are new BTC users, these are very good numbers.
@_date: 2018-10-17 09:22:03
Unless you just bought BTC or wanted to sell some and now you can't touch them anymore.
@_date: 2018-06-05 11:24:50
Thanks, that is good to know... but a little unintuitive I guess.
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:49:49
If you can't pay anything with it, it is much less useful than you think and value will stay low or even drop. If you can do anything with it, the value will explode. Choose one.

It was absolutely instant. Fees were 0 on my end, except of course for opening the channel with ACINQ, but that was only 2 sat/b I think, right now even onchain is cheap :)
@_date: 2018-06-04 11:12:29
It is still trustless and peer to peer. But defintely censorable, but so is BTC. If tomorrow the government tells exchanges to shut down, BTC is dead for the mainstream in this country. Sure, you can send BTC to your buddy and back and noone can stop you, but at this point in time BTC would probably die in this country because nobody would adopt it if it was outlawed.
@_date: 2018-06-04 10:19:57
Absolutely. But I personally don't see anything wrong with that, I as a normal person don't want to connect to 20 hubs, I want one or two big ones and that should be it.

I never knew that payment processors would be needed on the LN network... I mean it can work if they collect their 1% in fees for smaller payments and such, but that would still require a lot of capital to begin with. Well... let's see, thanks for the input.
@_date: 2018-06-05 06:09:38
Thanks, that explanation helps a lot.
@_date: 2018-06-04 10:20:34
I will try to connect to ACINQ and see what happens, thanks.
@_date: 2018-06-04 14:11:47
Thanks, I need to look into that. Where can I see the direction of funding?
@_date: 2018-06-04 17:11:23
Thanks for your very informative reply! Keep up the good work, I am loving your shop and I will try to buy all keys in the future with LN - doing my part so to say ;)
@_date: 2018-06-04 08:26:47
I was wondering about the "too popular" part - how can a channel be too popular? Let's say it has 0.01 BTC funding (it really has), how many payments of 0.001 BTC can it sustain? Does it get drained every time it is used? I was thinking that it must be replenished by the payee every time it is used - so in theory it should be good to transact up to 0.01 BTC for each payment, indefinitely. At least that is what I would expect.
Also: What node did you connect to to pay joltfun?
@_date: 2018-06-04 11:16:30
I opened a channel to ACINQ and that worked - I just bought a game with lightning for 0.001 BTC, wohoo :)
@_date: 2018-06-04 14:07:48
Good point. 
I am still confused what the open channel from the hub to the merchant would look like. If they fund it with 1 BTC, would it lose funding over time? In the end, if the hub does not buy anything from the merchant, it should retain the 1 BTC indefinitely - because once the hub closes the channel, it needs to get the 1 BTC back. So while I agree that there is cashflow from the users to the hub and from the hub to the merchant, I was under the impression that the channel from the users to the hub would reduce in value (because they buy stuff and if they close the channel they only get what is left in the channel). I don't really understand what happens to the funding of the channel between the hub and the merchant.

@_date: 2018-06-04 13:37:47
Thank you for the info. That sounds like pretty shitty design because the usual use case will be one merchant who is connected to a hub - and he will want to be paid by lots of users who have an open channel to the hub. The merchant himself will not send payments to the hub because he does not buy his stuff with LN, so his channel to the hub will be depleted pretty quickly. Now the merchant has to continuously put the money he is expecting to receive into his channel from the hub(or open multiple/new channels). That sounds very annoying and I would have thought the LN system is smarter. 
What is the proposed solution? Is there one?
@_date: 2018-06-04 12:36:12
Thank you, good read. Looks like we still have some ways to go before LN can go mainstream.
@_date: 2018-07-20 06:02:45

Connect to the Acinq node if you want your payment to go through, that one worked well for me while others didn't.

I agree, as long as shop adoption is as low as it is right now, norhing happening in LN really matters. Lets hope more shops will accept LN soon.

How so? If only a few big wallets own a big fraction of all BTC today the inequality will not get lower with rising price. It will just stay the same. Imagine:
Big wallet then: 100,000 BTC = $100,000
Your Wallet then: 1 BTC = $1
Big Wallet today: 100,000 BTC = 600 Million $
Your Wallet today: 1 BTC = $6000
How did the inequality even out?
