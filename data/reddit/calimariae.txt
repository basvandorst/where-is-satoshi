I don't think you're using that word correctly
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:17:10
Some of them are just altcoins
@_date: 2018-01-09 10:30:28
How did you come to that conclusion?
As long as there are people who want to buy bitcoin, there will be ways to convert. It's as simple as that.
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:03:03
The NASA one is very nice.
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:45:59
A lot of them are, but there are also some genuinly interesting alts right now.
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:44:55
Why? Just sell it back to BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:00:01
You could pay me 10 BTC and I still wouldn’t wear that.
Who would want to be seen wearing something that says «Bitches. Thugs. Cocaine»?

It's unclear to any of us what their goal is judging by recent events like their role in American election.

You generally do trigger people by going around calling them scum of the earth for sharing their opinions. You'll live to learn that as you mature.

Exactly. The pressure isn't there yet, but once it is Ali will adapt.

Haven't mentioned myself in any of these comments.


We're on a discussion board. We're discussing. Nowhere does it say "List a charity and shut up".


None of us are having it you absolute retarded discharge. We're discussing charities, not ourselves.

The coin isn’t the problem. The way he’s misleading newcomers into thinking they’re buying BTC is.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:44:17
Don't do this. Just use Bitstamp.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:42:13
I sent money from my Norwegian bank yesterday. It arrived at Coinbase a few hours ago.
Smooth as butter for me.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:15:39
They're politically influenced and their agenda isn't clear.
They've also had very large amounts of BTC donated to them throughout the years, and are definitely not strapped for cash.
If anyone's handing out Bitcoins to charity, Wikileaks shouldn't be one of the recipients.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:40:04
Yeah, but who wants to move to Romania?

Nothing about beliefs here. Fact stating.


Not telling. Asking, and even using please.


That's generally what you do on a forum; share opinions.


Wrong. Nowhere does it state that. That's just your personal assumption.


Wrong. It's unclear whether this person are informed about all the facets of Wikileaks. I'm highlighting them.


I'm not.

Please don’t donate to Wikileaks.
They have an agenda and they are not neutral.

1.	Claim when possible. 
2.	Sell for more BTC.
Now if I could only find a way to sell my BTG...

But there are always obvious bugs and security holes (features) that would probably get picked up with more eyes on the code.

There’s a fine middle between all that though.
Not everyone wants to waste their every waking hour working, be without broadband and driving a piece of shit car.
That doesn’t make them a lazy slob.

It is, but it's also an ad that creates awareness and thus benefits all of us.

It often indicates a lack of faith in the asset from the seller.
@_date: 2018-11-02 11:41:03
I hope you get your coins back.
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:19:12
It is a store of value specifically because it isn't tailored for micro or nano transactions.
Lightning solves that.
@_date: 2017-09-05 11:06:08
No. The market won't care if you dump &lt;10 BTC on something.
The market cares if a thousands of BTC are being dumped within a short time frame.
It's the whole notion of of "Oh shit, a lot of people are selling - I better sell too". It's the domino effect where each seller lowers the asking price in order to dump.
It's the same in the stock market. The price usually drops whenever a large holder starts selling off.
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:06:46
Don't underestimate the psychological effect. In the scenario where there are more sellers than buyers the sellers are forced to continually lower their asking price - thus the price is lowered. It's a constant loop of sellers undercutting each other.
It's fairly simple really.
If there are more buyers than sellers - the price goes up.
If there are more sellers than buyers - the price goes down.

* Delete your reddit account.
* Write down what's in that Excel sheet.
* Do the recover on a clean machine.
* Sell off whatever you need to be comfortable for the rest of your life.
* Pay taxes.
* Have a drink.
Good luck bro. Enjoy your new life.

As a ledger owner I find myself massively annoyed that I can only have about 3 different wallets installed at one time.
Not sure if Trezor has the same restriction.
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:10:25
So their whole excuse that it was "limited by design for security" was a load of horse shit then?

I added a page with some current statistics and one that explained how much BTC had risen in the last decade.
I figured those numbers are impressive enough that the parents will guard those paper wallets with their lives.
As for explanations - there's really no good way for you to explain it to them now and them having to remember those instructions for the next 16-18 years.
I figure either there's an easy way to withdraw by then, or they'll have to ask me for help.
