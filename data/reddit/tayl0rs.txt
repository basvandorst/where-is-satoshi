   * Your app server should only be able to call stored procedures.
   * Use bind variables for everything when making database calls.
Those 2 things kind of contradict each other...
Using stored procedures instead of raw SQL + bind variables is not going to buy you any additional security except maybe obscure the database architecture from the application code.
Everything else is great.

I guess you're right, you could pass arguments into the stored procedure and then execute dynamic sql. /facepalm

Dude, rtfm.
You have to install the DiabloMiner package first, from inside the DiabloMiner folder. It's in the instructions thread on how to setup DiabloMiner, but it's easy to miss (I had to re-read it after getting the error.)
    mvn package
If you're on OSX you will need to also make sure you have the Rosetta utility installed, which auto installs the first time you try to run a PPC program (like VLC ppc version). If you dont have it, you will get an error during the package install.

How many coins were you able to mine? What was your mining rig back then? I'm just curious.
@_date: 2011-06-10 19:18:48
1:1 parity with the dollar is my guess.
@_date: 2011-06-22 01:49:15
Nah, if you want to run it on a Mac you have to stick with version 1. It's fine though.
@_date: 2011-06-09 04:30:42
Ok my only guess is you have multiple java versions on your computer and `mvn package` is installing the DiabloMiner package to a different java version than what the diablo miner startup script is using.

Yes, and the default functionality of OSX is to give the mounted drive the same path every time, so it *should* work.

hey. i stopped by your restaurant last sunday. great food and i love paying with bitcoin!
i saw this a little late but i figured as a non-german speaker it would probably be boring for me since i'm assuming most of the conversations there were in german, ya?
@_date: 2013-02-28 05:57:03
coins can never run out because you can own a fractional coin
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:03:49
Fuck. The Mt Gox UI makes it seem like you only have to check the "pay fee" box if you're transferring tiny amounts of bitcoin.
So will 0 fee transactions eventually get confirmed?
It's been 6 hours so far, still 0 confirmations.

damn, it must be pretty profitable to run a pool.

What app should I get on my iPhone that lets me pay with stuff like that? I live in Berlin and would really love to go down there and buy some burgers with my bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:31:34
what is a reasonable period to wait?
@_date: 2013-05-02 21:05:28
yeah, but what usually happens is even though everyone *can* speak english, the conversations are just always in german unless talking specifically to me.
but yeah, i'll stop by next time and check it out.

no refunds son. afaik no one has gotten a refund after requesting one. i have a preorder too (just 1 jalepeno) but i'm starting to think it was a huge scam =(
@_date: 2013-09-16 09:09:20
I paid via bitcoin anyways so I'm assuming getting a refund will be next to impossible. No?
@_date: 2013-09-16 09:00:06
URL to refund thread?
@_date: 2013-05-02 23:56:41
i've gone to tons of parties with my german wife and believe me, its usually just everyone speaking german unless they specifically want to talk to me. it gets old after a while. i shoudlnt complain though, i need to start learning better german so i can conversate in the local tongue. but i'm an introvert and would usually rather just stay home and talk on the internet anyways =)
anyways, i'll definitely try and come to the next bitcoin meetup
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:12:33
Oh I didnt even see it has an estimated confirm time. Thanks =)
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:14:32
you really have no good way of transferring the money out unless you verify your account. they are cocks about it.
@_date: 2013-05-03 12:19:37
awesome. glad to hear it =)
