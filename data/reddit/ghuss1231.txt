I’ve heard about this before but exactly what would be the negative side to altcoins being mined in the background of your PC? Aside from the whole invasion of privacy aspect.

Seems like this is probably what’s been using all nearly of my CPU recently. I browse crypto related sites quite often. Would Miner Blocker remove these programs or does it just block it from happening any further?

Completely agree with you. If enough people silently fall for it then there will subsequently be an effect. A small one for us hodlers

Yea Canada is big into BTC, I remember noticing a few while wandering around Montreal. Should be no problem for you.

Exactly. What does a guy like that have to lose? He could buy in w over $1M and not even be affected if it hypothetically dropped to 0 the next day. Why discredit the entire thing, except to drive the price down?

I assume he knows almost nothing about how bitcoins are mined and the algorithms that give it value. Which makes him angry. Very angry. Very angry that millennials may have found a way to over throw businesses like his for the greater good. 
It's like a 70 year old trying to figure out how to use an iPhone 7. Useless.

One of the best words of advice I've ever read on here is "don't believe anybody." Don't believe hype and don't believe things you read some CEO said. Just don't invest more than you can bare to lose and HODL.
Also bitcoin is working to become deflationary when its maximum 21M coins are mined. This is predictable and will happen around 2040. Read the sticky post on this sub. I found it very helpful.

If you hold until you die you never take a loss
