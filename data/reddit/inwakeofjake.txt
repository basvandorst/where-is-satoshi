That is what I was thinking.  Everything about the cryptocurrency is beautiful so now we just have to make the infrastructure equally stable.

I think you are right about this one.  I have provided help so far just for family and friends whom I don't charge but looks like strangers are a bit timid.  Why trust some random kid with a thing that will store possibly millions of dollars...  I get it.

I never install add-ons.  I just downloaded Honey.  Although it still seems a bit cumbersome right now with all the steps I like the move towards making spending Bitcoins a more common practice.

Storage and security are aspects of Bitcoin I would like to make better. What would be the best track in college to pursue? I'd ultimately like to program an app that provides the location and other information on places that accept bitcoin.

It was more about the price than trying to show the slight decline. Trying to get a laugh whenever i can these days.

I actually never wanted their computer to touch the internet for security and had the libraries OS libraries pre-downloaded on the drive.  I set them up with a secure cold storage wallet and left them with details on using a watching only wallet to talk with the internet.

I wanted to go to school to program iPhone apps for businesses looking to implement Bitcoins.  Looks like Android will be the way to go.
