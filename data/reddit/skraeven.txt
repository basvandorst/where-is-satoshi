Terrible analogy.

Your nonsensical math does not get better by reposting it.

There's ONE merchant in a 50km radius from the 2nd largest city (Aarhus) according to coinmap, and they sell Moroccan carpets...

No, if someone disagrees, they live in a democracy and are free to vote for a party that shares their views, or in this case, start their own, since (in Denmark) even the most right leaning party with only 5% votes ( including me, btw) would touch the subject. 


Yeah because no one ever died from not being able to afford health care? lol. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 14:43:23
Good points, thanks.
@_date: 2014-01-02 19:40:55
That is not what "Hopefully she was a bad apple" means.
@_date: 2014-01-12 16:59:27
Well I think you are hindsighting your explanations a lot. The comment I linked didn't speak of any dead cat bounces or explicitly say "go back up" == "exceed $1242".
Let's leave it though, I'm still interested in knowing what will happen if/when the price reaches $1242, are you going to admit you were wrong? Stop making predictions as if they are fact?

So, because this is business as usual for Apple, we shouldn't inform and discuss when they do shit like this? It's very relevant for people on a bitcoin discussion site, who haven't completely made up their minds about Apple, that they know their device manufacturer will have zero tolerance for bitcoin.

Or because they like living in a country where people take care of each other?.. No that would be crazytalk...

Wouldn't there be some extremely obvious signs if someone with 51% was building a chain in secret? Like, wouldn't all "real" (non-hidden) blocks be mined at half the usual speed? So there would be time to move away from the attacking pool in such an event.
@_date: 2014-01-12 17:56:12
Oh I see, so if I smack some more numbers on from before $1242, it is now an uptrend again? Got it.
@_date: 2014-02-06 14:37:18
I think you're in the wrong thread or something, this isn't about datamining.
@_date: 2014-01-12 18:20:26
I am challenging your opinion that the only valid interval to measure a trend is from $1242 to present.
@_date: 2014-01-23 02:37:34
I was simply commenting on your views on a country you've likely never been to for an extended period of time. What you call 'forced to pay for health care', I would call 'universally *agreeing* to pay for health care'.
Kind of like what you would call 'emphasis on not spending other people's money', I would probably call 'being ok with letting people die in the streets'. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 15:33:32
Yeah, that's not what I said at all... 
@_date: 2014-01-12 16:10:33
You gave an advice to not buy in at $700, even though the price is now +35% of that and even though you, according to yourself, thought it would go to $900? If that's not bad advice/an inaccurate prediction, I don't know what is. 
Also you seem to be very fond of explaining everything with "give it time" etc. but i would like to see your explanation of how "look at charts of other bubbles, and you'll see that the price doesn't go back up immediately after the crash" is a correct prediction. So I guess right now we are 'pre-immediately', or?

He just isn't enlightened by his own intelligence.
@_date: 2014-01-12 15:16:10
Hey man, how about [this one]( as an answer to "Is now a good time to get started with bitcoin?". Let me just quote you:






Do you consider this an 'accurate prediction' seeing as the price at time of your writing (around $700) has risen  ~35% and peaked at 55% increase?
Also, reading this thread, I'm curious if you are going to shut up forever if/when the price reaches $1242?
@_date: 2014-01-23 01:44:34
And you will be very hard pressed to find a swede who disapproves of it. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 17:47:44






How is this a downtrend?
@_date: 2014-02-16 02:29:37
What about bitstamp then? It went to $530 twice this week, yet you claim the volatility is only $800-&gt;$650. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:21:19
Why would I care about other subs? I was replying to your comment about Anyone stating that the sub is "reserved for BTC discussion" is outrageously hypocritical, considering how much shit is posted and upvoted about BCash/VerCoin.
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:35:26


@_date: 2018-03-03 11:32:07
Dude, both subs are complete trash. Which is worse is like arguing if eating shit or puke tastes better.

BRB need to buy a bike with my last bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:18:41
Well that doesn't sound so bad to be honest. When I check your submission history, most posts are [removed] but I guess you did it yourself then?
Regarding your example, if I was a mod, I would count it as 'No blatant bullshit posts'. Since you obviously don't own 3174 bitcoins.
I'm more interested in knowing if you are getting a lot/any *comments* removed. If you don't, I wouldn't say mods are silencing you in any way.
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:36:35
His point still stands. I hate memes as much as the next guy, but this is a bad decision.
@_date: 2013-12-17 13:33:53
How many comments have you had censored though? I would guess mods are removing your submissions, not because of your opinions, but because you are spamming 10-20 submissions every day...
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:33:50
Your bitcoin directed anger might be one of the saddest things I've seen.
It's like if I went to and spending every day, for a year, posting reasons why people should stop watching a childrens show. Even watching the episodes myself so I can be extra angry.
But I don't. Do you know why? Because I don't care what other people spend their time/money on, even if I think it's dumb.
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:23:53
You're trolling about a word that 99.9% of gamers use or at least are familiar with. There's no such thing as "valid points", it's what people use to refer to competitive gaming.
Anyway, want to explain to me why it's called BitCoin when it's not even a real coin? It's just stupid numbers on a computer, nothing physcial about it lolz.
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:16:30
That is hilarious. Trolls are getting desperate.
@_date: 2013-12-19 11:18:10
That ban was only for the negatively-vibed memes/emotional posts, didn't you know..?
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:12:43
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:42:35
Then how come you are running around this subreddit, creaming your pants during "crashes", if you care so much about people losing their money?
@_date: 2013-12-19 11:23:02
Well, that ban sure was temporary  To the moon, right guis?
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:12:12
Common sense dictates that you don't have 3174 bitcoins, it's as simple as that.
