uhh the bitcoin.com app doesn't have 2fa? unless it's hidden somewhere. I have fingerprint lock tho

I know about that. If you look [here]( the tx records are correct and accounted for up till Nov 9.

uhh okay but I've been using that even before Bitcoin Cash came out. How does my issue relate to that in any way? If i get my funds back I'm transferring to another wallet anyways.

[here's my balance](
if passwords can just be guessed, isn't it pretty insecure? also doesn't explain the 2 incoming transactions.

alright, I'll email them tonight, pretty sure I didn't download anything phishing. thanks!

yea. however after that I deposited another 0.009 (Oct 3) and sent out 0.005 (Oct 14) and 0.0025 (Nov 9). Where did the change go then?
@_date: 2017-11-18 10:01:32
the 0.00275 figure is what I remember and what blockfolio shows me too. even if it's not that amount I know that at the very least I have a certain amount of BTC inside, which isn't recorded as being sent out.

each to their own opinions.

RemindMe! 1 year how is the media reacting to bitcoin now

LPT: transfer your coins to GDAX and use GDAX to withdraw to your personal wallet. Fees are much lower that way.

minors. though I can't find a good reason why miners can't be on exchanges either.
@_date: 2017-09-09 07:52:15
same situation in Singapore for minors, since Coinbase doesn't like minors using their service. Anything else is at least USD200 higher than US exchanges.
