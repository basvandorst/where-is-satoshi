that price is pretty standard for mushroom kits, if you know of a shipping solution that can ship a 7lb box for less let us know. we try to keep our shipping prices as low as possible.

Average yield is around 1/4 a flush, if temps are right and you care for them you can get 4 flushes out of each kit.

bithasher, over here at subfarms we grow gourmet blue oyster mushrooms  for our local markets and restaurants. our kits are good for all kinds of mushrooms. if you would like to grow shiitake mushrooms and are serious about purchasing them using bitcoin we could easily put together some shiitake plugs for you to innoculate your own logs with.

we are planning to add dowel spawn to our store ASAP but for now the best way would be to send us an email at Orders add in the email that you spoke with Ryan about blue oyster dowel spawn and ill make sure everything goes smoothly. 
Thank you!

The general rule of thumb is 100 plugs for 3 logs 4-6 inches in diameter and 3-4 feet in length. The main thing with plug spawn is the wait time between inoculation and fruiting, it varies anywhere between 3-12 months before you see any mushrooms, as with bags its a much faster process. winter time is the best time to cut the logs for a spring inoc. as well so its a good time to get started!

rumplefistbump the majority of our plugs can be stored in a refrigerator for up to 6 months. Of course it is best to use them as soon as possible. do you have a reason why you prefer dowels? and how many would you be interested in? feel free to give me your email if you would prefer to communicate there.
