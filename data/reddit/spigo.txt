If you really want in there is nothing holding you back from learning how to buy. But most ppl are lazy.

"Buy 1 bitcoin and forget about it for 5 years" 
Man i check the price 10 000 times a day. Can´t stop!

I belive he said that, on an episode of let's talk bitcoin. Talking about waves of adopters. That in 3 years the price would be sky/moon. Or bitcoin would have failed. Well well, I guess I was a bit caougt  up with the surge at that time. 
Maybe we are ready now for the next craze.

I remember Andreas 3 years ago saying. In 3 years Bitcoin will be worth a lot or nothing. Well we are still looming around 500$. Go figure.
