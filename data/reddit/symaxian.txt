Payment processors such as Coinbase should offer Visa/Mastercard debit cards that instantly transfer BTC in your account to USD in the merchants account. I know debit cards do not work as a push system but I'm sure some smart guys at Coinbase or BitPay could easily abstract away those details.    
I wouldn't be surprised if more than one business is already working on this.

He assumes that the tax code is written into the fabric of reality, people make erroneous assumptions like these all the time. If the conforming to the law to 100% is impossible, guess what changes, not society, the law.
There are NO absolutes, only sides to everything. On a massive scale people and society behave somewhat like a fluid, and the law of least resistance still applies.

I purchased one quite a while ago, if I remember it did take a while to come in, but it eventually did.

Incorrect, 100 Satoshi's makes a micro-bit, whereas a nano is one thousandth of a micro, so a satoshi is 10 nano-bits. Unfortunately we cannot trade nano-bits, the divisibility is currently limited to 10 nano-bits.

OP might have meant that web-wallets should report this activity to its users, in that regard I agree. Every online account provider should report this activity to its users. There is a slight inconvenience involved in that the provider must record all login attempts, but it does result in some useful data.

If only this was truthful. Honestly if I oversaw a small nation-state I would push for the following course of action:
- Buy large amounts of Bitcoin.   
- "Leak" document[s] detailing plan to migrate to using Bitcoin as our national currency.    
- Sell Bitcoin, profit!!!  
- Denounce the leaked document[s] as nothing more than a hypothetical situation.

Keep in mind that due to coin rot there will never be 21 million BTC available. It's possible for example that Satoshi destroyed his private keys, ensuring that there are already at least 900k coins lost forever.
Coin rot - Slow degradation of coin supply over time due to lost private keys or decryption passwords

Depending on the worth of the wallet, some hard drive forensics could very likely be worth using. Just because the hard drive crashes doesn't mean the data is gone, you could swap the platters to a new drive or even pay someone to physically analyze the disk to retrieve the data.

I would store it in the form of a Tesla Model S, but that's just me.  :P

I will try to clear up some confusion.
You still submit your shares to the pool to prove that you are doing work.
However if you find a share that actually creates a new block, you withhold it.
The pool still sees you giving valid shares but not finding any blocks, so you will still get paid for your shares(depending on the payout algorithm the pool uses) but you keep your hash power from helping the pool solve any new blocks.

You're off by a factor of 2, the block reward started at 50 BTC, now it's at 25 BTC, and will drop to 12.5 BTC sometime in late 2016.

I must say that this is pretty brilliant, on the other hand...
Why the did you encode this in JPEG? The compression algorithm does not lend itself well to a large field of static. The grey values for individual pixels are not discernible, especially after being scaled to 1/4 the original size. For actual analysis could you upload/link to the original lossless 4096*4096 image.

The word missing here is "trying", the NSA is TRYING to build a quantum computer to break all forms of encryption. Many people have been trying for a long time but building a quantum computer is INCREDIBLY difficult. It is hard enough to place something like 10 single atoms into a "state", but these atoms then need to be allowed to compute the problem they were given and have the resulting state be read out. In the meantime no other interference can be allowed to disturb the atoms in any way.
I believe some parts of Bitcoin's cryptography can be defeated using Shor's algorithm for factoring large primes. However the largest number that has successfully been factored using this algorithm on a quantum computer is... 15. This was performed on I believe 5 entangled quantum qubits(or atoms). To factor a cryptographically large number you would need to perform this algorithm over hundreds of entangled qubits.
And like many others have said, once quantum computers are available then we have many other problems to worry about besides Bitcoin.

That is a large block, however the AVERAGE block size at the moment is much much lower. Once the maximum block size is reached then only a certain number of transactions will be able to be verified per unit of time(until the maximum block size is increased or removed from the protocol). I believe that number has been approximated to around 7 tx/second. Though that number can vary greatly as the size of each transaction can vary depending on the number of inputs/outputs.
I wish the dev's would hurry and hardfork to remove the 1MB limit, and while they're at it the could also change the protocol to ensure that transaction ID's are signed(so no longer malleable).

You are referring to Bitcoin "miners" the miners help secure the network and in return are rewarded with new Bitcoins. Bitcoins themselves are valuable because they serve a tremendously important purpose in modern life, a secure decentralized digital currency not controlled by a bank/government. Almost anything can be used as currency, as long as society agrees that they will use it. Primitive tribes have used seashells, pebbles, then onto gold, coins, and finally paper. Bitcoin is similar but its benefits transcend all these physical incarnations of currency.

Just a link to the Bitcoin subreddit lol?
