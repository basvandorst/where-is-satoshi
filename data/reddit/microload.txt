The date listed is today, however it's still pending. And I did set up instant purchases, which makes this whole ordeal even more strange.

Ok, still not verified. i got scammed. it's end of day, and nothing in my account.

Yeah.... why the hell are you dating these people? 
@_date: 2017-09-19 03:33:42
huh? i'm specifically talking about a 51% attack. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 19:49:40
very good point

Can't compare ethereum. Bitcoins purpose is a fungible asset. Ethereum is not. If the idea of fungibility is removed from bitcoin due to a fork, then the public perception of it will tank. It won't be seen as a true store of value.

vertcoin? lmao....
@_date: 2017-07-03 22:40:40
what are chances of this fork happening in your opinion? 
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:08:03
And I hope he's successful. Litecoin has a huge opportunity to learn from bitcoins mistakes.

wtf are you talking about? anyone can create a competitor to shapeshift/prism(and they will). it's called entrepreneurship and capitalism. instead of complaining, why not get off your lazy, keyboard jockey ass, and do something?

Also one more question for you Greg! If this happens, do you see bitcoin devs moving over to litecoin? 
@_date: 2017-06-28 22:24:06


Not really. What bitcoin is doing is essentially turning money into a political battlefield. The power will always be centralized amongst a few key players. 
Also, everything you just described can be summed up in "yeah, bitcoin is going against human nature" - so... that means it will fail?
@_date: 2017-06-28 21:48:14
why is that good? even if you don't like bitcoin, it will set cryptocurrency progress back by years, maybe decades.
@_date: 2017-06-28 22:22:13
this is an incredibly stupid comment. alt coins are not forks of bitcoin. totally different idea. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 21:56:14
Do you not understand the mass adoption consequences? The negative PR for the entire crypto movement?
