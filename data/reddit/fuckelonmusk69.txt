Lmfao no one who thinks Japan cares about BTC lives in Japan. It’s popular among a select group of otaku just like it is in the US, and some companies cater for that. The average joe thinks it’s fucking hilarious that people are pouring real money into this.

The hilarious part is where you think this applies to sceptics rather than bitcoin “investors”

I’ve used Bitcoin for about six years to buy drugs. I use it almost every day. It absolutely fucking sucks, has no merits outside of pseudo-anonymity for crime and is about to be replaced by superior options in that sector anyway. That literally only leaves speculative investment.

They use an absurd amount of electricity so I can get weed delivered to my house.

A very nice vendor has already done so, thanks though :) 
Hope no one took my comment too seriously in a negative way, it’s just the role bitcoin plays in my life and therefore the reason I browse this sub to keep up to date with stability/pricing/privacy methods

lol I use DNMs because it’s illegal here, I think buying into WeedCoin would be even more suspicious than other cryptos

Conservatism is literally correlated with low IQ, though. There has never been a study showing the opposite correlation. It’s also correlated with poor academic outcomes, something I see with my own students all the time.
