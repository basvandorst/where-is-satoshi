greater demand means the right side of the green depth chart would have a wave higher/over the orange left side, which is not the case now, if you look near the mid market price more people are trying to sell than people are trying to buy [____|-------] please use this diagram as a visual. left side is buy and right side is sell, the sell wave is higher which means price will go down until the bear market is over

let me know how that works out, the key was designed to reset the phone 2fa if phone is lost or stolen, but since you don't get any messages resetting and adding another auth may fix it.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:14:36
makes sense, what if bitcoin quits us though? 
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:03:33
god damn bears!
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:34:51
Young nigga you can always reset ur phone 2FA, when you first created your Conbase account they gave you a key and with that key you can reset it.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:47:48

The niggas behind him are shaking their heads.. that can't be good! But props to this guy for saying what he said
@_date: 2018-03-26 04:00:10
Well it seems like the sellers stopped dumping hard, and the only time the volume goes up is when people are selling, then it consolidates back down even lower to what it was before. Rinse and repeat. So I'm thinking at this rate the sellers won't have any buyers left to dump on.. then what? We haven't seen a significant volume increase due to buyers in a long time it seems, so yeah people probably losing interest.

How to reieve the private btc if my coin is on coinbase? How will the fork know i have btc? Never got coins from fork before help would be appreciated

@_date: 2018-02-11 18:57:32
You bear supporters are all fools, the correction is def over and now we're back in track to new ath's. If you haven't noticed we've had the MOST stability around 390-400bln market cap for the past week now. Once we have gained a firm 400 we will continue to push further up to 450, that is how it works lads. I don't know where all these people thinking bitcoin is gonna go to 4000-5000 this coming week are thinking.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:36:36
what does this mean? someone educate a nigga here
@_date: 2018-03-16 19:52:23
You fools. The bull market is now. When prices are at the lowest. Not highest. Bull market starts now. Bear markets start when price is going down. We already hit bottom. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:18:20

fuck you stupid bear. keep selling until its at zero, then what profits will you take?
@_date: 2018-03-16 22:36:54
yeah, even the little bitchy bears on tradingview are starting to post bullish outlooks, lmfao!
@_date: 2018-02-04 06:23:12
No one gives a flying fuck about moving the tech forward. We're in crypto to make money just like you are. And OP remember this: In order for you to make money, someone has to lose.....this time it was you losing. 
@_date: 2018-07-14 02:31:41
Not much of a difference, the more patient trader always wins.

Actually now that u mention it, does look like tht. Maybe she wants 1
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:10:38
I'm saying that the market won't be able to sustain these kind of blatant manipulated sell offs out of nowhere. If this goes on for another 4 months we will see people quickly lose interest and take out their money (sell). This will make it very hard for crypto to recover.. like it did in 2014.
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:52:29
Not everyone held through 2014. My point was many sold off thinking the market wouldn't recover for a long time - and they were right. The market took 2 years to recover. So if this constant selling and manipulation continues do you really want another 2 year bear market? Or would you rather just pull your money out now and buy back in later?
@_date: 2018-04-01 05:11:17
Did you just notice you were born too?
@_date: 2018-04-01 18:03:08
Damn bear.
@_date: 2018-04-22 01:09:30
Already beat you to it. Haven't used a bank since 2015. I secure all my cash myself. Anyone who tries to get to it will fall through a trap door into a fiery pit of inferno. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 03:06:46
Hope it's over 9000 by the time you get paid.
@_date: 2018-04-22 19:11:52
jokes on you pal, you'll be waiting another 10,000 years for any of that sh1t to happen.
