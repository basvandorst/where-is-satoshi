You may laugh at me now, but the guy who sold at $102 is not stupid. He knows when the real crash starts ... VERY SOON ... it will only be worth sub $100. 
You can keep being stubborn and acting like nothing is going on, but the amount of confirmed, real negative news is AMAZING. It will not be regulated. Banks will destroy it. They will never be able to control it, but they WILL be able to chase people away by attacking the blockchain and driving the price down, causing huge inflation, and making people lose a lot of money. That will scare people away.
THAT'S THE REALITY MY FLIEND!!

it  is important !!
Major news!!
The $102 bitcoin dump was only 3000 bitcoins sold, probably a hacker who stole from MtGox, if this hacker dumps 88k bitcoins, it will be a disaster! 
@_date: 2014-03-28 13:24:30
In your fucking dreams it is. The Chinese have not dumped yet.
And they WILL HAVE TO DUMP because after April 16th, they can't do shit anymore on those exchanges. No withdrawals, no deposits, no trading. It will be like gox bitcoins. Monopoly money will be worth more. Considering they hold 80% of all bitcoins traded, a MASSIVE DUMP IS INCOMING.

Saving? Saving for what? Until it is worth more, right? And then you will sell it, right? 
If not, then explain to me, why are people 'saving' bitcoins until it is worth a lot of **FIAT MONEY**? Because you all know that it's not really about bitcoins, it is about how much **FIAT MONEY** a Bitcoin is worth.
That's the reality. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 18:04:07
50% of that is worth more than entire Bitcoin market cap, LOL. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:05:45
Fully agree! Tonight will be a major crash. I have set my buy orders at $150. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:24:49
You can't withdraw from Bitstamp either! MtGox is just ahead of everyone!
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:16:02
Major crash is incoming!
This will be like last year's april crash!
Bitcoin will go to 150-200!

Finally someone who cares to respond in a normal, human way. Everyone else is responding like they are hyenas... 
Bitcoin will never be taken seriously if the majority of the bitcoin community is made up of people behaving like 12 year old's who cry &amp; downvote anything that is not to their liking.

''Bitstamp has stated...''
Hahaha. So I guess it must be true, right? Because they stated it, right? I mean, no bitcoin exchange has ever lied, of course. Right? 
LOL. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:27:25
Wow, this shit is getting worse by the hour!
Don't buy now people, it's a tarp... Wait till everything settles a bit &amp; till MtGox is out of the game. It will be safe to buy then. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 10:39:45
You're an idiot if you don't believe your money is safe in the banks. 
No, you're not even qualified as an intelligent 'being' if you believe bitcoins is a better alternative:
- When was the last time a bank got hacked? When was the last time thousands of people were unable to withdraw ANY of their money from a bank?
Bitcoin is only a few years old, and all of the above mentioned already happened. Multiple times. In fact, **IT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW!**
@_date: 2014-02-14 10:42:13
No, nothing is pulled out of the air. Everything I have stated happened.
If you want me to state sources for claims like:
'Overstock made only $1 million in sales, while Bitcoin's total market cap is around $10 billion.'
Then you are exactly what is wrong with the ''bitcoin community''. You downvote posts with REAL information, and claim that it is 'made up'. You obviously don't follow any bitcoin related news, because if you did, you wouldn't ask me to list sources for the information in my post, as everything I have listed is **generally known**.

@_date: 2014-02-11 11:32:23
Wow, thanks for this news!
Just proves how UNRELIABLE and INSECURE Bitcoins are!
@_date: 2014-02-14 04:14:01
Sub $600? Are you kidding!? It was $302 on MtGox!
Stop spreading misleading information, and provide ACCURATE information. It was HALF of what you have posted in your OP!
And we'll go much lower, much!
@_date: 2014-02-11 11:33:53
It was a lie. This fucking Reddit community is only upvoting positive news, anything related to negative bitcoin news gets downvoted massively and/or deleted. It's a shame, only FAKE news is spread.
Positive - negative bitcoin news balance:
1 positive news item for every MAJOR 10 negative newses.
Bitcoin is in a downtrend, it will CRASH, nevitable !
@_date: 2014-02-14 10:47:23
No, everything I have listed are facts... 
It's true, you can sell your bitcoin against goods and services. But the majority will always sell against fiat money. Just look at the exchanges.
The amount of bitcoins sold against fiat in 1 hour, is probably more than the amount of bitcoins used to purchase goods/services in 1 month!
@_date: 2014-02-14 10:54:52
You are an idiot. I bet you didn't even know what bitcoins were until you noticed that you could make good money out of it. 
Go back to school, sheeple. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 18:13:52
Nobody cares about what you say, you will die and nobody will bat an eye. Warren Buffett is someone, he is a genius. Nobody in your family line was, or will ever be, as successful as he is. Not even close. Hell, not even close to not even close. You're a sheep and you will always be a sheep. Don't lose all your money. The $100 that you have ''invested'' in bitcoin, well, you could lose that. And then you're broke.
