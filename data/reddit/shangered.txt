Yup. Thank god they didn't get swayed by the fanbois and the random coked-up CNBC &amp; Business Insider xenomorphs.. Vanguard is a serious place for people seriously thinking about their future, not for speculating wildly with no understanding of finance.
That, plus as a co-operative, they have a real obligation to the people they serve (like a union) and that makes them all the better. Thanks for posting, OP @_date: 2018-01-23 01:51:07

Of course there are. Brazilians love tricksters, hucksters and jesters (see: *jeitinho* as a national pastime). 
They also are currently controlled by one of the dumbest, unpopular and evil coup-leader in history (Michael Temer Abre Cu), so it makes sense they look externally for help.
