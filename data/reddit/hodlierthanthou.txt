I'm giving my 1yr nephew some btc for christmas and I'm wondering how you all think I should do that. My sister and brother in law are technically literate but don't know anything about crypto. I'm nervous about handing them a paper wallet because I'm not confident in my ability to create one securely. I'm thinking the best option is to walk them through creating a coinbase account and using their vault feature. Thoughts?

I've created one in the past but read afterwards about the risk of the data remaining on the printer that can be read after. I can handle offline, livecd booted wallet generation its the actual printing part I don't know how to secure. Is my concern overblown? edit: would the printer even be a concern if I passphrase protected the private key?

For whatever reason it appears that transaction didn't get broadcast to the network or was dropped (0 fee?). Once the samourai wallet detects that the coins haven't moved your balance will update accordingly you haven't lost anything.

Hey stranger, welcome to bitcoin. Some regulars around here don't have patience for newbies. Sorry. Keep reading and asking questions. Not everyone's an asshole.

Do you remember your email address? You may still have messages from the wallet provider, assuming you used a web wallet.

I'm mostly both of these.

I'm confused, url implies it was 2005 but the article says 2008, after the white paper was released.

Wyre in the Edge wallet is only 1%. Limited to ACH though

Transfers between gdax and coinbase should be instant. If you see the money in gdax but your getting that error try to remove some pennies from the total. I love gotten that error before and that's how I've gotten around it. It might be a rounding error, as silly as that sounds.

My only advice for you is to not take advice from anyone through direct message. Keep your questions general and public and do the necessary research to safely acquire the coins for your friend.

I went there to celebrate $2k and $4k and have plans to go back at $10k. It's a bit of a hike otherwise I'd go more often. Damn good pastrami.

Gdax withdrawals are low fee because they cover the cost for you. Next time, convert your btc to ltc - &gt; move to bittrex - &gt; convert to btc

Since no has answered your question your coins are fine. Worst case scenario is the transaction eventually gets dropped from the mempool and your coins are still in gdax. You're not at risk of losing anything. This could take several days to a week but it's more likely that the transaction gets mined by then

You have to deposit money into gdax, wait for it to clear, and then purchase crypto. This is slightly different than you're used to in coinbase. And yes, if you enter a price and an amount of crypto gdax will calculate the cost in dollars but you'll need to have at least that amount deposited already

I haven't used the hidden wallet functionality before but wouldn't all the coins be recoverable by entering the seed into a compatible wallet?

Lightning isn't strictly a two party system. If you, A, has a channel open with B and B also has a channel open with C, you can interact with C through B without directly opening a channel with C.
Take a newton's cradle, for instance. The first ball never touches the fifth but its kinetic energy is transferred through balls 2, 3, and 4.

Wouldn't a minority of nodes still be able to support the 2x chain?

Gemini credits your account instantly. Obviously, you have to wait for the funds to clear before withdrawing the btc but you would've been in at the lower price.

I agree, I don't recommend that plan either :) I understand you will do what you want with your money but I'd like to give you some unsolicited advice: don't give money to people who promise to make you money. People make money for themselves. Cloud mining doesn't make sense to me and in regards to bitconnect, consider how much new money needs to keep entering the system to support those interest rates. It's unsustainable. Early adopters will make money but the majority will lose. Did you get in early enough? /opinion

You control your private keys so you are ok. No extra steps necessary.

You might be able to pay with a crypto backed debit card. I plan on doing this soon myself but I won't be getting rid of the debt immediately I'm replacing my normal payments with crypto. I'm doing this for two reasons, first, I haven't found a debit card with great reviews I can trust with substantial sums of money. Second, I (personally) believe the value of my holdings will rise and I will spend less on my loan payments over time, saving me crypto.

They suspended my lurker account for, presumably, reporting the fake accounts. What a joke.

How do I follow the Coinlab case? IIRC the  US case is pending the Japan case but I can't find any public information on that one.  Are there dockets I can follow along?

Each wallet in Edge has its own private seed and is accessible in the menu next to each wallet. 
As for going out of business, as long as you've logged into your account once on your device you can still access it if their authentication servers are down. Your username and password are enough to decrypt the local data and you can see your wallets and seeds.

If the app is already on your device it won't go away if it's pulled from the app store. It's on your device forever until you uninstall it.
