Oh it's a bubble, it's going to crash
Being sarcastic

Bitcoin is not a bubble. And if you think Bitcoin is going burst into nothing, then you are wrong. Bitcoin have had 4 different crashes before we even reach to 10k. But everytime Bitcoin crashes, it strive back even harder Why? Because Bitcoin fill the needs of the people: Fast and secure, low transaction fees, borderless, empower the users, and anyone can use it without a third party trying to take profit. Imagine a world with one currency, and we are no longer being controlled by evil corporations, and corupted government (the problems of most Third World Countries). Everyone could finally live in a free and equal world . So, if you call Bitcoin a bubble, then let me correct your mistake: Bitcoin is not a bubble, it is a revolution.

Cheers up man. You messed up, but, it is all going to be ok. Get your head together, focus on what's important: your family. Money is just a concept, a tool that helps us throughout the day. Losing money is experience, and it's fine. 2 years from now, it won't even matter that you lost some money. Go to your wife, and say your sorry. Say you would do anything to make it up to her, and you would never betrayed her trusts again. Give it some time, but focus on her and your family from now on. I just want you to walk over this, look at the bigger picture and put your heart to what is important. Cheers up man, you can fix this, be strong

Too many FUD on this sub. Unsub
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:01:59
The same would happen with any other thing yea? I offer to buy shoes for $400/each. Next week, someone offer $500/each. Next week, someone offer $1000/each? You see where Im going with this. Next week, someone could offer to buy breads, water, etc. How is this a valid example of free market, or any market 
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:50:46
Why the fuck, would a bunch of rich stupid greedy cunts risk lowering their worth by creating a dip? Remember Bitcoin has been around for 8 years now, it's not like a new fresh delicious fruit in the market. I bet you there are more than 20% of Wall Street are already in Bitcoin, and that's a lot. And now you assuming that the price is gonna dip because more liquidity? Are u spreading FUD? Nice try bud.Sell your coins and watch tomorrow new all time high
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:57:53
I did. Gain x3 past month. Big reason is my bank would pay $15 interest, and tax $5 from it on a monthly basis. So yea, nahh banks are the greedy one

In 5 year, I would be buying grocery in Bitcoin. I know, it's crazy right 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:53:29
There you go. Just a push, and they all show their true intention. Nice FUD mate
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:24:16
Do it, buy 1 coin and hold 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:01:24
If u see it's going $20,000 by Christmas, then why hesitating? The point of holding is not to sell for a long period, so why does it matter if the price go up or down tomorrow? When you trying to buy the dip, Bitcoin goes up another 20%. Therefore, unless you can see the future, hodling is the best option. 2 years from now, people would wish they bought bitcoin at $20,000
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:04:04
Pretend that Bitcoin works? Where have you been past 8 years new comer. You think we got here by luck? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:37:43

Why? Why does Bcash and Roger Ver advertise itself as the real Bitcoin Core? Bitcoin Cash official website is Bitcoin.com? Why Roger Ver go on national television shit talked Core, and promote about how great his project is? Why Roger Ver tweeted mean words to Andreas? And after the tweet, he went on reddit blabbing abt how he made Andreas a millionare, and Andreas should be graceful to him? Why does everytime Bitcoin underperform, /rbitcoincash trash core, and promote their Bitcash as the real Bitcoin? Why Bcash Fuders tell people to invest all their Bitcoin to Bcash on Nov 11? Do you know how many people lost their savings on that day? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:22:31
The reason why Bitcoin price is going down, is because high demand and lack of hardware and software supports. What if next year, a company founded a better BTC mining chip that can work 200x better than our current one? Or what if developers of Bitcoin finally succeed in Lightning network? I will tell you what happen, Bitcoin's price will sky-rocket. People tend to overthink moments like this, but a month, a year from now; all these dips won't even matter. Enjoy Christmas, spend sometime on yourself, make some new friend, read a book.

Down, means less people using Bitcoin for commerce, less people transferring bitcoin; compared to previous period which is a holiday season. Outside of West countries, Asians countries are known for popular commerce using Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:31:38
Too many FUD today. If Bitcoin buyers can't control their emotions in time like this, they should not be here when drop happens, or just don't have any Bitcoin at all

CME Future is coming 2nd week of Dec. Last CME the price of Bitcoin goes up by 20%-30%. My advice to you is: HODL. Bitcoin is not a bubble, the price will hit $15k by the end of this year. Control your emotions, everything is going to be fine

The biggest obstacle of gold is its physical existence. For the Nazi to send its golds to its allies, they shall have to establish a course of transportation (sea, or land), which requires years of construction, the taking of land (that they do not owned). That golds need to be stored and protect, therefore cost more. However, Bitcoin costs Nazies almost nothing (no special protection, no special storage), it can be sent instantaneously, and can be traded for real value. It's 2017 Bitcoin is (new) Godl
