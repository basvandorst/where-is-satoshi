Powers that made it go to 20k will try to benefit again some time in the future , so It is very likely it will go up again, also as we get nearer the 21 million supply the race to hoard it will go into a frenzy mode in a few years.

This is like being stopped for speeding and getting charged  10 cents for every mile over the limit.

What he fails to realize is seashells have no value to some people yet, only used as a currency in some remote islands, and ancient cultures.  Bitcoin are digital seashells used by a big chunk of the population and financial exchanges as the backbone of their infrastructure.  He might be a billionaire and very smart but so are are lot of people making erroneous judgments on a tiny amount of research , and a lot of erroneous and contradicting information out there.

All the miners, traders, sellers and buyers in classifieds, online payment processors like skrill, dwolla , exchanges, daytraders ,as expensive as it is to use as a currency its still has a lot of usage as money and as store of value.  Its not going to go away anytime soon.  All this drop of price is drawing in more people , hopefully whenever BTC decides to move up again it will reward its user base very well.

Well it functions as a store of value if you invested significally when it was a at a lower price, I jumped in at $600 BTC and $7 into ETH, so hardly anything shakes me off.  Learned the hard way when I let go 40% BTC when it dropped from 600 to 400$ , never Again.  People who jump in now at 7k-9k range are going to be well of in 3 years or less when BTC goes for another run.

A massive influx of people are getting into crypto, what they paid is negligible compared to what they are making in fees.  A lot of newcomers might get putoff by this and pullout.
I remember in 2013 when the Mt.Gox hack happened I was about to go all in December and lost all confidence in cryptos until 2015 which in retrospect I could have made a decent amount of money.
Basically it good PR for them to do this.

Dammit im pissed I dint look into this back in 2009 when it started getting mentioned in forums, I always been an early adopter  in p2p stuff, i even had mp3 collections in 1996, somehow  i overlooked since its so hard to grasp at first.
Runing a bitminer now I setup an hour ago , i might make 32 cents by 2014.

ok created account, i cant beleive i missed the bitcoin bandwagon i been online  tons of hours , and just started learning on bitcoins and the history , i guess it got lost on all the stuff out there, it was in my radar in 2011 but i never looked into it until now that  its gaining more and more popularity.
Any mining succes stories?

paypal actually saved you money by shutting your account, think fo all the bit coins you would have given away.
