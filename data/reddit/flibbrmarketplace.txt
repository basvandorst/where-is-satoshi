Hi Guys, I like your site, but I feel really let down by this article. I used to use the blockchain wallet, but compared to ... blockchain wallet isn't shit.  The Samourai wallet has alot of stealth features, reusable payment codes, never reuses the same address and has remote access, and yet isn't on your site.  Epic fail. 
@_date: 2016-04-11 13:45:13

No. Every indication right now is fees will continue to rise.
Increase user base trying to all transact and fit inside the same small blocks is too much demand, not enough supply.  
Fees are priced in BTC, as price goes up, the $ of the fees go up. So if BTC doubles in price and transactions per day stays the same, the $ of the fees will double. If the user base also increase, fees will go up even more again. It will continue until fee's are just ridiculous and people refuse to use btc because of it.

When people bought +$260.. and price was back at $50 (1/5 of the original top price)... buying at $260 seemed mental.. I remember speaking to a guy who bought $260 mark.. he said he would just hold and hope it got back up there.. and it did.. real soon.  
  
The equivalent would be buying $1100 (stamp) and watching it fall to $220.. and holding... hoping, wondering if it'll ever go back up there. . . just to put things into perspective.
@_date: 2014-09-15 22:31:33
Getting access to buy it.   
Because fiat is reversible.. and bitcoin payments aren't.. anytime someone wants to buy bitcoin (online obviously) they have to go through all these fraud checks and screening etc.. which basically is a high level of friction vs just paying with their credit/debit card.

Nice update Oliver. Can't believe that Mtgox only just 'found' the btc when you pointed it out, after the community saw it being moved around.. then transfered to an 'online wallet'. . just totally backwards. As your letter says, these fools cannot be trusted with these assets. Karpeles needs to get locked in a cage and have his ass hole ripped up. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:29:39
Karpeles said himself the coins were not 'lost'. . just 'temporarily unavailable'. . . he couldn't access the coins because of lost keys..etc (baseless speculator theory).. then temporarily unavailable would be out of the question. 
@_date: 2014-04-25 16:01:09
Yup. Oliver is over there with lawyers paying out of his back pocket right now to fight for all of MtGox customers.. as he's also taken the good seat in the past to help MtGox customers... and he's trying to get BTC returned directly ... good work Oliver.

I'm just saying, your out here saying its not the same as github, I'm saying, "have you check it? Do you know for sure or just saying that". . 
    


   
Not your saying sometimes it is.. sometimes it isn't ? Hmm...  Why not impossible (nothing ever is) ..  this all just seems pretty loose wishy washy without any real meat or substance to back it up.  
     
and.. "where an order existed?" .. what, an order for what ? There is nothing to order on blockchain.info so I don't know what order your talking about that exists..   
   


   
While yes, this is technically correct... but so it is technically correct to say any online.. or offline wallet software could.. even the main bitcoin-qt program itself could do this. 
What you did say however, to my reference that blockchain.info doesn't have access to your private keys was that;  


   
Well, until there is proof it is untrue, the statement remains true.

How come the MtGox Books balanced at the end of 2013... and yet within 2 months of 2014... all coins and cash were gone ?  
  
Also... You needed to be verified to withdraw BTC on MtGox.. thus... those users who committed withdrawal fraud - using the malleability issue .. would have to be raising alot of support tickets with the same issue... which surely would have looked suspicious.. but also they would have to have become verified and submitted their AML details.

OKCoin not only has the highest volume, but also the most sophisticated trading platform with algorithmic trading..    
  
People all day long cry 'fake', but really, if you have a trading engine with 0% fees, really fast api to allow for HFT trading (unlike say stamp/finex/btc-e..etc) and advanced algorithmic trading orders, then this is what you get, high volume.  
  
People cheer lead people like bitstamp, who recently won the 'tech innovation awards', how I don't know when their site is slow, laggy and severely lacking innovation.  
  
Also worth noting is OKCoin took on the blockchain CTO, they have also bought in a bitfinex style P2P margin system and re also prioritising USD markets and bitcoin options.

As per Karpeles on bitcointalk...  "98% of our customers coins are stored offline in wallets generated offline and the keys stored separate locations".  
  
This should go down in history as the first time one of these offline secure generated wallets somehow 'leaks' into another wallet (the hot one).. and even though the Gox accounts balanced at the end of 2013... in 2 months.. all funds were drained...  Incredible. Absolutely incredible.

Yes, far more volume is being sold everyday on the exchange... but is that people trading, or people selling BTC and sucking that fiat out of the exchange to pay for bills...etc ? 
People say merchant adoption creates selling pressure; Because it sells BTC and sucks the fiat out of the exchange.
  
If I have a monthly trading volume of 2000 btc a month, is that btc being 'sold every month' or just traded back and forth ? 
  
So, like I said, sell 3,600 btc a every day on exchanges and suck that money out and don't put it back in, then we'd see how long the price holds up. I mean we'd be talking 25,000 coins getting sold a week.  Thats $15m a week (at $600) getting sucked out of exchanges. Do you think price will stay at $600 ? I think it'd be smashed down.  . . 
@_date: 2014-03-04 11:01:04

Well.. we know the merchant accepts BTC... so we know the coins r getting sold. Where do you think they're getting sold ?  OTC ? What.. so bitpay / coinbase have a shared OTC order book with bids/asks they're filling ?  How does t he OTC order book stay in line with exchanges ?    
   
How about you prove you know what they're doing with the coins or you STFU ? 
@_date: 2014-06-19 14:52:20


  
  
Like I said, you have a good exchange on your door stop, buy you dump those coins on it everyday and suck that much fiat out the exchange the price won't be where it is now in a weeks time.  


 
As I said before, daily volume on exchanges does not mean 3,600 coins woth of fiat is being taken out of exchanges and not being put back in every day.   
  
Example, if I trade $1m worth of trade volume a month.. does that mean I took out $1m of fiat from exchanges or just traded back and forth to the tune of $1m ... approx 2000 BTC ?

The only way I can see them being sold off exchange would effect the price would be if they were then transfer to an exchange then sold on the exchange. But if the % difference between the discounted bulk rate and the final price once the coins were market sold amounted to $0 then there would be no reason to sell and thus the price would remain unaffected.  
  
Ultimately leading to happy miners offloading bulk (market hammering) coins at a good cost, happy bulk buyers getting a discount for regular bulk buys and happy exchanges not getting 3,600 btc's worth of fiat sucked out every day.

So, 3,300 coins out of the 10,000 go to new coin funds ? (you choose the coins (your buddys coin!)) ~ and the remaining 6,666 go to pay you and your investors ?

You make it rain a boatload of BTC and thus in turn decide to pay yourselves even more... I don't see how any extra effort is required on your behalf if you raise 1,000 btc or 21,500 btc... yet you take more and more out the honey pot..

Volume != fiat being permentantly removed from exchanges to pay for miners bills..etc  
  
There is a difference between trading 3,600 coins a day.... and people selling 3,600 coins and taking the fiat out and not injecting it back in in a future trade.     
  
I can trade 2000 BTC's worth of volume in a month, does it mean I have 2000 btc. No. Does it mean I took out 2000 btc's worth of fiat from the exchange. No.

But any kind of voting, 'yes/no' or 'party X / party Y / party Z' for example can only be at best case scenario 51% (okay 50.0001..etc) .. beating the 49%.

How can we stop something like child porn and murder for hire etc though? I think distributed marketplace is the nuts but I dont want it to be a tool for violence or sick paedophiles. No.. this is not a 'bitcoin is used by paedophiles' troll post but a genuine concern i think we have to think about and how to tackle it.
Edit: Its also worth noting, I'm not saying "omg look we must control tech which is actually amoral". . what I'm saying is; We have the power to issue a law unto ourselves. Now do we use the power to create an amoral tool. Sure. But do we then have a responsibility to ensure that tool does not get utilized for the most evil of human acts ? I believe we do. How we go about realising that responsibility is something I don't have the solution for, but I think we should be discussing. 
Edit 2: It is honestly disappointing to be downvoted for wanting to talk about something which is very serious and real.. and ultimately something we should be considering.  We should be upvoting this to bring it to the forefront of our minds so we can discuss, talk and think about it ~ and what our collective minds can come up with as a solution to an obvious problem that's going to arise.

Yes but this is off blockchain.. so this isn't something bitcoin can deal with yes.
I propose the solution would be to great a special kind of address, like we have a normal address and multi sig address, lets have a 'subscription address', where by we can create an key for that address, with an associated value and time which then allows people to pull from that address a maximium of &lt;value&gt; each specified &lt;time&gt;.

But people are going to use this for very bad things.. like childporn, slavery, murder for hire.. and such, and that is a responsibility we should be thinking about and discussing. .  not just repeating the mantra that the tech is amoral and we are not responsible for how its used...  it would be like, creating something which kills all dogs in a 1 mile radius.. then releasing it, saying the tool is amoral, blame the users of it. As the maker, we have a responsibility to ensure it is used for good, not evil.

I have always thought he has just mined the coins and just binned the prv key for them. Good work if he/she/they have done that.
I'd have preferred if he split it into 100k x 1btc addresses though as super computers (quantum) become more common in the future and such.. I have read it might be better for miners to try and compute the prv keys of monster addresses than to mine blocks..etc
IF ever those coins do get moved, I agree, your right, people would just start dumping. 
It would be funny though he just came along and just reduced every exchange to like $10.

then the merchant would 'accept the btc'.. and by that we mean, let coinbase/bitpay accept the btc and dump into fiat to send to the merchant.... then the merchant has to resend that fiat back to the exchange, rebuy the btc (fee's?), when assuming the price doesn't go down between when they buy the coin and when they pay supplier, then pay the supplier the coin who then also just uses bitpay/coinbase who then just dumps again for fiat.... the whole thing sounds incredibly laborious.

3,600 coins mined a day, 30,000+ a week. Do you see this being sold on exchanges at full price ?  
  
The price would be sub $50 within a week.. then when there are 30,000's worth to sell next week, they price would be $50 instead of $500+ because it just got the shit dumped out of it.   
  
Thus, it makes sense to sell bulk off exchange at a slightly discounted price than smashing the price for next time.

Well.. I'm not saying their going to shut up shop.. and I'm not saying their not.. what I am trying todo is just point out the facts..  
 
That is, the USD withdrawl issue is clearly known about, the BTC withdrawal issue was along time building up and technically provable... they have been shown to be working on a solution, fiat withdrawals are still coming out, 'big names' seem to be in a semi positive mood, Karpeles himself has personally backed up funds from his own pocket before.. Trying NOT to sound like cheerleading.. however.. given the constant barage of doomer mongering.. it might come accross that way..
 
 
But really I'm saying I don't know, but to me.. if you ignore the constant spew of FUD.. and accept their competency at face value.. that is the side of it.. make of it what you will.. 
 
At the end of the day.. I know next to nothing.. and what I do know is probably wrong anyway..  but at least it's more than people claiming insolvency as fact when they also know nothing.

The only negative experiences are;   
   
1. Connectivity to the .cn exchange sometimes would go down for hours for me but be able to be accessed to other people from around world... any UK proxy would be unable to connect but a Hong Kong VPN could connect but was too slow to be worth using. This is the reason I left .cn 
   
2. Connectivity issues and lag with the .com site... I know they have had alot of growth lately but I have sometimes I had issues where I have major lag and can't open/close positions... on 10x futures during volatile times this can be incredibly frustrating. [See video](    
   
I had some usability issues with how the margin trading works on the .cn site which I have also spoke to them about... ie: If I want to go from margin long to margin short... I have to take out loans in advance for both and start paying 0.1% a day on each long and short position.... which sucks.. there is no 'instant margin' mode...   
   
Apart from that yeah.. they are good at communicating with their users and getting things done which is a refreshing change from the other exchanges out there.. plus they employ good people which inspires confidence also.

Seems logical to me. If your looking to buy alot of coins, you might go to a pool given you can identify the pools but have no way of identifying a large miner. 
 


  
Margins are narrow ~ Disagree with this one  here. Too many variables and too subjective an opinion. 
With regards to selling at a discount, as I've already said, if you have alot of coins to be sold to pay for bills, if you sell on exchange you hammer down price.. if you go off exchange bulk, buyers are few and far between and will want a discount.

.. so you can understand how coins are bought and sold in bulk off exchange.  
  
Why do you then believe that these coins bought in bulk will be sold at a premium to market price ?  
This is absolutely deluded.
If anything they will be sold at a reduction of market price because there is so many to constantly offload and to do so on an exchange would hammer down the current price and price for future sales. 
  
With regards to existing contracts, I don't know why your so rigidly stuck like straight iron rod in your belief system. Maybe the seller has a contract with coinbase, but coinbase has lower demand that month and buys less and they have surpless left over they'd like to offload.   
  
Like I said, if your looking to buy bulk coins;
 You don't buy on an exchange.
 You find sellers with surplus &amp; requirement to unload (eg: Miners to pay bills). 
 You don't buy above market price.
It really is that simple. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 19:18:11

Orders of magnitude.
a $100 swing (which has been regularly happening down here) is 1/3 the price.... equal to a $300 swing at $1000.  So trading conditions are brilliant.  
  
To me... I'm long, but I'll trade the current range to increase my BTC for long term outlook.. and like I said, orders of magnitude make the current trading range attractive and profitable.

Whether 3,600 are mined by one miner or not, are we seeing 3,600 getting sold on exchanges every day  ? No.  
  
Where's the rest of them...  some small miners may choose to take the hit on the bills and hold the coins with hope, large multi $m miners would be more inclined to sell the coins and pay bills and reduce risk of holding.. maybe just holding profit as coins..etc if they wanted.

The problem is, that every single guy who has Child Porn out there is going to say, "fcuk! Rather than list on some website no one knows about, I'm going to list that I can sell all this Child Porn publicly for all paedophiles out there in the world to see so they can buy it".. then they will do the same.  Thus, they will ditch their old school websites with traceable credit cards and servers and go for this because it is a superior product for this kind of content distribution / advertisement. . .  So, whatever right ? We just let them start ramming loads of Child Porn on this unstoppable marketplace creating a persistent easily accessible market for this content ? Well.. u know what. Fuck Child Porn. Fuck Paedophiles. There's alot of sick fucks out there and "we need to do something about it". 
How we go about achieving that, while maintaining a system which will allow for what we want, I don't know the solution, but thats what I'm saying, we should be thinking about it.

New York-based bitcoin trading platform Atlas ATS is partnering with a small U.S. stock exchange to expedite a regulatory approval process that has stymied the development of digital-currency exchanges in the U.S.
Under an agreement to be announced Wednesday, the National Stock Exchange, which is owned by the CBOE Holdings, CBOE +1.33%  Inc. and is recognized by the Securities and Exchange Commission as a self-regulatory organization, or SRO, will write and enforce the rules governing how Atlas's exchange functions.
Once the two parties have agreed to those rules and surveillance procedures, Atlas will become the first bitcoin marketplace to be regulated by a "quasi-government entity," Atlas Chief Executive Officer Shawn Solves said.
That should mean it can bypass the time-consuming process currently confronting other budding bitcoin exchanges, such as Kraken and CoinMkt, both of San Francisco.
Those other exchanges have been forced to seek money-transmitting licenses from nearly all 50 U.S. states following instructions provided in October by the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN. In that guidance, FinCEN said federally regulated entities would be exempt from those requirements.
It isn't clear how the SEC, which doesn't regulate bitcoin, might respond to Atlas's use of the National Stock Exchange's SRO status to earn this exemption. The SEC declined to comment for this article.
In a statement, Atlas said its rule book would be based on SEC-approved rules used by U.S. stock and option exchanges. These establish requirements for record books, the segregation of customer accounts, security of assets and other standards.
For the all-electronic National Stock Exchange, or NSX, the move could deliver a new source of revenue and relevancy in an industry increasingly dominated by far bigger exchanges such as IntercontinentalExchange ICE +1.62%  Group and its NYSE-Euronext unit and Nasdaq OMX NDAQ +3.21%  Group.
NSX traces its roots to the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, founded in the 1880s. The NSX so far this month has averaged just 0.2% of daily stock-trading volume in the U.S., according to data provided by BATS Global Markets Inc., a competitor to NSX.
An NSX president, Francis Corcoran, declined to comment.
Atlas's Chairman, William Karsh, is currently listed as a special adviser to the NSX. He said the decision to work with Atlas was made entirely by NSX Chairman and CEO David Harris. "I was instrumental in explaining what the industry around virtual currencies was all about, but that's about the extent of my involvement," Mr. Karsh said.
Atlas functions like an automated bitcoin trading system, providing rapid-fire, anonymous matching services for clients such as high-frequency trading firms, though it isn't formally regulated as an ATS by the SEC. Atlas also offers a public exchange where prices are broadcast to all market participants.
Launched last month with links to sister exchanges in Hong Kong and Singapore, the marketplace is currently processing 7,000 to 10,000 transactions a day while the public exchange is handling volume of just 100 to 1,000 trades a day, Mr. Solves said.
Atlas's launch coincides with efforts by other Wall Street-connected firms, such as private exchange SecondMarket Inc., to develop robust, high-tech and regulated bitcoin exchanges for professional investors. These are presented as alternatives to the Internet-based offshore retail exchanges that currently dominate digital-currency trading and whose vulnerabilities were highlighted by the collapse of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox in February.
Bitcoin's price soared to a peak of $1,145 in early December. However, it has since fallen below $500, according to a Coindesk index, following a string of negative developments, including the Mt. Gox bankruptcy.

@_date: 2014-06-19 15:48:19
Yes I agree with everything you just said; However, it would only effect the price if it had partaken in the price discovery process; By remaining absent from the exchange ~ and thus price discovery process ~ It is merely following the price others have/are setting, thus, even though that particular buyer is not on the exchange and thus removed from the buyer side, he has not effected the price because the price has already been set by others...

Also, a site like paypal, it lets you list all the items you want, racks up the fees, then charges you the amount at the end of every month. It takes this money automatically.
This is convenient for both paypal.. and the users...  Getting the users to do this manually each time would provide less revenue for paypal purely because it would involve each user having to repay everytime when the idea of the company is to minimize the friction to payment.
IF bitcoin had a subscription based service, I'm sure the porn industry would also be more attracted to it.

Yeah I agree the .cn sites UI is not a scratch on what it should be.. Their .com futures UI is way better though.. but yeah I have been telling OKC for ages to upgrade that and I have been told be that they do have a hew dedicated UI designer

Absolutely EXCELLENT write up and analysis. 
I looked through your tagged addresses but couldn't distinguish between sheep market place tagged addresses and gox addresses... ? I you said you taxxed them with 777 but I could only find one incoming payment with 777, but pages and pages with the 787. 
I noticed some of the tagged addresses seem to have paid known addresses... could we not request the known addresses reveal the identify of whoever paid them from X address for the worth of the community and $0.5bn worth of missing gox funds..
Also... you seem sure the thief is Karpeles.. now, this is my own assumption also, based on;  Cold wallets don't leak... how do you lose 5% of all the BTC in the world and become totally unaware of it until the last moment. I just can't believe this to be the case.   
  
So... how can you be so confident in the Karpeles is the one who stole the btc ?   
  
Also... what % of the missing BTC have you 'tagged'... 50% ? 100% ? . . and when was all the missing btc moved ? 
  
Do you have google plus / skype etc ?

A person who sets up / creates a profile specifically for their selling and buying of child porn... they want to build a reputation for providing their child porn... and those who buy from them could use specific child porn purchasing accounts they would setup not their normal accounts.. 
  
So.. I think claiming 'ostracism' here is completely mute and worthless. There is no one and nothing to ostracise.. only anonymous profiles who actually want to be seen as being good providers of content and those buying the content who will most like be peoples child porn purchasing specific accounts.

3,600 coins are mined every day. 30,000+ every week. 
  
If miners sold 3,600 coins a day on the exchange to pay for bills, price would be at $50 within a week.   
  
If miners sell off exchange at say, 10% discount, the exchange price can stay high for when they sell tomorrows batch of coins.   
Why would miners sell at 10% discont off exchange price ? ~ Well if they dumped the coins to pay bills, they'd kill the price, they also have alot to get rid of and people buying in bulk like a discount, there's also a limited pool of potential customers.  
Thus, I would say to you; Why would anyone pay above market rate for coins they can buy elsewhere for below market rate ? 
@_date: 2014-12-10 11:22:37
Yes

No, because that would be using a traditional style address.
The scheme i'm describing involves a whole new address, where by you give the subscription based service 'a key - of some kind' which allows them to withdraw a maximium of X with a frequency of X time.  Giving them your private key would obviously mean they could justp ull all funds they wanted, which is obviously not what i'm describing.

Basically the whale has been defending 650... 640... 635... 630... and yesterday / this morning put on the squeeze and sensing weakness.. put a big fat ask wall up...  
People paniced in fear and sold it down.. there weren't any asks infront of his wall so he loaded up a whole range of 20 btc asks infront of his wall... once people paniced again and refilled his 2 x 200 btc bids at 610 he then cancelled all asks.. and I suspect those are his coins now at 620.
He might have gone to bed now... possibly put in a big bid wall to help him clear those coins, but I doubt it... let this new price range bed in a bit, defend 620-625.. then either let the market just naturally sell it down or put up his asks walls again and force some more action.
If you play the whales game.. he will win.

I understand what your saying .. and agree with you. Building the tech which is completely amoral shouldn't be restricted by what bad people might post on it. . you know, I'm down with, this, I absolutely 100% agree.  
  
BUT... it still means people can and will use it for these bad things.  
  
So.. do we have a responsibility ? Its personal opinion of course, but I think would personally. If I developed OpenBazaar and it helped spread and make more accessible indecent images of children and such like this, I would feel guilty and bad about that.. and want to stop that side of it.. so that would be where and how I would come to feel responsible. 
I agree with you on Assassination Market, better for the job yes. 
So what is the solution to prevent people from using it for such evil purposes ? I don't know. Maybe those who develop could put equal amount of time in a scanning / listening app that looks out for child porn and then automatically builds profiles and emails them to authorities.. I don't know the solution. But i'm looking for ideas and community engagement as to other peoples ideas..  which is what I was hoping to bring out with the OP

Thanks  
----------------------------------  
  
A group of investors with Hollywood ties is seeking to revive bankrupt bitcoin-trading exchange Mt. Gox, according to people familiar with the matter.  
  
The investor group, which includes Brock Pierce, a former child actor-turned technology entrepreneur, is offering a token payment of one bitcoin, or about $400, to buy the exchange outright, according to these people. The acquisition must be approved by a Japanese bankruptcy court.  
  
Mt. Gox collapsed in February after disclosing that 750,000 bitcoins belonging to customers had vanished, along with an additional 100,000 bitcoins owned by the virtual-currency exchange. Since then, about 200,000 bitcoins have been recovered and are part of the exchange's assets.  
  
The investor group hopes to revive the exchange and set aside 50% of its transaction fees to pay back burned customers and other creditors over time, according to documents filed to the Japanese bankruptcy court and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.  
  
The near-zero valuation of the proposed deal could to be a hurdle in bankruptcy court.  
  
According to people familiar with the plan, the group is justifying the low price because of the "information vacuum" over Mt. Gox's 550,000 missing bitcoins, currently worth about $220 million. It isn't possible to place a value on the lost coins, they said.  
  
Creditors, who have been stuck in limbo since their accounts were frozen, would have the option of receiving a prorated payment from the 200,000 recovered bitcoins, an estimated 20% recovery value on their claims, or receiving the equivalent amount in equity in the new exchange.  
  
Launched in 2009, bitcoin is a computer-driven currency that isn't backed by a central bank. Users "mine," or create, bitcoins by tapping high-powered computers to answer complex mathematical problems. The coins are stored in digital wallets that have proven to be susceptible to hacking.  
  
Bitcoin's price soared to more than $1,100 in November before plunging as Chinese government officials clamped down on bitcoin trading and Mt. Gox lurched toward bankruptcy. The Tokyo exchange halted customer withdrawals in dollars last year, and in February stopped allowing customers to withdraw money in any currency.  
  
The potential revival of Mt. Gox, which had struggled with technical problems for months before its collapse, comes at a critical time for the virtual currency. A wave of big investors are pouring money into startup bitcoin businesses, but price volatility and regulatory scrutiny are creating uncertainty about the currency's long-term prospects.  
  
Mr. Pierce, 33 years old, appeared in "The Mighty Ducks" movie series in the 1990s, and has since become an investor focused on technology companies.  
  
Other investors in the group include venture capitalists William Quigley, the managing director of Santa Monica, Calif.-based Clearstone Venture Partners and a former financial director Disney Inc.'s licensing businesses; and Matthew Roszak, a partner at Chicago-based SilkRoad Equity, a venture-capital firm. John Betts, who ran electronic trading platforms at Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., would be the chief executive of the proposed new firm, according to the plan.

Why is he a criminal ?   
 Innocent until proven guilty.  
 Even if he did host the website, so what ? He just hosted a site that allowed buyers and sellers to connect with each other, buyers and sellers are responsible for their own actions, he cannot be expected to police thousands of users anymore than google can be expected to be held accountable for all the 'illegal' stuff they find themselves linking to.  
 Even if you want to argue he is a criminal for hosting the site, who gives a fuck ? Its basically removing the violence and improving the quality / customer service of 'drug' supplies to fulfil customer demand. He helped remove harm from the war on drugs and lower costs and improve quality for buyers. Who has a right to tell anyone else what they can / can't put in their body when it doesn't effect them.

This is zero volume. Get real. Moron
@_date: 2014-02-02 21:18:55
This is a popular thing people like to shout about... and the counter to it IMO would go something like this;
Investors **LOVE** exchanges. They are incredibly profitable.. and allow exposure to capitalise the bitcoin eco system without actually exposing oneself to holding bitcoin.
Thus, Gox being such a prominent exchange, regardless of current volume...  would be an incredible attractive proposition for investors.
If Gox was in trouble and said, "hey, investors, we want your help". . I think there would be more than enough people saying "I'll put in X and help run things" . .  I think this is actually what they should do.
Bring in the big names like BitPay, Coinbase and Circle(Wtf have they done even?) have done.. bringing on the big names in BTC eco system.
They could bring in expertise in terms of finance, support and more..
So, for this reason, I think Gox's future is secure.

When gox went down, i said i wanted my btc back, not fiat, i tried to submit my claims form with kraken but the website repeatedly did not work, i emailed twice, messaged him on here multiple times, all with no luck, so now i have no claims. 
  
On top of this, you're now going to get all the btc through tibanne. Can you imagine how i feel, that you're the fraudster, I'm the innocent party, and you're running off happy with my btc while i'm getting nothing.

Altcoins offer little to no benefits over bitcoin and no one wants to develop anything for them because time is better spent doing things focusing on bitcoin.

I agree.. and with the freemarket in currencies now open (in a way that can't be shutdown like a centrally controlled new currency)... then crypto's will have to get better... faster transactions per second (like, unlimited), near instant one way secure confirmations, payment to labels, eg: JohnSmith not just Akm34Kah39u23jklsm ..  and such.

As a retailer:
I hate bidding [because big organisations with a more recognised brand name can bid more because they have a higher conversion rate]
I hate purchasing slots [because I need this ad to work]
BUT I LOVEEEE affiliate marketing, because this way, I only pay for those who actually do me some good, ie: generate sales, rather than just send me traffic. 
Also, I've been waiting for good bitcoin ad networks to start popping up for my site (in dev) : flibbr.com . . 
As an advertiser, I want whatevers going to pay the most ~ I think with displaying relevant affiliate links and / or retargetted advertising I can make it more specific to the user and thus earn more.

imagine bitcoin is the base..  there's no reason why you won't have payment solution providers who provide trusted offchain transactions which could be reversed if a user had a reason to use this [lack of trust in seller] and seller offered it as payment method [entice more customers]. .

SPV specifically is bad.
@_date: 2013-10-19 01:30:03
The closest is probably coinbase...  Pay in $.. get back BTC.. but to avoid all the chargeback risk and stuff they have to put on strict limits because obviously in the fiat world.. chargebacks are controlled by the bank.. and in the bitcoin world.. there is no chargeback..  so they ask the users to be verified and jump through all sorts of hoops to minimize the risk of the fiat purchase being chargebacked to them.

fiat currency = government issued currency..  so no, bitcoin is not fiat currency.
The value is derived by what someone's prepared to pay for it... what they're prepared to pay for it will be determined by many factors. .  eg: How useful are the bitcoins once I purchase them?

Any dollars transfer electronically and you run the risk of a chargeback.. unless it is bank transfer.. then you have todo it manually so incur costs in time and labour.. unless you can automate it.. at which point you need like an api from you bank and they will want $m in security... your systems will have to be like fort knox and such...

Also, why should I have to move somewhere else ?

@_date: 2013-09-21 20:33:04
yeah do it.. but incrementally.. and then tell the authorities you've been paying the money into BTC to pay an external subcontractor. 
*POOF*.... anndddddd its gone.

I  have been on your website before and liked the look of it, but I didn't sign up for these reasons;
* Lack of volume
* No way to deposit / withdraw fiat
* No chart showing order book depth and volume / price data for set period
I feel you need these to break into this market, also offering a fee credit scheme like mcxnow has helped push them into the forefront of peoples mind and seperate them from the competitors.
Overall, good luck. 
**Other Ideas I think you could implement to help speed up adoption** 
A troll box helps as well as it gets people to stay on your site longer.... and also do you use some kind of websocket to live ping / update the orderbooks in real time


Each entry doesn't tell me if the recent order was a sell or buy ? 
One more thing, maybe remove trailing zero's on the orders in the order book to help with readability (text align left) and bold up walls (similar to btc-e) is nice. 
Have bitcoinwisdom take on your feed so I can use their charting and such 
And later on ..  Feed / Export data type thing to feed into MT4

Yes, plus bitpay pays up the next day, new merchant processors for the banks usually have a 30day settlement period for the first 6months-1yr of trading.

BTC-e users are atleast honest about it, bitstamp users live in denial about it. . . bitstamp this bitstamp that while sitting there with the gox tab open watching the price.

Yes, with no bailouts, if your offering someone credit, your going to be highly vetted. The days of 'easy bad credit' would be gone.
Also, because your money is valuable if you just save it, when you do spend it, you only going to want to spend it on the most high quality - long lasting products. Thus forcing people to make products of a higher quality, for the most competitive price.. at the same time, driving up productivity &amp; innovation.

Amazon would be the best one to target IMO. Entirely online based and massive market share. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:18:08
It's just a necessary shake out to reaffirm the price point before making any new moves.. this plus more flowing in = expect new highs
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:15:51
You can either do it youself, see [here]( and [here]( using bitcoind.
There's also some websites that will do all the work for you, like this one: [Meklebar]( 
Hope it helps.

Yeah if compare the market cap of BTC vs amount of USD printed during this period, you could say BTC has got cheaper. hehe. 
@_date: 2013-11-02 23:10:30
It's not coinbases fault.. it's the fiat's fault.
Fiat has all these payment networks which can issue chargebacks... if they couldn't issue chargebacks.. then there would be no 'highrisk'.
Blame the banks, blame mastercard, blame visa... but coinbase are just doing their job to stay in business by minimizing all risk.

please sign up to my site;  ~ whats live now is months old and I've been pretty busy with new baby of late but it should be live in the next few weeks ~ total security revamp, featuring web wallets, BTC, LTC, PayPal. . 2.5% fee . .

The price of bitcoin will never - in the long term - go down - unless bitcoin itself is finished / overwith / done for. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:29:34
They won't need to.. bitcoins could become so strong that it would be the preferential form of payment. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:08:32
You can use bticoincharts.com or go to 'logarithmic' on bitcoinwisdom also. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:26:18
I always tell people to just buy 1 BTC.. I tell them, "Look, if you buy one and it comes to nothing, you lost $800, if it is the future of remittance and money, then you've done well, given the odds, its worth a shot" and generally people agree and buy one. .. and then get the bug and want more !

I think blockchain.info has a kind of bitcoind you can query via there api. . . 
You can also run bitcoind on the free tier AWS EC2 package. (But store your ~/.bitcoin file in a persistent EBS volume attached to the device)

I don't like this idea of cashing out from deflationary singularity bitcoin into printable paper fiat... prefer to just buy directly with my btc where possible.

What is a money ? A medium of exchange which can be traded easily inplace of trading ..  2 horses for 1 car (example!). With government issued money, there is no innovation. With bitcoin and privatised money, money becomes more efficient, cheaper &amp; easier to transmit ~ this is the beginning of the evolution of money. Where does it end ? Time? 
@_date: 2013-09-05 19:34:54
I agree.. more lines needed on this graph.

Someone's bot -  automated trading machine, just lost it on Gox..
Sold 100 BTC... bought 100 BTC... did this like 3 times.. buying high, selling low... 
Then started doing it with 200 BTC at a time
Then started doing it with 500 BTC at a time
Then started doing it with 2x 500 BTC orders at a time. . .  
buying high, selling low everytime, must have just cost someone literally like 100,000$ in fee's and lost revenue.. 
@_date: 2013-10-26 23:51:02
Because BTC-e users are scared chickens that tentatively follow up the BTC price with whatever Gox is doing.. then as soon as someone says 'crash' dump it down to kingdom come.
The good thing about this, is with the fee's lower than Gox and the swings bigger you can actually make alot more coin trading here.. .  but BTC-e does have a large amount of users that sit with their fingers on the market order sell button waiting for a Gox pull down and then mass dump . .  so, try not to be one of the one's that panic sells at the bottom. 
@_date: 2013-10-19 18:41:34
I agree.. let's just price everything in satoshi's from now on... so much easier.
