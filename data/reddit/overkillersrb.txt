They have IME which is essentially a propriatery backdoor.
IME is an ARM chip which can access everything on your pc even when it's turned off (i doubt this because it would jave to start up the hard drives which people would hear, but in any case libreboot claims so).

Boy do i have some news for you
@_date: 2017-08-16 07:30:58
Many do, but with the control of the narrative that is currently present they might as well not exist.
The open source nature of bitcoin is being killed by limiting information.
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:12:38
Wow, spoken like a true zealot, you even have that fire inside you true fanatics have, and it shows. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:11:58
Mobile wallets are MUCH LESS secure than a pc nonmining node, there are jusy so many attack vectors.
Well, mymonero is coming (made by a monero developer), however it does not tick all the boxes the community wants, namely not all of it is open source and some other concerns are there.
If you want to support development of a monero mobile wallet, go to the bounty thread and donate monero.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:14:04
That is literaly the way it was intended, what's best for bitcoin is incidentally also best for their money.

You fail to understand that ln will not be optional if blocks stay 1mb indefinitely.
Because you won't be able to afford the fees if the public rushes to btc. Only millionaires will be able to.
Both scenarios are equally scary.
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:56:26
I gotta say, while i don't like the censorship in r/bitcoin, i have to support core here.
2x is irresponsible, and a bad hack and bch is completely centralized.
I will still oppose censorship, and have concerns about lighting, but when it comes to economic support, bitcoin is the most obvious choce here.
r/btc had technical discussion and moral high ground some time ago, but at this point that is completely gone and it's just bullshit all the time.
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:51:00
You are right, segwit + 2x is a horrible hack, but at the same time, we can't ignore nakamoto consensus. 
We can only change economic support, but the name bitcoin stays with the longest chain.

@_date: 2017-08-18 06:11:41
It's the fundamental way bitcoin works.
Hashpower dictates thr biggest chain and that id bitcoin, this was said in the original whitepaper.
Now, also, economic support dictates mining profitability which in the end dictates the longest chain, but lately we are seeing some mining which isn't tied only to direct profitability.

Some believe it is already centralized by bitmain, since they are the only competent asic maker, and probably have created some proxy pools to hide the centralization of the network.

Running nodes does nothing, anyone can create thousands of them, using nodes for actual transactions is what matters.
And no, nodes don't need to be able to run on a raspberry pi, everyone who can get a pi already has a pc.
Leaving your node on does nothing for the network unless it's a mining one, but using a node for transaction ensures that economic majority is what is voting and not spv providers for you.
EDIT : We need nodes, to stop us accepting fraudelent activity, but the nodes cannot change that it is happening. 
So nodes are only useful as a way of economic voting. 
An spv provider might have a deal with the miners, and we could unwillingly accept fraud, this is why not trusting is neccecary.
But your raspberry pies are doing nothing for the network unless you actually have money on them that you will use.

By it's nature of linking channels, for instance if i want to pay mike 10$ but we both have a channel open with the same cofee shop, the transaction will go through the cofee shop.
Eventually this could create a situation where big consumer companies are the biggest nodes in the network everyone is connected to, centralizing the network.

It will be funny when the main chain of btc gets crippled for "decentralization", and everyone gets forced to use second layer solutions which can be manipulated.
Or when all your ln transactions go through McDonalds or CocaCola because you bought food there once and it's the biggest hub.
Also, bch could be just onecoin if it doesn't get decentralized.

Thanks for the answer, but i have a feeling anyone who does write a specification will be labeled as an attacker on bitcoin and a "troll", and shunned.

The author is talking about Bitcoin protocol spec, but Bitcoin Cash should have their protocol specification as well.

Of all the things blockchain has been applied to, cryptocurrency is the only one that really makes sense, so this is kind of ironic, everything that has been done with thr blockchain tech apart from it would have been done much better using a centralized system.
Also, JP Morgan and crew are trying to convince everybody that permissoned mutable blockchains are fine and better than the normal ones, which is one of the reasons they like Eth and Zec.
@_date: 2017-09-20 05:23:03

It's a gamble at this point, if the scaling problem is fixed you COULD have five times that not long from now, but i don't see it happening soon, and the state of bitcoin is shit right now.

Then they will continue getting rich on bitcoin by following the rules. 
That's not my bussiness as long as the system works well.
And if they don't follow the rules it will be quickly known and their bitcoins won't be worth shit.
Why would they suicide themselves that way?
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:47:40

Even if bitcoin were to remain digital gold, it would still need bigger blocks.

While i agree, you can argue that people can vote by choosing which pool they mine in.
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:44:51
A sybil attack, where the minority wants to overtake the chain.
By satoshi's whitepaper, uasf shouldn't even be a thing, because to vote you would need proof of work (mining).
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:36:11
Here is what i would do : Keep most of the new miners and prototypes for myself and mine with them, in addition to the mining hardware i already have, and point my miners to a wide variety of pools so it appears decentralized.

Do not hold tether, they are a scam.
Look it up.

Nobody should tell you what to do with your money. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 23:05:49
Do you really think i deleted it?
You must be new to the situation in r/bitcoin.
It is more secure because it is in miners interest to keep everything very very secure, and if you have an asic resistant algo (no algo is really asic resistant) then botnets will roam and it will be much less secure that way. Ordinary people and small miners have literaly no security.
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:52:48
Nobody gives a shit about that coin though
@_date: 2017-07-29 20:38:38
It never was.
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:32:32
Now you are using buzzwords to defend yourself from supporting a centralized mutable token, and a group of developers which openly support censorship?
@_date: 2017-05-27 18:45:39
Cannot be more true. 
Unfortunately, it seems like one side will inevitably win and bitcoin will be less decentralized.
@_date: 2017-05-15 21:50:26
Not when he has to pay a 2$ fee for 5$ of bread and wait half a day for the transaction to finish
@_date: 2017-07-06 11:33:20
All you have to do is make a more competent asic, and keep doing so until he has no marketshare and therefore no influence with miners.
Good luck with that.
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:21:21
So basically they fucking killed the point of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-09 11:20:58
What is the point of poker where you can't even see your opponent?

"The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest. If a greedy attacker is able to
assemble more CPU power than all the honest nodes, he would have to choose between using it
to defraud people by stealing back his payments, or using it to generate new coins. He ought to
find it more profitable to play by the rules, such rules that favour him with more new coins than
everyone else combined, than to undermine the system and the validity of his own wealth."
Jihan owning most of the hashrate is bad, but if he cares for his well being he won't use that to compromise the network.
@_date: 2017-07-09 16:32:18
That actually makes sense. Thanks for the explanation.
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:17:58
Litecoin has segwit.
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:47:58
Pgp is closed source.
Use gpg. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 12:48:29
This guy has no idea what he is talking about, that is just fear talking and it's understandable, but doesn't make for a good article.
@_date: 2017-07-02 09:51:03
Bitcoin can still exist as cash, for individual to individual trade.
Also for online shops.
@_date: 2017-07-05 06:53:21
This is good for bitcoin actually.
@_date: 2017-07-02 07:33:16
After 25 years, yeah.
Don't forget to replace the huge batteries every few years as well. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 09:37:37
So any criticism is FUD now? Seems like you would get along with Theymos
@_date: 2017-07-20 11:57:35
Segwit is a nececcary evil it seems.
It has huge technical debt though.
@_date: 2017-07-05 07:16:23
Yes. Just being out there as a name is a huge plus, no matter how much slander they throw.
@_date: 2017-07-01 12:13:31
Sure, he is a fraud
But, coming from samson? Wow
@_date: 2017-07-06 15:08:57
In the long run, there will always be mning centralization. We just have to limit the influence of the mining cartels, and we can only do that by economic voting (holding bitcoin or not).
@_date: 2017-07-06 12:30:28
You can never eliminate asics, it is always going to be most profitable to make an asic for a huge currency such as bitcoin, and even if you do then you have a problem with people running botnets.

Nobody owns the name Bitcoin.
Not core, not Satoshi, not you and me and the rest of us invested.

Where does Satoshi speak of payment channels?

Bitcoin was created to kill the man in the middle. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:57:12
Some day, there will be such a good book and movie about bitcoin. 
From cryptoanarchy and mysterious roots, to hacks, community divide, fraudsters and the government involment, all the way to an average joe buying his new car with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-01 17:24:50
You mean Satoshi? 
He is the sole creator and initial maintainer of bitcoin, then Gavin. 
Current core has nothing to do with the creation of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-11 07:16:39
China is anything but communist these days, they embraced capitalism long ago. 
My country has been through a communist dictatorship so i can kind of relate, but you are going far overboard.
China now is nothing like it used to be.

@_date: 2017-07-07 07:51:44
They are, just take a look at monero botnets. 
There are eth and zcash as well though.
But those are small fish, if bitcoin switched to "asic-resistant" algo 
1. There would be asics within a month, nothing is asic resistant 
2. There could be a very dangerous botnet (think stuxnet) from people who wish to either destroy bitcoin or get rich, and tons of amateur ones.

Was this subreddit not cancerous enough?
@_date: 2017-07-06 22:24:57
The mental acrobatics in this comment are impressive
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:43:59
This is just Hearn talking about what satoshi said. 
That isn't much of a proof.
It's like Gavin saying that Satoshi is csw.
@_date: 2017-07-06 22:58:38
We all know where Jihan wants to take Bitcoin, but UASF is beyond ridiculous. 
It is immature and iressponsible.
A pow change is as well, a fine idea in theory, but in the end changes absolutely nothing except for making bitcoin less secure.
Also talking about blacklists, isn't this sub extremely censored, how shameless it is to talk of blacklists here?

How is this ignorance? The author offered 0 constructive arguments, the whole article consisted of "Evil corporations are coming for your Bitcoin!".
@_date: 2017-07-12 07:23:50
Why segwit then? 
Why not just 2mb blocks?
Hardware and internet have advanced and it shouldn't be a problem, while segwit gives us 4mb for a small increase in transaction count.
Can someone care to elaborate?

Ok this is the first good comment in your chain.
Definitely agree we should be finding ways to stop it, but i disagree the developers should be stopping it. 
The developers should only propose solutions and let the community vote by running the software they want.
Right now, what i see is developers bullying, censoring, astroturfing and in the case of luke, acting like children.
Also, we don't all need to run full nonmining nodes, spv's on bitcoin are fine because of the open ledger, 95% of the users won't run full nodes in the future anyway.
We can block asicboost, sure, but the only thing really stopping mining centralization will be more asic manufacturers.

Roger has perfect right to do that even though it is douchey. 
People supporting bcc claim bcc is bitcoin, and for them it is. 
Bitcoin isn't defined by Core, it is defined by principles.

@_date: 2017-07-17 12:19:33
Fees aren't worth shit if bitcoin isn't worth shit, and neither are block rewards.
This is the beauty of bitcoin, it is in miners interest to keep bitcoin improving and going forward.
@_date: 2017-06-01 13:32:17
So is the 2mb argument. 
But we all know where it leads. 
Same applies to taking money from AXA
@_date: 2017-06-28 14:32:48
That would be the naive and idealistic way of looking at it, we just don't know if bitcoin was created for some nefarious reason we won't see until 50-100 years in the future
@_date: 2017-06-18 21:30:21
It is also a currency
@_date: 2017-06-10 12:00:31
Yes. 
Because it doesn't follow the whitepaper at all.
Pow? Fuck that, we're going to trust some randos who have nothing to lose.
@_date: 2017-06-27 21:07:55
And if they used Monero which at first sounds most logical, then exchanges would be forced not to exchange Monero, but you can't do that to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-29 13:35:00

Start reading, learn about bitcoin.
Never invest in what you don't understand.

@_date: 2017-06-16 12:31:22
Problem is, people still need to be able to run both mining and non mining nodes at home, we can only go as fast as tech advancement or only the big guys will be able to run nodes.

"Apart from funding"
Are you this naive or just stupid?
Do you not know how the world works?
Disclaimer : i am not on the miners side of the debate, they too are trying to fuck bitcoin to submission
@_date: 2017-06-17 16:45:52
The banks realise that progress cannot be stopped, so they decided to be part of the future. 
Can't blame them really, but this is good as it means they lose a lot of power.
@_date: 2017-06-27 21:06:50
How are they going to extract those bitcoins though? 
@_date: 2017-06-10 19:54:57

@_date: 2017-06-18 21:26:34
I would guess it's "potcoin lmao" kind of childish behaviour which is really huge in "stoner" circles.
@_date: 2017-06-05 09:31:26
It should, yeah, as long as hard drives where the ledger is aren't burned.

For how long will it be "working" before people abandon it because fees are insane?

Bitcoin is NOT fine the way it is.

Bitcoin cannot and should not be equivalent to gold, without real use it is fairy dust.

Segwit will only marginally help, a blocksize increase is mandatory.
Imo segwit+2mb is a pretty fair solution
