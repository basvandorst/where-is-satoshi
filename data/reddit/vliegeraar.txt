You know why we're going to visit the $8k range right? So we can see the Vegeta meme's again.

You don't have as much btc as you would have if you just holded onto your $100 worth of btc if you didn't trade. But I don't need to tell you it's harder holding through a bull market than it's holding through a bearmarket don't I.
@_date: 2019-07-03 01:08:03
Everybody want's to be in bitcoin since 2011, nobody can hold in a bull market..
@_date: 2019-07-03 01:55:26
If you would have put just $1,000 in btc in 2012 you would at least have 100 btc right now. I don't believe someone who gets panic sell attacks in a bullrun could keep that 100 btc from 2012 to 2019 without selling.
@_date: 2019-07-03 02:12:18
If you'd put even just put $100 at the top price of 2012 and never traded. I bet you would have had way more BTC right now than you have with your ''seling the top'' tactics.

In the ideal world there are no exchanges aswell, so only miners/network fees.

You held onto your btc which you bought with pennies till now?
@_date: 2019-06-19 16:06:29
So there won't be a price low enough to make you sell. You won't sell ever if it's lets say sub $1,000. For the things you need, you'll pay with dollars. (Bear market scenario)
But if the price is at $100,000 you will pay for things with your btc if by first converting to USD or directly. (Bull market scenario) 
So the question was. Is it harder to resist not selling your BTC when price has appreciated (bull) vs or is it harder to sell when prices are declining (bear).
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:04:47
Which percent of people who bought around $1 held to $20k? Maybe 1%.
@_date: 2019-06-19 15:59:34
You'll be unable to resist selling at $100,000 (bull market). But you'll resist easy not selling when price goes to $100 (bear market). 
This the thought I'm exactly trying to point out. So its harder to hold in a bull market. Right?
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:44:18
$100mm or $1billion, whats the difference right�� 
Calculation error.

Believe me, the new bitcoin billionairs will gladly sell you a couple satoshi's in the future worth more money than you can imagine right now. Bitcoin is infinitely divisible.
@_date: 2019-06-19 11:54:47
What can you do with money? Make more money.
How is it more easy to hold in a bull market. I believe a lot of long time holders will cash out in the next 20k + area.
@_date: 2019-06-19 11:12:12
More easy to hold through bear market. Right? The hard part is comming guys, get ready.
@_date: 2019-06-19 17:44:56
Very clear answer. Thank you. I agree it's harder to keep holding in a bull market. Imagine how many people already sold and with each price increase are selling. People who managed not to sell and walk away deserve all the gains they made since the inception of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-19 11:11:05
I think many long term holders have this idea now. To dump a little bit on the next run. So it's harder to hold through a bull market without selling.
@_date: 2019-06-19 11:58:40
Will long time holders still hold after 30k? I doubt it. 40k? Almost no one who bought in 2016. At 50k? Literally everybody and his mother will sell. So that's what I mean with it being difficult to hold while it goes up so much.
@_date: 2019-10-22 15:54:23
She's right.
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:17:19
With the comming of the next bull market. You think it will be easy to keep holding? Or is it going to tempt you to sell?
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:07:00
Yes indeed. 100× without selling is I think almost impossible. Imagine going 20k× without selling. Nah, no one can.
@_date: 2019-12-17 19:41:34
Where are the people that made 'Hodl' a meme when it was least good time to hold now?
@_date: 2019-06-19 16:09:54
Think this will happen to alot more people when we enter the full blown bull market. Than people selling the bottom on a bear market. So what I'm trying to figure out is, it's harder to hold in a bull market. Right?
@_date: 2019-06-19 13:14:47
If someone managed to buy $1k worth of bitcoin in 2011. He has around 1k BTC right now if he's still holding. If BTC price goes to $100k he has $1billion. I don't think anyone will manage to hold like this. I actually don't even believe there are people who bought around $1 and still are holding onto it.
@_date: 2019-12-17 20:54:53
That was one time and there was one time at the start of 2018.

No one buys crypto with the intent of losing money. Everybody who tells you different is not telling the truth. We can try to sooth the pain with words like "I'm innit f0r the tech", but we all know this is not what's it about. All you can do is wait for the greater fool and hope.
@_date: 2018-11-28 00:40:21
You think the breakdown from $6k weren't long time holders selling? Wait till you see $3k break down. You can hold on to your BTC bought at @ $10k
@_date: 2018-11-28 02:52:27
Sorry you didn't sell in december.
@_date: 2018-11-27 14:41:36
People who would 'never sell' sold allready and are waiting to enter the market again. Or they're still holding but when it's obvious the downtrend isn't going to change, will sell eventually.
