But for business expenses, buying with BTC makes it uncertain with regards to the tax deduction. I buy a printer for my home office. With Amazon and credit card, it is easily tax deductible. With BTC, even if I deduct it out of my other BTC income, it can be hard to defend in an audit unless the earned BTC and spent BTC were at the exact same price.

I'm trying to reason this out. First of all, are BTC addresses and BCH addresses indentical in format?
So can one look at an address and know for sure if it's BTC vs BCH? Along those lines, what happens if someone wants you to send them BCH to a certain address and you mistakenly send BTC to that address instead?

This was right on the money. And the principles you voice apply to so many conflicts in the US. Got a business dispute? Call the cops. Call a lawyer. No. That's not the solution. Instead, talk to the other party. Or vote with your feet by boycotting of just taking your business elsewhere. Neither cops nor lawyers end up solving the problem as well as having a civil discussion with the other party. (Of course if the other party is coming at your with a knife, then you have the right to defend yourself.)

Isn't it just as possible that other people who already hold BTC, will take a profit when it nears $9.5? So if this guy is buying from them at $9.4 and others keep selling then the price still will come down, but now this guy will be holding a lot of BTC that he purchased at the overinflated price. Sounds like a good way to potentially lose money also.

Either enough people want the poor taken care of or not enough people want the poor taken care of. If the former, then charity will more than take care of everyone, especially in light of the greater overall prosperity that is achievable with a free market. If the latter, then the worst thing you can do is take money from the few who are going to help the poor and put it into the control of politicians and bureaucrats. I don't hear many arguments against the fact that overall prosperity will be greater in a free market. Not even any North Koreans are trying to claim that. The claim has always been that even though the people will be richer as a whole, that it will be unequally distributed. There is a big difference between UNEQUALLY distributed and UNFAIRLY distributed. And again, would you rather be in the top 10th percentile of wealth in a North Korean village or in the bottom 10th percentile of wealth in Los Angeles?

Because, if the price of BTC drops a week later, they sell you your order at the old higher price. If they price of BTC goes up, then your order, which you were happy about, suddenly becomes high risk and is cancelled.

DEFLATIONARY CURRENCY: Common sense / thought experiment dictates that deflationary currencies are self-correcting. People only care about currency insofar as to what it can get them. If people hold currency that keeps increasing in value with respect to everything else, at some point, each person is going to make a decision to part with that currency in order go buy something to enjoy.
The argument is that somebody who got into BTC at $100 is going to hoard it even at $200, $300 and $1000 because he believes the value will keep rising, thereby stagnating the exchange process and clogging up economic progress. This is easily seen not to be a problem, because at some point, he is going to start spending some of it. Think what YOU would do?

It's an uphill climb trying to discuss ideas with those who have been indoctrinated since childhood. Much of the indoctrination consists of repeated messages "The State is Necessary". "The State is Benevolent". "The State can be Trusted".
If an impressionable child hears stuff over and over again, it is a very powerful way to shape opinion.
Here's [another way]( that has been tried.

Brainwashing as a gullible small child in the government schools warps minds into thinking that roads and security services and medical services and fire services are not possible without having an elite ruling class which can forcibly steal money from the workers. The real testament to the effectiveness of the indoctrination is the passion with which the enslaved argue to defend their slavemasters.

No no. It's worse than that. You're screwed either way.
I bought on Coinbase weeks ago when BTC was skyrocketing. So I would buy at say $50/BTC but by the time the transaction cleared they recalculated my BTC payout to be $80/BTC. So basically, you're screwed if the price goes up. You're screwed if the price goes down. They always give you the worse option.

This is a great idea. It works better when you demonstrate that you are the type of patront that the business wants. So in any scenario where you expect that they are salivating for you and your kind to come back, always ask "Do you accept BTC?"
Scenario: You bring a party of 10 to dinner, are well-behaved, ring up a large tab and tip generously.
Scenario: You go to a florist shop, place a big order, and let them know that since you are a wedding planner, you are looking for a place to regularly place large orders at.
What you don't want to do is eat a $10 meal, complain and send your food back 4 times, leave a mess and small tip and then say "By the way, do you accept BTC?"
In the new BTC society, reputation becomes more important (and powerful) than it used to be.

With BTC, you can 100% verify that what you get is genuine. With cash, you can look at it and swipe it with the special marker. Both ways are pretty good, but BTC is still more safely verified.
As for the new COINBASE feature, this is a good thing. The more options the better. There are some advantages of doing it that way. There are some advantages of meeting face to face.

People have zero ability to vote on what happens to them (perhaps with the exception of PROPS). Instead, they are given the false power of voting on one of two human beings, that's it. And often neither of those two human beings has the best interests of the voter at heart. So a system where a few ruling elite have enormous power over the lives of the common people is inherently corrupt. It's even sneakier when they give people the false illusion that they have some say.
@_date: 2013-03-24 15:00:07
A big advantage is that BTC doesn't have any greedy commissioned financial "advisers" trying to get your money and churn your account. Of course it might just be a matter of time before Merill Lynch and Morgan Stanley or Mt Gox itself hire salespeople to offer to manage your BTC account and tell you when to buy and when to sell.

Thanks, everybody. This really helps when explaining BTC to newbies when they reply, "what if somebody guesses my key and steals all my money?"
I have another question:
Is there a difference between guessing someone's private key completely from scratch vs trying to guess someone's private key if armed with knowing what the public key is?
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:40:48
Thanks for alerting the public, but this is not entirely true. In fact it's even worse than that. I bought on Coinbase weeks ago when BTC was skyrocketing. So I would buy at say $50/BTC but by the time the transaction cleared they recalculated my BTC payout to be $80/BTC. So basically, you're screwed if the price goes up. You're screwed if the price goes down. They always give you the worse option.
@_date: 2013-04-28 08:24:41
The answer to your question depends on whether you are asking on what grounds MORALLY can "they" do something vs by which means LOGISTICALLY can "they" do something.
Morally, there are already countless things "they" do that are wrong. The Constitution was set up to designate what "they" could and couldn't do, but since "they" jockeyed themselves into a position where "they" get to interpret the Constitution, it's effectively lost the power to be the checks-and-balances that it was intended to do.
Bottom line: "They" can do anything they want as long as working people are willing to let them get away with.

Very loose translation?: If you put 95% of everything you have into BTC, in 20 years,  you'll be a tycoon or you'll be flat broke. If you stay away from BTC and just continue your safe, stable 9-5 desk job existence, then that's where you will be. Neither tycoon nor flat broke.

Take ten people, starting from scratch and have them race to acquire BTC using various methods (MtGox. Coinbase. BitInstant. LocalBitcoin). I predict the localbitcoin guy will be either  fastest or one of the top 3 as long as he lives in a major metro area.
As for sketchiness, I don't think so, but it depends on how you define it. If sketchiness = private and confidential and if non-sketchiness = fully verified giving all your personal info, then OK.

Another question. How does one use bitaddress.org to BIP38-encrypt a specific private key. From playing around with it, it looks like you can only BIP38-encrypt an address that it randomly generated at that very moment, but not a previously generated private key nor a hand-seeded one.

This is probably the easiest way for someone to get in on some mining without having to set things up on their own. Just buy a share with about 1 BTC. However, unless dividends skyrocket, my guess is that you will be earning just .007 to .008 BTC per week, so in about 2 1/2 years, you will have recouped what you paid for the share and still own the share to sell back if you choose.
This is assuming dividends don't go up or down much and that's certainly not a predictably valid assumption.

You can always do it in pieces. Meet. Transact $20 as a test. Then do $40 more. Meanwhile, you are chatting with a human being and using your common sense and intuition to decide whether or not he/she is a danger. Believe it or not, the majority of people in the world are not dangerous. Nothing in the world is completely risk-free. You could get mugged at a bank ATM. You could get harmed from online dating. You could get ripped-off by a company like Coinbase. Search previous posts to see the Coinbase horror stories around April of this year.
In any case, there are advantages and disadvantages to the different ways of acquiring BTC. Choose the one that best serves your needs. Peace out.

It's the oddest things. After I sell, about 60% of the time, the prices goes up and about 40% of the time, the price goes down. This is also about the distribution every time after I buy. It's the darndest thing. It's almost as if it were random but with an upward trend.
