I think you're also missing the importance of inter-operable solutions.
TenX, for example, enables you to spend your Bitcoin anywhere Visa is accepted already. Yes, I know this doesn't accomplish the vision of decentralization, but it does ALREADY solve: 1. scale and 2. availability issues.
This will make Bitcoin usable long before LN is implemented.
PS I don't think anyone should buy the TenX coin, PAY. As far as I can tell, it no longer has any value, since the company changed their policy on distributions to PAY holders (i.e., there will be no distributions).

Maybe we're talking past each other, but thanks for clarifying.
What I meant was that TenX looks to have an interesting project, so it would be worth using. Buying PAY coins to use it makes sense, then. But buying the coins as an "investment" doesn't. They're also quite cagey about any possible value for the coin in recent discussions.

There are a lot of claims in that statement, and they are not immediately clear. Could you clarify?
It would appear reasonable, prima facie, that if your mining pool controlled 51%, that would be ideal ... as it would get more blocks, hence higher pay outs.

I've used Genesis-Mining, not Hashflare, but they are similarly structured. My assessment, honestly, is: don't bother.
1. Cloudmining isn't a scam with a reputable company, but it doesn't make much money.
2. It often takes MUCH longer to pay off than advertised because your amount of hashing power declines rather precipitously (relative to the global hashing power amount).
3. You'd make more money just buying BTC (with dollar cost averaging). Take what you have, and divide into say four equal chunks. Then buy in once a week until you're done.

You can go read this stuff on seekingalpha.com.
Here's the equation for short (it's based on Ken Alabi's paper, btw).
V(N) = kN^2, where k = 4*10^-9
In English: the value of the network equals the nodes squared, times a scaling constant k. The constant is derived from regression analysis. Nodes used are unique daily users.
And before you get too happy, that analysis also suggests that Bitcoin is currently in a bubble, as BTC ought to be worth around $2200 (unless BTC ought to trade at a multiple of its Metcalfe value).

Yep, the official statement is that it will be in Q4 of 2017 -- but the specific date is not specified.

Yep. SeekingAlpha.com, though late to the game, has much better discussions of Bitcoin -- from a financial perspective -- right now.
What this sub does well: News Events. 
Breaking news items are posted here MUCH faster than elsewhere.

I too ran an analysis on this a while back, and found that searches spiked after a price surge -- it was retro-dictive rather than predictive.
Youtube searches were a little better though.

Well, increasing block size was never a workable long term solution. So I never thought of BCH as good tech...and this would be part of the mess.

I agree. The Chinese article (posted on their equivalent of bitcoin.com) says nothing about the exchanges staying open.
The claim is this: Bitcoin (and similar cryptos) will gain the legal status of virtual property on October 1st (that's the legislation).
This means they'll have basically the same status in China as they do in the USA presently. So you can now sue for damages and theft, etc. in China. That's good, but it's a different sort of good.
TL;DR It's a step forward, but not too big.

That's actually not what it literally says. I'm going to quote a quote here (forgive me for the meta-ing):


The point is that they will need to satisfy government regulations. So the fear that the Chinese market will disappear is unfounded. This is what the road to mass adoption looks like.

You're right, as the SEC has prevented Bitcoin ETFs because a futures market does not yet exist. With this, Bitcoin ETFs will become viable and institutional money will begin pouring in (both by ETF and Hedge Funds).

If you assume a growth rate of 25% annually (for the nodes), and keep Metcalfe's law, you'll end up with 50k.
So the 25k does seem quite conservative to me.
