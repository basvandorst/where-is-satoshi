Usefullness is relative to a subjective end. Therefore their value does depend upon a subjective state of mind and is not intrinsic (although in some cases e.g. food, water, shelter this state of mind is broadly shared).

That's just not true. If they want to die for their ideals they don't need food. 
By your counting you could as well include Oxygen (and sulfur for that matter) and anything that is "needed" to sustain life. That is not what we mean when we talk about values. Those are means to an subjective end that one my have or one may have not.

You are good with words =)

How has food intrinsic value for someone who is on a hunger strike?

So it's not intrinsic? Intrinsic means it is connected to the substance in question. Since the material properties of oil and gas have not changed...

Stating that intrinsic value is inherent usefulness is just a circularity in disguise. The same arguments one can make against "intrinsic value" apply to "inherent usefulness". You can not conceptually grasp what it means to be useful if there is no one who wants to use it. 
The example of natural resources illustrates that quite well. Uran ore was not useful before people started the atomic age. The same goes for bronze and iron.
I garnt you that paper money or digital money does not have practical applications besides the ones we associate with money but that does not change the fact that even for those goods that have a wider field of applications their value is only derived from mental states that are external of themselves and therefore not intrinsic.
The labour theory of value is unfortunately wrong. I could elaborate on that but I'm sure you are aware of the many counter examples.
I think what you mean with intrinsic value is the following: "A good has intrinsic value if it is true that the good is values by almost all mankind." The problem is that this statement does not tell us something about the value-properties of the goods in question but oft the way people tend to act  -- which can change.

If a concept cannot stand the test of pedantry we should try to do better.
