I would think the police would have been called. I mean, if I paid for something, no business can force you not to leave until the payment clears. 
You wouldn't be not allowed to leave a grocery store until they could cash your check because it *could* bounce or *could* be am illegitimate check. Same concept

feelssogood96 here.  hit me up on my bitcoin selling thread and we exchanged our information.  Long story short we ended up trading $100 for $100 worth of BTC, and we talked about making future larger transactions.  I talked to the guy over the phone and we communicated through text and email.  During an email conversation I get an email from the same email we had been corresponding through claiming the email was hacked and stolen.  I call and talk to on the phone (he sends me his number through the "hacked" email) and try to see what is happening.  
After speaking to both ackza and zackza on the phone, I am still confused and very skeptical.  As of now I do not know who is telling the truth, or and I honestly don't care, but regardless, I stopped offering to do business with through venmo unless we could use a more secure payment processor with buyer protection such as paypal.  Venmo offers no protection to me, the bitcoin buyer, and IF this is a scam or a case of fraud venmo doesn't offer the victim any protection either.  
At this moment, in order to protect myself, and anyone else who may be involved, I am not doing business with either of these users.

I heard both of their voices, they are definitely different people.  
Now, I will not say that there is a chance they may be working together, but I don't believe that is the case.  Regardless, I am going to stay out of this now.

I just got off the phone with and after talking to him for over half an hour, it is my opinion that ackza (Lets call him "Zack") is the victim of a scammer and an identity thief.  The user lets call him "Scammer" for the sake of this report, allegedly has hacked into Zack's Reddit account, email account, bank accounts, and also has photos of Zack in public as well as photos of his identity.  
I have talked to both Zack and Scammer, and I previously posted ( the results of our conversations.  However, after doing more research and talking with Zack, I have checked the venmo accounts I have been receiving money from and noticed that I have been receiving money from different accounts under different names (the screen name was different, however, so that I wouldn't notice this).  Also, Scammer refused to conduct business through paypal despite a much stronger buyer and seller protection policy. 
I talked farther with Zack over the phone, and I told him that "scammer" told me an almost identical story to what Zack told me previously.  Zack now believes that the scammer may be listening to his phone calls, which, in my opinion, sounds reasonable considering how identical the two men's stories were to each other.  
Zack alerts me that scammer is on the FBI's wanted list and the police are conducting searches for the scammer.  DO NOT TRUST ("scammer") and any of his aliases.
I have stopped business with scammer (obviously), and I am still in correspondence with Zack.  I will provide him with an IP trace of the emails I have sent and received.  I may be out $100 if it turns out that the business I have conducted thus far with "scammer" is actually fraudulent.  I am a 19 year old, broke-ass college student who may have just lost 30% of his savings.
Be careful Reddit, there is a very bad person out there.
EDIT:  I just got off the phone again with and his reddit account has been compromised and his password has been changed.  His previous post about what has been happening is deleted and some of his previous comments have been deleted.  He has notified the FBI and the police and they are taking care of the situation.  As of this point, I am going to stop working with Bitcoin for a little while, hope this blows over, and let the authorities reach resolution.

I might take you up on this.  Was hoping for a .com site, but I might just settle for one of these.

I thought of this, but it sounds too like crypt - as in the burrial place - agora.  I don't want people thinking i'm selling underground vaults.
