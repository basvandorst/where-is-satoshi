I think she said something about a trading website. i hung up pretty fast when i heard her indian accent. But it was very random. Right after i answered you that they stopped calling me, they called me. I'm suspecting that they have access to my accounts with my email and they ofv still have my phonenumber. I'm not sure if i should take this to the police or not.

I signed up, and moments later this guy with an Indian accent calls me up to verify my account. I asked him to delete my account since there is no place you can do that on there site. I may have used some heavy words and told them that I believed they were scamming people, and he tried to roste me. After he hung up on me they called me up again but didn't say anything, and when I told them to delete my account again, the same number calls me up. So I'm now sitting here trying to figure out a way to delete my user. I happy I didn't verify my account or give them anything else then my email and phone number(it more than I would like them to have, but at least they didn't get my debit card info)
