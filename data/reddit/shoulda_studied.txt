Sounds like your being manipulated lol.

People who bought into this company deserve to be scammed. It says right on the website it will take 2 months or more to deliver. What incentive do they have to ship orders when they could just keep them on site and mine themselves until it isn't profitable?

I'll take "Things that never happened" for 500$.

This thread perfectly shows how much of an ignorant circle jerk 99% of bitcoin "investing" is.

Since when do you purchase anything with gold? Gold is a commodity. It has value because it's pretty and is inert so it literally does last forever.

How can bitcoin go on forever? If the idea of bitcoin - it being accepted everywhere for purchasing goods online or abroad - fails, than demand for bitcoin falls. And its value eventually falls to zero. Does it not?

But you'd agree that the majority of bitcoins current value is speculative. People are mostly just sitting on their bitcoins, not using them to conduct transactions.

There is financial input to obtain bitcoins.. Doing a service for someone to for bitcoins is the same thing as them paying you cash and you purchasing bitcoins yourself with that money.
How's bitcoins different from "cutco knives" that sales people pay out of pocket to stock up on because someone told them "trust us, they'll sell like hotcakes!". Isn't this perceived demand for bitcoins the same as a group pushing people to sell their crappy product?

May I ask what are you going to use it for?

I hope people realize that mounting chips on FPGAs isn't a trivial task. Not to mention 100's of them. I have a hard time imagining this is cost effective even if you can get them all mining bitcoins.

If new businesses that people want to use don't start offering bitcoin transactions then won't the bitcoin scheme collapse?
The bitcoin market can't survive purely on more and more people deciding to speculate on it.
@_date: 2013-06-04 04:43:45
Hope people realize this before purchasing them. The whole idea of selling chips directly to consumers is idiotic for this reason.

I meant to say onto some kind of PCB. And no it isn't trivial. You need to get a board designed (even if they give you spec's you still need to get it made) and than mounted either by yourself or have someone do it. I doubt most people here can mount a silicon chip with 30+ pins onto a printed circuit board. But hey just my 2 cents.
