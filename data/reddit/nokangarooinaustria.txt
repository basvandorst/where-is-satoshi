Well I think the programmer of the bot is the one who would get prosecuted - since the bot can't be at fault.  
It basically is like letting your dog run free - if the dog bites someone it is still your fault - even though you didn't do anything - or more precisely - because you didn't do anything (like supervising the dog and keeping it on a leash)  
  
So in this scenario - the programmer would need to build in failsafes like personally supervising the transactions to make sure the bot doesn't do anything illegal.  
  
Also - I didn't read the article - just the reddit headline :| 
After reading the article - sounds reasonable - it is an art project - and they don't have the intent of consuming or selling the items - so it isn't actually illegal.

In Austria we have credit cards but we don't use them as much as i.e. the USA  
I for one dislike to give my credit card info to anyone - there are no good security guards to reduce fraud.
Frankly I have no Idea why credit cards still function - I guess the reason is that humans are morally good.

Than it gets interesting - it would be most likely the people that pay for it - even if a million people pay together.  
Or the person(s) that wrote the part of the code that sent the bot to a darknetmarket - they had to know that it would (potentially) buy illegal things.  
  
It is a very interesting thought experiment - I guess that if such a case ever got to a court it would take a very long time until the judge and lawyers understood what is happening and who is to blame. 
Suddenly I would like to start such a thing - the only problem would be that if there is a single person who knowingly started such a thing the blame would most likely be his or hers.

I guess so too.  
So only one fixed exchange rate until someone comes and changes the SD Card. 
On the plus side - this way you don't need a display - a sticker with the exchange rate written on will suffice ;)

Credit cards are proof that humans are innately good.

I am just gonna cite u/fresheneesz because he/she wrote it better than I could:
It's most definitely allowed, but managing it can be a hassle for the customer and the business alike, so most businesses just see it as easier to charge credit card prices even for cash purchases. This in essence means people paying in cash are being forced to subsidize the prices that credit card buyers pay.

With credit cards you routinely hand everything somebody needs to pay with your money to somebody. Of course there is some fraud and you are paying a fee so the credit card company can do it's thing to return your money back to you.  
The costs for the credit card company is about 3% of the gross value of payments done - lost in fraud.  
They can recuperate some of that and you or whoever lets you buy stuff with credit cards pays a fee so they still make money and stay in business.
  
If people would be "evil" there would be more fraud making the fees (or loss to the credit card company) higher - which would lead to credit cards not being a thing anymore.

I gave that answer to somebody else about the same time:










just thought that people would have seen that - but the way reddit is formatted it likely escaped you that this comment was from me too (if you even read it).

The thing is - it is hard to get something out of stolen credit card information - but it would be easy just to hurt the person that owns the credit card.  
If you order stuff to your home or buy a plane ticket with somebodies credit card you won't escape legal trouble. But just using the information to hurt the owner - that is easy - buy playboy subscriptions for random people or something.  
We usually don't do this kind of thing - that is what I meant with being good.  
  
Most crime is committed out of rage, hatred or personal need that seems to/ can't be sated in any other way.  
  
We are social animals and most of us just can't get out of our skin and commit crimes just because.

Spain and Italy has a similar law

Nope.  
Generally people are good and nice to each other. This does not exclude that there is a subset of people that are not.

Thanks for your wisdom - I don't know where it comes from but the first sentence is a bit off the mark.  
I am from Europe and credit cards are a bit less of a thing here. We use direct debit cards for the same thing you use credit cards. We also use a PIN for each transaction (sometimes only over a certain amount like 20€ but always if the amounts add up to something over 100€).  
The idea of just signing for a transaction (and knowing that no one even looks at the signature) is a bit bewildering to me.  
I am opposed to credit cards because I don't see the need to pay for owing money if I have the money in my account. I understand taking a credit for something big like buying property and building a house - and using said property as collateral, but I oppose being in debt for everyday transactions.  
  
Credit cards are a con game - the bank gives you money upfront in the hope that you spend more than you can afford to pay back in time - and they hope that you will be able to pay the high fees attached to owing them.   
If you always pay back in time you win - but then you are someone who didn't need credit anyway. (you still pay fees so you don't really win compared to debit cards - and loose compared to paying cash)  
If you are unable to balance your account in time you pay interest for owing money - a bad thing considering that you didn't have enough money to balance your account even before paying interest.  
  
Credit cards are a tool to get money out of people that suck with money.

I kind of got addicted to aliexpress.com - free delivery for a 20cent whistle... it would be interesting how they make a profit of that one...

funny thing about prime - at least in Austria their normal service got markedly slower before they introduced prime.  
Normally I had my package 2 days after ordering it - sometimes even on the next day. Since prime is a thing packages tend to take 3-5 days now...

Just implement 50% upfront and 50% after the shipment hast arrived.  
Add a system where buyers and sellers have a public rating and allow them to change the amount that has to be payed upfront according to the rating.  
Example: new buyer, old and well rated seller - seller sets the upfront rate to 80%. 
If the buyer has a similar rating as the seller the rate is 50:50
if the seller has a poor rating the rate is 20:80
You can even implement this with a 5 star rating ;)
@_date: 2015-09-25 10:57:39
Jup factoring the total value into this would be a good idea - or just show the total amount the seller has traded in (in categories like &lt;100$ or between 100$ and 1000$)

nope - I'm from Austria and we had the "Schilling" a Dollar was worth about 10-20 Schillinge (depending on the specific time of my life)   
I miss the old nomination sometimes for the simple reason, that I didn't need to think about everything after the ".".  
There was a 20 Schilling note so everything in coins was just small stuff that didn't really add up - and it was a more intuitive system than the Euro is now (at least for me)  
I'm using the Euro for more than 10 years now and I don't even know most prices in Schilling anymore but being able to think and talk about money in the 1 to 1000 magnitude with 1 being a single chewing gum and 1000 being enough to gas up your car 3 or 4 times (cheaper times...) was just very convenient.
