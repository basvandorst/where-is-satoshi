I mean, the average American university has an annual ruination of ~ $30,000 and a R&amp;B of $20,000 (and I'm trying to be really generous with these numbers for you). At an average of 10 classes annually, that's still only going to be $5,000/class with room and board. I'm not saying college isn't ridiculously expensive, just trying to put some perspective on the numbers we're throwing around.

That's pretty fair man - I've been procrastinating studying for a law school final pretty hard, so I probably took this a little too seriously hahaha.

I get that we're being hyperbolic to make a point, and college is way too expensive, but no one actually thinks it costs $17k per class... right...?

Man he was trying to say it was $60,000, I was throwing out big unobjectionable numbers that still proved him wrong. If you look further down, I ended up giving the actual 2017 CoI for in-state public, out-of-state public, and private.  (Which are ~ $10k, $25k, and $35k respectively). Those numbers come straight from the College Board, they're real.

$62,000 is annual tuition at Duke, $64,000 at Harvard. You can certainly pay that much if you're at a top ten school, but that doesn't make it average. To quote USA Today, "According to the College Board, the average cost of tuition and fees for the 2017–2018 school year was $34,740 at private colleges, $9,970 for state residents at public colleges, and $25,620 for out-of-state residents attending public universities."
I'm sorry, I'm really not trying to be difficult, I'm just pretty well versed in this topic, and $60k is unreasonable by any standard as an average.
