Please recreate each pocket you had after restoring seed. Then, you need to create new addresses for each pocket until it adds all of your funds to view.

To summarize:
Brock Pierce and a group of pedophiles were busted in 2002 and cut a deal with FBI to be informants; on whatever projects the FBI required them for.
They have now been called into action by the FBI as the face of the Mt Gox takeover.  Which is actually the FBI attempting to gain access to past and future Gox records under the guise of a private section acquisition.

You can only mine SHA256 coins. Mining is useless

It quotes me a current price, said nothing about being charged Friday price today.
Just tested, got .1 BTC xferred out of Coinbase 
@_date: 2013-11-15 03:46:49

@_date: 2013-11-12 01:56:45
Coinbase is US only :(
@_date: 2013-11-15 03:47:29
Not feeling it
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:41:38
@_date: 2013-11-12 01:56:01
Piss off 
hope you used a throwaway or your karma is toast
@_date: 2013-11-10 16:32:38
We knew they did this already
@_date: 2013-11-15 04:03:08
Tumble those coins!
@_date: 2013-11-15 20:17:11
Maybe this new Coinbase you speak if offers better quality service?

Generally markets aren't going anywhere , but I think the best vendors will work direct with consumers or make their own .onions after numerous escrow losses 
@_date: 2013-11-11 16:49:40
@_date: 2013-11-09 04:56:36
Looks like about 1 million USD. How much was stolen from inputs.io?
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:11:21
I don't think we're getting the price e we were quoted. We'll see
@_date: 2013-10-28 01:10:20
wrong. value has zero correlation to difficulty. zip, zilch, nada
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:34:31
No BTC no care
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:13:30
Coinbase keeps your BTC in its own address until you send** it from their app
(Screw up via swipe kboard)
@_date: 2013-11-15 04:00:39
There's a club for that
 It's called everyone.
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:14:02
Bet they won't use it
@_date: 2013-11-08 04:37:07

8 billion and rising, douchebag
@_date: 2013-11-15 21:20:27
nope. I can attest to this, brand new...sold coins, got money deposited in two days. Couldn't buy a coin from them to save my life at that time, either.
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:00:03
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:58:28
Standard for every tx I've done with them. I think it's due to the way they manage their wallet security. I don't keep my coins stored with Coinbase for this reason.
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:56:35
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:24:58
Great question. I was thinking load distribution but if I'm not using chrome with auto translate, is a pain in the ass
@_date: 2013-11-12 01:57:09
Legal ramifications??
@_date: 2013-11-10 18:14:53
Watch out for slippage
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:23:27
One time there was a retard named Mike Hearn who thought "what's the best way to fuck up bitcoin"
Then coins slowly lost fungability.

You sir are an asshole
@_date: 2013-11-12 00:00:58
Well, believe it or not selling miners violates their tos as well. So which was it that got yours canceled?
I accept bitcoin on my listings without issue.
@_date: 2013-11-15 20:12:02
Im well aware he was cherry picked by Satoshi. This was clearly one of his few mistakes.
@_date: 2013-11-15 04:14:55
And it got pulled. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 02:25:30
**Q:**"I'm not technically savvy, but wouldn't the solution be CryptoLocker counter-measures on client computers?"
**A:**(Mike Hearn)"That's certainly a solution yes, but unfortunately it's sort of like saying the solution to burglary is having locks ondoors and windows, so we don't need the police." 
@_date: 2013-11-15 04:19:58
$5 billion dollars small.
@_date: 2013-11-10 16:13:36
Thanks for the tip =)

@_date: 2013-11-18 04:11:23
Screw the "foundation"
@_date: 2013-10-28 01:59:45
yes, and the same amount of bitcoins will exist regardless.
@_date: 2013-12-27 02:14:29
The best way to arbitrage is sell on local bitcoins and charge Gox price...
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:07:14
Now to do the same with referral bonuses. not as many are buying 1 full BTC at these prices.
@_date: 2013-11-10 19:24:33
You'd have to transfer them to an address that only you control before the thief
@_date: 2013-11-15 20:19:12
Per day. At least that's what my btcguild says
