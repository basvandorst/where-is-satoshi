If you have confirmed the device and it still says pending it likely did not recieve the activation push. You can hit the refresh button in the top right of the app to complete the pairing on the device. FYI Push Notifications are needed for the best experience.

It is closer to 5-6 cents depending on the exchange. Interesting stat: MT Gox started trading Bitcoin at 5 cents.

Our systems remain stable and we utilze outside SMTP vendors for our e-mail delivery so I am sorry that was slow. Can you please let me know which platform and device you are using? As I said before Push notification needs to be enabled for the best experience, but the refresh button on the pair screen and pull to refresh in the main screen after pairing force a pull request if you are not getting them.

Sorry you are having an issue, were you able to install LaunchKey and get your device paired?

Thanks for the question. Authy is a single possestion factor (OTP) similar to Google Authenticator that is typically implemented with existing password (knowledge) systems. LaunchKey can work in this manner, but LaunchKey can also replace traditional password systems with multi-factor authentication in one package. We offer knowledge (pin, combo), possession (device) and inherence (geo-location) factors. Our mission is to remove passwords from the authentication ecosystem.

The App itself is also free and we use LaunchKey authentication to validate the faucet submissions.
