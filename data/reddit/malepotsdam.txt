Partner? Don’t flatter yourself. And excuse my crudeness, but they could give less of a shit about you. Their platform has and is falling apart. Many people have been complaining for months the lack of support their site has, even worse than Coinbase. 
Keep attempting to contact them by all means. I hope you get your money back as soon as possible, but never expect a centralized entity to be loyal to you. Their is no such thing when dealing with finances. Be loyal to yourself.

You will get back the same amount of BTC. That amount of BTC has risen in value, so it will be worth more than 50. 
For example,
I have 0.01 bitcoins. I bought in when that amount was $100.00.
Now I want to sell 0.01 bitcoin, and it will be worth more than $100.00. The amount- 0.01 doesn’t rise, just the numerical market value when attempting to sell.

@_date: 2017-12-13 12:15:07
Did they send you an email about the freeze?
Usually they’ll leave you a link in that email giving you the option to unfreeze the account if you paste it onto the browser you logged in from.  You can simply copy and paste the link onto the browser you logged in from. Paste it directly on that *exact* same browser and it should reactivate.
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:04:35
Sounds fun. 
But- it’s not dollar cost averaging. 
Someone bashing Bitcoin could happen at random times. Dollar cost averaging is when you have a fixed amount and you intend to purchase on regular schedules.

No, it’s not safe there. 
Move it to GDAX.com.
From GDAX go to deposit option and deposit from coinbase. 
From there transfer your bitcoins for free to your private wallet. I suggest Electrum to start off.

I invite you to be open minded and look at the scenario from a different perspective.
It seems like those who take chances and manage themselves financially do better.
Everything is still speculative at this point and if cryptocurrency ends up offering more value than the traditional financial system then mass adoption and demand naturally follows.
Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency offers a global solution to banking and personal finance where the traditional seems to be lacking innovation in many areas. Keep in mind that no system is perfect and human nature is always a factor concerning how smoothly system A or B operates.
When you say "poor" I believe poor represents a person's overall mindset. I'm making a general statement but it's safe to say that the majority of people who have financial issues have a "poor" mindset when it comes to educating themselves with money management skills and also have a poor ability to recognize opportunity - think of "seeing the bigger picture" or having "vision".
How does what I say tie everything together?
While I agree that it sucks for some people, it doesn't really matter what asset or asset or industry it is - the pioneers and early adopters will always win every time. The pioneers are the people who have a vision, make the vision a reality, and make it easily accessible for everyone to follow. Often the pioneers are "rich in knowledge" or "rich" in other abilities MOST people aren't willing to learn.
You seem angry so if you don't want to support cryptocurrency then you don't have to. If you believe that the world is heading towards adoption of digital currency then please stay. The current value (including mining costs) of crypto reflects the speculative adoption. If the real life cost of living skyrockets (hyper inflates) and cryptocurrency makes sense to more people then it proves the other system is broken and that the winner is the solution.
Before forming an opinion you should look into the problems that the traditional system has. The USD has 90%+ it's original value, corporate greed etc. I'm not suggesting that this doesn't translate over to some degree. I'm sure that if you can think of the overall value proposition cryptocurrency has to offer to combat these problems it might change your perspective. 
"Rich" people generally take more chances, recognize solutions to problems, and thirsty for knowledge/resources to make it happen. This is usually rewarded fairly.
"Poor" people generally are closed minded, don't act on opportunity, don't look for problems to solve, and don't question their reality until a breaking point - usually a point where it's too late. 
Rich or poor, it's USUALLY your mindset and your own fault that you're like that. 
Crypto is a speculative global solution to financial problems and should be treated as such until more adoption comes along. Value reflects adoption and use case. You can avoid overpaying for a speculative asset with education. 
Have a great day.
~~ I hope I win~~

I don’t think it’s up to a random guy on Reddit to educate you my friend. The world is at your finger tips!
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:26:14
It’s normal. 
People have waited a few hours for certain transactions to go through. 
It never says “pending” on the Trezor wallet. The transaction will just appear and say “unconfirmed” until it is confirmed by miners. 
Give it time.

@_date: 2017-12-11 20:36:26
It has passed 17k. It has also passed 18k and it has also passed 19k up to 19,650 as far as I’ve seen it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:29:15
That won’t and shouldn’t be a problem. But due to the size of your transaction and the small fee you paid, expect to be waiting quite a bit of time. With over 200k unconfirmed transactions, I would be very patient. 
You can always try increasing your fee on the transaction using replace-by-fee, if the wallet you used to send the Bitcoins offers it. I would suggest doing a google search on how to do that. Electrum wallet offers it, if you use Electrum.
You can try
To accelerate the transaction. But I think they are also backed up- give it a try anyway. 
Other than that, be patient. Everyone is waiting hours to get confirmations.

Mine actually offers 5%.
It’s a prepaid card that also serves as a savings account if you set it up correctly.
Check out Insight

GDAX doesn’t let you link a credit card. You can only use it by depositing money from your bank to the exchange and that takes 5-10 business days to clear.

With that being said. I’m really hoping the lightning network will get us one step closer. With it, I hope Bitcoin can be used rather than stored. Much like a savings account, some coins are stored but the rest are used for items we want to purchase or bills we have to pay. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:07:07
What the actual fuck are you even saying my man? 
I never said it wasn’t an exchange. I’m saying that you can literally meet with people and exchange fiat for bitcoins. Something you seemed to have dismissed in your title. I understood you meant to say-that not everyone can literally do that, I just thought I would throw in localbitcoins.
com so as to show that trading in person IS possible. 
And I’ve mentioned as well. There are MULTIPLE ways to obtain bitcoins from MULTIPLE exchanges. The ones you see people bitching about are ones like Coinbase, who have ALWAYS been infamous for piss poor customer service, even before the massive amount of newcomers. They just could most honesty give less of shit for their customers.

Coinbase isn’t a wallet.

Usually when there’s a big dip, all exchanges are crashing but not necessarily the same amount. While GDAX could have crashed 1000 bucks Gemini could have only crashed 800 bucks. Every exchange is different but usually fall within the same patterns
Coindesk is a good source to find a more average price of Bitcoin which tends to be higher than GDAX.
GDAX is not the be all end all of market value

Until bitcoin is implemented and used as an everyday currency, I will most definitely think about it as a way to convert it back to fiat. The amount that I bought was because I believe in the technology but if my earnings will allow me to buy my mama a damn house, I’m buying my mama a damn house.

They are wanting to discuss Bitcoin. Is it not okay to discuss the pros and cons? Other coins DO affect Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:58:04
For example.
I’m selling a house, it’s worth 30 BTC. 
The buyer gives me a USB with 30 BTC but that buyer also knows the seed for the 30 BTC. 
He goes home and the 30 BTC are no longer mine. And sure I could, I don’t know, transfer the BTC to my wallet for it to be secure, but this defeats the whole purpose of the USB in the first place.

No. Coinbase deliberately rises the prices of Bitcoin. When you look at market value and attempt to go to their buy/sell place the buy price is always higher and the sell price is always lower. This is how they profit.

Yes.

Trading with Bitcoin is not advised, especially with the amount of inexperience you have.
You could lose everything when attempting to time the market. 
Ideally, you want to buy low, sell high, to gain maximum return. Unfortunately, many have tried doing this with the unpredictable nature of Bitcoin and have lost a lot of money-if not immediately, then over time. 
Holding onto your crypto seems to be the safest way to see a gradual increase, as you have with your initial $13 AUD. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:01:15

 Be prepared for higher fees.

Gemini takes around the same time to clear but they allow you to have credits. Let’s say you want to buy 100 bucks worth of Bitcoins. You can deposit the money into Gemini and they’ll give you a credit of 100 dollars to use right away for trading. You can’t withdraw until the money clears, but it’s different than what other exchanges offer.

Not to invalidate your post or search for discussion on this topic. But there are other seriously more impacting environmental issues affecting our planet right now that need to be addressed before many are worried about Bitcoin energy consumption. Especially environmentalists. 
The animal agriculture industry, the clothing industry, all are much higher and more serious issues our world is facing. 
The technology is changing frequently-maybe a change will happen that could make the energy consumptions much less intimidating for some, but I just don’t see a lot of people being turned away due to this right now. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:30:17
I mean you can mention it. 
Ledger wallets are JUST as reliable and safe as Trezor wallets are. They support more alt coins and Trezor is doing the same with the latest version they have for pre-order. 
Customers have actually voiced their opinion on Trezor as much as they have for Ledger. 
Both hardware wallet companies are open source. Why are you fear mongering?

Gemini my friend 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:38:26
Trezor does not appear to offer replace by fee. But- I found this comment.
“Depending on the transaction you can possibly use 'Child Pays for Parent'. This requires that one of the outputs from the first transaction is under your control (or someone else who agrees to participate). This is usually a change address.
If you pay a high enough fee on a second transaction which depends on the first transaction being in the block chain then miners will look at the two as a package and decide whether to mine them. This option will usually end up costing at least double the fee you would have otherwise paid”

I think it’s a service they provide and they can charge whatever they want. You as a consumer can decide to keep your business with them or not. 
I also encourage using a well-known, low fee exchange. GDAX and Gemini are good examples of exchanges that have decent to no fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:45:38
I on the other hand predict a drop
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:37:42
And we had a massive increase in just 2 days. Just last week we hit 10k and that took 8 years to reach. In 2 days we managed to almost hit 20k. This drop is healthy and expected. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:03:57
Yes. Go try it yourself. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:38:25
Yes, it doesn’t say unconfirmed because the transaction hasn’t gone through yet. Like I’ve mentioned, people wait a couple hours sometimes to actually see the transaction appear AT ALL in their wallets. Once it goes through, it will appear as unconfirmed. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:43:42
Yes, you can move your Bitcoin from Electrum to Ledger. Just go to the send tab on the Electrum wallet, and input the receiving address displayed to you by your ledger nano s on the chrome app. 
And you don’t necessarily have to be a complete moron to be hacked. Some viruses can be nearly untraceable on your computer.
Good luck!

@_date: 2017-12-03 12:23:44
Right, and my argument wasn’t that Bitcoin’s energy consumption isn’t something to worry about. It absolutely is. It’s something that needs to be focused on as much as decreases in fees are worried about. It is simply just not a problem that is turning away eco-friendly folk as much as OP wants to believe it is. 
People are not going to turn away from Bitcoin because of the energy it uses. It’s just not something that is happening right now, unfortunately. It is easier for the everyday person concerned about their planet to be informed of food alternatives rather than alternatives for a technology that is hard to grasp even for the tech savvy. Maybe one day we’ll get there. But Bitcoin is in its infancy. 
And lastly, worrying about the bigger problems should be focused on much more harshly than energy issues that arise from Bitcoin. Realizing that there are much bigger problems damaging our planet is something A LOT of people have trouble accepting and doing something about, introducing them to solution for that is much more ideal. In a perfect world, all the problems would be addressed and given the attention they deserve, but this far from a perfect world. 
Being realistic about what you want out of the Bitcoin community is step 1 towards progress. The majority are in this for their own benefit, not that of that planet. We should educate patiently. Address the big issues, try to discuss the smaller issues, build from there.

Gemini can let you do that sure.
But selling everytime the price drops and assuming you will buy back cheaper is testing the waters and you could lose more money this way. 
Just keep your coins stored.

If there’s a crash tomorrow and he is not prepared-is the risk worth it this early on?
I’m all for bitcoin, but the uncertainty is too much for me to live comfortably. Not now at least, 10%, 20%, even 50% of your savings can be in Bitcoin, but leaning towards having your source of income to ONLY be bitcoin is not ideal. At least not for the average person and  definitely not this year.

I recommend Gemini for cheaper fees and faster verification. They tend to have better customer service-which is great for beginners.
Although recently they did have their site offline for hours due to an overwhelming amount of people visiting the site when the small crash happened, they are back up now. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:45:05
Uhh... 
I would stick with 1 
That’s my personal opinion though. I know myself and dealing with 24 words is stressful enough, 48  or even 72 words I have to keep safe will drive me nuts. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:48:45
I have hopes that MAYBE towards the end of next year. But for sure 2019 at some point.

I wonder how you think FIAT currency is truly working for society......

Directing you towards the sidebar. It has the majority of the information needed to get started. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:46:36
Well you need to plug it in to copy the receiving address lol. Once you confirmed the transaction on Electrum you can see the amount pop up on the ledger. Confirmation is a different story but you can unplug once you have the receiving address copied on clipboard

Yes. 
And you can use coinbase to buy instantly with credit card if you decide not to wait a week for bank transfers. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:53:30
That sucks man. I don’t know what to tell ya. You’re on Gemini which is a much cheaper place to buy Bitcoins and free to transfer out too. Maybe wait until the network isn’t so overwhelmed and see if the fee changes.

@_date: 2017-12-05 09:35:27
Let’s say you bought $10 worth of Bitcoin. 
Okay. You have the Bitcoin now and you’re gonna buy coffee. 
The coffee is gonna cost you $2. You use your Bitcoin and $2 worth of Bitcoin will be deducted from your Bitcoin wallet.
You drink the coffee- you’re happy. The coffee is gone.
Let’s say though, the market value price of Bitcoin drops from $10k to $5k. The $8 worth of Bitcoin you currently have will decrease in value. It won’t be $8 anymore, it will be much less.
But let’s say Bitcoin’s market value reaches $20k. Those $8 worth of Bitcoin you have just increased to a much higher amount. That coffee that you bought, you bought for $2 worth of Bitcoin AT THAT TIME, because that’s what it was worth. Now, if you go back and try to buy coffee the price of the coffee won’t change, that’s up to the store, but the amount of Bitcoin you use to buy that coffee will change.

No problem!
Of course you can have multiple wallet applications installed. It’s safe. Just make sure you’re sending your bitcoins to the correct address. 
That 12 word seed that Breadwallet gives you, keep that safe and don’t share with anyone. Those 12 words are your bitcoins and they are just as important as the password to your bank account.

You’re right. You shouldn’t keep your coins on there. 
I recommend Breadwallet. It’s quick and easy to set up. It’ll be secure. Just remember to keep your 12 word seed safe.

Personally, I believe the answer is no. 
Only you can stop forest fir....
I mean, uh.
Only you can determine when you want to leave the ride. If you think it’s the peak, don’t stress yourself out -leave with your earnings. I can tell you everyday for the next month that bitcoin will go up higher and higher, but who knows? I don’t. No one does. We can’t predict the future and therefore can’t determine when it’s time to cash out. 
A suggestion would be to sell your initial investment and remain in the game with your earnings. That way it doesn’t feel like you’ve invested more than you’re comfortable with.

The only way someone can hack into your Electrum is if your computer is infected with something like a keylogger. 
When you use a software wallet like Electrum, you have to trust that your computer is safe against attacks. 
If you don’t trust your computer or your phone, get a hardware wallet, like a ledger nano s or Trezor. Both store your private keys OFFLINE, so it never touches the internet. You can plug it in to an infected computer and you would be safe. 
I only recommend getting a hardware wallet for long term storage and if you have an amount you’re worried about losing.

I recommend that you first build a pretty decent savings account in case of an emergency.

@_date: 2017-11-11 04:07:15
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:10:15
Yus. 
Use GDAX. Lower fees but you do have to wait for your deposits to go through- which usually take 4 days but sometimes up to a week.
You can always link your bank account to Coinbase and buy from there, locking in the price but you’ll be waiting for the actual bitcoins to be placed in your account. 
There’s also the option of buying with a credit card which imposes the highest fees but will deposit the bitcoins instantly.
I always suggest looking at the market and deciding what payment option is more suitable for you. 
Also, once your bitcoins are purchased transfer them to GDAX. GDAX is owned by Coinbase and once your bitcoin are there you are able to transfer them to your wallet for free.
Never leave your bitcoins on an exchange like Coinbase because until you have your coins in your own wallet, they are not your coins. 
I suggest the electrum desktop wallet for starting out. It’s open source. And very well trusted. Make sure you install this on a secure computer. If you think it may be compromised opt for a wallet on your phone.
Never share your private keys with anyone you do not trust. And welcome, bitcoiner :) 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:25:26
If the funds are not withdrawn yet and the money is desperately needed- withdraw the money now and eat the overdraft fees as well as the negative balance. 
Best bet is to keep calling them. We can’t do much, it’s their company.
Never invest more than you’re willing to lose. This has been repeated countless times here. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:17:45

Directly from your bank to GDAX through regular ACH transfer takes 3-5 business days and there is no fee. A wire transfer, which carries a $10.00 fee will be available much faster (usually same day). After the money gets deposited, the funds will be readily available to buy bitcoins and they will instantaneously show. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:23:55

Ahhh the HODL app 
( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) the numbers are getting me excited 
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:55:35
I believe they don’t link bank accounts that way.  Your purchases were probably cancelled because the price rise and fall was something that was messing with the system. A lot of people weren’t able to purchase at the lowest point in the dip. 
I suggest trying later today or simply sign in using your banks username and password and after the entire transaction is completed-delete the linked accounts.

So, for the receiving address you copied and pasted-you are 100% certain that it is from your Trezor, right? 
Maybe you accidentally pasted a different address. Where are you seeing this other address? The GDAX page? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:33:05
Haha. Waiting on Tuesday for my money to deposit. Not mad though. The future is bright! 
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:46:07
Yes. Several thousand. If you look at this sub, the new posts are people dealing with long transaction waiting periods. This is due to the clogging experienced by miners mining BCH. But right now miners have switched back to BTC and the periods aren’t as long as they were just a day ago. Be patient. Avoid making any unnecessary transactions. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:01:55
Consider mining alt coins. As they are easier to mine and will be more profitable for you.
It’s not too late. Especially if you believe in the technology and consider giving back to the community by spreading the word. Also buy bitcoin with the amount of money you’re willing to lose-the monthly amount you’re thinking about sounds like a safe amount while you settle back home after college. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:55:04

@_date: 2017-11-14 08:03:46
You’re right- less tech savy people are more inclined to go for the hardware wallet. 
I believe recommendations to purchase a hardware wallet stem from that exact fact-a lot of newcomers aren’t going to be comfortable handling the concept that their thousand dollar investment is in a piece of paper that could be easily destroyed. I guess the idea doesn’t sit well with many people. A hardware wallet offers, in a sense, an extra layer of comfort and protection.
With the already overwhelming amount of information, the easy thing to do is point people to hardware wallets once they feel they can make a hefty investment. 
I don’t agree however, that someone wanting to invest 50 bucks on cryptocurrency should drop 70-100 bucks on a hardware wallet. 
People should do their research and find what fits their personal wants/needs. The intermediary that was once their banks is no longer there and extra responsibility falls on the hands of the people. 
Edit: Thank you for the post by the way. Very well written and I am sure it will be extremely helpful to current and future bitconers!

That’s me when I transfer what I’m willing to lose and then after 1 week of waiting for Coinbase to have the funds, I have more money I’m willing to lose but then it’s too late and I have to repeat the process again. But that’s okay because I am allocating at different averages. 
Phew. Bitcoin is stressful.

It’s the same chain spilt and that spilt is exactly how the ledger nano s wallet has it on its chrome app. Sometimes funds appear on the legacy chain rather than the segwit chain.

@_date: 2017-11-26 09:10:48
It matters because if for example he tried to send bitcoin from an exchange or another wallet to his nano s wallet, then the coins might be in the legacy chain rather than the segwit chain or vice versa. Check both chains within the wallets options and see what that shows you.

Yes! You can try allthingsdecentral. Google it and it’s a store where you can buy all type of crypto currency merchandise. They also sell hardware wallets and specifically- ledger nano s. They are posted on the ledger’s official website as a trusted retailer for the product. Also, they are having a 15% discount I believe today only though so hurry it up. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:02:19
Crazy plan?
No. 
Is bitcoin reliable enough to do it?
No. 
A lot of people tend to invest more than they are willing to lose. If you are willing to lose your entire savings account to a violate currency like Bitcoin. Then do it. 
If you are not, then don’t and invest periodically when you have extra cash. 
Bitcoin is very volatile at its current state. Where one month you could
turn your 2k into a 500 profit. The other month your 2k can dwindle down to 1,500. 
Though it has always had an upward trend with scary dips in the past, if you have faith in bitcoin I suggest investing some of your savings now and some later. It’s called dollar-cost averaging. You have a fixed amount, let’s say 2k, you can put that money into bitcoin at regular intervals over a long period of time. That way your money is spread out and you’re not too emotionally attached to the certain market value you bought in at.
I wish the best of luck! 
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:01:56
What’s the cheapest you’re looking to get for it?
Allthingsdecentral has it for roughly 71 or 72 bucks with their 10% discount

Unfortunately, no one can answer this. We can’t predict the market value a few seconds from now much less 2 weeks. It’s very up and down. The trend though, is that Bitcoin has always gone up. 
Good luck.

I suggest you call their customer service number on Monday. Also, post it on their subreddit and make it known that you will lawyer up if this isn’t resolved. 
Be stern but also don’t lose your shit. Some of their customer service representatives truly want to help-but they do have some SHIT customer service response time.
Also,  are you in the U.S? If you are, you are FDIC insured and they NEED to tell you where your money is. If not, file a complaint with your bank as well. 
Edit: I didn’t notice you mentioned the transaction left her account and into your Coinbase account. This could be your problem as another user mentioned. The accounts transferring FIAT into Coinbase must be under the name of the person who owns the Coinbase account. Still, call them and do everything possible to have this resolved. The money is floating out there and it belongs to you.

This is fair and true. 
Personally, investing in bitcoin has become a nice way for me to put faith in something different, new, and that will hopefully make the future better for everyone. Especially those who do struggle with poverty. Time will tell. 
It’s addicting to purchase Bitcoins. It’s even more addicting to watch the price rise and fall. The hype is real and that’s what attracts a lot of people. I hope many folks understand that Bitcoin wasn’t made to make you a millionaire.

You can send your bitcoin over to GDAX (it is owned by coinbase) and pay no fees to transfer your bitcoins over from there to electrum. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:24:44
Ehhhh 
With 1-2 bitcoins that’s already over 15k. If you’re comfortable with keeping it on your phone. Then by all means, but that’s a nice chunk of change. I would seriously consider a hardware wallet and transferring some bitcoin in there for storage and safety. Keep a smaller portion on your phone and still have the ability for smooth and fast transactions. 
As a side note: if you’re willing to risk 15k on a software wallet, why not spend $100 bucks on a hardware wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:10:20

The fact that you have so many restrictions and fees handling your own money with this bank I believe is a good reason to maybe switch to a credit union.

Bitcoin Diamond (BCD) is a fork of Bitcoin that occurs at the predetermined height of block 495866 and therewith a new chain will be generated as the BCD. Bitcoin Diamond miners will begin creating blocks with a new proof-of-work algorithm, and will consecutively develop and enhance the protection for account transfer and privacy based on original features of BTC. This will cause a bifurcation of the Bitcoin blockchain. The original Bitcoin blockchain will continue unaltered, but a new branch of the blockchain will split off from the original chain. It shares the same transaction history with Bitcoin until it starts branching and coming into a unique block from which it diverges. As a result of this process, a new cryptocurrency was created which we call “Bitcoin Diamond”.
And link for those curious:

The fucked up part about this is that if they are showing it was transferred to that other address, there’s nothing you can do to get your bitcoin back.

I had something like this in mind. It would give the group the ability to meet fellow bitconers in their area.

Thank you. Quick question. Does this newly placed fee add onto the original fee I paid? So let’s say I paid $0.33 for the first transaction. Will I be paying, $0.33 + $3.70 or just $3.70 (the fee I am replacing the old one with).

You mean not a full bitcoin that costs roughly 7k USD right now? 
Yes, you don’t need to buy one whole bitcoin. You can  buy a fraction of a bitcoin. Try inputting the amount of money you are willing to pay into an exchange like GDAX and see how much bitcoin that money can buy you.

Overpriced when ledger nano s provides the same services for cheaper. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:06:08
First. Once your ledger nano s is connected to your computer and you go on the google app. You then want to go to settings (upper left) and then click the option that says “coin”. There go to the transactions portion and select low( slow confirmation) from the drop down options. 
By doing that, whenever you want to transfer bitcoins from your ledger nano s to another wallet or exchange, you will be paying low fees but waiting longer.
For Electurm, once you open it and look on the lower right, you’re gonna see little tools, that’s your preference options. Click on it and once it opens click on the fees tab, and make sure use dynamic fees is unselected and edit fees manually is selected. Close that up and then go to your send tab. There you are going to input the receiving address, and the amount of BTC you want to send. Below that, you will see a fees section. If you want the lowest possible fee move the slider all the way to the left. Keep in mind, doing so will have you waiting quite some time for a confirmation. 
That’s it. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:32:24
Any wallet implementation of BIP39 will be able to recover those bitcoins if you plug those words into it. Electrum uses BIP39.
So, if you lose, break, or have your ledger nano s stolen, you can basically import those words into any wallet that supports BIP39/BIP44 and you’ll see your bitcoins again.
Think of it this way, those 12 or 24 words ARE your bitcoin. Without them, you don’t own bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:53:00
Buying during an ATH. My man.
Congrats and keep those coins safe! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:29:07
When you open up the Electrum wallet the receiving address is going to be located on the tab that says “receive.”
You look where it says “receiving address” and you copy that onto your clipboard.
Go to GDAX and click on withdraw. Go to BTC address. Chose the amount you would like to withdraw of bitcoins. And in the destination portion, paste the address you just copied from Electrum. Triple check the address pasted matches the one shown on your Electrum wallet exactly. 
It’s going to ask you confirm any two factor code you may have. Confirm it. And then click withdraw funds. 
It’s free to do this through GDAX. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:42:32

If you have an immense amount of bitcoins. Then separating your assets in different hardware wallets can be good for you. 
I personally don’t find it necessary. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:05:27
If you are holding a hefty amount of bitcoins, I suggest never ever leaving it on any exchange ever again. I read this analogy somewhere on here that compared an exchange to the Cookie Monster and your bitcoins are the cookies. It’s like telling the Cookie Monster to keep an eye on your cookies. You come back one day and those cookies are gone, you wonder why, right? 
Always have your own private wallet. Hardware wallets and paper wallets are the most secure. But if you download a software wallet like Electurm and keep it on a secure   computer, you will be fine as well. 
Again, best of luck and I hope your issue is resolved quickly. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:58:46

I am also all for HODLING bitcoin- until something better comes along. 
The simple truth is that I’m in it for me and my family. That’s it. I want the best for my wife, kids, myself, friends, community. I would be a fool to deny the existence of something better in the future. When the time comes, selling and moving forward is wise. Though emotionally I have grown attached to bitcoin and it’s community, things need to change in order for its success. 
Who’s to say we all can’t move forward together? This technology is new and scary for a lot of people. No point in leaving each other behind. 
As for my speculation of the day, I think bitocin will reach a max of 10k by the end of the year and then drop back down to 7k for correction. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:16:56
Like a CD for fiat money? 
I personally don’t know of any wallet that will lock you out of your bitcoins on purpose and if you try to remove it, impose a high withdrawal fee.

Are you SURE he got the address wrong?

I’m glad you got it to work the 2nd time around. Always good to triple check the receiving address. I guess that other address is in for a small surprise lol.  Think of it as a donation to the community and keep moving forward. More bitcoin to come. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 08:04:54
This sucks my friend :/ 
I don’t see how it could have ended on the other address. Things don’t add up. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:29:04
It’s lower to simply send bitcoin from one wallet to another or from a wallet to an exchange. You can not buy bitcoins with a Trezor wallet because it’s just a wallet not an exchange. And the same applies to a ledger nano s wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:38:26
Okay-I’m getting 0 BTC too.
When transferring from GDAX to Trezor, did you send at least the minimum account required to start a transfer. GDAX has a minimum amount of BTC needed before they would issue a transfer to your wallet. How much did you transfer? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:06:40
6,750 now

I am both subscribed here and over there. I’ve mentioned before that they tend to do a lot of bashing-far more than what you see here. 
There seems to be this anger between the community that is splitting us up and we need to stray away from that and focus on the technology. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:50:59
You sold it at 9950
You will get whatever amount you received when selling it at 9950. 
The amount you earned selling doesn’t change. It’s staying the amount the transaction ended up being.

Too many horror stories to continue supporting Coinbase. Although I do enjoy paying no fees in GDAX. What other exchange provides exceptional customer service with GDAX’s lower transaction fees?

This reminds me of how badly I debated in my head on explaining to my mid 40s mother how it works too. 
Me: “So, mom there’s this up and coming currency called Bitcoin”
Her: “Up and coming you say?”
Me: “Yeah! Think of the dollar bill but better and well-virtual!”
Her: “What’s it’s value?”
Me: “Around 5k per coin”
Her:“What are you waiting for? Put some of my money in it, you trust it right?”
Lmfao. We made a profit as son and mother.

Welcome to the team.
Keep them safe in a wallet. 
Also, buy from GDAX. It is owned by the same people who own Coinbase. You don’t need to make a new account with them, just reconfirm your login when going to the GDAX website. There your fees are lower, so low that you pay 0% fees to purchase and sell bitcoin and 0% fee to transfer those bitcoins to your wallet of choice. I encourage you to watch YouTube videos on navigating through GDAX. 
Happy bitcoining! 
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:38:49
Welcome! So happy to see the family growing!

@_date: 2017-11-26 05:36:58
Nothing other than the fact that people are willing to buy and sell bitcoin at that price range. The market is controlled by the makers of it. GDAX itself isn’t making the price higher or lower than it should be.

A transcript of Donald Trump talking to the press makes more sense than this. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:26:12
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:54:06
Yes, you’re right. Either way, you would have to wait until your transfer is deposited to even use GDAX. Of course you can use wire transfers but that does include a $10.00 fee and the transfer isn’t instantly in your account-though usually it is the day of. 
For big dips as we have seen today, using a credit card would seem more ideal because you lock in the price and the crypto currency is in your account right away. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:56:50

Do you remember maybe copying that other address onto your clipboard from another transaction you attempted to make? Maybe another wallet you have? From tipping someone? Something? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:02:43
From GDAX to electurm is free 
From any wallet to an exchange or another wallet is not free due to miners fee.

@_date: 2017-11-26 06:10:24
It is not the best way to do it if you want your bitcoins right away. A pro is that you lock in to whatever price it was at the time of purchase. A con is that you really do have to wait about a week to see the bitcoins in your account. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:58:31
As Canadians say, I’m sorry.

@_date: 2017-11-23 21:37:33
3 years ago we didn’t have the amount of people we have today. 
It’s important to discuss this to newcomers and explain the situation as a whole. Attacks against bitcoin aren’t something new here-but it is new to people who are just getting started. Explaining rather than dismissing is important. I’m all for never speaking of BCH, but more and more people are being pulled into that scam. Keeping posts informing people of the situation is key to moving forward as well. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:38:05
Welcome, child. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:59:31
Of course you can profit off of this. But I do not recommend to do so with the amount of debt you have and what you make monthly. 
You need to focus on your day to day  finances before you focus on investing. Put money towards your debt and look for a job that can help you get rid of that debt faster. Once you have money leftover you can look into Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:46:19
This response sounded like this to OP:
“Yes. The overflow of new currency will doohickey the price, which will then fluctuate the submarine levels for the next couple of quartz until it hits the MALL. Then it should biggity bounce back and meet Jesus in heaven”
