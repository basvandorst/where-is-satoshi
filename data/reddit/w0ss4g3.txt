RAID1 is kind of a backup, in that if one drive fails you have a mirror of it on the other(s).
Of course, that doesn't help if you delete a file, have a problem which corrupts the data (and is mirrored to all drives) or if the machine explodes.
It's still a lot better than relying on a single drive - I've saved 100s of gigs of data (nothing mission critical, but still a pain if it'd been lost) because of RAID1.
Definitely wouldn't rely on it as a wallet backup though!

Your last sentence is my feeling. I don't think Bitcoin is a good replacement for local currency, and especially for point-of-sale transactions - reasons being storage and delay of confirmations.
However, it serves as a good means of payment for online transactions (where a delay in delivery is inevitable), particularly over national borders with different currency. I see it as a paypal replacement where anyone in the world can send money across the world for a minimal fee.
This is essentially what BitPay and Coinbase do.. although someone with rupees from india wanting to buy something in dollars from the USA is still going to have problems unless they can get hold of bitcoins with their rupees. Eventually I see most of these markets being filled by local BTC conversion companies who are able to keep the cost of transfers down due to the low fee's involved in BTC transactions.
I've been into bitcoin since early 2011/late 2010 and I've always thought of it in this sense.. it's not a replacement currency, it's a financial transaction method. This is why I bothered to acquire some bitcoin in the first place. The fact that those BTC are now worth hundreds of times more than when I acquired them (sadly I didn't make as much as I could've.. I never envisaged the price being anywhere near as high as it is now) is not why I like bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-16 13:17:36
I disagree. Bitcoin can serve as a transaction medium for currency in an international sense and work very nicely alongside the local currency. The rate of exchange isn't particularly important except that it needs stability, so that someone can buy bitcoin, send it to whoever they wish and that person can convert to their local currency without the price changing vastly in the hours/days it takes to do that.
For that use, it doesn't devalue either the sending or receiving currency and serves as a financial lubricant.

Since the database is compromised, then an attacker could have your password hash, but not your password. If this is a phishing attempt, and you log in, they can now get your password and still make it look legit - compare to the hash they have.. let you log in.. show your balance, etc.
Sure if you've got a unique password on gox, it's probably not a big deal.. although if by some miracle gox do end up letting people claim their money back then giving your password away might not be a great idea.

I'm aware of that - I'm in Europe and it's made very clear if you're buying directly from amazon, from a third party via amazon (i.e. fulfilled by amazon), or from a third party. I tend to stick to ordering things such that amazon is directly responsible for shipping/customer service.. if not, I'll look at the seller's feedback and their own website too (sometimes it's cheaper).
What I was getting at is that the buyer is interested only in ways to protect their purchase. If the seller tries to dictate a payment method which gives the customer less protection, they're probably going to lose out in the long run to sellers who use the payment method with consumer protection.

It doesn't require magic.. I don't know where you've conjured that from! I'm sorry, but it's just incredibly clear that a government is not an individual. Your comments about physical actions have nothing to do with it.
That's how it works in a democracy, the majority rule, and the government represents everyone, even if they did not choose those in the government. It is impossible to please everyone.. this is the pragmatic choice. You appear to come from a position of idealism, which I don't think has any real foundation in reality.

While this is a good post and thanks for making it. I'd also add that being entirely focused on dollar price is ignoring the actual utility of bitcoin, which is to transfer money in return for services and goods. If all you use bitcoin for is to speculate and try to turn a profit, you're simply damaging bitcoin in the long term.
I'm not saying spend everything you have (and day-trading does have some benefits), actually using bitcoins to purchase goods/services will do far more to establish it as a serious currency. On top of that, if your intent was to buy goods with whatever money you have now, changing from dollars -&gt; bitcoin -&gt; spend on goods leaves you with no risk of losing your money and allows you to get the transaction done without involving any fee-charging entities like paypal :)
Oh one other tip, going against everything I've just said: When trading on exchanges like Mt Gox, DON'T FORGET THE TRANSACTION FEE, especially when day trading! I've seen lots of posts of people being bitten by this.

How does bitpay handle fraud on the merchant's end? What if the customer wants a refund and the merchant doesn't want to give one?
@_date: 2013-04-06 20:26:11
It doesn't work that way. A node is simply another connection in the p2p network. When you download the blockchain and have it up to date, you are relaying that information to the other peers you are connected to. You don't have to be mining to relay the blockchain.
On top of that, when you make a transaction you broadcast your wish to do so to everyone you are directly connected to, they relay this to everyone they're connected to, and so on until it hits a node which is also acting as a mining node. If the mining server accepts your transaction (e.g. it likes your fee or has space in its allocation of free transactions) it will include your transaction in the next block it creates. At the same time, other mining nodes which hear about your transaction are deciding to include it or not. Once one of them has included your transaction in their block, it takes the fee and it is added to the blockchain - the other miner nodes then hear about this and remove it from their list of "to-be-included transactions".
Without enough nodes, the lag to transmit information across the network increases, and the bandwidth available to send the blockchain to people is reduced. Essentially, running a node by keeping the client open is very important to the maintenance of the network, even if it is not mining.

I agree to some degree, but there were new shops accepting bitcoins opening all the time back then too. There was media interest too, although I'll admit not quite to the degree we're seeing in the last few weeks.. it was certainly in the mediastream media at the time though.. here's a quick example: 
The biggest difference I can see is that "big" websites such as reddit and megaupload are accepting bitcoin, all the rest is "same old same old". Read that article though.. if you took the date off it, you could easily mistake it for being written a few days ago

The rate of return on hardware is significantly lower today than it was in 2011. I could risk buying ASICs, but they will have next to no resale value if bitcoin were to tank. I simply took advantage of what I had available.
You also have to factor in the effort of maintaining mining rigs. That time is valuable to me.

I actually think this is the best use for bitcoin. It makes transferring money over distances an incredibly efficient procedure if (and this is the big if) it is quick and easy to convert the BTC to your local currency.
Currently this isn't the case and that's a huge problem. I also don't see it improving anytime soon because a business will always want to make money on the service.. and the market rate will be set by the competitors (i.e. Banks, western union, paypal, etc). It may make the fees slightly lower, but only in the same way that paypal did.
In my mind the ideal scenario would be a local p2p-style exchange of BTC to local currency (ala localbitcoins), but this requires enough people using BTC in your local area in order to work. It's a bit of a catch-22.
@_date: 2013-03-25 01:41:26
Well a bitcoin wallet will have a pool of 100 addresses plus those you already seen/generated. Everytime you create a new wallet in the client, it adds another to that pool of 100.. so really you'd have had that address either way. Here's a bit of info on that: 
You could use the info in "Making a new wallet" from that link to "remove" your extra address - i.e. back-up current wallet, make a whole new wallet, generate the addresses you want, back it up, copy the old wallet back in, send all your funds to the addresses in the new wallet. Not exactly very clean, but it'd work.
Anyway, if you really want to do actually delete the address from your current wallet, you can use pywallet, found here:

No worries. I've got a 7870XT (similar card, but with lower memory bandwidth and fewer stream processors) and I get my best hashrate with vectors off, worksize of 128 and intensity 10. Obviously play about with it yourself.
I'd guess a higher worksize would work well for the 7950 because it's got a 384-bit memory bus (mine has 256-bit). Lowering the memory clock seems to help a bit too and keeps temperatures down. Also I've overclocked the core on mine from 975 up to 1100 (~12.5% overclock) and get pretty much a 12.5% increase in hashrate.
Best of luck :)

This isn't actually true... It's completely open to how much you're spending and how busy the network is right now (in order to get it processed quickly you'll need a higher fee). Bitcoin offers the chance to send larger amounts at very low transaction costs, but microtransactions are a different matter.
@_date: 2013-03-30 18:03:46
Fair point, if priced right by the payment handling (e.g. BitPay), then it could be a better deal for the shop owner than using the more widely established processors.

I agree to an extent, but someone using a paper wallet has likely done their homework in some way to find out about it. The fault partly lies with people making paper wallet guides and not making this point explicitly clear.
Sending the change to the sending address also makes it very clear how much was transferred to another person and theoretically makes it easier to identify people and so it would make bitcoin less anonymous. It also reveals the public key of your address which is slightly easier to break via brute force than the address on its own (still effectively impossible right now). The intention by the developers was to encourage using a new address for every transaction to keep things as anonymous/secure as possible.
@_date: 2013-04-14 13:54:51

Try disabling and/or increasing the worksize, if you're not using the machine while it's running, you could increase the intensity too
Vectors  + worksize 128 (could try 256 and 384), high intensity
{ "pools" : [ { "url" : " "user" : "XXXX", "pass" : "XXXX" } ] , "intensity" : "10", "vectors" : "1", "worksize" : "128", "kernel" : "poclbm", "lookup-gap" : "0", "thread-concurrency" : "0", "shaders" : "0", "gpu-engine" : "0-0", "gpu-fan" : "0-85", "gpu-memclock" : "0", "gpu-memdiff" : "0", "gpu-powertune" : "0", "gpu-vddc" : "0.000", "temp-cutoff" : "95", "temp-overheat" : "85", "temp-target" : "75", "api-port" : "4028", "expiry" : "120", "gpu-dyninterval" : "7", "gpu-platform" : "0", "gpu-threads" : "2", "hotplug" : "5", "log" : "5", "no-pool-disable" : true, "queue" : "1", "scan-time" : "60", "temp-hysteresis" : "3", "shares" : "0", "kernel-path" : "/usr/local/bin" }
vectors off, worksize 128 (intensity default):
{ "pools" : [ { "url" : " "user" : "XXXX", "pass" : "XXXX" } ] , "intensity" : "d", "vectors" : "0", "worksize" : "128", "kernel" : "poclbm", "lookup-gap" : "0", "thread-concurrency" : "0", "shaders" : "0", "gpu-engine" : "0-0", "gpu-fan" : "0-85", "gpu-memclock" : "0", "gpu-memdiff" : "0", "gpu-powertune" : "0", "gpu-vddc" : "0.000", "temp-cutoff" : "95", "temp-overheat" : "85", "temp-target" : "75", "api-port" : "4028", "expiry" : "120", "gpu-dyninterval" : "7", "gpu-platform" : "0", "gpu-threads" : "2", "hotplug" : "5", "log" : "5", "no-pool-disable" : true, "queue" : "1", "scan-time" : "60", "temp-hysteresis" : "3", "shares" : "0", "kernel-path" : "/usr/local/bin" }
Finally, overclock the core and downclock the RAM as low as it'll go. You should see 600-700 with a 7950.

@_date: 2013-04-25 17:23:36
That's not quite true. More miners (both solo and more pools) = a more secure network. A select few (those with ASICs) having the majority of hashing power is a bad thing and makes the network less secure.
I'm quite interested to see which way this goes as GPU mining becomes unprofitable due to reduced rewards.

The crash in 2011 was very similar. There was a big peak.. then a big sell off, then lots of bad news, hacking, scams, etc. It took a good few months for the price to fully fall from the peak of ~$30 down to $5 (and subsequently all the way to ~$2). The stuff people were saying then is just like now. Nothing in the fundamentals had changed then either yet it still happened. Of course it could be different this time, but I'm not willing to bet too much on it!

The definition of theft is the act of stealing. The definition of stealing is to take without permission or legal right (with respect to property). The legal right of taxation by the state is written into the law, so you're wrong.

By doing so, they are no longer part of the bitcoin network and are simply a user.

I actually mine on slush with about 50% of my hashrate.. I wasn't complaining about the bad luck, just trying to provide an insight into some of the more inexperienced miners behaviour.
I know how it works out over the long term, and trying to game it in the short term usually ends up with egg on your face. However in the few first days/weeks of getting into mining people will probably pay more attention to their daily returns and become frustrated if they see another pool doing better and end up switching (i.e. their perception of the variance is the problem). The influx of new miners (coming in with the recent attention bitcoin has received) is what I think has caused BTCGuild's share to increase recently, coupled with the particularly slick interface and early accommodation of ASICs, etc.
@_date: 2013-03-30 17:15:35
ASICs don't account for the majority of hashing power, not yet anyway.. more like 20-30%. They're produced in China because that's where the majority of the world's silicon fabrication done (e.g. most GPUs are fab-ed in China too)... makes sense for the companies to be based there.

Alright, calm down angry man. Anyone who says "the amount of luck required" is pretty unlikely to have any formal mathematical training in probability and statistics.
It also sounds like you were playing roulette (an "unfair" game) rather than 50% satoshidice as OP was.
Did you calculate the number of spins you'd be required to do in order to get a profit with (say) 99% certainty? Did you use this calculation to set the initial bet you made, or did you use the minimum?
Wouldn't you think that a casino would set the minimum bet (and typically set a maximum bet) so that this lands in their favour?

Do you not see how this kind of goes against the idea of the decentralised and p2p system?
The whole point (at least to me) is that it was different to the current available systems of currency. I've been using bitcoin for over 2 years now and attitudes are just getting more and more like the current system and not solving any problems.
There seems to be a big catch 22. It's meant to be revolutionary, but in order for it to become mainstream you have to make it accessible to the average person.. i.e. make it seem familiar. Then you just end up back in the same situation as before and it feels like simply paying in my local currency with a credit card is just as effective for me. Still, I effectively get free money just from leaving a machine running in the corner of my office, so guess I shouldn't complain.
Of course bitcoin itself hasn't changed.. just how it's users appear to be using and thinking about it.

Here's my working (let's assume the difficulty won't change, although in reality it'll go up):
best case scenario: ~450MH/s ( core.. which is pushing it tbh)
(2^(32))/450000000 = 9.544371769 (average number of seconds to find a difficulty 1 share)
gives 6.286427379 shares per minute
gives 9053 shares per day (rounded up)
At current difficulty the average value of a share is ~0.0000024
Giving 0.0217272 BTC per day, or 0.651816 per month.
The reality is going to be a lot less since there will be 2 difficulty increases per month.

Given that the DDOS was almost certainly carried out by a botnet, that seems like a pretty wild claim. If the time of the DDOS was in the evening in the UK, then more computers in the botnet were probably switched on in London (being the most populated city in the UK). It's also possible that some machines on connections with large amounts of bandwidth are part of the botnet (e.g. university machines on JANET). There are plenty of equally (or more so) plausible explanations for the origin of a large amount of traffic being from one place than there being some government/corporate conspiracy against bitcoin.

$500 buys ~3 bitcoins
$500 buys a rig (just about manage a single 7950 or 2x7790s) capable of generating ~0.03 (edit: since I'd based it on a hugely overclocked card) a day at current difficulty.. which has been rising sharply every ~2 weeks and shows very little sign of stopping (ASICs are coming plus more miners using GPUs)... so you should expect your payouts to drop every 2 weeks.. so currently you should expect about 0.5 per 2 weeks at current difficulty.. then it'll drop by ~15-20% and so on.
Just do the sums and decide from that. The only benefit of buying a mining rig with a GPU is that you still have some resale value in the components. If you buy the BTC and the price drops heavily you're screwed in the short term.
edit: theoretically there are ASICs for under $500, but I've seen little evidence they're going to be shipping anytime soon, which is why I only mentioned the GPU rig.. plus an ASIC will have little resale value beyond BTC mining.
extra edit: lowered my estimates to assume overclocking is minimal

This is just as possible in a cash purchase scenario (suppose no one saw you hand him money, or there was no CCTV). Although it is easier to do with bitcoins.
Anyway, can I suggest something for the future? - if you're paying cash  (in this case BTC, but it could've been USD) for something upfront, ask the seller to sign a invoice/receipt as you carry out the transaction. That way you have evidence which you could submit to a court.
However, the fact that you let him leave without protesting or accusing him of theft is the reason he got away with it, not the bitcoin transaction.
Having said all of that.. you've learned a lesson and it hasn't actually cost you very much money - could've easily have been more. Best of luck filing the police report and sorry it happened to ya dude :(

That's assuming that every new user connects at the same instant. In reality, as soon as a new user has blocks 0-X, then they can upload them to others, freeing up the bandwidth of nodes with the blocks beyond block X to upload to that new user and anyone else who needs it. The point is that once you have a a chunk of the blockchain, you are having contribution to upload bandwidth even if you're still downloading the rest of the chain

I didn't panic sell anything and you can't predict what the value of those coins will be. I made a decision based on my observations of the market behaviour and on the type of interest I was seeing in bitcoin on reddit, the media, everyday life, etc. I may be wrong, but I'm ok with that.
I kept a few BTC because I still believe in the idea.. not as a speculative tool, but as a medium of transaction.
There's a huge difference between a potential gain and an actual gain.

Honestly, mate, I've been skim reading most of people's replies because I've had about 100 in the last hour. While you may be making incredibly good points, I've not really had the time to read into them.. especially as theyre mainly peripheral to my points.
My statement about my dad is very simple: My dad required healthcare immediately. He was in a hospital within 15 minutes and they had him stable within an hour. He would've almost certainly died a very painful death had he not been taken care of so quickly.
This was all done without him having to be insured, without him having to pay a single penny afterwards. I understand that under private healthcare he would've been certainly had an equally swift treatment and recovery, but he'd have had an absolutely HUGE medical bill at the end of it. There is no guarantee he would've been covered by insurance (what happened to him could've happened to anyone.. it had nothing to do with his general health) as he may or may not have had it.
That is why I believe in public healthcare, because everyone should have the right to have their life saved and not be financially crippled for life because of it. This should be completely irrespective of their earnings, place of work or financial worth. That is a fundamental belief I hold and there is literally nothing anyone can say to change my mind on that matter.
Just because someone endangers their health further by being fat, or smoking, or driving too fast, or whatever, does not change that for me. To avoid people who take these risk causing an unfair burden on others, it's typical to place a higher tax on things which endanger health as a means of offsetting the expected cost of treating people due to those actions. It's all pretty simple to me.
This obviously doesn't cover things which are non-emergencies - things like cosmetic surgery, non-emergency treatment, etc - do it under a long waiting list with the option of private healthcare. It's not like I'm opposed to the option of private healthcare.
There. That's my logic. It stems from my fundamental belief that all people should be cared for in an emergency without the requirement of wealth. If you disagree with that, then fine - fuck you - we're not ever gonna agree.

I'm fine with everything except this:


GPUs are a required component for anyone who plays 3D games, I'm saying that plenty of people (beyond the minority of hardcore miners who are also the ones who I think are buying the majority of ASICS) didn't buy their cards purely for bitcoin, or they at least factored in that the cards have resale value.
I started GPU mining in 2011 on some cards I happened to have. There was no way I'd have bought a card especially to mine. If I'd encountered bitcoin today instead of 2+ years ago, I wouldn't bother with it because I'd be unable to obtain a few BTC to play with. Yes, I know the value has increased 10-fold since then, but the dollar-value wasn't really the point for me... I just thought it was cool. Maybe I'm wrong and people like me are the minority, but I'm not entirely convinced.
Maybe you're right though.. maybe cheap (say $10) USB ASICs will be a reality.

I didn't mean the reason to save in general. I mean the incentive to hoard bitcoins right now.
I wasn't saying that consumerism is a good thing. I mean that the reason people won't spend bitcoins on things (things they actually need) is that they think those bitcoins (when converted into their own currency) will buy more later. This is a very consumerist attitude.
The issue of depreciating value on people's money right now is because we're in recession. 10 years ago inflation was very low and interest rates were sky high - leaving your money in a savings account in the bank yielded a good return.

Usually there are good reasons such as fees, low volume or difficulty in withdrawing the funds, but if you can get funds into both exchanges quickly enough (or you already have them there), then you can gain from these. Sometimes you'll miss the opportunity and lose money though, so be careful. For your example the gain would be 2% if you could take full advantage - is that gain worth the risk of losing a larger percentage due to a large price dip?

Everything is built into the price, the volatility of the bitcoin exchange rate will be built into the price if the merchant is going to accept it directly. The fees from a bitcoin payment processor (e.g. bitpay) will also be built into the price if they go with that.
Essentially, as a consumer, you're not going to win. Saying that bitcoin somehow fixes this problem is a bit of a stretch.

**DISCLAIMER: Could lose your data/break your drives.. use at own risk etc**
You have a good chance assuming you've not written too much data to your drives.
You said there's 6? - I'd set aside a bit of time for this! I hope they're relatively small drives!
First up, get yourself a linux liveCD, ubuntu is a decent choice. I'll refer to you this page if you're using ubuntu, it should have everything you need: 
You'll want an external/spare drive which is larger than any of the other drives you're gonna be looking in.
I'd then connect 1 drive at a time, boot up the liveCD and make a copy of the drive using (assuming that /dev/sda is the drive you're going to copy, use sudo fdisk -l to check which one it is).
cat /dev/sda &gt; /path/to/external/drive/drive1.img
(You could use dd if=/dev/sda of=/path/to/external/drive/drive1.img, but I think cat should be faster)
I'd now shut down and disconnect the drive you're searching, you have an image of it now, so do your work on that. You want to start looking for hidden file tables within this img. You can use the tools suggested here: 
Once you've recovered the partition, you can mount it and then go searching for your wallet.dat. If you're sure it's not there, move onto the next drive and repeat the steps.
It's gonna take a while, but unless you've used the drive a lot after reformatting, you've got a good chance.
**EDIT**: Forgot to mention (I'm tired... about to go to bed), that there's info on finding a lost partition that you might've formatted over in this section: 
Again, it's much safer to work from an image of the drive, rather than the drive directly.
And one more helpful link:

That sounds an awful lot like "You're shit out of luck" to me and shows bitcoin up for being quite anti-consumer really...
Large organisations like Macy's/WalMart will already have very favourable deals with companies like VISA. They have next to zero incentive to accept bitcoin. The smaller companies are the ones who benefit from bitcoin and they are also the ones who are more likely to screw a customer over either through bad luck or malice.
The issue is that bitcoin lend themselves perfectly to online transactions. Online transactions are a lot more open to a poor experience for the consumer due to lack of face to face exchange, postage over distance, choosing the wrong product due to poor description/understanding, etc. The reason for all of the distance-selling regulations is because of this.
The only advantage for the customer is the possiblity of a small discount due to the lack of credit card fees on the merchant's end... in exchange for a large loss in consumer protection. You say use an escrow service - you're going to end up paying fees there.. why not just go with the credit card?
@_date: 2013-05-12 23:41:04
I guess so, you could import the private key, prepare the transaction, go online for a few moments to transmit the transaction (you'd want to ensure the change goes to a fresh offline wallet) and destroy the old wallet.
IMO, it's completely overkill. Simply keeping a netbook which only runs linux and a copy of a thin client along with a few backups of the wallet would be enough. It's fairly anti-social in terms of not helping maintain the bitcoin network.. but I spose you could run the client on another machine.

For brainwallets, using dictionary words with grammar is quite dangerous in terms of reducing entropy. It reduces the search space for brute-force attacks in a big way.
You'd do better to pick, say, 15 different words from various locations in a book (or several books) to avoid the grammar issue.
You could combine that with your own hash sequence (say sha512(sha256(md5(passphase)))) (just plucked this out of some popular hash functions) and then use that as your brainwallet generating passphrase to turn it into a private key. This would mean that even with your english words passphrase, unless someone knew the sequence of hashes you used to create the final passphrase for the private key, would be useless to someone.

If I were you, I'd export the private keys and start a new wallet (BACK UP THE OLD ONE!!!!), then import them into it, that should remove any stuck transactions which are causing you any problems.
You can do this with bitcoin-qt from the debug console (help -&gt; debug -&gt; console) by first unlocking your wallet (120 refers to unlock for 120 seconds, reduce/increase as you see fit):


Then export the private key of the address(es) you need:


repeat for each address and copy/paste those keys somewhere safe then relock the wallet:
Then close the client and rename the wallet in the bitcoin directory to something like wallet_original.dat
Reopen bitcoin-qt and let it create a new wallet. Then go back into the debug console and type:
importprivkey PRVIATEKEYHERE
wait while it syncs up, and repeat for each private key. Hey presto.. you should have the funds you can see in the addresses on blockchain.info.
You can then encrypt that new wallet and make new backups (keep a backup of the old one too if you're feeling paranoid).
I assume you can do the same sort of thing using Armoury, but I've not got much experience with it. Hope that sorts it out for you :)

I think the problem is the lack of people running the bitcoin client. Without enough nodes in the network to relay transactions then things take a long time to propagate.

As the difficulty increases and the blockchain gets longer (and larger), this problem is only going to get worse.

One point about GPUs (and CPUs before them) in terms of mining:
A GPU system has other uses - it has resale value. If bitcoin fails you can recover some of your money by selling it or at least use the system for other things. An ASIC miner is useless for anything else.
The other thing is that plenty of gamers have a GPU or even multiple GPUs available to hand - you can leave them running while you're not playing games.
You say that it requires wizardry, but tbh there was very little skill required to get a single GPU system up and running on a dual boot or bootable usb stick. Since the beginning of 2011 there have been extensive guides anyone can use to get a miner up and running in under an hour if your hardware is there.
The point here is that bitcoin was accessible to anyone with a little knowledge of computing (i.e. they know how to install an OS and which GPU they have).. which pretty much covers anyone with more than a passing interest in gaming. These people are now left out of it completely - there is now almost no point of them leaving their GPU mining.
Their only option is to either buy BTC directly (complicated by getting money into an exchange) or to buy an ASIC miner. Both of these require you to spend money on something which may end up being worthless. I think this is a large barrier to further adoption of BTC by the very demographic who it initially appealed to. I'm not convinced that this shortfall is going to be made up elsewhere.
As an aside: ASICs also put more network hashing power into the hands of fewer people. ASICMINER currently controls about 25% of the network for example, this is a very bad thing. The less accessible the network is to a general person, the less distributed it becomes and the less secure it becomes.

I want bitcoin to succeed as a transaction medium, not as a speculative tool. Since I first read about it in 2010 I've thought it was an excellent means of transaction for non-urgent payments (i.e. perfect for replacing paypal who I feel charge extortionate fees). For this to be viable, the price has to stabilise. The reason being that a volatile price means the only low-risk way to accept bitcoin is to use a service such as bitpay - what's to stop bitpay increasing their fees once they corner the market, just as ebay/paypal did. It simply centralizes the market again.
The idea that people have about it replacing banks is ludicrous as far as I'm concerned.

Does it work for the merchant who accepted 1 bitcoin on the basis that it was trading at ~$230 in exchange for something which he'd calculated his margins on receiving ~$230?
Now it's trading at ~$150 (mt gox says 160 but who knows how much lag is attached to that). How does the merchant buy new stock? - does he have to wait until it reaches ~$230 again?
If he doesn't he's probably just lost money. If he does he'll probably lose potential business by being out of stock.. who knows how long it'll take.
The usual reply is to say "Well just use bitpay". Well, great.. the payment processor has just moved away from VISA/paypal to someone else (who has been up and running for all of 5 minutes.. yes I know it's been open since July 2011, but that's relatively no time at all). It's not taking care of the issue of payment processor fees, it's just moving it somewhere else. The whole point of bitcoin was that it provided the means of practically fee-less payment over the internet.. if you need to use a proxy on top of that then it's completely pointless.

Can recommend localbitcoins.com - have used it to sell BTC for GBP. You can pay via bank transfer which will mean you'll pay minimal fees. It works like this:
- The seller puts the BTC in an escrow wallet (both of you must agree for the coins to be released from it).
- When you see the BTC are in the escrow wallet, you confirm you've sent payment and then send the bank transfer (I would personally always confirm you've paid just before you click send on the bank transfer.. you don't want to end up paying only for the seller to cancel before you confirmed).
- Once the seller has confirmation that you've paid, they release the escrow wallet to you, and then they appear in your localbitcoins wallet, which you can then transfer into your own wallet.
They do charge a small fee for the use of escrow - paid for by the seller - think it's 1%, so you can expect to pay a slightly higher price per BTC, but it's cheaper than the charges of getting money into/out of gox.
If you're hoping to do day trading, obviously go for the major exchanges like Mt Gox. I've traded on there and never had any issues.

Firstly, no it's not.
Secondly, even if it was that's irrelevant because when he exchanges the bitcoin for USD online he's going to have to withdraw that USD into a bank (unless he wants to attempt to sell that volume in person for cash, which is unlikely) which is very much easy to track.

I'm just gonna give you a little tip: try googling every question you have before posting it on ~~reddit/forums/etc~~ the internet, if you still can't find the answer, try rewording your question and googling again. If you still failed to find the answer, then you might want to post the question.
E.g. 


Jeez, take off the tinfoil hat. When I was using mtgox for GBP, the usual volume by this time of the day was nearly always under 1000GBP - it's a tiny market and has pretty much zero impact on the USD price, if anything it follows the USD market (just like pretty much every other market/exchange out there atm).

Ok, let's go with the UK:
I have a job, I pay income tax on the money I earn. I also pay my electricity bill with that money. When I pay my electricity bill, I am paying VAT on it. So when I mine BTC, I'm effectively paying two different taxes.
If I just bought BTC directly, I'm only paying incoming tax on the money I earned to buy it. Obviously if I sell the BTC then I am technically liable to pay capital gains tax if I make a profit, but I'd have to have total capital gains of more than £10k to be liable for that tax.
If the UK had a wide adoption of BTC, then you'd still have to pay VAT on items you buy with it, assuming shops still priced in GBP (which would include VAT) before converting to BTC for the sale. If they priced in BTC then I imagine it would be more complicated. It's possible there's a provision in the tax law for using non-GBP currencies, I'm not completely sure. However, if this became the norm, then I imagine the law would change pretty quick.
EDIT: I just thought about your idea that the government has no control over the money so that it would be impossible to tax it.
If you think about it, cash is just as out of control of the government. If you keep a big box of notes under your bed the government has just as hard a time knowing that it's there. The majority of UK tax evasion on the individual level is done by paying cash in hand - there's no paper trail. However, plenty of people get caught doing it.
Using bitcoin is no different. If the taxman comes asking how you support your lifestyle and you're unable to show any evidence of your income stream, you're going to find yourself being investigated further. If you still can't show any evidence, then you'll quickly find yourself being arrested. It's in your interest to keep a documentation of where your earnings come from so you can avoid this. The fact that the taxman can't find the money doesn't really matter here - they'll find evidence that you must be evading tax somehow and get you anyway.

My experience in life has given me a fairly different view. I'm not saying there arn't good people about, but the number of self-serving and selfish people is not insignificant either. IMO, it only takes a few to make everything worse for everyone.


The system is a representation of "us". What you're possibly missing is that the global "us" is not like the local "you". 
I disagree that people feel apathetic towards the system because they think the system is flawed. I think that plenty of people are apathetic towards the system because they have a comfortable life and don't care about what goes on outside of it - as long as they generally left alone they don't care.
What you propose requires people like that to take part in order to function efficiently. I'm saying that a large proportion of people wouldn't want to be involved - they just want to work their job, pay their tax and know that their healthcare, the education of their children and the general infrastructure is taken care of.
The current system suits them fine, even if they complain about small parts of it, it's never enough to actively do anything about it.
I'm not saying I agree that's how it should be, but that's the way it is in most first world countries. The only way people would rise up and get things to change quickly is if their quality of life was changed dramatically.
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:44:03
Overly simplified view and also wrong.
If the few producers of ASICs simply mined on them, they'd control the vast majority of hash power. This would undermine confidence in bitcoin transactions and most likely cause a large drop in the price - making the ASICs and the coins they mine worthless.
Given the initial investment required to actually produce the chips, there's a lot more to gain in maintaining confidence in the network and distributing them to as many as people as possible.
That initial investment also requires capital. By selling preorders (and fulfilling them) you can raise that capital and also lessen the risk you take on board should it fail.
In short, ASIC manufacturers would most likely cost themselves a very large amount of money if they were to mine themselves and not sell any.

Why would you want to do that?
There's no harm in having an unused address in your wallet. If anything it increases your chances of accidently getting free money into your wallet from 0 to ~1E-256
@_date: 2013-03-31 21:00:20
No. When you start your wallet, it generates 100 addresses in the background.
When you generate a receiving address, one of these becomes visible to you, and new address is created and added to the pool of 100 background addresses.
When you send coins from one of your visible addresses, it will send the whole balance: the amount you specificed to the address you chose and the remainder (or "change") to the next background address in your pool of 100, which now becomes "visible". Since you've now used 1 in that pool of 100 (99 left), it generates another so you still have that 100.
In bitcoin-qt, this all just happens without you seeing it happening since all you see is a final balance.
The problem occurs when you store your wallet outside of bitcoin-qt (e.g. by backing up to paper/usb, etc) and have used more than 100 of the background addresses between now and your last backup. If you were to restore the backup, it wouldn't be able to access any addresses used after the 100 background addresses it had when you backed it up.. in the worst case scenerio, you may have sent your entire balance to a change address that your backup knew nothing about. In this case and where you only have the backup, not the "live" wallet, your coins are lost.
Hope that makes sense and I've not mixed anything up :)

That's one way of thinking about it. Another is people arn't spending it because they (possibly) overvalue it and think it'll be worth more in the future, so they won't spend it on everyday things.
One example would be bitcoinstore which isn't turning over enough to be able to offer prices which are competitive with the bigger players in the market. They sell consumer electronics which, if anything, should attract custom from those who like bitcoin. Yet it's the 31st of march and they've made it half way to the turnover to get the competitive wholesale prices they need. On the other hand.. it actually sold $400k+ of goods - that's pretty good..
Either way.. there's a long way to go, and purely hoarding isn't going to help that right now.

Just had a quick scan through, I believe you need to use the --web bit, and it'll give you a form to fill in.
To be honest, I'd probably go with the new wallet option, rather than trusting code someone else wrote, although it does appear to be genuine. Just make sure you keep a back up of your original wallet far away from anything else you're doing (I'd put it on a USB key or something).

So we need to pool all of the pools for a safer pool?
@_date: 2013-04-03 16:15:44
Depends which client or online wallet you're using, but the default for bitcoin-qt is 0.0005. You can change this in options though. It'll only prompt you to pay the tx fee if your transaction doesn't meet the priority criteria ([more info here]( If your 1 BTC was fairly "old" (i.e. many confirmations on the majority of input) then you'd have a higher priority than the threshold (57,600,000) and it'll allow you send it for free.
The downside is that the choice of rejecting/accepting a transaction into their block is up to the miners. Further, free transactions spread across the network more slowly than those with a fee - again see the link I gave earlier.
Essentially, if you want a transaction to complete within an hour (roughly 6 blocks), then you should pay the fee. If there's no hurry, then it'll get there eventually without.
Hope that explains it for you :)

Might help your arguement to address him rather than refer to some shadowy "Mr BTCGuild" that's all :)
He's very aware of the issue, and he's taken steps to reduce the pool's share.
The fact is that he was one of the first to provide a stable platform for ASICs to mine, and was also very quick (and/or lucky enough) to help out with the blockchain fork a few weeks ago - this attracted a lot of miners to move (back)to BTCGuild. The PPLNS system is also very attractive with some pretty competitive fees. Essentially he's got people asking for him punished for running a particularly good pool. If the other pool operators stepped their game up, then it'd help diversify the share.
Also, the tools are there for miners to check if they are mining for a rogue pool operator. It shouldn't be down to the pool owner to do *all* of the work - the miners themselves are just as responsible.
Personally, I've moved my the majority of my hashrate to Slush's pool, but that's not exactly a small pool either.
@_date: 2013-04-06 08:51:03
Once it was slush, then deepbit, then btcguild, next it'll be 50btc.. etc etc. With the difficulty rises people want to eliminate the reward variance for mining, so they'll always end up heading for the larger pools.
You don't really propose a solution other than to wait for more confirmations, which just means transactions take longer, for 25 you're talking a wait of 8 hours...

Look up brain wallets.
As NeuxSaed mentioned - it's a terrible idea because you make your private key far more vulnerable when using a memorable passphrase.
You could use random words (without correct grammar) then use a hash on those words, then use the result of the hash as passphrase.. that should avoid the danger of someone just looking for brain wallets with passphrases of dictionary words.
That's more security through obscurity.. but it adds an extra layer I suppose :)

Have sold on localbitcoins and it was pretty smooth.
If you've got online banking you just give your sort code/account number (I use a basic throwaway account and transfer it elsewhere instantly) and you it'll usually show up within minutes. The escrow service charges a 1% fee, which is fairly reasonable.

It's the propagation to the mining pools which is important though, if it takes 10 minutes to be picked up by the majority of hashing power then it could take 10+ minutes to make it into a block (as happened here).

The delay on confirmations in the bitcoin network are what kills this. If you spot a huge difference between exchanges, it has usually gone in the time it takes (average 60 mins) to get 6 confirms when transferring the BTC across exchanges... this can still be a problem for exchanges which only want 3 confirms.. especially if the network suddenly has some bad luck.
This is a huge weakness of bitcoin for this kind of thing.

Each address is a public key associated with a private key, so yes.


This is only for bitcoin-qt (AFAIK, you'd have to check if you use a different client): You only use addresses in your pool of 100 when you spend coins. If you created a paper wallet associated with a single address which you only pay money into, then your coins won't go anywhere.
If you wanted to spend any coins in your paper wallet, you should import the private key from it, spend the coins, then create a new paper wallet address and send them there, or alternatively send the remaining "change" to the original paper wallet address. Creating a new paper wallet is "safer", not to say sending them to the original unsafe.

Well actually, roads benefit the majority of people because they provide a useful service for transport. You'd be hard pressed to find a person who doesn't benefit from public roads. I'm sure there'd be the odd person who is entirely self-sufficient and lives in the woods, but that person probably doesn't pay taxes or make use of the services those taxes would pay for.
However, if you want to take part in society, you do need at least some of the services that taxes pay for, so you should pay taxes for those which benefit you. That leads me back to the administration problem described above, so it's more efficient to lump it together and be fairly sure it'll average out.
I'm guessing your attitude is that if you just removed taxes and let private bodies administer their own patches that you'd end up with the same thing and infrastructure would be taken care of.. Remove the police force and regulation and then I'd have to ask what would happen to those who attempted to use those privately owned services without paying for them?

This one could do a bit of damage: 
~~Those Tesla cards can do about 800MH/s each.~~
Apparently they can only do about 150 each, which would be around 2-3TH/s so it wouldn't even get close to being capable. Even using the cpus, you'd still only get another 1TH/s max (assuming using all 16 cores on each of the 18,688 available, and getting ~4MH/s on each.. which is probably pushing it even with the best CPU miners).
So.. no, I don't think it's possible. The only viable attack would be to take over multiple pools at the moment. Most pool operators are very aware of not nearing the 50% mark as well.

I think you'd be surprised how quickly it falls apart. Local councils are very similar in style and very few people give a shit about those.
Direct democracy requires that the majority of people take an active interest in politics and policy. Given that we struggle to get turnouts of over 60% for general elections, and I think a recent vote had a turnout below 25%.. this isn't going to happen anytime soon.
As I've said, the problem is the general population not giving a shit.. basically because their lives are comfortable and they have no reason to take an interest.

Also, escrow doesn't really help with quick transactions.. for example - you want to return a product. Laws in my country say that you get 14 days to return for online/distance purchases. With a credit card, it's very simple to get your money back if the seller doesn't play ball.

The change isn't going to your sending address by chance.. or at all, you're obviously using the same client to do the transactions and not actually seeing that your paper wallet address is empty. Search for your paper wallet address on blockchain.info - it'll most likely be empty.

In your current (secure) wallet, grab an address you want to transfer to (new or old, up to you).
Create a new wallet (temporary.. can delete once you're done), import the private key of the compromised address to that new wallet, send the whole balance to your secure address, don't include a fee and wait.
If you want to be more sure, include a small fee (say 1 satoshi), although the zero fee transaction will eventually make it.. it just might take a day or 2.
I don't see why you need to bother putting any more in, but you could also import an additional private key into the new (temporary) wallet which contains a larger amount of BTC (say 1BTC) and then move the entire balance (would be 1.00027 BTC) to the secure address.. again include a fee if you want to be sure... etc.
Note that the 1BTC I used here would be in the same temporary wallet as your compromised address, but it wouldn't be in the compromised address with the 0.00027, so the guy who stole your BTC wouldn't have access to it.

Fantastic in theory, but it just doesn't work on larger scales. For example, it'd work in a small village/town where most people know each other. However it'd fall on it's face in a large city. I know maybe 3 people on my street of ~150 houses in a fairly large city, no one is interested in knowing each other - we're all just separate entities who have nothing to do with each other.
Community spirit just isn't going to happen here because the residents change too often through a combination of students and short-term rents.
On your comments about democracy: yeah it's not perfect, but it's better than any other system we've had before. The way to make democracy work is to actually hold your local representative to order - actively engage with them, attend their surgeries and get involved. People don't do this and they end up with exactly what they deserve.
You don't need to devolve the government to get what you're asking for, you need the local people to actively engage with the people they elected. Far too many don't do this.

I agree, bitcoin has faults and we shouldn't be scared to talk about them. I see it as a paypal alternative for international payments, especially when you and the other party don't share a common local currency. I don't see any need for bitcoin for transactions which are being made within the same locality. In this scenario the time to wait for confirmation isn't really a problem - it's not like going into a shop and buying something.

Think I read about it at the same time on slashdot then again around the time of the pizza purchase! Most people seemed to dismiss it and mock it. I pretty much dismissed it because of that then came back to it in April/May 2011 and decided to give mining a go, then it immediately spiked up and crashed within a month or so.
Was quite exciting and I left my miners going over the whole summer and switched most of them off around October as things seemed to cool down and get boring with the price getting lower and more stagnant. Wish I'd left them going now! I'd be rich! I did keep all the coins I mined (only 10 or so) and sold most of them as the price rose recently. I've kept 2.5 and am still mining a bit on a few AMD cards I happened to have.

Fundamentally, yes. Realistically it will always require third party services - those services will add their fees and you end up with the same scenario.

The variance you experience when mining for a pool with less than 10% is pretty high though.. sure you gain sometimes, but you can easily get a huge dip in your rewards.. if this happens with a large difficulty increase in the middle then you can lose out a fair amount (e.g. Slush had about 60% luck in the day or so before the change of difficulty yesterday.. not a very good time for it to happen).
P2Ppool is a good idea, but atm it needs a bit of work to catch up with the others, IMO.
To decrease the incentive to pool you'd have to make the reward smaller or more frequent (i.e. more blocks than 1 per 10 minutes), or implement a PPS-style payout into the reward system for a block. This doesn't really work with the decreasing reward over time or the idea of transaction fees. Also, the number of stale shares would be huge compared to a mining pool since you'd be submitting shares to the whole bitcoin network, meaning latency would be a big deal.

Alternatively, cash out the GBP price from the BTC - keep the rest and hold.. win-win ?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:01:22
The price is irrelevant as long as it remains stable. To remain stable you need sufficient market depth. The reason for the wild price swings is partly due to the lack of depth.
I'd postulate the lack of depth is due to the lack of adoption as a means of transaction - not enough people are selling goods in exchange for bitcoin. The reason for this, IMO, is that the real use for bitcoin is at an international level - if I can pay you with a free bank transfer within our own country, I don't need to use bitcoin.

Sorry dude, you don't get to just redefine things to suit your arguments.
Fundamentally, your problem is with taxation because you don't agree with the principle - that's fine and you are free to argue your reasons for that. However, trying to manipulate people into taking your point of view by using emotive language like "theft" and "stealing" isn't fine and when someone tries to bring this kind of manipulation into a discussion, I immediately lower my opinion of them and am far less likely to take them seriously.

You're right though, plenty of other people in countries outside of the US and Europe are standing up for themselves, although it's happening in countries without particularly stable government or with a history of military coups.

I'm pretty sure this is nothing to do with BTC and if it is at all, it's most likely to do with high numbers of transactions via SEPA/otherwise to overseas accounts which are unknown.
That fits the profile of a risky customer as far as a bank is concerned. They don't care if he's buying/selling BTC or goods, it just puts him in a risky category. The departments who are dealing with this kind of thing are much like insurance companies. They don't care about you as an individual, it's about the stats from the data they hold (and Lloyds TSB hold a lot of data). On top of that, he seemed to suggst he was just using the account as a passthrough anyway, so the bank isn't holding large deposits for any period of time and isn't being used like the "average" account (i.e. receives his paycheck, pays bills, etc). He simply isn't making them any money since he isn't storing deposits with them for any large amounts of time, so they don't want him as a customer. That's their right, tbh.
The bank itself is part-owned by the government because the bank was close to collapse after they bought HBOS during the 2008 crisis. They are under a lot of pressure to turn a profit.

You're wrong. It doesn't work like that.
If I put an ask on mtgox for 0.1 BTC @ $1 then I'll sell my 0.1BTC for whatever the highest bids (equal to or greater than $1) are.
So say the highest bid is $150 for 0.04 BTC. My ask will fill that and I'll get 6$ and that person will get 0.04. If the next highest bid is $149.5 for 0.07 BTC, I'll get $8.97 and they'll get 0.06 BTC. At this point I have no more coins to sell at the ask I set. The person with a bid at $149.5 will now be bidding for 0.01 BTC (as I filled up 0.06 of their bid).
Make sense?

I understand, and the utility is definitely there.
What's missing is the widespread acceptance of them at a retail level and I've seen only a little improvement in that since I first owned a bitcoin with the exception of bitcoinstore... the next year or so is very important in that regard :)
However, what I question is how many people will stick around long enough to find out if it works. I suppose that's the risk!

Free hardware - a mac pro with a 5870 in it, part of a research grant. Mining running at low intensity while being used.
Free power - solar generated.
Also did mine a little on another office machine (not solar powered) with an nvidia card which was typically left running CFD simulations overnight anyway, the gpu wasn't in use anyway.
I'd say that is fairly efficient use of resources :)
@_date: 2013-04-03 12:20:06


Because people are making huge profits off it.. in their respective currency - not in bitcoins. The fact that the dollar price is such a big deal shows how tied it is to speculation and the idea of "free money". It'll come crashing down eventually.
Yes I have bitcoins, yes I've sold periodically over the past month, yes I've made a HUGE profit after mining them in 2011 (and still have some going right now). I'm still taking the money in my currency though, I'm not dumb enough to leave it all in BTC. I've covered my electricity costs and then some with what I've sold, so what I've got left is just a little gamble as far as I'm concerned. There is still no means for me to buy anything useful to me apart from other currencies with bitcoin. This is 2 years on...

That's a very fair point, although I suspect the OP wants to get an idea of how many unique people (or at least unique IPs) are using bitcoin over time.. probably to gauge how popular it actually is.
Obviously people using things like blockchain.info makes this a fuzzy estimate, but it would be interesting to know, especially as the chart he linked to seems to suggest a downward trend - although that could easily be because people arn't keeping their clients open for long.

Honestly though, if you're going to CPU mine you're just going to throw money away on electricity - it's not feasible anymore. You need an a GPU (AMD/ATI) at worst. You'd do better to buy $100's worth.. even if they halved in value you'd still have done better than trying to mine the same amount on a cpu.

The comment I'd originally replied to said that bitcoin means you pay less in fees.
As you say, there's always built-in fees and they're pretty much impossible to avoid. You pay fees even when paying in cash - someone has to handle the money, count it, pay it into a bank etc. Their labour has to be paid, etc. Most large companies would prefer that customers use debit/credit cards because it costs them less to process than cash.
Bitpay charges ~1% afaik.. which is on par with a credit card (possibly slightly more, actually) last time I checked.
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:18:14
Might be a bit late, but you can import the private key into another client, such as bitcoin-qt then resend the transaction and include the appropriate fee. It'll create a double spend, but theoretically the fee-paying transaction should be accepted by a block a lot quicker than the fee-less one.
Here's how you would import the key for bitcoin-qt: 
You can launch the client as normal then click help -&gt; debug window -&gt; console, and type the commands in there.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:57:01
You probably didn't pay a transaction fee so it hasn't been included in a block yet. Nothing to do with mtgox.

I wasn't saying that Steam wouldn't be huge for bitcoin - it definitely would be. I was refuting the idea that Valve(or anyone else) needs to save linux. I've run games on linux since 2002 or so.. Unreal Tournament, for example, ran very smoothly. My recent experiences with linux drivers from both amd and nvidia have been fairly positive. Steam coming to linux is definitely a good thing, but I don't see it as some kind of huge awakening.
BTW, I actually think the use of GPUs in parallel implementations and for supercomputers is more important to linux/unix in some ways, that has certainly helped boost driver support.

Because at your hash rate (&lt;1GH/s) you won't be causing any communication delay or flooding the server at difficulty 1. If you had, say, 20GH/s, you'd be submitting shares a lot more frequently at difficulty 1 which floods the server and can cause delays (more chance of stale shares, missing the end of a pool's round, etc), so it makes sense to slow your share submissions while increasing their value.

Completely agree. All the speculation makes it incredibly unattractive as a transaction medium.
I view bitcoin as a paypal competitor which could completely dominant the online payment market. I know others think it was created for other reasons, but I really think this is it's most important use.

If the wallet is encrypted you'll need to unlock the wallet by typing:
walletpassphrase PASSWORDHERE 120
where PASSWORDHERE is the password and 120 is the number of seconds it'll unlock the wallet for (120 secs is plenty), once you're done, type walletlock.

That's quite strange that it says "account"="YPT". Which version are you running?
Usually this means you've got the address labelled in bitcoin-qt. Have you tried loading the recovered_wallet.dat which pywallet found?
Also, keep a backup of the wallet.dat (obviously).. try launching bitcoin-qt from the command line (think you said you're using OS X, I think these work for that too) with "bitcoin-qt -upgradewallet" then checking the validateaddress command again.
If that doesn't help, try "bitcoin-qt -salvagewallet"
Again, you could do all these with bitcoind as well (qt being the GUI front end).
Repeat these on the recovered_wallet.dat you got from pywallet too. (rename original wallet to original_wallet.dat, then copy/rename recovered_wallet.dat to wallet.dat and put in the .bitcoin folder)
@_date: 2013-05-13 00:13:01
Sure, but we're talking &lt;10BTC here.. that's "spending money" IMO.
I guess the attitude should be.. the kind of money you keep in your current account goes in your online wallet (maybe just encrypted with a strong password and/or on a standalone linux partition) and the kind of money you'd keep in your savings account should go onto the offline machine or into a paper wallet (I personally think paper wallets are stupid.. but that's just me).
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:06:42
Very fair point :)
@_date: 2013-04-07 15:53:58
It's probably in the pool of 100 hidden address in the wallet.
Try creating a few new addresses in bitcoin-qt with that wallet loaded, do any of them match?
Alternatively, you could use the debug console (or bitcoind at command line): click help -&gt; debug window -&gt; console.
type "validateaddress 1HG6A4fCnVEKR25T9GgVxH9vVyTv5eLn87"










This is the output when I do it. If it belongs to that wallet, the "ismine" will read true.
EDIT: If you find that it is in the wallet, you could export the private key and then he could create a new wallet and import it to that wallet,
type "dumpprivkey 1HG6A4fCnVEKR25T9GgVxH9vVyTv5eLn87" in the console, and "importprivkey &lt;whatever the output was&gt;" in the console for the new wallet.

1. Example: online music piracy. If it's easy to bypass payment with little chance of repercussion then people will do, even with the wild threats coming from the "owners" of that music. On top of this, a general business does have a threat - it is essentially that they will turn you over to the policing authority if you cheat them.
2. Let's look at your sunkist example then: Suppose instead of being in a store for you to purchase, it was just lying in the middle of the street with no one looking at it, possibly with a sign saying "please put $x in box over there" - you think the seller is going to make a profit on those cans? 
Now replace that stack of sunkist cans with the entire road network which, on average, isn't being watched. People can only use that road if they've paid. You actually think people will actually pay?

Jeez, if theyre on a drive you've put in someone else's machine you're probably out of luck, although the wallet.dat is a tiny file so you never know :/
The testdisk utility is probs your best bet - it'll search for old/overwritten partitions on the drive and should give you the option to spit out the data to another place (external drive for example).
Someone else also mentioned a prog which will search a drive looking for the signature of a wallet.dat and pull it out - essentially you just point it at a drive and let it go.. I've never used it though so I can't say for sure if it works. You could probably write your own though, it wouldn't be that difficult, but it'd probably end up being very slow!

On it being smaller than CCs, etc - not true in the slightest. I pay zero fee on the majority of credit or debit card transactions. It beats paypal in most cases. If you want to send a very small amount though, the fee can be a large percentage.


They come as fast as the next few blocks mined (assuming your transaction makes it quickly to the miners). The network is designed to create 1 block per 10 minutes, so 6 confirmations (considered a safe number) should take, on average, 60 minutes.

It doesn't defeat the purpose, writing it down isn't the problem. The point was that a dictionary(with grammar included) attack is far more feasible than one without grammar included. By including a customised hash sequence you'd eliminate a dictionary attack entirely.
These would be performed against your passphrase (so could be automated), not by someone who has found a piece of paper with the information about the passphrase.
I do think your idea is sufficient at the moment, but with improvements in hardware it becomes less so and with increasing value of what's inside the wallet it becomes more worthwhile.

A bit of advice:
You need to separate bitcoin and gambling in your head. Bitcoin is actually nothing to do with this. It was all to do with gambling. It isn't much different from you taking your money to a casino and gambling it all on roulette (although at least satoshidice is technically "fair" compared to a casino).

There's been very little evidence of a DDOS today.. the lag appears to be down to the amount of people using the exchange.
This is what an unregulated market looks like. Gox make about 1% on every trade - the spot price doesn't really matter - so why should they care?
The actual problem is people panic selling like sheep at the first sniff of a dump. If people were actually confident in bitcoin, they would buy up the coins that are being dumped. This is a problem of human psychology, not something for Gox to deal with.
@_date: 2013-03-31 01:40:25
Just to reiterate what others have said:
If you feel that you can afford to lose what you've spent on bitcoins so far: great, carry on. Imagine you wake up tomororw and the value has dropped to $1 - nothing you can do about it, would it be catastrophic? If yes, invest some of it in something else.
In terms of what to do with your bitcoins, spend them on things you'd otherwise spend your usual cash on, especially if you can get a discount. Like coffee? see if you can buy beans using bitcoins (something I wanted to do when I first mined bitcoins.. never managed it), Or what about some new computer hardware? - see if you can buy it in BTC.. etc. That is using them for what they were intended (IMO, maybe you think otherwise).

I imagine the majority are created by people who have sent a zero fee transaction that isn't being confirmed by the network for a long period. You can manually import the private key to another wallet and attempt to resend the balance and add a fee, this sometimes forces it through quicker.
I attempted it yesterday myself, although my original zero-fee transaction went through just afterwards, so it ended up disappearing (deleted the wallet which was broadcasting the second attempt).
The usual reason those zero-fee transactions get stuck are a combination of a busy network and sending from an address which has a lot of inputs. For example, I sent about 1BTC which just happened to have about 20 inputs (lots of ~0.05s adding up to 1). This causes the transaction to be quite large in size, say 2kb instead of 200 bytes. This is a very unattractive transaction to a miner because it takes lots of space, so without a fee it gets ignored for a lot longer than normal.

Pretty sure they do when you sell it for a profit.
For example, in the UK a quick google reveals you would pay capital gains tax on any profit above £10,100 in a single financial year.
Another quick google reveals that you have to pay 28% capital gains on gold in the USA.

I agree to some extent, I'm just wondering what will happen when the gains stop and people who only got into it for the profit start to lose interest. I suspect it'll cause a slow sliding crash (much like we saw from $30 to ~$5 back in 2011).

Don't leave your funds in a wallet/address you are not completely in control of. It's that simple, leaving anything in an exchange for a long period of time isn't particularly wise.
Either set up a local wallet on your computer, encrypt it with a strong password and back it up, or if you're extra paranoid create an offline/cold wallet which you don't put anywhere near the internet except for when you move funds.

Point 4 being rough: I'd replace "no one" with a larger (as in larger than the minority in point 3) minority.
That larger minority would have a negative impact on everyone else which is substantial enough to warrant the threat of imprisonment. In a wonderful utopian society it wouldn't be necessary, but we clearly don't live in that world.
1. What? - The successful ones operate within the laws and turn a profit.. not sure what you're getting at, sorry.
2. The policing to stop those who have not paid for those services would cost a ridiculous amount and be detrimental to those services. The cost of policing within the laws set is already a large burden, to introduce another layer of administration would be lunacy.

Firstly, this confirms to me that your wallet.dat was stolen. Either in an unencrypted form (from memory when you unlocked it, probably just before sending funds) or in an encrypted form and they managed to get your password (I think bruteforcing is ruled out because of the timeframe). This may help you work out when your wallet was stolen:
If you give me a copy of your wallet, then straight after you make a transaction from your own client with that wallet, your change will go to address X.
If, some time later, I load up your wallet into my client and make a transaction, the change will also go to address X.
This is because address X is the next available address in the wallet. If you make a copy of the wallet, it freezes that change address in time.
So you now know that your wallet was stolen between this transaction: 
and this transaction (EDIT: actually, I think it's more like the april 26th transaction.. I first assumed that this was you grouping funds, but I think I'm wrong): 
[EDIT: You could use the litecoin transactions to narrow it down too if there is any change address to look at there.]
Maybe this helps you a lot more with looking at logs?
Personally, I think this coinbomb thing had something to do with it, but I've not got any knowledge of what it is.
EDIT: Noticed this post too:

2x5850 mining means about 300W extra power usage(assuming you PC was switched on and idle otherwise, more if you'd have turned the PC off), so for ever hour you mine you're paying about 0.3*(your rate) extra.

Hope you wrote down the number plate.. just report him to the police for fraud. Don't even have to mention bitcoin *initially*, just say you met with him to sell something and he took your money and ran without you getting the item.
*EDIT*: since multiple people are pointing it out.. Obviously you need to mention that the defrauded item was bitcoin.. but the point is that someone ran off with your money without providing the agreed goods. It could've been any collectible item.

I'm not contradicting myself, that is the basis of a democratically elected government. You don't have full say in what goes on as an individual, you have a tiny percentage of a say in what goes on and sometimes what you're saying isn't the loudest. If you live in a democratic country, you are free to leave if you don't like it. If you choose to stay then you implicitly agree to stay under the laws set out by "everyone".. that "everyone" is the government.
Ok, so who is actually doing the stealing when it comes to taxes?
Is it the head of that government? Is Obama personally stealing from every US citizen who plays tax? Or is it a group of people.. maybe just the president, vice president, secretary of defense, etc - just the ones who head their departments. Or maybe it's even larger group... maybe it's actually everyone who pays their taxes - they're the ones stealing from you.. and themselves? who knows - I don't think you do.
At the crux of this is that paying your taxes is your "rent" to the state for the services they provide you. If you're not happy with those services you're free to leave or attempt to sway public opinion in order to change things. However, your attempt at manipulating public opinion with your emotive claims is dishonest. Although you're free to do it just as anyone else is free to tell you that you're wrong.

I remember the ufasoft cpu miner was being picked up as malware by virus scanners because of this botnet. They also cause a fair amount of annoyance to mining pool operators.
I doubt that the owner of this botnet wants to crash the price of BTC - this is earning them some pretty big money, they are more likely responsible for the large dips we've seen recently though.. cashing out, etc.

Can answer here if you want too...
How I first got bitcoins: I mined them on CPU/GPUs (very slowly using an nvidia GPU and also some on an ATI card) in 2011, then stopped after I had around 5BTC and basically forgot about them. I then saw the price shoot up this year and decided to have a look at my old wallet and found my 5 BTC! Since then I've sold a couple using localbitcoins.com and on mtgox, but kept a few too.
Any other questions?
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:25:37
Good for you, but a month ago you could've bought that 0.02 BTC for less than a dollar. Even now you could buy those 0.02 for less than $5. Think about how many minutes/hours you've spent in order to get those "free" bitcoins.. is it possible you could've earned $5 in a shorter time period and just bought the BTC?
@_date: 2013-04-08 02:20:59
I'd have thought the new wallet in bitcoin-qt would've been quicker, but I think you'll recover them either way ;)
@_date: 2013-05-13 07:57:13
Exchanges like mt gox match a buyer to a seller.
You place an ask price (for x coins) and a buyer places a bid price (for y coins), if the bid is greater than or equal to the ask, then you sell to that person.
If x &gt; y then they get y coins and you have (x-y) left to sell to another bidder.
If y &gt; x then they get x coins and have (y-x) left to buy from another seller.
The exchange acts as a trusted escrow in a way. They hold the coins you're selling and sends them to the buyer while sending you the buyer's money.
So what happens to your bitcoins?
You -&gt; exchange -&gt; Buyer
The balances are moved in the blockchain just like any other bitcoin transaction. If you sell to multiple people, then your coins are split amongst them as sold on the exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-07 22:52:45
I didn't say I feel I should voluntarily give everything I have to the government. I just mean that when you profit from something, you should give something back to society, which taxation is a means of doing. It may not be the most efficient means available, but then it's difficult to determine what is.
You may not have noticed, but bitcoin is nothing more than a protocol. It doesn't follow any set political message or ideology.
I can be a bitcoin supporter without being an anarchist, without being a libertarian, or being anything else for that matter. Just as I can believe in social healthcare without being a communist.
I believe that the potential of bitcoin as a means of financial transaction is a very good one, that's why I like it, and I hope one day I'll be able to use it to buy things from anywhere in the world just like I would use my credit card to buy something from amazon today.
@_date: 2013-06-03 19:13:00

The best hashrates are on ATI/AMD graphics cards (the more shaders the better). CPU mining will cost you far more in electricity than you'll get back - I really wouldn't recommend it unless you don't pay for the electrity used.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:55:23
Ah good, bit of faith restored :)
As you explain - the 2 (or more) bots essentially buying and selling back and forth is what causes the perception of a price drop even though a very small amount has actually changed hands.
Some would argue that this actually lowers volatility because the trades happen without emotion attached and so the true price is reached quicker and with less chance of a panic occuring. On larger price differentials though, I think it can really panic people who are watching :/

I know, it's slightly dishonest to use extremes. The failure of Somalia's government is fairly complex. It was actually to point more obviously to the rhetorical question.

I suspect the answer goes a lot further than "anarchy is better than socialism".
@_date: 2013-04-08 00:06:38
You're clearly someone who is actively seeking to achieve that goal. The problem is that the majority of people are not (although they do want it). Taxation is the one size fits all answer to that problem. On a small scale your ideas may work, but the problem is that not everyone is like you.
Most people are happy to settle for the easy life.
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:04:19
Good luck selling $500,000 worth of btc for cash.. I wasn't talking about small amounts - they're not taxable anyway, unless you do so many that it puts you over the capital gains threshold.
Also, as soon as you can link a real world transaction to an address you can theoretically trace every single person who has interacted with that address. Suppose you sold a large sum of BTC in cash with the intention of evading taxation. The person you sold it to may wish to declare that transaction at a later date should they be liable for capital gains tax. It's now possible to identify you because that person can connect you to that address. Your anonymity is as strong as those you interact with. 
The blockchain is pseudoanonymous and every single bitcoin can be traced back to origin given enough time and effort. A mixing service can make it not worth the time/effort, but I'd imagine that running a mixing service will eventually be equated to money laundering (which is is certainly used for when coins are stolen).

The reason you have to pay, rather than it being voluntary, is that a lot (or at least enough) people wouldn't pay otherwise.
If you disagree with the government's actions then stand yourself or vote and campaign for someone else. The reality is that most people don't actually are, even if they moan about it they don't do anything proactive to change it.

I'm not actually saying that you should leave your country because you don't like the system of government, but you certainly benefit from that system while living there. I really would love to see a country where your ideologies could be tested, but unfortunately the closest I could think of is Somalia - hence the joke.
BTW, The [original bitcoin paper]( read the first page if you want) sets it out purely as a transaction medium, suggesting that it was created with this in mind, rather than to overcome fiat currency/government.
@_date: 2013-05-01 23:21:50
Do you mean 1BTC or 1 block per 6 months?
Mining at about 500MH/s should get you 1 BTC over 6 months, although the difficulty jump with ASICs being added (and added fast if BFL really are delivering.. which seems like it is actually happening) may mean you need more. Right now you can pick up a 7950 which can manage this for around $300. Dunno if that meets your definition of cheap.
You'll probably find that the electricity cost is too much to make it worth it though.
The short answer is "probably not".
@_date: 2013-04-06 17:56:54
The incentive to save (edit: bitcoins right now) is based on the idea of having more (edit: of your local currency) in the future - essentially greed. If anything, this links heavily to a consumerism-based world.
Worse, the reluctance to spend reduces liquidity, which slows things down and can cause wild swings in price - not very useful for a currency where you may wish to purchase basics such as food or energy (heating, etc) with.
The reason for the economic downturn and rising cost of things at the moment is due to a reluctance to spend, and ironically was caused by the will to overspend. Essentially, there is a fine balance and going too far either way leaves you at a loss.
@_date: 2013-07-08 13:30:17
Completely agree with you. I know quite a few people who work in various bits of Lloyds TSB (who OP confirmed was the bank) and they're quite aggressively trying to reduce their risk profile and shift customers off their books. The failed Co-op/Verdi merger has a fair bit to do with this, although they'd probably have had to do it anyway.
Basically, nothing to do with bitcoin - it's just a coincidence. Further, OP is likely a "risky" customer as far as Lloyds are concerned.

When you encrypt your wallet it creates a new pool of background address which is where new receiving addresses and change address are taken from. If you've done a transaction where you've sent to a newer receiving address than you had in the unencrypted wallet or where the change from the send would come back to you - your old wallet will have not have those addresses.
If you haven't moved any coins after encrypting the wallet then you could try launching bitcoin with "bitcoin-qt -rescan". It sounds like you've moved coins since encrypting though, so you're gonna have to remember that password.
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:46:52
If you're going to game on it, go for the 7950 - it's a fantastic card.. the only problem is that the cpu/mobo I'd go for with a dedicated mining rig would be vastly different to what I'd choose for gaming.
The way I see it, if you're going to build a gaming machine anyway - just spec it up as you want.. when you're not gaming, disable as much of the power draw as possible(if you care about power use), and mine. In this scenario you're practically taking zero risk because the BTC mined is just a bonus on what is otherwise a nice gaming machine anyway.

I sold some coins there just before the price started crashing (didn't quite catch the top, but I was happy). It was very quick and easy. I haven't tried to sell any since though, so it's possible that the interest has waned an awful lot since then!
I guess it really depends on your area/country. For example, bank transfers are free within my country so I can sell to a lot more people than just my own local area and don't have to physically meet them - I can simply use online banking to confirm the transfer.

Honestly, I think it is a viable transfer medium, and so I guess that makes it a viable currency. I have always viewed it as a paypal alternative if you like, it can provide a very similar service, but with a fraction of the fees. This would be hugely liberating for buyers and sellers alike, IMO. That's always been my view on bitcoin and this view of it as a store of wealth doesn't sit well with me - people don't carry out everyday transactions in gold do they?
In terms of what I want the "price" to do.. I just want it to be stable. If that means it's $100 per 1BTC, that's fine. If it's $1000... $50.. $10.. whatever, that's fine although I will concede that a high price means the price is less open to manipulation by wealthy individuals. Just as long as it provides a means for small-medium businesses (or your typical ebay seller) to accept it on a wider scale without having to resort to using a payment processor (removing the price fluctuation risk) who end up acting as paypal do now.
The increase in price is natural - when the reward halved from 50 to 25, that really cut the supply, which pushes the price up. However the majority of the price increase (and so the increase in demand) has been fuelled by speculators, IMO.

Blaming obesity on the NHS.. mkay. The US has even higher obesity rates where private healthcare dominates.. so that's that one done. Oh and it's responsible for inflation now too! Oh wait that happened in the US too. And.... my dad's obese.. well I can't compare that to the private healthcare, but he didn't need to be treated for anything related to obesity, but nice try.
Research being purely funded by the private sector is a bad thing, it'll go for what is profitable, not necessarily what is needed to help people. A balance between the two is a good thing.
Exxon Mobil arn't even in the top 10, neither are Shell. Wal-Mart is though.. although I somehow doubt they provide a lot of research funding for healthcare.

I honestly don't know if there's provision for that in UK tax law.. you could equally pay me in meat, shares in the company, or beer. I'd guess that I wouldn't be liable for incoming tax because it's not legally defined as income.
You might find yourself in trouble for national insurance contributions or possibly minimum wage laws.
However, let's assume that's not a problem.. I'd then take my BTC and find that I'd have to pay my electricity bill. I'd have to sell BTC for GBP in order to pay it. If I don't gain more than £10k a year from selling BTC (or other assets included under capital gains), I guess I technically wouldn't have to pay tax on it. Thus I'd only be paying VAT on the electricity bill.
Having said that, if I'm earning under £10k a year I wouldn't be paying income tax anyway (think that's the latest threshold.. may be slightly lower). I guess I'd not be paying national insurance contributions (which is technically a tax), although I'd also not be contributing towards my state pension either.
To pre-empt your next question. If the electricity company decided to accept BTC, I think we'd be at a point where tax law would be changed to include BTC directly.

If you pay in cash you're factoring in the cost of handling that money. If you accept bitcoin you'll factor in the risk of the exchange rate changing or the effort of converting it into your local currency.
I wasn't saying everyone is out to rip everyone else off and 1 confirmation is completely fine in most situations.. that can still take over 10 minutes to happen. Accepting zero-confirmation transactions is a little riskier and more open to exploitation - something you'd have to factor into the price you charge.

I don't think you quite understand what I'm saying.


That's the whole point.

Nice idea, but it's not far off trying to get amazon to accept them, especially as they've got Steam wallet on the go. Still.. worth a try :)
The thing is, valve already has methods of payment for the major markets in the world. Why would they be interested in something which is still finding it's feet and is varying by 10% vs the usual currencies they accept during a day?
Also, you typoed:


I'm not pointing that out to be pedantic, but that when requesting something, it's a good idea to come across as "professional".
Having said all that, I'm interested to see if you get a reply :)

So.. is that a yes? - I'd love to know how that pans out for you long term!

I have no incentive to search for the law, I don't live in the US. Just like you have no incentive to test your claim about the law because you don't pay income tax.

If you've already got the solar power though.. may as well use the free electricity. My parents have an installation so I set up a miner to mine in daylight hours (roughly 6am-6pm) on my dad's mac pro (5870). Worked very nicely until he started moaning about the fan noise lol
