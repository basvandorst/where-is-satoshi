Hey genius why does your website say there are 232 countries (on your statistics page) When there are officially only 195 countries on the world?  Can Mr. Captain of Industry please provide a list of the missing countires?

Can you point me to just in this quote where he is explicitly illustrating his lack of knowledge of prices?  Can you illustrate to me how prices DO work?  Please spare me a supply and demand curve from a Econ 101 class.  I'm more looking for an Econ 501 explanation.  You do know that if bitcoin is regulated there is MORE money to be made right?  You understand what false demand and artificial ceilings and price floors are right?

Hey genius.  No social phenomena makes exponential gains. None.  NONE ever.  If year 10 is 4 billion people adoption year 11 is 8 billion.  By year 12 we have 16 billion people using bitcoin.  That is more than what is estimated to be on the planet by that point.  Mind you the majority of people aren't even in the demographic to use bitcoin (ie children, the jobless, the majority of 3rd world people, people without access to the internet.)

I don't know what logical fallacy this is but thinking that "anyone who disagrees with me is just jealous" is seriously flawed thinking.  It is no different than a heroin addict stating "anyone who hasn't tried heroin shouldn't criticize it"   I've yet to have a butter rightfully explain why if the dollar and banks are so bad (and going to fail) then why put a dollar valuation (in fiat no less) on bitcoin?  If your internet funny money is so great it should (as you already claim it does) transcend the dollar.  But it doesn't.  You can't have both.

Are you going to do any explaining other than a non sequitor?

Who is to say that this won't happen with the other exchanges?  If bitcoin reaches 40,000 dollars a bitcoin.  A number so delusionally touted around here.  Which exchange will be solvent enough to fulfill orders?  You certainly cannot become solvent on fees alone.  What's worse is morons are investing in bitcoin (I should stop with that alone) with credit cards.  And no doubt those same morons are paying the minimum monthly fee on those cards without paying off the balance.  You know there is a reason actual legit exchanges aren't allowed to take credit cards as payment, and certainly most states don't allow people to use credit cards to buy lottery tickets.   And if 'fiat' were so bad.  Why is everyone so concerned about the price of bitcoin in dollars?  Let's just spend bitcoins and not worry about what the conversion rate is!  If only the world worked on tulips.
@_date: 2014-12-29 21:33:54
Professional trolls?  Do you have some evidence to back that up? What accrediting body certifies universities that provide degrees in'trolling'?  How can you distinguish the bear market from acting by trolls from acting rationally?

I'm a fan of firesales to drop the price.   massively just giving away bitcoin until the price collapses buying back and doing it again and again until a small few own a major hold and retaining bitcoin to sell at a premium.  sure fewer people will participate then but the ones who do will bear the burden of higher costs
@_date: 2014-01-19 16:26:47
I do hope they're buying tulips!
@_date: 2014-02-07 10:37:07
oh how hypocritical we are once things go wrong.   you asked for unregulated and got it and now when things go wrong someone should do something.  what makes you so certain any online exchange is different?   what most of you fools don't understand is that real exchanges have tons of regulations down to the software level so that none of these hijinks happen.   but go ahead let the 'market' decide which exchange will lose your money next.  afterall fiat is just tulips

Think about that for a minute genius.   Let's day infants and children under 12 don't own phones.   The majority of indigenous people and the majority of the poorest Africans.   And most Americans have 1 phone.   That makes those who own multiple phones own hundreds if not THOUSANDS  to bring the average down
@_date: 2014-08-09 14:33:56
So hard that people like you don't comprehend it.  If you buy 4 shares for 4 dollars at once and then sell at 10 you've netted 36 dollars.   If you dollar cost average and your average cost per share is anything between 4 and 10 you've netted less than had you just bought 4 to begin with.    Its dipshits like you who keep coming back again and again for more that's going to contribute to your own demise

How are they going to attract 500,000 a year till then?

If the app isn't meant for the vast majority of women then you still haven't answered my question. (I know that's deliberate because you don't know but you can surprise me.)  What is your HOOK.  Do you get that?  I'm not going to define it for you.  What is going to attract women to use this app and please spare me the "for the money"  Let's assume you're a pimp.  What safety precaustions do you have in place to assure the safety of your "unique" no ordinary woman?  How are you going to enforce loyalty.  How are you going to resolve monetary disputes?  What health and safety measures are going to be put in place for the people using the app?  How are you going to compete with already gray area sites like craigslist?  The market is OVER saturated with apps.  How are you going to compete with competing apps that may or may not have your "noble" business goals in mind?  Your job doing free lance coding/tech support doesn't count as a job.  Get a big boy job.

Please refrain from invoking 'natural' rights as we know those don't exist.  Unless you are willing to describe on what and or whose authority natural rights are derived from.   Thanks.

Oh Lawdy.  What you're describing is essentially a dating service.  Why would anyone pay to meet anyone when they can meet people for free?  And as you already know the majority of people on dating/meetup sites don't pay.  What is your hook to get them to pay?  How are you going to attract women.  As you KNOW dating/hookup sites average 10,000 men for every ONE woman.  Women don't need to pay to hook up and most don't require getting paid to have sex.  The monetary incentive is just not there for a woman to get paid for sex.  Why would a woman fuck an ugly man for money when she can fuck any attractive man she wants for free?  Edit: Get a job.
@_date: 2014-02-21 13:36:24
Except dollars.  Calling fiat is just a weasel word.  Dollars is backed up by force, guns, weapons, the government.  That is worth much more than fantasy, the "free" market, and gold.  Unfortunately it isn't tulips.

If bitcoin hangs on such a thin thread that a few dozen active members of a so called "troll" forum can sway confidence then maybe you need to reconsider your investment strategy.  What are you going to do IF (not when) but IF bitcoin goes mainstream?  Better hope your PR guy is getting paid.
@_date: 2014-09-09 17:23:46

No.  Calling you an incompetent businessman is an insult to incompetents.  You use the language of business but it is clear that you have no idea what it means.   That tells me either you're a swindler who is hoping to hook someone that knows less than you (which is a stretch I might add) or your a truely ignorant and believe your own hype and are desperately clutching at anything to stay relevant (another stretch)

Except they tried it unregulated prior to the creation of the fed and banking regulations and it got us into a depression.  If you think humans running a corporation are any less hapless than the humans running governments you're either a fool or ignorant.  And no matter where you are, war is what got you there.  Having the dollar supported by violence is much better than having the bitcoin supported by fantasy.

I hate to break this to you as you already knew this but all keyboards emit EMF and can be picked up by a receiver and an oscilloscope and hardware to convert the signals back to ascii.  it's funny because every idiot knows this including my friend VanEck. So this should not surprise you as this technique has been around for 40 years.   But we can't all be experts in tulips can we?

Just so you know.  Anything wireless can be intercepted, and anything that emits any frequency wireless or not can be intercepted.  Your wired keyboard has to emit unique frequencies for each key press.  That can be picked up by anyone with specialized equipment nearby.  This has been true for as long there have been computer keyboards.  Nothing ceases to amaze me about the complete and utter lack of knowledge of tech in the bitcoin world.
