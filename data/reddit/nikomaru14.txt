I can't even find the actual Weiss rating page any more. Did they take it down?
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:21:14
You're correct in that if the price does rally, it will on Monday. It won't happen over the weekend.
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:29:13
I'm honestly surprised the price has stayed this low for so long. Who the heck is selling?
@_date: 2018-01-29 06:26:28
Sell to what though? Tether? I'm staying as far away from that mess as I can. Would it be profitable to trade btc for ltc(or eth) on binance. Then move that to gdax and use it to buy more btc? 
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:47:33
There's a big difference between ethereum and all the countless shitcoins that have been popping up.
@_date: 2018-01-09 07:17:21
Market is overbought. This is just a slight correction that will last the next few days. I don't see it going any lower than 14.5k and then we will see a rally starting either this weekend or the 15th back up to or past 17k.
@_date: 2018-01-03 09:21:37
old, new? Bcash shill much?
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:50:05
Can someone who knows how to argue bcash shills plz visit
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:46:29
But what if both are right? It crashes to 1k here in February and then starts a rally toward the end of the year and hits 100k by december. Not saying it will do this but just an example.
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:52:32
Kinda unrelated but what is with all these scammers wanting iTunes gift cards? There are a ton of them on dating sites right now. Like it will seem like a real person, their pics arent on google, he or she will act very into you, you may talk for a few days or up to a week. Then all of a sudden they ask you to buy them an iTunes gift card and send them the code because they want to buy some music. 
Long story short: if someone is asking you to buy them an iTunes gift card it is most definitely a scam.
@_date: 2018-01-22 07:12:10
Haha I freaking wish it would drop that low. That way I could actually buy a whole bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:38:05
Ah too bad, most of my retirement is in Vangaurd funds. Hopefully I won't need it if this whole bitcoin thing plays out.
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:37:24
Not sure about you guys, but I am buying now because I'm confident that bitcoin will be worth a lot more sometime in the future. You can sell if you want. The only reason the price is dropping is because people are selling due to this tether story. The story was released now to drive the price of all cryptos down, when the actual subpoena happened early december.
@_date: 2018-01-18 06:38:37
The problem is that all these new people getting into crypto sign up for binance and think that they are going to be the wolf of crypto street and try to use it as a get rich quick scheme. They try and buy low and sell high and they are going to get burned. The best strategy, even for shitcoins, is to buy and hodl. Well, buy and hodl your shitcoins for as long as you can then sell before they drop off a cliff like bitconnect.
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:52:28
I believe there will be some of the better altcoins that last and prove to be useful. However I think there are just way too many right now that don't do anything new and are already way overvalued. These will fall off the chart eventually and that will be the big bubble bursting moment that everyone is predicting. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:56:37
Yep, the nicehash hack finally convinced me to buy a Trezor. And as someone who had little idea of what they were doing, I found the process of setting up my hardware wallet very easy!
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:44:42
Buys and sells are working fine but don't try to withdraw any btc to your wallet right now. Their transfers are very backlogged atm.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:44:33
US citizens can make an account on the Australian website coinspot. Transfer some btc or ltc to that account and then trade it for iota. This is how I got my iota and am very pleased. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:46:26
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:09:07
I agree with what the top comment says. Just report the gain or loss when you convert your coins back into fiat. Even for someone like me who doesn't day trade but just exchanges btc for altcoins occasionally, it's a nightmare to try and calculate your gain/loss for each individual trade. If the IRS wants that money so bad, they can calculate it themselves. 
I am no expert but I'm sure that as long as you report your gains when you sell coins back into fiat money, and pay capital gains on that, you will be fine.
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:08:28
That just sounds like a regular Saturday night to me.. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:23:42
I got in towards the end of August when bitcoin just hit an all time high of $4800. Countless people back then were saying "this is the top", "the bubble will burst soon". All I can tell you is that I regret not putting more money in back then.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:42:02
Oh gosh I can't wait for this to become a meme when the price actually hits $1 million.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:40:30
Slight chance Yes, but where will you live in the meantime?
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:46:55
Yeah there's plenty of scammers out there. I was posting on the nicehash subreddit and some guy claiming to work for nicehash asked me for my private keys.
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:50:58
I agree, I like coinbase. It's what I started out using to buy my bitcoin and I still use GDAX. I'm sure they are trying their best to make sure everything runs smoothly. If you ever need to contact their support, they will eventually help you and fix whatever is wrong, it may just take a month or two...
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:05:17
This climb is insane, we literally went up $3k in one day. Personally I'm bracing for a big correction, and then buying more ;)
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:49:26
I first bought bitcoin near the end of August when it hit a new ath just under $4800. Everyone told me that was the top, and I'll loose my money. But look at where we're at now! 
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:47:11
Always hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:51:43
Coinbase(GDAX) and Bittrex are both great exchanges. I would regimend learning how to place limit orders for GDAX though instead of buying directly from coinbase and paying their higher fees. Bittrex is great for buying Altcoins, though you cannot wire fiat money to them, you have to use Tether or Bitcoin. 
I would say to start out just stick to GDAX and buy mostly bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:05:38
I agree with you partly. I do think the IRS needs abolished, and in its place a flat tax ie everyone pays 10% income tax and that's it. No more loopholes for the extremely wealthy, no more complicated tax bs. 
Right now I have no problem paying my capital gains tax for when I trade crypto into fiat. But if the IRS thinks I'm going to calculate my gains and losses for each and every time I do a crypto to crypto trade, they are out of their minds. I refuse to do that much unnecessary calculating. I don't even day trade or anything but I have my altcoins that I like to use btc to buy and hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:41:56
I've been investing a couple hundred dollars each time I get paid and it does really add up.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:53:37
I just recently bought a Trezor as well, had no idea what I was doing, and still managed to get it set up and working correctly. Definitely would reccomend.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:46:01
Minor correction plus a little fud from Korea. Honestly if this is the "crash" everyone was worried about, I'll take it.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:30:37
YES more people should know this! They pay the transfer fee for you when you use gdax. I only learned this about a week ago. Could have been saving a ton of money in fees.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:34:05
That's why you pay your taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:39:25
Barely any of my techy friends own bitcoin let alone my non-techy friends. We are way early.
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:06:16
Are you really surprised? That's exactly what the writers of that show always do. They dumb things down to what they think is more understandable and entertaining to the average viewer. Their point in making the episode was not to inform people about bitcoin. It was to make an episode about a nerdy topic that's been making the news recently. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:51:56
Only put in what you can afford to lose. Me for instance am putting in a couple hundred dollars every time I get paid. If I lose it all oh well, I won't be living on the street or anything but it could very well multiply that money times ten in a few years.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:55:57
I bought at 16.5k thinking that was the dip. Oh well.
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:03:03
Wow people are so salty, and getting upvotes too? We're definitely at the bottom.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:06:33
Set up an account on coinbase, it's pretty straight forward.
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:20:16
That and now the only ads I get on YouTube are for Sun mining, which I have heard is a total scam.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:53:55
True, it seems somewhat stable above 16k for now. We will recover from this!
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:30:31
Ahhh so that's why my nicehash miner wasn't working... thought it was my computer. Well, I'm probably out about $100.
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:35:43
Basically certain proponents of bitcoin cash are trying to tell everyone that bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin, not bitcoin core. They say that It is better for a number of reasons and it should completely replace bitcoin and be the only bitcoin. r/btc is now being used as the main subreddit for these bitcoin cash enthusiasts.
I personally have no problem at all with bitcoin cash as a cryptocurrency. I think it will be useful in its own way compared to bitcoin. What I don't like is Roger Ver and his army of crazies trying to slander bitcoin core and convert people to bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:01:20
Dang not anymore, I get paid tomorrow and was hoping the price would stay down...
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:17:14
Use coinbase! Easiest site to start out on.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:11:36
If you're using the bitcoin.com wallet, be careful not to send Bitcoin to a bitcoin cash address and vice versa. I would recommend buying on Coinbase and getting a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger once you have a good amount.
@_date: 2018-09-09 09:57:27
Love seeing all the bears in r/bitcoinmarkets so upset from this little spike. That's a good sign. It won't take much to have another short squeeze, or at least get a lot of them to cover.
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:06:31
Yeah they are freaking out. It won't take much to get a short squeeze or at least have many of them cover. I was surprised when more shorts opened after the biggest 2-day drop in price ever. Shorts are over euphoric rn, they will pay for their greed soon.
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:09:03
Buy your altcoins with your btc on binance. The gains you will get from the trade will be minimal. Don't worry about it. Just if you ever sell any crypto for fiat, you should pay tax for your gains.
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:10:47
On gdax, they pay the transfer fee for you.
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:46:11
Transferring both fiat and crypto between gdax and coinbase is completely free. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 07:14:33
Yes, as long as you're averaging down. Buy some now, more if it drops lower.
@_date: 2018-08-15 05:49:57
6k (give or take) will just not break, no matter how much beating it takes, no matter how many people are trying to short. People keep predicting 4k but I honestly don't see it happening. Bears keep hitting the wall that is 6k.
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:41:04
Lots of good stuff on amazon.
@_date: 2018-08-28 11:31:58
Well if I had to guess, this steady uptrend is making bears nervous. Shorts are starting to close.
@_date: 2018-08-12 15:17:45
Fuck it all guys, I'm still buying. I hope it goes to 4k that way I can afford more. 
@_date: 2018-05-15 11:40:08
I don't take anything seriously from redditors who made their account a week ago.
@_date: 2018-05-16 05:25:29
I love how everyone freaks out when I knew all along this was going to happen. We needed to have a correction, I think the upbit news just triggered it early.  In the long run this will be healthy for bitcoin as long as we don't fall much past 7250. 7800 and 7250 are the prices this could reverse, so those are both great places to buy.
@_date: 2018-05-11 09:38:09
No not at all. These scammers really exist on dating apps.
@_date: 2018-08-26 08:04:48
Yeah that sub is in complete shambles, it's hilarious to watch.
@_date: 2018-08-28 06:09:39
That is the question, isn't it.
@_date: 2018-08-26 20:34:17
Lol you don't even understand how bitcoin works do you? Why are you on this sub? While I do agree that certain people in the bitcoin scene are scammers and frauds, bitcoin itself is not. And people who buy bitcoin are not investors. That isn't how it works. Bitcoin is a commodity.
@_date: 2018-05-15 11:41:48
It depends, the price is currently scraping the top of this downtrend channel. So either it breaks out or it dumps hard today.
@_date: 2018-08-13 07:21:52
Yeah I've been dollar cost averaging since about August of last year. Only putting in what's leftover from my paycheck, money I would normally be wasting on stuff I don't need.
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:55:59
It isn't wrong yet!! lol
@_date: 2018-08-28 06:08:37
They're getting a whole new influx of younger viewers because of bitcoin. They have to be noticing this. Their youtube channel is evidence enough. Every video about bitcoin has substantially more views than the others.
@_date: 2018-05-11 17:15:46
They have asked for iTunes cards before but I'm not dumb enough to fall for it.
@_date: 2018-05-11 22:12:08
If anyone is interested, I posted my very first idea to tradingview. I see a cup and handle forming with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-27 06:36:51
Also, look at the BCH-BTC chart. It tells the real story.
@_date: 2018-05-16 10:13:00
Honestly it's just regular market movement. We had a nice recovery from the bottom but we were due for a correction. My prediction is that we hit 7800 but then go up from there.
@_date: 2018-05-30 07:26:13
This is why we need bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:06:56
Everyone's saying consensus is a dud and then this happens lol.
@_date: 2018-05-13 08:18:46
8250 is the 0.5 fib retracement and 7800 is the 0.618 fib. Usually in a correction it will go to the 0.618 level rather than just stopping at the 0.5.
@_date: 2018-05-12 15:23:17
I think you're right in that this still has a ways to go down. My current target is 7800, but it could also hit 7250. Then I think it will move back up from there.
@_date: 2018-05-17 05:55:09
I think we'll keep going down until 7800. Then flatten out and slowly rise back up.
@_date: 2018-05-15 07:17:15
If bitcoin doesn't hit 10k by the end of July, I'll eat a dick.
@_date: 2018-05-30 12:02:21
I agree. For once I'm actually more scared about what my stocks are going to do than my bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-13 08:19:46

I thought I read somewhere that address didn't belong to Mt Gox.
@_date: 2018-05-13 08:11:23
I agree. My target price I see us hitting is 7800 at least. 7250 is also a possibility. But I'm not a permabear, I think we will likely go up from there.
@_date: 2018-08-27 00:35:58
Careful, some of them are leaking their saltiness into this sub, so be aware of that.
@_date: 2018-05-14 09:40:30
God, one little correction and everyone thinks it's all over and bitcoin is dead. This is nothing. The price can't just go up forever, there are always corrections.
@_date: 2018-05-14 11:49:26
If we don't see bitcoin at least around 17k before the end of the year I would be surprised.
@_date: 2018-05-14 10:47:38
Ok, talk to me again in december and we'll see where we are at.
@_date: 2018-05-12 00:44:58
I am a believer in bitcoin in the long term. But like anything else it follows market patterns. My TA is not a reccomendation to buy or sell, I don't even do any short term trades on bitcoin myself. I have been adding to my stack every time the price drops. Just sharing my analysis of what's going on with the price. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:04:47
Oh I didn't know you could do that. Where can you listen/watch it?
@_date: 2018-10-29 12:21:14
I made no predictions. All I said was that it was unlikely that we break below 5900. Which we haven't. My recommendation to buy still stands.
@_date: 2018-10-15 11:24:59
"Redditor for 2 days", you can tell the fud is manufactured.
@_date: 2018-10-29 11:15:51
Yes, all things considered, the risk to the downside is minimal. Bears have tried and tried to push it down past 5900 but were unable to after multiple attempts. My guess is that some big whales do not want the price to go below support. The safest option though would be to wait for the breakout. A lot of traders are waiting for the price to convincingly break 7000 before buying back in.
@_date: 2018-10-15 11:22:52
They are the ones saying this pump was due to tether imploding. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 08:09:51
Oof. But yeah it will probably be 2020 before we get a new ath. It could be sooner but it will happen eventually. No point in selling now.
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:50:23
I prefer the term investor. :p I know there's a slim possiblity it may never recover but if there's any chance it could blow up again I'm willing to take it. 
I didn't buy anywhere near the top plus I have only a small portion of my portfolio in crypto. I'm actually still up on my initial buy in. But I believe in it in the long run. You don't know the future any more than I do.
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:33:06
Use GDAX instead. You can log in with your coinbase account info. It's more complicated but there are much lower fees.
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:11:03
A lot of people will be looking to add around 5k I think.
@_date: 2018-06-04 11:35:18
It's not going to ever go below 5k. If it does I'll eat my nutsack.
@_date: 2018-06-13 09:57:58
Right but there's a huge difference between bitcoin and a defunct fraudulent company.
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:33:58
What's funny is that if we just all forgot about the price for one second, we would be very excited about all the good news reguarding bitcoin lately. Or you know, zoom out on the chart. It's still up more than 600% from the beginning of last year. That's unheard of in the stock market. So I don't understand who all these people are that say bitcoin is dead and will never recover. They must have been the ones who bought at 19k and sold at 7k.
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:00:47
How can you compare a disruptive technology like bitcoin to these defunct companies? All your doing is purposely trying to scare people into selling.
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:48:16
Bitcoin has nothing? Ok. You need to do some more research.
@_date: 2018-06-04 10:16:57
I just wanted to point out something so that when it happens nobody panics. The tops and bottoms have been happening on the 6th of the month since the spike in December. If we hit a lower low on June 6th, say 6000 or lower, it's actually incredibly bullish. We can only go up from there. So keep this in mind and get your buy orders ready.
@_date: 2018-06-04 11:39:04
What's with all the fudsters? This Is how I know its a great time to buy.
@_date: 2018-06-14 10:16:31
Why did bitcoin spike on Google trends recently? 
@_date: 2018-06-11 06:30:02
This will be the last time to buy bitcoin under $7000. Mark my words.
@_date: 2018-06-04 11:40:58
It's in the process of setting up a triple bottom. I still think we have some room to go down. My prediction is that we hit 6500 or so in a few days then up from there to try and get past 10k again.
@_date: 2018-06-14 11:39:09
The searches never increased during the other two lows. I'm thinking something else is causing this.
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:58:03
Stop fudding. All that was hacked was a small Korean exchange. This story is being blown out of proportion.
@_date: 2018-06-05 12:13:55
I think we'll hit just around 7200 and then back up from there to try and break past 10k again.
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:56:13
What is with you fudsters comparing bitcoin to enron? Second person I've seen doing that today. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:09:21
Why even waste your time posting here.
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:52:08
I have. There is still not concrete evidence. Just a lot of speculation.
@_date: 2018-06-11 07:00:26
"Redditor for 3 months"
@_date: 2018-06-11 08:17:51
It will get there eventually. Might take another year or two if this is really going to play out into an extended bear market.
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:00:14
I have no idea what your talking about, the fundamentals have never been better.
@_date: 2018-06-06 08:12:58
??? What chart are you looking at? Yes we've dropped down to 7000 for the 3rd time or so but honestly it's holding above that point pretty well. This is pretty bullish as it establishes 7000 as strong support. Btw when I say 7000 i really mean the range from about 6500 to 7000, nothing is exact. So how that is "dropping like a rock" is beyond me.
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:25:08
You're delusional.
@_date: 2018-06-03 05:33:42
While there are a lot of altcoins with great projects and teams working hard to create something great, bitcoin has withstood the test of time. I would say put about 80% into bitcoin and then spread the rest out into altcoins with promise. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:43:19
Even though manipulation may have played a role in it, it was not the sole reason. Remember how bitcoin was all over the news in December, it blew up. Everyone was talking about it. That was mostly natural hype that drove the price up so high. And I haven't seen any proof of this manipulation yet.
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:07:56
Damn the fudsters are out today huh. You people are fools.
@_date: 2018-06-13 05:16:50
You don't lose any money unless you sell. And you don't lose any btc unless you sell. The price will recover eventually.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:12:42
They must not have updated that page yet. If you look at the actual wallet page, you'll see it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:59:59
You can still use GDAX I'm pretty sure.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:09:46
I don't think so, you have to have money in your USD wallet either on gdax or transfer it from coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:11:44
It's an online coin wallet that lets you store a bunch of different altcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:56:13
They verify your identity to make sure you aren't doing anything illegal. Do what you want, but don't come crying to us when your account gets closed because you gave them false information.
@_date: 2018-06-13 11:09:26
"It doesn't have a project". What exactly do you mean by this? But yes redditor for three weeks let me take your wise advice and invest primarily in shit coins. Dentacoin for instance. Or I hear bitconnect is at a nice discount from the highs.

I am still quietly buying here. Not dumping all my money in or anything but just continually dca buying every pay day. Am I an idiot? I guess only time will tell.
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:57:16
Exactly. Everybody just seeing the crash needs to zoom way out. BTC will hit ath's  again. It will also fall over 60% again.

Whos address is that? Mt gox guy?

@_date: 2018-03-19 11:27:42
Pretty sure there was already good news.
@_date: 2018-03-28 06:05:02
Waiting for sub 6k to buy with part of my tax return.
@_date: 2018-03-15 12:24:34
Its likely we hit about 6800 and bounce from there. It will zig zag up and down on its way down but im holding off buying until then.
@_date: 2018-02-16 11:37:59
@_date: 2018-03-07 06:21:22
Maybe because people where reporting it.
@_date: 2018-03-10 02:21:17
Lol no

Nobody is going to be bankrupt if they only invested what they could afford to lose. Obviously if you put your entire life savings into bitcoin, you don't just hodl till it's worth pennies.
@_date: 2018-02-17 14:49:35
I use their exchange gdax because I can buy with my bank account and transfer for zero fees. On no other exchange can you do that currently.
@_date: 2018-02-16 11:40:33
Robinhood once that's fully up and running.
@_date: 2018-03-06 22:17:08
So does the update fix the security issue then?
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:53:37
I would recommend starting with Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-02-13 08:15:31
Oof. Please Microsoft, go easy on bcash, it was dying already.
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:55:06
Yeah people who sold around 8k or lower got FUDed bad.
@_date: 2018-02-21 11:31:58
Exactly. When you daytrade and try to time the market it will eventually catch up to you. You might sell and then buy back in at the right times 9 out of 10 times. But it just takes one fuck up to lose a huge chunk of money that way. There was a guy who posted on here a few months ago saying that he lost over $200k from daytrading.
The smartest and easiest approach is to buy and hodl, aka invest for the long term.  Which is what any financial expert would tell you about anything.
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:19:16
Oh I love how depressed everyone gets on here when the price goes down. And then how euphoric the same people were when the price was skyrocketing. This is why market cycles happen, because human behavior (to a certain degree) is predictable.
@_date: 2018-03-10 02:21:25
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:50:08
It bounced because it fell too low with the correction. A lot of people were waiting to buy once it dropped below 8k.
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:52:58
Same, I'm still buying dips believe it or not. Of course I haven't invested any more than I'm willing to lose, just saving part of my disposable income every paycheck to buy. I think we will eventually make it back up to the highs, even if it takes a few years. We've seen what's possible as far as the price and there's no reason it couldn't get there again. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:21:14
I mean the same thing was said 2 years ago about 10k.
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:06:09
I just got paid, would now be a good time to buy or like in a couple days?
@_date: 2018-03-07 06:21:43
Maybe because people were reporting it.
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:01:20
I wish we would go back that low, I would buy more.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:37:16
Exactly that's what all this fud is about. They want our bitcoin. They don't care about the money or monetary value. They want more bitcoin because they know how much power bitcoin will have in the future.  They don't want the people to have all the power. That's my conspiracy theory at least. All I know is I'm buying.
@_date: 2017-10-01 06:01:21
Everyone's forgetting what happened with the bitcoin cash. Originally coinbase planned on not supporting it and not giving people their rightfully owned bitcoin cash after the fork. They warned everyone about it and told them to withdraw their coins well in advance if you wanted the bitcoin cash. Well people were still angry and complaining about it and last I heard they were working on adding support for bitcoin cash. 
I expect this may be a similar situation. Worst case scenario they do only want to support the 2x btc but they will warn their users well in advance of the fork. Now if they do this a ton of people are going to pull their money from the site so they will most likely just end up supporting both coins.
@_date: 2018-02-21 12:13:32
Agreed, I'm guessing that if we can get past $12.5k we will rally back up past $17k shortly after.
@_date: 2018-02-16 06:22:58
I think that's the joke.
@_date: 2018-02-17 01:15:21
I've been checking my bank account like a mad man because if this happened to me it would really screw me. Luckily it hasn't. As far as I can tell it only affected people who payed with a visa credit or debit card between a week ago and the end of January.

And there's the bounce! Thank God almighty.

Here in my garaaaaaaage
@_date: 2018-02-09 06:12:17
Bought at 8.5k thinking it would go up more, RIP me
@_date: 2018-02-01 06:51:58
Everyone said it was going down to 8k with this tether FUD, but it's hodling very steady around 10k now. I honestly hope it stays around here for another month just so I can get a couple more paychecks to buy more at this price.
@_date: 2017-10-02 19:44:52
My guess is that it will even further legitimize bitcoin and spread it to more people who dismissed it or didn't know much about it before. More investors will buy it and people will start using bitcoin to save for retirement and things like that. More buyers will drive the price up significantly. At least that is my educated guess. I do think that people who have not bought before will feel more comfortable buying from a recognizable name like Goldman Sachs compared to any of the current exchanges.
@_date: 2018-02-16 11:39:57
Well great, right when we were on a nice little rally back up, this load if fud gets dumped on us. On the bright side, at least I am not one of the people who had their bank accounts drained by this.
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:03:12
All I can say is that i don't foresee it going down past 7500 anytime soon. That bounce was way too steep. Too many people waiting to buy around there.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:01:23
@_date: 2018-07-17 12:09:45
Right, I don't know anyone except me and my brother who actually bought bitcoin. But everyone at my work was talking about it.
@_date: 2018-02-27 11:16:22
Trading view.
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:51:41
You're right, in some ways it does act like a typical investment. The more you put in and the longer you leave it in, the more you will get out of it. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 06:22:13
See, what happens is that they take over a verified person's account. Change the name and picture, then they are still verified. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:39:40
Aaaaaaaand it's gone.
@_date: 2018-02-09 07:11:08
I know, I'm a long term hodler, I don't plan on selling till it hits 100k at least. I wish I would have bought at 6k but I had to wait for my money to get to coinbase.
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:09:22
From my very limited understanding, I think how to get around the double spending problem was what stumped people for at least some time. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:29:51
Yes it's bots but also people who have set orders at a certain price on an exchange.
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:48:01
I have no guarantee its going to skyrocket again. But this is crypto, we've seen it do this time and time again. One big crash has not killed bitcoin before, and it won't kill it this time. Despite the price, the tech is still solid. We will be using blockchain integrated technology in the future. That is guaranteed.
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:05:31
My first purchase was at 4800 near the last all time high, but I bought more when it dipped to about 3200. My bitcoins are now worth over $100 what I paid for it. Buy and hodl, to the moooooon!
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:24:06
Am I the only one perfectly fine with the price staying at these levels? That way I can buy more now while its low. I'm confident that bitcoin will be worth a lot more some time in the future and I'm patient enough to wait for that. The fundamentals have not changed, we havn't even had any serious fud in a while, in fact weve had a lot of good news.
@_date: 2018-07-12 12:23:03
Right, it's much safer to buy at these levels than during the huge run up. The majority of people don't realize that though. That's why the market is the way it is.
@_date: 2018-04-08 13:44:42
I've had no problems with coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:51:14
All the shorters just got rekt.
@_date: 2018-04-12 06:05:38
The big wigs are definitely buying right now.
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:24:22
I think it's still too soon to say that.
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:52:39
No news, simple ta. I knew this would happen.
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:55:26
You should have never invested money that you couldn't afford to lose. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 07:40:43
Exactly. Plus there were some issues with the IRS website causing even more people to need extensions. If tax season is really pulling the price down, I expect it to continue for at least another few weeks.
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:01:33
The magic button is called time. We've only been here in this range for less than 2 weeks.
@_date: 2018-04-08 09:18:04
Watch out guys, now that Soros wants in, I wouldnt be surprised if he hires people to spread fud online and then short the price.
@_date: 2018-04-01 05:34:25
Bitcoin has died on the death cross and will rise again.
@_date: 2018-04-24 10:40:27
If anything I think Tom Lee's hypothesis that tax selling was keeping the price down was mostly correct. The slow rise of the price now is just the normal market movement where the number of buyers &gt; number of sellers. As long as there is no major fud I think the price will continue to slowly rise.
