I get paid on a Paycard from Wal-Mart. It's just convenient to keep it and I can use it like a debit card so there has not really been a need for a Bank account till now. Since I didn't pass your scrutiny and you just had to be vindicated I hope this helps. The thing I am buying in Canada is to replace something of my Roommates not a luxury item and none of your fucking business.

You are a real piece of shit

You're right. You clearly have it together. You make snap judgements about people and pick fights on the Internet to flex your e peen. We could all learn from you.

So I guess I am confused because before I only saw a local seller options to buy Bitcoin for more then I was looking to acquire for the purchase. The cheapest options I seen was $200.00 
Here is part of the issue, I get paid from my job by a pay card and don't have a bank account. Hence me making so little money and not just buying the amount of Bitcoin that was more then needed. If Circle gives the option to purchase a specific amount of Bitcoin in the $50.00 range then I can get a US Bank account on my next payday as I know they are .. Bitcoin friendly..?  
After I get the Bank account there then if I can buy the amount of Bitcoin I was looking to purchase I will try a combination of these options and ask for a little help to make the process a little more..accessible to a layman.

Sounds like a pattern. Maybe you should reflect on that

I didn't have a 50.00 option only sellers in the amount of 200.00 plus. I can't afford that.

I understand but at the time I was looking to make the purchase I only had a local seller option to buy more then i needed or could afford I guess i just didn't go to the right site.
