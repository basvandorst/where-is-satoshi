omg scammer

That makes a lot of sense, It just removes the opportunity to mine for people with powerful home computers I guess. That's not to say that the new ASIC miners won't all try to sell their ~50 bitcoins each week in a desperate effort to re-coup the initial investment

BTC difficulty will adjust in about 13 hours from now, I'll probably be switching back to LTC tomorrow.

Oh okay I didn't know that. Its an Extreme6; I was told the 4 and 6 have the same VRM design I guess they were wrong. Vcore 1.32

This is good to know, I didn't know that it was such a large pool compared to the introduction of new coins
@_date: 2013-03-22 07:50:06
Oh awesome I didn't know this. So there is hope of a more gradual change. Seeing as rapid change just adds to the volatility this is good news

We did it reddit!

what is satoshi dice and why would a miner block it? thanks
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:23:19
that market price option makes day traders a lot of money
@_date: 2013-06-05 04:18:39
And what, nobody is allowed to make money?

Low end GPU's tend to be of higher efficiency. are you using the AMD 5xxx series? I've heard they are the best w/$ ratio
@_date: 2013-06-05 09:46:59
I'm guessing a shift of GPU miners to litecoin (back to litecoin for some miners), possibly a slight rise in value of BTC
I'm wondering what everyone else thinks though too.
@_date: 2013-05-29 05:00:33
Yes but it has to rise faster than mining difficulty
@_date: 2013-06-05 16:18:12
More scarce, deflation
@_date: 2013-03-24 08:51:37
how long has it been?
@_date: 2013-03-22 07:06:50
This would be the first day in a while where we haven't had crazy growth
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:52:54
Thanks so much. Ill delete my post
@_date: 2013-05-12 06:27:04
What the fuck?
@_date: 2013-03-22 07:06:17
That makes sense, how long does it take to mine 2016 blocks then roughly? the difficulty has been at 4847647 for ages it would seem

*semi* digital VRMs. PWM stands for pulse-width modulation. I have an asrock Z77 board with a 3570k at 5GHz; so they're doing something right
