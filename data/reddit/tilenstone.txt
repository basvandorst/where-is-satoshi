The proof-of-work part of the currency goes at the problem the wrong way, and that was obvious from the beginning. The proof-of-work scheme, originally designed for solving the email spam problem, was obviously going to fail; namely spammers would be motivated to develop faster and faster hashing devices while it would be a total waste to trouble the ordinary person sending an email with such an extra step. One wonders if that was the reason the scheme was never successful for dealing with email spam.
In the bitcoin world, on the one hand, a huge amount of energy  is used to operate all the miners, while on the other hand it is impossible for an average person to become a meaningful part of the transaction processing network (it has become elistist). But wait a moment, why is mining tied to transaction processing? Oh ok, that was supposed to be an ingenious idea. So the P2P part is getting diluted. But that is really no surprise, from the design.
You will also list as a negative aspect that it was not based on a protocol specification, instead it was first published in the form of an implementation. Case in point: the first link at  is to the source

I think in terms of designing a currency one would not from the start include a whole new programming language ("Script"), especially not if it is Turing complete (who's going to run a script that may take years to complete or never?). Instead, one would worry about extensibility of the system, what is the process for updating the protocol?
The current size of the blockchain, together with the exponential increase that is to be expected with any meaningful use of the currency, also points to deficiencies in the design.
So there, something to think about.
