check mtgox.com's last or weighted average, it will give you an idea, but localbitcoin people generally charge a more for risk/having to meet etc.

Yes, I am part of a pool, coins are only "mined' in blocks of 25 and with only one graphics card you would have to mine for years before having even a chance of discovering a block, and by then ASICS will have taken over anyways. So yeah pools are the way to go. Getting started isn't hard, [this]( is a set up guide for the pool i am in. There are plenty of pools/guilds out there, even a [reddit]( one. You can find a more complete list of pools [here]( are also mining calculators like [this one]( that will give you an idea of whether you would be loosing or earning money  (remember though, the calculator does not take into account the expected increase in difficulty due to ASICs, and even if you are operating at a loss today, you might not be if you sell your BTC at a higher exchange rate)

Had a similar situation with one of my tenants (also out of state student) and the DMV, in our case I just supplied her with a copy of the rental agreement (keep your copies! they come in handy), and the DMV was fine with it. Maybe you have something like that? (note, i do seem to remember this was just after she moved in, so it would have fallen in the 3 month window i guess)

Yeah, this would be my advice too, I am still making about 0.03 btc a day, which is still a few dollars (especially considering my computer would be on regardless, now its just on and a bit more noisy)

That's the law enforcement for you, they will tell uncles a raid on an exchange is coming, but will omit the name just to make things a bit more interesting. 
I guess they are going for all the servers spread across the world at once then

Is that a feature of the tipbot? 
If it is, then thats a cool feature, and ill be interested to see how it was implemented. 
Think it would be difficult to take back the tip from whomever you tipped IRL, as it would be a new wallet which (hopefully) you dont have access to (much like the way the casascius coins work).

*must resist making "ban physical currency" petition*
**Ban Sterling banknotes**
Responsible department: Department for Culture, Media and Sport
Sterling banknotes are used by hackers and other people trying to evade the law (child pornographers, terrorists, etc.)
Therefore they should be made illegal.

This also seems to be a great way to remove bitcoins from circulation. 
I give 0.1 BTC to the cleaner at the office, she does nothing with it (she wouldn't, she is 70 and eyes our computers with universal disdain), and the Bitcoin economy is now 20,999,999.9 Not a huge difference, but one which could add up in the long run. 
Seems to me that a bitcoin tip as starter package after a BTC conversation could make sense, but not just "out of the blue". I would guess half the people receiving it would assume its a scam of some sorts (not helped when they go to MtGox, and they ask for their SSN), and the other half will figure for $5 its not worth their time. 
This also applies to reddit tipbot in other subreddits, but at least the average redditor has heard of bitcoin, and might consider it the excuse needed to look into it further

Just to be clear, on the btc-e page under BTC/USD, when you scroll down to "Your current active orders" is your order listed there?" If it is, then it wasnt filled and you can safely go ahead and cancel the order. 
Well its not peer to peer in the sense that a bitcoin is not transferred from their personal wallet to yours (it all happens in the BTC-E environment), so in that sense BTC-E is acting like a "bank". 
What happens is that when you go to buy BTC you can choose how much you want to buy, and at which price you want to buy. If you do not change the price you want to buy, then the default price is the most recent posted price. Normally, if the price isnt increasing fast that will still be the price BTC is trading at when you press "buy BTC", and someone will be willing to sell their BTC at that price.  However if you are offering $80 for a BTC, and someone else is offering $81 for a BTC, the next sale will be made at $81, as a seller given the choice between $80 and $81 will pick the latter. As long as the sales price remains above what you are offering the order that you have placed will not be filled. 
The TL;DR version of this is that it is my understanding that BTC-E does set the "best current price," but it doesn't update it after you have filed an active order, so its possible that by the time your order is filed the price will have moved, and no one is willing to sell at the price you offered. 
What I am not sure about though is your statement that the transaction amount is pending in your trade history. That has never happened to me, and could be an indication that something else is going on.

make sure you get a decent exchange rate BTC has dropped almost $100 in the past few hours, and you dont want to pay yesterdays price

reminds me of the Bran Ferren quote. "technology is stuff that doesn’t work yet."
When bitcoin becomes predictable and boring we will have a currency that just works. I personally believe that widespread bitcoin success will only arrive when all but the most hardcore bitcoin fans find it boring.
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:17:16
oh ok, so half the order got filled at the price you wanted, but not the other. If you cancel I suspect you would get the bitcoins from the part of the order that were filled (as someone has already accepted your USD in payment for them) , and the USD for the part that was not filled.
This would be my best guess at least

Its a gamble I take every day when paying with cash, however its a minor one because most of the places I go have a reputation I trust (the Subway employee wont run off with my cash). In the long run this will be the case in the Bitcoin economy too.

If everyone goes to the other exchanges we will just crash the other exchanges... vircurex crashed during an LTC pump a few days ago, if they cant handle the limited number of LTC speculators, do you think they can handle the mtgox hordes?

Transfered via CVS yesterday. The money was added to mtgox before I even left the store, so no, no scam

Well you dont know where its headed (so 10,000 is pure speculation) apart from that though yeah, the people selling are the people who expected their money to double every few days, thats not how you build a currency

It's basically a cliche on this subreddit, but don't invest more than you can stand to loose. If I were you I would probably invest a few hundred. If bitcoins *really* take off even a few bitcoins will be worth a lot, and so you will still have a good profit. If bitcoin collapses you wont be broke.  
If you do decide to invest it all, I am not sure i would invest it all right now. There is a pretty close correlation between media attention and bitcoin prices, right now bitcoins are hot in the media, but if [history is a guide]( the will be a correction once the media cycle moves on.

The internet archive gives the option to pay part of their employees wages in bitcoin. I am sure archive.org will report those amounts, just as they would the rest of their wages. 
That said I am sure the USD is not going away any time soon, however maybe more realistic in a country which has reason to distrust the local economy, and is technologically savvy, Iceland perhaps?
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:26:37
Are you sure that the order was filled, and you didint simply file an order that no one picked up? (in BTC-e it appears as though the money is spent when the order is placed, not when it is filled)
