I just skipped the phone verification and went to name address etc.

I was under 18 for the past 9 years

*Because people are buying them and he made $12K*
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:12:28
Yeah I'm in the US but look at how dumb of a 'verification' check that was. Anyway too late now.
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:34:24
I'd rather manufacture them and make $12K off people who like nice communication goodies and finger toys like this guy

My bank still does the "what's the name of the street you grew up on?" security questions. I remember going over them with the account manager and giving a completely unrelated answer to the question and she goes, 'but that makes no sense.' Yeah, exactly. Who the fuck is going to actually give an authentic answer to a question that can be found out using Google.

The nerve of these kinds of people. Do they think you somehow forget how they treated you when things were not going well? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:58:06
Well if you want to grind away for an hourly rate I guess more power to you then.

Mining without hardware is obviously a scam yes, but the calculator? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:12:43
80/20 rule

It would be better to buy while the price is rising. You won't get much more than about $4 per day even with the best gpu... Unless you have a farm. But then you have invested thousands which would have gained a profit in days

Sorry I don't have $9,000 laying around. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:44:12


Prepare to invest thousands of dollars and lots of time mining, dollars and time that would be better invested in research and the market. I spent $600 on a GPU that, in all reality, was for games by saying, 'this is an investment! It's for bitcoin!'. 48 hrs later and I've made a $5.72 ROI. Now think about the ROI today on $600 about a week ago.

Ok I see the error now. Just didn't see why this site calculates in dollars per kwh while every other energy site uses cents.

Needed it to pay off the house completely

Is this misspelling of 'holding' an inside joke here or something. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:06:50
Yes that's what I'm using. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:39:50
I'll look into it

What if you *don't have a job* at all?
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:27:32
My only concern is not being able to cash out when I want. I've read about 3 or 4 stories on Reddit since last night about Coinbase that makes me not trust the services users are trading on, and yet it's the company that is always recommended. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:53:05
I fixed it. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:56:49
As far as electricity? It's too soon to tell. Their calculator says I should be making $80 profit per month.

@_date: 2017-11-10 15:36:22
Should it be 0.12? I'm just going by the format of a site like [this]( It's actually a little more according to this one.   
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:27:48
So what site provides the real numbers?
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:31:50
Copy/paste? I don't see how you would input the wrong address unless you are typing manually, and I've done that lots of times with tracking # as a new seller on eCommerce sites. Never an issue with automation.

Some of the biggest marketplaces (like Coinbase) are corrupt, or incompetent depending on who you ask.

Spoken like a true peasant.
