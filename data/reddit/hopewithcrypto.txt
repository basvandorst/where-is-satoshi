Holy cow, I had no idea about the USDT on Poloniex! I had never looked closely at the USDT tab and just assumed it was USD. Do you have a recommendation for a market to sell my BTC on? I have looked at GDAX, albeit somewhat hesitantly. Also, what would the benefit of selling for USD on an exchange over selling on localbitcoins? Thank you again for your input!

Combined interest rate is about 7.5%. Also, if you are willing to explain, what do you mean hedge agains bitcoin?

Thank you! I'll read it this evening.

I can only imagine. I want that feeling. I currently pay $1200 a month for my student loans, and getting rid of that expense sounds goddamn magical.

I'm already paying $1200/month on my loans. Paying more is not an option, unfortunately =(

Also, what do you mean by "why not wait until fiat inflates further?"

Luckily, I am planning first selling the 1.5 BTC that I have not done anything with except for hold it in a wallet. That should be easy enough to report capital gains on. I do have 0.3 BTC in my wallet that was profits from trades on Poloniex, so that will probably be a bit more complicated to pay taxes on. That is honestly where I get a bit confused... that profit is from using BTC to purchase a variety of other coins, then sold them for more BTC for profit. They have never been converted back to fiat, however. I would think that I would be computing those as like-kind trades, but I know very little about what that actually looks like when reporting it to the IRS should I sell it for USD.

Any chance you can explain more please?

... the fuck is wrong? 2.5 BTC as of December 2016 was not that much...

I paid $19.95 because I bought full functionality for 2017 earlier in the year. Now, they have tiered payment levels, up to 1000 trades is $29.95, up to 5000 trades is $39.95, and the tiers continue to increase from there.

Oh, I understand now where you're coming from. Actually, I found someone who was wanting to sell in-person with cash, and was a new account trying to build rep so he sold me the BTC for $150 USD under the market price. At the time of purchase, BTC was selling for around $900 USD/BTC, so $150 USD discount was pretty significant (purchased 2.5 BTC for $750 USD per BTC)

I absolutely love love love love this site. It has taken all of the fear out of tax calculations for my trades.

I tried cointracking.info and, although it is as powerful as bitcoin.tax, it is WAY more expensive and less user-friendly in my opinion.
