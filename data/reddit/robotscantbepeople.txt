Meh I made 160% profit in three months. I’m cool.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:32:59
I’ll be honest. Every dip I’m scared. Every dip I hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:41:36
This IS the correction.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:39:52
Isn’t that already a thing? I have one already...

Okay then!

It is easy to run your own node and one cannot pay every potential node runner a few to turn off their node.  One would first find it difficult to contact current node runners to offer them money to turn off their node. Once it is announced that there is a party paying to turn off nodes, node production would skyrocket as owning a node to shut it down now has value.  So, offering money to shut down nodes would have the exact reverse effect you’re looking at.

@_date: 2017-12-05 22:13:43
Great question! Probably started closer to 60%
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:44:28
Bottom 20%

Good god. What’s wrong with you? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:08:15
Close to 80/90%

That was like an eight second clip.

Think of all the worthy causes one could donate for. AIDS assistance in Africa, helping a family buy their first goat for milk, cancer research etc... you’re saying that you want help because you squandered you life savings on a scam? You’re a kid that lives with his parents. Grow up dude. This world isn’t here for you. You’re here to help the world.

Who the fuck do you think you are to believe you deserve charity? You want free money so you can be rich? People are fucking dying because they don’t have clean water. Go get a job. Live frugally. Give to charitable causes. Invest in bitcoin if you have any left over.  And get the fuck out of here.

Corrections generally correlate with bad news. As far as I can tell it’s been going up whenever no bad news it out. Considering there are 200k new Coinbase users daily (is this correct?) bitcoin is stronger than ever and increasing in interest at an increasing rate. Market corrections are a fact of the product, but a correction may take place in a day or in three months. In either case it’s worth getting in, not sitting out.
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:07:13
You shorting?
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:14:09

@_date: 2017-11-07 21:43:37
Judging by today I’d say nah

I’m not super concerned about fees today, more concerned about fees 10 years from now. Is it a slow upgrade kind of thing or big leap to big leap? Is there a chance fees will be less than standard credit card rates when making purchases?

I would rather have my $500 this week be worth $1000 in 20 weeks instead of $500.

@_date: 2017-11-13 22:26:45
How would everyone in bitcoin make the transactions cheaper given the fact more transactions are currently making it more expensive?  IM SO CONFUSED

LN? Lightning network? Isn’t that just a medium of exchange or a currency or what.  Are big the big transactions you’re talking about currently handicapped by fiat?

A lot of people are expecting a market correction. A lot of people are out hoping it will go down a lot to buy back in. A lot of people expect the market to keep going up so they’ve stayed in. A lot of people went to btc because they think that will go up. A lot of people buy gold.

Man for someone who doesn’t want sympathy or attention or money, you sure are posturing for sympathy attention and money quite a bit. Maybe if you didn’t respond all day to every comment in this thread you could get a job and make enough money to have more than $1750 in savings by 26.

Would still rather him say “bitcoin is worth having in your portfolio “
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:00:46
That’s awesome. Where can I learn about LN. sounds like you’re saying... I’d make a LN connection (for an upfront fee) with my hotdog vendor and from that point forward transactions are fast and inexpensive.
What I mean by handicapped by fiat is that what problems are banks and large vendors running into that are overcome by bitcoin transaction?
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:35:05
let's see, if i buy at a dollar and sell at two dollars, that means one can buy at two dollars and sell at two dollars. the only way you have a loser is if the price goes down. okey dokey bye.

The Wire is slightly better than Game of thrones, but less entertaining.  It is equal to breaking bad in overall quality, although a little older.  It also isn't as entertaining.
The characters are verrrrry unique, but unique in the way that real life people are unique.  They don't seem like characters.  They are real people.  It's my  for best shows of all time.

@_date: 2013-12-17 02:01:43
Well, the lower the price gets the less miners will mine.  It's not worth it to spend $500 on electricity to get a gain of $200 of BTC.  The market is very volatile and will eventually be worth as much as the inputs for  BTC.  In my opinion.  I'm not sure why that logic would be wrong.  I'd welcome differing opinoins!
