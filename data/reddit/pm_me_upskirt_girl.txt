All or nothing, very rational. While we’re at it, let’s make sure every child gets a gun and ammo that they must have full access to at all times, we would not want to go against the 2nd amendment in any way.


I can imagine a whole lot of crimes that are on the same level as child porn, it was just an example of a very serious crime that is enabled by a completely anonymous internet.


I’m happy to give up some of my rights to ensure that the weak and vulnerable are protected. If you can rationalize away all your empathy for victims of heinous crimes with slippery slope arguments about giving up ‘all’ your rights, just because you’re protecting your ‘rights’, I feel sorry for you. But don’t worry, it doesn’t even affect too many people, so it’s all ok.
If you want to live in a society where the law is just a suggestion, there are many places on earth where that applies. As someone who lived in such a country, I can tell you that it is not the Utopia that libertarians imagine it is.

The first amendment is more important than protecting children from molesters?
Because a completely anonymous internet is most definitely an enabler for distributing child porn.
I don’t care much about the drug angle, but the two are related because both are enabled by the dark web.
