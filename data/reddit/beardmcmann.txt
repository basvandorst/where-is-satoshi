This shows nothing except a case and some documentation. 
I'm calling HashCoin shill on you, man.

I see an opportunity here. Someone needs to pre-compile a raspi image that automatically runs as a bitcoin node and provides a walk-through GUI for port-forwarding and allows the blockchain to be stored on an external device like an external-HDD. I'm sure an image like that with just the linux kernel, the right libs and the bitcoin binary, as well as the few extra programs will be quite a hit. If someone did that work for me, I'd gladly buy a RasPi, and sacrifice some bandwidth and external HDD. If someone lowered the barrier to entry like this for me, I'd be right on board.

An ivy-league position doesn't guarantee credibility

Thanks for the info, man!

Hey dude, from what I understand armory is only officially supported on ubuntu and windows

Thanks for your time and information. 
Quick question: what is in your opinion the best method to obfuscate your keys while still making them make redundant. Also, do you pay particular attention to using non-volatile digital media to store your keys? 
Do your best to convince me to not use encrypted flash drives stored in safe places, I will learn a lot from it and be very grateful

The part about losing flash drives does sound all too familiar, but wouldn't a strong TrueCrypt volume encryption make it nearly impossible for the 'finding party' to get anything out of my suspicious USB stick?

So you compile a new binary every so often from git? Can you clarify? Sorry I'm a bit of a luddite?

No worries bro, I can respect that.
