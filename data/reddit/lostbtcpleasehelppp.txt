thanks, i will definitely try this later on. I want to exhaust any other options before I move on to the risky ones.

Thanks, I have not tried recovering via seed on windows/osx installed electrum, only tails. Will try now.

a HUGE thank you to everyone who had some input. Now the hard part, deciding the best way to store these damn coins long term...

Thanks, came accross this:
as long as you have access to the old wallet (both wallet file and the 1.8 wallet installed) and your wallet password you have access to all your funds without any worry.
if you have trouble upgrading it to 2.5 and higher just create a new wallet with your other computer using the new Electrum version and then go back to other computer (1.8 version) and export all your private keys and then transfer and import these in the new wallet by sweeping them.
if you want more detain don't hesitate to ask me.
My question is how do I export private keys and transfer and import them to my new wallet by "sweeping" them?

WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO Please send me your wallet address. $100USD coming your way!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I can't believe how simple this was. 
PS. the transaction has been sent and is still unconfirmed. once i get 1 confirmation the $100USD will be yours.
NOW how the hell am I going to keep this new wallet safe?? what is the best option for long term storage people???(might give a tip to anyone with a solid idea)
Note I would like to spend a coin or two every couple of weeks so it has to be easily accessible but still easy to store long term without losing whatever it is...

what happens if i lose it though?

12 words. Seed is definitely not wrong.
Yep definitely connected to Electrum. Iv'e toggled through a few networks and once connecting and syncing it still comes up with no balance or tranaction history.
Just checked the first receive address on blockchain.info, says all my BTC is still there but does not show up in the wallet.

they both look sweet, but what happens if i lose it???

i like copay, easy to use. but i dont like how it doesnt even have a pin code to log in. the wallets are just there when you click on the app. i see you can set a spending password which is good though
are people seriously holding hundreds of thousands on these apps?

Thanks, I have cloned and backed up the stick.
I have created a brand new up to date Tails usb with current electrum version and tried to open the wallet from seed, which works, but balance and transaction history is still not displayed.
Or do you mean open the actual wallet file in the new electrum? if so what is the best way to send the file to the new usb? i dont have access to another usb to transfer it over at the moment

Thanks. Every time I try to send any BTC it comes up with an error saying the version of Electrum is too old and I need to update. So I'm not sure installing any older versions will work? I will give it a try though
