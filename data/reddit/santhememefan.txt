It makes 0 sense to put the year first. 
DDMMYY is used in the uk because in conversation we would say the date as “today is the 28th of November 2019,
MMDDYY is used in the us because they say the date as “ today is November 28th 2019”
Absolutely no one mentions the date first when speaking. I do understand that it’s a date format and not a phrase used in a sentence but that’s just my own opinion lol.

Don’t stack sats, stack whole btc. 
Before someone says it I know a sat is a Satoshi....

I’ve read most ISO’s are just scams, the coin price is inflated to begin with. Everyone sells out as soon as it hits an exchange and the price plummets. 
Never been one for ISO’s tbh.

I’ve known about bitcoin since the beginning. Sold right before the 2017 boom, only just started using as a funds storage system recently. If I make some money in the process great. Lol.

You didn’t read properly pal.

Off topic: I hate it when people use the date format YYYY/MM/DD it’s just wrong.
@_date: 2019-12-28 21:17:35
I didn’t think so either lol. It’s doing it’s usual hovering around the same price again for now.

Certain factors make me able to save quite a bit of my salary, my accommodation costs are basically £0, food and drink is paid for, only bill I pay is my Internet, don’t use any credit at all, don’t make impulse purchases, don’t go out on weekends, the list goes on mate lol.... 
I may seem boring but tbh I’ve had my fare share of fucking around doing drugs, drinking, spending money on girls, buying designer clothing and the rest but honestly I’m in my late 20’s and for some reason none of that stuff really appeals to me anymore, saving for my future is the my high now, I get more of a buzz looking in my BTC wallet then I ever did from any drug. 
I wish you luck in your savings! Even 20-30% of your monthly salary is good enough for now and save up until you’ve got one whole years salary in btc. After that just hodl my brother ;) 
Happy new year

Just btc and hold, fuck all other coins they are worthless. Not even worth the man hours spent on the code.

Anyone liking blockchains mobile wallet? The fees aren’t bad at all. At most £0.03 GBP
