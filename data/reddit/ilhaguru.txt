By the looks of what she is doing, she aims to sell a service to banks and exchanges to cut their accounting and compliance cost. Doesn't look like she has any intention of offering a currency to the public.
This could be wildly successful for a while and bring tremendous and positive attention to the benefits of bitcoin, along with more investment and talent. 
Private chains will likely have their heyday IMO, but it will be short lived. Meanwhile the public blockchain will continue to be developed and strengthened and without a doubt will garner more support and talented developers.

It depends on the ponzi scheme. In some, those related to investment banking, there is no way around but giving the bank access to control your funds.

The intent behind your purchase, as stated in some media sources, is to create a liquidity pool for developing markets to alleviate scarcity issues in these markets. Sending these bitcoins outside US jurisdictions also serves another purpose: allaying some people's fears of accepting bitcoins that went through the hands of the Silk Road and the FBI (fungibility problem). Presumably, this is something that would be an issue mainly within US jurisdiction. Was this part of your idea in pursuing these bitcoins in specific, or just a happy coincidence?

Ownership and control are the same thing.
The fact that a thief may control something that is rightfully yours does not take away from the original definition in any way. Logic is not necessarily a two way street - cheese is made of milk, but milk is not made of cheese.

Absolutely false. 
Free market theory is very stark about limits: actors must not engage in violent or fraudulent behavior. Period. Every person must be free of this type of coercion. This is basic human rights, as well.
That does not guarantee that there won't be violence or fraudulent behavior, but violating the rule above is a very clear criminal act AND a violation of free market principles.
The problem that left of center views see is that there are a number of behaviors that are harsh in nature that do not fall under those two categories. It's one of those things that are not a crime, but aren't nice, either. Meanwhile, a lot of people who have right of center views don't give a damn about it and accuse the left of being overly sensitive.
Where the left goes wrong is in choosing to counter that harsh behavior by violating the anti-aggression principle with the myriad of laws and regulations they pass. It is completely unnecessary to do this, it always causes unforeseen consequences, and the punishment is necessarily an excessive use of force (any use of force would be excessive) while any fines or slap on the wrist rarely ever achieves anything consequential. It makes for great election year politics, though, that's for damn sure - but unfortunate.

This is why I didn't just say yesterday, but rather a long time ago. A blood diamond mined 10 years ago has exactly zero effects on demand today and in the future. 
But the 10 year old blood diamond will always have a tainted history that people don't like and won't wear. Despite the fact it's just a rock with no further influence on demand. Do away with all suffering in diamond mining in Africa and elsewhere and some people will still not want the ones that were mined under those conditions in the past.

This professor at one point refers to people who use wallets as savings accounts as tax evaders, when in fact that is impossible. None of these people are getting paid interest on these "savings accounts" because a bitcoin credit market flat out doesn't exist. It is impossible to have earnings that way and thus, have any taxes owed at all.
Lastly, any money accumulated in this wallet that is earned elsewhere will only stay in that wallet for so long if the price of bitcoin stabilizes. In this case, there is no incentive to keep your money parked there. It will either be spent or invested, and that implies movement out of the wallet.

Currently, yes, you are absolutely right - its benefits are very limited and not for everyone. And bitcoin will take another 10 years or so to become a big deal for Americans and Europeans. 
In countries like Argentina and Venezuela, bitcoin is currently a very real, viable and helpful alternative to their national currencies. 
By 2020, bitcoin should stabilize sufficiently that many other countries with simply unstable currencies, rather than outright crisis like in Venezuela, will start using bitcoin. That is, its people will adopt it, though not necessarily their government who is in bed with banks.

Not really correct. Fractional reserve lending creates an effect, not an actuality. And even fractional reserve lending must originate from somebody's savings.
Also, you don't need to go through a depository institution to save money. After all, you can lend money to someone else yourself, without any other third party getting involved. That still counts as savings that is being lent out.
@_date: 2015-01-30 01:35:49
Because there is no consent with the USD or EUR or any other fiat currency. There is no telling what inflation will be like, whether it will be kept under control, etc, etc. 
The vast majority of fiat currencies in this planet have failed through hyperinflation. Currencies like the USD are the exception to the rule, not the norm - not by VERY far. And even so, high inflation has occurred before in the USD, too.

Lies, damn lies and statistics. 
A proper statistical comparison between the USA and Europe can massively reduce the difference between the gun crime rate in both places. The numbers often used compare firearm deaths in the USA (this includes suicide and accidents as well as actual crimes) to gun-related murder in Europe (crime only). This is apples to oranges.
Taking this into account will not eliminate the difference, but it's a much smaller difference. Further, the USA does have a much more aggressive drug policy and that leads to its majority of gun related crime.
Further evidence of how much nonsense is being used as arguments in this debate is suicide. Firearms make it easier to kill yourself, but suicide rates are higher in places like France than in the USA.

A little too positive on volatility. Having merchants cash out of bitcoin on every transaction, for one, is not the most efficient way to perform a bitcoin transaction. There's a middleman after all, and then it still involves the old, archaic financial system.
Secondly, if merchants don't keep bitcoins, they won't pay anyone in bitcoins - not employees, not vendors. This is the biggest hurdle to adoption besides volatility IMO, because overcoming this is what is going to lead people to earn bitcoins, rather than buy them, which incurs a fee. 
As far as trading and speculation points, sure, they are probably helping us, particularly speculators who mop up the liquidity released in the market by miners every day. 
In the end, I believe volatility will only decrease significantly when the money supply grows annually in the single digits. Because of this, we've got years ahead of us to build and improve bitcoin before mass adoption. IIRC, single digit inflation will only occur in 2021.

Capital Requirements are a rule, fractional reserve most certainly is not. Capital ratio requirement rules are not a prerequesite for fractional reserve to exist. This system has existed long before capital requirement rules existed. 
I will reiterate one more time: ALL lending must come from savings. There is no such thing as lending something that doesn't exist. In a FRBS, somebody's savings is loaned out multiple times. It does not in any way mean that there is no savings at all.

*Identity theft and other forms of fraud are a serious hassle for consumers, as well.
*Cash and bitcoin don't have to be carried in large quantities everywhere you go. Limit exposure, limit risk.
*Slicing and dicing bitcoin will be far better than the current system. Not only is it one ledger for everybody, but you can solve the problem of receipts that aggregate very different products that don't get split by product category. This can be done within wallets (but hasn't yet).

Also, I can make several counter arguments about some of the benefits you described. You think counting cash is a hassle? Well, try keeping a lookout for identity theft. 
Slicing and deciding spending habits should be even better with bitcoin, given that it's one ledger, rather than one (or more) for your checking, probably a couple for credit cards, etc. I guess you can consolidate with services like Mint.com, but at the expense of exposing yourself to hackers.

I was there too, and I know the story is completely different than what you say. FHC opened up the economy and prices stabilized. It used to cost as much as a small car to get land line service in São Paulo, and and a shitty service at that. And who knows how many months you had to wait to actually get that stuff installed. My parents moved in the mid 90s and actually included the land line in the f'ing mortgage. FHC privatized that sector and prices collapsed, increasing access to millions of people. That's not to say anything of the amazing accomplishment of kicking hyperinflation to the curb after what, two decades?
Lula would have NEVER done these structural reforms and many others that were accomplished during that time. His ideological beliefs would have never been in favor of it, and without them, there isn't a chance we would have seen the growth we saw in the first 10 years of the 2000s. We'd be stuck in a Venezuela-like quagmire.
The only decent thing Lula did was move away from his hard core beliefs, which is the only reason he got elected in the first place. Yes FHC had a crisis at the end of his term, but it PALES in comparison with his accomplishments. At best, Lula was a complete waste of time and that's giving him a huge pass on a lot of things.

Lula only gets credit for not changing back what FHC accomplished. Lula was a complete waste of time, at best; at worse he started the economic mess we're in now.

This is the reply made by a poster names Erica to Kaspeskas' post:
"Nice insight. I have to respectfully disagree with the promotion of a global currency. Having different currencies because different countries exist is the “cost” of doing business. As an American, my values and culture are different from other countries. I don’t want my self-interests and freedom to be manipulated by the banking industry because they are trying to reduce the costs of doing business. There are too many violent and unnecessary conflicts around the world. Why doesn’t the banking industry promote and pour resources into efforts that promote peace? Why doesn’t the banking industry promote and pour resources into Institutions that promote, advocate, and train on conflict resolution, peace building activities, and the elimination of violence? Why doesn’t the banking and financial industry promote and pour resources into a business model the measures success on people, sustainability, and profit? Thumbs down for global currency. Too much risk. Too much vulnerability. The cost to maintain, implement, and manage is too expensive. Too much risk for fraud and corruption. No accountability. If it were implemented, the people around the world who fall in the 90 percentile of the least amount of economic resources would pay for the cost of the system implementation. Really? Do I want to drink clean water and eat today or do I want to pay for a global currency system to be put in place?"

Gold was always a ledger system and you could have instant transactions using this ledger.

Because the money supply doesn't actually grow. That's why it's an effect. It grows IN EFFECT through lending of the same savings multiple times. You can have FRB in a gold standard, and obviously the money supply can only grow in effect, not in actuality.
Even with a reserve requirement of zero you absolutely would need savings to make loans. You can't just start a loan business with no money.
Reserves are a limit on FRB, some of it comes from savings, some come from the effective growth in money supply, that is, the virtual money that is created. Virtual = in effect.

Don't blame me, what I said is what the anti-gold crowd also says. And I was speaking about several decades ago, when gold was used as a currency. 
And there is nothing highly inflationary about gold. It's minimally inflationary. It's history is proof of this. Of course, it's possible someone might find a massive amount of gold somewhere on this earth (highly unlikely) and gold in the universe is a possibility, but very likely a very distant concern. But hey, bitcoin is a solution to that.
And don't worry about bitcoin's money supply. You can easily increase it but subdividing bitcoin further, the only difference is that you  get to keep the additional subdivisions, rather than bailing out the cheaters of the world.

Why would you not lend 5 bitcoins worth $1000 if you're gonna be paid back 5 bitcoins worth $1,100 + interest?
The question is not whether lending makes sense, but rather whether borrowing makes sense. I'd argue that if lending exists in an inflationary economy, borrowing can exist in a deflationary economy.

Wrong again you little fuck.
One of the age old characteristics of money is the characteristic of wealth storage. You don't have a fucking clue what is meant by this. When people save money it does not mean people hoard currency and just sit on it, you fuckwit. It means people make investments - they make loans, buy bonds, certificate of deposits, etc, etc, etc. ALL THESE INTEREST-YIELDING TYPES OF ASSETS WILL LOSE VALUE BECAUSE OF INFLATION. The currency that was used to purchase these bonds, to make these loans, will now be used by other individuals and companies to make all kinds of transactions. IN OTHER FUCKING WORDS, the currency is NOT BEING SAT ON!!!!!

Aside from you confusing lenders/borrowers and who benefits from inflation and who benefits from deflation, you keep bringing up "reality" as if your "real world example" proves your point:
10-yr loans and 2%? In real terms, that's nothing, assuming you even make any money - more than likely it's gonna be a negative interest rate. So your example doesn't really support your arguments. Heck, even in nominal terms it's pretty pathetic.
And while you attempt to guess what inflation rates will do over that 10-yr time frame, let's look at an additional benefit to the lender/lending market: the fact that deflation is an incentive to the early repayment of debt. 
This has time value of money implications favorable to the lender. It also means it's no longer a stupid move for the borrower who wants to get out ASAP from under, say, a mortgage.

Only certain types of assets protect you against inflation.
Monied people often own a lot of assets that do have inflation-protection characteristics not because they are seeking inflation-protection, but because they have a lot of money and don't mind the higher risks involved in those assets. 
The average retired person needs to have his or her investments in low risk assets, like bonds, a type of asset that WILL NOT protect you against inflation. Bonds are a type of asset whose value is entirely dependent on the value of the underlying currency. If the USD goes to shit, so do bonds.

That was just an example. You can substitute whatever rate you prefer, it makes no difference.

Bitcoin is designed to have zero inflation AND zero deflation. This is by design. 
In effect, there may be some minimal deflation. It will be insignificant for sure, as it depends on people losing bits here and there. I doubt borrowers would care even if they were dealing with a long-term loan.
