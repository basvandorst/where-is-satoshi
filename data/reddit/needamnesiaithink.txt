Pretty sure it’s still your fucking money until they can prove you were buying crack or bought crack.

Invest more, can also lose more

If you’re investing long term it won’t matter either way. But trying to make a quick flip sure.

How do you explain to your parents, that after all these years, you actually have autism? Just playing bro, you’ll recover.

Thanks for the insight sir

Hold and don’t sell it until the coin is worth more than you paid. Do not panic sell. That’s logically the only path to make out on this.

They’re paying out in the fiat value of the bitcoin at the time of the crash I believe.

Holy shit just saw this... and bought bitcoin within 2 minutes ( no money even in my account yet). Quickly transferred 25.00, fee was only .31.... game changer

Trading and economy dates back thousands of years. Even within small communities people barter and trade and that's "economy". It's a must or you die out.

You have to have an economy to grow or even maintain some sort of a decent life. Long term no debt would be bad. And honestly I don't think it can happen. There has always been debt and there will always be debt until we all cease to exist

There’s probably a lot of applications right now
