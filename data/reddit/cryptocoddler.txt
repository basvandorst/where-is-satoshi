We are just now testing that hidden support level, which we haven't tested in a while.    
Never have we gone below it. Trend reversal is coming soon, very soon.

The number of unique wallet addresses is still doubling every year. Ten million new unique wallet addresses will join by the end of the year. There is a huge reversal signal on the RSI \(divergence\) indicating BTC is about to enter a upward trend. The rate of new wallet users is now coming back to baseline from it's big bump back in December. Looks good.

After 30+ years of reading charts, I can tell you with certainty that a new dinosaur will start growing out of the other one after his tongue forms.

This post applies to both of those things. Boo, hiss.

I've got a really nice image coming up for you. Have yet to see it.

Over the long term I think it's going to be harder to manipulate considering the number of unique wallet addresses is doubling every year. This has been a reliable constant since the beginning. 10MM new unique wallets will be added by the end of this year. By the end of 2019 there will be 80MM unique wallets. This is directly tied to the overall price trend since the beginning, which has been upward overall.

Really? I'm going to have to read more about it. I was under the impression that as long as you reinvest gains within 180 days, you can avoid paying taxes on them.

Is anybody going to check this out or what?
