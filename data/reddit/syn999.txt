 even they really ban the exchanges, only drive trading underground like China. gl with tracking and collecting tax. Korea

if u dont make a profit(sell for a gain) u dont pay 
@_date: 2018-01-29 04:40:25
its ok to keep in legacy. if u wanna send to segwit, just send regulatory like any other transaction. segwit is bit cheaper than legacy and needed for LN

say  current 20exah hashrate. new block every 10 mins if hash maintain same .When btc readjust the diff. block will be found on average 10 mins. but lets say 50% of hash leave and only 10 exahash left on bitcoin network. network going to slow down and find new blocks until next adjustment.

BITCoin has only 20b market atm, which doesn't mean much to a major govt economy. and plenty ppl use vpn to get across fire wall. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 18:42:11
question: how much fee and how long it took to confirm? or they dont care confirmation? 
@_date: 2017-01-19 16:56:55
u live in a green energy country, u use green energy. 2 much cost if you build you own
@_date: 2017-01-23 19:32:17
point of vpn is to avoiding govt firewall. Its illegal anyway in eyes of govt

FYI, most chinese (cant get out china) dont use it as a way to get out capital control. Chinese ppl lovs to invest their money into something. (stocks, real estate, some flowers????) but only few wins and most jump off building. specially when there is no fee when trade.

@_date: 2017-11-16 05:32:11
I am not sure about the answer but i would compare ripple blockchain. they got all coins premined and the chain is private. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
would imagine IBM neither use something like ETH or make their own

Yes and no.
at that block, you tech have both coins. But its up to you wallet provider to offer both coin for trading.
if you wallet provider found secure way to spilt the coins and u should be safe to trade.
 better check with them first.

@_date: 2017-11-14 22:23:19
one way if u see like that, or u can lose a lot hashrate and network goes worse than last weekend. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:39:27
hopfull bitcoin price goes up and fee going to be enough for miners to make profit 
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:22:11
couple reasons can cause this. you can google empty bitcoin blocks and there will be different explanations. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:17:26
why would u send it 
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:12:40

i dont mean peasants of the system. i meant from everyone.
The bitcoin system wouldnt work without miners (majority on one side and profit driving). it wouldnt work without real developers (clearly b2x, BU sux ass, most likely same ones for bcash) it also wouldnt work without the peasants (user base)

dont think big block is bad, it was just not consensed between miners, ceo, core and community. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:44:26
easiest explanation to me is bitmain asicminer cant do segwit and that means lose of millions each day.

easier mean more ppl going to mine bitcoin which make more blocks produced.
if no adjust difficult then this goign to cause new bitcoin run out way faster. also short term infaltion.

@_date: 2017-11-01 21:36:44

@_date: 2017-11-30 06:54:47
Blockchain ok samurai awesome
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:38:24
when the fork started and people able to trade. you can expect big price moment on both coins. b2x might go up or down, so is btc 
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:26:25
as far as i see, closer to fork, price up higher
after fork , see a correction
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:56:13

@_date: 2017-11-10 06:48:05
anyone can fork b2x and mostly likely its going to happen, but without developers or major support(big heads)
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:39:24
they both work, but i prefer on ledger 
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:54:40
pretty sure even new coinbase customer has $7500 limit. unless you have cc.
u can try gemini
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:53:26
ledger website. they base in France should be easier for you 
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:28:36
ofc it can crash, depends when you step aside

@_date: 2017-11-03 05:04:47
some does same as regular customers thought coinbase/ gemini.
they got auction/wire trasnfer/businese accounts 
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:52:10
why u have to use coinbase 
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:41:02
like last weekend 
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:14:43

segwit2x is not gone, just delay for now. it can still happen by small group of miner or later. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:51:49
We wanted to remind you that the upcoming Bitcoin Segwit2x fork is projected to take place on November 16 and will result in 2 bitcoin blockchains. 
In our effort to make Coinbase the most trusted, safe, and easy-to-use digital currency exchange, we are working to ensure we maximize your benefit from this event. So, following the fork: 
Any user storing Bitcoin on Coinbase at the time of the fork will be credited with an equal amount of the new Bitcoin2x asset on the Bitcoin2x blockchain. No action is required - we will automatically credit your account. If you have 5 Bitcoin stored on Coinbase before the fork, you will have 5 Bitcoin and 5 Bitcoin2x following the event.
Coinbase users will be able to trade both Bitcoin and Bitcoin2x shortly after the fork.
Coinbase will disable buys, sells, sends and receives for Bitcoin and Bitcoin2x approximately 24 hours before the fork. We will re-enable them following the fork once it’s safe to do so.
For a detailed timeline of events surrounding the fork please see our blog post and FAQ. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:29:47
its not "when should I spilt"
after the certain block, you wallet should spilt for you.
if you dont do anything is the safest way.
if you use 3rd party to store you bitcoin (like coinbase) and they announce both coins trading
its safe to sell/trade thought them
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:18:41
 ¯\_(ツ)_/¯, since no competitors, monopoly for the win 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:01:28
this is good for bitcoin, building support
