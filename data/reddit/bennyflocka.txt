I thought if your coins are stored on the coinbase exchange then they have your private keys not you, so you don't benefit from the forks (was this even a fork)?

For someone brand new I’d say coinbase. Very easy interface. Eventually move your coins off the exchange to a wallet, but it’s a solid place to dip your toe into the crypto market!

There’s your motivation lol. Either you believe in bitcoin or you want to make a quick buck! 
@_date: 2018-08-30 11:38:57
The phrase “cash cushion” alone means that’s money you can afford to lose. Unfortunately most people  don’t have that. 
Simply put, don’t invest your rent payment, dont refinance your house to invest that money don’t skip a car payment or a student loan payment or money that you set aside for your kids college fund.

@_date: 2018-08-13 17:44:05
Listen, I really hope you’re right and there are answers to my questions as I’m currently a BTC and alt bag holder, lol. I’ll be the first to admit that I got into the market in mid October right before the boom, and was apart of the euphoria of Q4 2017. Now that we’re far removed from the high, I want to hear from those more knowledgeable than me on how this overtakes fiat. 
The argument of “BTC will thrive when USD crashes” doesn’t hold much water to me because people in Zimbabwe, Chile and Turkey aren’t exactly BTC adopters even though all of their government based money crashed. The chicken or the egg conundrum of “store of value vs usable currency” will always be a question until it isn’t anymore, and short of “institutional entry” (which we’ve been saying for 8 months now) I don’t know what will excite the market enough to drive the price back up. 
Luckily I didn’t invest more than I was willing to lose, and somehow my overall portfolio is up this year even with massive Crypto losses. I still want to believe in crypto and want it to win, I just can’t see any of the answers people give me being the correct ones. 
Like your first example for instance: it doesn’t make sense to me because you’re comparing a product that grew in popularity to a currency. Smartphones were obvious upgrades over their predecessors, and once consumers experienced them, there was no turning back. There are millions of ppl that have some amount of crypto, but still use fiat daily. People in 2010 didn’t have both cell phones, they only used one thus mass adoption. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 16:22:43
?? That doesn’t make much sense to me. Merchants have bills too. Why would they accept something just because others are holding it, when the actual value hasn’t changed?
If I own a tire shop, I’m not going to accept BTC because people online are posting their cold wallets. If I can’t flip that BTC into paying for utilities at my shop, or paying down the loan on the building etc I’m effectively losing money.

Why not spend now if you’ll never sell? 
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:35:33
Then buy back in when you see the reversal trend. 
Lol you say it like btc would suddenly go from $2k to $20k in minutes. People (like me) that sold their stack before it got to these levels will have more than enough time to get back in once you see the trend pointing up.
I had to learn the hard way that HODL is a fools game, and it’s what caused some people to not sell at 13k, 12k, 10k, 8k hell even 6k lmao. It was a great lesson to learn in my mid 20s with a couple thousand bucks though. Way better than a life savings play in my 40s 
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:08:58
I’d much rather be the 400k guy than the “HODL so strangers on reddit respect me” guy. Congrats bro, hope to see you soon in that 400k+ circle 
@_date: 2018-11-19 22:14:44
I remember around this time last year people were telling me Lightning network going live would send BTC to 50k on here lmao. And you were an idiot in the eyes of the average 18 y/o Reddit user if you said futures opening up was a terrible thing for bitcoin. 
Now we're still relying on "institutional investors" to raise the price of the technology who's goal it is to destabilize the institutions? I'm bearish on BTC until we as a community come up with a better answer than "the price will rise because of institutional investors". The whole point was to take the power from those shops, not pray those shops help us with our bags!

@_date: 2018-11-25 02:21:27
No coiners commenting on Reddit threads doesn’t do shit to the price. 
Stop trying to rationalize why it’s falling. If you believe in BTC keep investing, if not then bail on it and use this timeframe as a life lesson. Either way, trying to police a bunch of strangers comments on reddit threads is only going to drive you crazy. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 02:52:45
Not everyone on reddit is a nice guy that’s happy to see others own btc. Some look for people that tell you how much they own so they can target the owner.

@_date: 2018-03-07 22:05:57
It was a reach of an example. 
I don’t think Binance, Bitrrex etc can do anything that would raise the price of BTC. If you’re referring to the Binance issues today and blame that for the drop in price, that’s also misguided. 
Blame the investors for succumbing to news that means nothing in the grand scheme of things.
Exchanges aren’t like central banks. They have power, but no where near that level.

you sound like the guy that was saying this at 13k, and then 10k, and definitely 8k, and even 6k.. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:11:34
To continue your analogy I think the people that are voicing their anger on Reddit are the ones that would’ve bought in at 80k and watched it go to 50 lol. They don’t care about the guys that have been in since $3k and are still profiting.
That’s why they’re pissed on Reddit forums 
@_date: 2019-01-12 15:30:19
Well that’s vague, don’t you think? The “future” could be 2037 before the price goes back up over 20k, and the HODLers would still reserve the right to say “I told you so”? Lol 
@_date: 2018-02-15 01:54:20
Friends told me in college around 2012. Didn’t actually invest until about a year ago. 
Wasn’t fully convinced it wasn’t a major con-job. Some say I’m and idiot for not investing when I first heard about it, but I was a broke college student and that money would’ve been crucial to my livelihood haha.

@_date: 2018-11-19 18:53:57
I disagree. I think it's completely valid to hear "smart people see this as a buying opportunity" and question why someone thinks that. Especially after you've heard the same comments at 13k, 10k, 8k, 7k, and 6k lol. What makes 5k different? 
That's the question I'm referring to. Not predicting price.

I don’t think the world economy will ever be 100% crypto. The more I’ve been in the space and research I think the “BTC as Gold, XMR as Swiss bank accounts and platform coins for building projects” crowd are correct. I can see this being the use case moving forward for the top coins.

You’re hitting me with the classic “market price doesn’t mean anything” “if 5 people have 1 and 4 don’t sell” arguments that we’ve both heard a ton. 
I understand all of that lol. I’m a BTC bull in the long term once the technology gets to a point where it’s useable mainstream. Until then it’s speculation. And I think a lot of the speculators (short term) are afraid thanks to the beginning of 2018. I hear it when I talk to my casual investing friends. They don’t believe in crypto at the moment.

You could’ve posted this EXACT post with different numbers last month, 5 months ago or 8 months ago. 
No one knows a thing about price except it went up all last year, and it went down all of this year. If those 8 year bitcoiners were clairvoyants, they would’ve sold their coins at 20k into tether or fiat and have been shorting the way down.
