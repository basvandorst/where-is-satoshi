Hello agian,
I have gotten your reward, and i have some more feedback.
* A block explore link would be a nice addition to the transaction history.
*  Numbers of confirmations on the transaction.
* If you try to send bitcoins, you can't see your total bitcoins.
* If you send bitcoins, the shade of green is another shade. This makes the wallet look unfinished. Using the wallet for some time, the green color makes it look boring.
* If you click the refresh button, it freeze the app. It spins, but you can't see it, because the app freeze.
Thanks for the reward.

Here are some feedback.
* PIN is only numbers, the numpad is the only thing that works for this. I'm on a ipad so i don't know if it works on the phone. This also goes for the webwallet. Show a small numpad. I don't care where it is.
* Replace the setting logo with a arrow or 3 lines. It has nothing with settings to do.
* The logo, it's ugly get a more clear one. I don't mean the design but the fact that it's like scaled to match what every size the app logo needed to be. If you hire a designer, tell him you want a [vector image](
* Make a "?" icon, that displays some help, like where to change currency. I like hidden features like how you can change the wallet amount between local currency and BTC, but features like local currency should not be a hidden feature, i spent a long time searching for this and was suggesting adding a local currency feature.
* Refresh button? It should update every 10 sec, if you need to scan the blockchain agian make a setting somewhere else for that. If you really want that refresh button, make it flash if you hit it.
* Somewhere to change the BTC unit, MBTC, satoshi...
* Change Tokens to Features, with a calculator and a price graf and Litecoin.
* Output the secret phrase in a qr code. Make the web wallet able to import the code from a jpg, png...
* Default bitcoin fee setting is missing!
* Going between Litecoin and Bitcoin, have a arrow back at the PIN windows if you hit it and want to go back.
* If you want the users to make a username make them enter a password so they can go to a watch mode.
* Why can i swipe the wallet interface up or down? 
* Sending to a  when you are done typing a address you need to translate it into a real bitcoin address. I don't know if this is possible.
* How long can verifying a PIN take, bitcoin wallets need to be faster then a credit card.
* Sometimes if you have been browsing a lot in it i if that it get stuck. After 30 secs or it works agian?
* Some animations, i must really say it's kinda boring. I want to swipe across the window of my wallet not click on buttons. Make the menu pop down if you swipe down. The menu has nothing to do on my home screen.
* 2FA, one of the most important parts of bitcoin is missing.
* Web wallet problem 
I have no bitcoins to send from this wallet and back, so i can't check features related to "bitcoin". If you want me to test that send the bitcoins to frilledfish

Look at your [link]( 1 more time.
Also "lol" isn't a way to prove a person wrong. It only makes you look like a idiot. Try harder next time.

You think 30 days is a small time frame? It was around 30 to 80 days ago the problem started. You can also change it to [60 days with 7 days average]( still no improvement. You can also change it to 180 days, now you will be able to see that the network **was** growing, but stopped around December.

If you want to buy more bitcoin after your first order, you should try a exchange or Coinbase.
If you want to skip on the id thing, circle has option to buy with creditcard without id.
Most places support small orders, but will include a higher fee.

The miner that puts it into a block.

Every transaction is stored on the blockchain as a row of names, so yes.
If you have 25 BTC (Current reward) you have a full 25 BTC, when you send 13 BTC, you create a transaction with 25 BTC. The transaction you just created have 2 outputs, one for your friend and 1 for you. The 13 BTC get pointed towards your friends address and 21 BTC get pointed towards your address.
I'm not 100% sure about this, so don't quote me on it.

If Alice mines a block, Alice will get credited X bitcoin (X is current block reward, lets say X = 25). 25 bitcoins is now deposited in Alice's name, aka address, and she can spend those 25 bitcoins on whatever she wants. If Alice wants to send 1 bitcoin to James, she will tell the blockchain, that she had 25 bitcoins and wants 1 bitcoin to be placed in James name, we now have a path that looks like, Alice -&gt; James. If James sends that bitcoin to Nick, he tells the blockchain that he will send the bitcoin he got from Alice to Nick. Path looks like Alice -&gt; James -&gt; Nick. If Nick sends that to someone he will add that persons name to the bitcoin, Alice -&gt; James -&gt; Nick -&gt; Someone.
TL:DR, a bitcoin is a string of transactions.

Thanks for your tip, may I ask, why you are emptying your ChangeTip account?
@_date: 2015-11-09 13:46:03
Localbitcoins would be your best bet, but if you can't find anyone on there i might be able to sell some
@_date: 2015-11-11 17:59:47
How many bitcoins do you have in your ChangeTip account?

Hello, this was me sending you the message.
I don't see the problem with holding YOUR Bitcoins in YOUR wallet. You will never have to move them out. If this isn't riskless, I don't know what is.
You just need to make sure you can sign a message from the wallet. You can store them in Trezor, Electrum, Bitcoin Core and many other wallets.
If anyone else wanna get the opportunity, you can send me a message.
You can take what you want from this. You only have to keep your Bitcoins in your wallet on the 7'Aug on the most popular chain. You can always move them, but it means you are not entitled to the interest.
