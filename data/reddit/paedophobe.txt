So I'm America there's a law called civil forfeiture.
  (long, quality, and funny)
 (short)
So a cop can take your money and you have to prove it innocent. If you have 10k in cash because you're old school and like money under your bed they can take your money because they think it's drug money and they want to take your funds to hinder crime.
And privacy shouldn't be condemned. It's natural human behavior. Do you leave your curtains open and would you let us look at your browsing history, etc. Saying you don't care about privacy because you don't have anything to hide is like saying you don't care about freedom of speech beause you have nothing to say.
Bitcoin helps you take control of your funds and it's easier to prove it's innocence.
@_date: 2018-08-17 04:03:09
You should make a video of why centralization of miners doesn't mean centralization of Bitcoin. And why pow is the only trustless consensus mechanism. And why work must be done/"wasted". And why the base layer faces the trillema and how shitcoins give up decentralization for scalability. It would be nice to link to your video when debating my altcoin friends.

I mean someone accepted tether for Bitcoin. Like if you accepted a schekle for a dollar. The lost is on the person who holds tethers. 
I just don't get why tethers needs to exists in the first place. A crytocurrency pegged to dollars. Why not just say dollars when you get dollars in. Or when you get the dollars you use Bitcoin? Seems like a way for bitfinex to buy Bitcoin from other exchanges using fake money.

But with an open source documented phone you don't have to trust Google either. You can change email default to protonmail. You can verify the build yourself, remove play store and use the fdroid store which only has Foss apps. You can also route all network through tor. If you really care about privacy and not having to trust a company Android is better imo. And all major companies are a surveillance apparatus, apple included. What you're referring to is apple not giving up the encrypted volume of the iPhone and all modern Android's have encrypted as well. Google can't give the government our passwords any more than apple can.
In fact apple is worse. You don't truly own your device because you can't change the software nor audit it/have others audit it.  Would you be okay trusting apple with the Bitcoin reference client code?

Decision makers? Miners don't control the chain. See segwit2x and bcash. Besides nano is more like Fiat but with less regulations. Digital create money out of thin air- check. Have richest entities validate the ledger- check. Nano might work for a central bank and it's systems, but Bitcoin will win out for being the more strong currency

I answer all support messages sent to me, if you actually send it to me and not a phishing site. You can all register and send me a message if you like to try. 
All deposit addresses on Blender are segwit now and start with a 3 since two months, you can also verify that the displayed addresses are correct by getting and verifying the "Proof of Ownership" PGP message obtainable from the deposit page, it contains your username and your deposit addresses signed by my PGP key. 
If you want to prove i am a scam (which no one yet has done) you can use the quickmix option and save the PGP signed "Bitcoin Blender Guarantee". It contains the deposit address you are supposed to send your coins to and the destination address you specified, all signed by my PGP key. If i do not deliver new coins to your destination address you can post this PGP message and anyone can verify its signature and check the blockchain if the coins was sent or not.

Gold's price has more to do with it's perceived store of value than its usefulness. Copper is a more used metal than gold yet it doesn't have the same valuation. If gold's was strictly priced for its uses than it would be priced less than copper.
Also its better in multiple ways than traditional money. There's no central control. Go ahead and try to online gamble (ones with better provable odds than legal ones in Vegas), buy cheaper prescriptions from another country, support WikiLeaks, buy black market shit like (bubblgum in Singapore) without your account getting shut down, or try to buy marijuana at a dispensary as a valid medicinal patient. If it's truly your money then you can send it to whoever you want; you worked for it. Even if you don't do any of those things the fact that someone else can freeze your account means you have a claim to your money, which can always be taken away. 
Try to organize a run on the bank day. Just to see if they will return our money. We can put it back in the bank once everyone has gotten their money. 
Also try carrying more than $15,000 across country borders. Or go ahead and flaunt $15,000+ in cash at a cop. He can charge your money with a crime and it will be up to you to prove it innocent. If you get pulled over for going 46 mph in a 45 mph zone a cop can pull you over, see your cash and take it. 
I probably won't convince you and it's okay.  If you don't get it or need it then you shouldn't adopt it. Please don't buy it as a way to get more dollars. And tell everyone you know not to do the same. Yeah guys I'm that bullish that you can try to fud Bitcoin and I believe it still won't die. Don't see it as a way to get more fiat, but compared to fiat it's a good way to preserve wealth. I don't want to invest in shit to beat inflation. I'm simple and rather just save money for things I want. Not short term like 1 or 2 years, but saving for my entire life. Or preserve wealth for my family line where we can pass down Bitcoin private keys as an heirloom. Honestly that's why I'm stingy as fuck and have always paid 1 sat/byte fees and wish I can go lower. Yeah I want to past down Satoshis to my great great great great great grandkids. If miners past the year 2140 are mining for Satoshis then fuck yeah I'm hodling Satoshis.
  
Im pretty sure that other Bitcoin maximalists think alike and we see that Bitcoin will be the one global currency. We're betting on Bitcoin becoming the most fair and free form of currency for the rest of mankind. It's sort of like this decentralized social experiment to see if total strangers can agree to do something right. If you don't want to get it and still don't, you don't have to participate in this experiment with us. If Bitcoin really does become the one currency you can just convert then. No biggie. There's obviously no central authority like the IRS demanding you adopt it.

My only "TA" is that fiat has no cap and by it's debt creation design it must always increase it's cap. Of course over time hard money would be valued more. But bitcoins entire marketcap is 1/10th of apples marketcap. The .01% can of course manipulate the fiat to Bitcoin ratio.

One 15 second block is not as secure as one  bitcoin 10 minute block. You have to look at how much it costs to revert one block. I still don't see much as a game changer. Digiid can be done with any cryptography? Trezor has u2f authentication using Bitcoin private keys. 
What's digishield and how does the chain choose which mining algorithm is picked for the next block?

No it's mining profitability. Miners make more by spending less electricity. Mining is competitive and places with low electricity costs (surplus production) or free cooling would help a miner more than adding hashrate.

No dude. Decentralization means there's not one single point to attack the network. Having many blockchains do the same thing is just diluting the main appeal, digital scarcity. There's an opportunity cost with owning two cryptocurrencies. When one has a better advantage initially it will have a feedback loop to prefer the better one.

Well technically if you're not using a node, mining or non mining, you're not a peer in the Bitcoin network. But once you start using your node there's no one stopping you from making a transaction. If you pay the minimum fee it will get picked up.

@_date: 2018-08-15 23:25:45
If you sync your own node you don't have to ask for permission. Add in the highest transaction fee and your transaction will to through. Or if you are a miner yourself, which you don't have to ask permission to be one, go mine a block with your transaction in it.
@_date: 2018-08-04 14:51:40
Uh but with the responsibility of giving you back a new cash note you must also trust them not to print an extra million dollars a second... No thanks.

No. And that would also be an attack vector for any government that doesn't want competition to their money printing: Use money they printed to build Asics. Recklessly add hashrate to increase difficulty. Short 100x-200x on those derivative exchanges. Turn off miners. 
The truth will be that while they are setting up Asics, they realize that the difficulty adjustment can also adjust down. And that they would best profit by actually earning Bitcoin by using their energy to finding blocks.

But there's no need to pay a fee if all transactions were zero fees and can still make it into a block. The incentive sturcture doesn't work with unlimited block sizes. And if a fee is required, the minimum fee can be paid and you can have os backups forever stored by other people.

Where can we see which version of Bitcoin core is the most popular?
@_date: 2018-08-29 05:43:01
Nano made all the coins at once. Digitally and out of thin air. And then had to distribute them through captchas. We can't know for sure if the developer actually sent someone the nano and we have to trust  him to not keep any for himself. And bitcoin is fair. Satoshi had it so that if you wanted a Bitcoin just run the Bitcoin client. Even though Satoshi mined, he had to still prove that work was expended. Anyone can hash, not efficient without an asic. One can use a pen and paper to produce a hash every 3 days. It's akin to having a shovel vs an industrial drill to find gold. Both still have to expend a finite resource, time or energy, to produce a Bitcoin.
All the tokens of nano was made all at once at the start. Poof. Akin to digitally creating money for free.

I'm pretty sure I'm running a full node. but if I'm understanding correctly, it is even better to use the full node as a wallet over electrum or mycelium as those wallets don't verify the transactions fully? Are there wallets that I can sync to my own full node?
@_date: 2017-08-23 20:58:22
Yup, you guys don't need to trust that the developer working on your alt is competent!
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:58:39
But like is it that easy? Or would we lose our Bitcoin as well?
@_date: 2017-08-20 05:01:50
GitHub repo of Bitcoin core would be better than bcash
@_date: 2017-08-20 01:10:15
Oh but it's different for miners who want to cash out the bcash from a block reward. It takes 100 confirmations.
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:45:28
No he's saying buy and hold. Wait to sell when a coin is 10,000+ or the day transactions are all in bitcoin. Much reading you must, young Padawan.
@_date: 2017-08-20 00:20:09
No miners are jumping. Hashrate increased for Bitcoin and even being 67% more profitable to mine bcash the hashrate of bcash has stayed the same. I guess miners are worried their mined bcash coin will be dumped and price will drop before their 100 confirmations needed to withdraw bcash.
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:52:57
If people value fast transaction times and a central authority to trust the ledger, they can use VISA.
@_date: 2017-08-20 01:18:07
I'm not going to upgrade my node because miners want to not mine.
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:58:23
At least in America, there is so much inflation from the federal reserve overprinting money that it makes more sense hodling in Bitcoin than in dollars.
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:38:33
Hmm if we allowed trolls would the price lower even more for us?
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:20:11
Smaller miners don't have access to the tech can't compete with bigger miners which lead to centralization

his master Roger Ver needs people to not sell so he can pump first
@_date: 2017-08-22 00:39:57
I'm still confused why it is better to use a full node as a wallet and not just as a notary.
@_date: 2017-08-19 03:02:20
better than hodling fiat.
@_date: 2017-08-20 00:45:23
Low fees, fast transactions, big blocks leading to centralization of nodes = a shittier PayPal.
@_date: 2017-08-20 00:17:10
It will go to zero eventually when coinbase gives bcash back to their customers
@_date: 2017-08-20 00:06:06
That's still kind of shitty. Like with Bitcoin, in a year, 1 btc is 1 btc. With USD your money is 98% of what it once was.
@_date: 2017-08-20 02:16:24
Roger could be pumping his bcash from his massive stash prefork bitcoin into his own exchange.

what's to stop pirates from broadcasting torrent movies on the block chain? and how would a user say want to watch leaked game of thrones from it? so whoever is mining at a loss is like hosting the video for all to watch? sounds like a cool idea if I'm understanding correctly.

@_date: 2017-08-18 13:56:40
ATM I started running a full node a week ago and am still 1 year behind the block chain. And that is at 1 mb cap of core. and I have FiOS. If you want to trust someone else to validate a ledger with low fees you should use PayPal. Sorry if I sound aggressive it's because I hate to think how long it would take if the blocksize increased.
@_date: 2017-08-19 02:28:48

They think they are doing us a favor? Society will evolve with or without them. It's like the internet. Sooner or later the world changes. We are doing them a favor for exchanging Fiat for Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-09-10 08:38:25
It can crash to zero usd but the technology is still sound. The Bitcoin you own are still  yours. We need a currency and store of value that is decentralized and trustless. Eventually even in 20 or 100 years Bitcoin will bounce back.  I mean what's the difference between Satoshi selling all his Bitcoin and someone who's rich and accumulated a majority of Bitcoin later starts to sell? They both will tank the value, in USD, short term but Bitcoin will continue to work long term.
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:42:06
Thank you for your service.

Ugh let's give in to big business because they are so annoying.. /s
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:55:58
I'm trying to say that proof of stake is inherently flawed. It doesn't work unless it is centralized. I'm just saying the current monetary policy uses fractional reserve banking to create money to fund wars. Nothing wrong with capitalism but it does promote profits for decisions that compromise the environment.
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:07:34
Sure. But if they sold all and Bitcoin went to zero then it would go up again eventually. Whale can fluctuate the price but can bring Bitcoin down forever
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:27:28
Bitcoins are safe for the average user. Has less fraud than current solutions but if said user loses his private keys they are gone forever.
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:57:33
Don't use for large amounts though!
@_date: 2017-09-02 10:07:43
Proof of stake doesn't work for when a new node comes online and has to decide which of two chains is the valid one
@_date: 2017-09-09 23:44:06
Just wondering, but does anyone know if Bitcoin could adopt monero or be more private with a hardfork? Or is the ability to read the ledger fundamental to Bitcoin and monero will exist for dark uses?
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:04:52
Better them not giving you a compromised device than to take all of your Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-09-05 23:21:37
How can Bitcoin be protected from this attack vector? It seems since they can't attack the chain they can utilize external sources like this to bring it down?
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:40:10
Hmm time locks seem nice for giving Bitcoin to relatives that have weak hands and might sell.
@_date: 2017-09-28 11:24:09

@_date: 2017-09-05 23:36:34
Yeah can't we just send the amount to a new wallet and give the seed to the recipient?
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:22:22
Because of tethers? Or is that another bit named exchange?

A noob, but does that mean at the time segwit 2x is worth around 20 cents?
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:35:14
Take his cash and send him the private keys sometime in the future using futureme.org. rearrange the seed order and remember it/tell him. Get the public keys so he can send to that wallet. Get the xpub so he can import to a wallet and see his balance. You can also do this as a will to your loved ones.
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:55:52
But how will a new node know what the wrong chain is? Stakes will be lost but profit can be made if the double spend was greater. I like to think the environmental damage for mining cryptos is preferable to the damage of war and on the environment from capitalism and the current monetary policy.

In our current situation what's to stop rich people from buying mining farms, outcompete all miners when difficulty is so high that other miners still can't profit and just stop mining to hold the chain hostage? Game theory is we should just wait and have them burn money right? They should just learn in time?
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:39:08
It doesn't stop and shouldn't imo. Bitcoin wins by being proving to be resilient to attacks. Veterans know not to attack since it's a waste of money.
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:13:00
No users not miners. Miners follow users not the other way around. They can make a new crypto and put all of their hashrate behind it and it wont make it a valuable coin.

Wait but whoever is feeding the Oracle data can be manipulated? As in the act of real world variables being transcoded into the blockchain or several databases. You can have an aggregate of data but that is still an attack vector for someone about to lose it all to try and maximize his profits. As a skeptic, what's the usage of ark if Bitcoin can have sidechains to implement alt coin ideas and thus people would have no need for bridging to altcoins? Not attacking you just want to be clear on the utility of these altcoins you mention. I do get interested in altcoins and how they solve the same problems Bitcoin is facing.

Paper wallets from offline sources are more secure than hardware imo since you dont have to trust code (ledger not auitable) or trust the auditors (trezor open source but for those that cant audit). However, if you transact it's inconvenient compare to hardware wallets. Software wallets like electrum on tails os not even connected to the internet is more secure than a ledger imo but it is an annoyance to deal with two computers, one offline and one online, to make transactions.
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:38:31
Not a bad strategy. But if you took time to understand the underlying technology you can make more as the minority fork gets dumped.

@_date: 2017-10-16 02:32:26
It has been planned but to have a bug so closed to release day is worrisome for a $100 billion network. And you can always split coins using the ntimelock method. If 2x has majority hashrate it would be better since we can all dump our 2x coins fast for Bitcoin/an alt and then shapeshift to Bitcoin. The miners won't mine a chain whose token is worth less than Bitcoin. even if they love 2x, they can accrue even more 2x coins by mining Bitcoin and selling them to buy 2x coins. If they want to mine a network where they are they only ones on it then they lose money because no one wants their coins. I wouldn't upgrade to any core hard forks either as it's free to wait it out until the miners come back. It's not free for miners to waste energy. Even if backed by big businesses there is a point where they say fuck it, we have no more money to support your electricity bills/ investments. At the end of the day, the onus is on the hard fork to get users to upgrade, if not they are just playing by themselves. People are going to be fired for wasting investor's money.

Core roadmap does have an increase in blocksize but since it requires a hard fork they want to cram as many hard fork requiring features to have as few hard forks as possible. 2x is just rushed with buggy code as core developers recently found a bug in their replay protection. They are not production ready to have a viable network that is securing billions.

I guess both forks can live, but 2x has the same difficulty at a lower valued price so any miner would mine Bitcoin instead. If he really supports 2x he would have more 2x coins if he mined Bitcoin and bought 2x coins.

Question, from someone who uses paper wallet, why ledger over trezor? Looking at both and it seems trezor is better since it has open software and hardware and ledger has closed software for it's security element?

With ledger you never know if people can kidnap the developers kids and force him to inject malicious code.

But if I'm using Bitcoin before the fork won't I be using bitcoin after when I sync my wallet? It doesn't matter if they have more nodes if those nodes don't interact with us. I'm kind of conflicted.

Bad actors learn a very expensive lesson, Bitcoin proves resilience and price increases, and hodlers get an airdrop by [splitting their coins.]( However I'll start syncing now and block btc1 IP addresses to protect those who rely on spv clients.

@_date: 2017-09-08 19:00:10
So when there's a new node trying to connect to the network and two chains are being built, one a malicious one where a bad actor is trying to rewrite the block chain and the true chain. A system cannot fundamentally check which one is the right one. With proof of work, the revolutionary answer is external; the right chain is backed by the energy used to mine that chain. When logic has failed can a system logically prove it has failed? Google Proof of stake flawed. And the Byzantine general problem. Imo, the energy "wasted" on Bitcoin is worth over the destruction and costs that present day fiat/fractional reserve banking has done on the world.
 (PDF warning)
Ethereum is pretty centralized imo. I'm pretty biased (so do your research) but the days of apps that can't be stopped was over the moment Vitalik, a central actor, rolled back the chain rewriting history to prevent the DAO from running as it was intended by code. I'm pretty sure ethereum's proof of stake solution is a hybrid with proof of work and/or has a trusted notary to say THIS is the right chain. But the value of blockchains is that consensus between parties can be achieved without requiring an iota of trust from anyone. 
Not a cryptographer just an enthusiast, so correct me if I'm mistaken.

In essence you can still send Bitcoin by giving someone a number. How are they going to ban me giving someone a number? And how are governments going to stop me running a node with tor enabled? Governments can't stop Bitcoin, they haven't because they can't. It's like stopping the internet at this point. Only have way is to emp the entire world because all we need is at least one node and an asic for everyone to be able to transact. The u.s knows this and it's better to get fee money from coinbase than to have other countries adopt it first.

The only thing you can buy/do with Bitcoin and not fiat is gambling and drugs at the moment. Not bad since with Bitcoin you truly own what you can buy with it. But with greshams law you would do better accumulating Bitcoin and using Fiat until you run out. The spend and replace thing is weird since you are just using fiat in the end anyways. Sure it moves money around but if the merchant accepts both fiat and Bitcoin, you should use fiat while it still has value.

Transaction fees. And Bitcoin was secured the same way at $1 as it is now. Miners are incentivized to profit by being honest. They would rather earn Bitcoin than attack the system. Even more so now because the attacker must buy Asics which can only mine Bitcoin. They lose more attacking than just mining. At least with a cpu/gpu it can be used for other stuff after the attack is done.
@_date: 2018-07-28 17:46:24

Coordinator dictates which transaction is valid in double spend. That's like in Bitcoin only one node has final say which one is valid and which is the double spent transaction. Bitcoin has it so all nodes must agree. In iota a coordinator( master node) has final arbitration. Sounds like a PayPal situation if there's no true decentralization
@_date: 2018-07-25 07:38:14
Not really. There's no viable contender to dethrone Bitcoin that is as secure and decentralized.

Eh I don't think it's an upgrade. I won't upgrade my node. Also I'm pretty sure 2x would have 0 hashrate as no miner would mine a chain that has a lower valued token. And this is coming from a person who wants 2x to have hashpower after the fork so I can use ntimelock to split my coins and dump 2x coins for Bitcoin. Even if miners love 2x they would have more 2x coins by mining Bitcoin and buying 2x coins. But good luck with your fork.
@_date: 2017-10-18 07:41:40

You are saying hashpower dictates the value of bitcoin. I'm saying anyone can buy hashpower but that doesn't mean people will blindly follow.
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:33:36
2mb blocks require a hardfork. Core does have plans for a blocksize increase but they try to incorporate other hardfork upgrades so to keep the number of hardforks at a minimum.

Okay but how long will it take your bank account to give money to someone else in another country that doesn't have a bank account? And how much would that cost? Sorry for the loaded question. But Banks can't compete with Bitcoin.

Right? Why can't they hard fork Bitcoin cash to remove eda, set their desired blocks, and have segwit? It's because they are after the honey badger and not any other alt.

You also incur an opportunity cost not having it in Bitcoin.

Question for the knowledgeable, I can always use this technique for any hard fork?
@_date: 2018-07-25 07:36:59
Don't forget there's fees for a market buy so set a limit buy(no fees) for a little under and the Bitcoin volatility hopefully swings that price range instantly.

Is electrum on tails using tor okay or should the device still be offline?

You don't need a hard wallet. Electrum on tails os not connected to the internet or a paper wallet/ seed etched in stainless steel is just as secure but not as convenient
@_date: 2018-07-25 00:50:04
Yeah. It's just so tempting to margin trade because I understand bitcoin's value proposition. The volatility of bitcoin's price makes it such a gamble though.
@_date: 2018-07-25 22:55:57
Well Bitcoin is just a number. But at least you own the rights to send it.

Ah right a real hardfork with majority consensus does not require replay protection. One will just die.
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:54:02
Nope. They can direct their "90%" hashpower to mine something no one wants. I can wait 5 years for difficulty to drop since I believe in the project.
@_date: 2017-10-23 09:55:14
Just a guess: Bitcoin moves on, Segwit 2x dies, whoever finances 2x loses money, we post memes on r/btc, another fork comes up because the biggest attack vector to Bitcoin isn't its code but people, rinse and repeat until bad actors lose money trying to hack it, ???, Profit.
