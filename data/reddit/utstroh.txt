Probably just credit card and small relatively unsecured loans.  Subprime was secured loans and the security no longer covered the value.  The problem for the people that took the loans will be if they sell.  BTC will pass it's all time high.  The question is when.

Agreed but unfortunately some people are lucky enough to avoid that and then think the rest of us just flipped the coin wrong.  Then there's those that are so insulated by the wealth of their ancestors that even when they do fail they don't realize it, or if they do, it's so easy to recover from they can't understand why everyone can't.
I consider myself very lucky.  I'm far from wealthy.  I'm far from prepared for retirement even though it's coming on fast, in fact I'm currently on the 'work til your dead' retirement program.  I still know I'm way luckier than the majority of the planet and not because I made better decisions than most of them.  I was just born in the right place at the right time, made some good decisions, made some bad ones.... it irks me when powerful people can't see that.

If you divide what actually has been invested by the number of people in.  Then take into account some are in too deep and some are just filthy rich it all makes sense.
@_date: 2018-01-12 05:54:16
Chance?  Sure but it's very small.  The problem is anyone that believes in it is buying all they can when it gets into the 4 digits.  During the last major dip it went down to 5600 and then billionaires started buying and sending it up fast.  Some major bad news would be needed to get it down that low.  Like a quantum computer is out that can break it, with proof.  Or a major catastrophe like a solar flare wiping out all grids on half the globe.  If that happens we've got bigger problems...
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:11:54
Right and that was my point of saying that.  That's the last reason why cryptos won't replace fiat... unless the governments that collect taxes crumble, and then we might have bigger problems than the price of crypto.

If I wanted to move some crypto off coinbase and it wouldn't let me move BTC I'd go move some ltc or ETH if it would work.  That would mean selling some BTC and buying the other.  I imagine that might have a small impact on price.

This guy, that got lucky, has no idea what it's like to fail.  Lucky for him.  Basically saying,

Wow.  What wisdom from a kid with no responsibilities and nothing to lose.
I'm happy for him and his success but disappointed that it's misinformed his view of the world.  He has no idea what it's like to fail.  No idea what it's like not to have money to invest because you need it for necessities.  No idea about really anything except that success came easy to me so it should come easy to everyone.
I hope he always does well for himself but I hope he experiences enough failure that he gets an idea what real life is like.

Yes the US dollar has value b/c everyone agrees it has value.  It has nothing to do with being backed by work.
I don't mean that the dollar only has value b/c the US govt forces us to pay taxes in it.  I do mean as long as they force us to pay taxes in it it will have value!  If all the the other reasons disappear that one will remain.  As long as they can enforce taxes be paid in dollars it will have value.
That value, even though you don't pay taxes, will remain for you because there are people that have to pay taxes with it that you can exchange it with.
If the only reason anyone had to use the dollar was to pay taxes, and that stopped, and no one agreed it had value then it wouldn't have value.  That's my logic that you've misunderstood due to my poor explaining.  
Now if the only reason to use the dollar was to pay taxes the value would be based on supply and demand.  If there wasn't enough to satisfy the supply needed to pay the taxes then the value would go up and the converse would also be true.

It's not why the dollar has value, but as long as their is an entity that can force people to pay their taxes in the currency they demand the dollar will always have value.  How much is debatable.

See what you're trying to do is buy btc immediately even though you don't have the funds in your account.  They'll do that for you but it'll cost you.  Now if the price goes up b/t now and when they get your money you've made out.  If it goes down they've made out.  
When BTC was 7k I started a transfer from my bank.  By the time it got there BTC was well over 10k.  That was frustrating.  I chose not to go over to coinbase instead of gdax and buy with the promise of payment.  That ended up costing me.

I've completely lost track of what this analogy was abased on but I like where it's gone... 
The police rarely stop murders.  The reason people that want to commit them don't is because they are decent people that don't act on every urge and itch they experience OR the fear of the consequences makes them stop and think.  Sure law/ regulation may prevent some murders but the odds of police stopping a premeditated murder is slim to zero unless they're in the supply chain.

best explanation so far
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:10:44
If english isn't your first language I wish I spoke yours that well.
I knew about BTC in 2012.  I was very busy and didn't take the time to learn about it until a few months ago.  
I've now learned as much as I can about it, so far, and I'm sold.  I think it's a great idea. It has weaknesses but the upside outweighs the downside in my opinion.
You need to learn about BTC and decide this for yourself. If you come to the same conclusions as me you'll be of the opinion that one day it will be worth 20k, 200k, 2mil per. I don't know when, and I do believe there will be many more obstacles before that and there's the chance that it will be destroyed because of its potential... but I'm willing to support it and take a chance on that.
I'm putting in what I can which isn't much.
If I had significant debt I'd probably take care of that first.  
Do your research, as fast as you can, and come to your own conclusions.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:12:11
The worst part in my opinion is the cast of characters involved that are running the show.  You wouldn't describe ripple as centralized?  In what ways is it decentralized?  Is this even up for debate?
The premine in my opinion is one  of the biggest problems.  
Just because something is centralized doesn't mean t it can't make a billion dollars...
I'm wrong more times every day than I can count and my opinions on, and objections to, ripple are ideological in nature not economical.  I believe it can go up in value.  I wish you the best in your investments.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:42:18

Yes there will be a dip. It will be the result of FUD and more FUD compounded by the original FUD. Nothing negative will even have to happen in the futures market.  FUD will run the dip.  The question is how low will it go before a novogratz size whale jumps in and ends the sale?  I'm betting it's between 1 and 100 dollars above my buy orders.  Just like last time!
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:43:46
Not necessarily.  If no one's willing to sell at a price equivalent to the global GDP and no one's willing to buy at .00000001 then the price would be the mid-market price. Half way in between the two with no transactions occurring.
If no one's buying and someone's trying to sell and they're desperate they offer their BTC for 10K no one's buying?  Not even the people that are hodling?
What if he gets to 5K?  No whales are jumping in and buying up everything they can get?
What about at 100$?  You mean to tell me no body is buying at 100$   Did everyone die in some apocalyptic event?  Did something happen to the internet?  Did someone finally figure out how to hack BTC?  How is this possible?  There has to be a reason behind it.

This is the best advice.  Take some time to learn about BTC.  Everything you can about it.  If that doesn't ease your concerns then sell and don't look back.  I think you'll be long once you do an appropriate amount of research relative to the size of your investment.
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:43:19
These are very basic questions.  you need to start with the satoshi white paper.
No one controls bitcoin.  There are devs working on the software  there are miners facilitating transactions and "mining" new BTC and there are people running nodes out of the goodness of their hearts and to support their investments.  There might be another reason but I don't know it.  These people are work independently to help make BTC function.  They get rewarded in different ways for doing so.  
No one knows who satoshi is or if he's even one person or a group.  No one has heard from Satoshi in years so he is presumed dead or in jail.  I've heard other theories that Satoshi is AI and that's a fun rabbithole to explore. Satoshi has no control over the price.  If he suddenly resurfaced and flooded the market with the BTC that it is believed he owns he could affect the price temporarily but that's about it.  
As u/EncryptedKiwi said, the value of a bitcoin is only what someone is willing to pay for one AND what someone is willing to sell one for.  The exchanges do a good job of giving us an idea of what that range of prices are.
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:41:08
No time like the present.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:20:03
You saw that?  I blinked and missed it.
I really wanted it to go lower.  I don't have much but was in process of selling all my eth and ltc to get $ to buy at the sale.  Alas it wasn't meant to be.  14k is a nice dip but when it only lasts 3 seconds and it was there not that long ago it doesn't seem like a sale.  If I could get another China ban 2900 to last a few minutes I'd max out my cards, call for increases, max them out again and then start selling shit!
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:31:40
At that price I won't be able to get enough money into the exchange fast enough... and then there was novogratz buying 20 million at 5600.... and then there's miller whos hedgefund is 50% bitcoin at an average cost of 350.  Is this guy shorting BTC?  How much money does he ave against it?  What percentage of his own wealth does he have in it?  I'll tend to believe the people that put their money where their mouth is.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:55:12

@_date: 2017-12-10 04:00:43

@_date: 2017-12-20 04:30:07
Yeah but if that was true they'd dump BTC all at once.  Not every 2 weeks in dribs and drabs. Or am i wrong about this? 
 
Maybe they don't want to sell below a certain price?  They drive the price down and they're like 
"ooooo but if I wait a week I might get 20Gs each for these.  14's a little low this is worth WAY MORE!"

@_date: 2017-12-12 01:13:03
Who's to say?  Think about these supply demand factors...
Over 70% of the bitcoin has already been mined.
A decent portion of that has been lost forever.
Everyday only 800 new bitcoin come into existence and that will be cut in half in a few years.
The final &lt; 30% of the bitcoin supply will be mined over the next 120 years!
How many more bitcoin are yet to be lost forever?
Less than 1/10 of 1% of the world population is in.  The big players aren't in yet except for a tiny minority.  
If the demand doubles what happens to the price?  Depends on how bad those people want it and how reluctant the holders are to selling.
What can demand realistically do over the next 20 years?
If BTC is still going strong in 20 years I think it will be exponentially more than it is.
What can kill or severely harm it?  
Another MUCH better crypto, BTC has first mover advantage.
A cataclysmic event affecting the entire world.
A site like amazon telling customers it not only accepts bitcoin but is offering a 25% discount to those that use it to make their purchase?

Yeah neither me either.  Last time it went to almost 5500 before novogratz jumped in. I imagine it will be higher than that. That was about the 60 DMA at that point.  That's currently at 8775ish.  I imagine there's more than one whale eyeing up the leftovers this time.  Maybe it will go earlier and faster.
I don't know why I picked the DMA as my whale indicator.  It's just something I watch.  100DMA is about 7350.  I imagine it will turn around before that.  If it doesn't I'll be pissed I spent all my money but a 1000$ difference is almost meaningless for someone with my means.  
There's no reason to try and catch the bottom.  I'll either miss in one direction or the other.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:21:39
There's nothing wrong with acknowledging there are problems.  Just remember that with BTC you're getting a group that isn't going to create new problems or wipe out what we already have for the sake of creating new problems down the road.

I'll be holding but they only thing that matters is how scared people will be.  I a good chunk get scared enough to sell the price will drop.  If the price drops fast enough more people will get out due to FUD.  What the CME really does won't even matter.   I'm hoping this occurs.  I want another chance to buy sub 10k.

Wrong.  BTC is totally trackable.  Don't count on being able to dodge taxes with it if you don't know what you're doing.  Even if you do where are you going to spend it?  Mcdonalds?  If you buy anything significant or you want to show income so you can get a loan for a big purchase you have to pay the taxes.
I have a problem with paying some taxes too because 50+% of them, in my country at least, go towards destroying civilizations and killing innocent people.  I'm cool with most of the other 50% b/c I believe they make where I live better in some ways sometimes.  Unfortunately they don't let me pick and choose which ones I can pay and if I don't pay them all i'll be looking down the barrel of a gun, but I want to live in society...

@_date: 2017-12-26 17:26:46


I apologize for paraphrasing.  you did say people are buying it and trying to make money and that's speculating.  That logic leads to what I put in quotes.


Do you have anything to support this?  I don't believe this is true.  I think most speculators have moved through bitcoin into cheap coins hoping to find the next bitcoin.  I've met 2 over the last 2 days that have no BTC except residuals left over from buying alts.


Says who?  Can you support this with something other than your opinion?  Do you believe in the tech?  I'll admit I wasn't buying at 19.7 but not because I don't believe in the tech.  I don't believe in that the average joe's psychology was going to let them buy at 20 until they got used to 15.  


I would agree with this sentiment if you're talking about alts or people throwing money into bitcoin without research.  I don't think that's the case.  Also BTC has been around for almost a decade now.  Parabolic can also result from low supply and high demand.  As to gambling, it is gambling if you're making uninformed decisions which I have no proof that's what the majority are doing.  If you're counting cards and sticking to a strategy you aren't gambling anymore even if you are in a casino.


I wasn't conditioned to hold by anything anyone said on reddit.  I'd be dead if I listened to everything I learned on reddit.  I was conditioned to hold b/c 
1 I want to hold bitcoin
2 Almost every time I sold to try and get back in at a lower price it backfired on me.  When I figured out what the gains would be I realized it's not worth it.  Especially since I believe it will be worth WAY more than it is in the future.


Well we can disagree about that.  The number one use of it, in my uninformed opinion is allowing speculators to move to alts.  That being said you can use bitcoin.  You may have to do some research to figure out where but at this point I'd rather hold.


No. When investing in stocks or directly into a company... then what you said.  There are many types of investing.


No, here I buy in because I believe in the tech.  I believe that since &gt;70% of the BTC is already existing.  A chunk has been permanently lost, only 800 new bitcoins are being made everyday, and the remaining &lt;30% will be mined over the next 120 years... I'm fairly confident that regardless of volatility, massive crashes, and parabolic spikes, that the general direction is up.  I believe that bitcoin will be standing when I am no longer based on the information I have.  
Am I all in?  No.  I know that it could go down and stay down for awhile and I might need some of that value.  I know that there are reasons it could completely disappear but I'm willing to bet against that because I like the tech so much.

Say goodbye b/c you're invested in the scum you're rallying on about.  They don't deserve one cent of your confidence and that's what you're giving them.  If you believe in the concepts that bitcoin and monero are based on you need to do the opposite of supporting coins like ripple.  Otherwise there's a conflict within you.
This isn't a jusgement, do what you want. Ripple may go up but you sound like someone idealistic that cares about more than making money.
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:59:36
Not me.  I don't have enough to shit when it drops and I'm very long on it.  I can afford to lose everything I have in BTC.  I woke up to it only a few months ago and finally started doing my research.
I shit when it goes up b/c of the FOMO, and I tell myself don't buy b/c of FOMO.  Then it never stabilizes or corrects and the crashes are equivalent to the 36 hour low.  Only 800 being made a day.  Everybody wants some.  No one wants to sell except to take a little profit, "just in case." FOMO and shitting seem like reasonable reactions when I put it that way.
I'm always hoping for a drop.  The day I'm not hoping for a drop I'm either 70 or I've bought in more than I can afford to lose.  When I finally motivated to do my research I came to the conclusion that this isn't magic internet money.  It's not perfect.  It has weaknesses... but holy shit this thing has crazy potential and has held up pretty good so far.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:17:47
Great point but how much BTC could these fuckers possibly have that they're willing to dump?  Why don't they dump it one shot and try to kill BTC if that's what they're trying to do?

The FUD has everyone running scared.  The price is falling fast.  The FUD is compounding and spreading to the holders. The CME folks will jump in and since the price is dropping fast start with shorts.  That will really drop the price.  Then when it gets below 6 or 7k some whale will drop 20 mil on actual bitcoin and the price will shoot up 2-3k before anyone can act on it.  Then confidence will be restored and all the "believers" will jump back in at a slight loss,  The first out will be the last back in.  The bottom will be about 100$ above my limit order and I'll miss the whole thing.

@_date: 2017-12-10 07:56:29
What dip!?  This is the all time high from 3 days ago!  This dip might not be over.  Panic sellers reacting to the retracement could cause a bigger retracement.  Some of the stronger hands could get weak if it gets low enough.  The Fud spreads and then we get a real dip without the CME futures exchange doing anything!
Personally I think a falling price gives those thinking of shorting confidence.  Then the price hits a sweet spot and a whale or whales jump in with obscene millions of dollars and it bounces back so fast most of us not only miss the bottom but the middle!
And the lower the better in my opinion.  I want to get more at 2016 prices!
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:59:18
If you believe that it's going to go way up then anytime is OK.  If you're trying to catch the bottom accept that you might miss and make a guess.  I always try to guess about10-20% over what I think the bottom will be if I really want some.  If I'm just hoping for a long shot I'll aim for where I think the bottom is or lower.

Odds are the second one is true.  Odds are if you lived in a place where little taxes were paid you would never have had the opportunity to get in BTC... but there are philosophical and moral reasons for almost everyone to object to, at the very least, a big part of your tax bill.
The third reason to pay your taxes would be you want to operate in the economy.  Buy houses and cars borrow money... etc.  If you can find a place that won't require you to do that good luck to you.

Another user used an interesting formula that I don't necessarily subscribe to but I am using it just to see what prices will be based on this hypothesis.
The block reward is 12.5 bitcoins and worth about 100,000 at BTC=8000.  (To really get into this you might want to figure out what the average cash equivalent was for every block reward over the four years...)
In 2020 it will be 6.25 so if the electricity costs don't change, and the reward still stands at 100K about &lt;2 years in, sometime in about 2022 6.25 BTC could be worth 100K.
100k/6.25=16k in 2022ish
100k/3.125= 32.5 in 2026ish
Now I don't necessarily buy into this formula but it seems like an interesting guide relative to block rewards.  I can think of plenty of reasons why the price will diverge from this in both directions but more reasons why that divergence would be up.
@_date: 2017-11-01 07:47:06
Yes, and to be a form of currency this needs to be solved, I have no doubt it will be... Especially since someday tx fees become the only way miners make profit/ break even.  If you expect this to be a currency that has to change.  Until then it isn't better than cash.  Lucky for most of us we won't be alive when the last coin is mined...

You don't know enough about bitcoin.  You need to know if you believe in the technology or not.  Otherwise you're just betting on red and black.  This is gambling not investing.  If you don't learn more and decide whether you believe in it or not you will panic sell and FOMO buy based on the actions of others.

Everyone below covered everything except that bitcoin come into existence via "miners." A bitcoin comes into existence when a miner gets a block reward for solving the hash.  He then sells it to cover his costs or reap his profits.  He may sell it to another individual or an exchange.  He gets the money from that entity.  Now you come along and buy that BTC from the exchange or individual.  You give your money to the owner of the coin.  When you sell it you get the money.

Some great points but isn't this fork much different than the last?  Isn't a significant dip more likely this time?  Isn't a slower recovery more likely, especially if 2x wins?? 
I'm relatively new. I don't have much BTC but I value what I do have.  I'm bullish for the long term in BTC and I'm rooting for the original chain b/c I believe in the vast majority rule.  If I jump out, even partially, before the fork, and get back in after, even at a higher price I won't be sad.  My main concern is avoiding a siginficant loss of value I do have.  Not gaining value I don't have.

A correction right now would be in the 6000s.  Don't expect it to get there and if it does don't expect it to last long.  Some whales are looking for a sale like that.  Last correction was below 6000 for less than 5 minutes before a billionaire bought 15-20 mil and it shot back up.  Also I'd expect the correction to come around a threat, bad news, some tech difficulties, the last one revolved around the called off fork and the bcash "attack."  You'll need something serious to shake the faith of some big believers to get a big dip.  Too many people that are in right now believe in the technology not just the chart.

2. in 5 minutes; tomorrow; next week; never?  Who knows.
3.No one's sure.  people may be trying to beat everyone out and that might mean a dip could come well in advance of the fork.  Or maybe not at all.
4. You don't.  You go with the info you have and your gut and hope you get it right.
Check your GDAX emails.  Trading and withdrawals will be limited around the fork.
5. I don't know.
6. "miners" provide the computing power that allow the decentralized system to keep a ledger and perform transactions.  Every 10 minutes, approximately, a "block" is completed.  A miner solves a hash.  The miner that solves the hash gets a reward.  I believe it is currently 12.5 BTC.  There's a lot of competition for that.
I hope that wasn't too complicated.  I'm relatively new and just getting a grasp on this myself so forgive any errors I made and don't make any decisions based on what I've said.  Hopefully you'll get an answer from someone more knowledgeable from me.
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:13:48
I understand your logic, but aren't you concerned that coinbase/ GDAX may not allow trading for 48 or more hours?  A lot can happen to the value of each in that time.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:47:02
So you think if we don't push above that by when... people will panic sell?  I think the majority in cryptos are believers and holders right now.  Sure some are trying to catch the highs and lows but...
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:25:09
That depends on how long you plan to hold it and what you expect it to do in that time frame. 
I can only invest very small amounts so I feel like I need to watch for dips.  I expect at some point in the future it will be less than it is now but I'm not betting on it b/c if it isn't and didn't buy it my little $ will have even less legs.  If I buy now and it dips 25% that isn't really anything significant in terms of my purchase.
What I've been doing is accumulating what I can invest and setting buys around buy walls and dips b/t 2 and 10 percent the previous days high.  I'm averaging less than the most recent price but I have nothing else to invest in the event of a dip.  I wish I'd saved some for a big dip.  If it never comes I'll be glad my orders went through.

No one knows.  Don't let FOMO or FUD be the reason you make trading decisions.  You're more likely to be wrong. 
Are you going to be buying 20 BTC or .2?  If it goes up to 10K from here.  (9100 at coinbase) that's 10%.  Are you putting 1000 in?  You're missing out on 100$.  200? 20$  think about what you're missing out on.  What's the highest (and lowest) you think it could go before your transaction goes through?  How much $ will you really miss if you buy in then vs now?
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:23:09
More importantly than "the fumbling by biz suits" is who's stuffing those suits.  These are people notoriously connected in politics, wall st, and groups that have a lot to lose from the rise of a decentralized currency. 
These forks are hostile takeovers in the sense that they weaken BTCs ability to remain decentralized. That's the most important aspect of BTC and what it can do for the planet and everyone on it, aside from maybe all the things that the block chain itself is capable of with or without bitcoin.

That depends.  Do you already own some?  Do you already own enough to be content?
If no then maybe you should get a small amount.  Enough to feel like you're in but not so much that you'll freak out if it drops 50% for a year.  
Then if it does drop buy more.  If it doesn't wish you had and buy more.
This isn't investment advice.  I'm not good at this.  These are the ways I'd think of the problem.
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:38:48
No.  The reason this would occur would be due to deflation but wouldn't cause deflation or inflation.  BTC is deflationary.  This means it is going up in value relative to the value of almost every other asset.  At least all the ones I can think of.  
Now if you're in the US you've heard about the discussion to eliminate the penny b/c it costs more to make one than they are worth?   I'm sure this has occurred many times in the history of the world and wherever you are you might have a good example of this.  This is happening b/c the buying power of the dollar is going down slowly, the result of inflation, and over 100+ years the penny is becoming more and more pointless.  Eliminating it doesn't cause inflation.  Eliminating it is the result of inflation.
The inverse of this explains your satoshi scenario.  Deflation is occurring.  A satoshi is becoming more and more valuable b/c unlike the dollar there is a limited supply of satoshis, some are being lost, and more and more people are trying to acquire and use them.  This drives up the relative value of the satoshi.  So there theoretically will come a point where there are things people will want to buy and sell that are worth less than a satoshi.  We're no where near that yet.  At this point you can break a satoshi into 10 parts by adding another decimal place.  
Once upon a time a gram of silver was small enough to satisfy most transactions.  Due to inflation, due to the value of silver increasing in value relative to other assets, they eventually had to cut the silver into smaller pieces. This dividing didn't make the silver worth less relative to any other assets (that weren't deflating for there own reasons but that's another tangent that will just make this more confusing than it already is) it just made it capable of buying things that were worth less than a gram of silver. 
I hope these analogies help with your understanding.  Let me know if I can clarify anything.

If I slide to "priority" in send, I then have a range from 541 sat/byte to 979 sat/byte

Bitcoin isn't, at least currently, a replacement for cash money.  Considering its volatility and meteoric rise it currently isn't behaving in a way that a useful currency would.

If you can handle that stress then you should do it.  I don't have any of my assets from my 20s, but I'm not on track for retirement either.
but i digress.  As u/ploxxx9 says wait for a dip and accept the fact at some or many points it may be lower in value than where you start.  Longterm though we all hope that's not the case.

No, better in terms of features that make it accepted world wide even more so than BTC. 
More privacy, lower fees, faster transactions, there are a number of legitimate gripes with BTC but I like the way they tackle the problems without compromising decentralization.   
It would have to be a combination of factors, probably some many or all of us have never even considered, in my opinion to displace BTC.  It may never happen.  It may not happen in our lifetimes.
I wouldn't suggest you sit on the sidelines and try to pick that next crypto.  It may or may not exist yet or ever.  I don't think it does.

That's the conclusion!  The dollar was the first digital currency.  Renaming it the crypto dollar isn't going to kill BTC.  What features are they going to add to the dollar?  Use the block chain for transfers would be nice, get my money into an exchange faster than 6 weeks then...  but other than that what are they going to do to make it a "crypto?"  It's the features that BTC and Monero have that the dollar never will that make them awesome.
This article seems to lack an understanding of BTC. That being said I expect more big crashes but over long run pluto.

I wouldn't expect a collapse without a very significant worldwide disaster.  I would expect dips that will be considered sales by those that love it.
What might be possible is a much better coin coming along and replacing it but this wouldn't be an overnight thing. The first mover advantage is HUGE.  If this did happen BTC would fall to number 2.  It wouldn't disappear.
Now if a major hack or theft happened there might be an extended down period.  I don't think that would knock it out of the top spot.

@_date: 2017-11-27 23:23:08
Depends on your reason for doing it.  If your reason is to steal the contents of the wallet then generally yes it is "wrong."  
Is the owner of the wallet a super villian trafficking humans or something that is clearly evil (not relatively evil or something unproven but declared by some authority)?  Will stealing the contents of the wallet stop a tragedy, murder, rape or kidnapping... or many of them?  Then yes this is a rare instance where the stealing could be justified but still in a black and white world stealing is wrong.  You probably wouldn't want to steal anything from a super villian.
If the reason is to find a flaw in the software, notify the wallet maker, help them solve the problem, and get a monetary reward or a job and not steal the contents of the wallet then no, it's perfectly alright.  You're a white hat and one of the good guys using your super powers for good.
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:07:11
I'm holding.  I care about fees in the future.  I can live with them for now b/c I'm not transacting in BTC.  Even if I never transact in it I know that growth requires the poorest people in the world to get on board.  They're the majority of the world population.  Not only that, part of the point of crypto, in my opinion at least, is to help the people that need it most.
So while I don't think BCH found the solution and I don't like fees or longer tx times, I believe BTC is looking for solutions that won't jeopardize decentralization.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:54:39


Bitcoin is growing in adoption across the world.
In April 2017, Bitcoin officially became a method of payment in Japan. Now, over 260,000 food establishments and retail locations stores are accepting cryptocurrency.
I don't want to be the wet blanket but this is probably one of any cryptos weaknesses right now.  If the number of tx increases faster than the network can handle it that could hurt.

I assume you mean the hard fork occurs and the new coin tries to solve the problem, debatable whether any could as a new coin.
That wouldn't be BTC that would be the new coin. What else is lost with this hard fork?  This is an exercise in imagination. 
The only way a challenging, almost fatal, tx load and a hard fork increase the price of BTC is if the problem is solved.  
Then again this may not be the problem I think it is.  I'm wrong everyday.

I'm not the person you want an answer from but if you want to remain passive you'll have 1 of the old coin and 1 of the new coin after the fork.  Most people believe one chain will die. You'll still have the coin that lives.
My point is it's perfectly possible to stay passive through this and be ok.
If you haven't been paying attention though you might want to split your bit coin cash from the fork before last.  It's around 600 per coin right now.  You can leave that in BCH or sell it and cash out or buy other cryptos.  
All the best to you.

The only part of the chart that matters is the dead center.  If the red side is higher where they meet the price should creep down.  If the green side is higher the price should creep up.  As u/rottenapples4u said that doesn't include the people that are just placing instant orders.  You don't know  who's sitting at their computer waiting to dump 500 BTC or buy up 100.  That changes everything.  Don't day trade based on just this graphic.  You might win here and there but you will be surprised sometimes too.  I've seen 400BTC "walls" just disappear as the price got close.  This messes with the price.  It could just be someone(s) changing their mind. It could be an attempt at manipulation.

1000$ is almost 15% of 6700. When it gets to 7600 you'll still have 14.9% of 7600.
7600 x 0.1493= $1134
A move from 6700 to 7600 is an increase of 113.4......%
You can figure that by dividing 7600/6700=1.134.....
Now you can multiply your starting amount by that 1.134....

This is a great reply!  I agree with you that the fees are too high.  I don't believe that BCH has solved the problem by increasing the block size.
I do believe that the core chain will solve this problem.  Until then I'll rely on cash and checks.  I know not everyone has this luxury.

Yes but just to clarify a ponzi assumes that at the end someone is left holding something worthless. Assuming BTC value stabilizes and gets its fees down...  I imagine one or both of these will be far in the future...  You still have a form of currency.  Something with value.  At the end of a ponzi you don't.

These are my uninformed opinions but I'm thinking about the same things.  Do the opposite of what I do and you'll probably make a lot of money.


Depends.  Everyone's looking at the last few forks.  Anyone that got out is going to be trying to beat everyone else.  So when does the exodus start is a very good question.  If it starts too early do others try to take advantage of what they believe to be a sale/ dip?  Is something like this already going on?
As to the rest of your questions, I wish I knew.  It's possible that BTC dips but what you can sell B2x and BTC for combine to be worth more than the prefork price.  It's possible that these two chains both drop and beat the hell out of each other and the recovery in value takes days, weeks, months...
It's possible 2x wins and a great number of the core disciples just go elsewhere. 
I wish there were clearer answers here but one thing you can be sure of is there is uncertainty and that leaves possibility for profit.  You just have to guess right.

If you tried to remove 70000$ from your bank in cash they would bust your balls and tell you they need notice.

I think you're right, so if someone predicted, that based on the depth chart, 25 million would move the market up 1000$ if I could do that instantly.  I think it's a good bet, considering majority of BTC investors are very bullish, that after first few million people would notice the move and start trying to pile in.  So it would require less than 25 million from the individual.  Big money can have a multiplying impact.

Just playing devils advocate, but the difference is the person that doesn't believe in the technology can get spooked out of the market and contribute to a crash.
People that believe in the technology, unlike speculators, are the ones buying up the cheap BTC at the bottom of that fire sale. 
The ratio of each in the market will play a role in how big the crash will be and how quick it can recover.

I was looking for just over 5000.  Figuring if it got that low it might break 5 but there'd be a buy wall at 5 why risk waiting to get through it.  I think sub 6000 only lasted for about 5 minutes.  That wasn't enough time for me to make any decisions...
It probably would have gone sub 5000 but that billionaire bought a efw ten of million before it got there and spoiled my &lt;1BTC investment.  Selfish SOB.  Doesn't he have enough.

That doesn't necessarily have to happen, at least in our lifetime but it's likely that it calms down.  There's always the possibility of coins being lost to change the supply as well.  




As long as it's deflationary I wouldn't hold your breath waiting for that. It's more likely that china, and countries like it, will make announcements that make it drop so they can buy at a discount.

If you want to repeatedly trade it leave it on the exchange. Only remove what you're going to hold long term and in that case move it to a mobile or hardware or paper wallet.  Leaving it on web based wallets or exchanges when you're holding long term is asking for trouble.
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:24:08




Yes, however this is why I mentioned the "ratio."  If too many speculators get in it could make the crashes much larger and the recoveries take much longer.  If it exceeds the ability of the believers to absorb these swings.
 






I'm not so sure of this.  I think there are more speculators jumping in now than ever but I think a portion of those speculators do there due diligence and become believers.

You'll get 14.5 BCD


Coinbase isn't trading BCH, forked august 1, either but they'll be "releasing" it to those that are entitled to it on January 1.  Those people are missing out on some high points to sell.  If you want to be able to trade it as soon as that's possible move your BTC to a mobile wallet or a hardware wallet.
The rule of thumb is "if you don't have your private keys you don't "own" the coin."  Unless you're actively trading the coin you have on coinbase, I recomend you use GDAX the sister site of coinbase b/c they have better fees, then there's no reason not to get it off the exchange and into your mobile wallet or something similar.

I don't want to convince you to do anything b/c I'm wrong all the time and I don't want you to be mad at me.  That being said this is my thought process.
2x is supported by some in the financial and political world that, in my opinion, have motivations worth doubting.  I don't know b/c I don't have time to do extensive research but I believe, based on the little I've done,  that the new chains are harming the decentralized nature of BTC.  I believe that this decentralization is one of the most important aspects of any future money/ store of value.  I believe that's what Satoshi was going for based on the little I've read and the timing of BTC's release. If it wasn't I don't care b/c I'm not a satoshi disciple or anything it's just my impression and I happen to agree with him on that if that's the case. 
If you don't understand why decentralization is important, well that's a whole 'nother can o' worms.  Check out Andreas Antonopoulos' videos on youtube where he discusses the problems centralization of money causes.  He's not the best source for this but he's the best source that's also discussing bitcoin.
Good luck with your decision.

Technically if you think about it if you sell something for FIAT you're buying dollars.  Everything is selling and buying.  You sell your time or your work to get paid in a currency.

The privacy.  There's lots I don't like about BTC and Monero.  Things I like about say litecoin, but I'm under the impression privacy costs money in tx fees for now.  Maybe not one day.  
In a nut shell it's the privacy and the fact that you can't opt out of it like you can with some privacy coins.  If there will be a crypto that replaces cash it will have to be private and low or no fee.  Monero is the closest to that.
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:54:50

No one knows.  I expect the uncertainty to lower the price initially.  How fast it comes back may depend on which chain is the winner.  Long term I expect it to have much more dollar value than it does today but getting there will most likely be a crazy roller coaster.
I honestly don't know what I'm talking about.  These are just guesses based on a shortage of information.

Where do you store your BTC?  If it's on coinbase I don't believe coinbase has made a statement about this.  You might be out of luck.  As they say, "if you don't have your private keys you don't own the BTC."  You might need to ask coinbase.

Start with the satoshi white paper.  Read about why it works.  BTC is incredibly volatile and if you believe in it you're less likely to freak out when it drops 40% and more likely to take advantage and buy more.

Hold.  I expect it to take a while to sell those 2000 plus BTC, that's 20 MILLION DOLLARS btw, on GDAX books before getting over 10K.  That being said I've seen those walls mysteriously disappear before.  I'll expect a minor blast off after 10K and maybe come back down but I don't see any reason for a significant dip.  If some bad news occurs maybe.
I won't make any decisions based on these beliefs.  I've lost before.

BTC can drop in value during this fork.  It may stay down it may bounce right back, the split value may result in more value than just BTC alone, no one knows.
My strategy will be to keep some BTC for the fork and get into some alts.  After the fork I may jump right back in to BTC.  
One thing I know for sure, after the fork at some point days weeks months later...
 I will either be:
1 Selling all my 2x for BTC b/c BTC has obviously prevailed and I'll be converting fiat back into BTC.
2 Selling both BTC and 2x and running to a decentralized alt coin or two b/c it looks like 2x is prevailing.
Considering who is involved I believe this 2x fork to be an attempt at a "hostile takeover."  This will be a major threat to the decentralized nature of BTC and I believe that to be one of the qualities that make it most valuable.
Good luck with your decisions.  Remember I'm often wrong so don't consider any of the above to be advice.

A wallet stores addresses and allows you to "own" your BTC in an easily transferable way.
A Ledger is a hardware wallet that allows you to keep your BTC extra safe.
A ledger is a means of tracking all past transactions. The block chain is a form of a ledger.
A new block is a record of ALL the transactions that have occurred since the last hash was solved.  Approximately 10 minutes apart but they do fluctuate.
The machine that solves the puzzle, "the hash," gets the reward of the new bitcoin being created.
The miners attempting to solve the hash are obligated to allow their hardware to facilitate transactions in exchange for fees.
I'm relatively new to this and might be wrong and incomplete about most of it.

I want you to be right, but the majority of "the people" aren't in BTC.  In fact as a ratio, there's probably a higher ratio of the .001% in BTC than the rest of us.

Is this something I need to do myself? 


NO!  Do your own research. Talk to friends and people on forums.  Assume they're all bullish on BTC and that there views are skewed in favor of it.  Then prove it to yourself that they're right.  Try to remain objective.  Don't take other peoples word.  If you do you're just gambling.


Do your best to find those coins.  They might be worth quite a bit... Don't worry about the wallet.  I've had one on a mobile for 4 years and I only used it to check the paltry balance occasionally.  Then it crossed 100$ and I felt obligated to start figuring this shit out.  Join coinbase.  Do your transactions on their sister site GDAX.  Keep your coins on GDAX until you're comfortable with your wallet.


If you want to daytrade yes.  I've messed around with very small amounts.  I've done a bit of research and I don't get the impression I'm going to do better with that than buying and holding.  I'll keep reading and playing with less than I'd bring to Vegas though.


Man I hope so but I wouldn't bet the farm on it.  I'm only in as much as I can lose without ruining my life. Buy hold and keep your eye on the horizon to change horses mid stream if necessary.  I'm very confident in BTC but it's a cruel world and almost anything is possible.


You can do it with whatever exchange you're on or local bitcoin. There's a learning curve but when you have a stake in it you'll be motivated to do the necessary research which will result in more focused questions which will result in answers that will provoke new research and new questions...


No there are ways to back it up.  I don't have one.  I use a mobile wallet.  I hear they're more secure than web wallets and exchanges.   I do hear hardware wallets are the safest.  Once my investment crosses a certain threshold I'm not sure of yet I'll get one.


I know the feeling.  When you first show up here you don't know where to start.  Jump in.  Ask questions.  Expect them to be ignored or have jerks tell you how to use google.  I got here 5 weeks ago and didn't know what the block chain was.  This was where I started but has only been a small fraction of my research.  Remember most people here own BTC because they believe in it.  I do too.  Look for opposing opinions to remain objective.

Yeah that's what finally woke me up.  I've been holding a fraction of a BTC since 2013, luckily I didn't replace my phone, and watching it.  After the CHINA fiasco I decided I had to learn everything I can about it.

As u/AnimalXP said the 300M is ETH which is a different crypto. 
If coins are lost that reduces the supply.  If supply reduces and demand remains the same then the price should go up if all other factors remain constant.  Reading about the law of supply and demand will help you understand this concept. 
The main point to keep in mind as you research that is that there will only be 21 million BTC ever mined. The ones that are lost are removed from that total.  That total supply will have to support the BTC needs of humans forevermore.  There is the possibility that this, or something else, becomes a problem and BTC is abandoned, killed, or replaced as the number 1 by a better idea.  As of right now I'm betting against that on a regular basis.

I've been considering this myself lately but I'm feeling like I'd be buying at the top.  I have nothing to base this on.  Just gut feeling and this isn't advice.
I'm considering litecoin just so I can move to other cryptos quick easy and cheaper. 
It sounds like you want to daytrade.  I mess around with a couple dollars but nothing that means anything to me, when I'm bored and think I might see an opportunity.  So far I'm down 15%.  Not enough to care about but on a larger scale that might be significant.  Considering my own limited experience I'd advise against doing it with any money that means something to your quality of life or future.
I've heard a ton of stories of people daytrading BTC and making money.  Most of them would have more if they just held.  By their own admission.

Find "miner fee."  For the lowest fees select "low-priority." Now go back to your send feature.  Look at the sliding scale.  There should be some lower numbers there.

I never thought about this... but it's true.  Constantly cutting things in half never truly results in nothing.
So correct me if I'm wrong but in 2140 the block reward is
0.000000005820766091 BTC
Is this considered the end of block rewards only because BTC is only currently divided into 100 million parts and were talking about billionths at this point?  Who's to say a billionth of a BTC won't be worth something in 2140?

You didn't have the option to sell b/c the exchange didn't give them back to you but they did hold them.  The exchange shouldn't be rewarded for screwing people and a potential reimbursement to the victims shouldn't be cut so that the govt can grab fines.  
I get your point but the fact is the investments have appreciated significantly and the money value is there.  In the case of the 100$ spent on crack odds are you'll never get your hundred.  Maybe you can get a judgement on someone that will never own anything but when you get to incorporation now the assets get liquidated.  EVERYTHING in this case should go to the victims and assume they were forced to hold until the date of payment.  If I put my entire life savings and all the equity in my house into BTC and then Mt gox hodled it for 5 years and what they held increased in value I should get my prorated share of whatever's there.
Again I get your point but I see in the law where there are inconsistencies and judgement calls and in this case I think a judgement call along these lines is necessary.
@_date: 2018-03-10 20:37:11
Seems to me the fair thing to do would be to divide what's left over evenly to the victims prorated based on their investments.  Of course these things are never about being fair.

Too many people don't realize, or care, that the banks destroyed lives,  families, life savings, homes... hundreds of thousands if not millions of them in the united states alone.  They still put them fully in charge of their financial future...
This brings to mind WWII.  I find most Americans have no idea why they Japanese bombed pearl harbor.  The best answer I've ever gotten was they wanted the islands as their own, and that might have played a part... I'm sure it was a combination of reasons...
The answer I've found to be most plausible and least spoken 
(I was never given any answer in grammar school through collegiate level history courses)
was that when Wall st caused the great depression it was bad in the united states but it was much worse many other places.  Japan suffered terribly, much worse than the united states, and was determined to never have to deal with that again.  It saw the US as the cause of their misery.  
So at least some people get it when they're being screwed by banks, just don't expect to beat them the way japan didn't.  Makes the satoshi name mean little more to me now that I think about it.

I think it's a bad idea.  Most fail at this but I wish you luck.  The only advice I have is monitor your progress against bitcoin.  Not dollars.  If you aren't gaining more bitcoin over time you could have just bought and held bitcoin and done better.
Then you have to take into account that any trade you make where there is a profit, that you held less than a year is susceptible to income tax... at least in the US.
If you held it more than a year you still have to pay tax but then only the capital gains rate.  If you're daytrading you're not holding for more than a year.

1300 in a day is not a big deal so I don't know how you can come to these conclusions.  It's perfectly feasible that investors didn't see the volume, saw it stall at 11.7 and sold all or part to look for a swing trade.  If the holders were selling we'd be below 5k and this would be snowballing rapidly.
While I'm not a hodler, I hold and swing very cautiously, I respect the hodlers.  If it wasn't for them BTC probably would have gone way lower than 6K.  At the same time it frustrates me that it didn't go lower so I could get more for less.

I'm no expert.  I've been seriously paying attention to BTC for about 10 days now and trying to learn all I can so don't take my world for anything I'm far from an expert in any of these matters...
In my opinion that sounds like a reasonable plan.  Especially since we may have seen the bottom already and this is a bounce.  I'm betting 53ish wasn't the bottom and this bounce will lead to another mini exodus before the stabilization and inevitable climb.  
If you get in now, plan to hold, and it goes to 3000 ( I don't think it will but just making crazy arguments with myself)  I think it will come right back before november 18 and start the cycle all over again only even more so than the previous 2x.  
Everyone watching has seen it happen 2x in less than 3 months.  The next time even more people will be ready for it.  More people will be trying to catch the upswing in alts.  More people will be trying to avoid the down in BTC.  I'm getting the impression that the general consensus believes the next fork will be creating the most valuable forked coin yet.  That will magnify the swings even more.
My point with the above is if you lump in now make sure you really believe in bitcoin so you have strong hands.  If it does go to 3k over the next few days will you panic sell on the way down?  I wouldn't and won't.  I'll be sad I misjudged the bottom but I've no doubt it will come back.  The question is when.

If you've locked up the bitcoin for years the investors should receive the prorated amount of what ever's left from the liquidation because it won't replace the total that the investors missed out on by the rise.  They actually held btc just not enough.

If you haven't noticed, even in the major stock-type markets, there are a lot of long term holders.  They're all convinced that the dips and gains will average out over the course of their life to be nice profits.  The fact of the matter is it depends on when you have to finally stop holding.  
If you're already retired and counting on living off the interest a big crash makes you dip into your principal and then after the recovery you have less principal to give you interest.
If you're unfortunate enough to meet some disaster, a loss of a job or worse, and you're forced to pull money out at the wrong time you lose.  This happens to a ton of people everyday.
Wall st and the whales know how to move money from the plebs into their pockets.  That's the point of markets.
Now that being said I'm holding through this dip, and others, because I'm fortunate enough to not be in a horrible enough spot to be forced into selling the tiny amount of crypto I have.  Do I wish I sold it at 19.6 and bought back in at 6k?  Hell yes, but if I had it would have gone to 50k and I would have bought back in before the dip.  I hold because I know I'm horrible at timing the market, not because some whale is trying to steal my money... and I believe they are and I know they usually succeed.

I'd agree with you about the war part and the prison part but have to disagree that ALL taxes are theft.  Some taxes are theft.

So if you've got that big a problem with them there are ways to avoid paying taxes legally.

Deflationary means it's going up in value relative to the cost of living. Aside from the dips and crashes that's what bitcoin is doing. The dollar is inflationary. It's going down in value relative to most goods and services. 
However, atm, the dollar is, relatively stable, and going down in value slowly. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. If you've got to borrow money to buy a house or a car or you use a large amount of credit in an emergency you want to be borrowing that money in the form of a currency going down in value.
Imagine you borrow 100k. Imagine you buy a house with that. Imagine the house is only worth 75k 10 years later.  You have to pay back 100k + a crap load of interest. Except it's more than 100k b/c the dollar is worth more than when you borrowed it.  
I "own" a house. I'd prefer inflation. I want the payment to seem like less as time passes not more. This is why the rich and money savvy don't keep a dollar as an investment. Sure they keep what they need to function liquid but the rest is put in assets. 
Deflation can be just as problematic as inflation. One key feature of the great depression was deflation.  
Sorry for long post but I see a lot of people here writing like deflation is superior to inflation. Both have their good and bad aspects depending on the degree and your place in the economy.

If I could predict dips and run ups I wouldn'tbe hanging out on reddit trying to learn about bitcoin.  I'd be speculating in everything I could speculate in and filthy f'ing rich.
As to your situation, did you convince your parents to invest or have they given you permission to invest?  Will they be watching your every move?  Either way I'd explain to them this is very volatile and it will definitely go down at times for a short term, but you believe in the product, and more importantly so do many more people, so you're thinking long term.  You're thinking of dollar cost averaging x dollars every y number of days.  That should ease any anxiety they'll have when it does dip.  Show them the history.  Show them how big the crashes have been in the past and how rapidly BTC recovered.  Show them the reason for those crashes.
Most people that can predict dips aren't here telling others about them unless they're trying to create them.  The best you might be able to do is time your purchases with the dips.
Good luck

I'd hesitate to group huge depressions in with subsistence farming but otherwise agree with you and upvoted your comment.  
Before the vulture capitalists "invade" a poor country like thailand, india, china, etc... yes there's poverty and hunger by our standards etc but the subsistence farmers survive and feed their neighbors and people are relatively happy and have free time to spend with their families or whateer they'd like to do with it.  Then after industrialization comes the water is polluted, the air is polluted, and people are working an insane number of hours to get barely enough to scrape by.  There's massive unemployment, illness, poverty, hunger, and catastrophe/ super fund level pollution... but now there's a handful of local billionaires and millionaires so I guess it's ok.

Wouldn't this be a good idea if they were doing the selling through the exchanges but buying the btc from the private market, ie miners etc through unknown representatives? That way they get to buy without severely skewing the price but can knock the price down before they buy with a sale.

@_date: 2017-10-31 20:42:01
I'm not sure I can adequately answer that but I get the impression that some exchanges may not honor the new coin or allow you to redeem it.  I believe that was an issue in some cases with the last 2 forks.  
There's also the possibility that they won't allow you to redeem it until days or weeks later.  This may be a problem b/c then you can't sell it.  If the price is tanking and you want to sell you'll be stuck.
@_date: 2017-10-26 21:53:41
I just looked it up. Fees are 7.6% to buy. Not crazy compared to some a half hour south. Over 19!  Cool but I'd expect better costs from localbitcoin. I'd only use it if I needed btc in a pinch, or maybe as a one time novelty.

You need to change the bet to an over/under.  You need to both agree on what that number is.  
If it ends the year at that number it's a push.
If it's over that number he owes you X bitcoin.
If it's under that number you owe him X dollars.
That's the way I'd set up the bet.  You're both so far apart what happens in the middle?  You need a middle number as the over under.  If he's comfortable with 81 he should be comfortable with 8100 or whatever you can agree on.  If he's not allow a bigger spread for a push and point out that he doesn't seem very confident in his prediction.

Impossible to say.  Especially since anything we would use to assign value is fluctuating itself.  I think it's safe to say it will be worth more than it is...
Also, it's possible that the value of BTC never stops going up. Once the last BTC is mined, if demand continues to grow, the price will still go up.  
This is part of what makes it a poor currency.  It's a fantastic store of value but the best currencies are slightly inflationary.

Isn't that the pot calling the kettle grey...
From the article. "There is no evidence that any of the registration rolls were altered in any fashion, according to U.S. officials. "
Anyway that isn't proof, that's a talking head saying, "I can't show you the evidence but take my word for it RUSSSSIAAAA!"  If you selectively trust elected officials and the people the appoint then good luck to you.  I do not.

So I've been watching here...
and in the last few minutes the best fee for a fast and cheap BTC transaction has fluctuated between $1.09 and $1.80. That's awesome.

BTC isn't that anon unless you jump through flaming hoops and know what you're doing.
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:18:54
I think it will dip in the short term, how much I wish I knew, and then go north long term.
I thought it would dip after the bch fork but I expected more than we got... I assume the b2x fork lingering on the horizon stopped that from occuring...
I'm known for frequently being wrong so don't take my word for it.

All these other comments are very reasonable but there are disadvantages to a rapidly deflating money just like there is advantages in a hyperinflation scenario.  
I don't expect BTC to go down over the long term.  I expect the demand per unit to go up and in turn the price to do the same thing... of course it will be a roller coaster ride. There just are way too many people that will still get into bitcoin as the tech becomes easier and easier to use and more and more ways to use it spring up.
If the fees ever go back to the sub 20 cent level per transaction you're making it useful to everyone on the planet that makes less than 2$ a day!  That's a lot of people.

Is all that's necessary, for security purposes, moving (exporting) it to a new wallet or do I need to change the address of (sweep) it too?

Dude you were a boring 19yo!   ;)
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:52:06
So all black and grey is false.  That's kind of the same thing as not seeing shades of grey.  We don't have to quibble about meaningless things if you don't want to.  You're entitled to your opinion and I'd never take that away from anyone... no matter what they base it on.
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:05:06
I tend to agree but
1 my income doesn't come in in lump sums.
2 We all know something about BTC and the forks that kinda makes this crash and the one on Nov 19th a self fulfilling prophecy.  Why lump in now?  
@_date: 2018-02-13 04:38:45
I never listened to it.  I hear it.  Laugh it off and move on.  Anything Dimon has to say is bullshit to make him and his rich buddies richer and fuck the commoners.

Yes sir

Most of us, yes.  Especially on number 3.

I imagine coinbase will give you the new coin but I think they might not allow you to take it right away.  So others will be able to make moves with their new coins affecting the market price and you won't be able to react.
I'm not sure why someone would suggest not moving coin to a wallet before the fork someone else will have to answer that.
If you own BTC during the block at which the fork occurs then the address that held the BTC can also be used to redeem the new coin.  This is my understanding of it.
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:33:26
Agreed, I'm not arguing that just b/c it is infinitely divisible that we'll have an unmanageable number of digits after the decimal.
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:27:00
No.  There are far better ways to help people with crypto than giving it to some regulator.  I'm sure he's doing fine.
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:14:00
Absolutely not.  Agreed.  However if I thought he was doing or supporting something I was ideologically opposed to I'd boycott him.  The world would be a better place if more people did.

I could be wrong, I often am, but I believe above a certain amount, which isn't that high, these machines verify you almost as much as an exchange does.  They also have cameras on them. These things are regulated, so local btc.com is probably more anon and cheaper.
@_date: 2018-02-28 03:10:31


I'd argue it would be a bigger deal.  However 5 years ago it wouldn't have been nearly the deal it is today, and your family is far more important than fort knox.

You're misunderstanding me.  Pi is infinite therefore it's impossible for bitcoin to be longer than Pi. ;)

Right so the odds of a miner "winning" goes up.
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:07:30
If I had a lot of money to play with I'd probably do the same thing but I'd rather miss the very bottom than start buying too early, not to mention DCAing or lumping in on the way down keeps us from actually getting the bottom we'd otherwise have.  I'm looking forward to the sale.  The little BTC I have I'm holding longterm anyway so I'm not thinking of the value of that.

You are, if you go and earn them in a place that hasn't already built up and maintained an infrastructure that you and previous generations have and will benefit from.

Neither do I.  I imagine you're right... but if a few go off in my country it's worthless to me!
That being said I'm betting against that scenario.  :)
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:21:39
Is that so?  Can't the block rate significantly stray from 1 every 10 minutes if it's only changing that frequently?  That's only 1x every 2 weeks!
And thanks for informing me.
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:15:25


I'm newer than you but I'm the first here so I'll tell you what I think I know and that you should verify it from someone else.
If you have 10 BTC before and at the moment of a fork, then you have 10 BTC and 10 of whatever the new coin is after the fork.  You just need to use the address that the BTC is at to claim you're new coin in whatever wallet or exchange will redeem it.  You can move to one of these after the fork and do so.


If after the fork you "split" your BTC and b2x  and then sell 3 of your 5 b2x you then have 5BTC and 2 b2x.  They are completely independent of each other.
It seems to be frequently recommended not to keep your BTC on an exchange during a fork.
