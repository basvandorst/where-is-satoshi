At this point I'm convinced that I lost $110 worth of BTC for a hotel room booking gone wrong with Expedia.  Expedia says the hotel owes me the refund, and the hotel says they cancelled the reservation - never got paid from expedia, so Expedia owes me the refund.  It's a game of pointing fingers and neither of them know what bitcoin is.
This is the transaction which shows I did pay the BTC to Expedia;

Booked a hotel room thru expedia, paid with BTC, checkout was super fast and room was reserved.  Got to hotel, found out that the date was wrong; it was right around midnight when I booked, something got screwed up when booking.  Hotel had no rooms available.  Sat there 2 hours in the lobby on the phone with expedia.  No one was able to help.  Several calls to expedia; several of them called the hotel when I was standing right there in the lobby.  Every time I ended up getting disconnected.  Left the hotel, found another, paid with creditcard, slept, woke the next morning, started process of wrestling with expedia all over again.
I've been on the phone with expedia ANOTHER 2-1/2 hours already today.  4 transfer/disconnected calls so far today.  On perma-hold now with someone who may or may not help.  I hate the idea of having paid $110 for a room that I won't even be able to use tonight; no one can cancel the reservation, no one can offer any credit, no talk of any possible refund.
Expedia; you're RUINING the pay-with-bitcoin experience.  Not a single one of your phone reps have ever heard of bitcoin.  Don't offer to accept it as payment if none of your phone staff has ever been exposed to it or trained in any way about how it works.

Saw that face, immediately my mind was screaming "Stay away.  Don't walk, run."

They serve decent enough food in jail.  Better than food stamps can afford to buy you on the street.  Plus a roof over your head, TV, exercise facilities, etc... don’t get me started... been there, done that (a very long time ago, in a different life), I’d rather not go back.  Instead, I’ll just stack sats and watch the jackassery from afar.
