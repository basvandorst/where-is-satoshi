You pay the same sat/byte fee, but the size of the transaction will be smaller. So the fee will be lower.

Just look a chart and you will see that Bitcoin doesn't always go up. Bitcoin goes up and down like every other assets.

I think he's intentions are good. But since he has no technical background he don't understand why Segwit is a better solution. BU is easier to explain for a 5 year old kid.

I have no idea. But most people are here to read about bitcoin. If I want to read about bcash I go to their sub. People don't post about dogs in a cat sub and so on. It would be a mess if people posted about unrelated things all the time. Then we could just have instead.

It's just posters. But would ofc be better if people sit down and talk instead.

I think this is the least bad option. If we don't find a solution soon, people will leave for the altcoins.
@_date: 2017-05-03 12:50:26
Probably have to do with the Bitfinex situation.
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:54:27
Ok, so you just need Tails to generate a seed and master public key (+ some addresses) in a safe environment. Then I would say this is a safe way of doing so.
@_date: 2017-05-18 05:25:16
Where can you see the percentage?
@_date: 2017-05-05 15:15:58
I always pay with Bitcoin when it's possible. But with this high fees I can't do it anymore. We need to scale asap.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:42:35

Ohh, the altcoins bubble is bursting. Who could have guessed...
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:35:26
Why don't you just store the seed at tails persistence volume? Then you have have an air gaped way of doing transactions. Create a transaction with your watch only wallet, boot up tails and sign it, then boot back to your watch only wallet and broadcast it.
@_date: 2017-05-18 04:47:46

Install mycelium on another device and import your seed. If you're then able to see you bitcoin balance from there, you have confirmed the seed. It's now safe to wipe your phone.

Don't speculate in altcoins. 99% of them will crash and become useless. I understand eth and nem could have some value. But eth will probably fall down with rootstock and all ico's with smart contracts in mind.

@_date: 2017-05-05 16:41:26
How would the attacker get the signed transaction? I suppose OP would protect it and only broadcast it if he needed to recover and had control over his Coinbase account.
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:57:20
Only mistake I've done when it comes to Bitcoin, is that I didn't bought more.
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:17:26
1) I'm not sure, but think anti-SegWit people just prefer BU since it's easier to understand. Also Satoshi mentioned increase in block size as a solution for scaling. So maybe they are a bit conservative?
2) Big blocks = bigger blockchain = fewer can run a full node and more centralization. Also a lot of other more complex consequences. Also huge risks with hardfork.
3) In my opinion it makes no sense to increase the block size from a technical view. But maybe we need a political solution now and not the best technical solution. So I wont oppose to do both anymore.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:40:58
What is "sell"? Can't find it in my vocabulary...
@_date: 2017-05-09 03:40:54
Wallet app on the smartphone and a paper backup of the seed would be the best general advice. Smartphones today are very secure with the apps running isolated in virtual sandboxes.

@_date: 2017-05-29 15:53:01
You never know. I think the price is about to rise again. Just my guess, but everything can happen. Buy now and hodl to at least next halving is my advice.
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:38:59
3.42% of all wallets.
@_date: 2017-05-01 22:31:39
2) You can setup an offline USB drive with Tails. It will contain Electrum as default. The private key can be stored on the encrypted persistent volume. Since you will run Tails air gaped you need an extra USB drive or SD-card to move signed transaction to an online Electrum wallet to broadcast signed transactions. You can import the master public key from Tails to the to the online Electrum wallet for "watch-only"-mode.
You either do this or buy a hardware wallet like Trezor to store your Bitcoins safe.

No. SegWit is not an ICO, so you can't invest in it.

Yes, you can use any generated address för receiving.

Moore's law is only about the number of transistors on a chip. To just assume it is about all hardware is wrong. For example the CPU only increase with 3-5% in prestanda for every new generation now days. But the biggest concern would be the network layer where you would see a drastic increase in error rate and instability. Things change and today hardware manufactures no longer talk about Moore's law, since it no longer apply. If you read Satoshis white paper like a bible you will get stuck in the past and blind for the realty we face today. 
@_date: 2017-06-01 00:36:59
Well, it's true. Just because we are pro SegWit doesn't mean we can't be honest of the current situation. BIP 148 is an irreversible ultimatum from the users (probably a majority). Activate SegWit or fork Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:34:12
Thanks for the explanation. I thought the segregated witness data was not on the blockchain. But that will only be true for old nodes if I understand it better now.

It's Bitcoin Unlimited. Don't know why they changed name.
@_date: 2017-06-20 16:32:31
Blocksize cap will be 2 MB. But if SegWit reduce the size of transaction data with 73%, it will in effect be equivalent with a blocksize increase to ~7.4 MB.
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:09:33
Not sure about that. You need to give away your private key. He could be double scammed.
@_date: 2017-06-15 00:50:54

Why are you even asking that question? Have you seen or heard about that would be the case? Give some context or stop with such FUD.
@_date: 2017-06-09 06:44:52
No, the blockchain should be a settlement layer and then payment channels off chain above that. There's no need to vote about that since there's technical limitations making this the only path forward. For example you can't vote if the earth is round. Just face reality and adjust accordingly.
