Thanks for the reply! Glad to hear you're doing well. That was very well worded response. If you have the time take a look at the video too. I am in the process of starting a car detailing business myself and it is doing well so far. I really enjoy the work and the freedom it has given me! Best of luck on your adventure.

Absolutely, a lot of people are driven to buy unnecessary extravagant things.

Glad you're able to find happiness with that as well!

I suppose so to a degree. I am not very emotionally attached to my coins at this point. Just thankful for what I have. I didn't exactly invest directly into it, but use to receive payments in it and kept it.

I'll take a look into! I haven't heard of it yet myself.

Absolutely, I tried to make it as clear as I could that there is a big difference in stocks. But still a decent way to show funding and growth of a company. Yeah, this market is going to be crazy. Next 20 years will be great.

That was pretty good. Thanks for the laugh.

That is a fair assumption. Could also be something they have a good quantity of though too, or a side company that they are working with. None the less we will have to see what happens.

As well as I have many shorter videos. I had not made any content for youtube in over 4 years and I am just now finding my voice in the space again. So bare with me, but I appreciate the feedback negative or positive.

Fair enough, but for a new user in this space that 10 minutes could save them thousands of dollars. The video is not really geared towards people knowledgeable in the space. (Little bit of a click bait title, but someone who knows their coins are secure probably would not click)

They have had interest in the space for quite a while. They own a lot of crypto urls as well. But we will have to see what happens. 
@_date: 2018-04-21 01:44:51
Did not know they actually removed support for gift cards. I'll have to look into it more. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 03:38:12
Yeah, they have a lot of stuff gearing towards it. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 21:14:28
Same XD

That is a possibility. Regardless of what it is, I believe if it is not dealt with there could be an issue in the crypto economy in the future.
