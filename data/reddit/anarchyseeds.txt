I have to agree, it seems that if more people offered services for micropayments, people would begin to wonder what they could do for micropayments. The idea of a "minimum wage" is a restriction against small ideas becoming big. 
All big ideas started small, so where have left ourselves? It is time to take our lives back. 50 @_date: 2015-01-21 02:51:34
The clerk now sells condoms only in 6,8, and 12 packs.
The 6 packs are called the Italian pack, one for everyday except Sunday, that's the Holy day.
The 8 packs are called the French pack, one for everyday of the week and an extra one for the weekend.
The 12 packs are called the British pack, 
one for January...

Is anybody working on a way to program money as a continuous value? Is there any good way to store values without specifying a maximum number of digits?

Thanks for doing this! 50 seeds @_date: 2015-01-13 23:04:06
I want to create a block chain charity where people can become anonymous recipients and continuously receive bitcoin. I realize that with my initial investment into the program of 5 dollars, even with just 100 costumers, would need more than 8 decimal points after a week if everyday everyone gets half of the pool each day.

More like hubris if they think this post will affect btc price (they don't).

Why doesn't everyone who is using bitcoin and participating in consensus agree to increase the value of what they hold by agreeing to decrease the coin limit to below 21 million??
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:49:29


You are going in circles. The question is why wouldn't intelligent rational decision-makers try to make their coins more valuable by forking?

Sorry to mess with ya, loved the blog post by the way.

You can check out an interview with the CEO on the Tom Woods show and he says they keep 10% in bitcoin, the rest they need in fiat to pay for stuff.

I didn't thank you. Instead of your peasantry sarcasm maybe you should figure out why this doesn't mean anything...

Hi made a [blog]( that accepts bitcoin donations.
This is my [tipjar]( which is connected to this reddit account. Thanks for doing what you're doing.

By hyper-inflating its currency? Fair trade. Bitcoin can take it.

That's some P=NP shit right there.

Thanks boss, it goes a long way with me.

Hieratic systems pale in comparison to decentralized ones. There is competitions in both, but elections and congressional votes do not hold as much information as prices.

Killer app alright, this is where AI-run companies decide that eliminating humans is the best way to maximize utility.

"Government can't solve all of our problems"
True, but it can't solve any of our problems either...
