I have nightmares about greed people.

I think you forgot 'and' about fifty times. You know, one for every state.

My friends don't believe in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-28 18:32:20
So basically, I have an address (B) with 1 BTC in it that was sent to me from another address (A), the only evidence of that address (B) having at least 1 BTC in it is the fact that the 1 BTC was spent by address A?
@_date: 2013-10-30 19:08:26
Sounds good! I think this will be a lot easier than learning code, but at the same time, I can start by saving and then coding or just do it simultaneously.


Why not? Wouldn't want to invest something you can't lose?

I couldn't be more happy with you guys and I too love how you handled that guy!
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:20:13
Haha, thank you. I don't whether to take that as a joke or what. But thanks anyway.
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:38:25
I forgot why I choose not to read this sub. Oh wait...
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:31:34
Indeed. Thank you.

So how would a non-programming, non-tech person go about cracking this code other than guessing 3 character keys at 40 keys per minute?
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:49:50
Also, I see a lot about paper wallets and read about having a bunch and leaving them in cold storage until you need them, if I were to start a savings, (which I currently don't have yet) should a start a new account/address every time I buy some Bitcoin? 
Also, I am keeping an eye on which I think could help me and Bitcoin a lot.
@_date: 2013-10-28 17:36:03
How do you backup a wallet if it is all stored on the network anyway?
@_date: 2013-10-29 02:05:03
It's very weird.
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:47:02
Huh, that's a good way to look at it. Appreciate the input and I will definitely start doing so. Thank you!

@_date: 2013-11-23 20:38:18
Didn't realize that! thank you!
@_date: 2013-10-29 02:00:10
Like what?
@_date: 2013-10-26 19:46:38
Good point...but at the same time, if there is constant flow INTO the account and no withdrawals, I would assume that it was for saving. But if it's a one time deal, and they just dropped off, then how would you go about keeping the currency in circulation? I mean, I understand if it was someone who was PURELY solo mining and it's just been that long since he was able to mine something. Then when you think about it, there's also tons of real physical money that gets stored away by people for savings and end up dying, leaving the money undiscovered for eternity.

I'm always down for a treasure hunt! I guess that all makes sense. Thanks for explaining and the useful links!
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:48:26
Stop trying to make fetch happen!
@_date: 2013-11-18 16:26:18
AHHH! That makes more sense. I was speculating but I wasn't too sure. Thank you for this!
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:31:45
There's a Bitcoin in my boot!
@_date: 2013-10-28 17:46:16


What's that?
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:19:20
Thanks for the link! it looks like I have a long way to go, but I have to start somewhere, I guess!
See, I would have started in a completely wrong direction. Thank you! Python it is.
Very true. Will do!
@_date: 2013-12-22 03:48:07
Late to the party much? ;)
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:56:06
Sweet, forgot totally about that. Thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:18:01
Damn damn.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:39:32
Very nice! Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-17 01:57:38
WOW! Just the box makes the pizza look delicious. Man, Bitcoin must be tasty!
@_date: 2013-10-31 16:19:08
Understandable. 
I've made a ton of marketing videos in the past. If you're interested in my work, shoot me a pm.
@_date: 2013-10-29 02:00:49
On my way! Thanks!
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:16:44
Thank you for this! Is [Treehouse]( any good? I mean it looks pretty good to me, but I don't consider my self a good judge of that sort of thing.
@_date: 2013-10-27 00:05:49
Fair enough! I think I might actually start doing the same. Welcome to the future billionaires, everyone!
@_date: 2013-10-28 19:53:55
Holy crap, man! You just blew my mind. Thank you! I think I'm finally grasping on!

Broke drop-outs don't have $1000 to risk like that though. But I do get your point, which is very valid. You also have to understand that the OP is probably not a millionaire thus affecting his opinion, which is why it's his opinion. That opinion can change when he becomes a millionaire from cashing out at 5000%.
@_date: 2013-10-29 21:19:04
Sweet. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:18:34
That would be making $99.90 which is nice, but it's not like some crazy success story like some of the millionaires here.
@_date: 2013-10-29 02:00:31
Good point. Here goes to starting a new savings!
