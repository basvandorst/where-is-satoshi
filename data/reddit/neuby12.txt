A bunch of shitty overvalued companies with weak management crashed in the dot com bubble
Both valuations soared because of fomo by uneducated masses
Difference with bitcoin is it is actually powered by revolutionary technology and anchored to the best brand which has always won big in the long-term

Is he actually scrapping Galaxy? What a joke if so, wish fortress kept him around so he didn’t get so disgustingly rich off ether

Agreed. BTC is simply the first manifestation of world changing software and will forever reap the rewards of being first as far as a “store of value”

Then you fundamentally don’t understand what blockchain is and how it compares to any other software which has existed previously
p2p networks where any individual can hide their wealth and deal with it as they please with any other individual directly didn’t exist before bitcoin and no piss poor management can screw it up, creating a secure storage of wealth with inherent upside.
If you believe good tech wins, you should back bitcoin because it’s the absolute best brand in this revolutionary technology and not worry about short-term fluctuations caused by people who don’t yet understand the value of decentralization

Every industry has different business models but blockchain’s applications are really unlimited. 
Here’s one example: the food industry.
Blockchain can add supply chain transparency like nothing currently in existence. From farm to grocery, each player would be able to verify each other’s activities on the blockchain. 
It’s also extremely fast at tracing a supply chain. Walmart recently tested a blockchain solution to track down the original source of a box of mangoes. It took 2.2 seconds to find vs. nearly 7 days without blockchain (old method). Think about the safety implications of being able to perpetually manage inventory and identify contaminated products. When you source from a million different places like Walmart, blockchain streamlines your ability to track and respond at unbelievable (literally) speeds. And since time = money, you better believe all the big boys will come calling if they haven’t already.
Now take it a step further: what if we apply blockchain to marketplace software? What starts to happen? Do we eliminate the need for retailers? 
Can I buy directly from a farmer now with all the lost supply chain margin back in our pockets, all while remaining anonymous, with no marketplace software company taking a cut?
I don’t know the answers but this is why I’m so excited about it. The use cases are endless. 
Caveating all of this with “I’ll probably have a better answer as I learn more”

I had no clue at first haha, was absolutely incredible

As a relative noob who has always had interest but finally did their own research, it’s so easy to see BCH as the marketing engine fraud it is. One YouTube video comparison of Andreas vs Robert speaking and which path to back becomes extremely evident... 
A side note: Truly have never had an “a ha” moment like I did this weekend with blockchain and bitcoin - it’s absolutely incredible. Too bad it took massive gains to make me learn more, instead of the reverse, but better now then never. Bitcoin is simply too precious to ruin.

Un. He’s fuming about bitcoin price.

When I realized that blockchain software can decentralize any industry. Just kind of happened in the midst of all my research. Everything today is about security and true security will never be achieved if we rely on others to maintain it. And while this had been said to me before regarding bitcoin, it didn’t truly stick.... and then you add the Satoshi mystery and “how tf did someone create this?” on top of it all and I can’t even think about anything else. 
Literally breathtaking when I think of the software’s ability to almost self-govern and remove human trust from the equation. 
You hear people say how ubiquitous it will be, but a lot of that sounds pie in the sky. Well now, I’m a believer in a BIG way. Want to soak up anything  and everything I can on it. We are still at the EARLY stages.... something we can all be excited about.

What if he’s just trying to grow awareness? Maybe we should all do this?

Why would you spend your bitcoin at a retailer?

Some entrepreneurs might value money that doesn’t require all of those things you mentioned. Over time, they might only work with silent, crowdsourced capital given those advantages.

It’s a merchant bank, not a commercial bank like you think of. They’ll invest those funds in different kinds of vehicles.

And risk is one component of an investment. Right now, rewards are potentially massive in this space. Over time with maturity, the risk/reward profile will become more conservative.

I’m a former investment banker who now runs corporate strategy for a former banking client. Have marketed many businesses to VC’s and have had many clients who have VC’s in their cap table.
Did you even know that common equity is just one of many ways a company can raise capital today?
What’s your background?
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:13:08
Well, in an ICO it’s not equity and therefore doesn’t hold traditional equity rights. VC rights are typically aggressive because of the risk they’re accepting so early and many entrepreneurs have been screwed by them.
This is silent money with no covenants or liquidation preference or other potential negative triggers.
Some entrepreneurs might prefer this and others might prefer a more hands-on approach. That’s kind of the decentralization vs centralization debate, isn’t it? And I’m a decentralization BULL.
In my experience, the non-financial benefits of “sophisticated” money are more often underwhelming than not.

Lol! This story is even better as a U of A guy who has been to that Safeway many times... Starbucks across the street?
