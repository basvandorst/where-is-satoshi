Interesting that Sweden and Finland are not in the list. Those countries were the most cashless of europe the last decade.

Bitcoin was a global cryptocurrency from day 1. No I didn't RTFA.
@_date: 2017-02-01 21:31:28
Why 4 years?
@_date: 2014-03-11 12:46:58
no. they are separate implementations, sharing no code whatsoever, due to the different licenses.
bitcoin uses openSSL, and as such doesn't suffer from the GnuTLS bug.

Sounds like a r/theredpill story. All the best to you.

Downvoted for stating the obvious

It ties all your unspent outputs together, indicating they were in the same wallet.

Maybe you meant physical?

Only when the planets align though.

Think of it like this: how low can EUR or USD go. Look up charts of buying power over time of any fiat currency, then ask yourself if it's too late to get out of fiat.

Old financial writer regurgitating semi-valid criticism without nuance + clickbait headline = profit.

Blasted right through it. No resistance. At all.
@_date: 2019-12-04 17:05:16
Of course not :) Hollow barrels make the most noise.

They will know the difference once bitcoins exchange rate will bounce back, while the promisecoin craters

I keep sending fractions back from my phone to my hardware wallet because that crypto just goes up and up :)

Not your private keys? Not your money. Your private keys? Your money.
@_date: 2018-02-26 16:10:16
That's all symptoms of a deeper issue you're describing. I see no problem being less of a consumer and more of a saver. If that immediately tanks the economy, well, you've got central banks and politicians to thank for that with their money printing and inflation driven boom/bust cycles.
@_date: 2017-09-05 06:39:56
Well, no. It will remind people *why* we have bitcoin as it is. Any token that is a *promise* (debt fiat, tether) requires delegated trust, which carries additional risk.
Promises can, and eventually will be broken.

Just vertically flip the charts, then follow you emotions.

Basically increase the cache in the bitcoin client to as much as your computer can handle. This allows verification at near download speed as the UTXO index does not need to wait for I/O
@_date: 2017-05-29 08:50:09
It is if you see it as shorting fiat :P

Also, transaction batching, which is increasingly used by exchanges will lift the median &amp; average tx fees
