So the SEC 
Won't let me be
Or let the markets be free
So let me see
They try to regulate through Ben Lawsky
But my wallet is empty without BTC

This is awesome.  I love electrum and breadwallet (for offline wallet &amp; hot wallet, respectively), but for the longest time I've been looking for a single wallet that I can use for both.  This is perfect.

Looks like a fairly new channel - they have six videos so far with  low view counts.  Did my part to help out.

JRE is such a memory hog.  Oh...oh... the podcast, not the Java Runtime Environment.

"repeating, of course"
"Well, that's better than we usually do.  What do you think guys, can..."
"All right, chums I'm back.  LET'S DO THIS...."

For those in the area, there is also a local [Bitcoin Meetup Group](
I don't run it, but I'm pretty sure the guy that does is also a redditor.  I also believe he runs the [Sacramento Bitcoin]( website.

Inside the Boost Mobile off Franklin &amp; 26th.  And for those that don't know, the first is on the 2nd floor of the Roseville Galleria near the carousel.

* price continues to stay in the $300-$350 range for the first quarter
* continued adoption by mom &amp; pops, local businesses, small chains
* Paypal continues to explore bitcoin and offers further integration
* 2-3 more big names (along the lines of Microsoft or Time magazine) announce bitcoin integration;  each time causing exuberance in the community and making the front page of * Amazon, Google, Apple will remain ambivalent;  executives will make the  occasional statement at conferences, interviews, or AMAs (and only because they are pressed on the issue ) which are (mis)interpreted to be pro-bitcoin and repeated ad nauseam in pump blogs like coindesk, etc.  
* Businesses that do adopt bitcoin will follow the practice of immediately cashing out, with the exception of a handful which keeps a small percentage of their funds in bitcoin
* Some growth in business-to-business (b2b) transactions rather than consumer-to-business transactions
* Non-election year; no real movement in regulation except for occasional statements in the media from politicians, who mainly do so to play to their particular audience at the moment;  any movements made will likely follow Lawsky's lead
* Winklevoss ETF launches in the second half of the year
* $400-450 mid year
* Ends the year ~$550
* IMO no moon; price will trend upward due to adoption by millennials and foreign countries with unstable currencies, but will be held down by companies and business who adopt bitcoin for transactions, but immediately cash out exerting a downward pressure on the price.

Newbish-question:  Why is the halving time always referred to as something that is "estimated"?   If halving is triggered when a certain number of coins that have been released, and if coins are released every 10 minutes, don't we know exactly when the halving will be?

Interesting.  But OTOH, annual US GDP is 17 Trillion, combined global GDP IS 73 trillion.

If only the other proposals weren't vaporware.

Agreed.  No need to hf. The scalability issue has been solved by driving people to alt coins.  Some which have proven that hard forks are not dangerous in the hands of competent devs.
