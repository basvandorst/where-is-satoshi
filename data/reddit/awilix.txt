The sentiment on this subreddit is, "To the moon", "bitcoin will make us all rich", "It's a new paradigm". The truth is Bitcoin is highly experimental and we should all expect to lose everything!

Not a ham operator but I've looked into it a bit. Problem is it has to little bandwidth for full nodes. It could possibly be used in a SPV manner for linking a specific payment terminal to a radio connected to a full node. But considering the block limit today is 1MB and that will have to be increased I don't think it can be used for the kind of emergency network I'm thinking of. 
Look up the TNC-PI for how packet radio can be realised.

The likely scenario in this particular case is that the number of visitors went up during the period they accepted bitcoin in response to all the extra promotion it gave. However casual surfers don't buy subscriptions (especially not if the deal is rotten to begin with) and so the ratio of subscribers vs visitors decreased. There's simply no data. The author of that article must be an idiot if he doesn't understand that. Or he's an idiot if he thinks no one will notice.

That's not reusing. Reusing is when you send btc from an address and point the change address back to the sending address.

Wow. One of the largest exchanges in the world, for a highly experimental technology in a state somewhere between alpha and beta, has practically no auditing checks and live monitoring at all. I can't believe it.
It is understandable bugs do occur especially considering how experimental all this is, but when you are dealing with big money like this the first thing to do is implement auditing. The system should have noticed discrepancies like this. There is and and always will be failures. Software should be designed to allow for failure but it should also detect it at some level.

Absolutely not but they eliminate the possibility of a very large amount of bugs. In dynamic languages you have to add tests for that kind of bugs. In a strongly typed language the compiler does this instead. Sometimes using a strongly typed language can be a big hassle and lead to more code that in turn increase risk of bugs. Frontend development is one such area, it is often requires fast paced development and languages like Javascript, python, ruby, and PHP is fine for that. A trading backend for a Bitcoin exchange really isn't a place PHP, or the other script like languages for that matter, excels. It really is only a question of the right tools for the job.

Bitcoin is still little more than a proof of concept. All the risk is on the users. Expect insurances etc when, not before but when, there's a need for it and people in general trust it. The value of bitcoin may well be 0 in a couple of months.
And to be honest, it IS easy to securely store bitcoins. I could easily hide $2 000 000 worth of bitcoins (if I had that amount that is) in my lamp if I wanted to. I haven't got a slightest clue even where to fit $2 000 000 in my home. Of course I would want to store those in a bank account with people with the equipment needed to secure that amount and insure me against thievery. But with bitcoin there is no need to yet. If I want to, I can secure them. If I don't do that I wouldn't care to secure my regular cash either. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 11:45:04
Bip 70 transactions sorta will solve this. In this case the store broadcasts the transaction to everyone including miners. If they detect any conflicting transactions, which for it to matter for double spends will happen withing seconds or even already have happened, they call the cops. It's still illegal to rob stores even if you happen to use Bitcoin and not guns.

There was never a problem. You create a TX and broadcast it and when a TX from your address is made it is noted in the clients. The way wallets are supposed to work is to keep track of the amount of bitcoins tied to a address by looking at the blockchain. Mt.Gox simply assumed that if a transaction ID has timed out the address it is not sent. However a transaction not being included in a block indicates something is very wrong! 
Consider you make a transaction from a wallet of your choice. The transaction is never included. The first thing you do is check if your balance is the same and if any bitcoins have arrived to the recipient. Any sane person would do this and any programmer worth his salt would somehow alert when discrepancies like this happens. Mt.Gox doesn't, probably because their system is so buggy they just assume it's due to their crappy code and retry. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 07:49:15
That would force them to release the public key and then they should still move to coins so no one have the public key to the addresses (only the hashes).

It's all really about convenience vs security. Now I've not looked into how this wallet works but in general a 4 digit pin that cannot be used for anything critical coupled by a 2 factor auth for anything else is more secure than having one 2FA for everything. It's really about probability. The authentication method mostly used has the highest chance of being compromised and the most common operation is non critical things like looking up balance.

Personally I've modified a Ubuntu live dist to run everything from RAM allowing me to remove the USB stick and let it execute on a computer with no permanent storage attached at all. I also generated my own private keys using a set of dices and bip38 encrypted (with bit2factor, try it!) my paper wallets and stored them at different locations. A bit over engineered for the amount I'm storing perhaps. But fun nonetheless! 
Oh, and I also keep a QR encoded private PGP key in a safe deposit box that my relatives have access to in case I die. I have the public key on my computer and can encrypt Facebook passwords and such and store securely on the Web or wherever. This way my relatives have access to most of my stuff when I die.

I would recommend learning a bit about how transactions work, how signatures and such things are done. It is true that today Bitcoin is insecure and vulnerable to hacking.
But it is in fact childishly easy to make it secure. It is the matter of building offline signing devices (much like the trezor) capable of communication, wired or wireless using e.g. Bluetooth or NFC. Private keys will never touch unsafe internet connected devices, such as computers or cellphones, but will be stored inside hardware that signs transactions not unsimilar to how the microprocessors of credit and debit cards already works today.
In this hypothetical bitcoin future, there will be plenty of institutions devoted to securing as well as insuring stores of bitcoin. Remember the system does not have to be perfect. There does not have be exactly zero attack vectors. The system we have today is extremely insecure but it works, because any insecurities are taken into account when designing the services we use. There is no such thing as no risk. We might well all die from any inconceivable missfortune in the near future for all what it matters.

As you quoted, it is easy to make it secure. That does not mean it is secure today. Please read the explanation of a secure system. How can you steal something you do not have access to?


Well look at money transaction today, there are tons of different value transferring services for every imaginable use case (PayPal, Western Union etc). But these are all specialized services. There exist no uniform way of transacting value. For any unimaginable use case, that is a any service or utility that does not fall into any of the traditional categories, you have to create your own service. Think about Apple's App store or Google's Play Store. They had to invent their money transferring systems. It is incredibly hard and expensive and not anything an entity less than a multinational company is capable of. But give me (or rather someone more versed in programming for mobile platforms) a few weeks and he will create a fully operational application market place using Bitcoin as sole payment system.
Think about it, in order to accomplish such a mundane task as transacting tokens of value, we have to take a pick from hundreds of services (Visa, WU, PayPal, MoneyGram, SEPA, International Wire transfers, Google Wallets and whatevertransfer). Historically transferring value has not been much harder than regular communication! But today communicating with someone (like yourself right now) is very easy. Transferring value to you is hard enough that the majority of people will not bother. It is completely and utterly ridiculous! 
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:03:47
Of course now you are just making a fool out of yourself. You do realize you don't need the entire blockchain right? How do you think that work for phones?
But here's a simpler scheme. You want to pay something so you whip out your card like device and place it somewhere in the vicinity of the payment terminal. Couple with some kind of pin authentication or similar and the card like device signs a transaction, sends it to the. payment device (that could be a metro payment terminal, or a vending machine, or an app of a modern smartphone) which broadcast the transaction to other nodes of the bitcoin network. 
This is perfectly possible. Really it is. There's loads being done to simplify payments using bitcoin. It can be improved in so many ways. But it already works.

My landlord does not accept cheques because they do not want handle the extra amount of work regarding accounting that would require. If I physically show up at my bank office (during their office hours which happen to coincide with my office hours) I will be able to pay, by first exchanging it into my local currency and waiting for it to clear. My landlord will certainly not accept it. Why? Because their systems are not designed for cheques.

A simple NFC card is not enough.  You don't actually want to transfer the private key at all. It's quite easy actually. The payment receiver creates a transaction and send it to a device (via NFC, BLE, mechanical, whatever) where it is signed (after some kind of authentication) and sent back to the receiver who can broadcast the signed transaction. This way the private key cannot be compromised. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:23:48
But that's the thing, there is a gazillion of service trying to bridge the problems with traditional banking (that is transferring money).

Well for starters it is easier to build hardware with a nfc transceiver than a camera and QR codes. You wouldn't want the private key in the open at all. 
Consider a high frequency payment system (think metro station or Highway toll station). The payment stations can't wait for a transaction to be broadcast and relayed and hopefully reach the station. What you want is for the payment station to create a transaction or a payment request which is sent to the paying "smart" device for signing. The signed transaction is directly relayed to the payment station. This two way communication cannot reliably be done using QR codes.

Now automate this. There's just a few steps and it is very easy to automate. Remember we have mobile phones, smartwatches, ASIC miners, computers, these little 2 factor devices used by banks. Why on earth would it be hard to create a device with a tiny microprocessor doing a simple task such as a couple of iterations of SHA256 and ECDSA signing? That just does not make any sense!
