If you want to buy off the exchanges, yes. Buying off individuals (friends, localbitcoin etc), no.

One of the best use cases currently is for online gaming. I use it with various poker sites and sportsbooks. Many people would probably argue that it's bad because it allows 'illegal' online gaming to function much better, but as a libertarian and a professional gambler I much prefer it that way :)

do you buy things with bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-06-04 00:14:10
Bitpay is terrible, but my workaround for when I need to use them is send the money to electrum then use it. It sucks to have to do it like this, bitpay fix yo shit
@_date: 2019-08-15 02:38:47
This is what I came here to say, and what is clearly missing. You can't laugh at a 2% move when it's around 3/4 of your total market cap. Bitcoins wild swings are actually because in the grand scheme of things it's a pissant asset. I say this as a bitcoin (and gold, and stocks) owner.

just get your own wallet, theres no downsides to it but allows you to take control of your own security and removes whatever % chance that this guy loses or steals your coins
@_date: 2018-03-10 00:34:57
it is inflation
@_date: 2018-03-14 02:01:41
eh, this is a bit drastic. idk the business but short term this makes you extremely uncompetitive, having a btc option and promoting that is great, but forcing ppl to use only btc is not going to go well right now
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:25:47
Why did you put your families whole wealth on a crypto exchange?
@_date: 2018-03-13 01:00:45
just blissfully ignore all of that and take a long term view 
@_date: 2018-03-24 00:30:32
they think its deflationary because the supply is capped at 21 million and wont grow beyond that. assuming people lose coins then it is deflationary.

If 1 BTC is worth $10 million, its probably due in large part to hyperinflation. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 07:26:11
This x 1 million. Such a bad attitude to take that everyone should just hoard their coins forever (or at least until they appreciate).
@_date: 2018-02-19 13:54:16
This is a bad attitude to have. IMO BTC has to be used in transactions to have long term success, so even if you believe it will appreciate, you should still try to spend. If everyone just hoards coins that have little use/adoption, it will (perhaps has?) just result in a speculative bubble. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:07:25
can someone explain how this works? not that i want to see this, but how does one insert and/or view a picture on the bitcoin blockchain? 
@_date: 2018-03-23 17:04:57
if 1 satoshi is $1, $1 is probably worthless
@_date: 2018-03-19 22:14:02
The transfer hasn't completed immediately, but they can see its been initiated and it cant be cancelled (in some peoples eyes this is a drawback to BTC). The fees have come down a lot now, apps/wallets that set fees shouldn't be more than 20 cents now, and you can set it to less manually and it will still go through.
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:37:09
.0015 BTC, fee of 0.000025 BTC (which was what the app automatically suggested, I didn't alter it). Once it showed up on the app from their end (a few seconds) I left.

Used BTC to buy something irl for the first time. If anyone is in Bangkok, I definitely recommend going to Bad Burger. They might hold the bitcoins too actually; they weren't using any service that auto converted to fiat, instead converted the THB amount to BTC then got me to send that to their wallet directly. The process needs to be a bit more efficient, but I'm glad to support the system and any merchants who come on board. I think adoption and daily use is the key for long term success.
@_date: 2018-03-19 22:09:51
Converted THB to BTC using xe.com. They'd do this at point of sale every time.
@_date: 2018-02-09 12:03:56
umm, depends how we're framing it. if the goal is better cost efficiency then private prisons will be better, thats why governments will subcontract. it does create poor incentives though.
@_date: 2018-02-09 12:05:40
i think people these days are probably way more open to big government, willing to accept it and encourage it than generations previous, dont you think? people in crypto are largely libertarian, especially the earliest adopters, but we arent represenative of society at large, or even our generation necessarily
@_date: 2018-03-19 16:01:33
Good stuff. Bad Burger is a good place to spend some BTC here, and you can eat for more like $10 instead of $200 :p
@_date: 2018-07-03 06:17:50
ive used this numerous times, but ended up stopping because the fees are way too high (~6%)

why are u guys all jerking off over paypal here? between how slow everything is, the fees, horrible exchange rates (for ppl who only do usd transactions maybe you never notice this, but its basically a hidden 4-6% fee) and locking peoples accounts, they're terrible. i really
hope they, along with ewallets like skrill and neteller, are forced to become more competitive or go out of business due to crypto adoption ��
@_date: 2018-04-06 17:26:29
so in the US you can receive money on paypal and cash it out to your bank and receive it instantly? 
@_date: 2018-04-06 13:26:17
not sure how to quote, but it's not instant to get the money from paypal&gt;bank, at least in australia (3-5 business days), and most of what you want to buy you need to use cash or card, so having it on paypal isn't that useful.

no they wont, at some point they kill the currency and try again, and in a few decades everyone forgets and the cycle repeats ��
