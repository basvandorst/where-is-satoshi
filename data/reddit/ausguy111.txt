2 questions about BTC in general related to why I am worried its flawed:
1) Currency exchange is only possible if currency is bought and sold and the value is speculative, ie. currency value is unpredictable. By design BTC is deflationary so over long term the value will always go up: sure there are a few humps along the way as we are seeing now, but arent BTC users worried that ppl will just invest in the currency and then hold onto coins forever? ie. We know the value will go up, so wheres the fun in buy/selling (once it is mature)
2) THe amount of BTC on the market is too restricted, 2 years in and we are already at 50% market capitalisation and 2040 will be the last coin released. What about coins that are lost or held onto? There will be heaps. By the nature of the strength of the crypto we are already seeing tonnes of ppl forgetting the pass code to their wallets and losing 1000's of coins when they were worth nothing. Those coins are now lost. The currency is too rare. 21 mill coins worldwide is not enough. Currently we are all relying on a set limit. I am worried it was too conservative and we may need human interjection of more coins. Does the bitcoin protocol allow for any 'fix' for such? If not i believe it is doomed.
Great idea, great design, great crypto. GReat as an underground/ non popular currency, but its gotten too big and the economics are borken.

Can anyone link me to good sites/sources for peeps who understand and are discussing the economics of BTC?
It seems we are all geeks and bitcoin is like our first experience in trading. I have so many questions that I want to ask someone who KNOWS BITCOIN and FUTURE ECONOMICS of it
(the fact it is deflationary/forever going to rise makes it doomed imo, but I want someone to offer an alternative
kthx bai
