Dang that's a lot all at once. I maxed out around 4 but I think overall I could have had way more. When SR shut down my family's shared account had just hit 10k$ spent. Btc were around 150-200 then. So about 50btc spent. So at the current price it comes out to  850000. Ofc that was over the three year life span of SR, but a rough estimate. Lol drugs and good memories at least, that's what I keep telling myself haha

I think people are forgetting the massive amount usage bitcoin is getting as a currency due to the black market. When SR shut down the [FBI estimated]( that SR was taking in $650000 a day, making about $1.2 billion between 2011 and 2013. And that was how many years ago? Now there are so many more dark net markets and underground trades happening. 
People need to learn what agorism is and they'll learn why btc is so successful.

I was there as well, and I don't recall the hitmen being in SR. Are you not confusing onion wiki and all the links you could find while on tor for those hitmen? That's the only place I remember them being. The only thing related with SR would be the armory but that was for guns and even that was full of scammers and not generally considered legitimate. I don't remember hitmen being an orderable service that you could buy from SR specifically, and I was really really active in those forums.
