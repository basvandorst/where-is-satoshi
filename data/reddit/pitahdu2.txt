Props to him for the hashcash algorithm, he is a very smart cryptographer.  But he also claims he knew about Bitcoin in the early days and wrote it off and did not take it seriously.  He didn't even buy any bitcoins until the price was about $150.  So you have to wonder if he has the same vision as Satoshi.  Satoshi always said there would be larger blocks once SPV clients were popular.  Satoshi even worked on something similar to lightning network that would be used for high frequency transactions for stock markets and the like.

A few minutes ago I could have sworn it had like 65 upvotes, now zero that fast?  Something is fishy.  This thread deserves attention whether its satoshi or not we have to get to the bottom of it.

Seems true insanity.  Just made a thread about Bitcoin XT, the thread is being blocked and censored.

This is bullshit where did the Mike Hearn thread go.

How dare you use common sense logic.

wow your an idiot.  People will leave this sub and make a different one or use voat if this keeps up.  People are pissed, lol.  You think this is going to last?  We the people run this sub, and we want free speech.  If reddit or the mods don't provide it we will go elsewhere, simple as that.  The reason reddit has been so popular over the years is they allow free speech here.

I tried voat but it says I need to be invited.  How does that work?

That is when someone tries hiding and evading to avoid press or publicity.  But it ends of backfiring because the act of evading and hiding peaks more interest and more publicity.

Is this thread being censored or manipulated on I don't see it on front page anymore.
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:05:44
unilateral, as in the unilateral decision to censor any discussion.  Seems pretty fucking childish.

Man I wish the real satoshi would please stand up and blast these 1MBs out of the water using a signed message.  
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:32:28
Unforutnately the thread regarding this was also censored earlier, so we couldn't verify the validity of the claims.  No PGP signed key and other red flags like the email provider no longer existing makes this quite questionable.

Always voice of reason.
