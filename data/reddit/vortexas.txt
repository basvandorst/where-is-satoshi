And what happens to the surplus mining equipment. A 50% reward reduction should result in a lot of surplus equipment. Enough to make a potential attacks significantly cheaper. 
Also take a look at [this chart]( The only way that number comes down is with more transaction volume and doubling every 20 months isn't going to do it.

Check again how fast hashing power is increasing. With 2% of todays mining power, you could mine the entire chain from the genesis block to today in ~100months. Of course if the 2% lead is maintained this number comes down even further because its 2% of a increasing quantity whereas the past work is constant. Haven't done the math on that for a while but its something like a 2% lead would allow you to completely catch up with the main chain in 12 months.

So with Bitcoin the culture of throwaway products (which permeates technology today) will apply to everything? 
You need 10 years of lighting. Imagine light bulb A and B. A lasts 10 per year and costs $10, while B lasts 5 years and costs $5.
With 2% inflation using A will cost $10, while B will cost $10.50. ($5 today + $5*1.02^5 in 5 years time)
With 2% deflation using A will cost $10, while B will cost $9.50. ($5 today + $5*0.98^5 in 5 years time)
As you can see the long lasting bulb is only preferred when there is inflation. This is because the the quality bulb (A) still stores $5.50 of value after 5 years. This is a better store of value than hoarding the extra $5.00 which could have been saved by buying bulb B.

Or there is a cascading effect. Since they think the transaction failed they also believe they still have a unspent output available. When they try to use the already spent output again for a honest customer the transaction fails. As they get scammed again and again their wallet implementation diverges more and more from reality until things get really out of hand and they finally discover the root problem.

These are both from a thread that hit the frontpage which was warning people to get their [money out]( The top comment wasn't "Yes everyone please remove your money".

Its also misleading if they don't understand what a popular addresses is and how arbitrary it is to remove the top 100 from the stats.

From a consumers perspective credit card transactions have a negative cost, as in they get cash rewards for using them. Doesn't mean credit cards have better transaction costs.

Wow that would be terribly frustrating if true. I mean they could probably demonstrate beyond a shadow of a doubt that those coins belong* to them, but without the key its unspendable and might as well not exist on the blockchain. 
If everyone (~~&gt;51% of hashing~~) agreed that those coins belong to MtGox and a exception was made to release them to a new address all the MtGox users could be made whole again. But of course that kind of exception is a dangerous precedent and completely unacceptable in what should be a completely agnostic system. Bitcoin is impartial and just but not at all merciful, and that is the way it must be.

1btc=1e8 satoshis;
The satoshis rewarded in the final 9 eras are.
1,2,4,9,18,37,74,149,298 per block.
The final 8 eras together reward 294*210000=6.174e8
The 9th to last era would supply the remainder in 128390 blocks.
So with 210000*8+128390 blocks remaining (34.4 years) there will be only 1 BTC left to reward.
This would take place in 2105 but the schedule is already a bit ahead so perhaps it will take place in 2103.
**So the last entire bitcoin will be mined during the years 2103-2138.**

Why would you compare Forex transactions to the BTC market cap, wouldn't it make more sense to compare Forex transactions to the BTC exchanges trade volume for the year. That would be 1460T vs 1.49B. Still shows lots of room for growth.
If the measurement is $/year then don't compare it with $. That cancels out quite a few of them. Stocks and bonds have a $ value but can never be replaced by BTC so that comparison is kind of useless in my opinion.

You need to think about this for a longer period of time. Lets look at this in chucks of 2016 blocks. 
Single Chunk: As you argue in any given chunk the selfish mining gives the worst return, which is correct, and as you say this is regardless of difficulty ("**The difficulty does not matter.**"). I agree. 
Two Chunks: Now there are 4 possiblities. Using the notation H (honest), S (selfish), we have HH, SS, HS and SH. Ranking these 4 strategies from best to worst we would have HH&gt;SH&gt;SS&gt;HS. Again being honest is the best bet. 
Ten Chunks: Now there are a ton of combinations, but I suggest the two important ones to compare are HHHHHHHHHH and SSSSSSSSSH. If you compare the payoffs for different chunks you will note the selfish strategy does better in every chunk except the first. The selfish miner sacrifices the first chunk to gain an advantage. For every block after that the maximizing move would be returning to honest mining (as you point out **difficulty doesn't matter**), but that choice would simply be trading a long term advantage for a gain in a single chunk.

If KNC miner were a malevolent actor could they have outpaced the rest? Was the investment+sales in KNC miner anywhere near $1 Billion. 
EDIT: Also a 15% discount rate is insane. In the past year difficulty has increased by 150x and prices have increased by 30x. That works out to 1-30/150=80%. That is 80% before you factor in machines dying. Running the numbers with 80% discount rate I came up with $425 million.

Ok then this analysis is worthless if it doesn't include difficulty or changing bitcoin prices. A 20GH/s miner isn't worth 20GH/s/4.5PH/s*(npv of all future mining), because the hash rate isn't constant. But that is exactly what this analysis is saying.

Ok, I agree this will be the correct model once we reach equilibrium. I only will hold one reservation, because it might turn out that the malevolent actor does have a cost advantage.
We tend to assume the best hardware for a 51% attack is also the preferred hardware for mining. While this will be true for the near future it will probably not be true indefinitely. An attacker wants hardware with the highest GH/$ while a miner wants the best combination of GH/$ and GH/watt. Currently GH/watt isn't a huge consideration for miners so their preference aligns with the attackers preference. However as GH/watt becomes important to miners, the hardware preference will diverge. An attacker can get by with cheaper less energy efficient hardware.

How premined? Coins would be introduced by destroying paper-money and generating coins in a 1-to-1 relationship. Mining rewards are not needed to distribute the money supply in this scenario. Minings only reward (assuming they choose proof-of-work) would be transaction fees.

Not living in China, but here are my observations.
What I learned from Companies like Baidu are accepting it for payments.
What I learned when I researched myself: A division of Baidu called Jiasule which provides a security service against ddos attacks is accepting bitcoin. So far they have received around 36 payments (mostly dust spam) totalling 1.3BTC. (around $200 at time of payment)
I may be wrong but I think China mostly uses bitcoin to get around their governments currency export restrictions.

They will also back their crypto-currency with their paper-currency, so I can exchange 1 crypto-dollar with 1 paper-dollar. People will love that kind of stability.

It also a stupid argument because the real reason lightbulbs aren't as durable anymore is they are designed for efficiency. A thick filament may last longer but its going to waste way more energy.
Finally its a really stupid argument because of the following example. You need 10 years of lighting. Imagine light bulb A and B. A lasts 10 per year and initially costs $10, while B lasts 5 years and initially costs $5. 
With 2% inflation using A will cost $10, while B will cost $10.50.
With 2% deflation using A will cost $10, while B will cost $9.50.
As you can see the long lasting bulb is only preferred when there is inflation. This is because the the quality bulb (A) still stores $5.50 of value after 5 years. This is a better store of value than hoarding the extra $5.00 which could have been saved by buying bulb B.

Here is the code....
 
       var n_periods_first = 420000 - height; // # blocks before next halving
        var n_periods = 210000; //# blocks before halving
        var blocks_per_year = 54650;
        var transaction_fee_revenue = .0114; //% of total revenue earned from transaction fees
        var effective_discount_rate = 0.15;
        var payment = price;   //current price of bitcoins
        var stated_discount_rate = (Math.pow((effective_discount_rate + 1), (1 / blocks_per_year)) - 1) * blocks_per_year;
        var discount_rate_per_block = stated_discount_rate / blocks_per_year;     //discount rate divided by blocks per year
        var plus_discount = 1 + discount_rate_per_block;
        var reward = 25;            //current block reward
        var total_discounted = 0;
        var exponent_first = Math.pow(plus_discount, -(n_periods_first));
        var exponent = Math.pow(plus_discount, -(n_periods));
        remaining_reward = ((payment * reward) / (1 - transaction_fee_revenue)) * ((1 - exponent_first) / discount_rate_per_block);
        while (reward &gt; 0.00000001) {
            reward /= 2;
            next_reward = ((payment * reward) / (1 - transaction_fee_revenue)) * ((1 - exponent) / discount_rate_per_block);
            total_discounted += next_reward / Math.pow(1 + discount_rate_per_block, n_periods);
            n_periods += 210000;
        }
        npv = (remaining_reward + total_discounted) * .51;
        table_cap = npv/1000000;
In the while loop we have this...
    total_discounted += next_reward / Math.pow(1 + discount_rate_per_block, n_periods);
**next_reward** is the value of the total reward for a halfing period taken at the start of each period. This is then discounted to npv by dividing by **"Math.pow(1 + discount_rate_per_block, n_periods)"**, where **n_periods** should be the number of blocks from the present to the Nth halving event. 
It should be..
Rather than....
A simple way to see the current implementation is incorrect is to recognize **total_discounted** has no dependence on the **height**. In reality as we get closer to the next halving the amount of discounting should be decreasing, so there should be dependence.
