What price do the fundamentals support then? 
Speculation of future growth effects every type of investment whether it’s cryptocurrency, stocks, real estate, etc. You can’t expect the book value based on fundamentals to equate how valuable the market perceived the asset to be. In an ideal world, that would make sense. But, human psychology impacts the fair value (one way or another) more than you’d expect.
Futures are going live this month. That is possibly the catalyst causing this increase. But, no one really knows man

Thank you for saying this. It was clearly an intentional ploy to confuse the general public about bitcoin, and cryptocurrency in general.
How would most of us react if someone innocently said “oh, yeah. I saw a guy talking about that bitcoin cash thing on CNBC.” If we knew he was misguided, then I’m sure people would be more than happy to help.  But his ignorance would more likely result in a response like “THAT’S A SCAM COIN!!!! STOP CALLING IT BITCOIN, IT’S BCASH YOU NITWIT!!”
While I think that’s a perfect response to the intentional fraudsters, CNBC knows exactly what they’re doing, and they’re trying to manipulate the market by shaking the confidence of retail investors.

No, but it’s probably a lot more comforting for OP to hear the likely cause as opposed to thinking that they stole his money

Yeah, that’s a solid strategy if you invested in 2013 and have since retired with no other source of income.
