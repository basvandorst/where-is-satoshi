He should make another one for this year, but with a lambo behind him and some shades on
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:20:44
You are correct. Back when it was running from 4K to 10K, I bought at 5K and the transfer took 8 days. I got the bitcoin at the 5K price, but the current price was 7K. I had profited when the funds arrived
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:22:46
Honestly, it has SAVED me money to chill out during dips. I have grown confident that bitcoin will recover from dips like this. Also, since I'm a college premed student, I don't need the added stress. lol

Thanks bro! I was thinking about selling btc at 18k and rebuying at 16k, but it wasn't worth the risk of getting stuck in the coinbase system imo. Safest bet currently for most people is to hodl
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:39:11
Thanks man. I’m totally aware of the gamble I’m taking, but I only looking to multiply my input. I got in at 5k, so I’m a bit more fortunate than many 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:09:28
It was because of whale dumps from the past day or so
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:55:15
So is there a way to predict that the bottom will be that low, or do you have to ride it out through the $16800 head and shoulders?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:58:39
I don't want to be the negative nancy, but that red candle scares me. BUT I WILL CONTINUE TO HODL!!! BITCOIN IS LOVE

The Whitepaper is incomparable to other coins’. It has a core purpose as a way to store value in a genius way. 10/10 do recommend reading.

My man!!! ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:50:16
I'm asking this just for sake of understanding how to read these. How do you know that the bottom wasn't at the $16800 mark? It looks like two large dips, but why aren't those considered as bull traps?

So, if I have BTC in Electrum offline wallet, do my coins still benefit from the fork. How does it work?
