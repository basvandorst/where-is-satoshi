You make it sound like regulation is a bad thing
@_date: 2014-07-05 22:48:38
Not only is it an observable fact, it was designed intentionally and transparently. We try to match inflation with growth. It's a good thing. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 23:20:54
The fact that your lying, makes me question this whole movement. 
If he was innocent people wouldn't have to make things up to defend him. 
I'm going to start a movement to keep that fucker in jail for good. See what you did?
@_date: 2014-04-09 22:15:41


Well of course not.  The point is that they THINK they are being pragmatic, while they're really not. 


Well maybe you surround yourself with different people, I don't know.  But to me, and I think most would agree, if someone has a different view that is based on assumptions, then yes it seems unreasonable.  But if someone has a different view that has supporting evidence, then it does not seem unreasonable.  Its the excessive use of assumptions that makes an ideology unreasonable, not the fact that it is a different point of view.
Again I might surround my self with different people, but in science, if you dismiss everyone with a different view than yours, then you're not going to go very far.


Thats kind of the definition of belief right? Faith? People who believe in ideologies become entrenched, and can't even have a conversation about the validity of said ideology.  If you have an opinion, and someone gives you evidence to dismiss the opinion, I think most people would start questioning their opinion rather than just being defensive. 
edit: grammar

How can bitcoin replace the fed? They serve two very different purposes. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 07:37:50
They're just touching each other's wieners

I'm sorry but republican and libertarian economics are not based in the real world.  The free market will not solve all of our problems. 
The world is not black and white.  There are some regulations that are bad, and there are some regulations that are good (I have more examples of beneficial regulations than deleterious ones).
If you think solutions to problems this complex are so easy...I have a bridge to sell you.

You should have said: "Because inflation and credit expansion may/may not cause malinvestment, which may/may not cause the bubble/bust cycles."
@_date: 2014-07-09 03:21:48
Exactly! Why people don't understand this is beyond me
@_date: 2014-07-10 22:12:12
This.  It's called confirmation bias
@_date: 2014-04-09 20:38:43
I think most people are pragmatic - they realize there are no absolutes in our system.  There are some aspects that are bad, and some that are good; some that need to be changed and improved upon, and others that need to be abandoned.
When you speak in absolutes, have unwavering faith in an ideology (no matter what it is), people look at you like an extremist.  
@_date: 2014-04-20 23:36:11
They only know how to regurgitate.  Wake up! Sheeple! Stop drinking the kool-aid!  Blah blah blah
@_date: 2014-04-21 06:21:34
Yes, but blaming boom/bust cycles on inflation is pretty silly 
@_date: 2014-04-30 04:13:06


I can see you take that to heart
@_date: 2014-03-21 23:31:21
Your analogy doesn't make any sense.  He was saying that the flow of credit is possible because of the banking system.  The ability to use cotton for clothing is not dependent on the use of slave labor.
@_date: 2014-04-20 23:04:59
My thought exactly ;)
@_date: 2014-04-12 20:25:38
That's the sound of the Drabble joke going over your head
@_date: 2014-04-20 23:42:55
Fuck you liar
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:32:11
It's really off putting when every time you try to have a civil conversation with a libertarian, they get emotional. 
It alienates people; seems almost cultish. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 23:38:13
I like you
@_date: 2014-07-05 21:13:19
Inflation is not a conspiracy 
@_date: 2014-04-21 00:36:55
Why the hell are you being downvoted for this?
@_date: 2014-04-01 02:43:22
Say it 592 times.
@_date: 2014-07-09 03:18:47
You know what really grinds my gears? When people compare the national debt to personal debt. Apples and oranges. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 23:41:06
Wait, the mainstream isn't going to accept us if we pretend taxation is ok?  
Seriously dude, did you even read that.
@_date: 2014-03-26 20:44:30
Why don't we just vote with our....votes? Crazy concept I know, but not every regulation is bad. Don't be an ideologue.  Some are good, some are bad. 
I like this idea actually; if you purchase something you should be free to use it as you wish. 
@_date: 2014-04-25 22:19:11
Nick is that you?
@_date: 2014-04-23 06:57:32
No, the mainstream accepts taxation period. We vote for taxation because it is necessary. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 17:44:42
The name...kinda hard to say. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 07:21:49
Your not going to get any up votes bc it's not what they want to hear 
@_date: 2014-04-21 00:22:27
I don't believe you
@_date: 2014-04-21 06:09:22
aaaaand BOOM GOES THE DYNAMITE!
@_date: 2014-04-21 00:24:05
No. No its not
@_date: 2014-04-20 23:33:37
Uh no that's more of a tactic than a logical fallacy.  You sound like you're pretty young
@_date: 2014-04-21 06:30:07
I don't know when this sub was taken over by libertarians...but Im calling it: 4/20/14

Watch my karma melt away...

aand were does it say we can't listen to others?
@_date: 2014-04-20 23:59:05
Geez the sister could at least TRY.  Maybe you should speak from the heart next time and not from a pre-typed out speech? Maybe you could take off your shirt? I'm sure your brother would approve of that, as long as it brought in money of course 
@_date: 2014-04-08 09:03:01
I'm a big-government Liberal and I love bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-05-03 21:21:17
Ya that's what my drug dealer in Compton always tells me
@_date: 2013-11-17 01:23:02
This video is a little biased.  Anyone can buy a treasury bond, not just a bank.  Also not all government spending is deficit spending; They can spend their surplus when there is one.
@_date: 2013-11-17 04:10:05
The Fed isn't private. Its both private/public.  Governors are appointed by the president and approved by the senate. 
But I agree, the system is corrupt. I don't think the problem is the type of currency, however;  Its corporatism and paid off politicians not working for the people.
I think we would still have that problem if gold, silver, or even bitcoin were used as the main currency.  Not sure how to solve it, but i'm pretty sure were looking in the wrong places.
Oh and long live bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:05:51
Sales tax? Shit i don't know thats a good question.
What about receiving bitcoins as a tip??
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:25:48
I should have bought at $515, now they are $517
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:31:09
Why is it improbable for the top 1% to own more than 10% of the coins?  It seems that the trade volumes are large enough, and over time, a wealthy individual could amass a, well mass, of coins.
Its a serious question, I don't really know.
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:08:32
I know its hard to believe, but most people do not identify with libertarian ideology.  Its not a conspiracy against non mainstream candidates....its just too radical and unattractive to most people.
@_date: 2013-11-16 10:36:02
Will it go down, or will it go up?
@_date: 2013-11-17 01:26:50
Lucky SOB
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:43:30
No way coinbase is $506
@_date: 2013-11-21 08:54:37
I like the pile of bitcoins
@_date: 2013-11-16 10:44:56
Am I missing something, or is the fact that Bitcoins are indirectly linked to other larger currencies make unequal wealth distributions possible, if not probable?
Someone who has a lot of USD can buy quite a few coins
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:19:32
So long and thanks for all the fish

CoInvalidation...suck my invalid bitcoins
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:34:12
haha! I like looking at old threads about bitcoin....so many wrong predictions. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 19:17:33
This price increase has been ridiculous, I've been waiting for a crash but I don't think a significant crash is going to happen anytime soon
@_date: 2013-11-17 18:47:39
Interesting. I didn't know that other countries did that.
I can only speak from experience, and I know I can directly buy a treasury bond in the US (one of the best investments I've made). Actually, the myth that banks own the majority of our sovereign debt is perpetuated, to the death, by Republicans and Libertarians. Its just not true. As of August 30th, banks own about $341.4 billion.  Private individuals own more than double that.
Just something to think about.
