I'd watch it. EXCITING!
(I'm lonely, reddit.... now that Breaking Bad is over... *sooo lonely..*)

There's obviously some money to be made doing it... after that report citing several times how much money he was making all by himself, I expect to be hearing about a bunch of those services soon.

I know this isn't how it works, but I think it'd be pretty sweet if the bitcoin community could basically just "destroy" seized currency and distribute it evenly to the rest of the economy. Fuck the police.

Let's just say he was no Walter White....

This seems to be the $1.2M question right now for the Tor community... I hope someone figures it out and explains it to me, I don't know anything about internet security but I think there should be a true bastion of safety for internet users somewhere.
EDIT: I don't know why this didn't occur to me before... but if this guy was really as dumb about internet security as that report makes him sound, it could be one of his "assistants" was a cop. It even says in the report that SR users felt that was a possibility when he decided to post for jobs.

Exactly. They were probably pretending they didn't have enough on him to encourage him to "defend" himself and talk. I can see him making the argument, "Well, I don't DO this buuut I HEARD there's this thing and anyone could..." etc.
Save that argument for the court room if you make it there, it's never helpful to tell a cop anything but harmless, vague, empty phrases and ask questions to deflect the conversation so that he can't call you uncooperative.

Yeaah... I don't like to don the tinfoil hat that often, but I was interested in this story and the whole time I felt like "this makes no sense... unless it's all just made up." Wish I had more faith in the US justice system, but I'd be not at all surprised to see him acquitted because someone showed police tampered with the evidence / made some of it up.
That or he was just really dumb.

He left nothing that could be used at all, anyway. The only way, even with Gale's book around, that Hank could prove it was if he could get more evidence, which did not exist.
Pretty far from if, say, Walt had signed for the equipment he took from the school at the beginning. (Or something more analogous to this guy using his personal e-mail/address in setting up the SR.)

This is where it makes no sense to me from the NSA point of view... what if he just paid it or tried to arrange something else? It seems like a weird step to take if you didn't know in advance the guy would jump (IMO completely irrationally) to "executing."


Again, doesn't make sense because that's not what happened. DPR went TO the redandwhite guy himself after he was already trying a few paths to get some fake IDs. There's no way that would have been predictable as a move.

In his defense... he wasn't at all. He majored in Physics and then went to Penn in MatSci for his grad... I guarantee you he learned programming in a very round-about manner to do simulations for his research and at best had a hobby knowledge of computer security. There's no way he was doing research at Penn and had spare time to screw around though, so he probably knew as much computer security as you could learn on the internet in a year or so (admittedly a pretty smart guy based on that academic record, but you can only learn so much so fast).
