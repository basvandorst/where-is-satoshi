I don't really understand the full details but Kim Dotcom usually can surprise me with his products and services, I'm excited to see what it is.

Increase the amount of Gwei you're willing to spend on transaction costs. 60Gwei right now is about right if you want to be fast.
Check  if you want to see whats right for the moment

As it should be
12 isn't as secure

Honestly I'd write down 48 words if I had to
Imagine this is the only thing needed to touch someone's $10k+
Even if it would take me a whole week it would still be profitable to steal

You should look at a fair balance between security, value of what's being protected and inconvenience 
24 is a sweet spot. It's secure and not too much of a pain in the ass.
48 would be decent but it gets more of a pain in the ass
96 does bring such marginal security increase to the pretty much uncrackable 24/48 while it brings a major inconvenience that it's unlikely to be used
@_date: 2015-12-27 12:40:31
Pretty sure this is the reason
@_date: 2018-08-27 11:14:25
I've never had this issue, pretty sure if you have your bootup set correctly it should run fsck on suspicion of filesystem issues or without a clean shutdown

"going green anyways"
Yeah we're far away from that we're barely at 10% while our usage is still increasing 
@_date: 2018-08-19 08:56:31
Not true at all, if one of my friends were suffering because the lack of money I would be more then willing to loan them some 
@_date: 2018-08-17 11:45:25
Says who? All signs currently point to that we're not moving even remotely fast enough to green energy to prevent it getting out of hand

Scammed me over 5.3BTC, never again.
@_date: 2017-08-26 20:53:44
I never had this happen to me :(
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:15:29
I honestly tried, sometimes a joke works sometimes not. I guess this one was a bit too late 
@_date: 2018-06-26 08:57:49
Yes, all the money I have in crypto is money I do not depend on. It's nice money but it's not the end of the world if I've lost it
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:44:15
More like $4 if you want that drink before the girls go home

I think decentralised currencies are the future because you can have 100% full control over your own money.
This doesn't mean I appreciate some kind of wild-west hitman and drug market.
@_date: 2018-07-31 08:44:16
Lifetime sounds extreme but when you run a big illegal marketplace you knew what you were going for
Play stupid games get stupid prices 
@_date: 2018-07-31 22:44:01
There were rape-drugs on silk road (Which is nearly never used on the person that bought it itself) and hitmen are just as illegal in person (As it should be!).
Its not black on white, some things are ok-ish because the person itself uses the product but there were various activities which would strongly impact the life of others that were not the purchaser 
@_date: 2016-05-30 14:05:13
should have bought more at 0.195 :(((
@_date: 2017-05-29 05:45:17
The fees right now are insanely high and people do not seem to make it as much of a problem then it actually is
Give me one reason to use bitcoin, while the confirmation speed is slower and the payment fees are higher then conventional payment methods? The only reason would be anonymity or if you live in a 3rd world country with a messed up currency
I've been a fan of bitcoin for many years but this is hurting bitcoin a lot

@_date: 2016-07-19 19:03:38
Damn only if I knew...
I asked people over at  @ irc.freenode and they gave me that advice
@_date: 2016-07-19 18:43:55
Send some more transactions, I had a transaction which has been stuck for a month by making the same mistake, got it fixed by sending 5, ~0.002BTC transactions (it still took 3 days after tho!)

Its morally wrong to remove his name from a article since he actually is part of the history, like it or not. This would lower the trustworthy of wikipedia as a source
