I used to think that bcash were like anti-vaxers but now I believe that they are almost certainly more dangerous to Bitcoin than that. 
 They have a campaign and are pretty ruthless in muddying the BTC waters.  We will end up giving them everything if this community keeps treating them as harmless kooks instead of the demonstrated threat that they actually are.

Moneybadger don't care. Bitcoin was built to accept attacks from every direction. This will be another learning experience for bcash. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:34:37
Yet I'm not in the least concerned. Bitcoin needs to be tested and just read the papers. The entire mainstream media is on the attack and it's pretty vicious. So what?  You want to pry the dead cold claws of wealth and privilege off our monetary system it is going to get a bit bloody in the process. 
Bitcoin ain't going anywhere, but it will cop some nasty kicks.  Some from the crypto world and many from the banking "system".
Those who can stand and be tested as the price floor takes a beating can forever more prove that we are just not in it for the money. We would all bail if we were.

I think that within 3 years another bcash tribe will organically emerge claiming that Bitcoin Cash has lost it's way and will hard fork from it. They will probably claim that bcash has lost the vision of the founding genius, Roger Ver. The 'Bitcoin Cash-Cash' coin is born. 
This will drive Roger Ver batshit crazy and he will say, "no it hasn't".  But, to no avail. The bcash  community will turn on this flank fighting this splinter group until it in turn, hard forks into the 'Ver Coin'.  
Bcash will end up as the Amish of the crypto world, growing weird beards and calling the rest of the crypto community the 'English'.

I would like nothing more, but as I said, one side is attempting to pollute the debate rather than argue the merits of the coins.

The entire shebang just celebrated its ninth birthday.

Think of the car or aircraft industries in their ninth year.  Did those flimsy aircraft have international service hubs in Singapore or Frankfurt? 
Another few years will sort most of these things out if people just let the development teams get to grips with them.  It's not as if you need to cash out bitcoins 20 times a day to buy a goddamned sandwich.

What the media label "bubble" could also be called a "price discovery ". What is happening now has never happened before. Although bitcoin mimics the stock market very closely, it isn't actually the same thing. And as bitcoin hasn't gone through an entire market cycle as yet, who knows what the real price may be?  
It could be worth $100 or $7 million. Nobody knows for sure and we won't know for a few years.  It will continue to crash and recover stronger because the market cap is still very puny by comparison with the share market. There is tons of room to grow, so hold on to your hat...
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:01:27

You have to be a realist.  Governments can have a deep impact upon bitcoin, mostly through on and off-ramps like turning coin into actual money to spend.  At some point money has to hit a gatekeeper unless technology changes real quick, and bitcoin ATMs would only be permitted to exist if data could be sent to regulatory agencies such as the tax office.

I don't think you are right in this, but I do think that you are right in that there will always be a contender for the bitcoin leader.  One day it will topple BTC, but that day is quite a bit off. 
Bcash is spruking a lot about cheap and fast transactions and they are right about that, but that edge vaporizes the same day that the lightning network comes on line.  On that day Bitcoin has the power of the legacy block-chain coupled with easy and cheap transactions.   So, Bcash has about a year to do it's dirty work, and I doubt that they can overturn the tables in time.

Nobody is actually arguing that it is NOT a bubble, but what exactly IS a bubble in this situation?  Can you have four year bubbles?  Who knows?  
I would like to know how, if all these experts are so damn knowledgeable about how Bitcoin is going to end up, why couldn't they predict the "bubble" as it is now.  Their future crystal ball is 20/20 on bitcoin at the moment - was it on the blink back in May?  Nobody can say what is happening with any certainty, but some motherfuckers are making a bet on an outcome with their own money and some are sitting on their butts on the sidelines mouthing off.

What premise? When I first responded your post was a whining sky falling troll.  
Ok, you want a fully mature transactional monetary system, today... right now, that addresses bcash's shrill. Got news for you... no crypto is at that stage yet. All of us are still using fiat or credit cards for everyday use. Want to pay for a haircut you use money. Want to buy lunch, use cash. Go to a movie, maybe credit card. Everybody uses cash/credit card for everyday stuff. That's where we are at.  As for expensive transaction fees... yeah true. Solution: try to to make micro transactions just yet. Use other mediums. Three separate development teams are working on the lightning network. It will take about a year to implement.  If you can't wait a year, sell out and buy bcash if that suits you better. Nobody will try and stop you.  In the meantime the Bitcoin train will leave the station without you.
 Just give the rest of us some goddamn peace. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:52:27
I dunno?  Many people are not vocalizing a radical sentiment about decentralization, but they also don't trust central banks and governments to the point where they are actively moving into an unknown and risky venture to try for a better life.  We are not the drug dealers which make up the mass media picture of bitcoin speculators.  We are the young and the middle class and, no doubt, a big bunch of whales.

Ok, so you are not a troll (probably).  I’ll treat your post with respect, so if you are, ya got me.
If you don’t mind me saying, nearly every second sentence you make informs the world that you don’t really understand bitcoin.  That’s ok, I studied it as a concept for almost six months before I was confident enough to dip my toe in the water.  There is quite a bit to get your head around.  Bitcoin is very different - very different - so the first battle is just getting your head around it.  Your first assault against it is your own intuition. It just doesn’t “sound correct”.  Forget the nuts and bolts of it all -  it just “feels” wrong, don’t it?  It is a very familiar feeling in human history.  Whenever an evolutionary concept breaks out, the initial attack against it is that it is not like the status que, so therefore impossible to function in that environment.  “I have this box, that thing doesn’t fit within this box, therefore that thing is not legitimate”.   
I’m not talking down to you, but it is like making grand pronouncements about the automobile when the industry was nine years old.  The car at that stage of its evolution looked like a portable shithouse on bicycle wheels.  It was smelly, slow and prone to breakdowns.  There was hardly any infrastructure to support it.  The roads, such as they were, existed of a strip of dirt held together by potholes and wagon ruts.  And that was inside the towns.  Highways were non-existent and forget about bridges in the great outdoors.  Every river crossing meant crossing a shallow ford no matter how inconvenient or out of the way.  There was almost no supply chain of spare parts and gas stations were far and few between.  It is little wonder that the most common comment was “get a horse”.  An automobile seemed like a crazy idea because the entire environment was hostile to the car.  Still, still… some visionaries persisted with the idea.  And no doubt many of them were crushed by the dreams of what may be.  In time, the value of the automobile actually created its own environment and thus the horse which had been mankind’s staple of transportation since 4000BC was largely made redundant in a couple of decades.   That’s called revolution and the old rules no longer apply.  
In my own time I’ve seen many changes and in each and every one of them I have dismissed on intuition grounds alone.  I admit to being an old fart, approaching 60, so my feet are littered with examples.  Email was invented by engineering nerds in 1972.  “Instant mail”, which, as you are probably an email native, would mean little to you.  But in my childhood any communication often took two weeks.  One week to send a letter and another week to hear back.  These engineering dudes were shooting off emails to each other and not thinking of making the concept go mainstream because who else at the time even had computers?  
In 1976, I first heard of the concept of a “computer in the home”.  I was 18 years old and in the army at the time.  I distinctly remember talking to a buddy about it.  How was it even possible?  I knew nothing about computers but believed them to be the size of minivans and so expensive that only banks and universities could afford them.  Why would people even want a computer anyway?  Who needs that kind of calculation power in their everyday life? It just didn’t “feel” right, and I didn’t bother thinking any more about it.  Just go back five years from now and the megalith of Netflix and other streaming giants didn’t even exist (well, let’s not quibble, Netflix did, but as a DVD rental outlet).    In fact, they couldn’t exist because there was no infrastructure to support them.  How could movies come into my house through a telephone line?  Weird, huh? 
Anyway, to address a few of your misconceptions.  A coin may (or may not) experience a fork.  It can either be a “hard fork” in which the coin splits off to become a new coin, or it might be a “soft fork” whereby the new blockchain rules are backwards compatible.  In either case this does nothing to the original market cap of the original coin.  In the case of Bitcoin (core) it has a limitation of 21 million coins to be rolled out until 2040.  That is deflationary by design.  Unlike Governments, you just can’t keep printing Bitcoin willy-nilly.  When Bitcoin Cash split off from Bitcoin it created its own market cap that had nothing to do with Bitcoin.  Weather it succeeds or not, or to the extent that is does or doesn’t is dependent upon the market.  Banks nor Governments nor financial institutions don’t get a vote. 
Lastly that Bitcoin isn’t “real”.  Every coin is attempting to solve a real problem that exists.  That is its value.  For example, the Ripple development team are trying to make large scale money transactions faster, safer, simpler and cheaper.  I can’t remember the rates, but it aims to reduce the costs by a significant amount.  Other coins are concentrating on small transactions sizes (so buying a coffee with bits of bitcoin is simple, cheap and boring).  Some coin teams are trying to solve identity issues and the list goes on.  They are more real than your supposedly ownership of Apple shares – all the company decisions are made without your input?  All you are doing is loaning Apple your money.  You don’t even own a doormat or a coffee mug in the staff kitchen.   
I don’t blame you for not getting it, it is real work trying to understand it.  If you have faith in the old market, you should probably stick with that if it makes you feel comfortable.

Then there are those who believe in the concept, invest a bit for that reason and don't expect million dollar payouts every two weeks.
I do feel sorry for those who get carried away by the hype.  The cold hard fact is that you can do your shirt in the non-bitcoin world too. Capital risk wasn't invented in 2009. 
 Sometimes money just slips through certain fingers. Bitcoin will look after those who are careful and who listen to what it is saying.
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:14:44
I don't doubt that they will seriously try, perhaps even fuck things around for quite a while. 2018 is going to be rocky. Very rocky. Try and see things from their perspective... they see bitcoin as a very dangerous virus. Bitcoin is puny really.  It's a third of the size of Facebook and a quarter of the size of Apple Corp. But, they fear what bitcoin is capable of, and they are right to be scared.  So, it will probably be a nasty covert battle.
The thing is, Bitcoin isn't going to lay down and get shafted. It will fight back by it's utility.  Millions believe in bitcoin and it has both strength and resilience.  It is also going to attract other capitalists who recognize it's value and promise.  I believe that it can't fail to win in the medium term. The blockchain is the secret powerhouse in the background.  It can do stuff, it has utility.  If Wall Street trys to pick a fight with blockchain I doubt if it will win. See how faithful the financial shareholders will be when bitcoin starts to gain traction. 
If I'm wrong, we are all screwed anyway, but I'm not worried.  Dig deep and ride out the 2018 storm.

I don't give financial advice because I'm probably more of a noob than you are.  I'm not saying that there will be a dip.  My opinion is that the coin is under soft institutional attack by the big banks/governments.  This is taking the form of terrible media remarks and vague threats of "regulation" which may mean a stab at "control"?  The entire thing is designed to unsettle confidence in the market.  
 The futures market is a Wall Street unknown, but they are no friend of crypto.   I don't know what will happen, nobody does.  They could bet against coin and bitcoin could bounce to the sky for all I know?  Or they could do their money which would be highly amusing, or they could upset the apple-cart and the price may drop to the floor.  Seek other advice and do your research.  I don't care either way.  I have confidence in crypto for a whole host of reasons.  I will stick with it come what may, but it is going to be a rocky 2018, I think.  Don't get seriously involved if you think that the ride is too scary.

I believe that you are probably right about the intention, and they may even succeed in the short-term, but have faith in the coin. It is designed to punch through market games. Also, the very velocity that we deal with every day is going to be a factor in the futures game. If we haven't a clue how the price will fall on any given day, it is going to be a brave stockbroker who bets upon nailing down a bitcoin price with cash money. The Wales might even be in a position to manipulate the futures? The day traders may get wreaked from both sides?

Assuming you are not a troll, your argument fails on the sword of your own logic.  If you were a Apple Corp investor, a good old blue ribbon stock, what "real work" would you have done to earn any money from that?  At time of writing, Apple Corp market capital is worth about 878.22 billion.  Bitcoin is worth about 185 billion.  Apple is worth over four times the entire bitcoin world, yet those investors are somehow legit and worthy of respect and us small time investors are involved in a ponzi scheme?  
Lastly, the 2007/2008 stock-market collapse and bank fraud gave birth to bitcoin.  The stock-market is the biggest Ponzi Scheme in the world.  And now it is afraid.  So sad.

I'm not so sure. They can't play the "great crash" scenario more than once. The burn that the banks caused in 07/08 is still remembered to this day, and even other banks don't trust banks anymore because of the selling of toxic mortgages. The other interesting thing about the 07 crash was the market had a profound low volitively. It was completely calm just before it all went west, which isn't a sign that economists expect in a bubble.  If the suggestion is that you can endlessly perform a 'pump and dump' and wring new blood out to dry I can't see it working.  The institutions and Wales will end up sitting on billions of worthless bitcoin tokens.  Can't think of a better way to lose wealth.

BTC will rocket and dive repeatedly but it will always seek equilibrium (look at the chart).  The volatility is not a bad thing in that it pushes prices along (and the "crashes" too).  But mass adoption cannot take too long or momentum is lost.  The crazy ride must be undertaken.  The Iphone mania revolutionized telephonic technology and changed the world forever.  Apple could not have done this gradually and court public opinion.  The Iphone crashed through the wall and demanded attention.  
Cars came before highways and gas stations.    Bitcoin is bursting ahead of its supporting infrastructure.  In a few years time who will even remember the birthing pains?
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:35:27
As it has been pointed out already, it is not as if you are willing to repay that kindness offered to you by giving your benefactor extra for "kindness" in return. So you make money from somebody else and wave goodbye? 
I have refrained from saying it until now, but you sound like a jerk and if anybody were to give you a single cent they would be rewarding you for being a jerk.

I hear what you are saying, but bitcoin is not gold.  Gold's primary value for the last 8000 years has been it's holding capacity.  A troy ounce has not significantly increased in value all that time (in buying power terms).  Bitcoin is both a currency and a mode of transaction, plus it is deflationary.  What this means in the long-term is beyond me?

It is not too late. Even bitcoin dust will rocket over time....
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:53:29
Everybody looks at the crashes and points their finger and bases their next sentence on that happening.   Why doesn't the old money look at the the regular gains and make a thought or two about that? The reason is the arc is plain and transparent for all to see and the future is scary for them.
The single idea about money is "confidence" and little else.  If enough people agree that something is hard cash it becomes exactly that. How is paper money in any way superior to digital currency? For one important thing, it is wittled away with inflation.  Banks and Government can interfere with it. Money is only money because we agree it is. In jail, cigarettes are money and have real value.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:06:58
I think that all this hype and mania is something that we will all have to eat if we want to transition through to mainstream.

 Go to both subreddits. When you do, go down the posts and award a mark to every original post that negatively comments on the other coin. If you do that simple task you will see a massive score for shit posts in r/btc over that of r/Bitcoin.  
I'm not saying it doesn't happen in r/Bitcoin, but in r/btc if they couldn't sledge btc they wouldn't have much to say about anything.

I agree... That both the Wall Street and the crypto markets collapsing within a few weeks of each other must have an association of some kind.  Tell me it's a coincidence, if you will, but I'm not buying it.
I wonder which one will get bailed out in the end?
Might it be the banks? 
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:52:35
You own 32 coins?
Great work man. A true believer. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 06:31:12
I hope I'm also in it for the technology cause I've ridden this bastard all the way down to the bottom.  
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:39:53
Kooks blunder in here all the time. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:12:39
It is something unpleasant that you sometimes step in. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:57:55
Nope, we have had a couple of those already . The run is on.

Ah, adoption is adoption. It is unattached from purpose.  If he adopted Bitcoin to keep under his pillow or adopted it to teach it to swim or adopted it to build a house with with it doesn't change the verb. You don't adopt children only to trade them away for other articles.
Or, maybe you do? I don't know you? 
@_date: 2018-02-14 01:32:37
True. I'm just glad it didn't hit 5k. I would have rode it down to that, but glad I didn't have to.
Funny the things that you are grateful for. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:21:30
Don't be a killjoy. It's been a rough couple of months for some. Let them enjoy the upturn for a while. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:55:17
Thank you. Your opinion is very important to us. Please hold on line two. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:53:29
Me too. Take advantage of the dips, they're Bitcoin sales. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:23:30
This is the most amazing strategy. He might take up juggling chainsaws, or something? 
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:25:42
I love the final line:
"It's just not worth the stress right now".
A  single day's involvement in crypto? 
I want to buy him a beer. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 06:57:02
Many apologies, Cuz! 
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:14:50
Hmmmm... Are YOU Roger Ver? 
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:27:57
Until tomorrow when they condemn it again.
Some help doesn't actually help.

Bwater forked from Water last August. Didn't you get your air drop? 
@_date: 2018-02-25 05:04:42
That's like saying that cars will never catch on because there isn't any gas stations yet.
It takes a bit of time. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:06:14
Yeah... The name of the ship is called the USS Fuddester.  It has sank and risen even higher about 20 times over the last 9 years.
Funny think is every single time some jerk predicts that Bitcoin will sink they are right.
 And every time that same jerk yells "bubble" and "tulips" when it recovers. Thus it ever was and ever will be. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:17:05
This is my experience. I felt the pain of Bitcoin dropping until it hit about 15k and then... pop... I just accepted it. No more concern or worry. I can't put my finger on it, but it was just pure calm. The fucking thing could drop to $200 and it wouldn't change anything for me. I guess it hit me that nothing about Bitcoin tech has changed a single bit. There are still an army of smart developers working in the background. The industry is ramping up and the vibe was positive. The only FUD was coming from mainstream media and the establishment which never liked or understood crypto anyway. For the first time I could read some economic analysis about something and realise that I knew more about the subject than the author. That is powerful stuff.
It is not faith anymore, but knowledge. I have no idea what the price will be in a week or six months from now. Strangely, I don't care. I know it's coming back strongly, and I don't want a fucking Lamborghini anyway.
@_date: 2018-02-25 04:59:15
I'm not going to even give a shit about any of this for about five years. This slow up, down and sideways action will rob you of your your sanity. The long term trend is upwards if you zoom out a bit. The day-to-day shit is simply a kick in the balls.
Don't look. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:51:08
Redditer for one week drops in to teach us the facts. *eye roll*. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:34:38
Not me. I'm like Superman and Blockfolio is a kryptonite sandwich. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 04:59:17
Yeah, obviously there are no bad guys operating outside of crypto and taking people's money. Manipulation only happens with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 06:20:44
To give them credit, they threw everything but the kitchen sink at  Bitcoin. 
I was just thinking that they must have a Plan B? 
@_date: 2018-02-14 03:04:37
I'm grateful for many things. That is one of them. I'm also grateful for your reminder. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:59:14
I hear your pain, but Bitcoin needs to be tested by arseholes. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 07:36:50
It is a good thing that you are going. You apparently were lowering the community gene pool. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:46:58
I think that the support line is 5k and thought that when it was still at 12k.
Still, that estimate is about as accurate as plucking a number from my butt. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:49:53
I've only just started to lose money (on paper). I think I'm down about 4k now, but not really. You only lose money if you sell. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 01:48:05
A crash or correction doesn't ask for permission nor is it bad or good within itself. If you leave the tap running in a bathtub unattended do you blame the tub,  the water or yourself?
People got burnt in the correction for a lot of reasons, but mostly for a lack of research, greed, stupidity, madness, FOMO or untimely bailing. 
I lost nothing because I still have what I invested. I neither made nor lost money. Ask me in five years. That's my time frame. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 08:52:09
I certainly did.  
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:19:09
I'm impressed, Lad. Well done!
