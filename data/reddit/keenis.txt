Bring your bitcoin businesses to Washington State. We've had a 3.9% GDP growth compared to country average of 1.2% mostly due to tech growth around Seattle.

I hope to see at least one of my personal friends get into bitcoin. I sent one friend 0.5 btc for christmas. Hes an accountant so im hoping he sees the magic

This is why i dont lock my trezor up. The recovery key is locked up. Just a bunch of words on a peice of paper written down mixed with other words but in a pattern i recognize
@_date: 2015-12-26 16:16:02
@_date: 2015-12-25 12:41:54
Trezor is easy to use. I keep the recovery key in a safe that is 24 hour water proof and 2 hour fire proof (400 degrees rated so electronics stay out of the safe.)

Doesn't this seem to make Bitcoins hard to use for the average joe who is just joining the BTC community? I just joined a month ago. Took my extra spending money and bought up to 0.9 BTC. I had it in my Havelock wallet with an authenticator and everything. I logged in last night to see it was all stolen. This is what makes me cautious about buying more BTC. If it's so much easier to steal that fiat currency without going through extensive secruity measures and making it much more difficult to spend than pulling out my Visa card that's a huge risk to the integrity of the system.

Not to sound ignorant but what is the great fear of this? I started using their Vault after keeping an offline paper wallet. Is this assuming Coinbase does a 'mount gox' and all the coins you have with them are gone?

I've had it active on my account for 2-3 months now. Works just fine and shows you your coinbase balance along with all your fiat balances. USAA has no issue with you buying and selling bitcoin through coinbase through their bank. I don't store many bitcoins at all on coinbase, thanks trezor, but it is useful to keep a small amount for my swift card, should I need it, or just sending too and from the coinbase wallet. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 16:18:41

Living in WA state we don't have Gemini either... I'm curious why our state is so tech savy but behind in bitcoin. I know we also have some of the cheapest electricity in the world and there is bitcoin mining around here. 
@_date: 2016-03-02 20:09:00
I started using kraken to buy. It has been a wonderful exchange except getting money from my US bank into their account has been hard

There are a few here who really hate taxes and will call you a pro government lacky if you disagree with them. Bitcoin can still be an amazing product while supporting taxes... Sure the government has mega issues at times, but having decent roads to drive on, decent public utilities, hospitals, schools, police and firemen... Being against these things is like yelling at Obama for social healthcare and then telling him not to touch your medicare edit:typos

I believe he uses hydroelectric power through the variois dams over rivers in Eastern Wa. Tons of power harnessed by form of moving water. Cheap material supply means cheap power. Hell, I Live in Everett WA like 4 hours away from the dams and my 1930's home is all electric
 I paid 0.09815 for each watt X by like 1.05KW.. it was lile $102 Came out to like $108 looks at it by states and you can see WA is on bottom

People here hate Coinbase because they really follow government regulations to a T, that and they can have questionable customer support. I've used Coinbase for 3 years and have never had an issue with them and generally have enjoyed the experience... they made getting into bitcoin really easy and it felt secure. I just buy and move it to my hardware wallet. With all that said, I've been using circle more just because of their 1% rate vs coinbase's 1.5%... although the base price seems higher on circle... All in all Coinbase or Circle are excellent exchanges for first time buyers.

Also, if you have a cell phone for games, some games pay out satoshi's just for playing, Alien Run is one of the smoother one that pays out a few cents in bitcoins when it cashes out  Literally paying out cents but it's fun to see 20,000 Satoshi's pop into your wallet for just dickin' around,

I think i really joined thebit coin game in early 2014. I would say my average coin purchase is about 290-380 dollars.. at 705 now. I dont know many investments i can double my money with potential for more growth over time, so i consider this spectacular growth. hell if i bought now and it went to 900 i would consider a 200 dollar for every 700 i invested amazing. Alt coins have been around longer than 2014. I feel like if someone buys 1000 coins now at 700 dollars there is still lots to be made
@_date: 2016-11-22 14:39:06
Yup, I still just buy the same dollar amount. Throw $100-$500 at it every so often
@_date: 2016-11-11 20:25:13
This seems so huge to me.

Why should we pay taxes? I love paying taxes. They make the roads in my city that i drive on nicer, pay for fire and police service, make it so people around me are educated through public schooling... I'm happy to pay my property, sales and income tax because it feeds the system I live in. Now there are a bunch of issues with how taxes are managed but that doesn't make them bad.
@_date: 2016-12-06 20:04:52
Continue to lose? It's been going the opposite way lately. Even if they add like a billion alt coins that have 0.1% market cap that add up and eat into overall market cap.

It would be so nice if there was a service that tracked bought and sold coins or ones used in transactions and gave you a tax paper at the end of the year to make it easy. Wish coinbase did

BTC_Forever is also a bit extreme anti government who thinks taxes are evil. Coinbase for sure has it's issues. They follow government banking regulations and money transfer laws which makes them legit but also has the pain of the red tape.

It's... probably true. How many people that buy and use bitcoins file capital gains or loses on their income taxes, it's not the easiest thing to do and I've filed my own taxes for over a decade.

I'm not so sure. Sometimes when scarce materials are pressured or banned it only drives up the price of the item because it doesn't stop people from wanting them. It doesn't make me want less Bitcoin it makes me want to get and hold as much as I can

I know this is a semi joke but it's also important to let your love ones know how to access your savings. My wife knows I'm into Bitcoin and knows we have money in Bitcoin. I've been fighting leukemia for 15 months with a relapse, death is a very likely outcome for me but I'm still fighting. I've made sure she knows how to get into Trezor and conduct Bitcoin transactions. Had her buy civ 6 on steam go give her experience.

USAA Bank allows you to view your Coinbase Bitcoin Wallet from your USAA home page. Sucks that they are active military/veteran and families but they are a very bitcoin friendly bank.
