Those are service issues that are inherent to the trade.  It's not bitcoins fault you got ripped off, they do that with any form of currency.  Same with the pimpslaps, they do that with money too.
Seriously, it's actually a really valid use case for bitcoin. :)

Yes there is!
Prostitution.   Prostitutes don't need to carry cash, so that is safer.  The accounts are "anonymous" enough that a prostitute can deny it is theirs no matter how hard their pimp beats them.  Johns can pay in advance, knowing there is a legitimate blockchain to record their payments, and thus they do not need to carry cash either.
Bitcoin, making prostitution better for everyone. :)

I'm not sure that you fully understand the nature of bitcoin.
You *do* realise that it is completely anonymous, right?  These guys could literally say "We lied, we saw a spike in traffic and tried to make ourselves look good by lying" and boom, they are off the hook.
Sure, go ahead and stand in court and say "Well, your honour, I can't actually prove they did it, or offer up any evidence that it was them, but they said on an internet website one time that they were super duper hackers!".
Good luck with that.

Well then, better call Bitcoin HQ and tell them to make a police report....  oh wait...   decentralised anonymous network...  right...

This is now my main source of bitcoin news :D

oh noes, someone called me a troll!
You are lying and trying to scam people.  Calling someone a troll because they found you out is not a response that inspires confidence.

Sure we will, once he cashes out his pre-mined coins.

In the video it shows exactly that.
The technology is the problem because using a service like localbitcoins, my location is not identified.  If it shows a map, as the video shows, then a potential mugger has my precise GPS location and knows I have at least X dollars on hand.

This guy is a scam.  He is not giving anything away, and the miners are not "spare".  They are affiliate referral rewards.  He does not have *anything* to "give" you.
He is spamming his affiliate link so that you can get a "free" miner on signup and he gets the commission.
Same as your other thread,

Why would that be a problem?  Buying bitcoins is not illegal.
They are legal to own and legal to use.  Just like money.  Cops don't bust you for getting £20 out of the bank, they bust you for buying drugs.  This app doesn't let people sell things, it lets them trade cash for bitcoins.
It's like an app for localbitcoins.

Holy shit.
Seriously, let me just highlight one glaring problem that jumped at me right out of the gate.
You are effectively providing a list of people in my area who have on them a cash value above a set amount.
Lets say I'm a criminal, and I want some money.  I open your app, tell it I want to trade a bitcoin for cash and it shows me a map of "people nearby with several hundred dollars cash on hand".  It's like an aimbot for muggers.

"bitch and moan".
Sure, you mean you started two threads and I pointed out that they were both scams and you were trying to lie to people?
Sure, bitching and moaning.
Hey, why don't you whine about your "losses" at paypal, or your imaginary fiance...  Go on, it gets funnier every time.

Never has there been a more relevent [xkcd](
@_date: 2014-12-08 17:19:00
Yes...  I had to read it twice tobe sure, but it appears he's pulled it off.  He's taking their chip inventory, putting them into miners and selling them back...   It's either financial genius or criminal mastermind, only time will tell us which.

Don't be an idiot.
You don't need to backdoor every single server.  You just put an intercept on the cable coming out of the building.

Still a better return than holding it ;)
