if he does that for an entire year, and assuming his only other asset is his twitter stock, it would be a 0.1% (10 basis points) allocation of his portfolio to Bitcoin... not exactly swinging for the fences.

‘Not for square’s commercial interests’
So, people being paid by the owners of a payments company will be spending their time working on open source competitor product. Seems pretty fucked up.

you realize these two statements are logically inconsistent, right? how do you plan to replace all media of exchange with something you won't exchange?

Buying currency isn’t an investment. You do it because you need to use it or you are speculating that the exchange rate will change and you can profit. It has no intrinsic value as an investment (cash flow). Bitcoin fails as a currency exactly because people won’t spend it. 
edit- my original point was a guy worth at least 1/2 billion buying $10,000 worth of something isn't news.

buying currency is not an investment, it is speculation (unless you need that currency for facilitating operations). Currency has no intrinsic value and there are no cash flows associated with holding the asset.

you can say that about literally anything. youth soccer leagues have have hidden goings on behind the scenes. making a blanket conspiracy claim only delegitimizes what you are saying even if it is true. you have to be more specific and provide evidence if you want to convince critically minded people. I wouldn’t be surprised at all if accusations against someone like Assange were politically motivated but I would need more than “it’s a deep state conspiracy” to make me believe it more than what reputable institutions are telling me.

Yeah that’s what I thought. Why is this not discussed?
