I agree, taxes are surely not the only way to redistribute wealth. I tried to suggest that by writing "decreasing" instead of "eliminating" but it could be read that way still I see now.  
Importantly, it seems like the popular assumption that wealth redistributes itself over the long term is being proven false, especially by the recent "Capital in the Twenty-First Century" by Piketty and team. Its not just another economics book apparently. Because of this, wealth concentration and power concentration are a big problem that wont just be solved by time. I just feel like there is the possibility that the potential anonymity of bitcoin and others could be another tool used to hide large amounts of wealth from governments. You can do this already really but if you want to participate in most forms of trade you need a bank account and governments have been getting good at auditing those.

I think so far there isnt enough scholarship to back up the claim that wealth redistributes it just fine. One of the reasons people are taking "Capital in the Twenty-First Century" so seriously is the rigorous methods the authors used to support their conclusions. The strongest appeal of the book and its ideas is how its not a book of concepts and ideas but a book of proofs and research. 
I agree that certain regulations can protect entrenched money but other regulations can be used to prevent the very same thing. I dont agree that regulations are inherently the problem. That seems overly simplistic.

Will this make mining less profitable and give some relief to the GPU market?

Will this affect the ROI from GPU,electricity costs/coin rewards possibly relieving the the GPU market finally?
