we need to make sure we are clear in our use of the word "punishment" and market punishment vs forceful punishment
when i said punishment i was referring to market punishment which may take the form of disassociation, like for example refusing to buy things at walmart because they don't pay their employees enough
when you said punishment i assume you are referring to forceful punishment like what the government employs and market supporters believe is only justifiable when another person is harmed
if we use clear and consistent definitions i am confident you won't find any contradictions or "patterns" as you claim to find

a market is not simply everyone doing whatever and getting away with whatever they want if they have money, other actors can react to someone doing something bad. so while there isn't a declaration and enforcement of "you can't pay people to lie!" from an authority figure (the authority figure's ability to make such a rule reality can be called into question too) in a market if its discovered that someone is in fact paying someone to tell lies then the other actors in the market can take measures to punish the bad behavior without using force, or if the offense is bad enough the other actors might find it worthwhile to pay for forceful punishment to be used

make sure you don't give the wrong impression about what bitcoin is by having something "sponsored by bitcoin" it would really give people the wrong idea about what bitcoin is

studying some economics might give you a better understanding of the problems bitcoin faces

we already established that it was not this particular sellling of bitcoins that caused this, it is more likely, though not guaranteed that it was something to do with silkroad or black markets in general

bitcoin is not exactly a perfect currency or as an ideal currency like gold/silver 
but it does have the advantage of being hard to confiscate like gold can and so on and both are better than government fiat currencies so if you can get precious metals go for it in terms of storing wealth
if many vendors you use switch to bitcoin then it may be easier to use bitcoin than gold
