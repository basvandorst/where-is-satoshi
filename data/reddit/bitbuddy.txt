Yeah well, i've seen at least 50 things here that would take Bitcoin to the moon but didn't. 
Let's wait and see if it gets accepted in the first place. 
Personally i don't see all the big investers and billionaires suddenly jumping in Bitcoin because of one new ETF. 
If they really wanted to the lack of one wouldn't have stopped them. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 00:12:03
How are we supposed to know exactly?
@_date: 2017-01-05 10:15:30
Bad news can happen. At any point. If you can't handle that then sell. Nobody knows where the price will go. Or if bad news will come or not. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 12:11:13
I truly can't stand these "cheap coins" posts anymore. You've had 8 goddamn years to buy cheap coins. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 22:43:12
As soon as the price goes up nobody cares about the poor in Venezuela anymore or whatever the pump of the day was. 
99% is in it to get rich. Let's face the facts. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:42:44


We agree. That's my whole point. Post after post here from people claiming it's a safe haven. Which is an insane thing to suggest. 
It bothers me that none of these people retract their words when we go down 25% in a day. They just ignore it
@_date: 2017-01-05 09:45:55
Yes. Someone sold lots of coins. What else?
Or did you think it can only go up?
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:19:51
Ah ok. That just solved everything! Great thinking!
@_date: 2017-01-06 21:50:48
Is there anything ever not good for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-01-06 23:44:19
Do you think we all have crystal balls here or what? These questions always amaze me. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 08:29:34


So why don't you use those?
@_date: 2017-01-06 12:33:14
Before the price rise: post after post how this time it was real. Built on fundamentals and not a Chinese pump and dump. Gentlemen prepare, mass adoption was gonna happen!
After the dump: this is totally normal guyz! Enjoy the cheap coinz! Rollercoaster weehee &lt;insert meme&gt;
@_date: 2017-01-06 12:35:53
Honest question. Does Bitcoin look like a safe haven to you? Does a safe haven crash 25% the day after you invest in it?
If yes then we have a different definition of a safe haven. 
And if you still think Bitcoin is something an indian with 2 dollars a day to spend should invest in then i think you're borderline insane. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 13:10:45
I like how you completely avoided my questions. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:54:35
Lots of hopium and "reasons". 
@_date: 2017-01-05 12:14:55
What exactly does the hacker delete?
@_date: 2017-01-06 13:24:33
Hey, don't worry you just lost 25% of your live savings in this safe haven! Just HODL! 
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:56:21
Man, do what you think is best. It could go up, it could go down. Anybody who says anything different is talking out of his ass. We could be at 1500 tomorrow or 500. It's all possible. 
I just noticed this is your 2nd thread with the same question. Are you gonna create another one? 
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:14:40
People buying hoping to make more money. Not exactly rocket science. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 12:38:41
And of course Bitcoin is the ooooonly thing that exists where they could store their money?
Either their local currency OR Bitcoin! No other options exist! 
@_date: 2017-01-05 22:49:12
Risk of getting scammed is too big. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:18:06


Yeah well, i stopped reading here. Let me know when you're back in reality. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 12:27:05
Oooh long term! So we tell them "HODL!"
Should i include some meme picture when doing that?
@_date: 2017-01-05 22:46:51
No. nobody is gonna take that risk. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 12:02:40
I have no problems with people selling some coins but whales using 1000 of coins trying to push the price down losing millions make my day. 
They try to make my coins worth less so i won't feel sorry for them. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:54:35
The volume on the Chinese exchanges is not real. It's probably a fraction of what you are actually seeing. 
Either way for some reason there the price keeps rusing and we just follow them. As soon as the buying there stops it most likely will stop here as well. Let's hope it continues :)
@_date: 2017-01-06 12:37:12
Sounds decent. I'll pass it on. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 11:52:13
This most likely has to do with the spam brigades and vote manipulation originating from this sub in the past. 
Lots of subs had lots of problems with Bitcoiners "spreading the word". 
@_date: 2017-01-04 23:54:06
Dude, don't be this naive. He has no idea where the price will go. Neither of us have. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:30:48
 China is hacked!
@_date: 2017-01-05 23:50:27
How are we supposed to know exactly?
@_date: 2017-01-06 09:06:37
I wonder how many more years we'll see these shitposts. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 12:41:59
It was fun the first 5 times. The 30 times after not so much anymore. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:52:39
I've seen several posts over the last days when we were over 1000 saying the same thing as we would never see sub 1000 prices again. 
Maybe we should stop giving bad advice all the time. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 21:52:49
Yet you aren't buying shit. You just want others to buy. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 03:25:52
This time it's different! Nothing but fundamentals and reasons and not just a Chinese pump and dump!
Right guys?
@_date: 2017-01-06 12:39:15
Please stop with this shit. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 12:09:13
And then it magically goes up again, right?
You've had 8 years to buy. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 12:40:29
In 15 years:
Cheap coinz guyz! Relax! Just HODL &lt;insert meme&gt;
@_date: 2017-01-05 07:30:36
Sorry but that is complete nonsense.
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:00:01
There isn't. When people here start saying that you know they have no trading or investment experience whatsoever. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:14:11
How blind are you?
@_date: 2017-01-05 12:19:03
Yeah but like what? I never touched OB, i have no idea what you are talking about. Why would anyone pay him the ransom? What do they get back?
@_date: 2017-01-06 08:11:36
This is all one big Chinese pump and dump. With the scary part being that we're following fake exchange numbers. 
The whole situation is completely crazy. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 12:23:52
Ouch. Downvoted immediately!
We simply ignore it then? Hey, just asking. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 07:29:50
Haha where? That would be absolutely crazy. I don't believe you. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 22:56:28
Doesn't matter. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 07:31:50
You must be a millionaire!
@_date: 2017-01-06 21:54:40
And what if we're lower in 3 months?
Will you come back and apologize for the shit advice?
No, of course not. None of you moon kids ever do. You just dissapear. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:18:56
Just weak hands!
@_date: 2017-01-06 12:14:50
Yeah well, too bad then. 10 years from now people also want cheap coins. And 20 years from now.
