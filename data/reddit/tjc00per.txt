Do they still charge you 10% for this?  I was going to post asking where can you buy without forking over your ID, which most sellers want on even localbitcoins.

What's a central bank vs regular bank?  I recall SVB spent like $100m on BTC around 2013

NP, tried you warn you all.   Nothing else I can do

You're all in for a rude awakening when you find out BTC was a Ponzi scheme to flood the stock market, like corporate stock repurchase with taxes, and oil.   
    
This is all going to collapse before 10/10 when hyperinflation kicks in from REPO injections.   All because ARAMCO lost the ability to subsidize the markets and America oil goes to the treasury.

Times running out to stay ahead of the curve.  It's coded because if it weren't everyone would do it and no ONE would be in control.  Eventualities, prepare for all you can imagine as plausible

Just wait.   You people think bitcoin is a savior, I did early on, but it only got this far because bankers us it to transfer liquidity between the markets that need it.   It popped up after the recession to keep it going a little longer but the REPO market is dead as long as Saudi Oil can't produce and they're using BTC to save their FIAT.

You all put fiat into an exchange (bank), which they convert to a product they have the majority control of.   They take that fiat and move it to another bank.   There's literally NOTHING preventing them from closing the exchanges and wiping $100+ billion from their ledger.
