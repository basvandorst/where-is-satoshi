I am convinced that the most effective way to do good by donating is to support Existential Risk prevention. Roughly, increasing humanity's chances to survive the coming century by even a tiny percentage will be more valuable long-term than any amount of suffering prevented today – even compared to the maximally efficient charity mitigating animal suffering. I have never seen anything refuting this argument.
I endorse [Miri]( because they deal with the highest existential risk and the most underfunded problem there is, have proven to produce high-value research, and have thus for shown to scale fairly well. I myself have donated to Miri several times before, and will continue to give as much money to them as I can, as long as it looks like they do the best work. Also int his field, the [Center for Human Compatible AI]( is a second option.
Alternatively, Climate Change and nuclear weapons pose another existential risk, though this is not my area of expertise. The [Future of Life Institute]( is a great organization focused on X-Risk in general. I think they would give personal advice, too.
For a more extensive argument why I believe AI is the thing to focus on, see 
As to why Miri, see 
I earnstly hope you will choose to attribute your givings in this direciton. Either way, I highly respect you for doing this at all.
