I am sorry that you had lost so much money, even though many had already probably said it to you, I will say it again cause it is worth remembering forever
"do not invest more than you can lose"
Ok now here is what i would do if I was you:
- What is the amount of money that you need today and cannot afford to lose ? if it's let's say 5000, then take it out, and keep the rest hoping that one day you will get your money back
- if you are in no dire need of the money, honestly HODL. I mean you only lose money if you withdraw it ?
So at the end of the day asses what you really need and cannot afford to lose, and take it out

You know what my friend, I do miss the days when it used to linger around 1k, at least I was able to buy a full bitcoin

Sorry but that is B.S . I am a software engineer and I know that good technology does not equal good investment or safe haven. Kozmo was ahead of it's time when it came out in the tech bubble, was the uber of today, but went bankrupt due to the high cost of GPS devices that they had to give out to users for the app to work
App was great, financially, not so much

No money in bank account.
and I mean I can still see the BTC in my wallet also.
As well as not recent activity of (Sell) in the dashboard
I do not think it went through

Agreed. Unless you are looking for some liquidity (if you are a trader for example), then I do not know what other options you have

Welp. Just looked in the transfer history and it shows as canceled (i never canceled it)
thats cool though. Since its back up now. But that's my worries with coinbase. I need a better system to sell/buy on
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:46:53
 just wanted to sell some and buy low. But with the speed of coinbase that is just not possible
I still have no idea if the sell went through or not, lol. But I am guessing not since I can still see my money in coinbase wallet. maybe that was just an automatic email sent

yeah. That "closed meeting" did not do a good drop yesterday. So they decided to ban. China is manipulating the marked. It's disgusting 
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:49:42
Lol glad I am not the only one .
Not much you can say though. Or you will be attacked by hodlers
I will leave you with this

I have a secret for you. You are not the only one doing that, most as well are. If everyone holds it for mass adoption, then you are holding it for no real value other than holding it. And if you look around the sub, you will know that a big percentage are doing what you are doing. What do you think this sudden growth occurred because  ? Is bitcoin suddenly being used more as a currency ? nay. It is because the bandwagon to the "moon" is fun. So I do not know what is your definition of mass adoption, and if it is for using bitcoin more as a currency, than I do not see any sign that we are remotely close to that.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:44:42
tl;dr: The biggest driving force for buying bitcoin today, is to hodl for future mass adoption. That, is a problem
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:42:03
It is funny because I was discussing this with my friend today
Unfortunately many of bitcoin "hodlers" today do it to make money, and not to utilize it as a currency. So the real value of bitcoin to some, is it's increase in value, and that my friends, is not a value, and is very well the definition of a bubble
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:17:15
Let's be honest, there is no trick. You just get lucky sometimes, lol
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:48:43
What is the right way to preform such transaction ? Will smart contracts solve that problem ?
@_date: 2017-07-23 16:01:20
Oh and this

Things could still go wrong technically with the hard fork.
Japan will suspend payments during the hard fork
Coinbase and other online platforms will not allow you to withdraw for 4 hours. Even though they said you will not lose your money, some poeple might still freak out and sell
