Sorry, not here to feed a disrespectful, ignorant and rude troll. Have a good one!

Your ignorance is rather arrogant. But I suppose, people does include all people... even the likes of you.

Tell that to Nikola Tesla or other free energy enthusiasts �� Ideas and food are the blood of the society, that still needs a legitimate currency that is liberating.

Internet is required for many things, the technology should be universally available and liberating. However, not everyone understands or has the capacity to understand it, doesn't mean they don't deserve liberation and educating. Sometimes even mere awareness isn't resourceful enough.
I ran a node for about an year in a third world country, being involved in a NGO serving the poorest of the poor. These people didn't understand anything about the internet (or had access to it), let alone Bitcoin. Their minimalistic investment of $10 to $50 was multiplied over time. They told me that I was their "Messiah", I told them that I am only doing my part, but wish others did too, cheers.

That's not the point though, the ethos behind Bitcoin is the key to mass awareness and adoption. Calling it currency of the internet doesn't do it justice, even sounds dubious to many people.

• Then why is it controlled?
• Why isn't it available to everyone?
• Why do we have to pay for it?
P.S. Not everyone happens to live in a so called first world country.

Thanks for the tip ��

If it wasn't for your username, ha! Nice troll though mate.

Good point, but alas not realistic... so gotta agree and disagree. National currencies and global economic variants are indeed scandalous. But, so is bartering, which lead to creation of money in the first place.
However, a true universal currency, such as Bitcoin is the requirement of the society, which can be realised if people vividly get behind the idea. Current currencies only feed the wealthy - the term itself relating to a certain currency.
The Warren's of the world who are piling billions of dollars foreseeing a recession are opportunists. A labour working much harder, void of opportunities, is still making less than $5 a day and won't have that either. Equality can only be achieved by a true global currency.

Going off track now, so not sure if there's a point debating further �� Blood is not a currency, neither it has to be. Even it flows without bias, equally throughout a living organism for sustenance.

Of the people, by the people, for the people ��

If that was meant for me, sure... happy to meet fellow crypto enthusiasts, send me a DM. Oh wait, I am a bot though ��

Absolutely, alas it is still barely accepted here. Bitcoin and blockchain are spectacular tech... it's a shame that people only focus on its FIAT price variations and not the liberation or utility.

Well said, agreed. Always doing my "bit" ��

We need more of these to facilitate mass adoption. There is a clear market for legitimate crypto promotion and education. Awesome vid ��
