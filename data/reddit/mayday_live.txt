 Quote from google 
"The mixin count refers to the number of other signatures (aside from yours) in the ring signature that authorizes the transaction. A default mixin of 4 means that there are 5 total signatures. Someone looking at a transaction with a mixin of 4 has no way of knowing which of the five signers is the true sender (source).
"Mixin" as a term used in Monero is different than how the term may be used for Bitcoin or DASH mixing services. In Monero, new transactions "mix" with other previous transactions in the blockchain in the way the protocol itself dictates. In other services, you "mix" your coins with other users' coins to make one transaction with many inputs and outputs. The verb used here is the same, but they are referring to two very different things.
To try and reduce confusion, some community members have advocated changing the name "mixin" to something that will differentiate it from traditional mixing services. You can see some discussions here on StackExchange, on Reddit, and on the Monero forum.
A higher mixin number will typically provide more privacy than a lower mixin number because it will provide a greater amount of plausible deniability. However, reusing an odd, recognizable mixin for your transactions will make your transactions stand out. To see more about what mixins provide the greatest level of privacy, see this post.
The GUI allows users to select a mixin between 4 and 25. The CLI allows users to select any value permitted by the network."
