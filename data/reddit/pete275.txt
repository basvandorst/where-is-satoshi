I don't understand which side he's arguing for, the drop from yesterday was obviously caused by the weird derivatives they were trading in the stock market, it's too much of a coincidence that it went down so much the same day the price mattered for them, and it immediately went back to normal after 4pm. If you love the stock market so much go back to trading stocks, GTFO with your "futures" and all that crap

Sounds fake, but in any case, I hear that these hardware wallets have a "decoy wallet" built into them that appears when you get the last word wrong. If someone gets into it (like a tax agency), they only see that wallet, where you conveniently keep a low amount of funds (like 1500 usd, which at the time of setting up could have been 200), and the "real" wallets is where the actual money is, but to access it you'll need the real final word, which might be written down somewhere else or maybe nowhere. $1500 is not enough to justify a hw wallet inside a safe, I bet there's a hidden final word somewhere

That's because transactions have to spend all their input, and generate outputs with the change . So if you're sending 0.1 btc but you have to spend an output of 1 btc, it'll show up as 1 btc spent in the block. There's no way to know how much is actually being transferred from looking at a block

I think a clear effect was that the system has a big vulnerability. Some random assholes announced a fork and suddenly all the exchanges are down and the network is halted for days out of fear.

ok but storing value and transferring value are 2 different things. bitcoin is great at storing value and it sucks at transferring it, so use Litecoin to pay for your coffee and use bitcoin to, you know, have some bitcoin and lookup its worth periodically and feel good about it. right now bitcoin is not ideal for everything, it's better for some things and really really really bad for some others

The guy who wrote this article obviously doesn't like like government of Venezuela, but I think he confused the private pre-sale with the public blockchain. The private presale is private, you can't verify how much it sold because it's not yet committed to a public blockchain, the government claims it happened and presumably they have bunch of private contracts made with their private investors, so you can't verify their claims. That doesn't mean you should automatically believe everything the government says, but you can't claim it's not true by looking at some public website, you need access to the information from the private presale for that

Exchanges have a lot of unspent outputs from users who deposit to their account. Those outputs don't belong to the user that created them tho, they are used to transfer out to users that request a withdraw, and the leftover (from the balance of deposits minus withdraws) is sent to a cold storage wallet. So it makes perfect sense that they have a lot of small inputs consolidated into one big wallet every few days, in fact it could mean the opposite to what OP suggests, a lot of people are depositing btc to the exchanges to get ready to sell, so much that the exchanges had to send 400mm worth to cold storage in a few days

20% is too low for some exchanges, bitfinex and poloniex were taking around 10usd for the transaction fee, it should be under 1 usd (or free, like bitstamp). For them it's not a technical problem, the withdraw fee was part of their income, they don't want to give that up

There'll still be less outputs because a normal wallet will create at leas 2 outputs per transfer of balance (one for the recipient, one for the change) and a batching system will create at most 1 output per recipient + 1 output for the change of the total batch (so if there's 500 recipients in the batch, it's 501 outputs).

If the only thing that differentiates the blocks is the size, that means the transactions will be susceptible to the double chain spend attack (I don't remember the correct name). They need to put a bit in the bch transaction that makes it invalid in btc (or vise versa), with that, they can make blocks &lt; 1mb in bch, as long as it contains valid bch transactions. Hopefully they did that, otherwise everyone trying to spend their BCH right away will also be losing their BTC

ah I see.. I assumed the transaction fees would be computed as an extra output on each transaction, since those aren't really "minted", they come from coins that already exist.. I guess not.. edit: maybe because the transaction is signed, so the miner can't add an extra output, now I get it..

That's great, but if you like big numbers you should look up the price in Argentinean pesos, it's almost 50k!

what's the point of that tho? those hashes don't do anything, and the speed and size of the blocks are still the same

I bet they rape you with the exchange rate, and they keep a copy of your ID, a retina scan, and a sample of the bacterial composition of your colon in their servers forever.

whitepaper is too long, I like it when it's just 1 page with graphics and maps, and it mentions my name a bunch of times
