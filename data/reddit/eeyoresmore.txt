And you don't need a bank to use cash.
@_date: 2014-11-28 04:19:08
Hey not sure if you can answer this or not, but since you're answering things on here thought I'd give it a shot. 
A few months ago Chase shut down the bank account I was using on Coinbase due to "high risk" bitcoin transactions. Because I had a pending purchase with Coinbase at the time I was immediately put on your black list. It seems like this is something that has occurred with quite a few people now, so I was just wondering if there's any way for people like me to ever purchase coins from you guys again, or if you guys are OK with losing out on customers due to those circumstances. I thought the whole reason of giving you all my identification information and credit card information was so that this could be avoided.
Outside of that, I love your company and would love to start giving you my money again. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 00:46:58
There's a lot of things you can't do with cash.
@_date: 2014-11-28 04:26:43
Ha, I know that NOW. I tried both a BOA and Capital One account after that and was basically told too late, too bad. It just seems blatantly obvious from my stand point that I'm not a security risk, I was just hoping there was something I could do to convince you guys of that.
@_date: 2014-11-28 04:35:27
Well both now. But Coinbase told me I was out of luck.
@_date: 2014-11-25 20:50:59
Why didn't anyone tell me that all my bitcoins were hacked?!
@_date: 2014-11-09 22:46:48
There are many ways in which bitcoin is better than cash and banks. But that doesn't mean it is better in every way. 
@_date: 2014-08-23 17:38:27
I've bought roughly 50 BTC from Coinbase since they've opened. My bank account was shut down because the bank deemed the Coinbase transactions as "high risk". Now even with a new bank account, Coinbase refuses to sell me any more coins because they view me as "high risk" as well. So basically, Coinbase is the reason that Coinbase thinks I'm high risk. Awesome.

Sorry, this is just by far the most asked question when taxation is discussed, and it's easier than typing out an essay. [Start here if ya want.]( 


That's literally what we have right now
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:16:03
Poor people are already paying for schools and roads. In a volantaryist society both would be much cheaper and there would be plenty of private charities to help the people who couldn't afford even the lowest level of education. Most importantly they'd actually have a choice of where to spend their money.
Would it be a perfect utopia where everything was completely fair? No. But it would be a hell of a lot better than what we have today.
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:24:12
Haha, touché.
@_date: 2017-08-26 23:21:04
The fact that you're questioning issues you've already received answers on, and resources provided for, tells me you're not actually interested in furthering your knowledge, but are arguing for the sake of argument. If you're actually curious and would like to learn more, then read the resources provided. If you need more, I'll provide more. Otherwise I'm not going to waste my time responding to someone who is just going to keeping throwing out random hypotheticals instead of actually having a discussion.
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:44:36


You're literally describing everything government touches
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:35:16
Why do you blindly assume that? You realize all the major international conflicts the U.S. have ever been involved with has been trough our own volition right? Take a look around the world at countries with tiny militaries compared to ours. Do you see super powers taking them over?
The greatest instrument for peace the world has ever seen is international trade. People don't bomb countries they trade with.
And why assume private militias wouldn't form if we were attacked? You are so completely set on this idea that if the government does something currently, than it could never be replicated in the market place. Except history tells us that is completely wrong. 
You're attitude of "if I can't personally imagine it being possible, than it must not be" is quite elementary. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:41:07


No shit, I'm just responding to the issues you question.


Like I said, it depends where you live. The concept of only paying if you drive is a good one. But through government waste, you are paying a lot more than you otherwise would if the roads were private.
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:25:45
Schools are mostly paid for through property taxes. Most poor people rent. Property tax is built into rent. If there was no property tax, poor people would pay less in rent.
Funding for roads vary a lot, but many are paid through gas tax and tolls. So if you're driving, you're already paying for them. These aren't taxes you can avoid or get a refund on.
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:39:19
I haven't downvoted you yet, but keep crying.
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:22:28
If you're actually interested in answers to your concerns:
@_date: 2017-08-26 13:56:28
The people who would like to utilize them, just like any other product or service. Private schools and roads already exist.

If you don't think David Friedman is credible, than you're not going to think anyone is credible. Read his book if you actually want all your questions answered.

After taking a look at some of the subs you mod, I'm not sure you have the best judgement of what classy is.
@_date: 2017-08-26 15:46:14
I don't disagree with that at all. We probably just disagree on which would be more evil.
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:29:11
I don't understand the argument. Should we never strive for new things simply because they don't exist? Should I abandon my morals just because I'm part of a minority?
@_date: 2015-08-21 06:04:19
Yep, had the same exact thing happen to me. I am also an MSB, and have had both Circle and Coinbase show me the door. I think both companies are taking a super conservative approach right now.

Just discovered it and it seems pretty cool. Be sure to vote for the addition of the Bitcoin community!

I live in Chicago. Is there an option to pick up in person?
@_date: 2015-02-12 15:02:32
Huh, little surprised the buy price is that generous.
@_date: 2015-02-12 12:21:41
They're selling at 8% over bitstamp, which is the number most people are looking for. I sell for 5% over bitstamp. That makes my sell prices cheaper than theirs.


That's not what that means at all. Their buy price is roughly at market value and their sell price is 8% over. Why would you assume market value is halfway between their spread?
Also, most ATMs don't purchase coins, so I have no idea why you would use their buy price to compare it to other ATMs.
@_date: 2015-02-12 00:04:57
Nope, that guy charges a lot more than me. I trade at my office.
@_date: 2015-02-11 22:14:00
Looks like they're charging about 8%. I sell 2 blocks away from here for 5% over if anyone who is looking to buy wants a better deal.
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:36:45
Ha, I was getting panicked over 10 BTC, 50 would have freaked me out. Good to hear it it's their now. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 01:33:08
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:14:14
Is this a rhetorical question or are you actually asking how they made that decision?
@_date: 2013-05-29 14:37:43
I don't vote and yet I still complain. Guess he was wrong. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 18:58:32
Still running incredibly slow. Hopefully this isn't a sign that they can't handle high volumes. 
Edit: And it's offline again.  
@_date: 2013-05-25 19:23:50
So you're OK with North Korea's current regime because the people of the country have not sufficiently proven that they would be better off with less violence?
@_date: 2013-04-27 08:06:54
It was in 1999.
@_date: 2013-03-02 23:31:32
Absolutely. Both good ideas and I have no doubt that creative solutions like these will eventually be implemented. However, I will not feel comfortable recommending bitcoins to certain people until that happens.  
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:07:17
Looks like you can still go in to your account and withdraw BTC from them. It's the USD in the account I'd be more worried about. 
@_date: 2013-03-02 23:04:16
That kind of responsibility will definitely scare people off though. 
@_date: 2013-05-26 04:06:42
No, but it's desirable to make sure you are using similar definitions of words during discussions. This seems like the best way to do it. 
@_date: 2013-03-15 18:46:48
It's about exposure, not actually making them wealthier.
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:09:01
Lol, do you have any rebuttals against the *actual* arguments he makes?


Um, that's the point. Markets being more accurate is a good thing. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:06:20
My second transfer out took about that long to show up. Obviously there's a massive back up. I'd say give it a little longer before getting concerned. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:02:22
Looks like it's just taking a while. Mine showed up on the blockchain after about an hour and a half. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:14:05


It's relevant to your insider trading comment. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:19:17
I sent money to bitfloor via a CapitalOne 360 P2P transfer 3 days ago and it still shows my deposit as "Pending". Is it normal to take this long?
@_date: 2013-04-20 16:45:19
CampBX if you get your account verified. Use this link to get 10% lifetime discount on commissions. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 15:17:32
It's still not any more valid to any specific person though. I get the argument; I just believe people use it in order to convince themselves their vote has some sort of meaning and makes some sort of difference. It does not. 
@_date: 2013-05-22 19:30:40
Because bitcoins are divisible, you can buy any amount of bitcoin you want. Only have $5? Buy $5 worth of bitcoin. It is most definitely NOT just for the rich. 
Edited for clarification.
@_date: 2013-04-20 01:54:42
Bitcoin is alright, I guess. If you're into that sort of thing. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 20:30:53
Yes, I would definitely recommend this. If you want you can use this link to get a 10% lifetime discount on all your commissions. 
 
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:52:54
That's what I'll be doing. Bitfloor was by far the easiest to deposit USD with though thanks to the CapitalOne P2P option. 
@_date: 2013-05-25 19:26:35
And that's great that different people use different definitions, but to make things easy, I tend to stick with the most widely accepted uses. Ones found in dictionaries.
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:30:45
Well I'm not saying anything, I was just asking a question. But since you asked, yes I do think it's OK in certain instances. And as the owner of the exchange, he had every right to. 
@_date: 2013-05-25 17:00:50
Shouldn't the burden of proof be on those who claim violence to be morally superior? Also, as history has shown, it is freedom that lifts people out of poverty, not governments.
@_date: 2013-05-22 19:41:08
No problem. Welcome aboard!
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:51:42
But aren't I special?
Yea, totally missed that, thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-20 17:00:04
Yea, Roman confirmed this is exactly what happened. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:34:38
I picked a bad time to start trading with them. Have about 10 bitcoins locked up with them. Tried to transfer 5 of them out about an hour ago, but it hasn't showed on the blockchain yet. 
Edit: Just showed up on the blockchain, and I just transferred the second 5 to my personal wallet. Looks like I'll be just fine. Hopefully it works out for those with USD in their accounts. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:50:43
You have to understand why they did it like that though. If you tell everyone, then they all start buying and the price spikes, and then everyone is yelling at them for having to buy way above market value. 
@_date: 2013-05-25 14:26:22


So you advocate for violent systems over a voluntary society based on a hunch?
@_date: 2013-04-18 00:49:41
The owner of the exchange decides. Because he owns it. He's allowed to give information on the exchange to anyone he wants. It's his. Is something not clear about that?
If you don't trust exchanges, then don't use them. Over time the bad exchanges will go out of business (as we just saw) and the good ones will grow. If you don't understand the difference between fiat money and bitcoin, I'm not going to waste my time right now explaining it to you. 
@_date: 2013-05-10 21:21:12
The one correct thing he said:
"Is this the way of the future?"
"...Inevitably, yes."
@_date: 2013-03-15 18:54:42
Right now the bot has value because of the exposure it is giving bitcoin. The actual use of the money is still secondary. Also, people don't value karma less because it's "free". I guarantee no-one is going to start thinking money is worthless because they were tipped on Reddit.
@_date: 2013-05-29 15:59:38


How? Show me an instance in which one vote makes a difference. 


No, I'm not. I'm using statistics.


Why? If your vote doesn't make any difference, then why waste your time?


I'm just focusing on your voting comments right now.
@_date: 2013-05-29 14:51:05
Valid to whom? What difference would it make?
@_date: 2013-05-29 16:01:42


This is contradictory. If one vote doesn't matter, than one individuals vote *was* useless. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 15:49:30


But your individual vote is absolutely meaningless and thus it makes no sense to vote. You are more likely to die on the way to the voting booth than having your vote actually make a difference.
