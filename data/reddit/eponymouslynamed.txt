Insane market cap with no standard backing? No.
I’m not a hater, I understand the market, but this is a hot potato. You just don’t want to be the one holding it when it explodes.

‘Salty little boy’ wins debate against clueless fucktard. USD is backed by gold. BTC is backed by hopes and dreams.

Where did I say US currency doesn’t crash?
It’s backed by gold. I didn’t need to read shit, my economics degree, chartered accountant status, and financial adviser employer was more than enough.
Fiat currencies are a short step from commodity trading. Crypto currencies are backed by nothing but investor activity.
Get the fuck out of here with your nonsense, a 35% crash in a day is indicative of the volatility in a purely speculative market.
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:01:40
Lol you’ve completely misunderstood the argument and you post here thinking you’re right.
You’re arguing that currencies aren’t matched unit for unit with gold. Good for you, that’s right.
The point is, that’s not the fact I’m giving you, which is that in a fiat market the currencies still have residual value in gold, approx 5%, a mechanism that prevents the value crashing to zero, something BTC doesn’t have.
The volatility currently on display is indeed evidence of this instability.
Evidence of the degrees has been posted to my profile, so you can sod off with your incoherent, amateur nonsense - you smugly write as if you’re correct when you don’t know a damn thing.
When you attack a certified expert in the field with your overnight ‘knowledge’ of how currencies work, expect to be shut down hard. No lies or butthurt here, I’m just amused that someone with your level of understanding can be so adamant and yet so wrong.

Indirectly, it is still backed by gold.
Directly, GDP, foreign currencies, money markets, business markets.
But ultimately, gold.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:10:55
I wonder how a cryptocurrency can sink so low when it has no residual value. Hmmmmmmmm I wonder???? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:51:52
Lol, I did place a bet, as I said. I shorted bitcoin before the crash. Such a dumb cunt.
I never said it wouldn’t recover. I said it’s volatile because it’s backed by nothing but speculation. Moron.

Sure thing, I’m the one in the dark! I’ll look forward to digging this message out in a couple of years
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:46:38
Never said it was. You can print all the money you want and dilute the per-unit value, that doesn’t change a damn thing about the fact that its underlying security lies in a tangible asset.
How you can possibly argue that I’m the one who doesn’t know what they’re talking about is beyond me
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:10:29
So if there was a devaluation of a particular currency there wouldn’t be a run on gold?
Lol, this is bullshit investing. I’m glad to have my BTC holding but if you can’t see the end game, you’re fucked
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:15:00
Lol, 5% of the total USD market is directly matched with gold reserves. Yeah, I haven’t a clue.
Woo, bold text, guess that means I claimed a direct correlation between my argument and short term currency fluctuations?
No, I just claimed that they were more susceptible to fluctuations because they’re not backed by a tangible asset. I’m right, like the rest of the economists, move the fuck on.
Too many people think they’ve become an expert by riding this temporary wave.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:04:09
You’re hilarious. And a massive waste of time. The very fact that you try to claim my degree is false is enough for me to know how full of shit you are. The first link I provided was about USD, not the hypothetical principles of fiat. About 5% of US currency is specifically backed by gold. And your denial of that makes you fucking retarded.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:23:09
You are clearly the master, I’m out of my depth
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:38:15
‘Redeemable’ and ‘notionally backed by’ are two completely different concepts!
You’ve picked out a paragraph from my link that is completely debunked by the same article you’re referencing.
I sure hope BTC doesn’t crash to zero, the same way it’s IMPOSSIBLE for USD to do so while gold holds any value.
Have a nice life!
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:04:25
Not that I have anything to prove to someone this stupid, but I just put a photo of my degrees on my profile. ‘Quite obvious’ they’re made up, like it’s ‘quite obvious’ I know nothing about economics.
I didn’t have to google a thing. You’re pathetic, you tried to call me out, and you’ve been shut down. Making a small amount of money on a modern day gold rush does not make you an expert.
Block me and walk away, the classic ‘I’ve lost this argument’ response. USD is a commodity backed currency. I’ve explained how to you, and you keep sending me links that say it’s ‘largely’ fiat. I clearly can’t explain this shit to amateurs.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:21:43
Wrong. US currency is backed by gold.
It might only be about 5% of the currency in circulation, but that stabilises a mature currency.
No salty bitch tears, I was smart enough to invest at $4k and short at $19k. I just like rubbing salt in the wound because you were confident, smug, and completely wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:46:17
Uh, yes I did. I shorted at $19k. I said I was going to before it happened. And I bought the dip.
Oh wait, no I didn’t, because you said so. Ok pal. Looking forward to a reminder of my obvious stupidity.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:23:58
Yeah, you’re still wrong. It’s not my job to educate you, but when your argument is bullshit and you question my degree, you can fuck off.
5% of all US currency is directly backed by gold. The other 95% is accounted for by currency not in physical circulation, inflationary pressures, and speculative trading. Compared to bitcoin, which is 100% speculative trading.
You’re completely fucking wrong, and you’re so cocksure. Get yourself an education and stop playing with markets you don’t understand.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:42:39
Yuh-huh, I had no idea what I was talking about. I’m so naive
The value is all speculative. Or else it wouldn’t suffer the volatility seen today.
Please don’t talk about things you ‘don’t have much clue about’. Patronising prick.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:06:54
Speculation-driven. It has no underlying value. It’s going up in value because that’s what people are prepared to pay, that’s it!
I think it will boom again when it goes mass-market. It may go to 5-10x current value. But it’s a smokescreen, a Ponzi scheme, the rug is going to be pulled sharply from underneath somebody.
That being said, there have been a lot of winners, and there will be many more
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:43:39
It’s backed by no value. That’s not my opinion, that’s a fact. You’re just being stupid if you can’t see that! The same way people are stupid if they can’t see that 2+2=4.
The value is all implied. It’s backed by nothing. End of. Currencies are backed by gold. Bitcoin’s value is in speculative resale. It will crash.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:05:00
About 5% of the total value of US currency is directly backed and matched by gold reserves. That gives it a residual value, stability and investor confidence. To say that it is not backed by gold is completely false.
Bitcoin is not backed by any tangible asset, to any degree. It’s value is purely speculative.
You have told me I’m wrong, you have questioned my degree (and my age), and told me to ‘go read a book’.
Your tone is out of line. I am right, completely and irrefutably so, and I don’t care how sad it looks that I came back to demonstrate this after the inevitable dip in BTC value.

In the time it took you to reply, ETH started climbing again. You can’t take a one minute snapshot and call it a trend
You don’t have to zoom out far to see that it’s not falling right now.

Go on then, wreck me. Put some actual arguments in your text. It’s a genuine degree, obtained in 2007, so no, I’m not 15.
‘Wrong assumptions’ ������, BTC has gone to the exact level I said it would. 70% is a crash, you don’t need quotation marks.
You know fuck all and yet pose like an expert, it’s really funny.
Your entire argument has basically been ‘you’re wrong, you’re stupid’. When things play out exactly as I said they would, you double down despite putting your ignorance on full display.
which one would you like to be posted to? Your choice

Fiat value is incremental to physical value, not a total replacement. Or else coins wouldn’t be made from precious metals. You don’t know shit.
Accuse me of googling for research, then link to Wikipedia, not realising that the Wikipedia page for fiat currency supports my argument. Good work.

In September 1987 under the Reagan administration the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury James Baker made a proposal through the International Monetary Fund to use a commodity basket (which included gold)
Yeaaaaaaaaah, I don’t understand the basics and my degree is false. Retard.
