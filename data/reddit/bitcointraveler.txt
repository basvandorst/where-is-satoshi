I absolutely agree. One reason why running the default settings you will only get a relay node (no wallet). 1-cmd-docker generally nice to have but security is very important and requires additional steps.
The main reason I did this was so I can quickly test my environment against automated nightly builds of bitcoin core [master]( and segwit.
Later I added support for the release versions. It's an automated build on Docker Hub, verifies on build against GPG key and the source is always available. Thus the Dockerfile can be easily forked and build yourself if you upgrade once every couple months.
    mkdir docker-bitcoind
    cd docker-bitcoind
    wget 
    # manually check 20 lines of sourcecode
    docker build -t l/bitcoind .
    docker run -d \
      --name bitcoind \
      -v $PWD/bitcoind-data:/root/.bitcoin \
      -p 8333:8333 \
      l/bitcoind
    docker logs bitcoind

I have been spending almost half of my Bitcoins in the last 12 months and every time I am able to do so in a new place anywhere in the world it makes me happy. 
While proof-of-work/mining is the mathematically most fair coin distribution method I can think of, I want to increase the distribution of bitcoins even further manually by paying new bitcoin merchants and rewarding their initiative to offer their products/services in this amazing currency.

WhatsApp recently introduced e2e encryption. For verification, they show you a QR code and then a matrix of 4 * 3 groups of 5 numbers: 
At first I thought, well if you use base10 instead of base58/32 you have to type much more. But then I think they had many compelling reasons (mostly i18n, see the link). They encode ~ 200 bits of information in that matrix 10^60 / log(2). 
We need for segwit (256), version (4), other (8), checksum(~32) = 300 bits
So we would need pretty much 90 base10 digits. yes that sounds a lot at first. But its "only" 3 times longer 
usually we don't type addresses (scan QR-code). And with a good input form this would make it even easier.
With base58 you have to account for upper/lower case. And if you ever tried to tell someone your address via phone...
    def to_spoken(s):
      if s in "0123456789":
        return s
      return 'upper' + s if s == s.upper() else 'lower ' +s
    
    print(', '.join(map(to_spoken, "1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa")))
Comparing visual:
    1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa

Another idea could be to make every 10th number a checksum, so you will get feedback as you type and if you make a mistake you will realize it earlier.

Maybe 'forced' is a bit too strong here. On bitcoin pizza day I went around and asked businesses if I could pay for a pizza in bitcoin. Explaining the huge benefits of using a decentralized currency to someone isn't always easy given most peoples technical background. But of all the people I met on my journey so far, once they understood the mind-blowing difference between bitcoin and say paypal, most of them started to become very very interested in the concept.
German is my mother's tongue and Turkish theirs so the language barrier makes it even harder. An ELI5 Bitcoin in simple English is almost impossible, you will need advanced vocabulary.
So when we went on our next dive, Turgay suggested he could help with translating Bitcoin in plain Turkish. Once the pizza owner understood why using Bitcoin might be beneficial to him, he installed a bitcoin wallet on his smartphone and like so many others was surprised by the speed of a bitcoin transaction. He even wanted to be enlisted on coinmap.org and asked for a bitcoin accepted sticker.

The easiest was Hungary. Budapest has many people interested in Bitcoin, Hostel accepting Bitcoin and Restaurants. The community is welcoming and helpful. 
Also Turkey after I convinced the owner of a travel agency to accept bitcoin for the stay and all the activities (rafting, SCUBA diving, bungee jumping)

So the first step was to look at coinmap.org to find bitcoin friendly places. It's still small but it increased from 5000 to almost 7500 in my year. (Almost 7 new places per day!)
Another way I used a lot was: I meet new people, talked them about bitcoin. Many of them were fascinated and if they were interested I would let them pay for lunch in fiat and pay them back in Bitcoin. That way they get their first few coins and see how it works without risking much.
I tried to convince the merchant to sign up with a bitcoin exchange, bitpay or coinbase, which worked a few times, especially If I stayed some time.
If none of the above was possible, I used fiat which I got via trading Bitcoin with the locals.

The numbers show the amount of data pushed to the stack. 
For example  a 1of3 raw multisig operation it would be:
    OP_1 33 33 33 OP_3 OP_CHECKMULTISIG
The "new" (since 2012 or so) *compressed* pubkeys are exactly 33 bytes long (0x02/0x04 + 32 bytes x coordinate)
Some people still used older 65 bytes uncompressed pubkeys in their script. This allows already 2^2 =4 variations for this single 1of2 multisig case:
    OP_1 33 33 OP_2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG
    OP_1 33 65 OP_2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG
    OP_1 65 33 OP_2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG
    OP_1 65 65 OP_2 OP_CHECKMULTISIG
Another reason is some protocols (mastercoin/counterparty,...) wanted to store "data" in the blockchain before nulldata outputs were promoted to IsStandard() . (OP_RETURN + up to 80 bytes)
There were no validity checks for the data pushed being a valid pubkey. So they can store random data in a 1of2 multisig while still being able to spend the output later.
Please note that todays recommendation is to use P2SH when using any multisig operations. This will help keep the UTXO set smaller.

I only remember a single trader who wanted to wait for 1 confirmation transaction (about $100 worth). All merchants accepted zero-confirmation. Most used bitpay, coinbase or a small local startup providing the same service. Some used SPV wallet on their phone. 
I don't think people are likely to try and double-spend small amounts if you buy coffee or pizza face to face. If you can "run away" easy, hide your ID online it might be a bigger issue.
But then, I don't think most merchants know what a double-spend even is.

1. The goal was to spend less than 80 bitcoins (Jan 2015 value). Also I hoped to find work in Bitcoin. So I can spend as I gain. But getting people to pay you in Bitcoin is even harder :/
2. Bitcoin is the first digital asset with proven scarcity. I want to emphasize it's limited to 21 million.
3. I used all online resources to find out Hostels, Restaurants accepting Bitcoin. Are there Bitcoin ATMs at the airport? Can I get someone from LocalBitcoins to meet me at the train station to exchange fiat? Where are interesting Bitcoin startups in that country?

At the beginning of my journey I wasn't sure how usable (if at all) Bitcoin would be as a day to day currency in other countries. Remember: Bitcoin just finished its worst year considering exchange rate in 2014.
Until then I only used it Online, in Germany and USA in 2013 - which were super hyped times. Now after trying using it as a currency in "Real Life", meeting these exciting (and excited) people, traders, startups, shows there is no single true use-case for Bitcoin. It has many applications. Many people see different things in it, use it for different reasons. It might take somewhat longer than I originally anticipated, but eventually it will become a universal money. Since the technology behind it is so exciting I don't mind waiting and we should enjoy the ride.
About life: I am even more grateful to be born in these exciting times. I don't mean only Bitcoin. I also mean having all these other great technologies like Google Maps and Translate in your pocket allows you to navigate and communicate with people in different countries easier than ever.

I was actually working on something similar at the 2016 miami bitcoin hackathon this weekend, unfortunately I ran out of time but I will continue the exploration of the topic!
@_date: 2016-03-07 21:35:53
I used to be a BIP101 fan myself. The reasons back then were congurent with why I liked bitcoin in the first place: predictability. I know exactly how much supply of Bitcoin there is today, next month and in 10 years from now. While I dont know the demand in 10 years, I know the maximum supply. Same with BIP101: I would have know the maximum supply of available block space at any point in time. 
Bitcoin Classic unfortunately does not solve much: At the current growth rate, 2 MB blocks will be "full again" in less than a year. The only benefit it might give is we learn how a hard fork will play out. We would gather some data and this might be better if bitcoin is small in terms of market cap and active users. (and it is smaller today than you think if you you only spend your time on r/bitcoin).
After I talked with adam3us and luke-jr in Miami earlier this year my concerns sparked for why uncapped blockchain growth also strongly compromises security. Unfortunately the topic is highly technical and requires good understanding of data sizes and algorithmic complexity (or willingness to listen/spend time learn about it).
tl;dr: Good article and it shows: it's important to keep an open mind to change your position if the data suggests it.

traveling around the world without a credit card or bank account
@_date: 2016-01-13 10:22:09
After converting all my savings to bitcoin, I started my journey on January 12, 2015 in Berlin-Kreuzberg at Room 77. A bar who many here know as the first bar and restaurant in the World to ever accept Bitcoin. Full list of countries visited sorted by timestamp: 
0. Germany
1. Czech Republic
2. Austria
3. Switzerland
4. Slovakia
5. Hungary
6. Rumania
7. Bulgaria
8. Greece
9. Turkey
10. Ukraine
11. Israel
12. Hong Kong
13. Macau
14. Phillipines
15. Australia
16. Japan
And now I am on [Yap Island]( in Micronesia, famous for their [Rai Stone money](
My original goal was to visit 21 countries (for obvious reasons) in 1 year but I enjoyed traveling so much and I got slowed down... Also Bitcoin's fiat value increased over 35% last year, so this allowed me to stretch my journey a bit. I intend to return "home" in about 6 weeks or whenever I have no more money left in the private key.
I haven't used my credit card once last year. In fact I don't even own a credit card anymore. I did not use a Bank ATM or debit card. [Coinmap.org]( and [bitcoin.meetup.com]( were two of the most helpful tools to find places to pay with Bitcoin and meet those awesome bitcoin people all around the world.
And to be clear: Yes, I also used paper money BUT every euro/dollar/crown/franken/hryvnia/shekel/peso/yen I spent was obtained by trading my Bitcoins with a local for their cash (using [localbitcoins.com]( mycelium local trader, Bitcoin ATMs). Usually I tried to convince the merchants to accept bitcoin first, which I often failed - but sometimes did succeed :-)

1) Before you go to a new place, put an ad on LocalBitcoins, mycelium localtrader for cash trades. 
Depending on the depth of the local market you may convert your bitcoin at  2-10% above the market to the local fiat (instead of paying 2-10% at traditional exchanges). How long you have to wait is subject to local demand. Sometimes I got a request within few hours, sometimes none for days.
2) Look on CoinMap.org for a restaurant near you accepting bitcoin.
3) Expedia.com takes Bitcoin for hotels and some hostels.
4) Cheapair.com let's you buy flights and pay with bitcoin.
5) Check meetup.com for weekly/mothly bitcoin meetups in the area you're visiting to find likeminded people.

You can remit bitcoin at very low fee to others (and yourself) with rebit.ph. This works almost everywhere on the different islands.
Also checkout coins.ph. They have a sophisticated wallet which allows you to hold BTC, convert from/to BTC/PHP, to pay for local bills, recharge you prepaid mobile. After I left the Philippines I had some cash over (got 2nd in a poker tournament :D) and used coins.ph to convert the cash to BTC within less than an hour. 
Both awesome services.

Given the amount of real world use cases I saw during my travels, I strongly agree with increasing the blocksize.
As an engineer and global citizen I hope in the future as many people as possible from every country can transact with each other on the blockchain. Paying for coffee probably consumes 2 outputs and create 2 new ones. The UTXO set does not grow. And no it will not be every coffee in the far future but let's KISS until lightning and co are actually ready. Easy UI/UX design for the average user is key and gets harder the more technical details you have to hide. It will take years for lightning to be "ready".
Engineering is always making trade-offs. But the cost of artificially limiting growth now is simply too high. Gavin and Mikes proposal is visionary (Although I prefer to stop doubling at 4GB so I can still store 1 block per file on my FAT32 filesystem in 20 years /s). But their strong push now has also introduced us to other proposals and ended the procrastination. Ultimately the miners will have to decide, they can always set a soft limit later limiting tx throughput if necessary. 
We've come a long way already, let's be brave and scale this thing to global reach!

People of Yap were very welcoming to tourists, the many indigene people like telling you a story or 2 about the island. A couple expats I met there opened and run a hotel now. I almost convinced them to start accepting bitcoin. 
It's not super touristy yet tough, lots and lots of untouched nature. Rumung, the island in the north where the biggest Rai stone lies, was not allowed for foreigners until very recently. You still need a guide and ask for permission from the inhabitants.

When I traveled to Brazil in June 2016 there was actually a 12% higher price on the biggest exchange at the time foxbit (if you use the official exchange rate from XE.com). This varied between 6-12% for almost 3 weeks.
So yes arbitrage is real but usually only for a limited amount of time. And you need to find people willing to help you realise any profit. Getting a Brazilian bank account as a foreigner is pretty time consuming. Different markets have different prices for things especially if liquidity is low. Don't think this is free money tough, there might be hidden costs.
But in theory, if you were US American visiting Brazil for holiday it would be economical to find a human Bitcoin ATM on LocalBitcoins or something, then buy bitcoins in the US and sell them right away to some Brazilian investor. Instead of using your credit card in a foreign country getting ripped of by bad exchange rates and extra fees.
