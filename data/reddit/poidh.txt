I am not familiar with iOS but desperately looking for a mycelium replacement for iOS.
Is there any way to see/restrict what kind of permissions this app has? Because my apple friends are concered that this app can potentially access other data on the phone etc.?

1. If people weren't selling when the price was "tanking", why did the price fell in the first place? A common strategy is to accumulate a stash of bitcoins to speculate on further price increase- for any bitcoin economy needs, you don't spend from your stash (until your price is reached) instead you instantly buy new coins you want to spend. Hence you are holding but at the same time increasing the money velocity.
2. IMHO a good analogy about the deflationary criticism is land. Land is a finite resource (so highly deflationary as the population grows), despite that people are using it as a store of value or trading it. The land itself has a utilty (you can do agriculture or build/rent houses on it), so has bitcoin (despite from payment transaction it has numerous other use cases not fully explored yet, see bitcoin scripting).
Nobody would turn down the offer to get some cheap land in an area with highly rising popularity, nobody would argue that the value will collapse as nobody will sell it etc. would it?

A sidechain is a blockchain from altcoins (Litecoin, Dogecoin, peercoin, mastercoin, etc.) that is linked with Bitcoin.
Existing altcoins are totally separated from bitcoin. This means if you want to own a specific altcoin (for example Litecoin), you have to mine it or buy it on an exchange.
If litecoin would have been implemented as a sidechain on the other hand, you could just "flip" a bitcoin and it would turn into a litecoin.
There would be no other way to create litecoins and the sum of both litecoin and bitcoin would remain constant and 21 million max. (the more litecoins exist, the less bitcoins there are).
At the same time the value of 1 litecoin would be the same as the value of 1 bitcoin and vice versa (it would be "pegged", hence the term two-way-pegging).
This way it would be easier and less riskier to experiment with new blockchain technologies. Currently you would have to buy an altcoin, but if it is not successfull or nobody uses it anymore, it would be hard to sell those coins for bitcoin again (nobody would be interested or price would be very low). If that coin would have been implemented with a sidechain to bitcoin, you could just flip your altcoins 1:1 for bitcoins in the end.
*Like others have pointed out, there is no implementation of this yet. What would work already is one-way-pegging: An altcoin could monitor the bitcoin blockchain and require to destroy bitcoins by sending them to an invalid address (specified by the altcoin). Once the altcoin network sees this bitcoin transaction, it credits the amount you have destroyed as altcoins... obviously this cannot be reversed as the bitcoins are lost.*

Thats a cool idea, I am working on something similar. I'd had set the base price at 1 BTC or more, although that would require some more options

"proof of ID" is not really a proof, since you just need images of these docs. Nobody checks if you are the legitimate owner. So, if you own one of the other exchanges/services that used this kind of "verification" you could just use one of their clients' scanned docs to setup an account, or you got the docs through a hack etc.
Secondly, if someone found a vulnerabilty that allowed him to manipulate his USD account balance then he may also be able to set the verified flag on his account.
If you consider that Mt.Gox had problems with fiat withdrawals for a long time, that story makes sense- someone sold coins (unknowingly) for non existant fiat, so there was not enough to withdraw.
(Besides that I don't think this is relevant to the current price since these theories have been around for months)

AFAIK this thing works more like localbitcoins or the local trader feature of mycelium.
That means, if you use several offers to fill your order (say you buy 1 btc from person A and 0.5 btc from person B to get 1.5 btc in total) you have to deal with those two people separately.
bitsquare helps you to set up special escrow transactions that makes it unattractive to cheat (not pay).
This is nice but in my opinion no competitor to real exchanges like bitstamp, btc-e, etc.

Not within seconds, but safe to say within an hour. Totally not uncommon that the transaction takes 10-20 minutes, and since everything is peer-to-peer based, the receiver may want to wait for a little bit longer to see that other clients confirm the transaction in large numbers.

This is how it is handled on some mining pools. On Deepbit, you can (optionally) lock for payout address "forever". On BTCGuild, you can enable a 24h payout lock- meaning that if your address is changed, you get an email and have to wait for 24h until you can request a payout.

I'm not a big fan of "mining for profit" either (and agree with your post in general), but mining itself is spreading bitcoins isn't it? I mean the difficulty is adjusted to spill out 50 BTC every 10 minutes (for every block discovered), thus when more people start mining, the newly discovered coins will just be spreaded among more people.
@_date: 2011-05-17 16:36:14
Because the dollar is such a volatile currency ;-)

From the interview I assumed he was talking about Januar 2012, since the interview article is dated from march '11. Was surprised about how he could give such an exact date if he plans to work for more than 6 months on it...

Oh yes please, cause general panic. I didn't know about Bitcoins back in the day when they were dirt cheap. Bring 'em back and I'll buy them all :-)
No seriously, 2 BTC/day??? Who wrote this, a five year old? Make it 2000 BTC at least.
@_date: 2011-06-06 15:59:56
Mining takes time.. there are only 300 BTC/hour to mine, which will be spread amongst ALL miners out there.
So if you need a pile of BTCs now, you can only get them by buying.

I think if bitcoins become more popular, bank-like companies will emerge and will be necessary.
If you follow the discussions here and elsewhere in the bitcoin community, you see a lot of examples for this.
Lending money, earning interest rates, safely "store" the coins, etc.
I own some bitcoins and like the project, but I doubt that the system will be widely adopted by the mainstream economy. Maybe some bitcoins 2.0 will.

Isn't this Google thing more or less just another way to transmit your CC data? Instead of reading the data from your card it's transmitted via NFC? So no difference at all.
Of course, Bitcoins should be the fourth paradigm.
@_date: 2011-05-24 14:19:22
Yes, buying mining equipment in hope of selling the coins may turn out costly. But this is because BitCoins are not designed to be mined and sold to USD afterwards.
Mining is for securing the network, not for making profit. This is not a secret, it's stated somewhere in the Wiki that you shouldn't start mining if you just want to make money.
Try to earn BitCoins by starting a business that accepts BitCoins. Watch for other BitCoin business to spend your BitCoins... if the BitCoin economy will grow large enough, the need to exchange Bitcoins for USD will get smaller and smaller.

What mini crash? I'd rather call it mini bubble. It's back to organic growth now.

Since the hashing magic for bitcoin only uses integer math, doing all with double precision floating point operations (like used for scientific supercomputing) is a waste of resources. (this is also a reason why nVidia hardware is less suited for mining!)
I think a machine for getting this much hashing power could be far cheaper if done with custom chip designs for calculating the hashes.
@_date: 2011-05-24 15:04:33
Why yes, I do call it a bubble! I just don't call it a crash. And I'd really appreciate if 1 BTC would go down to about 1 USD or so, because then I'd immediately buy.
But I don't think it's about the whole mining thing... I mean people have been mining while there was no way to sell BitCoins in any way. After that, they have been mining while 1 BTC = 0.004 USD. No way that could have been profitable..
@_date: 2011-05-24 14:29:56
Just hook up a simple online shop and sell something for BitCoins! You'll get way more attention that with any ordinary shop because of all the BitCoin fans wanting to spend their coins. Thats at least what I'm planning :-)

Not sure, but I think this would also result in a lot more network traffic, since the new blocks must be propagated to all nodes in the network.

Last week when a lot of people were reporting hacked accounts despite unique secure passwords and relativley (non-windows) secure working environments, I bought BTC from my remaining money on MtGox and transferred everything to my wallet.
Before that, I also transfered my freshly bought Bitcoins to my wallet. **To protect me from myself**!
Before that, my plan was to invest in BTC long term, but from the volatile market movements I was tempted several time to sell BTCs which costs me a lot of money. My investment is still profitable, but I could have been a lot more, I had hold still.
So now, I have my BTCs stashed away and I cannot sell them quickly because the wallet is not accessible to me where I am now.
Remember, it's only one exchange that has been compromised. BTC existed without MtGox and will continue to exist, should MtGox vanish.
**TL;DR**: I'll keep my coins and will try not to look at the exchange rate for a couple of days/weeks. My plan is to cash out in a year the soonest.

Ok, then I'll give you 100.000 USD, please make me 50.000 BTC, delivery tomorrow.
Oh you can't because there are only 50.000 BTC issued per week, in the whole network? And you only get a fraction of these?
Now that may be the reason why you have to pay a "premium" to get these coins!
@_date: 2011-06-13 22:40:39
Well I think you got my point and we have the same opinion.
He said that $22 is to high, because the "real" cost of creating 1 BTC are much lower. But I said the costs of creating 1 BTC are not (so much) relevant to the market price, because the supply of fresh BTCs is so limited (300 BTC/h).
It's the same with concert tickets on the black market. The price may be higher than the "value" (the price the ticket was when originally sold). But becuase there is no other way to get that ticket (sold out), you have to pay a premium.

Compare it to the .com-Bubble. Even after the crash in the 2000s it was still possible to get rich with a good idea (see YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, etc.)
Just don't do what everybody does (buy or mine) (at least don't do that exclusivley), but build something upon your unique ideas. For instance, provide some crucial services (clearing, wallet management, shops, etc.).
