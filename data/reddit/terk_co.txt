Thanks. Yes, I have this on my todo list. It should be included in one of the next updates.

I don't choose what CMS people use and Wordpress is by far the most popular CMS worldwide.
There are no private keys stored or managed by the plugin and no sensitive data is kept in the Wordpress database. The plugin uses blockchain.info API to create per-post addresses and to immediately forward them to your destination address.
If your Wordpress is hacked, tips that you received until then are 100% secure. What the attacker could do is to change the destination address which tips are forwarded to and then change all per-post addresses (because once forwarding is setup, it cannot be redirected to another address - so he needs to change all existing per-post addresses too). Only then tips would be sent to attacker's address - and only until you notice that you've been hacked or that you stopped receiving tips.
This makes it relatively secure (I'd say as secure as you can get with Wordpress).

Plugin author here, in case you'd like to share feedback or feature ideas.

In most cases they show up and are forwarded to destination address immediately.
There's a minimum amount of 0.001 BTC needed to trigger the forward. If the tip is smaller, it will be forwarded with next tip as soon as the balance is 0.001 BTC or more (this is the case with forwarding only - even small tips are detected and included in stats/notifications immediately).
