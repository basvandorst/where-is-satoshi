This might be the most absurd thing every typed in this subreddit. 
US Bonds have had [200 years]( of positive returns. If you're afraid of inflation, you can buy TIPS that will literally guarantee a real return. 
Bitcoin has existed for &lt;5 years. It's lost 50% of it's value on multiple occasions. It is nearly impossible to achieve 99.9% security of your wallet (hard drive failure / hacker / house fire / concussion / etc.) and there is no insurance if something were to happen. There is no definition of the word 'risk' which makes your assertion true.

WTF, really?  I've only seen the generic PHP criticisms, you can't be serious that they were using floats to keep track of money right?

Yeah, you're right, it seems I missed that bit.
I was just remembering all the delays people were seeing and orders not clearing on the various exchanges. They might not actually have been on Gox.

How does the Bitcointip bot work? If someone hacks your reddit account, and just decides to tip at random (or to himself), do you lose all your BTCs?

Your own article disagrees.. 


They lost it in *Europe* but it's still apparently valid in the US. Here's a source from 2010 that the USPTO confirmed the validity of the patent:

The whole point of an exchange is to guarantee a rate. Yes, they match buyers and sellers, but when the bid and the ask match up, the exchange *should* hold that price and complete the transaction *at that price*, not at some random price in the future. Mt. Gox failed at even the basic operations of an exchange.

No, this explains why they're against Bitcoin: 






Not everything is a conspiracy. The fact that JP Morgan (the person) was involved with the creation of the Federal Reserve over 100 years ago has little bearing on how JP Morgan (the $2T AUM, 250k employee company) acts.

Oddly enough, it wasn't loading before, I assumed it was a rehash of the previous articles that all ignored M-Pesa... amended my comment, thanks for the heads up.

Nah, this is a different scenario.  Wells Fargo and Morgan Stanley were in the group that you're describing (the [forced bailouts]( but Goldman wasn't a retail bank, so they weren't a focus of those actions. 
They do however loudly proclaim that they never took bailout money, but they essentially did since AIG was insolvent and would never be able to pay the collateral on the CDS that Goldman had written. The government bailed out AIG, which then paid its creditors (including $13B to Goldman).  Their argument that they were responsible enough to not need government money is dramatically weakened when it becomes clear that without the bailout of AIG, Goldman would've been bankrupt as well.

Sort of..  When the government shut down Full Tilt, it became clear that it was a complete Ponzi scheme and that the owners had taken over $300 million from 'sandboxed' player accounts. The founder pled guilty last April.

Because they're helpful when dealing with large numbers.. some of our treasury work is in the 100s of millions. Spacing and commas make the difference between 121234123 and 12123123 very clear.

Janet Yellen isn't the only employee at the Federal Reserve. The member banks have [18,000 employees]( I'd imagine a fair number are bankers who work for a central bank.. aka.. 'Central Bankers'.

If your money goes from Bank A -&gt; Bank B, you can call Bank B to verify the transaction.
If your money goes from Wallet A -&gt; Wallet B, there is no way of telling who's in control of your money or where they are in the world. 
That's a fairly substantial difference worth noting in this type of document.

This isn't great advice.. Synthetic oil and higher capacity fuel filters have  made a huge difference. The manufacturer recommended intervals are upwards of 10k in most new cars, and chemical analysis on the worn oil has proven this schedule out.

They needed a very questionable AIG bailout to stave off bankruptcy. Of course the US Treasury obliged and paid them in full, with no haircut for their reckless trading.  At the time, the $13B payment was more than 50% of their market cap.
