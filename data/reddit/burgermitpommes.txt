Ok thanks a lot. I now see the mechanism by which a miner signals support for various changes independently using the Version field in the block header.
But I'm still confused about the 2 BIPs and the 2 SegWits :/
If I write a few sentences, please correct any of the following which demonstrates flaws in my understanding:
- BIP 9 was a proposal which every Bitcoin Core full node has accepted by now, presumably it came out in an update many months or yrs ago. Among other things, it implements code which means for future BIPs, if 95% of blocks signal approval then automatically all Bitcoin Core nodes implement the update. I'm not sure how they define 95% approval but a guess would be if 95% of blocks which are mined between two given epoch times support... 
- BIP 141 is the basic SegWit proposal. It has received around 30% support from miners, so is nowhere near the 95% required by BIP 9. Not gonna happen. So BIP 148 has been proposed  
- If you update to a Core node which runs BIP 148, then after Aug 1st it will reject blocks which don't signal support for SegWit. If no miners produce blocks under the new protocol then BIP 148 nodes sit dormant. If one or more miners support the BIP 148 protocol, then for the BIP 148 nodes they will have 100% (&gt;95%) block consensus so (according to BIP 9) SegWit will become active on these nodes after some designated window.
Is there anything messed up about the above?^
Also, what exactly is 'current SegWit2x'? Is it a BIP?

So does anyone actually know the difference between segwit and segwit2x? I'm not looking for another opinionated statement with no technical content

What does 'bit1' and 'bit4' mean here please? I know its something to do with the implementation of UASF/core version but don't understand it yet

[Re: Segwit2x] "This tries a similar trick but first relies on 80% of miners saying they are ready and support it"
What? But BIP9 insists we need 95% hash power for it to come into effect. I'm so confused by this
