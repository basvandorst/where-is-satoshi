= confiscated as a routine part of a criminal arrest. Let's not pretend DPR is an innocent bystander here. While technically this hasn't yet been to trial, the evidence is pretty much all there. They shut the site, so it's confirmed they had that, they have the BTC so again pretty clear cut.

If someone stole 10% of bitcoin using a flaw, it would be enough to ruin the currency, if someone stole 10% of USD from a bank, it would be amazing but not currency crippling. If they managed to steal it due to a repeatable flaw, then even 1% would be enough.

I believe in that situation when there is that much evidence, a warrant can be obtained to have you surrender passwords or face further charges. I doubt much more than that would be needed, and if any other method was used, we'd soon know about it.

Interesting theory. The rival product must have a solution to this "flaw" or it would not earn the trust, but I suppose that's possible.

No I totally agree, as long as we don't have the right to put whatever we want into our own bodies, we are not free. That said, laws are laws. He knew what he was doing and he knew the risks, it paid him handsomely! But he messed up and got caught, that was his mistake.

The perfect answer, I have nothing to add or argue but a simple upvote didn't do it justice.

If GHash.io stole a penny using a flaw for which they could have stolen every bitcoin. Would the value of bitcoin not virtually zero out? Thus making the motivation FOR such an attack be not nearly as profitable as it looks on the surface. The Bitcoin network would collapse, and GHash.io would lose everything themselves.

What was his side of the story. His side of the story was "I didn't do it". There isn't much more to say when you plead not guilty. 
I don't agree with the law either, and I have used Silk Road, and I do like what it's done to a seedy, underground, dangerous activity and made it much safer and down to personal choice.
However the law is the law, he knew it was the law when he started, he's tried to wriggle out fair play, but at the end of the day he got caught. The evidence was against him, even his supporters knew he was guilty of the "crime" whether they agree it should be a crime or not.
I have sympathy, but he knew what the risks were and he made a mistake. Under these circumstances, I'm going to encourage the downvotes for [this meme](

Understanding Bitcoin and Tor is not essential to the case, although I'm sure he spent some time learning something about the technology at the time. Knowing DPR ran an online marketplace allowing people to sell anything, including/(especially) illegal contraband, and pinning that activity on Ulbricht was the crux of the case. Doesn't matter which finger pulled the trigger, only by whom those fingers are owned
Understanding the technology further before sentencing I assume allows a judge to decide what lengths the accused went to, how wide a reach that realistically had so as to allow him to estimate the potential "damage" caused. 
With no precidence, I can only assume that he had maximum distribution when compared to an average seller, so if they hit him with peddling, I can only guess max terms allowed. We have to remember Silk Road wasn't just about a gram of weed, but large volume class A shit, guns etc. It's a landmark case IMO and could actually be used for the sentencing of other DNM owners.

The push and pull bits should be top because it's nice and plain English (although as a mobile developer wannabe, I secretly hate it). Using a card is like giving the vendor your private key to take money from your account. Using cash and Bitcoin as you say is push (cringe)... can we just use "give" and "take" instead :-p

He's smart enough to program a digital currency which has made people millionaires in a year, which has been studied and could actually stand the tests of time, with no way of hacking, adding currency etc. but he can't learn English. I never had 15 years of advanced English classes, in fact I could speak reasonably good English by the age of 7, ok I'm English so kinda cheating. My wife is not a native speaker, and in just 1 year of living in the UK, her English was pretty fluent. Her only formal training was from school as a foreign language.
You could easily be right, but I don't feel that "He can't be Japanese because he would need 15 years formal English classes" is a fair assumption.
However for balance... saying he is Japanese because he has a name which sounds Japanese or even that "he" is a he, is also a bad assumption in today's wonderfully diverse world ;)

Given the amount of money lost through FBI seizures, hacks and scams, none of which could have been prevented by 2-factor authentication, I would much rather advise not leaving money on the site whatsoever.
Registering a phone linking your account to a physical device which is potentially traceable on a site which could also get seized is probably not a great idea.

If someone else releases a decentralised currency which is as secure and stable as Bitcoin, they will be tried by the public. The fact is there are many alt-coins available which are worth what the public are willing to pay.
You (OP not the comment I'm replying to (hey Tester)) sound like you're talking about a centralised currency however, like a store card owned by Target or Tescos.
Bitcoin has no controller, it's like someone has planted a public park and left it there to grow. Nobody can alter bitcoin, it is just there to use or ignore. The public ignored it for a time and that would have been fine (it's a currency not a cancer, ignore it and it will go away). But the public have chosen to trade it, and it has value. The structure makes it pretty sound.
So if someone releases a new currency centralised around their own business, it becomes a store card or loyalty points. The value of each are determined solely by the company who issue them.
Bitcoin however is like a newly mined metal. Gold is just a metal and Bitcoin can be compared to it. Gold isn't the most useful metal, in fact in terms of usefulness, Iron should be worth more. But Gold is historically used as a form of payment. It is worth whatever someone is willing to pay for it, and that value is a perceived value. Bitcoin is similar, it is an ultimately useless commodity, but it is rare and measurable. This means that anyone attaching a value to it knows exactly how much of it there is (unlike Gold where more can be discovered)
Rewind to the source of money as a way to exchange x resource for y resource, bitcoin makes sense as an alternative currency.

If they had millions in their own stashes, it would make the currency very sketchy and people wouldn't buy in so easily
As for Bitcoin clones, we have Litecoin, Peercoin, Zetacoin and Namecoin already

The Zimbabwean Dollar had the disadvantage of a weak government. The USD, GBP and others will remain strong because they have strong government backing. When GBP spikes, the Bank of England increase interest rates, the government raises taxes to bring it back down. When it drops the opposite happens. GBP and USD mean something to every retailer in their respective countries and more importantly to successful governments. And as long as this continues, the GBP and USD will always have a value.
Bitcoin has value from its people. Yes most of the volatility comes from it being an emerging currency. I love it, I'm a great supporter. But I'm under no dellusion. Bitcoin will always be more volatile than any other currency because nobody is controlling it. Bitcoin will spike out of control because nobody can keep it down, and it can drop to 0 because nobody is there to save it. Longest term, Bitcoin cannot last forever because it is not future proof, however it has legs for now and that's something we can use and enjoy in the meantime.

The value of anything is easily manipulated when a large player like BOA comes in
