It might though. All we know is no way has been made public yet. Personally i would not touch anything Bitcoin on anything other than a Mac, just in case.

I'm shadowbanned. Was wondering why nothing was updating since yesterday. I logged out today, checked my profile and it says the account is restricted..  Everything looked normal except that no new items were in my news feed.

When you put it like that it sounds like a negative. Why would the 99.9% use a currency only the .1% hold. 
Its like expecting the world to run on 21m USD instead of just switching to Euro's

How would someone rebuild the wallet using the words and check teh balance?

As oppose to January, when it was the worst possible thing you could do.

No, i don't think you are missing anything. Of course any web wallet has to store your keys on its servers. 
This is stupid that everyone is saying to blacklist them. Just goes to show what they know about Crypto.

People do this all the time. If the copy is identical it can be and is accepted as the original. The only solution to this is to continuously improve the original to make it harder to replicate.

I'm not sure this is as supportive an argument as you think it is. RIM turned out to be not too valuable because anyone could create a smartphone and someone made a better one. Myspace, East India Company found out the same. The Roman empire, British Empires all fell because someone replicated what they did and did it better.

So, yes then. 
Already 15% or 20% is gone for good. How long before it's all gone for good?

Actually, Silver, Platinum and palladium have the same properties, however those three look the same. Gold is the only one to be easily identifiable of the noble metals.

None of us really know what it’s called. That’s because we are in a retail investor chat with a bunch of people pretending to be pros and pretending that their advice is educated. They are all trying to convince themselves that charts don’t matter unless it’s up trending and will throw out literally any explanation to justify their decision to hang tight and pray

A better question is how do you find his public key to verify the message.

Wow, Had no idea. I assume people who want to sign register them there?

They are struggling too. They have to change the email address every now and then and the transfers get blocked. They are getting away with it now because the volume is low, but they won't be able to scale to larger volumes without finding a solution to offshore banking. 
Grade A customer support though. I hope they do work it out.

How long did the verification take to complete?

You should read up on Anti Money Laundering regulations. You are being naive to think you can just deposit loads ofcash and tell the bank its none of their business when they ask where it comes from. 
EDIT: He deleted his comment, but his base strategy was cash is legal and its none of the banks business how you got it so just tell them that and they will open your account right back up.
