Exactly. big money is shorting this market. that's why prices are down. do people think it's just by chance the market went up like crazy in Nov/Dec ahead of futures on CBOE/CME...then just so happened most contracts were SHORT, then just so happened the price goes down.....hmmm...I wonder 
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:11:20
pros = institutional money dumbass. who do you think has all the money in this world? it's institutional money that will drive this in the future. it's certainly not hairdressers and their 0.00000001 BTC purchases. A 100 BTC investment for an F500 company and investment banks is a rounding error for them. 
Do you have absolutely no idea how the financial markets work and where the money is? Crypto is currently 0.4% of the total wealth of this planet at most. Don't you think that the higher the price goes for those buying, the better? Institutions like to make money..and the higher the price goes the more money they make. Get it? That's why stock markets rise. That's what real estate prices go up. 
It's already been past $19K and tested $20K. Why is it so outlandish to think when this bearish sentiment turns bullish that those that bought above $12K won't do it again? It's surprising how little people who comment here understand how the financial world works. Yet they have no problem voicing their useless, uneducated opinions 
Don't make me laugh with your hairdresser comment. There's a saying in finance that when the dentists of the world start buying that's when to sell. Yet you're saying when a hairdresser starts selling that's reason to panic. You're so retarded that I can't believe I just wasted 2 minutes of my time replying to you

because the Nasdaq was highly overvalued. Some might say this is too. But if you look at individual stocks in the Nasdaq - not the overall index - the winners are up multiples and multiples of where they were at the previous peak. Unlike you I was working on Wall Street during the Nasdaq bubble so I was it firsthand. Are you saying that pretty much every major telecom today, Apple, Samsung, Amazon, etc are not worth a HELL OF A LOT MORE now than they were worth then?
The same thing will happen in crypto. The best coins/tokens will recover quickly and the ones that should die will die. But there are plenty of Nasdaq traded companies that VASTLY outperformed the index 
It seems people that think because they're from the fiat world that they by definition know so much more than those in the crypto world...and look down on those "millennials" in the crypto world....are the same jackasses that make the EXACT SAME MISTAKES in the fiat world as "noobs" are making in this world. It's that smug know it all attitude - yet you clearly don't know shit

why devalue the coins (180k) he still holds? Especially after the $414M is paid...

@_date: 2018-02-26 06:36:01
I'm surprised it's only 40%. Vancouver, NYC, SF, LA, London, etc...seems they're at least double since then. Real estate prices are up 3-10X in those cities. Restaurants and grocery stores pay rent overhead. Not to mention shipping costs with increasing gas/fuel costs. 
The posted inflation numbers are always SO MUCH LOWER than the ACTUAL inflation numbers....since the basket of goods they use is from the 1800s and they don't include housing costs and gas prices (how convenient) when calculating. That's so they can say only 2% inflation? Well then we only have to give you a 2% increase in salary. Meanwhile house prices just went up 20% and your gas up 15% - two of your biggest expenses - in the same time.

so you're telling us that "regulated" assets can't be risky?
I had to laugh at that comment. 
Yes no stock or junk bond or highly leveraged real estate asset or mortgage backed security or asset backed security....or...or...or...can be risky and volatile 
Concerns for riks at financial institutions went out the window with the repeal of Glass-Steagall in '99
Remember the Great Recession of 2008? Satoshi Nakamura does. The ability for banks and insurance companies to take on derivatives and other risky assets is what directly led to the Great Recession. In fact it caused it. That and highly leveraged mortgage positions whose risk was "transferred" off banks balance sheets to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, so they could take on yet ore risk...so that there was risk not only at the banks levels but trillions of it in the hands of government agencies and thus the taxpayer. I can send you a link to the Great Recession of 2008 if you'd like? Perhaps you haven't heard of it and/or know literally nothing about how it was caused. 
That was the reason Satoshi Nakamura invested Bitcoin. To decentralize and among other things take control away from those greedy banksters who because of the risks you're referring to completely destroyed the economy.  
Once again your comments and concerns are LAUGHABLE
So endeth the lesson. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:05:23
Not to mention the BIG reason for accepting crypto - which is the value of the fees they charge in crypto will go up over time, so like exchanges that charge you in crypto and keep the "rounding error" balances too small for you to trade, they are accumulating crypto long term. Any price paid now in Bitcoin vs. USD will be worth a LOT more over time. Imagine the amount of money expedia has made in BTC appreciation over time.

how does bitconnect - a MLM lending platform - equal bitcoin and cryptocurrencies?
Are you one of these people that know one thing about a topic then automatically assign that one word to make you sound like you know what you're talking about when it's clear you know nothing? Do you even know what happened with Bitconnect and why your comment is so retarded? And just how apples and oranges your comment is? Why does the US dollar have value? And I'm sure you believe no criminals ever launder the US dollar or keep it secret from the government. You're either 4 years old or not intelligent to comment here...or both

If you look at his need to sell and raise $414M to pay creditors, his 40k sold BTC would have generated enough $ at those prices. Now he sits on 180k BTC. I'm sure he would rather have the price go UP than down. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:14:05

yeah it goes both ways. you just have to be on the right side of the trade. those that bully the price to go the way they want it are quite often on the right side of the trade, up or down. But volatility creates more opportunities to make big money

there's no price decrease if 10 million new entrants/buyers come into the market and buy at $510

You lost me at Bitcconnect equals Bitcoin and your implication that middlemen somehow how our best interest at heart or provide any safety
Clearly you've never done a deal in your life. Or bought a house. Or stock. Or had any rationale, analytical thought for that matter. 
Bartering? What are you talking about. There's a buyer and a seller. The seller loses money by going through a middleman (the dealership) and the buyer pays more by buying it at an inflated price through that dealer. The dealer is making money unnecessarily 
Your logic actually suggests we should trust a used car salesman. Do you actually read what you type? Or are you a pre-programmed automaton that just says whatever he reads I the media or what he's told. If you don't learn to think for yourself you'll find yourself replaced by a robot one day.

oh yes the good ole American government. always looking out for your best interest. no one ever loses money through banks...
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:36:13
it's called institutional money. institutional money entering the market in Nov/early Dec drove up the price ahead of futures contracts....bought up BTC and then at $15-20K shorted the leveraged futures, then sold their underlying BTC they bought to push down the price...again and again...all the while FUD was kicking in, to push BTC back down to where they bought in Nov....it was done to 1. make a shit ton of money on original BTC long positions AND short futures positions 2. get rid of the "amateurs" like your hairdresser and buy it all back at bargain basement prices. Then drive the price up again...we'll see an even higher price the next time around before they do this again. This is what professionals do. Just watch the penny stock OTC market for a while and you'll see how manipulated it is. Only this market is even less regulated and operates 24/7. And can be driven up and down with a small % of their wealth vs ours. The entire crypto market is half of Apple's MC. Easy to manipulate, but no good for everyone if the prices don't go up again. These guys do like their money. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:17:29

accurate pricing? Why does a measure of extreme volatility have to be present for accurate pricing?
So are you saying that stocks, bonds, real estate, artwork, private businesses etc are all "accurately priced" If yes then you clearly know nothing of how pricing works. that's why the stock market and bond market and real estate bubbles burst all the time. Don't think they're any different you smug moron 
@_date: 2018-02-20 09:14:20
Because if you're bullish in Bitcoin you'd be getting a SIGNIFICANT raise in salary
If I'm getting $11K a month so say 1 BTC, if bitcoin goes to $20k/BTC I'm getting $20K a month not $11k. At $11k a month I'd be buying 0.55 bitcoin instead of 1.0 bitcoin
It's a very smart move (if you're bullish on bitcoin), I just wonder at what price level will your boss stop paying you lol

So let's take a roll call and see who outside of the Central Bank of China, who's secretly making their own cryptocurrency, are there any governments or banks that haven't supported Bitcoin and Crypto in the last 48 hours? Seems like prices should already be at the moon by now with the amount of support it's getting. Clearly they move in herds or the global switch from FUD to sunshine-pumpers memo was circulated 
It's a bargain under $9K!!! And will likely be one under $19K too....
Can't believe the European Central Bank's comments didn't cause the price to double in hours....apparently few understand what that statement really means. Ummm...just so everyone is aware...central banks literally print fiat...so they umm....have a LOT OF MONEY to invest

who says institutions, banks and everyone else aren't entering this market? How many new accounts are being created every.single.day??
I think you're confusing people that are SHORTING the market, often on purpose to drive the price down, with people entering a market, then you have no idea what you're talking about. You know you can short bitcoin right? Do you know what shorting means? 
and yes you sound like an elitist dickhead. I'm sure you've never jumped into a stock or a car purchase or house purchase or spent too much money on anything. How much does anyone know about any market condition? Are you invested in any of these now? 1. stocks 2. bonds 3. real estate 4. private companies
If you believe you know everything about what affects the price of those 4 you're LYING and/or fooling yourself

because they're making a killing off fees and the guys that own coinbase are trying to kill BTC in favor of their own centralized coins 
yes and where is Amazon now? How many multiples is it up since the crash? SO what's your damn point. Seriously go look at the '99/'00 market cap on Amazon and look at it now, calculate the ROI for those 18-19 years, then come back with something intelligent to tell me. Otherwise, quit wasting my time 
I agree BTC is falling because some holders are selling, but more likely than not it's the new buyers from the Thanksgiving and Christmas hype that lost their shirts and are panic selling. You people blame the hodl'ers....but they're the ones remaining calm in all this
Again, what the hell does Tether and Bitfinex have to do with Bitcoin? NOTHING. And what does Bitconnect have to do with Bitcoin. NOTHING. You're literally talking about 2 totally unrelated things. Aside from the fact they both involve the crypto world. But they have nothing to do with Bitcoin. In fact they're all different currencies. It's like saying the Yen is to blame for the Rand's demise. Totally unrelated. And now based on your logic we shouldn't trust the US dollar. 
Of course it's falling because people who held it are selling it. Did you get your finance degree out of a cereal box? Jesus Christ you're retarded 
And yes I am buying Bitcoin now. If you're not, can I ask you why you're on a Bitcoin reddit wasting my time?

@_date: 2018-02-05 15:13:43
but the bottom line is - what does any of this have to do with Bitcoin???
We all know these exchanges are dirty as hell. Coinbase and their refusal to adopt Segwit is the reason (them and Roger Ver throwing Bitcoing under the bus on CNBC) that high fees and slow transaction times exist. 
So why does Bitcoin suffer? Because the media is only picking up on everything negative about Bitcoin. And why is that? Because the companies and individuals that own the bulk of the media want Bitcoin to fail. And why is that? Because it threatens their very power structure and why they're so rich and powerful in the first place that they can own a media company.

So you don't hold fiat currency when economic times are tough?
that's exactly when you hold currency
they're holding because they're weathering the storm. that's where the original hodling came from. Which is what they're doing
I'm 47 and have 30 years of trading markets you fuck-twat. You clearly have zero idea what you're talking about 
Take your holier-than-thou know it all but know nothing attitude and get off a bitcoin reddit if all your doing is piling on when the price is down. You're just an angry man that didn't get in early on a revolutionary tech and is pissed the young people are making money while you're still sending messages from your mom's basement 
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:59:04
significant fees and long transaction times ARE THE EXCHANGES LIKE COINBASE THAT REFUSE TO ADOPT SEGWIT AND LIGHTNING to significantly reduce those fees and transaction times
WHY? Because 1. quick cheap transactions doesn't make them a pile in unnecessary fees 2. they can promote their centralized coins that they own a chunk of
That fees and long transaction time argument is so 2017. Get your head out of your ass and actually research why this is happening. the technology is there - it's that it's not being adopted by greedy exchanges and "news" agencies that you obviously follow to get your slanted, incorrect point of view gobble it up because they want to kill bitcoin because of what it represents - diverting money and power from those that currently have it. Never in the history of human kind has anyone or organization that had power given it up so easily...why would they now? But that you actually believe this crap is a testament to how little you know about how the world works.  
Oh the contrary, the banks are shitting themselves. That's why they're either secretly buying (JP Morgan, B of A, etc) bitcoin and crypto while publicly skewering and/or starting their own coin LIKE THE CENTRAL BANK OF CHINA
but oh yeah they're not afraid nor see the value in it 
alo, what the hell are you doing on a Bitcoin reddit board if you have this distorted point of view? Shouldn't you be at church learning about the "word of god"?
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:09:44

@_date: 2018-02-05 11:41:07
you're kidding right? thats the funniest thing I've ever heard. news is not "news". How many of the "news" agencies are run by corporations or wealthy individuals with an agenda? LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. if you for one second believe that they don't choose only the negative on Bitcoin to report just to benefit themselves and maintain power then I'm sorry but you're mentally retarded. or an automaton. OR BOTH.
I worked in investment and commercial banking for 30 years in literally every sector of finance and a masters and undergrad in finance - what's your background? 
I know EXACTLY how the central banks operate. There's a reason the US is in constant conflict with the very few countries left that don't have central banks. Don't kid yourself, decentralization - the ability to control money supply and monetary policy...and the ability to TAX - is exactly what scares the hell out of them the most. It will literally remove their power. Do you think they do not care about power and money being taken away from them?
Question - how long have the central banks been in control of the money supply? Answer less than some people in this world have been alive. So they have all the right in the world to be afraid that anther system will replace them
Take your head out of the sand - or better yet, out of your ass - and maybe think for a change instead of believing every single thing you're told. My guess is your either Catholic or some type of Christian, otherwise you wouldn't be so easily sold a fake bill of goods. Wake up.

So if millions of HODLers never sell at $500 and one person buys at $510 and one sells at $510, the transaction is zero sum but all the HODLers that didn't sell made $10 * millions
How is that zero sum?

how so? because you're on an exchange (likely coinbase) that hasn't adopted segwit or lightning...so are the ones doing this to charge you more money in fees

Bitcoin is still...and always will be...the King. Bitcoin literally moves every other crypto out there. When Bitcoin sneezes, every other coin is affected.

There's Bitcoin...and there's everyone else.
