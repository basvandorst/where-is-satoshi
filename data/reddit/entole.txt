most dont try to start something as complex as an exchange right away though

@_date: 2017-12-09 04:27:25
it's kind of crazy nothing exists for this kind of thing yet
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:14:10
unfortunately this happens from time to time as you can see here:  
It will eventually go through but it may take a little while for the backlog to clear, you can also try a tx accelerator like this one:

a scam ontop of a scam... scamception

glad some guys in the space are still keeping it real and arent just chasing the money
@_date: 2017-01-22 13:26:39
is cex.io actually trustworthy?  it seems so many people have problems withdrawing from them
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:36:44
why would they pay 2% annually when they can just buy them on spot themselves?
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:24:42
Or Trace Mayer if they want to talk to early investors
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:51:45
denial and soon panic
@_date: 2018-06-14 15:37:56
yes first comes store of value, maybe far down the line once everyone owns some it can be used as a currency
no one is going to buy this just to use it as a currency when they have other options, far too much hassle for most people
@_date: 2018-06-15 14:11:45
what is true? it's literally just someone spouting off something they have hardly thought about
he doesnt understand the need for btc at all, he thinks the world is fair and just because of where he is at
@_date: 2018-06-04 17:26:25
is sjw mentality coming to crypto now?  I'm glad someone has opposing views and isnt just pumping shitcoins
@_date: 2018-06-10 01:10:10
seems like they are trying to work with exchanges to cut down on manipulation before they approve an etf (if it's possible)
@_date: 2018-06-12 03:47:12
yeah likely hashrate either stalling or declining would be my guess...  for now it has only gone up and the inefficient miners havent really been tested
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:37:38
yeah I think so too, like 20 mins after I posted lol
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:56:47
Not op but I bought gta 5 half off yesterday, the fee was $2 but I probably overpaid since not much in the mempool right now, I just didnt want to wait.
It seemed to work instantly this time so maybe bitpay has changed it so you dont need confirmations?  It would allow for very low fees... Can anyone confirm?
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:13:00
It wasn’t just roger but his was more obvious
They have literally laid out their plan entirely for anyone to read 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:50:45
It's a real problem for a lot of people apparently, its not useful to dismiss it entirely
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:31:51
News flash: bch won’t be able to be used as a currency either 
Changing the block size is a linear solution to an exponential problem
@_date: 2017-11-09 07:11:51
bch offers nothing but a short term scaling solution.
Hell they would be fine with having 1mb blocks because there are so few transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:29:16
Pow change pls
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:00:44
It’s a deflationary asset, ie banks can’t print more out of thin air like fiat
Yes it is probably worse since stocks at least are regulated.  If you have someone with enough money they are going to move the market, intentional or not.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:31:19
yes but there were a ton of accounts everywhere spamming how much greater bcash was and that it was the new bitcoin while the pump was going on... some people lost a lot of money because of this.
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:17:50
Time for a new dog
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:38:02
Look up the term anti fragile.  If he decides to sell more coins he will eventually run out and now these coins would be spread out amongst a greater number of users, therefore less chance of it happening again.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:26:30
ok cool thanks
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:06:29
even rsk which is due next month could allow for these kinds of payments off chain
The beauty of sidechains is that there will be competition, if one has too many fees or isnt working that well, another will come along and improve upon that.
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:40:27
And then same story, I don’t know what you’re trying to get at here
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:01:05
They come in huge chunks of 0-10b/sat tx, have a look at the third chart: 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:38:05
And then we finally get a pow change, their coin collapses and they are out of money
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:28:56
lol yeah exactly, most bitmex users are just happy to finally be getting anything for it
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:37:30
have a look at the third chart
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:35:15
its not pure spam but those huge chunks build up and then people are forced to pay higher and higher fees (especially when bcash made miners move away)
Also lightning network and rsk are solutions to this problem
rsk is expected to be on mainnet in december
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:23:03
the real reason to get an apple watch right here
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:14:52
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:51:34
I prefer this version: 
anytime you see someone reply "bcash is not bitcoin cash" you can reply with this
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:33:06
They want it to cause so much disruption that bch starts to look like a good option
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:44:38
God I hope they fuck it up worse than last time.  That will teach people to trust those fools 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:35:50
This should be a sticky posted everywhere.  Well said.
@_date: 2017-11-11 04:39:39
The miners would still secure the network, just not for every single lightning transaction
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:51:51
That's certainly true as well, people should allow others to make their own financial decisions without trying to fud or attack or manipulate
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:15:13
Do you also believe that Roger Ver is actually Jesus?
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:32:02
Vitalik is just thinking about his own interests
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:10:50
This is definitely a problem but can we leave the andreas talk as a sticky? I think it is very important for noobs to see.
@_date: 2017-11-08 23:25:12
I wish there was a word that described Darwinism for financial decisions
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:48:59
And then they go back to their safe space and complain about censorship 
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:22:48
The price can obviously to an extent, but we were overdue for a correction anyways so maybe them selling 100s of thousands of coins just expedited it
As btc grows larger this will be harder to do
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:48:09
It wasn’t just because of him and there was certainly some hype around bch at that time
What you are describing can be done with any other coin or stock, the ones with lower market caps would be even easier
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:18:09
They just want to remain neutral and temper some of the hostility between the sides.  I dont think they can coexist simply because they use the same hashing algorithm.  If we get a pow change maybe then they can coexist.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:16:37
rsk is about a month away from being on the main-net as well
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:45:06
The worst part about this is that Roger Ver doesnt lose his 1000btc bet
@_date: 2018-11-01 23:39:35
maybe even less
@_date: 2018-11-27 09:33:14
im sure a lot of miners also take advantage of futures where they can short and maintain whatever price they bought in at
@_date: 2018-11-27 04:45:02
there has been plenty of adoption, just not used much for mainstream things yet
I like these capitulation posts though
@_date: 2018-11-27 05:04:20
I never said that
@_date: 2019-01-30 02:45:26
its not meant for the average person, it's targeted at hedge funds
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:30:50
“Today, bitcoin faces existential threats from forks, developer drama and so on. Knowing what we know and having a clean sheet of paper, we asked what  would we build and the answer is this,” Garzik said.
Literally its a solution to a problem he is helping to perpetuate
@_date: 2017-10-10 15:32:32
This is part of the reason I've been thinking about putting some of my money in a pos coin like decred, at most thieves would only be able to steal a tiny bit before you realize you are compromised 
@_date: 2017-09-14 02:03:03
how is it different from the other stories claiming they are banned?
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:43:44
is there a plan for afterwards?
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:27:28
his reputation died for our profits
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:18:06
Could this already be starting to happen?  I mean Bch is rising and btc mempool has 75k transactions
Man the core devs need to do something soon
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:03:35
but not too busy to complain about it all the time
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:02:50
not to mention owning bitcoin.com and trying to take out of context satoshi quotes to further his own political agenda
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:56:50
even with the s2x fork?
@_date: 2017-10-10 15:02:03
Good fucking lord, if for some insane reason b2x becomes the main chain I am selling all my coins and calling btc a failed experiment
@_date: 2017-10-03 04:15:49
jaxx is fine for short term holding, but you'd want something more secure for longer term
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:31:41
Sure but clearly this isnt a real disagreement and is just being used as an excuse to launch another shitcoin ico
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:54:35
Can we just do 2mb blocks and avoid all these forks and make the miners happy for a while?
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:56:01
he is already retired lol
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:20:32
I certainly see this argument but just because they concede now doesnt mean they have to concede in the future.  There will probably be more important issues in the future where they have to put their feet down, but I just dont think that a 2mb block is one of them.
At the very least it would buy them time until more manufacturers are making asic miners.
@_date: 2017-10-28 10:41:52
This is the real plan right here, clearly this is why there has been no development on s2x and J.Garzik is working on his own project
@_date: 2018-04-23 23:34:07
lol what a petty manchild
he is so desperate it is pathetic
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:11:49
what would happen to bcash if they didnt have ver promoting/pumping it?
imo it would be worse for them then vitalik leaving eth
@_date: 2018-12-07 04:23:27
theoretically? btc has a 10 year advantage when it comes to security, it takes a while to build that kind of trust where people are comfortable putting money into something as risky as this
we've already seen it with eth and others, eventually btc will just adapt and improve and take ideas from other cryptos
@_date: 2018-12-16 16:11:32
I dont carry change around but I always have my keys with me
its basically just a keychain that you can use in shopping carts... why do ppl buy keychains?
the way they marketed it is dumb tho
