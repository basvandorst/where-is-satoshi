Chainpoint is a standard for anchoring data and verifying proofs. It's designed to be flexible to accommodate anchoring in multiple sources and using different hashing algorithms. See "anchor type" in the spec at  It might be possible to add Peter's method as an anchor type to Chainpoint. I spoke with Peter about this at the MIT W3C Blockchain event in June. I'll follow up with him this week.
Here are some of the benefits of the new version.
* Uses JSON-LD, allowing for optional digital signatures
* Chainpoint receipts can be embedded within JSON-LD documents
* Supports multiple anchor points into multiple blockchains
* SHA-2 and SHA-3 support, extensible to other hashing algorithms
* Receipt format has been significantly reduced in size

The basic idea behind OpenTimeStamp's anchoring method is "you can create a path of generic operations from the document to the hash of a block you are proving that the document is committing to that block." I don't see why that method can't be added as an anchor type to Chainpoint. Seems like an easy addition to the standard.

Is anyone surprised that banks avoid using the term Bitcoin after years of rhetoric about how Bitcoin is going to destroy the current financial system?
Every new wave of technology comes with a competition to invent the vocabulary used to describe it. Whoever wins gets to say they pioneered the new industry. The recent barrage of blockchain, world wide ledger, distributed ledger, etc. is the same game being played out.

There's some utility in anchoring data in a database to the Bitcoin blockchain.
1) You can verify the content and timestamp of each record.
2) By chaining multiple records together, you can create a verifiable audit trial for how a record transforms over time. Handy for recording business processes, logging usage data, etc.
3) Digital signatures let you verify the source of a record. This will be enhanced in the future with Blockchain ID platforms such as Onename or Keybase.
We're building this (and a good bit more) at [Tierion]( We've created a standard for anchoring data in the blockchain that requires no altcoin or dependency on an alternative blockchain. 
Several "blockchain technology" platforms contain neither blocks nor chains. Sadly, the term blockchain is taking on a meaning that doesn't match its original use. I'm okay with that. I'm typing this on my phone. Twenty years ago, the previous sentence would not have made sense.

I'm an early investor in Storj and I fully support the sale of 200BTC of SJCX.
In my view, the concerns expressed by a small number of crowdsale participants is overblown. The value of our investments is based on the growth and adoption of Storj. Anything that helps us reach that goal more quickly is a benefit to everyone.  There's a very good chance that raising 200BTC to accelerate development will raise the value of SJCX. 
**Consider the following:**
* Things in today's world are priced in USD. The price of BTC has fallen over 20% since the crowdsale.  Selling more SJCX helps account for this decline in purchasing power.
* Storj has been very clear that there are 500 million SJCX and that Storj would sell additional coins to raise capital.
* Storj will likely hire employees and raise venture capital. Both of these events will result in more SJCX being sold.
If you're not comfortable with how the Storj team is managing the project, then you should probably sell your SJCX.  At current market prices, you'd make a nice profit (in BTC).

Furthermore, I don't think that people should be upset at TNABC for allowing Paybase to be a premier sponsor. However, I think it's important to distinguish between the speakers who have been invited (and sometimes paid) because of their expertise, and those who have paid to associate themselves and their brand with these experts.

Congratulations! I think people underestimate the impact that decentralized prediction markets could have on the world. The world has too many experts whose pronouncements go untested.
My city of Hartford recently spent nearly $1 billion on a busline that is hardly used. I watch empty buses drive by my window all day long. I used to talk with the guys that did the construction. Not a single one of them thought people would ride the bus. Despite widespread predictions that the busline would be an expensive failure, no one had the courage or authority to speak up. A prediction market could have revealed this critical knowledge in a politically neutral manner. Polling isn't sufficient, because people tell pollsters what they think the pollster wants to hear. But when money is on the line, the truth is revealed.

Good questions. 
1) IMHO, you're correct about other timestamping services requiring a trusted intermediary. The question is the value of this independence. Using several redundant trusted third parties is another possibility to achieve reliability.
2) Forty years is a long time. By then, the blocksize will be huge. It's possible that the only practical way to access forty year old OP_Return data will be through a third party that maintains a full copy of the blockchain. This is especially true for Ethereum. 
Look at protocols like Dropzone that use the Bitcoin blockchain to store messages in Testnet. They have a short time horizon on the immutability and persistence of that data. Likewise, we're focusing on scenarios where there value in using Tierion with a relatively short timeline. For example, building a verifiable record of a sophisticated purchase order that has multiple levels of approval. 
In general, I think it's important to recognize that we're in the early days of a new technology. The economics of how Bitcoin is supported is going to change as the block reward decreases and transaction fees increase. A lot can happen in forty years.

@_date: 2016-01-14 17:40:25
The title of this article misleadingly focused on timestamping. If you need precise timestamping, then the Bitcoin blockchain is a poor choice for all the reasons mentioned above. However, if you want to create a verifiable record of some data or a business process, then anchoring data to a Bitcoin transaction is useful. 
BlockNotary uses [Tierion]( to anchor data in the blockchain. We generate a blockchain receipt for each record submitted to our API. You can store these receipts in your own database or share them with other systems.
@_date: 2016-01-03 03:33:37
I agree with Tim’s basic sentiment. The world already has a plethora of timestamping services and places to publish a hash. If your only utility is anchoring data in the blockchain, then you’re not providing much value. Customers are using [Tierion]( to create a verifiable record of any data or business process. Anchoring data to the Bitcoin blockchain is just one element of providing customers with this capability. [Guardtime]( is great for banks with deep pockets. There’s a whole world of other applications that can benefit from verifiable data.
It’s also important to note that use cases that relying on the long term storage of a hash in the blockchain are risky. The most well known example is Factom wanting to secure land titles. There’s no guarantee that the blockchain will contain the unadulterated copy of data stored in OP_Return in 40 years.

To many, Ethereum IS blockchain. I've seen this over and over again. Executives will say Bitcoin was the first blockchain. It has limited capabilities and is controlled by Chinese miners. Whereas Ethereum is a fully featured blockchain. Major companies are behind Ethereum/Blockchain.
Ideas sometimes matter more than technology. History is littered with great technologies with bad messaging that lost to inferior technologies with good messaging. 
For a year, anyone who said they were skeptical of Ethereum was branded a troll, Bitcoin maximalist, or a fool who couldn't see the future. The Ethereum hype got out of control. I hope this incident with The DAO makes it socially acceptable to be an Ethereum skeptic. I also hope it teaches some humility to the entire Bitcoin/Blockchain community.

It's even worse than you've described. File systems can append or remove data from files. This could affect the hash of the file.  So moving a file from your Windows laptop to your iMac might imperceptibly change the file. Upgrading to a new version of your OS could cause you to get a different hash.
As others have stated, you're best off scanning the document, using OCR to extract the data, serializing the data in a deterministic format, hashing that data, and archiving it along with the scanned image. Unfortunately, this is incredibly difficult to do with a high degree of reliability. Furthermore, you have to pay for the file to be stored.
You're probably better off just signing the document with a service like Hellosign or Docusign and paying them to archive the file for you.
We've thought a lot about these problems at [Tierion]( and are working to address some of them in the next version of the Chainpoint protocol. 
You might also want to follow what the guys at [Storj]( and [IPFS]( are up to.

Chainpoint provides the same core utility as Factom without the need for an altcoin or separate blockchain.
In Factom, you create a Chain and record data as Entries in a Chain. This allows you to chain together a series of Entries. With Chainpoint, we wanted to create a simple protocol for doing scalable proof-of-existence and a standard for generating blockchain receipts.  A key attribute of a blockchain receipt is that it contains all the information needed to verify the data without relying on a trusted third-party. So, if you generate a blockchain receipt using [Tierion]( and then pass that receipt on to another system, you can verify the data simply by checking OP_Return of the specified Bitcoin transaction and using math. There is no dependency on the system that generated the receipt.

For two years, people have been promising that they can do anything with a blockchain in order to promote their altcoin. I've had an inside view into this world. Many of the people positioning themselves as blockchain experts are vastly overstating their skills and experience. It's hard not to be cynical.
That said, i'm optimistic about the use of the Bitcoin blockchain for uses outside of a financial ledger. [Blockstack]( is a community of talented developers that are building open source tools for software developers - including a key/value store and an identity system.
My company, [Tierion]( is an engine for collecting data and recording it in the Bitcoin blockchain. For each record, Tierion generates a blockchain receipt that contains all the information needed to verify the data without relying on a trusted third party. No altcoin required. Tierion scales to handle millions of records without bloating the blockchain. We've created an open standard for notarizing data in the blockchain and generating blockchain receipts called Chainpoint. You can download a draft of the white paper from our web site and checkout the source code on Github.
With Tierion, we wanted the process of securing data in the blockchain to be completely transparent to customers. We're a SaaS application with an easy signup process. You simply interact with our REST API or send us data via web forms and Tierion takes care of the rest. We even interface with [Zapier]( which lets us integrate with over 400 apps. Just the other day, our team was generating blockchain receipts for every email sent and received from a Gmail account. Politicians and folks in highly regulated industries might find that useful.
My point is that we worked hard to build a product that our customers love. If we had spent our time promoting an altcoin or trying to run a crowdsale, we wouldn't have had time to build anything useful. There are lots of folks, just like us, that are using the Bitcoin blockchain in creative ways. The first wave of pretenders has almost passed. I hope you'll be pleasantly surprised by the next wave of innovative companies and projects.

At the end of the article, Chris posits "a futures market for ad impressions". This is pure genius. Digital advertising is highly inefficient. Programmatic buying has just started getting traction among large media buyers.
I'd go a step further and say you could create a futures market for lead generation. Companies spend billions annually on buying leads. The biggest verticals include higher education, insurance, mortgages, and legal services. For example, companies like Plattform and CollegeView aggregate leads from many sources and sell them to colleges for $40+ per lead!  Spending on leads is highly seasonal. Aggregators could allow customers to lock in future rates for certain volume of leads.
It's interesting to think of leads and ad impressions as digital assets that can be traded in a manner similar to physical commodities like soy beans and oil.
Interesting times are ahead.

Your statement is misleading.  Either you need to acquire Factoids and convert them to Entry Credits, or you need to have a middleman acquire Factoids and convert them to Entry Credits on your behalf.
The only way that I could see a customer not needing to buy Factoids is if they contract directly with Factom for services and Factom converts the Factoids to Entry Credits on their behalf.
If a developer wants to write data to Factom, they have to acquire Bitcoin, trade that Bitcoin for Factoids at an exchange, download and install the Factom Wallet, Factom Wallet GUI, FactomD, and FactomCLI, wait for their computer download data from Factom's servers, generate a Factom address, move the Factoids from the exchange to their Factom Wallet, convert the Factoids to Entry Credits, and take dozens of additional steps to simply write "hello world" to a chain in Factom. It could take you hours.  Just look at the Factom How To Guide:

You're correct in the sense that most blockchains fall somewhere on a spectrum between open and closed.
One of the core design principles behind a blockchain is that it's immutable.  However, a since a closed blockchain is controlled by administrators, you can't be assured that transactions won't be removed or changed.
I've built an engine for recording data in the blockchain called [Tierion] ( While Tierion is technically blockchain agnostic it only makes sense to notarize data in the Bitcoin blockchain because it's the most secure and immutable blockchain in existence.

Here's the post Peter Todd made on Twitter about Chainpoint:
Grab your popcorn and read **all** the comments.
Peter and I have been talking since May 2015 about [Chainpoint](  He was the first person I showed Chainpoint.  Since then, we've shared ideas and had several in person meetings. One of them [included a hug](
Peter's 2012 version of OpenTimeStamps was unimpressive and hadn't been updated in four years.  AFAIK, Peter has removed the original code from Github. Here's an analysis of OpenTimeStamps done by one of our team members on August 19th 2016. 
**Notable shortcomings:**
* 1 transaction per file being timestamped
* Each timestamp produced a UTXO
* We found several bugs and had problems running Peter's code
We've asked Peter several times to help with Chainpoint. He declined. Instead, in [September of 2016]( Peter announced he has spent the past few weeks rewriting his old OpenTimeStamps code from scratch. This new OpenTimeStamps included many of the features we had previously discussed and many in common with Chainpoint.
At this time, Chainpoint was being used by 1,000s and had made some progress towards W3C standardization.  It was disappointing to see Peter rushing to create a competing technology, but we didn't complain. It was disappointing that Peter didn't say anything about Chainpoint in his OpenTimeStamps announcement, but we didn't complain.  It was disappointing when a presentation about OpenTimeStamps vs Chainpoint was given at Scaling Bitcoin in Milan which contained several mistakes.  We were never contacted about the presentation. But we didn't complain. When Peter came on Twitter this Saturday morning to complain about Chainpoint, I decided to respond.
Here's just one of several spreadsheets I have about Bitcoin anchoring/timestamping services.
All of these services as well as [Guardtime]( [Surety]( [Stampery]( and hundreds of other companies overlap with Chainpoint and the new OpenTimeStamps.
Peter's claims about not being given credit seem disingenuous. We've always [given credit]( to the people that contributed to Chainpoint.  We've already told Peter that [he and everyone else that contributed to Chainpoint or inspired our work will get credited]( when we make an announcement about Chainpoint 3.0. Getting credit is very important to Peter and we want to make sure Peter doesn't feel left behind.
Peter is known as one of the most divisive and controversial figures in Bitcoin. He's also an expert troll. His trolling skills might be better than his software development skills; which is quite a claim considering he's an excellent software developer. Arguing with Peter is a waste of time. I'll try to keep future public arguments to a minimum.
I have nothing but respect for the other developers that helped build the new OpenTimeStamps.  It was nice to meet Ricardo Cassata in person at a recent Stanford crypto conference.  You're always welcome to make contributions to Chainpoint, and I look forward to collaborating as we move toward an open standard.  I hope Peter will make an effort to work better with others and be less adversarial.

@_date: 2016-09-15 19:12:22
That's a very Peter Todd response ;)
Let me clarify a few things that Peter may not understand about Chainpoint.
Contrary to Peter's claims, Chainpoint supports generating proofs that use multiple operations with multiple hashing algorithms.  This is one of the advantages of JSON-LD. In OpenTimeStamps, each .OTS file acts kinda like a log file containing multiple operations.  Similarly, it's possible to construct a JSON-LD document that contains multiple Chainpoint proofs, each using a different hash type and anchoring into multiple sources.
Verifying a Chainpoint receipt is not harder than verifying an OpenTimeStamps timestamp.  Chainpoint was designed to support anchoring data into multiple sources - including non-blockchain sources.  We currently support publishing data to Bitcoin via OP_Return and Ethereum.  At the MIT conference, Peter and I talked about anchoring data in a way that links to Bitcoin's block headers. This is something that's actively under development and didn't quite make our August 15th release of Chainpoint 2.0. We're careful about adding support for new anchoring types because many companies are using Chainpoint and we strive to keep our validation tools up to date.
Regarding Hash Calendars: There is nothing stopping anyone from implementing a hash calendar that outputs Chainpoint proofs. This is a standard practice with several companies including Tierion.  A partial proof_path is generated, the merkle_root is sent to an aggregator service, and the proof_path is appended after the tree has been anchored.  Not everyone wants this, so we didn't bake it into the Chainpoint protocol.
Chainpoint uses JSON-LD, which can be serialized using MsgPack or CBOR.  Both produce about a 20% savings in memory.  Most Chainpoint proofs are 1-2k so this isn't really a practical concern.
I don't see much that can be done with OpenTimeStamps that could not also be done using Chainpoint.

Chainpoint co-author and [Tierion]( Founder here. Peter and I have talked about [Chainpoint]( and OpenTimeStamps on several occasions over the past year; most recently at the W3C Blockchains And The Web conference at MIT.
With Chainpoint, we've created a standard for generating proofs that anchor into multiple blockchains and can be independently verified without relying on a trusted third party.
* JSON-LD
* Support for all major SHA algorithms
* Anchoring into multiple blockchains/sources
* Standards for constructing Merkle Trees
We don't describe any architectural decisions for aggregators, hash calendars, etc.  Developers are free to implement their own design for generating and validating proofs. 
* 
* 
With Peter's recent update to OpenTimeStamps, he's describing an overall architecture for generating proofs that is similar to the infrastructure described by Guardtime in their [KSI whitepaper] (
We designed Chainpoint to be flexible.  I suspect that someone running OpenTimeStamps could output Chainpoint formatted proofs.

Factom is not designed to be a datastore for files. It's a way for developers to create their own chains that are anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain. Think of Factom as Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) just as Firebase is Database as a service (DBaaS).
The false narrative that Factom is an expensive datastore is being propagated by Jimmy Song from Liberty.me as a way to drive traffic to his blog. It astonishes me how people can position themselves as experts about topics that they clearly don't understand. I too will be writing an article about Factom, but I'm waiting till the first version of the software is released before making any sweeping statements.

[Tierion]( might be a good fit for this project.  We're an engine for collecting data and recording it in the blockchain. For every record, we generate a blockchain receipt that can be used to verify its timestamp and contents without relying on a trusted third party. Tierion scales to handle millions of records without bloating the blockchain.
We've developed an open standard for recording data in the blockchain called Chainpoint that's been [getting a lot of attention]( lately.

You bring up a lot of good points. What do you think of what we're doing at [Tierion]( We've created an engine for recording data in the Bitcoin blockchain. Each record gets a blockchain receipt that can be used to verify its contents and timestamp. No altcoin needed.
We're able to record millions of records without bloating the blockchain. We've created an open standard called [Chainpoint]( for recording data in the blockchain and creating blockchain receipts. 
Tierion just launched at the beginning of this month. We won the Coindesk Hackathon by creating an insurance claims processing system that creates an audit trail for the claim process on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-09-19 13:04:40
If you want to store large amounts of data off chain and have a record of the data in the blockchain, then [Tierion]( might be a good solution. We generate a blockchain receipt for every record. Unlike notary services, which are constrained by Bitcoin's seven transaction per second limit, Tierion can record millions of records in the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-09-03 19:58:54
We've used Tierion to archive and create a blockchain receipt for every message sent and received from an email address.  Imagine how the current situation with Hilary Clinton and the IRS would be different if all of their communications were archived and each one could be verified by checking the blockchain.
Imagine if when you submitted an insurance claim you got a blockchain receipt proving the timestamp and contents of your initial claim.  That could come in handy if you have a dispute with the insurance company.
The world is full of software. We're not going to decentralize it overnight. Some things may never be decentralized. [Tierion]( provides a bridge to the blockchain for many apps.  Our goal is to help companies collect and share verifiable data.

If I understand your system correctly, you hash a document and then place that hash in Bitcoin transaction, much like ProofofExistence.com.  In your system, you are limited to the seven transactions per second of the Bitcoin network and each notarization is going to cost you about $.03.
We are not a notary. We help companies collect and share verifiable data.
With Tierion, we have recorded tens of millions of data records in the Bitcoin blockchain. We do it quickly and cost effectively. The process is completely seamless to our customers. If you send us 10,000 records we'll store them and give you 10,000 blockchain receipts.  You can use a feature called Slingshot to automatically send your data along with the blockchain receipt to a URL of your choosing.  You can store the receipts in a centralized datastore or a decentralized datastore.
I think if you take a second look at Tierion and read the [Chainpoint White Paper]( you'll find that we're doing something innovative that hasn't been accomplished by blockchain notary services.
@_date: 2015-09-03 18:51:03
Thanks for taking a look at [Tierion](  Here's how what we do is different.  In your scenario, you're publishing a single hash that represents the entire set of response data. This could be accomplished by putting all the results in an excel spreadsheet and using ProofofExistence.com to notarize the data.  
With Tierion, we're generating a blockchain receipt for every individual record.  So if we get back 5,000 responses, we generate 5,000 blockchain receipts and anchor them into the blockchain with a single transaction. Here's how it works:
* We generate a hash of every record submitted to Tierion.
* We place these hashes into a queue.
* Every ten minutes, we construct a Merkle tree of these hashes, publish the root in a Bitcoin transaction, and generate a blockchain receipt for every item in the tree.
Each blockchain receipt contains all the information needed to verify the timestamp and contents of the record. This allows us to secure millions of records in the blockchain with a single hash. Otherwise we'd be limited to Bitcoin's current seven transaction per second limit.
Blockchain receipts are portable.  Other systems can verify the data by looking up the Merkle Root in OP_Return of a specified bitcoin transaction and using math to validate the receipt. There is no dependency on the system that generates the blockchain receipt.
No altcoin is needed.
We've created a standard protocol called [Chainpoint]( for recording data in the blockchain and generating blockchain receipts. Both Tierion and our friends at [Storj]( (who co-developed the standard) use the Chainpoint protocol to record high volumes of data in the Bitcoin blockchain without bloating the blockchain. We're thrilled about the [early response]( we've gotten from the community and hope other developers will adopt the Chainpoint standard.
TLDR; Tierion is a cloud datastore that generates a blockchain receipt for every individual record.

Disclaimer: I designed the [Factom Explorer]( and played a significant role in the launch of Factom.
That's a big question. Here are a few points:
1) Tierion does not require an altcoin.  Factom does.
2) Tierion is a working product with paying customers. Factom is still in the very early stages of development. There is no user interface and only rudimentary developer tools. 
3) You can sign up for Tierion in 30 seconds. We have an easy to use API and developer documentation. With Factom, you have to install three command line interface programs, exchange Bitcoin for Factoids, convert Factoids to Entry Credits, and then you can use the command line interface to write data to Factom. It's a very complicated experience. They are working on a docker image to make things simpler.
Factom has chosen to create a blockchain that is anchored to the bitcoin blockchain.  If you choose to use Factom, your application will have a dependency on the Factom blockchain. If it fails, your application probably fails. They have also chosen to create an altcoin. If you choose to use Factom, you will always need to acquire Factoids to write additional data to a Factom chain.
With Tierion, we've created a [scalable protocol]( for recording data in the bitcoin blockchain and generating blockchain receipts. These receipts are portable. You can store them wherever you like. You can also share them with other applications that can independently verify the receipt.
Factom is still in the very early stages of development.  They just reached their first milestone required to receive their [first payment from the Factoid crowdsale](  The second milestone requires Factom to build a storefront and a consensus mechanism for eight federated servers.  This will likely take several months.  The third milestone requires moving away from the current centralized model to a decentralized model.  This will likely take several additional months.
I hope anyone who has been looking at Factom gives [Tierion]( a try. I think you'll prefer our developer experience and you won't miss the reliance on an altcoin.

Here are three clear and simple reasons why Factom is useful to software developers:
1) The Bitcoin network can currently handle seven transactions per second. While this is sufficient for the current volume of financial transactions, it's far too slow for the world's software applications to secure their data in the blockchain. Factom can write entries at a much faster rate. If you care about blockchain bloat and the scalability of bitcoin, then you should learn more about Factom.
2) Each Bitcoin transaction can store up to 40 bytes of data in OP_RETURN. That's 1/5th of a tweet. Each entry in Factom allows you to store approximately 1000 bytes of data, which is roughly a page of text. Data can span multiple entries. If you need to secure data that exceeds a few kilobytes, you can hash the data and store your hash in Factom.
3) The average Bitcoin transaction has a 3.5 cent transaction fee.  Storing high volumes of data very expensive. Factom entries are estimated to cost 1/10th of a cent, which is 35 times cheaper.
Every ten minutes, Factom hashes the data of all recent entries and stores this hash in the Bitcoin blockchain.  This gives entries in Factom the same security as data stored in a Bitcoin transaction.
Like Bitcoin, Factom entries are stored in a network of computers that are distributed across the Internet.  Once you write data to Factom, it becomes part of a permanent record that runs independently of any business or government.
If you're interested in Factom, you can download the whitepaper or checkout the source code on Github.  Both links are at the top of

I understand now. I wasn't sure if you were talking about Tierion, or about the project with Philips.
People often ask me if courts recognize the blockchain as legal evidence. Here's the best answer I have. Lawyers subpoena computer evidence every day. Oftentimes a person has to sign an affidavit attesting to the state of a database record or a digital document. Lawyers also have to use expert witnesses to explain digital evidence to a judge or jury. The use of the blockchain is no different. BTW, I don't see using the blockchain for proof of legal evidence as a killer app. Jurisdictions vary, so there's no one right answer.
The blockchain provides a timestamp and a checksum. Alice can verify data from Bob by reference to the bitcoin blockchain. This is true even if Alice loses or destroys her data. We're still in the very early days of building blockchain based application infrastructure.

You both might be right. 
Bitcoin and Napster are similar because they are both P2P technologies that were/are disruptive to incumbent industries.
Here's the key difference. Napster had a centralized collection of directory servers that kept track of all the files in the Napster network. You could shut down Napster by shutting down these servers. Bitcoin has no single point of failure. Time has shown that it's very resilient to attacks.
There's a real possibility that mainstream consumers may adopt services that use Bitcoin, but the user is never aware that Bitcoin is on the backend. For example, millions of people could use Circle wallets and simply "pay with Circle".

Technically astute readers will know that anyone who needs to secure large amounts of data in the blockchain will simply hash the data an publish the hash.  I wanted to keep the article appropriate for a mainstream audience, so I didn't get into the mechanics of hashing.
That said, each Factom entry can store 25x the data of a bitcoin transaction, and the cost to write to Factom is likely to be substantially cheaper than the cost to write to the Bitcoin blockchain.

Take a look at [Tierion]( We've built an engine for recording data in the blockchain. Yesterday we announced that we completed a project with Philips. It's the first time a major healthcare company has launched a blockchain project. 
Tierion is a cloud database that generates a blockchain receipt for each record. Blockchain receipts allow different parties can verify the content and timestamp of any record.

I respectfully disagree. I played a significant role in the Factom crowdsale and have and insider view into several others. Every company that has run a crowdsale is struggling. Factoids are down 90% since going live on Poloniex. Ethereum is having issues with their finances. I hope my friends at Augur fare better.
Here's the core problem (in my view). Crowdfunding perverts incentives. It's like having an IPO before building your product or getting your first customer. 
To pump up interest in the sale, companies are deploying affiliate marketing programs under the guise of appointing people as "advisors" or "community leaders". This is illegal for regulated securities.
Raising additional capital is difficult because early investors don't want their coins diluted.
I would NEVER advocate a company use an altcoin as a funding mechanism. In my view, the idea is fundamentally flawed and possibly illegal in the U.S.

Congrats to all the winners! I was one of the judges. Most teams worked with Ethereum. A solution based on IBM's Bluemix was the winner. Only two teams used Bitcoin with their project. Those same two teams used [Tierion]( in their project as well.
Many of us judges had deeply divided opinions about the scores that each project deserved. Several seemed to care a little too much that a team that used their platform was selected as a winner.
I think I ruffled a little feathers by asking some sensible questions and showing a bit of skepticism towards the entries. For example, one group wanted to do voting on Ethereum. I pointed out that at a generous 20tx per second it would take 100% of the Ethereum network's capacity for almost three days to record 5,000,000 votes. Many of the entries ignored real world constraints.

I understand where you're coming from. Bitcoin was designed to be a P2P electronic cash system.
However, the Bitcoin network, protocol, and blockchain can be used for more than currency. Once upon a time, the Internet was used more for email than web browsing. We didn't wait to perfect email before using the Internet for other applications. The analogy isn't perfect, but I hope you understand what I'm trying to say.
The use of Bitcoin as a platform for a variety of technological innovations will make your coins more valuable.

Someone has to say this:
1) Developers don't value design. Sadly, many think that it's something trivial that's added on top of their work - like adding a new coat of paint and some artwork to brighten up a room.
2) Developers have a hard time understanding users. They're so focused on the underlying code that they have difficulty thinking how users will perceive their product. 
3) Making things simple for users often makes the backend more complicated. Developers don't want to make their life more difficult to implement what they view as a minor improvement to their application.
4) Many designers suck at design. They wrongly view themselves as artists. They don't learn how to code, can't understand the problems of developers, and often produce designs that have no regard for the constraints of the underlying technology.
5) Very few managers are both designers and developers. They are unable to provide the leadership needed to bring both teams together. They often create a culture where one aspect of a project dominates the other and breeds conflict.
This is my perspective based on nearly twenty years of designing, building, and marketing software products.

We need derivatives to help stabilize the price. This would allow miners to hedge their positions and hold Bitcoin instead of selling to cover their mining costs.
We need new technologies that sit on top of the Bitcoin blockchain that enable software developers to create new products and services. Think back to the early days of the web. Developers needed to create the tech stack necessary to build sophisticated web sites before they could create Amazon, Google, eBay, etc.  By my estimate, we're about one year away from having a decent set of tools for developers. Checkout Factom, Storj, Ethereum, and Maidsafe if you want to learn more.
Consumers need a way to spend Bitcoin without becoming Bitcoin converts. Nobody started using the web because they saw the value of the HTTP protocol. Perhaps a mobile payments company will find a way to drive demand for Bitcoin by creating an app like Venmo that uses Bitcoin on the backend.
Lastly, there is no one thing that will drive up the price of Bitcoin.  Just like the rise of the web, mobile phones, social media, electric power, telegraph, horseless carriage, and every other innovation in history, the rise of Bitcoin will require a confluence of many factors.

You're right. In a sense, Bitcoin acts like an index fund for all Bitcoin companies.  However, buying Bitcoin is way outside the typical investment profile of VCs, and to a lesser degree, hedge funds.
Do you recall politicians blaming speculators for the rising price of oil? Some investors were brought in to testify before Congress. If any VC started driving up the price of Bitcoin by purchasing big large amounts of "magic internet money", you can bet that it wouldn't be long before they were brought before Congress as well. 
The risk isn't financial, its political.

In many cases, we don't need to pitch them.  We've created a platform that developers can sign up for in 30 seconds and start building applications that record data in the bitcoin blockchain.
Philips signed up for an account, created a prototype in two days, and showed it to us. This lead to a larger project that was completed jointly by teams at Tierion and Philips in a few weeks.
We jokingly refer to our model as Blockchain as a Service.  ;)
I have spent many hours speaking with large companies. Most of them are exploring "blockchain technology" without any clear idea what it can do or what problems blockchains are  suited to address. Many are enamored with the idea of building their own blockchains. We show them how to use the Tierion API with their existing applications to create an immutable record of any transaction, file, image, etc. They can also create audit trails for any business process.
We're looking forward to seeing what developers do with Tierion. For example, I would love to see someone build a mobile app that uses the Tierion API to create a blockchain receipt for any photo. You could use it to take pictures of a signed contract, evidence at a crime scene, or photos of a car accident.
It's an exciting time.

Here are several reasons why someone would want to use Storj:
1) Every file is encrypted and broken up into many pieces before being stored in the cloud. This means that even if your data gets stolen, the thief still can't make sense of it.
2) If you contribute hard drive space on your machine you can get cloud storage for free.
3) Based on my early testing, Storj is considerably faster than Dropbox or Google Drive.
4) Storj can probably provide a cheaper and faster caching service than Akamai.

Marc also invented the web browser, started Netscape, and pioneered cloud computing. 
He hits the nail on the head in this interview. VCs and hedge funds get tremendous scrutiny from regulators. This makes them highly adverse to certain types of risk. No fund manager is going to risk his whole portfolio to make a bet on Bitcoin. Instead, they will invest in Bitcoin companies and wait on the sidelines while the regulators fight over which regulator has authority over Bitcoin.

Thanks! We try and make our tools as developer friendly as possible.  Let us know if you have suggestions on how we can make Tierion better.
We thought it was important that customers be able to independently verify data. And we wanted those proofs to be shareable with other applications. Forcing customers to depend on another blockchain or altcoin seemed like a bad idea, so we came up with the idea of a blockchain receipt.

If you're a software developer and you want to secure your data in the Bitcoin blockchain, you run into three problems: 
1) Speed - Bitcoin can only support seven transactions per second.
2) Cost - It currently costs about $.03 to store data in a Bitcoin transaction.
3) Blockchain Bloat - many in the Bitcoin community don't want people storing application data in the Blockchain.
Factom allows developers to secure their data in the Bitcoin blockchain without having to deal with these problems.  It supports much higher transaction volume, transactions cost a fraction of a penny, and you don't have to worry about polluting the blockchain with a bunch of crap.

Tierion founder here. 
If you want to record data in the Bitcoin blockchain, you're constrained by three things:
* Bitcoin can only handle seven transactions per second
* You can store 80 bytes in each transaction
* Each transaction costs $.03
It's quite possibly the world's worst datastore. The one place where the blockchain shines is its immutability. Tierion lets you record millions of records in the blockchain. For each record, we generate a blockchain receipt that can be used to verify its content and timestamp.
We've created an open protocol called Chainpoint:
