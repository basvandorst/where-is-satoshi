Yes, I do think it is rather obvious. That's literally what I'm saying. ztsmart said it is perfect money, and I disagreed. You're arguing my position against me.

How do our views of Bitcoin differ? You see it more as currency and I see it as trading commodity?

Why do you assume that I "don't know too much about what money actually is?" It's a medium for trade, a store of value, and a unit measurement. I've taken economics classes. And I do understand what Bitcoin is.

I didn't say more prone to be volatile, I said volatile. If it's highly volatile in its current stage of existence as you admitted, it does not currently serve as perfect money. Mind you, I do support the idea of Bitcoin. Playing a bit of devil's advocate here.
I have studied some economics. Why does everybody keep saying I need to study and that I don't understand money? Lmao. I asked a question about the risk/reward of investing in a volatile virtual currency.

Relatively newbish question: if I currently don't have any BTC, would it be a smart (although possibly risky) decision to purchase, say, 2 or 3 coins and wait for more rise in value to then resell?

Perhaps it has a good technological system behind it, but doesn't it seem rather volatile to be "perfect money?"

I started writing an explanation but realized it would be easier to tell you to google it.

¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 
if he knew it was a dumb question it would have been easiest for him not to say a thing

true! you just have to decide what you want to do, i make moves in short term with the long term hold as an overarching theme. sometimes you may take losses in short term trades, if you can minimize the losses rather than maximizing you will still come out winning mid term

it wasn't going to go up further man

you might as well just get out at or above where you just bought it and wait for it to go down, you can def get in cheaper
