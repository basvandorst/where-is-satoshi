Hey guys, I'm one of the cofounders of VoS.  I'm sorry you got banned Godarni.  Apparently you sent a nasty PM to Mike?    I don't know the details, but bannings, deletions, and censorship are not cool.  I'm going to get to the bottom of this.

That was just an example of one issue we were having with reporting compliance.  If you listen to the interview with Charlie Shrem, he was arrested at JFK airport for not reporting to FinCEN properly.  He's awaiting trial.

Fair enough.  I'm sorry this happened.  I've also reinstated the post about the selfie policy, and we're working on a formal response about how that is not how we want to do business going forward.

USD balances are here to stay.  We just cannot accept deposits from customers residing in the US.

Your point about California is solid, and we do intend to re-enter the US market state-by-state but must reassess our options and regulatory obligations before doing so.  We're just stepping back for the time being while we see how this all plays out.
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:24:44
Thanks.  We'll be exploring all of our options going forward.

Yes.  The first step has already been completed, which is that anyone who gains access to your account will not see that identity information, including yourself.  This alleviates a big part of the concern of a compromised account also compromising the entire identity of the victim.  Furthermore, as captaincrunchhn posted in r/vos:
"The second step will happen over the next couple weeks, which will be removing all this data from the system entirely after a verification has been done. Before removal, we'll make a hard copy to which we are legally required to have and keep for 7 years. These hard copies will be made an hour before Iron Mountain picks them up to take to their secure location with instructions to securely shred the documents after 7 years, 1 business day."

I'm one of the co-founders and this was just brought to my attention. Sorry you didn't get an official response sooner.  We'll be changing this immediately. There's no reason for our site to be spitting your identity information back out to you.
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:15:08
Exactly.  It's the state-by-state registration requirements that are the big hurdle for us along with myriad other smaller issues.
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:27:39
That was just a small example of how large bureaucracies make it difficult to operate in this sort of regulatory environment.  It wasn't the entire basis of our decision.
@_date: 2014-03-07 14:00:59
Thanks for the suggestion. This is in fact exactly what we plan to do in order to re-enter the US market. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:17:49
Cheques and wires, yes.

It will be returned to you when we receive it so if you can cancel it before then, then thatwould probably be your best bet.

We'll be looking into the implications of allowing coin-to-coin trading in the US.  Thanks.

Mike's usually pretty savvy with this social media stuff.  I think in this case he was reacting a bit badly to the negativity instead of being constructive, but he tells me you've been unbanned.  We're working on addressing this misguided selfie policy.

Hi hivaidsislethal.  Don't worry, we've got you covered.  Check your PM.
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:18:05
We wish it were that simple!
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:21:36
We certainly have consulted with lawyers who told us to stay out of the US market right now, unless we want to spend over $5 million in bonds for each state.
@_date: 2014-03-07 00:23:38
Well trading between cryptocurrencies isn't live yet, but that will certainly be an option with us even if you reside in the US.  For instance, you could purchase BTC through any exchange that is operating in your country, then trade that for Dogecoin or other alt-coins on our site.  That functionality should be live very soon.

VoS_StoleMyMoney, I just emailed you trying to find out if/when you requested a withdrawal before we closed. Looking forward to resolving this issue with you. If what you say about requesting a withdrawal in February is true, then we will absolutely resolve this for you.
We didn't steal anyone's funds.  Of course, we had to set certain parameters around shutting down the business. We gave everyone 4 months to withdraw their funds before the servers went offline -- servers that cost over $4k a month to maintain (staff plus AWS), so we couldn't leave them on perpetually. We emailed every customer, and posted the notification on all the major forums, including Reddit and Coindesk.
We've had a few stragglers like yourself come to us after the closure, and have been working with everyone to resolve any concerns.

I've got 100% feedback on eBay and my account is 15 years old.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:06:46
Fair enough, but there's an element of trust with any exchange.  I can back up my reputation through eBay.

Presumably any substantial balance of BTC would be held in cold storage anyways.

 No, I didn't say what it was for because they didn't ask.  Once they called claiming it was canceled for being suspicious, they seemed VERY interested in what it was for.  But oddly they wouldn't answer any of my questions, saying they weren't at liberty to discuss it.  It was a very strange phone call.  There was some mention of an investigation, but they wouldn't say what was being investigated or why.
