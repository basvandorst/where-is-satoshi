The difficulty of using it. Basically no real life merchants accept it, and getting any in the first place requires an involved registration process. Also, not all online merchants' Bitcoin payment systems work very well. 
The extreme expenditure required to profitably mine bitcoins, and the fact that those investments are only good for a few months. Pools do a good job of mitigating this, but it still seems sub-optimal. 
The fact that most laypeople still think that you can only buy and sell whole bitcoins. 
That I didn't buy in early :)

Well this is shitty for the fiat folks and all, but I fail to see how Bitcoin could actually prevent a similar situation. In this case, people were trusting a company to take and invest their money in ways they didn't have to care about. I.E., take my money and make it 1% bigger everyday, I don't care how. 
The problem is that this requires them having spending authority, and it requires moving coins around to arbitrary wallets. After all, the whole point of investing is that you give someone money to spend and they spend it, eventually paying you back with profits that they make from it. It would be a similar structure with Bitcoin and I don't really know if we could track what all the transfers meant, even if they were done very publicly (the alternative is them having one massive wallet). 
Basically I fail to see how Bitcoin could have protected these people any more.

Hi. 
If you have a friend with a gun, you should go out shooting with them. It's actually a lot of fun. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 03:22:43
I've been thinking about how to put this for a couple days, cuz it's a little hard to describe. Also note that I'm not necessarily representative of gun owners in general; people get into it for a lot of reasons, be it target shooting, self defense, or hunting. 
I personally really enjoy target shooting. First of all, it's a LOT harder that any TV or video game shows. Your hands are shaky, the target is far away, and tiny differences in movement make large differences down range. But, it's something you can easily see improvement in, too. There's a real satisfaction to being able to see yourself getting better at something. 
Also, guns are LOUD. They have a concussive element to them too, something you can feel in your chest when it fires. It's quite visceral, and quite thrilling. It's like playing a song with heavy bass, or beating a drum. There's something very primally appealing about it. 
Honestly, it's an experience that's hard to put into words, but something I would definitely recommend if you get the chance.

Theoretically, yes. The reality (as said in the post) is that you'd be looking at up to a few days to confirm. Two reasons:
1. Different miners have different criteria. Eventually one will include your free transaction. 
2. Transactions involving older bitcoins have higher priority. Eventually the priority of the coins in your transaction increases to be high enough to include.

@_date: 2016-03-30 08:27:09
Agreed. It's well-reasoned and made me think about the issue differently. 
@_date: 2019-03-31 06:58:07
The argument is that this time it's actually different. 
All other times, we have been automating physical tasks. But we've always needed people to run the machines, to do the thinking. Machines are great for single purpose things but a human will always outdo them when flexibility is required. 
The thing is, we're starting to create machines that are *smart*. Smart in a fuzzy way, smart in the way that humans are. Machines that can *feel* their way through solutions and figure out fixes and processes. 
The technology isn't there yet, obviously. But the types of AI that have flourished in the last decade are categorically different than the automation we've had in the past. 
We've always been good at making things that are stronger than us. Faster than us. But now is when we're starting to create things that are smart like us. That's why people are worried. 
@_date: 2019-03-31 08:08:56
The difference IMO is that our computing is finally powerful enough to support neural networks, which get out of many of the traps that AI normally gets into. 
Examples of why I think it's different this time:
1.	Winning at Go. A task we thought was unachievable not even five years previous. It shows that modern NNs are a step above any other form of machine intelligence. 
2.	Self driving cars, another technology that is heavily NN based. 
What I'm talking about is tasks that require simple decision making. Previously, AI was bad at taking in real world data in a way that could be processed by its logic. The level of fuzzy classification that NNs provide dramatically increases the capability of any AI system. 
Moreso than that, though, the level of fuzzy *logic* that NNs provide. Where you can give it a set of inputs and desired outputs and it figures the rest out itself. 
Of course most of these are simple things. The tasks that NNs replace are simple ones. But it's also a situation where you can basically throw more processing power at a NN to get better, more nuanced decision making. And the amount of processing power we have is steadily increasing. 
So as the level of task that a NN can replace slowly increases in complexity, it will slowly also increase the "skill floor" to be an employed adult. At some point we're going to be leaving people behind where there is just no job that's economic for them to do. 
When that time comes, it's better to have planned for it, rather than pretending like it isn't ever going to be a problem. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 17:17:42
That is really, really cool. 
@_date: 2016-12-14 01:45:42
That is a facetious way of presenting an argument. You should have originally stated that you were assuming that nodes would drop out due to increased traffic requirements. Instead you stated that traffic was exponential with block size without providing other supporting ideas. 
As it stands, I don't think that's a valid counterargument. This discussion was *specifically* talking about scaling block size with network capacity. As network capacity increases 10% per year, we were talking about increasing block size at the same rate. Since we're talking about a large system and an *average* miner, it is feasible to assume that the number of miners will at the least stay constant, all else held constant. Some of the slower capacity ones may drop out if they lag behind, but other places will gain proportionally more net capacity and join in. 
Also. For the record. When you're disagreeing with someone, there's no need to be a cunt about it. Treating other people like idiots because they don't agree with you does not actually win arguments, and doesn't make your ideas more valid. 
@_date: 2016-12-13 23:36:26
Take two numbers, *n* and *k*. *n* is the number of people on the network. *k* is the size of each block. 
In a worst case scenario, every member of the network (*n*) must transmit to *n* other members. This means that there are *n* \* *n* transmissions being made in the worst case, so traffic is proportional to *n^2*. 
Every transmission is of size *k*. Which means that, when there are *n^2* transmissions on the network, each will be of size *k*. This leaves us with the end efficiency of *k* \* *n^2*. 
Let's plug in some numbers to make this more concrete. 
Assume *n* is 5,000 people and *k* is 1mb. We will take this as our base case. Data sent is ( 1mb\*5,000^2 ) = 25000000mb, or 25TB of net traffic per block. 
Now, let's double the people on the network. *n* = 10,000 and *k* = 1mb. ( 1mb \* 10,000^2 ) = 100000000mb, or 100TB per block. You'll notice that it has quadrupled even though the people have only doubled. This is an exponential increase. 
Now let us instead double the block size. *n* = 5,000 and *k* = 2mb. ( 2mb \* 5,000^2 ) = 50000000mb, or 50TB. The traffic size has doubled, showing that it is linearly proportional to block size, not exponential. 
QED. 
@_date: 2016-12-14 02:16:46
Here. Let me quote the argument in full. The first statement was:


When asked why that was an issue, you replied:


I claimed that it was *not* exponential, and was in fact linear. After I proved that was in fact the case, you moved the goalposts and claimed:


Nobody was talking about nodes dropping out. They were talking about increased traffic requirements for them. You jumped several steps ahead by ~~assuming~~ *reckoning* that a 10% increase was an exponential increase, and then reckoning that it would lead to nodes dropping out, and then reckoning that nobody would replace them and thus finally concluding that it would cause an exponential traffic increase.
May I reiterate. Nobody was talking about those things, *including you*, until you dropped your bountiful wisdom of "Here : I drew you a graph".
If you want to actually convince people with an argument, you have to, you know, actually make the argument in the first place. Going around asserting false things and being a dick about it works in politics but it doesn't work with math. Show your work next time.
@_date: 2016-12-13 14:16:08
The scaling you're thinking of is exponential with the number of participants. However, scaling with data size remains linear. So a 10% bigger block will only use 10% more data overall. 
@_date: 2016-12-13 23:47:29
It is actually still linear for storage overall. The blocks are still made at the same rate, so a doubling of block size only means that your future blockchain will be twice as big. 
More explicitly, the blockchain size is n\*k, Where n is how many blocks there have been, and k is how big the block size is. Multiplying k by 2 gives us n\*2k, a linear increase.

The device itself provides a randomly hardware generated nonce. So you would need to know that (locked) value to try to replicate the generation method. 
@_date: 2016-09-14 22:55:21
The answer is "no". The device itself randomly generates a 32 bit nonce and appends it to your files to generate the private key. So it's not replicable across devices until you can access that nonce, which you can only do after breaking the tab.

The guy complaining about this doesn't know what he's talking about. 
1. ICANN only manages domain names, not websites or access to them. 
2. ICANN only manages top-level domains, i.e. they just say that ".com" is a valid suffix. Actual web address registration is farmed out to third parties, such as GoDaddy. 
3. Even if they decided to "remove" a website from their roster (which isn't even in their scope of practice), it would be as simple as someone setting up a relay to get around it. DNS rerouting is *trivially* easy. 
4. Even if that wasn't possible, you could easily use a different DNS service, such as Google's. All you need to do is type "8.8.8.8" into the DNS box of your web settings and you are completely isolated from ICANN's decisions. 
This transfer is a formality and these "warnings" are fearmongering. If you want something to actually be worried about look into the NSA/FBI's intentional hamstringing of encryption and device security.

A new nonce is generated each time the device starts up. If it uses a HW RNG, which is totally possible with regular hardware since they need so few bytes, then it's basically impossible for them to know. 
It is also possible that they could have a compromised nonce. But 256kB is nothing to sneeze at. Take a picture of your hand and use it as entropy, then delete the file. That's basically impossible to replicate.

WRT this point in particular, it's worth noting that, by and large, ICANN has done its job so well that it's boring. There are no pressing issues, no controversy. The closest we get to an issue is when an individual country tries to block a website (such as when the U.K. blocked the Pirate Bay's DNS). Because of all this, there hasn't really been a reason to create an alternate DNS root. Perhaps if there was more controversy about it, though, these efforts might have more success. 
Also, if a website does find itself controversial, it's already common enough practice to hide under a country's TLD, for example thepiratebay.se and kat.cr. Just like we have countries who operate as offshore tax havens, I think some countries would be interested in offering a "freer" alternative. 
Otherwise, you make some good points. It's true that things could change for the worse in the future. But, there aren't really indications that it's going to happen in that way. It's just speculation, especially considering ICANN's stable track record. Overall, I think removing the US as the "king" of the Internet is a formality, but long overdue.

But it honestly isn't completely anonymous. You get 5 dollars in cash, you have no idea what path it took to get there. Cameras and records that would track it are rare and impractical. But with bitcoin, *every single step those 5 mBtc took* was recorded, and in the public record. Yes, you can only see the pseudonyms of traders, but by combining transaction metadata with data gleaned from other sources (like NSA-gathered metadata) it could certainly be possible to figure out that a certain wallet belongs to a certain person. 
This is why coin-mixing services (or better yet, getting something like Zerocoin built into the standard) are so important. They are what provide true anonymity. Without them, it's *definitely* possible to track bitcoins.

It also won't change corruption. Remember how bitcoin is anonymous, and stops the government and others from tracking us? Well, that applies to politicians too. We can't make sure that a single person doesn't donate millions of dollars to a certain candidate. They could even make it look like a million people each donated a dollar.

The difficulty number (ie number of leading zeroes) changes on a logarithmic scale. But the way that it translates is that the block time would at most double (before a 51% attack would be more practical).

There's a lot of hate for this article, but it has a point...
SETI and Folding are both beneficial projects that need large amounts of processing power. But we're using far more than we've ever donated to them for bitcoins. And that's early into the game, before we're even sure that bitcoins will succeed. 
Though the article doesn't suggest alternate ideas, it still makes a good point that greed has motivated us far more than altruism to this point. It's a sad thing, really. 
But maybe we could integrate these two things? An altcoin that has problems like folding molecules as the proof-of-work?
