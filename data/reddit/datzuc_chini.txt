[Some other arguments: ](
*Debate about the environmental effects of bitcoin mining has resurfaced following claims by an Australia-based sustainability think tank that bitcoin could eventually consume 60% of annual global electricity production.*
*According to the Long Future Foundation's website, its calculations are based on the assumption that 1 BTC is valued at £1m, the cost of mining this resource is $500,000 and 3,600 bitcoins are produced every day.*
However: 
*one of the issues is that the foundation's calculations assume a daily production of 3,600 bitcoins, but Hudson pointed out that as of next year this would drop to 1,800 and in another five years it would be halved further to 900 bitcoins a day.*

I found this from 
Blockchain as Arbiter. 
As a result, it is possible to conduct transactions off-blockchain without limitations. Transactions can be made off-chain with confidence of on-blockchain enforceability. This is similar to how one makes many legal contracts with others, but one does not go to court every time a contract is made. By making the transactions and scripts parsable, the smart-contract can be enforced on-blockchain. Only in the event of non-cooperation is the court involved – but with the blockchain, the result is deterministic.

One blocksize is currently 1mb. Assuming one full node will take 300GB to save on someone's computer. If we increase to 2mb, then it takes 600 GB to save, and like BCH, it takes 2.4TB to save, upload/download. For an average person, soon enough we wont be able to afford to run a full node. And only centralized industrial companies can, and then centralization is achieved.

U can act as a hub people pay u fees by using your hub, hence, anyone can open a hub for anyone, so its a efficient market and anyone who wants to make unreasonable profits will be priced out. Also, the protocol routes the most efficient way to get payment through so your hub might not be the most efficient route all the time. Cheers.

Wrong. Anyone can contribute on bitcoin codes on github and then codes are peer reviewed and tested before implemented it's a very formal process but it's open source . That is also why fork can happen so easily.

on BCH, it is bigger than 1TB i believe. Bitcoin has only 145 GB currently with 1mb blocksize. 
and yes you understood it correctly. 
and you will have to first down load that entire 145 GB to your computer to run a node, so it drains your internet consumption, and with blocksize increase, some might not have that much bandwidth.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:29:11
not entirely correct. ETF will have a much more significant impact than futures. ETF is a fund that collects money from investors then actually spend the money in the underlying asset, in this case, hodling Bitcoin.

LN provides solid security and privacy, in a way if no one closes an channel, it could be open for a long time (doesn't mean no fees). But as it is a part of blockchain, it needs to be packed into the block and add on the chain to have it on the main chain's timestamp? maybe it's like an annual report if it is comparable. I am trying to explore my own understanding as well, definitely not trying to be the "teacher" here.

I know there is a downside of this if BTC crashes, though your principle is well paid off and you can just sell some to easily achieve that 10x returns. HODL it and keep living your life until you don't need to ever change your BTCs into FIAT no more. It will happen faster than expected.

@_date: 2017-11-15 21:59:39
it will boom. Recession is typically caused by centralized decision making process. And with the fiat currency without gold backing it, recession means less trust in the governing body behind the currency. So it will strength Bitcoin's value proposition of digital gold. So the price will surge in time of recession. Just like the good ol days when gold goes up, and NYSE does down.

The concern is validate assuming there is huge demand in trading volume, if there is huge demand in trading volume, then it makes sense for CME to implement the Future. It's a trade-off. Everything comes with a two-sided story. 
As a clearing system as CME, i do believe they have the necessary infrastructure and resources to facilitate such volume and potentially limit the leverage on it. 
From a different side of view, this could be a strategic delay to allow other clearing system to catch up.

HODL it my friend. HODL it. I am not trolling or joking. You are fortunate enough to have 200 BTCs but this is still at the beginning.  If you can sustain your current life right now, keep it the way it is. 1.8M is a lot but like you said, it's not life changing. Only sell it if you need some money like buying a house but keep the rest.

They are offline cold storage which means they store bitcoins in hardwares away from the internet, it's equivalent to you store your bitcoins in a offline hardware and put it away. Pros: they probably have better securities. Cons: you still don't get the private key, cold storage is not insured, and it has a 48 hours withdraw time wait as a security measure so you can't access your coins immediately. 
So to answer the question how i feel about it, i would say mehh, i wouldn't use it because the only reason i left a large portion on coinbase hot wallets so i can use them asap. To HODL, i put coins on my own online&amp;offline wallets with the private keys in my control.

To be fair, exchange is part of the bitcoin community and we shall hear their voice too and they shall retain the rights of doing what they decide if users agreed to their terms and condition. 
Hard fork from Btrash was not necessarily well proceeded and implemented, although competition boosts the need of innovation, it was harmful to the entire community due to how Btrash was carried out and the value of centralisation behind it shakes the foundation of why bitcoin exists. Like retail investors, exchanges also have a lot to lose. 
So this is their way to give a fair warning to future dangerous hard forks that exchanges also have a play here and think twice before announcing a hard fork again. This action however will result them taking control and potentially benefit from selling people's Btrash , it's a trade-off.

with a 14% interest rate. You will be paying 3.46% on the money you borrow from the bank if you pay it all back at the end of Feb 2018. Since you will only be paying $600 back per month, so that will cost you $150 - 200 on $2000 - 3000 loan. If bitcoin has a 5 - 10% gain, you will just about to be breakeven. In my opining, Bitcoin should have that gain and even more but you will be 10% behind everyone else from the start. So it's really your call. If you get in later, you might be 30% behind due to bitcoin price increase. No one can predict the future so it's your own risk tolerance, and your cash flow is a big part of the consideration. 
The good thing is that you will have a consistent 600 coming in going forward, so you could take the risk. The risk is not significant based on your future cash flow but also should still be considered. If your 600 dollars incoming cash flow is not stable, then you should NOT consider this at all.  
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:49:13

I think it's fair to keep a large amount of BTC on exchange if you are actively trading. I keep a large portion on Coinbase and tbh, i feel it's safer there than on a piece of paper (not getting paid here to promote Coinbase). But all in all, yes, HODLing in a private cold storage is highly recommended. 
I hope you get access to your coins asap.
