from what I get, except if you have a lot of transactions between two parties, those channels don't really solve anything. So you would need one party sitting between many people doing micro-payments, and the companies providing the bought services.

That's what I have a hard time predicting: when the reward is no longer the incentive, will the fees go down due to volume, or up to make up for the 'lost' reward

You are right, but Change tip is "acting as" a bank. I don't say it's necessarily a bad thing that 3rd parties rely on the blockchain to do that, but I thought I had missed something when Nakamoto stated that Bitcoin could solve the micro-payment problem.

You miss the point. The people he refers to are kept out of the banking system AGAINST their will, not because they want to remain anonymous. So if he wants to help them, anonymity won't cut it. He's not being negative, just saying that it's not important to the people he's trying to help right now.

Interesting, I didn't know about micro-transaction channels. So if I get it right: there would be a micro-channel between Micro-soft (ha) and me, and between Micro-soft and every provider of service?
It's the only way I see it working, because I don't see every provider out there trusting Micro-soft with a "pay after a certain threshold" deal, and I don't see Micro-soft "pre-paying the services and taking the risk of holding 'stock' of those services until the pre-paid amount has been spent by Micro-soft customers".

or with bitcoins
oh wait...

Sidechains seem to be a promising solution. If I get it right, BTC is the gold-standard, and sidechains are based off of it, but with some lee-way to operate on their own?
Do you have something good to read about it? Apparently the current protocol doesn't really allow for it.

He wrote "Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible." It's in the forum post, not the paper.

That actually sounds like a good idea. Another problem though is that small transactions are "bigger" in size, so make for fewer blocks

how so?

think twice when someone approaches you with an offer to buy your coins way above the market rate...
also: cash.
or: send 23 cents on his (alleged) account and ask him how much he received. if he doesn't reply "23", then it's not his account, and you should stop the transaction.
