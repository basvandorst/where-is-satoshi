I'm not entirely sure what our management thinks of it, other than they said this is something to keep an eye on. That's when I said I was available to discuss it.
Between co-workers though it varies.  Some think it's a scam, others think it's intriguing.  Most people haven't been talking about it, and I doubt many people looked into it when they were made aware of it.

I'm not sure how technical I'll need to get, but I don't believe it will be exceedingly technical.
If I can explain the first two portions of this document in an easy to understand manner do you believe that will suffice?
Edit: I guess picking stuff out from here might be better: 
I do have a good understanding, it's the explaining really technical stuff in real time that I'll need to be confident about.

Thank you for this wonderful advice.  This is excellent for anyone in a similar situation, and doesn't only apply to bitcoin!

I like the idea of buying something small online.  Then I can maybe say, that could have been one of our merchants, or some such

It doesn't look like BitPay has test accounts?  It says you need to do real transactions, which would involve setting up a real merchant account.


Not yet. For testing, use real bitcoins but send small amounts like 0.01 USD. The minimum transaction is 0.0001 BTC."
If they'll allow it, I will do a demo though for sure. Transferring money between wallets.  I'll show me doing a transaction at an exchange if they seem interested.
Thank you for the additional ideas!

Thanks you! =)

Awesome, that's good to hear!  Thank you =)

I agree.  Theft is a real issue, but identity theft is not possible with Bitcoin.
For identity theft to work, they need more than just your name and address.  That's often publicly available anyway.

Every time I hear about integrating with another bank I cringe.  I get it, it's good for business, but talk about a LOT of work.  
From comments I hear when I discuss what we do with friends and family, many people don't understand how much work goes into dealing with the banks and credit card companies.

I'll keep that in mind, public ledger sounds like an easier way to discuss it.  If they ask for more details then I can go deeper.

Great idea!  Thank you!  To summarize and add
* No need to find a card. If they're at the computer they have their wallet. *and in some cases even their phone.
* No risk of identity theft.
* Indisputable record of payment on the blockchain (might be too technical?)
* Ability for Merchant to sell smaller cost items without losing money on sale. (micro transactions)
* Immediate transaction.  No waiting for a credit card statement.
* No declined transactions

I'll most definitely reply afterwards with the general sentiment and what I can!  And thank you!

I sometimes wonder if even with Bitcoin this might still be enforced at some companies. They may want to still maintain tracking for other regulatory purposes and thus require it.  Or even their own analytics.
Granted unless something is being physically shipped, you can enter fake info.
