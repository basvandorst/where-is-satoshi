With those restrictions in place, how are they going to buy bitcoins? The only ones they can actually pay with domestic money transfers would be other Greeks, but they'd be in the same situation and have no reason to sell, at least not for a reasonable price.

Google has the advantage of scale, which vastly increases their efficiency. Cooling one data center instead of a billion individual devices, purchasing power in large amounts from a nearby source instead of paying for residential electricity, fast internal communication thanks to having many servers in one place, being able to select a geographically advantageous location, and so on. Your PC can't compete with Google on price.
It's the same reason why cloud computing is so popular and cheaper than purchasing and maintaining your own hardware, scale reduces cost.

If the bitcoins generated by a slower chip are valuable enough to pay for more powerful cloud processing, why wouldn't the cloud provider just use their cloud to mine even more bitcoins for themselves?

A perfectly valid counterpoint to your apparent argument of *"Investments were made, therefore 21.co is not a bad investment"*.

That's not a technical limitation, though, it's an intentional choice for the sake of the customer.
Banks using crypto currencies wouldn't change anything about this, they'd still contractually oblige merchants to reimburse them for chargebacks.

Maybe, maybe not. But that's a completely different argument altogether.

That could be a form of gaming in itself, though. There's a perverse incentive to reject and discourage outside contributions in order to keep a bigger piece of the cake for yourself.

All major browsers have phishing/malware lists. Google's list is even publicly accessible, see the safe browsing API.
You're really reinventing the wheel here. Well, not really "inventing" since you're not actually, you know, doing anything other than asking for money. (Which is somewhat ironic for a supposed anti-scam project)
Apart from making a snazzy website hailing the nonexistent features of your nonexistent software, have you actually put any thought into this? Why do you believe you can do a better job at this than Google with all their resources? How are you handling false reports? Who controls the information, and how is anti-competitive abuse prevented? How do you preserve user privacy?
