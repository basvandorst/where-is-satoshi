I just have to say I feel smarter simply reading this conversation. Thank you all for your contributions. It is an incredible era we living in and we should be looking toward the future with an equal mix of fear and loathing, and hope and love. One thing we know for certain is that some among us are not as they seem and will stop at nothing to destroy the good among us. I feel like those writing this are among the good. But just as I know the sun will rise tomorrow there is at least one here who will spoil the proverbial stew by either greed or just plain old fashioned malice. So I guess my point is that when humans are involved you always have to remember that well , there are humans involved. There is always gonna be that clever code writer who leaves a way in because of greed, arrogance, hell mayb4 even doing it in  Robin Hood type of way, with good intent, but in doing so leaves a door open for bad guys so to speak. 
But I deal in the currency of worst case scenarios because sadly I guess that is my perception of the world. To 99.7 % of the ���� who do what they are told to do they probably wont suffer grave  consequences. But that leaves .003 who will. That doesn't matter until your in that .003. People can recover from losing their wealth you can't recover time. If the  world governments , private corporations or just a pissed off employee decided they want to fuck with you they can. You can't account for the crazy in the world. If you piss of Uncle Sam for instance I think we live in an era where they can and will trace evidence of some wrong to your front door. If they can't find evidence they will create evidence that will hold up in court. Through either bribery or extortion people will bend to do what they are told. And judges are not willing to lose their own freedom for the sake of right and wrong. Well thank you all again for this conversation I think it's got so much value. I am writing this on an old Reddit account but now after writing I have to save the post and copy and paste to an anonymous email send to another anonymous email..go to library, and use a guest pass, create a new Reddit and post. I think that is pretty good opsec for the future. There will be some video of me on some server that shows me arriving at the library at a certain time. Video of me at  libraries desk, and video of me sitting at the desk of the computer I am on. But I will first try to go a different pc so that even if they video they have no trail of me on the pc they signed me up on. I dont think this is necessary for the average who doesn't pose a risk to government. I think my willingness to be like Paul Revere has probably already got me on someone's radar. And since I don't live My life in accordance to the standards they would like I need to take extra steps to ensure my freedom for as long as I can. I have always felt that I would be like Mel Gibson in The Patriot when he grabs the flag before it lands on the ground and charges up the hill to lead the battle cry against the British and indeed inspire us to go on and win the Revolutionary War. I don't want to be that guy. I would much more prefer to sit on a porch with a good woman,  a good bourbon, and some of the finest weed ever grown Megs county gold. I don't think my inner man will allow me to sit back if shit goes south, and it surely will. It's just a matter of whether I am alive to be a participant or not. 
I somehow think that we will look back at this time as the moment when we could have made some little change in the software that would make a huge difference in the future of the world...but I think it's really too late to make any meaningful difference in changing the future to one of hope. I almost say that goes back to 60s and 70s when coding came to life. Artificial intelligence hasn't even been accounted for in my piece here but that is going to change everything. We just can't predict how things play out. Ok that is all for now. Thank you and May God bless each of us on the side of righteousness and May he smite those who are opposed.
