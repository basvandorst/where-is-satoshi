I literally got that same fortune in a fortune cookie from a little Chinese food place called The Ocean Buffet here in the town that I live at and I thought the same thing

I myself am going to talk to a tax consultant of some sort this year because I haven't reported anything for the past two years but I'm almost in the same boat that you are and from my understanding when you purchase it you're supposed to get taxed like a sales tax or something like that I'm not really sure but I just want to be thorough so that nothing comes back on me. I directly called the IRS and I try to talk to them about it but they literally told me that they did not know which I thought was pretty hilarious because for an entity that really wants their slice of the pie they sure have the most dis informed people working for them.

I wish you luck brother

 When you say kyc are you referring specifically to identification verification as in your ID card or is using your email alright?

I was under the impression that when you swap one of the digital currencies for another then that is a taxable event. For example if I purchase Bitcoin off of coinbase and I move it to an exchange so that I can obtain an alternative currency that isn't as easily available then by transferring the Bitcoin into that currency it is a taxable event?

I'm reading that the FBI seized roughly one hundred and forty four thousand of them so does that mean that he has the other stashed away somewhere?
@_date: 2019-11-02 22:24:30
The thing about this is that in order to gain the interest you having to essentially have someone else act as a custodian service for your Bitcoin, or that's what I would imagine anyway and if the whole idea is to shy away from the banking system why would we just create a different banking system?
@_date: 2019-10-26 18:38:00
Yeah it's all about when you buy in not what it's currently worth but the growth over the period in which you held
@_date: 2019-10-26 18:36:06
Well I guess that's $25 in Bitcoin lost
@_date: 2019-10-24 00:55:10
Why don't you just trade your current position into usdt and hold it in that until you can pull it out that way it's not fluctuating

I was just about to ask what time frame this chart was on as well because I'm looking at the four hour and it doesn't look that harsh at all

2009 was when the original white paper was introduced right I mean the network wasn't actually up and running until about 2010 from my understanding. I cannot even fathom getting in on it that early.
@_date: 2019-10-23 21:16:52
 Yeah dude, wise beyond your years, when i was ten i was making plywood cinder block ramps for my bicycle in the backyard and binge-watching Nickelodeon.

What wallet is this? What exchange?
@_date: 2019-10-15 18:32:42
You should have maybe put your watermark on it or signed it or something because I feel bad sharing and elsewhere without giving you credit
@_date: 2019-10-23 16:35:36
Everybody is so impatient and they're waiting on the coming rich tomorrow and I'm focused on the long game. I'll just keep accruing and let everyone else continue selling at a loss. My eyes are on 2022, 2023. Idc about anything short term. I suspect that people with a lot of money are manipulating the markets to increase their position. They might shake a lot of weak hands but they're not going to shake mine.
@_date: 2019-10-14 20:37:26
I honestly do not think that it will happen and that we might retrace down to 6500 but if it does happen that's awesome as well I'm in it for the long haul and I would find it very much amusing how accurate this was in the instance it comes into fruition
@_date: 2019-10-26 20:31:56
I'm just poking at you man
@_date: 2019-10-16 03:13:54
Why are you selling it if you haven't made any money off of it and why did you buy it in the first place?
@_date: 2019-10-23 21:25:54
I remember first hearing about Bitcoin back in 2015 or so and I wrote it off because to me it sounded farcical but now that I've been in the space for about 2 and 1/2 years and I've been doing my research I honestly see that it's the future of finance and though that's just my personal opinion I do commend you for being so forward-thinking
@_date: 2019-10-23 21:23:42
At the end of the day I feel like no one has your best interest more than you and right now is the perfect opportunity to secure that for yourself
@_date: 2019-10-29 20:23:14
Historically speaking there is a large Bull Run within five hundred days after the Bitcoin halving who's to say that Litecoins run wont happen for a year and a half from now, who's to say the big btc run won't be until the end of 2021, beginning of 2022?
@_date: 2019-10-23 21:14:48
Do you honestly feel like the government is empowered by the people? Do you think that the government has our best interest?
@_date: 2019-10-24 01:49:27
Oh man, I'm not knocking it,  i just wasn't making these kind of moves that early. I could have accomplished so much more if my head was elsewhere.
@_date: 2019-10-10 07:45:30
Maybe sideways lol
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:18:36
Well of course it's the risk but it's a risk that I'm willing to take and it's something that I believe in. If you look out how much it has grown fundamentally and if you look at all the people that are behind it, if you look at how much adoption has grown in just the few years on a global level and the increase in Bitcoin ATMs being distributed. If you look at government involvement and just kind of follow the money it doesn't look like it's going anywhere. They are opening up a 33,000 acre Bitcoin mining Farm in my home state of Texas. People don't invest that kind of money on something that they think is going to fail.  I believe that everyone just needs to be patient. Granted I am not a financial advisor or an expert Economist or anything but I do put my money where my mouth is. I will say however that my biggest investment is in Iota.

300,000,000 people in the u.s. 1000 a month. Come on now lol maybe once cryptocurrencies become well-established and we have a truly deflationary monetary system but it's currently not practical. I will say however he was the only candidate 100 percent factual during the debates (no lies) i respect that. The world isn't ready for him,  with the president primarily being a scapegoat for Congress i doubt a lot of what he wants wouldn't come to fruition anyway. They'd block his ass left and right. I would give the guy a shot but I'm not about the increasing of government dependency through over the top socialistic ideologies. I'm anti both parties. They are both wings attached to the same cancerous bird.
@_date: 2019-06-01 19:47:01
This isn't really investment advice but I honestly feel like you're going to regret it if you sell it
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:27:16
No I would not go so far as to say that but I guess my question to counter question that would be what would you suggest to prevent that? If cryptocurrencies are the financial reconstruction of the world and everybody has equal opportunity to buy in from the beginning and they willingly choose not to whose fault is it? What do we do about going about redistributing power on an economic level to everybody?
@_date: 2019-10-26 23:54:18
Coinbase, you really should set up a wallet yourself and move anything that you purchased directly to a wallet
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:29:03
Also for the record I fancy myself somewhat of an anarcho-capitalist.
@_date: 2019-10-24 06:04:26
If you bought Bitcoin through cash app you don't really own it it's like buying gold through a bank or something like that and they say yeah you bought the gold but we'll hold on to it for you and you never actually get to hold it. There's a saying in the space that goes if you don't hold the keys you don't own the coins. So if you really want to own Bitcoin you're going to have to get on an exchange and and set up a wallet.
@_date: 2019-10-23 23:20:55
Is that how you see cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2019-10-23 21:41:45
Go to the coinbase website on your browser on your phone instead of using the app and then try to cash out that way that's what I ultimately have to do when I try to send Max funds
@_date: 2019-08-21 19:24:16
If a recession hits and it negatively impacts Bitcoin I am only going to double down and try to get as much as I can. Let's hope.
@_date: 2019-10-24 06:09:52
I don't really care for President Trump but I honestly don't think he's going to get impeached so my bet is on a new ath. Somewhere around 2020 maybe? During the beginning of his second term lol dude is a dipshit but Hillary was shit shit. I don't see any halfway decent democratic candidate either. Fuck the two party system. Ron Paul is the best president we never had.
@_date: 2019-10-23 20:30:06
One of the big appeals to cryptocurrencies in general was taking the power away from the Federal Reserve and putting the power back into the people's hands in terms of control over the monetary system
@_date: 2019-10-19 02:24:42
That's something
@_date: 2019-10-23 21:30:17
Sometimes it does this to me when I'm trying to transfer funds to a wallet and what it essentially means is that you are trying to move everything and not account for the fees that they are going to charge you for moving the money and I have found it easier to do it from the coinbase website off of the browser than using the app
@_date: 2019-10-19 21:06:44
Yeah you want to buy it directly from the manufacturer because I've heard of a lot of people buying them off of eBay or second hand and then having their cryptocurrency stolen. You've really got to be careful out there.
@_date: 2019-10-31 06:21:41
