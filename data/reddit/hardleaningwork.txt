There was one seller who offloaded 5k bitcoins around $90, spiked a run.

Too close to Christmas.

BFL hasn't pushed out any asics, but there are still FPGAs and the Avalon ASICs. Plus there's a TON of new miners from the big pump.

Individual buy/sell amounts. E.g. I would like to see volume between time X and Y broken down by the top 10 individual buy/sells....
In fact I think I'll build that tonight.

Media craze or whatever. I don't have numbers on it, but all I know is that my reward for hashing at the same rate went down an entire order of magnitude once the price started rapidly rising a few weeks back.

That would be a trade secret I imagine. They're not going to give out how exactly their algorithm works to make sure the cars aren't crashing left and right. It is taking them years and years to get it right, but there's no need to patent it because it's so difficult -- and very hard to properly imitate.
Drugs need patents because you can reverse-engineer the chemicals without a huge degree of difficulty. It's not a snap of the fingers, but you get the idea.

No, an enormous "waste of money" would be the total de-valuation of a national fiat currency and loss of power.

Puppet. 
Fucking. Use. Puppet.
And pay for the enterprise agreement.


That may be true, until you have true exponential growth, where as the dev ops time increases linearly. Depends how big you know you have to scale. Using AWS and creating custom scaling solutions DOES take a lot of massaging, no doubt, but once you nail it you click cruise control and smile.

Apparently you ignore currency...

I'm figuratively glued to bitcoinity. I wish I could find this data as well. Let me know if you do!
Edit: to see pure volume you can just use bitcoinity. The bars on the top chart show volume, but not buy &amp; sell volume exclusively, unfortunately.

I'm not qualified to answer this to be fair, but I know enough about public/private key crypto. So long you have your private key, you can access your wallet. Think of it as the key to a car. The public key can be passed around (this is sort of like people looking at your car), but no one else can get in/drive/use your car without the private key.

That isn't exactly true. You forget that they have research labs with massive fabrication facilities that could easily pump out a custom-built ASIC at-cost. Just saying.

It's also not so hard to have extra capacity in-house and ready to rock.

Normal website visitors can't make single satoshi buy and sells. It would very quickly become cost prohibitive to quant trade.
