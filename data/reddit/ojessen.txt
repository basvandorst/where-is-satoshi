The stages of bubbles as mentioned in the FT's article postulate a return of the price to the long term trend level, so it would not be necessary to drop to zero to confirm to the theory. Which of course makes the article's conclusion of bitcoin's death a bit hyperbolic.

FTT applies to transaction of stocks, bonds or financial instruments. To the best of my knowledge bitcoin is neither, from a legal point of view it is a piece of software, so FTT is not applicable.

As the US budget is notoriously in deficit, reaching the debt limit means either not spending what is allocated in the budget (with a majority of these items rather fixed like personell cost, social security and so on), or not servicing existing debt. As far as I remember, even the government shutdowns are usually not enough to stop increases in debt.

If you do not want to rely on regulation, you have to rely on reputation and trust. Trust is only established over a number of successful deals.

Well, since faith is the only thing preserving the value of any currency (faith in the ability to exchange it for something of utility at a later point in time), when this faith is lost because of major exchanges closing with loss of money to investors, it is quite natural that the fx rate would tank.

One problem experienced for example in the 1930s is that deflation in the sense of falling prices for goods lead, if they become the expected result, to decreasing economic activity, as people refrain from consumption and investment, as they expect to buy even cheaper in the future. A more recent example could be the price of PC in the 1990s, were an argument I often heard about buying a new PC was  that people preferred to wait another year, as they would get a more powerful piece at the same price then.

The value of any money is controlled by supply and demand. Demand results from transactions in the economy, basically proportional to the change in GDP. If you keep the amount of currency constant, the value of the currency would rise with the change of GDP (in a growing economcy), leading to the long-term problems associated with deflation. Therefore, the amount of currency in circulation should be flexible and adaptable to the demand for currency, and this is what the current fiat system delivers.

I don't dispute that the 21BC is useful for the purposes you describe. I just don't see the required demand at the current price point. But maybe I overestimate the size of network they need at the current stage to get enough feedback to support further developments, and they use the price to control that size.
@_date: 2015-03-07 09:33:44
I thought long and hard, how to write a similar reply. But Ithink the OP has a point, although in a roundabout way: Although the existance of bitcoin has no influence on the existance of real estate or equity assets, and the utility people derive from it, selling dollars to buy bitcoin changes relative prices - in principle, as the trade in bitcoin has not reached the volume to have an impact on anything else but the currency pair itself. But if it ever were as important as e. g. the CHF, it would gain an influence on the value of other assets as well, as was seen lately when the Swiss central bank decided to lift the currency fix, and CHF increased about 20% against the EUR in an instant, increasing the price of swiss exported goods, decreasing the expected export, and reducing the value of swiss corporations depending on export markets.

You assumed that the chip woul be ubiquitiuously embedded - in which devices? Still, if the network effect is the main value proposition, why would I impede any access to the network up to the point where I have  a sufficiently strong network effect that I have gained a natural monoply in my space, which is the point to monetize on the effect.
The amount of 400 $ is not the point, the point is not to waste on unnecessary expenses. Most weeks my travel expenses will be higher than that, but these are necessary so that I can provide value to our customers.

@_date: 2015-11-21 12:22:25
It was you who brought up the network effect: &gt; People here should be more familiar with the benefits of the network effect.
The network effect essentially states that the utility provided by a product is a function of the size of the network, the larger the network the larger the utility. 
This is why Microsoft Office is the default productivity suite in corporate environments - not necessarily because it provides the greatest value wrt to producing documents, spreadsheets or presentations, but because using MS Office will allow me to share my work with anybody within or outside of my organisation. 
You assumed the 21 chip would at some point become ubiquitous, so clearly there has to be a reason for other vendors to implent this chip, and 21 has to create that reason. One reason could be a strong network effect, similar to facebook being a standard app on every mobile phone. Or like a GPS chip, because so many apps depend on it. 
In any way, for this to become a success, there needs to be a large number of users, and possibly a large number of apps build on the infrastructure developed by 21. To achieve this, they need to attract a lot of people, at this stage early adopters, who will try something new for the appeal of using something new in itself. But I seriously doubt that the appeal of being fresh will be so strong that sufficiently many people will drop 400$ on this. Would you?

The population of all programmers is about 18 mil globally, according to this article. 
(18.5 in 2014 according to this study  )
Assuming that 5% - let alone 25% - (to get roughly 1/5 mil programmers) are working in bitcoin related projects is probably an overstatement. 
Also, if that were the goal of the tutorials to be developed, maybe it would be reasonable to spend more than 200$?

The 21 p2p net works only with the 21 box, not many people have that, and not many are going to drop that money just to find out if it helps them, not even, if they could buy it on a company cc. Compare that to a p2p where everybody can just download the app and get access to it.
From my experience doing Dev work for a consultancy, nobody blinks an eye if you download any open source app to have a look at it. But any cash layout has to be justifiable in the context of supporting a concrete project. If that project were 'explore the utility of the 21 p2p', then it would be no issue. But how many af these projects are there?
