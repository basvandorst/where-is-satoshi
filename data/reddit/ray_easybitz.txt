Andrew is pretty awesome and he is really out to help his neighborhood!
He hasn't gotten a settlement yet, will be a long while so let's help him out!
@_date: 2014-10-29 22:49:02
full disclosure.
I'm Ray. Arthur and I work on easybitz. All began first day of january when we (Artur and I ) signed up our first merchant. 
Been pretty wild from there and we have a few thousand retail merchants worldwide now, guess that makes us a leader. We had a few television appearances but we have been spending our time quietly trying to solve the problems in the space and flesh out the Bitcoin ecosystem.
A BIG problem we noticed was that the bitcoin maps out there have more merchants that DON'T accept bitcoin than those that do. They get so few customers that they stop. So to make Bitcoin "STICK" to the street we built the LIVE map at  
Merchants get bumped to the top of each city each time they get paid. Only way to keep it fresh.Thoughts?
Another big issue is getting more new people into bitcoin so merchants can get more biz! We just signed up two brothers in a food kart on 45th and 3rd ave in Manhattan, now how do we show them Bitcoin is for real?
We appreciate any and all help. Making Bitcoin big in retail small business is the key to it's future... whose with us?
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:23:44
the only thing u would get is the merchants phone  which means u could fake paying for something by sending the sms yourself.
so u could get the cup of joe, but not their coins.
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:17:17
yes, this is accurate, we have been at this for 10 months now so we can admit to this being the truth.
We are building easybitz into a local rewards network to fix this. it is a worldwide pattern. together we can fix it!
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:13:15
Please list yourself on 
we also have an uber simple pos just like square and our zero click system is even easier.
We'll try and send u some customers.
@_date: 2014-12-06 02:56:01
andrew is damn awesome. the guy is 100% real. super gentle soft spoken and a warrior. 
@_date: 2014-12-06 07:08:32
Will talk to him tomorrow. 
I think they dropped any serious charges and hit him with something small.
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:57:52
hope you lighten up on btc a bit. 
most folks only had a beer each. one guy had about $150 worth of whiskey.
great job on the math, accurate otherwise.

We started 9 months ago trying to help retail merchants learn about and accept bitcoin. We got lucky and got a few of them on national Tv. 
The first step is to send them some bitcoin, that shows them more than anything how it works. What we do here is print out these zero click cards/paper wallets and give it to the merchant. They reg via sms and we scan the card and they get an sms telling them how much local cash they got. Works pretty awesome as you can see by the end of this video. 
Now we're signing up nice restaurants all over New York City  and also doing metope bitcoin parties at those bars and restaurants. 
We built easybitz.com first to process transactions but then we had to connect customers and merchants, else the merchants we did signup would stop taking bitcoin because they got so few customers. The map on  updates in realtime and shows merchants getting bumped up to the top each time they accept bitcoin. This is our solution to fix the broken bitcoin retail economy. Our 9 months of experience has shown us this is the way...
We MUST be able to mobilize bitcoiners to support the merchants supporting them.
Action Plan.
1.Get your friends with Bitcoin singed up at  You get bits for every new bit coiner you recruit and bits each time they spend.
2.When you signup as a user you get a referral code which you can send to merchants. When they signup at  you will get bits for signing them up and bits for every transaction they make.
3.Go meet merchants in person, print out a zero click card for them and show them how easy it is to accept bitcoin. Then throw a party at that place and reward the merchant with new customers!
This is what we know works. Any ideas please let us know. email me ray and will be super happy to help anyway we can. Was in Turkey this year and it is one of the most awesome places on earth! EasyBitz now supports 89,000 cities on earth and we will be making it super easy to earn some bits and have a blast doing it!

There are some awesome people here who contribute some awesome stuff.
Yeah we made a video for a nice place that decided to give bitcoin a chance. That is a lot of work and we weren't paid for it. We are doing it because we want to see bitcoin go mainstream. 
We need your help to really make this happen. We're not some ad agency, just two developers from NYC trying to make bitcoin work in retail. I had to learn video editing to do this. Not good at it but we are trying our best and doing whatever it takes to take bitcoin to the brick and mortar world. 
All suggestions are appreciated. If you join the easybitz network you'll know when merchants around you begin accepting bitcoin. That is an awesome start and then the rewards come after.
@_date: 2014-11-16 10:27:54
Africa is a very diverse and varied nation yes. 
We have many merchants there and they range from a ultra sophisticated nubian car dealership to a Somalian farmer using advanced permaculture and solar energy to the other end of the spectrum as well.
Pretty amazing to see them embrace bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-03 17:29:55
We offer phone support for all retail merchants, meaning they can just call us up any time and we'll answer and walk any small business through the whole process.

Happy to help any small business. Welcome to the family.
Also you'll get on our map and be bumped to the top of your city overtime you accept Bitcoin, insuring merchants on our map are fresh and you get fresh business.

Nice spot. We've been there before.
Gey listed on easybitz and we'll send more folks you way. Everyone will see wgen you make a btc sale and you'll get bumped to the top.
We make it super easy with our zero click system. No training necessary.
@_date: 2014-11-11 23:50:47
most merchants who try accepting bitcoin do indeed stop. we have noticed this trend big time. out of our 5000 merchants only half are transacting and that is AMAZINGLY GOOD! 
Our solution is to build a rewards network complete with living map. When merchants accept bitcoin they get bumped up to the top of the map, giving them incentive to accept bitcoin actively. Users are also incentive to signup merchants and recruit others members. They earn bits for everything , including bits back for each time they buy anything with bitcoin.
Services like this, when they catch on will make bitcoin real on the local level and that is where the bitcoin boom will come from, real organic closed circle growth.
@_date: 2014-11-10 18:26:54
check out coinback.io
it makes it super easy for merchants to sell bitcoin with their stock or for goods. they can track their profits easily.
open source. we want this kind of stuff to spread worldwide.

Please reg on easybitz.com to get on the map.
you don't have to use our pos but if u send yourself a few satoshis it will bump u up to the top of the map and let folks know you are active!

We are going to have one of these every week to help drive bitcoin retail adoption. How else are people going to find out about it and go ? We're building a live map and rewards network at  to really connect bitcoin users with bitcoin merchants.
If you want to know when more places in you city begin accepting bitcoin please join at 
you'll get bitcoin rewards every time you spend bitcoin, refer a friend and a huge bonus when you signup a merchant.
We're open to suggestions to. Working together we can make bitcoin mainstream.
@_date: 2014-11-16 10:29:29
Yeah! Bitcoin brings some amazing people together.
People whom you;d never think would be rubbing elbows and having a drink were partying and having a blast. That's my personal favorite thing about bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-11 00:18:31
Would love to help.
We've been doing this in Washington Sq and around the UN for weeks. Really makes people smile!
We're doing a documentary on Bitcoin too. 
Will try and be there to help out.

The MiT Bitcoin Club  is doing awesome work.

with our zero click system no internet is needed only SMS and any dumb phone. The zero click system is being used by 90% of the merchants in our network.
That night the POS app had to be used because of the low light but the zero click system works without internet and works pretty well.
@_date: 2014-11-09 19:20:18
If you are playing at an event, get listed on the map at 
You'll get bumped up to the top of your city every time you accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-16 10:34:03
Yes, we show when they last received a bitcoin transaction on our live map. The map doesn't lie.
We are trying to connect bitcoin users with bitcoin merchants, otherwise merchants just stop accepting bitcoin. We're trying to fix this problem with our rewards network.
@_date: 2014-11-07 18:14:36
Pretty awesome
Get in the map at easybitz and we'll send more folks your way.
@_date: 2014-11-11 23:55:01
check the map on 
merchants are tagged when they last accepted bitcoin so u know if it is fresh or not. We also reward you with bitcoin for signing merchants up.
@_date: 2014-11-16 10:22:18
We built our live map to fix this. We show the last time a merchant accepted bitcoin right on there. Whenever a merchant accepts bitcoin they get bumped to the top. It was our way of making the retail bitcoin scene honest.
As for the title well guys... we tried the "check out this honest way to advertise bitcoin method....... 1 upvote..." we're just trying to work with the system and culture here. Any helps is much appreciated. We're pretty new to this and still learning.

Retail is special and you guys have different needs.
Simplicity and new customers rank as the highest concerns for retail merchants from the 9 months we've spent on the ground with small business.
 &lt;-easiest possible method.
Our pos is super simple and our zero click system is even easier.
 joining takes about 30 seconds and you get on the living map. Overtime you accept Bitcoin you'll bump up to the top of your city.
If you need help just drop us a line. 718 790 3309
We're in the middle of a 24 hr hackathon in Vegas now but we are alway ready to take a call from one of our merchants.

this is the pattern worldwide, which is why we built the Live map on 
it shows when they last accepted bitcoin and ranks them by activity. Give it a try we are going for a public launch soon. merchants also wan to know how many bitcoin users there are so please reg. this is the only way we can make bitcoin stick to the street.

The "Linear Leak"  is the reason the btc price keeps dropping.
It can be fixed by "closing the circle" The best chance for this to happen is on the local level.
We have real power to make this happen and unhook bitcoin from the price of the dollar. Bitcoin's price mimics the us dollar, which is falling hard from 18 trillion inflationary bucks. Difference is the btc price is not backed by a powerful navy.
all in all bitcoin is doing an awesome job! if it really trended the dollar it would be at .000 cents again
@_date: 2014-11-17 03:11:31
you can fix that :)
we give you 10,000 bits for each new friend u bring in and 20,000 bits for each new merchant.
bits back for all purchases. will be tweaking it and upping things as we test the platform.

Didn't know clickbait was a crime around here. sorry about that.
Yeah I apologized before and now that response has been muted so here I am apologizing again. How about we work together to make bitcoin take off instead of being negative.
optimism works.

We ask for an address but you can just put any park in your city. not required unless you want to get listed on the map.
We also have a super simple zero click system which is perfect for artists. video coming soon.

We've been giving it everything we have since January to get merchants in NYC to accept bitcoin.
It's a tough town and we are just two guys who love bitcoin bootstrapping to try and bring things together. No one is paying us to make those videos, we're doing it because we're so stoked that bitcoin is finally catching on in retail!
Yeah I used a pretty catchy title, thought that was the point, you click the link and we fully disclose it was a meetup. Didn't think that was such a bad thing. Sorry for breaking reddit etiquette. 
Not sure why anyone would consider this an ad since we're not selling anything and we don't charge any fees. We just want to be able to buy groceries and a nice meal with bitcoin right on our block. If you guys are cool with that then join us at easybitz.com and let's make it happen!
Next week's meetup will be at a new spot!

@_date: 2014-11-17 02:16:11
We built  to be just that. you see the merchants activity in realtime. still centralized on our servers for now, although we have open sourced out api server and coin selling system. 
We want it to be the 4sq/yelp for bitcoin but with a real living map and community. This is the only way to bring the scene together, as you said.
