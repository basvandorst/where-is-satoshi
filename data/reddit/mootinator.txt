Nothing "creates" scalability. Bottlenecks limit it. Sometimes block size is your bottleneck.

Did you use your bitcoin?
Maybe the recipient did something illegal with it. KYC/AML is actually making bitcoin more useless than credit cards (if you rely on an exchange).

An SPV wallet isn't a node in any sense of the word, no.
Edit: Or paper wallet. Which I could just have in my pocket, if it wasn't a stupid place to keep a paper wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:46:22
Well, even if it's not really likely to be the actual origin of the terms, it's not something I made up. (Selling short meaning selling something you don't have works fine on it's own.) it's still true, generally speaking that one doesn't take a short position and forget about it, because of the theoretically infinite risk in doing so (In reality you'd get a margin call whenever you ran out of credit.) If you take a long position and forget about it you can only lose your initial investment.
@_date: 2016-04-15 03:10:02
The dishonest companies run off with your coins, while the honest ones implement KYC/AML that's at least as bad as/worse than existing financial instruments.
Where are the 'chaotic good' actors? 
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:46:19
A paper wallet is fine if you *just* want to *store* crypto offline. A Trezor/Ledger just gives you a secure way to *use* your coins. The key should be backed up securely somewhere secure anyway, much like a paper wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:41:25
My Trezor doesn't use coinbase. Nor do I have to have an active node to make sure nobody steals from it. What does that have to do with Coinbase?
When there are inevitably more LN nodes than Bitcoin nodes, is that going to be a bad sign for Bitcoin? This is comparing apples to bicycles.
@_date: 2016-04-14 00:05:59
The truly gross part is that they'll even close your if you transact with someone who then sends your coin to a gambling site, because it *might* have been you.

I know you guys like to think devs are just being assholes/scammers by implementing simple changes like adding bitcoin cash before more complex ones like adding segwit or LN but you're wrong.

Weird, I didn't see that straw man there earlier.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:55:22
There isn't nothing wrong with it. LN is just a glimmering hope that "maybe this thing isn't totally useless" at this point.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:27:51

@_date: 2018-01-21 00:06:20
I would think the only point of having a USD pegged token would be to enable more efficient arbitrage than interbank transfers allow.
Times of high volatility increase the demand for arbitrage, thus explaining why they would need to print USDT both when the price is going up rapidly and when it's going down rapidly.

I pointed this out yesterday... If you went back to the original rumour, it was from anonymous sources.
Even then, most of the actual articles yesterday just said their priority was going to be the custody product. Which is what the original rumours said they were going to do first.

I'd go with the ultimate "de facto" (concerning fact) currency. More people recognize that. It really fits well because it's usually contrasted with "de jure" (concerning law). 
It's readily apparent that, while bitcoin isn't a "de jure" currency in many jurisdictions, it is a "de facto" currency.
Calling it the ultimate fiat currency is nonsense, because a fiat currency is by definition a de jure currency.

Dark pool liquidity sounds like it would be something more along the lines of SecondMarket setting themselves up a deal whereby they can buy large blocks of BTC directly from, for instance, Satoshi.

I would say what makes "digital cable" *digital* is the fact that what you're transmitting video encoded as a MPEG2-TS (or whatever new thing they're doing now if anything), not the fact that you're transmitting it across a wire originally designed to carry analog RF signals by using QAM. The digital aspect is the fact the underlying data is represented as a series of discrete numbers as opposed to continuous waveforms.
Anything which can be stored on a hard-drive (eg: the blockchain) or transmitted across an IP based network (transaction broadcasts) is by virtue of that fact alone, digital. What makes a 5 dollar bill *not* digital (even though it refers to a discrete amount of wealth) is that neither of those things are possible.

A visual representation of digital data on a monitor isn't *really* digital anymore, since the data has been converted to lightwaves as opposed to digits, but one might still want to drill down and distinguish between digital signals at the source (eg HDMI) vs analog (VGA) and how the minitor itself interprets them (a CRT display would have to convert a digital signal to an analog video signal at some point, whereas an LCD can set the color value for each pixel directly as instructed in the digital source.)

The market ate through a $9 million dollar sell order at $300. That means that people do believe in the price enough to buy it up at that level and prevent it from falling further. Unless you're putting a lot of weight on the idea the whale was buying up his own order, that's interesting new information both about what the market is willing to bear and in addition, because of that order some traders might assume that at least one source of ongoing downward pressure on the market is gone.

Uh, you're the one saying micro-optimizations are a waste of time.


The only language I use where I'm generally stuck using a crappy floating point implementation without adding more cruft is javascript, so yes this crap pretty much matters exclusively on the UI. If you're trusting the result of calculations being done client-side in your backend you have an entirely different set of problems.

I don't actually think it's realistic to expect the length of time it took a critical mass of people to trust HTTP to send money to be *longer* than how long it should take a critical mass of people to trust a new protocol to BE their money.

It was a very simple statement. Accounting is the primary function of an exchange. It moves money between accounts on demand. It's negligent to have a "separate source of information about what money the company is supposed to have" because you can no longer easily reconcile what you have in the database (money the system thinks you're supposed to have) with what's in the bank account.

Automatically signing a message with a bitcoin private key is asking for trouble. Otherwise you end up with scammers doing this:
"Here just sign this valid bitcoin transaction transferring your coins to me to prove you own this address and I'll let you log into my site."

The problem participating in a "competition" for worthless internet points in exchange for helping people can be gratifying no matter the outcome.
Trying to earn money this way is incredibly annoying, and generally not worth it. You end up with two pretty major problems that drive talented people away:
1. Scope creep customer: These are guys who keep changing the question even though you already solved their problem and won't award the relatively small bounty until their follow-on problems are solved.
2. Wasted time: Why would a skilled person compete against internet randoms for money when such a skilled person could easily find some freelance work that was guaranteed to be paid should they want or need the money for providing assistance?

That's a somewhat flawed way of thinking of it though. Suppose the bitcoin network were reduced to an arms race between "big evil centralized hasher" and "everyone else".
If everyone else is 1 million people running 1GH/s each for a combined total of 1PH/s, and big evil is running a 750TH/s operation, chances are that big evil can't successfully pull off a 51% attack. 99% of those people might never personally find a block, but their aggregate hashrate finding a majority of the blocks keeps the system functioning trustlessly. The important thing is you're increasing the *chance* that some bad actor won't find blocks.

Wrong. The value of the consideration has nothing to do with whether a contract is legal or enforceable. If someone agrees to give you a computer in exchange for a bitcoin, and they don't provide you a computer or you don't provide them a bitcoin one of you is in breech of contract. The value doesn't come into it at all, unless you deliberately mislead someone as to the nature or value of a bitcoin in order to get them to enter the contract. You're better off not mentioning the dollar equivalent value of a bitcoin at all in your contract if you don't have to.

You tried to imply that the "resolution" of the currency had anything to do with whether currency was digital or not. If anything, the concept of "analog" money is what's nonsensical, since the most common moneys all represent discrete measurements of value. 
The point is, everything has to be converted to *some sort of digital representation* before it can be stored on a computer at all. Hence why the word "digital" is really just as apt as "virtual" to describe *any* data which only exists in computers.
Now if I were to actually entertain this pointless semantic argument, I would note that something which could, in practice, be used as an "analog" form of payment would be gold by weight.
"But mootinator," you say. "An ounce of gold is really only divisible into discrete atoms at the highest resolution, so even that can be represented digitally.... I mean, er, analog-ly on a computer."
Okay, then, so your argument then is that 100M discrete values per unit is effectively the same as about 6.02*10^23 /6.9137 values.
Yeah, I don't think so...

Alright, well, from my experience designing and developing internal software for various industries, the numbers people like to be able to have each subsystem produce a ledger of transactions which balances out to zero. I never argued that businesses don't have other expenses, I'm just saying from experience that they like to be able to quickly run a report on their core product which confirms the accounting is consistent as it produces a zero sum ledger.
*Of course* they can throw in money from some other module without recording that in the exchange module, but that seems rather negligent, because you lose the ability to easily determine whether that module is accounting correctly on it's own. It seems to me like this would be especially important to where automated processes are involved and are making millions of transactions. You want to know the instant your ledger for your automated processes don't balance correctly because it means either a bug or exploit has inserted or removed funds from your closed system somewhere. Software is inherently buggy, and you don't want to have to reconcile it's internal data with the rest of your business' activities in order to be able to figure out that it's giving out millions of dollars.
Though from what we know of Gox they apparently weren't following any sort of best practices so it's kind of a moot point isn't it?

2. Doing floating point calculations in a browser. Using javascript. Which doesn't have anything better built-in. To display them to a user. Hence UI.

The primary function of an exchange is to facilitate me moving my fiat into someone else's account in exchange for their BTC into my account. Or the other way around.

It's like cash.

Edit: 
Here's a less intuitive point: I'm more likely to trust a perhaps sketchy looking small business site with a bitcoin purchase. If they're scammers I only lose the small amount I'm willing to do a test spend with. If I start entering my credit card in sketchy looking places I won't be on the hook for more but I'll have to go through the hassle of cancelling/being issued new cards.

I put some thought into implementing this, and I honestly came to the conclusion using something like Ripple would probably be better.
Currently when an organization sells an e-ticket they're just selling you a pretty number and a barcode. If someone buys a ticket, then re-sells it you can't guarantee they won't just rush to the venue before you, or sell the same ticket to multiple people, in which case your ticket is no longer any good. 
If stubhub issues tickets as, colored coins, the 'ticket' output could be passed between 'owner' wallets. The issuer would be able to trace a specific ticket (which might be represented as a single satoshi output) down to it's current owner. To gain entry to the venue, a customer's mobile 'ticket wallet' would simply automatically sign some predetermined message in order to prove it owns the address that ticket currently resides at.
The problem with doing this on the bitcoin blockchain specifically right now is that it would be prohibitively expensive to issue a lot of tickets because of the minimum transaction amounts, and it would be virtually impossible to hide the fact in the ticket wallet that the user was actually using bitcoin behind the scenes (which would be a really nice thing to do for this use case) because moving the ticket around would require transaction fees.
TL;DR: You could pass electronic tickets around after purchase and guarantee only one person has a valid copy at any given time (assuming only one person has the private key for the address the ticket was sent to). Bitcoin would be a great platform for an 'open ticket wallet' type of app, but anti-blockchain spam measures have made it somewhat impractical, so a more centralized approach to re-assigning e-ticket ownership would probably be an easier win for someone wanting to implement something useful.

Not to mention WillyBot started its market order buying pattern less than a week before SR was seized.  
@_date: 2015-01-16 04:24:07
Well, we know Willy bought a lot, and we know the big rally started almost immediately after the Silk Road was shut down.
Why would an API put there in the first place? One would assume primarily for money laundering, but it sounds like (from other comments) SR had some hedging on escrowed funds. Do we know for sure Willy wasn't both buying and selling before the SR was shut down?
Edit: Answer: It apparently wasn't. But Willy started on September 27, and SR was shut down October 2. Less than a week. That suggests that if WillyBot was somehow SR related, it was initiated by someone who knew what was coming. Though that doesn't preclude the Markus/ID 698630 accounts from being money laundering related.

The difficulty is determined by how fast the interval between specific checkpoints is (2016 blocks). It's adjusted to the difficulty that would theoretically would have made the previous 2016 blocks take exactly 2 weeks. So the difficulty is always playing catch up. Lower difficulty could decrease selling pressure from miners covering electricity costs because each remaining active miner will be generating more bitcoin per unit of power used.
I don't think that's the main thing driving the price though.

At the (current) minimum, say a 1 satoshi transaction fee, they'd still be getting a .282 BTC per block reward. Not to mention the market cap would have to be much higher to support 47,000 tx/s. That .282 would likely be worth more than the current 25BTC reward is.

A lot of names of NPCs in World of Warcraft are references to people/places/things in the world. For instance, a cooking trainer named "Guy Fireeye" would be a blatantly obvious reference to Guy Fieri.  
Given their propensity for naming things this way, the "Tinkertoss Twins" is very likely a reference to the Winklevoss twins name at the very least.  
The screenshot of the quest posted is only the Alliance version of the quest. The Horde version involves NPCs named "Mixxy and Trixxy Weldblast" and has the same text involving drilling equipment. If there's any connection between a name similar to "Weldblast" and bitcoin that would strengthen the idea the diggin is a reference to their bitcoin fanaticism via "mining", otherwise the connection seems a bit spurious to me.

Cash isn't good for internet transactions.
Disposable visa cards have some pretty big drawbacks:
1. Very high fees.
2. Disposable credit cards are still pull technology. Handing out a license to withdraw all of the money to anyone you'd like to pay and hoping they don't do it (or having insurance company cover it if they do) is an incredibly daft way of handling payments no matter how you slice it. We only built that method up and got good at it because there wasn't something better around. Now there is.

You're grossly overestimating how much people actually pay attention to things they don't care about here. Most people you think were "exposed" to bitcoin would probably recall hearing of it, and that's about it.
The challenge isn't to get people to notice that bitcoin exists, it's to get them to *care*. That kind of thing, if it happens at all, will take years of exposure to it if not decades before that happens. One at a time people will wake up one day and say "Okay I've been hearing about this bitcoin thing for years and it hasn't gone away yet, maybe I should figure out what it is and whether I need to pay more attention to it."

It's not these people, it's everyone.
People assume honest people, when presented with the same evidence will draw the same conclusions as them, and therefore question the motives and often, on the internet, the veracity of the actual existence of anyone who draws a competing conclusion.
When one side of an argument is shielding itself from dissent through censorship that's a strong indication that it's no longer defending a rational position but has progressed into irrational groupthink.

*In theory* the price movement over the last few days could have happened without *anyone* losing any money. (That's almost certainly *not* the case, but bear with me.)
Suppose someone received 10,000 bitcoins for a pizza then left them alone.
Then suppose the market bids bitcoin up to $1000.
Then pizza guy says, "Gee, I'm sitting on ten million dollars, I should exchange those for US dollars so I can buy hookers and blow."
So he puts his $10m bitcoins as a market order on an exchange. That eats through all the orders down to $900. So now the price is $900, and billions of dollars *appear* to have been lost, even though only one 10 million dollar transaction happened. But nobody lost any money. The guy pushing the market down has realized 9-10 million dollars in gains, and nobody who bought from him on the way down will realize any losses until they sell. Assuming bitcoin eventually goes up, they may not realize any losses.
The aggregate value (or market cap as people like to say around here) is almost totally meaningless, since if everyone simultaneously decided they wanted dollars instead of bitcoins, the aggregate value of bitcoins would instantly become $0.

**Who is going to pay for maintaining that minimum hashrate, and how will they pay?**
The answer is a lot simpler than anyone thinks, actually. By the time the block reward is too small to be an incentive to mine  for profit, *people who own bitcoin* will understand bitcoin better and will have enough incentive to keep their investment secure by mining themselves.
In fact, *any* solution to the future security problem that relies on *miners getting paid enough to profit* is only going to encourage more centralization over the very long term.

Ah, yes, but I still have no idea what you're talking about. Statistical variance, or the fact that miners != everybody.
Because it seems a lot more of everybody support BIP 101 than miners, so that one shouldn't be a problem.
Statistical variance is a normal part of bitcoin.
Fake votes are only a problem if miners stop taking their pills and actually decide they want to destroy bitcoin for no apparent reason...

That theory is bunk. The profit margin of large grocery stores is about in line with credit card fees. Their contract with payment processors state they can't charge more for credit card payments so they're forced to socialize the cost of credit card fees to everyone via prices.
I agree the math is somewhat different for SMBs and higher margin businesses, but it's an undeniable fact that credit cards have made the basics of life a bit more expensive for everyone.

I doubt I can convert anyone, but owning and using some bitcoin may. Try it out. Find somewhere you can get a hold of $20 worth of bitcoins and find a place to spend them.
Being able to nearly instantly transfer *value* to anyone anywhere in the world without any red tape is a very powerful thing.
For me the most useful application right now is saving a few bucks on WoW time cards. A bit niche. Anothher place it has a lot of unrealized potential is for international travel, both as an apolitical money and as a way for family/friends to throw you a quick lifeline if you run into trouble.
That's my two cents on bitcoin.

1. The best way to avoid getting an eviction notice is to tell your landlord why you're going to be late paying. 
2. Even if you do get one, you generally have X number of days to move OR pay. 
3. Canadian currency is legal tender. Therefore, IANAL but I believe that means your landlord can't *not* take it for an outstanding debt, which is what overdue rent is.
This has NOPE written all over it.
@_date: 2015-04-27 14:40:44
Depends on the province. For instance in Ontario they have to wait until the rent is overdue to send an eviction notice at which point the landlord still has to give them 14 days to pay. Sure they can terminate a remtal agreement with more notice (30-60 days) but nobody is going to do that over getting a payment a day late. Especially in the highly unlikely scenario they're insisting on payment in a semi difficult to acquire digital currency.

@_date: 2015-09-14 15:15:56
It is the point. If there were no mining reward in the first place nobody would have had incentive to mine in the first place because nobody would have any bitcoin to protect. The relationship between a shared limited resource and having 'enough' bitcoin miners is not as straightforward as people make it out to be. In the tragedy of the commons it's enough for *a few people* to take TOO MUCH advantage of a shared resource to ruin it for everyone. This is not at all the same. This relies on *a critical mass of everyone* taking advantage such that the system will not be secure. I'm not suggesting that everyone will do their share of mining, I'm suggesting that enough people will have enough psychological incentive to mine that there will be enough security despite free-riders.

It's a usability failure on Circle's behalf for sure.
Correct Path (likely to be used by bitcoin veteran):  
1. Open Circle App  
2. Press Button on main screen that looks like a QR code.  
3. Send correct amount of money

1. Open circle app.  
2. Ignore or simply ignore meaningless QR code symbol.  
3. Enter menu.   
4. Select 'Send Money'  
5. Send wrong amount of money because there's no reference to bitcoin amount or scanning QR codes.  
Edit: There is actually a 'qr' button at the end of the address line in the app, but again, a new user is only going to use that if they know why it's a good idea.

I sent from Mycelium. I had actually emptied my Circle account into my own wallet months prior. I still had a zero balance in Circle when they did this. ~~The meme is incorrect. This is not a solution.~~
Edit: Okay, here's what happened exactly:
Feb 7: Emptied Circle wallet to Mycelium
March 3: Sent 1BTC to Circle from Mycelium and cashed it out.
March 16: Sent some BTC to Bodog.
March 29: E-mail from Circle.
So it looks like I screwed up my 'plausible deniability' by sending BTC back to my Circle account. Though I'm Canadian and it's still a bit like Amazon closing my account because I'd used my own credit card at an online casino. Another case to be aware of, I suppose.

True, but the only high-ish profile case I can think of where that applied recently is [this one](
In this case they decided being charged with murder for killing a drug user was just too unjust.
The 2nd degree murder conviction was reduced to manslaughter on appeal (which is a charge that makes no sense in this case) because the judge told the original jury they would have to either convict of murder or acquit.
The jury effectively decided is that the drug dealer was a horrible person who deserved to die and the murderer was a pretty okay guy by them.
So good luck with the line of thinking that thinks jury nullification will *help* anyone involved in the drug trade anytime soon.
