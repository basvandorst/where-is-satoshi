To be fair, the FIFA issue affected the USA directly, in that they lost their bid to host the event. Mt Gox may have US customers, and I realise the USA is a corporatocracy run by the whims of big business, but Mt Gox was not that big of a deal here. It's collapse, one could argue, was good for the banks - anything to make bitcoin look bad is good for them.
If we were talking of some big named party donors and such like, there may have been a bit more traction. Perhaps a statement on the matter from higher-placed officials. However, the average bitcoin user is not what politicians consider to be a person of any importance. There are other things the USG would prefer to be spending tax dollars on.

Your twisted view of Bitcoin does not tally with that of the original author, who wrote: "It is possible to verify payments without running a full network node."
Evidently, Satoshi does not agree with you.
@_date: 2015-06-28 16:46:52
If one operates an independent block chain solution then that would require open exposure, brining the threat of a 51% attack, unless those involved in the product would provide enough resources to the network, which would necessitate some form of remuneration. Without that reward, the network would be too small and therefore vulnerable to attack.
So now we consider the idea of a closed network that nodes cannot simply join of their own volition. And we are now no longer have the power of distributed systems and are firmly into centralised environments.
To gain the advantages that the bitcoin network provides, one must either utilise bitcoin (the currency) or build several geographically distributed super computer clusters and continue to grow this over time.
It just does not appear realistic or rational to think anyone can build upon the technology (blockchain) without using the very technology (bitcoin) that is frequently dismissed.
@_date: 2015-12-22 14:09:58
You miss the point: **Satoshi expected people not to be running their own full nodes.**
Your comment that "Everyone is the target group and should ideally be able to run their own node under their own physical control." is not in line with Satoshi's vision, it is your desire. Satoshi  envisaged large server farms being the network. People like you are butchering the goals he clearly set out.

Well, source location was not indicated, hence my question. Italy is west of Greece too. If one is embarking from a [Schengen Area]( country it is quite easy to get 10 Bitcoin ATMs into Greece. Even from the [EU28]( it is a simple matter, due to the free movement of goods and services within the EU. However, the OP used a proper noun ([West]( not the common noun (west), indicating a very large area. Kind of like someone saying they're sailing from the northern hemisphere, it's not very helpful in enabling return of serve.
Based upon that alone the OP should give it up since they will stand zero chance of communicating clearly with customs.

Thoroughly agree with the fact that the USG does reach far. Too far, IMO. But there is nothing so far that points at a US court imposing a gag order on Karpeles. There are frequent claims of such, but the simple fact of the matter is that the US is hardly likely to get involved in a bankruptcy case, featuring a Frenchman in Japan and then impose a gag order via a secret court. It's all just too whacky for such a case. If the USG wanted him, they would simply send the Japanese an extradition request. No need to go all FISA on him.

The online gambling market is a bit slow with regards to Bitcoin. As it is with many new ideas. Just look at how slowly it is taking to get everyone offering mobile products!
Bitcoin is a technology that is gaining more interest within online gambling. It's certainly a topic of discussion. For example, there is a conference on in London at the moment called ICE Totally Gaming which has seminars running today and tomorrow on Bitcoin. Our Payments Manager has stated that he will be attending, if he can get away from the stand. At another gaming (gambling) conference in Malta last year there was a seminar covering Bitcoin in the online gambling space. Everyone in the industry (broadly speaking) is very new to this. At the seminar last year, the level of knowledge displayed by the panel was extremely limited...but there is huge interest.
That being said, our CTO declared yesterday morning that "Bitcoin will be dead in five years." I took that bet. One pint to the winner in 2019. Payments manager suggested 1BTC as the wager, but when comes the time to settle that might be too rich for his blood.
Small side note: Reputable gambling sites do not cheat. They do not need to cheat - the house edge is enough. In the end, the house always wins.

I kept twenty-something BTC on Mt Gox for a while. They were there from when I had initially purchases them for a couple hundred notes. Didn't really think much of it at first and just left them in Gox. It was only when the price started going over 1kUSD that I figured BIP38 paper wallets were something I *needed* to sort out.

Perhaps the alleged "Bearwhale" was actually a dinosaur banking establishment that was buying bitcoins away frmo the exchanges at discount rates and selling massively in an attempt to destroy confidence? Perhaps the 30k dump was a last ditch attempt to push the price below the previous ATH? Perhaps with the off-exchange supplies drying up they're now having a harder time getting coins to dump?
If you wanted to subvert the bitcoin movement, how would you do it? Certainly buying all the coins would not work. So you destroy confidence buy getting others to sell. The problem would be controlling the haemorrhaging of cash that would be required to keep such a project rolling.

Not really fair comparison. Cavirtex has very low volume and this can give rise to bigger swings.

You need to understand that with bitcoin payments there is no need for AML/KYC, unless the operator wants to for some reason. This has been because of the payment service providers requiring it. However, if an operator (leave Poker Stars out of this for just a moment) wants to run a gambling site that is bitcoin-only, there is no need for PSPs and no need for AML/KYC.
Moving to Poker Stars (or any other regulated operator) amongst the advantages of using bitcoin for deposits are:
1. No chargebacks. There are a lot of chargebacks in online gambling. Digital cash removes this major PITA.
2. Lower fees. PSPs love to charge high service fees because they can. And so this goes to the operator, or is passed on to the client, who is not happy that they did not receive full credit for what went out of their account.
AML/KYC can still be performed with bitcoin deposits, for those who have a jurisdictional requirement to do so.
Yes, one may argue "but you still need to buy the bitcoin", or "what about slippage". You'd be missing the bigger picture here. But that's okay, stick around and watch this evolution from the bar. Soon enough the beer you're supping on will be charged in bits.

Well done to you. Adoption will take time as businesses become aware of bitcoin. For the moment more and more businesses are accepting bitcoin and this will continue to grow. You can use sites such as [CoinMap]( to find local businesses accepting bitcoin. There are also apps for mobile devices available, such as [Bitcoin Map](
Try to keep in mind that you are an early adopter and it will take some time for the momentum to pick up. Bitcoin is disruptive and there are many who will not want it to succeed. It has traction and businesses do find the benefits in accepting bitcoins, which is why these businesses often offer discounts as an incentive for people to purchase using bitcoin. Ask you local businesses to start accepting bitcoin and show them how, as well as the benefits of doing so.
Oh, and ignore the trolls.

It is well established that charities do not pass on 100% of donations. They do, after all, have operational expenses to cover. However, research into a number of charities has shown that they frequently waste financial donations in unnecessary expenditure.
I would suggest that if someone were to think about donating to a cause, that they research the best method to get resources on the ground, where it is needed, without using middlemen who have to siphon funds off to pay their bosses.
Speak to groups with people on the ground about donating with Bitcoin for whatever your focus is upon.

Yes, it all looks conspirational, but in the light of day we need hard evidence. And the only evidence we really see is that Karpeles is not providing information or the coins themselves. Absence of evidence is (some might say) evidence of absence. Ergo, he has failed to ensure the integrity of the coins he was entrusted to retain on behalf of his clients.

Let's say the drum-beaters who proclaim 1,000,000USD per BTC are correct and the figures reach that high. Having 100USD of BTC today will then only be around 300,000USD at that point in time. I say "only", because you have to consider that these same MIT students are probably thinking that in 5 years they'll be sitting on 300,000,000,000USD in net worth and their free BTC will be insignificant.

I would like to see governments ask their tax-paying public how much they are prepared to voluntarily donate towards such programmes that combat victimless "crimes". the fewer people who are interested in supporting such policies would mean that the remainder would have a higher bill to cover, which, in turn, would result in an even lower number of people willing to part with their earnings.

Objectivity is a rarely observed phenomena on r/Bitcoin. Even more so now. I'm still firmly in the camp that believes in the technology of Bitcoin. Even if there is an exchange that has gone titsup and lost customer funds (yes, I did have some coins in there too) it does not mean that the technology is a failure, only that there was a poor implementation out there.
Bitcoin is not Mt Gox. Bitcoin is far bigger than one service. The fundamental principles that brought me to Bitcoin are still in existence, and I, for one, will continue to proselytise this movement.

You did not provide any satisfactory explanations before the Japanese investigation started. Instead you attempted to deflect attention away by using the excuse of transaction maleability. Either this was a case of incompetence or deceit. Which one? To use the "ongoing investigation" excuse now is just that, an excuse akin to " the cat ate my homework".
I would tell you to grow a pair and come clean. But it is clear you have no intention of doing so. People need to know exactly how much contempt you have for you prospective, current and past clients. Until you can learn honesty with the people who put food on your plate, you should be avoided like a bad case of syphilis.

In the same way, rocking into r/Bitcoin spewing Doge-related nonsense is considered rude.

As much as it sounds like a broken record, Bitcoin is just like cash. And as such, it needs to be protected in a similar way. Our own methods for protecting our cash is typically to put it in bank. Now with Bitcoin users this is not (yet) an option. But we can operate our own "bank" in terms of the security and peace of mind they (are supposed to) provide.
That being said, it will not surprise me if very soon (2014) some bright enterprising person starts a global Bitcoin "bank" service, to provide Bitcoin users with the services they seek.

The LGA are not experts in this area, so any cautious response by them is understandable. To be fair, it is surprising that Vera&amp;John tried this under the Maltese licence, since the LGA does things very much by the numbers and Bitcoin is too new for them right now. This is why the majority of Bitcon-based operators are not looking for a jurisdiction to get licensed in, but instead are putting together their products and getting to market.
I really hope the LGA gets its head around Bitcoin and provides a framework for operators to work under. It's good for the industry and good for Malta.

I would suggest looking deeper into this. Right now, when I look at Bitstamp, I see the first major wall at 467.59 (200 coins) with another huge wall at 470. These walls are obvious attempts at manipulation, this in itself tells us that the movement is not always purely market related. Additionally, just because there are more vendors accepting bitcoin does not translate to customers using bitcoin in their daily purchases.
We will need to see more merchants accepting bitcoin payments in the first instance. The discounts they tend to offer should eventually lead to people explicitly choosing to pay with bitcoin in the future. It's a no-brainer to use bitcoin in these circumstances. As that happens then the price will move north. Right now bitcoin is still far too much of a geek niche to have the general public consider it to be anything other than an Internet craze. Give it time. We're still in the infancy of the technology. 
Too many people looking to get rich quick on the back of a new way of doing things. That's all well and good, but it should not be the focus of where we are going. Look at bitcoin for what it is: a global revolution in how we trade with each other. Take the power back.

I find it very sad when I read this type of comment. No-one knows for sure where Bitcoin will go, but if some of the opinions, such as Rick Falkvinge, are correct then picking up coins at any level below 100,000USD (or even a million USD) should be considered a good move. Just because we are not seeing sub-1USD coins now (and with the benefit of hindsight) does not mean that picking up coins now to sell at 1k USD, 5k USD, 10k USD and so on, is not still able to get on board and ride that boat/train/starship.

* Doug Dreeler sends a package to Ellie Officer. Ellie receives package with franking mark denoting where Doug sent the package from. This is going to be a large geographical area - Doug doesn't put a real return address on the package.
* Ellie orders more packages from Doug, each comes with a different franking mark, but shows a general area of where Doug is shipping from.
* Each area Doug has sent from encompasses XX mailboxes to cover.
* Each mailbox Doug uses is also used by YY other citizens.
* Without violating certain laws (in the USA I believe this is a 4th Amendment right) on searching property it is near impossible to find out which package in XX mailboxes might be containing contraband in a single package that Ellie does not even know what the package looks like yet, or when Doug will mail it.
This is where I see the problem. Ellie has no advance notice of where and when Doug will deposit the package into the mail system.
Hope that's clearer.

So your issue is not actually with Bitcoin, but your poor investment strategies. You bought during an obvious bubble (which we have seen before and will likely see many times again) and when the price corrected you blame anything and everything except yourself for throwing more money into Bitcoin than you could afford to.
I feel little pity for you. You appear to be quite capable of feeling plenty of that for yourself.
Sell at the first opportunity you have. Sell the moment you can recoup your investment. I recall reading similar comments after the April drop of last year.

Grexit that is going to cause a dip in the Euro value, but more that we are expecting the European Central Bank to start printing more money. This round of "quantitative easing" had been rumoured, but the Swiss National Bank's actions last week really gave the boldest signal as to what was about to take place.

Now imagine that your software could only check 2.5 heartbeats per second, and that it cost 1000USD per heartbeat analysed. You could allow the software to run at millions of patients per day, but your Pentium4 and onboard GPU cannot handle the load, so you keep the heatbeat per second rate down artificially "because it's not been tested properly and things might break if we increase the detection rate."
But the software is open source and competitors are building the same software, only slightly differently where it does handle all the patients that wish to use the service and the costs are 2c per day. To come up with an end scenario where the masses do not migrate to greener pastures is delusional. Your premise is that the masses will stay with bitcoin becuase it is bitcoin. There is no logic in that.


The network is still being built by everyone taking part. The market capitalisation is simply a recognition of the potential value in bitcoin, not realised value.
Bitcoin can still fail (who said it has even succeeded yet?) if we do not get a grip on the issues that are real and prominent today. Beyond all the silly moon posts we get on each upswing, bitcoin has been faltering over the past couple of years. The dev community needs to relax and get back to the way they were communicating before 2013/4.

Try adjusting the variable that reflects the amount of available bitcoin in circulation. So many people have lost so much coin over the years that the 21m figure is never going to be realistic.
I am suggesting that the 5.8mUSD figure is correct (please do not put words into my  mouth) but almost every prediction I read is based on 21m coins. This is something that needs to be borne in mind to be able to understand the real potential valuation in the future.

He (is not opposing segwit. He is not supporting segwit. He is agnostic to segwit. It is possible to hold a neutral position on something.
You want him to signal support for something *you* want? Then you need to demonstrate examples of how and why this is going to benefit him. Shouting insults at Roger will not help you to achieve your objectives.
Instead of doing the same thing, over and over, and expecting different results, try engaging in open discussion somewhere where the sticking points on what needs to be achieved and how best to achieve it can be thrashed out.
The collective here provides no reasons for those not supporting segwit to do so. Many of them have legitimate concerns that have not been addressed and are told to shut up when they seek dialogue. When the reactions to their viewpoints or questions is treated with such disdain, you cannot expect the masses to gleefully trot along behind.
It takes no effort to not support something. You want people to support segwit. You need to make the case. If the case has not been made, you need to understand why and deal with that.
And as a final note: Roger is not controlling the remaining 75% of non-signalling hashpower.

You are correct. This rumour came from the Financial Times. No sources quoted, and this was released just before the referendum. This thoroughly stinks of a blatant attempt to manipulate the psyche of the Greek voting public into a panic. Tsipras and his team are trying to get a better deal for the Greeks, not a worse one.
I hope this article is seen for what it is and blows up in the face of those who seek to emasculate Greece. Additionally to that, I hold a faint hope that this is a catalyst towards a free trade Europe and that the political "one size fits all" United States of Europe of German and French politicians' wet dreams come crashing down around them before we enter the phase of having a civil war or full-on police state. Oh, the police state will come. Cast-Iron Dave Cameron already wants to ban encryption and there is no right to remain silent in the UK since the '90s.
Let us not forget that the Cyprus bail-in, where the Eurocrats, ECB and IMF all agreed to rob the Cypriot bank accounts of their cash to fund...the banks. It's not going to be Tsipras and his team who rob the Greeks, it will be the very people who have taken from Greece and continue to demand more. It rattles my cage that these unfounded rumours are going around proclaiming the end of the world if Greece votes NO tomorrow, when in fact, if they vote YES it will be the case that bank accounts are raided.
Come on, Greece! Stand up for your people and your nation. Tell the bankers to go fuck themselves.

If bitcoin was worth pennies, the network would be much smaller and more vulnerable to attack. People are burning insane amounts of electricity to get their hands on bitcoins.

I'm guessing that HSBC tends to charge more than 0.5% for its money laundering services. They made a lot of money from this criminal activity, and some might say that in doing this business with the drug cartels that HSBC literally got away with murder.

People who want to play dollar tables will seek them. Those who want Euro or Sterling tables will seek those. And those who seek Bitcoin tables...you get the picture. Converting into fiat currency will not be attractive to Bitcoin holders. They want to use the currency, not prop up someone else's.
Everyone wants liquidity but mixing currencies in not a solution at the table level. If you have dollar tables only then you're not catering for the Bitcoin crowd.
Seals With Clubs has been around for a little while and can be considered very successful, [when one compares their standing against the competition]( - currently 
Regulation-wise, there are many options to choose from. Some jurisdictions are geared-up more towards Bitcoin based operations fitting in. Others (Malta, I'm looking at you) might require a bit more paperwork. That being said, the MFSA is aware of Bitcoin and has no problems with it, therefore the LGA logically should not either.
Whichever route is chosen, at the top of the priority list must be player confidence.

[That is correct](
Yesterday afternoon I was at a presentation in Malta where the CTO of Exante explained Bitcoin to the attendees. It was a good effort, considering he was scheduled for only 15 minutes (although he did take a little more time). The audience appeared to be a little more than perplexed. Then came a panel discussion. This was a good attempt to start a discussion on the topic, but it did seem like the blind leading the blind. Some pearls of wisdom, emanating from those on the panel, that I scribbled down in my notes:
"I would recommend staying away from Bitcoin."
"They are physical, right? Okay, let's say you have a whole box of Bitcoins..."
"What happens when there are no more Bitcoins? The bottom will fall out of the market. At least with Dollars you can print more."
"Bitcoin is not a currency...it is like bartering with a chicken or a cow."
"You can buy child-porn with Bitcoin. Child-porn, durgs and hitmen. That's it."
"[The Winklevoss twins'] Bitcoins were seized recently."
Although there was much palming of the face in one corner of the room, the closing statement by the moderator made me feel that not all was lost:
"If you don't believe in Bitcoin, you should not believe in Euro, or Dollar, or any other currency."

Sorry, that might look somewhat confusing. What I was suggesting was that if the statement was:
"US Dollar is not a currency...it is like bartering with a chicken or a cow."
Would the same still ring true? Considering both Dollars and Bitcoin are the *medium* of exchange and the chickens and cows are the assets being sought, the statement should not be true in either the case of US Dollars or Bitcoin.
That should be a little clearer than me throwing regex formatting in a non-tech sub.

I had read your comment "having both currencies to choose from at the tables", as meaning you would operate multi-currency tables, and not that you would support both types of tables - USD &amp; BTC. Thanks for the clarification.
Then the next thing I would question will be the tournaments and bonuses schemes.
Would this not work better by using the same gaming infrastructure but bring up a new environment to handle Bitcoin only sites and then produce a bunch of white label Bitcoin poker sites to cover as much ground as you can?
In this way you ensure that each business (USD &amp; BTC) and each brand (PokerUSD1.com, PokerBTC4.com, PokerBTC5.com) cannot directly affect the bottom line of each other business? In that, should PokerUSD2.com not perform as well as the other entities, the failure of one skin will not pull down the others. With everything in one basket you run the risk of a single failure on one side of the business can destroy the lot.
We need more Bitcoin in online gaming. It is good to see forward-looking people eyeing this market.

You will need to find a solution to the multi-currency betting issue.
What do I mean by this? That if I sit at a table that accepts USD, EUR and BTC at the table then as the game progresses, the value of each player's bets will shift in value. Currency pairs are rarely static (except in the cases where currency A is pegged to currency B.
Even in a situation where there are only two players at a table, if the value of BTC follows its traditional path of shifting wildly in value, by the end of the hand, one player may find they have been staking far more than the opponent. Now switch that back to the same currency. One player will have received less reward than they would have by better at single currency tables.
Do you see any multi-currency tables anywhere on the Internet? There is a reason for this and the addition on one more currency will not provide a solution.

I'm not questioning the mechanics of fractional-reserve banking, I am questioning how this would be possible with Bitcoin. In the above example, how would you create these additional 900 Bitcoin? Where from? How would you add this to the blockchain?
