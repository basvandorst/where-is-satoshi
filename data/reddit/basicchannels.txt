Chill man, it’s still at 13. It’s only a few weeks ago we were euphoric at it hitting 10. 13 seems like the baseline atm, might be good time to buy. They did a whole show on bitcoin yesterday on LBC. It’s not going anywhere, normal people want to get into it now

Let them think that! I remember there was one interview about a record exec talking about how Steve Jobs came into a board meeting once and said “you guys have had your heads up your asses for too long” in relation to the advent of online music. Whilst everyone was more interested in distancing themselves for it, Jobs pivoted and subsequently leveraged their collective nativity towards his favor. Created iTunes, negotiated absurdly cheap licencing deal and the rest is history! 
If someone doesn’t believe or see the potential in crypto then fine! More opportunity for us! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:12:35
Could it also be a concerted effort by banks to short it in prep for opening their own exchanges ie like Goldman Sachs. So people buy in low and they profit off it?

See this is where I start smelling bullshit. Maybe I’m being cynical but Coinbase is a well established business, it’s like when I said it’s the same as buying something from Amazon. How convenient that in this instance they’d outright block it but if someone uses my card in Africa or my phone bill was £300 I would most likely have to call up and report it after first spotting it myself. The fact it was for such little sums of money is suspect too, why would it flag up?
I think they’ve got an elaborate array of various algorithms with one being something that tracks the duration that money stays in your account to being sent elsewhere. I think it’s more the speed at which I’m transferring into Coinbase from when I get any money that’s of interest to them rather than any exterior fraud threat

Ahahaha. I started talking to a friend the other day about BTC and how high the price was and turns out he had some cos his friend made him get some a while back. He had 500 quids worth and now it’s worth around 20k. He went straight on the phone to his dad who said “you should have told me son, I would have given you some money to invest for me” and he just said HAHA imagine if years ago he told his dad he was gonna invest in some opaque cyber currency.
Just look out for yourself bro, if they don’t get it they just don’t get it

The idea of a “good currency” is pretty contentious though isn’t it? 
In regards to fractional banking system - loosely speaking if you deposit £100 to your bank and are left with £2 of “real money” combined with quantative easing, variable exchange rates, inflation and all the rest of it - doesn’t conventional money fail those characteristics too? 
The only difference is, it’s covered up better. But if anything that just makes it worse and even more unreliable. 
The only thing that makes Fiat money appear more reliable is the population of trust in it. Currency is only worth anything proportionate to the amount of trust people have in it. Trust accumulates and eventually frameworks of accessibility will be established. Right now the silly Legibility and wildly fluctuating prices seem crazy but that’s only because we’re seeing it from or in relation to another currency as opposed to from within the currency itself. For example would you be converting or thinking about what your grocery shopping would be in Korean won every time you went out? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:10:09
Same man. I said the exact same thing earlier. Just see it as our generations boxing. 50 years ago they had Muhammad Ali, now we got P2P cyber currency. Also life’s so much sicker when you only think in terms of up and down, everything else is a waste of time

No duh. Just take it with a pinch of salt. There’s still plenty of good convo in this sub, but what are you expecting? It’s not LSE or UCL. You’ll enjoy the sub more if you lighten up a bit. The other more serious subs like /BTC are just a click and tab away. And talking about what annoys you is great, but it’s even better if you contextualise your grievance with something positive of your own to contribute to give people an idea of the kinds of changes you’d think would make a difference

Yeah exactly the fucking weakest most predictable argument ever. How’s it any different to buying something off Amazon? They don’t have a leg to stand on. It’s not like it’s being traced to some dodgy location in Africa. They know exactly what they’re doing. This right now represents a pseudo-run on the banks and they’re fucking terrified. To use litigation against something as petty as a £50 transact just proves they’re not taking this lightly
