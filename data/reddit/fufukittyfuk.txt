on the app side of things.  QR code based transactions, seller shows balance and QR code, buyer scans QR to make transaction.  If both parties are in the Google payments ecosystem auto labeling of the transaction in the account history along with receipt.  Humble Bundle does this well on there end.  However My Bitcoin wallet transaction log always needs to be manually updated so i know what the transaction was.
One button QR scan.  Opening the wallet app, waiting for it to load, then pressing the camera that may or may not be in a menu somewhere is too long to wait at a checkout.  Having a special Bitcoin App button or smart widget that loads directly to a QR scanner would make it way easier.  Alternatively having the app load directly to qr scanner when not at home or at work.  Have a easy to press button encase it guesses wrong and you don't want to purchase something.
If (there is a transaction from one of your Bitcoin addresses not from one of your approved devices) {do an auto alert to the user text message of a possible compromised wallet.};
OPTIONAL, ENCRYPTED (before sending) backup of your keys to Google servers, Dropbox, etc..
Integrate with "OK Google" so i can send friends Bitcoin with a voice command.  "Send point zero five Bitcoin to Alice." 0.05 Btc -&gt; Alice. or "send SOME Bitcoin to Bob" and then have a on screen prompt for the amount.  Either would REQUIRE on screen confirmation, since voice commands are not 100% accurate on whats is being said or by whom.
On the business, optional support for converting to local currency, easily switch between multiple wallets.  I am not a end point retailer but i would assume automated wallet management would help.
Allow for settings for confirmations before saying a transaction is valid based on inside or outside the Google payments ecosystem, Return customer, amount of the transaction.

Checking out Bitcoincharts.com and it looks like Bitfinex had no updates in 1 day 5 hours and LakeBTC had no updates in three days.  It might not be related but before they went dark they accounted for roughly a third of Bitcoin USD trading (combined).  Even with that looking over the past six months this is still relatively stable.

The truly sad answer is yes.

That is what  is.  It is a sad abomination of the law. Edit .. Sorry for the link I'm on mobile app.

A bitcoin mining setup would be great there, as long as electricity price could be recovered.

If my memory serves, isn't the signature really a one way hash of the ordinal message that is than encrypted with your private key. people can check it by using you public key to decrypt it and compare the hash of the text they got with the decrypted hash? 
Edit --- This verifies the text is unaltered and it was you who sent it.

Not sure where your getting your info from, but I am looking at the humble bundle page right now and there is still a working bitcoin donation button.

Unless I an misunderstanding you, I don't think you can respend them 25 times when there still in queue and zero confirmations.

Between FreeBSD (FreeNAS / pfSense as based on it) and Debian (Dam near everything Linux based is from Debian, with some exceptions.) i reduced my home to just one windows gaming box and I am happier.  Now only if I could get Debian to accept Bitcoin also that would be great.
ProTip: Use [Humble Bundle's]( or the Humble Bundle Store to get games with Bitcoin.  Most computer games I have received from them also had a steam key AND my Bitcoins help charities.

Thank you. I have added Bitstamp to the list.

Great tip.  On the list i noticed there was an exchange I did not see mentioned elsewhere, The Rock Trading Company.  I have included it into the list.

For your data enjoyment, The Data for the last 14 Days (2-May-2013 15-May-2013)
Using the Weighted Sum USD from MTGox.  The Average is $111.23 with a Standard Deviation of $6.97 (6.27%).  The Low was $91.30 (3-May) and High of $118.30 (10-May)
The single lowest trade was $79.00 (3-May).
The single highest trade was $126.90 (2-May).
The problem with following the Low and High markers is they can be manipulated.  It is much harder to move the Weighed Sum.  The Weighted Sum also reflects the typical price the average person would have paid on that day.
