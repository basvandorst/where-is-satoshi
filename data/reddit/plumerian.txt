Ireland is a beautiful country. But when the potatoes run dry, fuck Ireland. Crypto is math, like countries are mere lines in the sand. Neither will be offended to see them as such. The goal is never "maximalism" anything in tech, but sheer utility. If smoke signals were effective units of global digital value, we'd talk about flint rocks and kindling. So the inverse of your question is equally valid. If we already have Monero's privacy, why own bitcoin? Rest assured politics will be the trump card here, and all parties will resume the conversation on all fours.

Masses of people are unfathomably ignorant. It took public education decades of struggle (one that continues) to even integrate evolution into the curriculum. Bitcoin should have it much easier, being that there are people born in today's world that don't recall there ever NOT being an internet. "Digital money" will be a given eventually. And the blockchain technology will make sense in light of biomimicry and its representation of natural biological and ecological systems that are decentralized.

I would say it is very "vital." As a medium of human transactions and exchange, money is massively instrumental in our society and future. Part of what clicks in people's brains once they begin researching the blockchain technology, is that this is more than another store of value.

It has lots of relevance. People use the search feature on this sub to scout out listed concerns others have had previously (or listed successes). I've done this previously before seeking out a specific company for their services. Because you can't immediately derive benefit from this, doesn't mean someone else can't. So your comment is a bit ironic.

@_date: 2014-12-06 21:52:29
I like this approach, however the majority of this information is already available with a simple Google search. The reason tipping is so effective, I believe, is because it interjects into someone's routine quite spontaneously with a shiny incentive (they can later learn that we're the new overlords and they must join or we'll eat their babies). 
It seems you are trying to crowd-fund new content creation in the hopes it will go viral and inspire bitcoin newbies. Is this correct? Because it still leaves undetermined how we deliver this new content to the uninitiated to begin with, unless they seek it out. But why would they seek it out? The problem becomes recursive. 
I like analyzing the problem of adoption from the perspective of social psychology. What motivates people is usually ego-driven. Bitcoin is already cheaper and more efficient as a form of digital money. To maximize distribution for remittance and commerce, we merely need people to believe. That's all that makes reality work: belief. To catch on then it needs to incentivize people (via tipping, or retail/merchant savings), and most importantly, bitcoin needs to look cool as shit. 
So, perhaps in constructing this "viral" video of yours (as one example from the list), deconstruct what elements lend a video to become viral, and them implement this in your approach. Corporations have already hacked this strategy. That's why sometimes it's hard to discern user content from commercials (at least by front page dwellers).

I have a question that is relevant for entry-level folks, or non-tech people in general: how easy will it be to understand and participate in the network? Tor was relatively easy because it functions like a web browser, and a thorough knowledge of the system isn't necessary in order to use it. Similarly, I feel like making things as comprehensive and intuitive as possible with bitcoin will assist in widespread adoption.

When you divide a bitcoin in half, you don't get double spending power. Just like when you divide a dollar in half you get the same spending power, just in two separate amounts. Similarly, dividing a bitcoin into pieces doesn't double your spending power, or increase the currency number in circulation. [This has been discussed extensively.](

Moving the decimal point on a bitcoin just means a further fraction of a bitcoin is represented. The larger structural token, 1 BTC, is controlled and remains limited. Dividing a dollar into change doesn't inflate the total number of dollars in the economy.

That's why I try and be mindful of Robert Anton Wilson's "Maybe Logic." It's congruent with what he coined [pun intended] from his "Quantum Psychology" book. That is, most things in the human world exist in the *maybe* state - and we should approach them as such. As soon as we latch onto the unquestionable validity of something, be it money or any other modus operandi, we kill creativity and curiosity. The pedagogy these days is too busy teaching *what* to think, instead of confronting the harder task of informing each other *how* to think. But I digress.

I think they mean... **stolen**. Asset forfeiture, private prisons, and other for-profit variables surrounding the drug war are among the reasons we still put people in tiny cages for victimless, non-violent crimes.

Yes. I watched it several days ago when it was first published in the 21 funding announcement thread.

But those are legal and good for my children! The commercials told me so.

If stereotyping weren't partially true, targeted advertising wouldn't be worth billions.
@_date: 2015-02-24 19:15:21
Haha yes, I've gotten that impression from the few travel videos I've seen. It looks fairly touristy.

The whole "peer-to-peer" concept hasn't quite been realized yet... lol. That's the big whammy.

Notice the "names" of the responders. Flows nicely, eh?

And extracting capital from countries inhabited by poor brown people. Colonization has played a massive economic role in most empires. No paper printer required.

What does this have to do with the video?
@_date: 2015-02-03 15:37:27
I have nothing against that subreddit personally, nor the atheistic sentiment in general. I just used it as an example of orientating around contrariety. 
@_date: 2015-02-05 14:03:16
What's up with this on the website?
"Dear community, Richard ‘Avantopia’ Kowalski squatted Darkwallet.com. We have no way to reach him. He never replied us on Google+, Bitcointalks and other inbox such as richard If you can get any information to help us to reclaim Darkwallet.com, please contact us on Twitter

Did they ever lock your access to your funds? What was the outcome of this correspondence? 
@_date: 2015-02-03 15:50:41
Meh. There are good people and bad people in every group. I'm familiar with the Angels via Jack Kerouac &amp; the Beat writings, then later Hunter S. Thompson's writing. I've seen video interviews, seen them riding around, etc. I don't see any devils. But more pertinent in our case here, I don't see people capable of understanding cryptography and encryption.

Smells like that "divide and conquer" turd up in here. Next thing you know we'll be arguing about race, nationalities, and political parties.

And Circle. I should've taken a selfie of my asshole. Joking aside, I'm well aware it's regulatory compliance. Yada yada.

I understand the hatred for redundant altcoins around here. The difference being DRK actually addresses the anonymity issue. If Darkwallet can efficiently obfuscate identifying information, I will gladly use it. I don't pick sides. Whatever gets the job done.

Equally intriguing to me is that your last post was over 5 years ago.

I sold an account with a purple p hat, santa, full d with chain &amp; whip back in the day for around $700 USD. Any idea what that would be worth today?

No biggie...

Drug kingpins? Funny how those come about. Surely not due to prohibition. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 01:46:38
There's also a pattern of people seeing bullish patterns. This has gone on since the all time high, and yet we've been in a bear market and the price has declined. I'm bullish long term, and I see your reference, but cautiously waiting for a break of this wedge we're in. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 19:23:40
Gotcha. Maybe if the lottery were more enticing, it could invite more people to set up new nodes. 
@_date: 2015-02-22 17:07:35
Interesting. How is an "incentivized" node different from a regular node? In terms of incentives, I feel like the network could be more robust in terms of number of different nodes by incentivizing people with micropayments in one way or another. This is part of the idea of Storj, who intend to reimburse people for cloud sharing their hard drive space.

This is great work, kudos.
