Sounds like he's worried it might actually offer more utility and convenience than the dollar.

And this is why BTC is by far the most congested cryptocurrency network.

Just realized the desks in the photo are the same ones they used on set.

Yeah thats really the best because if you say you have one just don't wanna give it, then I'm like ok well you need points so go get yourself a Gmail and Google voice. I feel like people know this but just want to be a pain and make sure the retail worker keeps low stats. It's really dumb though because honestly everybody would win if customers just made up their number or email but people just want to make a point that they don't want to give one. And honestly there are plenty of rewards under known phone numbers out their waiting for somebody to get free stuff.

Yes retail employees have monthly quotas they need to meet as far as credit card signups, reward account signups, email receipts, and related programs. Before I worked retail I was always that person who was like no quit asking me for my information so I totally get the other side of it. But then I decided to give up my real job to move across the country, ended up working retail and making less money so I actually had a real need to become an expert on rewards type of programs and now a year later I've saved hundreds of dollars if not more. So I ended up going pretty gung-ho on rewards signups and actually set a record for the company. Not that anyone higher up actually cares but still kind of exciting, making the most out of an otherwise boring job. 
Do whatever works best for you and your own shopping habits, but the truth is just paying with your regular card and giving your real phone number for some extra brownie points probably won't save you that much in the long run, you have to put in more effort than that. So if you are already preoccupied with another business that brings you money and don't have time to play any kind of rewards program games then yeah just say you don't have a phone number, don't use email or whatever and they will just have to leave you alone. But if you feel adventurous and want to get surprise discounts then yeah totally just give like 310-867-5309 as your number.

Going to be the thorn in everyone's side and point out this is slightly misleading. Yes we know the amount of tokens within the boundaries of Bitcoin is always going to be known and cannot be manipulate, BUT, it turns out that for everyday transactions, Litecoin is now used almost as frequently. So as far as total digital money supply, it can still inflate beyond any fixed number. With the lightning network and improved cross chain swapping, it might not be as hard to print new cryptocurrency as we thought as long as it conforms to the increasingly popular segregated witness standard. HOWEVER, one big difference is that the general public has to give the new currency value and accept its use. So even if it could be easily swapped with BTC or another currency, it could never truly disguise itself as another currency. Like right now there's no way a business could tell if a particular US dollar was generated through quantitative easing, because if they could then those dollars wouldn't be worth as much.

Yes that's how investments are typically described. If your stock goes down 50% then you need it to increase 100% to get back to where you were.

It looks like you can redeem the voucher online but you have to pay with dollar bills at the coinstar which totally defeats the purpose of using the coinstar in the first place!

Which is going to go higher, the BTC price or that lady's neck?

Social media sentiment is the number one indicator of future market activity, after all. Unleash the bulls!

They do this in the form of using their own credit card and getting rewards to bring you back into the store, which is BS from the consumer standpoint.
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:52:44
Yes that's exactly right.
