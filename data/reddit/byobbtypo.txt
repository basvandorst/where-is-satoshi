I'm always a little hesitant to bet on just any startup since this current situation draws many parallels between the dot com bubble.
bitcoin=the internet
bitcoin related startups=dotcoms
We all know the internet survived, but many dotcoms did not. 
That said, I too enjoy speculating!

I dont know if it's been done or not, but a site like bitcoinity.org where there are overlapping graphs of each exchange so you can see which exchanges are leading in real time. 
Like bitstamp, gox, btce, btc china or whatever exchanges you select. The line graph would overlap and you could see them all in real time instead of switching back and forth, with different colored lines denoting each exchange.  Does that make sense?

It will take a while before adoption goes mainstream for sure, but do the masses really need to understand it beyond the  basics to use it effectively? I don't think so. I think mass adoption happens when bitcoin becomes better than the alternative.

The people here can be fuckheads for sure. I posed the same question once upon a time and got similar bullshitty answers from the bitcoin hive mind. 
To answer your question, primecoin is useful for some reason that I do not understand. You can earn ripple xrp for contributing computing power to the world community grid (there are various projects you can work on). I dont have the resources to mine anymore so I do that for fun. Ive earned a bit of xrp which I hope to save for a rainy day.

If a billion people buy into etoro bitcoins, it will have no affect on the price of bitcoins.

You make good points all around, especially regarding the VCs not buying actual bitcoins, but investing in services that could really be upgraded to cater any crypto. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 23:27:58
This is clearly an example by the federal government to put a black eye on bitcoin. To Joe six pack, a million is a trillion and his knee jerk reaction is to say bitcoin is the devil because drugs etc.

Primecoin does something like that but the significance of finding strings of prime numbers is wayyy over my head.
People on fuckin hate ripple, but you can participate with the world community grid and donate CPU and GPU power to a variety of their programs (clean energy project, mapping cancer markers etc) and join the ripple team to earn XRP, then trade for bitcoin. 
Just sayin!
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:37:24

Good idea.

3)Start a pool for said association.

It's Bigger than dollars. I'm not thinking in terms of dollars. 
I think comparing BTC to Dollars is like comparing a castle to an old  house. Sure the house looks okay for a couple years, but that bitch is going to collapse sure as shit. That castle, well, it's big and empty and cold right now but it's going to be there for you when you need it. 
Except when you need it, it's going to be a full house and living there won't be cheap.

I agree

Make sure you get a BTC ATM there so i can sail down from Canada on my  BTC funded sailboat and take out some cash.  Now if I could only get some bits into my account....

aha I see they have margin trading as well! Let the games begin! And the lender option...that's both dodgy and interesting.

Hah ya I'm drunk though

I think the appeal would be to the bitcoin 'superuser', as opposed to the retail demographic

Like I said before, I'm not too versed on the tech side of things so forgive me for asking: what's a 51% attack and is it possible? Seems like you'd need a lot of computing power to do something like that...
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:00:15
Haha well that sounded like a big ol fuck you to the man. Have an up vote 
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:18:14
Don't count out the surrounding areas. People in the BC interior will probably make the journey to get some, if they can't got them online of course.
Also, the amount of people who grow pot in the Okanagan will spur money launder........wealth transfer. Lot's of cash up there and these boys know it.

I'm pretty hung over but I read through it. It's very interesting and the returns are unreal. Better than this junior miner but for this you need to be an accredited investor which IMO is fuckin elitist and is contradictory to the idea of bitcoin. 
That said, it's a great start for them to be a pioneer company in the early stages of bitcoin. Hat tip

That's very insightful thank you. The answer is no to the miner 
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:42:53
I agree with you fully and completely.

We should start a club or something

Full disclosure: This is coming from a complete idiot. 
I think the weakness in bitcoin is the key because a leap in quantum computing could enable someone to brute force private keys.

I honestly do not understand namecoins what the shit are they? A part of a DNS sort of?

I could maybe. It's difficult for me to wrap my mind around at the moment.

No I won't stop using that phrase.
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:35:03
No worries, thanks for chiming in. In your opinion, at what price would we see the top of the s-curve? 
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:06:28
do you think that people will be using BTC 10+ years from now?
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:14:03
Good on you for accepting bitcoin. my business is strictly B2B so I'm trying to formulate a way to incorporate it into my business and Industry. 
I'd really like to be an industry first so I can lead the pack.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:44:10
I think it'll adapt to a more usable form and to a more secure store of value. I have some wild predictions that I may post up later in r/bitcoin, just so I can go back in 5 years and prove to myself, everyone I know and most importantly you internet strangers that I was right for once.

A million bucks isn't a lot for institutional investing.
