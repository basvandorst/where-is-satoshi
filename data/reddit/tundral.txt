Especially if this was done by a piece of malware on the device then this feature might have just saved OPs BTC. If you don't keep the seed safe then it's your fault if you lose your BTC because another person or an app wiped your wallet be retrying too many times

Am I completely oblivious or don't Ledger and Trezor both give you the seed with the words to backup your wallet?

I think there's some sort of time system where if one party doesn't respond for a long enough time the channel is closed and everything given to the co-operative party. I'm not sure though.

I wont ridicule you and try to actually give you an explanation:
Think of the lightning network payment channels like this:
You and your friend tell the bank [the blockchain] that you're going to manage $20 of money in the form of signed payments between yourself and your friend. [You want to open a payment channel] 
The bank then takes $10 from both of your accounts (so totaling $20) and tells you that you can now trade as you wish with the $20 by singing transactions to each other. [The opening of the channel is recorded on the blockchain]
You go about trading funds by signing payment like: "I want to move $10 to bob in the agreement [payment channel] we've established." And then instead of sending these to the bank you send these to each other and keep them as proof of what's been going on in the agreement.
Once you're done transacting with each other you both sign an announcement to the bank that you want to close this agreement with each other. You both also provide the bank with the signed transactions between you so that the bank can make sure the final balances are valid. Once the bank has validated that the balances that your agreement ended up to are valid it distributes the $10+$10 it had taken from your accounts according to the agreement and payments.
If one of you for reason refuses to sign the notification to close the channels the bank will then (after a certain period of time) forcefully close the agreement and give all the money in the agreements ($20 in this case) to the participant that was co-operative
This way you can move funds in between each other without having to deal with the slowness and cost of every transaction going through the bank. But in the end, your money is still in the bank and the transactions are still audited by the bank in the end. 
This wouldn't work without the bank since the bank is the one that guarantees that the participants are playing by the rules and will punish uncooperative parties that try to game the system.

I've been using them mainly to pay for things for around 6-7 years now and I've been happy mainly cause as a buyer there's usually no problems.
But god forbid if you try to receive a payment for selling some BTC on a P2P exchange. I sold my BTC I had made from using NiceHash in December and instantly moved it to my bank. Apart from the high fee I didn't mind anything about the service 
I went on with my life as normal and suddenly about a month and a half later I get an email from PP informing me that there's been a dispute for a sell I made.
Turns our the buyer (who had over 1000 trades with 99% feedback on Localbitcoins.com) or whoever owns the card the payment had been made with.
I didn't mind the -200€ balance and thought that PP would resolve the case in my favor since O hadn't done anything wrong and am a lrgit customer.
Well turns out PP debits the missing balance fromy your attached credit/debit card to cover the negative balance along with any purchase you make through their service (even subscription payments) so now I'm 200€ down and PP doesn't tell me anything except "under review" when I try to check the status on the dispute page.
I don't know what they'll do with the dispute but if they don't give me my money back I'll definitely make a chargeback request with my bank and hope PP will have to pay chargeback fees for both mine and the buyers chargebacks
Like wasn't PP supposed to be an easy service to send money to anyone with just an email address? Sure as hell doesn't seem to be working that way if I as a private person with a personal PP account have to worry about chargebacks when selling some BTC for a few hundred Euro

So Visa handles all transaction done around the globe with all currencies with all cards, cash and other forms of payment and transfer?
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:49:40
Well yes but when you had no blockchain where everything ended up you would have to keep all transaction ever made available so that one could verify that another person's channel actually has enough value. The amount of data stored would get as massive as the blockchain, be hard to store and promote centralization of lightning nodes in the end when the transaction data storage is too large.

How would you go about sending BTC through multiple channels to a recipient in a system where all channels wouldn't start and end in the blockchain? 
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:16:44
How do you mean? 
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:16:10
Even currently you have to pay a small fee to make a transaction. That fee goes to the miner who adds your transaction to their block and finds the block. How fast your transaction is added to the blockchain depends on the amount of fee you're willing to pay. Essentially you need to bid for your transactions place on the next block.
That's the system that's supposed to keep Bitcoin running once all of the

Lightning addresses both of these problems!

Well really once you've opened enough channels to be able to trade with the people and organizations you want to trade with you might not need to ever close the channels.
Well if there's no blockchain how is anyone going to prove that the BTC they have inside the LN are actually valid. 
Just like my example wouldn't work without there being money in the bank to insert into the agreement system the parties want to estsblish
Also in a blockchainless system the problem of storing and checking TXs would become huge if all of them would have to be stored indefinitely to be checked if one wants to verify a balance of a lightning user. 
As far as I know (and if I'm wrong someone please correct me) once a channel is closed the details of the TXs inside the channels are not kept anywhere, as the BTC nodes have checked the legitimacy of the transactions made on lighting.
