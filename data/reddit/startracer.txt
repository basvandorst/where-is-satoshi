I guess his point is just that, that the current blockchain DLP is slow and inefficient and there will be better and more efficient alternatives with the same properties of being secure and decentralized.


If it's decimated like you say, it will also be more vulnerable to attacks. Especially state actor sized attacks.

There are some good arguments here which mostly (all?) boil down to the problem of scalability and the expensive blockchain POW mechanism. 
Another important point which I fear he's going to be proven right about in the end, is how the current "libertarian" crypto currencies will turn into the perfect tool for governments to have full visibility and control of its citizens economic activities by simply outlawing all except the state controlled ditto.
What do you think?

That's true. But for those commodities there aren't much of a choice, which might not be true for a DLP. Although maybe natural diamonds are a good example because they are more or less worthless as an industrial commodity, so there's only a "perceived" value.


Yeah, I'm not so sure about it either. But I guess the point remains that we're just in the beginning of this new age. I'd be quite arrogant to think that there's never going to be a better solution.


Can you elaborate on that? As I've understood it, the difficulty will adjust every 2016 blocks to average 10min/block. So simply speaking with increasing network size it follows that the time to find a block will be reduced and thus an increased difficulty and more energy "wasted".


I hope you're right. Sadly with the direction personal freedom is going in I'm not that hopeful.

Very relevant.

And in the case of bitcoin, what determines consensus? My understanding is that it's the simple majority. Because you can't e.g. have unanimous decisions, then any single attacker would be able to scuttle the system.
If it is simple majority Then if a situation occurs where the majority runs the same software, any result due to a bug in that software would by default be accepted as the correct answer for the network as a whole.
Given how much thought went into designing bitcoin, surely it can't come down to if the software is bugfree or not?

Ok, so then the the blockchain would be forked. I wonder what would happen then.
@_date: 2015-07-27 13:46:52
It seems to me that we don't want a majority to run the same software for this very reason.
Similar to that we don't want 50+% of the hash-rate to be in the control by one group.

Ok, I've understood the result of forking blockchains. But I don't understand that everyone in this thread seems willing to accept it. If I invest in bitcoins I don't friggin want to end up in the wrong blockchain if a fork happens, I could loose a ton of money.

We're talking about incompatible block chains, not chainblock contention solving.
