I don't understand your argument. Bitcoin hasn't rocketed straight up. You are right, no asset has ever done that. Bitcoin is no exception. Just look at the bitcoin chart. It goes up and down.

The interest rate for BTC is too high. Only an idiot buys with a deflationary currency.
I like crypto, but this is admittedly one of the problems with it. What if the economy needs to spend more to be healthy? The Fed can't just inflate the currency since they have no control on the supply or rates. I fear they may resort to regulating electricity prices to control mining.

How can BTC be good for investing but not real workd use? Its an oxymoron. Crypto’s value comes from its use, so if it cant be used, its worth nothing except hype
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:42:37
Ok so? It still goes up or down. Is your argument that no other asset in the world have gone up within 4 days, because that's false.

If you dont trust them, how do you trust the laws will protect your rights? Net neutrality gives the FCC broad discretionary powers. Its not like a list of rules with no wiggle room. Its a list of one vague principle with tons of wiggle room for the FCC to do what it wants. Supporting net neutrality is necessarily trusting the FCC

Because banks didn't do anything illegal. The scary part about the financial crisis was that it was all legal. That's why the response was to implement a bunch of new regulation. If the problem was illegal, then we wouldn't have to implement new rules, just improve enforcement. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:52:10
How are they criminals? Criminality requires a centralized authority that enforces rules. Cryptocurrencies don't have that.

5 months late to the party, but when I see misinformation, I respond. 
There is nothing innately wrong with a high gdp-to-debt ratio. Economists have been trying to figure out the dangerous level for years, but have not been successful. In fact, the post-crisis austerity measures in Europe were based on a threshold theory of gdp-to-debt ratio that ended up being false. 
To put this in perspective, Japan has a gdp-to-debt ratio of 300%, and its economy is the furthest thing from a bubble (the Japanese Central Bank has been trying to start a bubble for over a decade). 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:24:58
Why is this bad though? The cost of a decentralized system is accepting the risk of attacks from wealthy people. If we disliked this, we can just go back to fiat currency with a central bank that fends off attacks. We cannot back a decentralized system and judge attackers. That's the price we pay. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:10:46
The price of Nvidia goes up because nvidia makes products society values. The price of Apple goes up because they make products people value. Why does bitcoin go up? The definition of a bubble is the price going up faster than the product provides value to society. If you think bitcoin has no value to society as a currency (which you said), then how is it not a bubble?
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:44:33
Why is the price going up?

I don't understand your adoption argument. Adoption means that people will use bitcoins instead of dollars to purchase goods. That's it. Your (3) touches on it, but you seemed to say it with caution. ETFs, mining, etc doesn't make adoption more real. It just means the speculation is moving from random people online to large institutions.  Remember, there were institution-provided tradeable securities for the subprime mortgages too, and that was all speculation. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 02:23:31
But telephones and cars were 'adopted' through use, as they brought value to people's lives. But many people are buying bitcoins just to speculate - just because they think the price will increase for whatever reason, and they want to profit. they aren't buying it because they value the underlying technology. I bet the majority of bitcoin owners have no intention to use it as currency. I certainly don't. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 04:27:55
I use "gamble" because it is riskier than stock markets. Saying "bitcoins are a good bet because they will become valuable in the future" is speculation, pure and simple. It's a guess and a blind bet. You have no evidence to believe bitcoins are the future other than your faith. 
Either bitcoins are becoming more popular because it is gaining legitimacy as a currency, or it is a product of speculation. There is no evidence one way or the other, so either way it's a blind guess backed by nothing but a gut feeling. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 03:05:01
There are different kinds of risks. In the spectrum of risks, your argument is closer to a gamble. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 02:21:54
I didn't say I think it's a bubble, and generally a devil's advocate acts after an argument is made. But let me give it my best shot:
Mainly it's because it is driven by speculation, not value. The underlying tech isn't changing, so what value is driving the price changes? Many talk about how it matches other tech adoption, but people aren't "adopting" bitcoins. That is to say, the majority of bitcoin owners don't buy it because they believe in the currency. They just want to profit (i.e. speculate). 
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:49:46
Lol. I should have said, "I **generally** don't see economists crying bubble." But regardless, didn't we already agree Shiller doesn't think there is a bubble, but that he just didn't phrase his point clear enough? You said Shiller is "least of your concerns," so which economist(s) is the most of your concerns? 
@_date: 2017-10-01 05:07:17
But is my underlying theory correct? My perception is that Segwit2X might lead to the creation of two coins (essentially two versions of bitcoins). It's possible that a bunch of people dump one coin and buy the other, because they support that coin's underlying tech more. In that case, if I'm fast enough and I predict which coin will be more popular, can't I quickly sell my other coin and buy the winner coin and profit from the impending demand (assuming I guess the right coin)?
@_date: 2017-09-14 02:38:29
This is a possible reality, but I don't see how that's anything except speculation and hearsay. When something smells and looks like a bubble, then why should I believe a theoretical chicken-egg argument?
@_date: 2017-09-08 18:19:17
Indeed, every article I find heavily implies that Shiller is saying there is a BTC bubble. But then if you read the actual interview (with Quartz), he doesn't say that at all. The (paraphrased) line of question was:








It seems to me that he was using bitcoins as an example of irrational exuberance, not a bubble, and that he believes irrational exuberance suggest a bubble. I know this may seem pedantic and nit-picking, but as an economist, these details matter. I also despise the media's misrepresentation of arguments. 
When Eugene Fama calls it a bubble, then I'll join in on criticizing economists. But he never will, because economists know you can't recognize current bubbles. It's a contradiction: if you can recognize a bubble, then it is not a bubble by definition. 
Also, even if economists claim there is a bubble, I don't see why you take offense. Is it because you think a bubble implies a crash? Well, there is a new NBER paper which shows that out of the last 40 bubbles, only 20 led to a crash (fall of 40% or more).

The comparison to gold is the best counter so far. I don't have a rebuttal. Does anyone else?

The number of users increasing doesn't mean people are "adopting." It can also mean more people are speculating. Bitcoins are also not a product, like Apple. it's more like an exchange in value. A better analogy is a house. 
How did the housing bubble happen? Loose credit allows people to buy houses that **they never intended to use and brought no fundamental value to their lives.** Instead, they used borrowed money to buy houses, sit on it for a few months, then sell it at a higher price, using the profit to repay the loan (i.e. a Ponzi scheme). Bitcoins resemble this in that most of the people buying them only intend to sit on them until a higher price arrives. They do not have intention to use them as currency, just as the subprime mortgage buyers had no intention to live in their 4 houses. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 23:34:03
Ya, so if I guess with forked coin will be more popular, I can make some money by preemptively buying it right?
How does the split work? If I have 10 bitcoins now, how many BTC and how many B2X will I end up with?
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:27:41
Hmm so are you proposing that if we streamline the code, then Bitcoin can function as a global currency even at the 2mb blocksize?
Also I thought SEGWIT was meant to increase the blocksize

That's possible, but it sounds like speculation and hearsay.

I thought 2x was meant to be a more permanent solution, whereas Core was just a temporary coding change
@_date: 2017-09-14 02:36:55
I don't see any adoption. Adoption means people are using it to bring value to their lives. This reflects innate value in a product. For instance, people "adopted" the internet because it improved their lives. However, few people are buying bitcoins to improve their lives; few people care about bitcoin's uses as a currency and few intend to actually use it as a currency ("few" can mean as much as 100k people in a large market). Instead, they are only buying in to speculate the price. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:23:09
What economist thinks this? Most economists believe its impossible to determine an ongoing bubble
@_date: 2017-09-08 19:36:47
The disagreement is that I **don't** see economists crying bubble. What I see are financial analysts, accountants, investment professionals - careers that are not economists, but which lay people consider economists - crying bubbles. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:26:38
Ya but this has to happen eventually if BTC is trying to be a legit currency. Why put off the inevitable?

I've spent about 3 days reading about bitcoins, and I still don't get it. I've scoured this thread for answers, and I still don't get it. While smarter people like you can find answers through the answers of others, I require a back-and-forth to understand difficult concepts. You can call me stupid if you want, but I need to back-and-forth. I can't just read things passively. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:47:37
I didnt say they dont. I said not enough do. 
Think of the housibg bubble. It happened because people were buyibg houses to speculate, not live in. Of course, the majority of Americans lived in their houses, but not enough did

How would the NYA exchanges just destroy my Bitcoin? That would be theft. They must at least offer me to convert. I can see that their decisions make "nuke" it by driving price down, but they can't just delete my coins. 
And why is this split such a big deal, but the split to bitcoin cash wasn't?
@_date: 2017-10-01 06:02:32
Wait a minute. When segwit2x goes live, my money will double? I read the link on replay, but I'm not sure how it works. This is what I perceive (tell me why I'm wrong or right):
I have 2k BTC today. When the fork happens, I will have 2k BTC and 2k B2X. Without replay protection, I can convert 2k BTC to USD and 2k B2X to USD, netting me double my money?
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:56:09
is your argument the segwit side of the debate?
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:56:46

I'm still new to this world. I'm asking this question not because I want to profit, but because the answers to this question will help me understand other questions I have that are harder to put into words. 
My understanding is if segwit2x goes through, there could be a split into btc and another coin called btu. Isn't this what the 2017 compromise was? That the 18 exchanges agree to label one BTc and the other BTU?
