I first bought $200 when it was at $2200 per bitcoin. Then bought another $200 when it was at 2600 a piece. Then it started loosing value so I sold $300 when I loss $75 , then bought $300 when it went to $2850. For the past couple days , I've lost almost $ 100 but I'm hesitating to sell.

If I bought lots of small stocks with $400 , I would have more than $400 by now even if some stocks value go down. I haven't traded stocks or bitcoin prior to this purchase so I'm very impatient.whats the best advice or suggestions you can give me. I want to try stocks too and don't even know what platform or software I would need.

Definitely buddy! You can say it's not about getting rich quick but it's definitely about getting a positive return on investment. $400 worth of investment is a big deal to me since I'm a college student. Who wants to invest and loose? If you knew you will " definitely" loose 70% of your entire investments in a course of 30 yrs, obviously �� you will sell and get out that investment and put the money somewhere else right? What is your motive for selling out that share and buying new shares of something else....PROFIT, GAINS, POSITIVE ROI. I'm amateur in this whole bitcoin and investment thing but definitely you get me right?

Ooh really? How much do you think I'm missing? I should mention that I also sold almost everything when I lost almost $100 in July then bought it back again. I will make a new post with a screen shot of the buy/sell activity so you can see.

Wouldn't I have made some money if I put that 400 in stocks instead?
