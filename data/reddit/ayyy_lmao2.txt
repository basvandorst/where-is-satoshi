Apparently you have no idea what you are talking about, but for some reason you are pretending that you do.
A call to mkfs would just rebuild the inode table, which causes the filesystem to just assume everything is empty and write over the top of it when needed. The raw data will remain until it's overwritten. It doesn't actually zero out all the 1s and 0s on the flash storage, as this will take extra time and increase wear on the flash needlessly.
You can test this yourself on a Linux box by wiping a partition with a call to mkfs; you'll just see the inode table being written, no mention of zeroing out the storage. There are tools which can do this, but there is no reason for the phone to do this unless it has a strong focus on security. And you'd know if it was actually zeroing out the storage; it takes a while! A lot longer than just mkfs. If you're on a Windows box, you can test this by measuring the time difference between a "quick format", and a "full format" operations.
OPs bigger issue is that the data might be encrypted, depending on the version of Android installed (or if he turned on encryption manually). Then he'd have to not only recover the decryption key (which might be virtually impossible, depending on the hardware) but *also* the raw data.
I don't fancy his chances in any case :(

The fiat conversion is a quick way to ensure you're not being ripped off. If I see 0.001234 BTC or 0.0001234 BTC it's easy for the eyes to glaze over and not really register what's actually being spend. Some websites have crappy conversion rates as well, so again it's easier to see this with rate inside the wallet.
And as others have said, sending a small dollar amount is easy with this feature.
Unfortunately I'll be one of your lost users if this change is not reverted. Everything is based in fiat for the vast majority of people. In a few years this will hopefully change, but not yet.

I do wonder how some people this stupid don't get hit by a bus every time they step outside. What the FUCK do they think is in their bank accounts?
What's worse is stupid articles and reddit posts like this one give these morons a voice. Let them be left behind, let them suffer from trying to hold back innovation, nobody should care. Yet here I am commenting on this trash so I guess I'm part of the problem...
**The whole fucking system is "just data".** It's literally numbers in computers. If everyone actually tried to withdraw all their money into cash (y'know, so it's not "just data") tomorrow the entire system would collapse as there isn't physical ANYTHING to back up the numbers in their back accounts........ Hold on guys... I have an idea....

Would bip174 finally allow me to use my ledger with core, instead of having to run an electrumx server as well? Electrum is neat and all, but I'd rather just use my node directly.

I'm finished 'discussing' this with you. You are unreasonable and a proven liar in my mind. From lying about the 'backdoor' which doesn't exist to this absurd assertion which I know to be false.

No it doesn't. It askes *once* when you first start it. It clearly explains what it needs it for and if you decide you don't want it, you hit the cancel button **and it never asks you again**. I just tested this by reinstalling the app just now.
Even if you grant the permission, you *still* have to enable the remote control settings in the settings menu. Your falsely claimed "back door".
You are literally just lying now. You lied about this being a "backdoor" as presumably you didn't understand the definition of that word. Now you're literally just making stuff up for some obscene reason that defies logic. It's even more desperate given how trivial it is to verify.
Stop. Just stop. You got caught out. You were wrong. Stop digging a deeper hole for yourself by lying like this.

That's not a backdoor. That's literally nothing even *like* the definition of a back door.
It's a feature the user can enable if desired. It's not even "one misclick" away. You'd have to be pretty stupid to accidentally turn this on without knowing.
What you are describing is a theoretical bug which may or may not exist, alongside user misconfiguration.

It's really simple. I'll help you.
Rule 11:
Memes belong in not here. Pictures of license plates, 'we accept bitoin' stickers or signs, cars, or other low quality posts that do not contribute in a meaningful way do not belong here. These posts will be deleted when sighted.
Feel free to use that as a basis to implement a rule. Feel free to change the text if you need to. In fact, it looks like this might already be covered in rules 4 and 5.
Then all you have to do is consistently enforce the rules. And you're done.
See how easy that is?

You only set a RPC user and RPC password if you want to 'remote control' your node, for example, running a ElectrumX node from it.
These settings have literally nothing to do with the number of nodes you connect to or your wider visibility to the network.

**Of course** it's a scam. Open your eyes:
The "Watts mini" can mine all of this from one magical box:
**Bitcoin 120 TH/sLitecoin 30 GH/sEthereum 4 GH/sMonero 200 KH/sDash 1.1 TH/s**
Yeah.. suuuure. Totes legit that one!
edit: The product links doesn't even load: [ and the entire site is extremely slow to load any link at all. If you have a brain, **use it.**
And once again to remind everyone who may be a little new to this: If you owned 100s or 1000s of miners, you would put them to work for you at a profit. You would only 'rent' them out to others if they 1) didn't exist or 2) you could make even more profit by renting them to others than what they actually mine (therefore the customer will always lose money)
Use your brain and you'll be fine.

You like making things difficult.
Just use eclair wallet on Android. Open up a channel using the default settings, not routing to your defective node, then you'll get the experience everyone else is getting. It's still not perfect, it's still very beta, but it's a massive amount easier than what you're attempting.
You admit a couple of times that you don't really know what you're doing with LND, which is fine, I don't either. But why you are then insisting on doing everything the hard way baffles me.
