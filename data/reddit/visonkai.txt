It's not that he knows better, he just doesnt fall into the group that benefits. I know it must be hard to believe but not everyone can/wants to build a computer.

Regional finals are not seasonal finals. By definition, *Global* Seasonal Finals are not *Regional*.
I feel like you just wanted to correct someone on something.

For context, showmatches are generally $1k. A prizepool this huge is already causing disgruntled rumbling because it's "not fair to the winners of actual tournaments".
so it's best to save these BTC for a future event. You don't want to have the opposite effect and create negative PR towards BTC.

Well, they do still compete with each other, but generally speaking Koreans are given the benefit of the doubt by far over foreigners and are considered a separate group. Koreans play in foreign tournaments, foreigners do not play in Korean tournaments (because for the most part they can't even qualify. Naniwa and Scarlett could make it into the top Korean leagues, but there's better money in their home regions) And like the other people said, foreigners = anybody who is not from South Korea. This is an important distinction because some of the best foreigners are from China &amp; Taiwan.

Fortunately, in modern Starcraft, it doesn't happen very often. It's mostly just ESL/IEM that are late as fuck consistently every single time, but their lateness has been being reduced from years to months now which is good.

A showmatch with a premier prize pool might actually have the opposite effect and just piss everyone off since that's a ton of money for so little work.

It's actually a money match or showmatch between a Canadian and a Swede, so don't worry too much. The OP messed up his wordage when he chose "tournament".
