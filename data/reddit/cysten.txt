You seem to fail to understand the reasoning why you would have a law that makes driving over a certain Blood alcohol concentration illegal, although you hinted at it. Will some form of damage, either to life or property, occur every time some one drinks and drives? Probably not. Are the chances of damage occurring increased when someone is under the influence of alcohol? Yes. How can you reduce the risk of these damages occurring? By discouraging and making drink driving socially unacceptable through fines, loss of licence, and I believe the possibility of jail time. The law is all about reducing the risk of damage occurring.

Didn't even ask my question whether you think it is wrong that we restrict what can be taken on a plane. The issue with the examples you provide is that they do not apply to everyone of the sub category, just because you are a certain race doesn't mean you are going to commit a crime. However, if you drink alcohol your ability to function properly is reduce.

Your point can be summed up with this: I don't like being pulled over for random breath tests because screw reducing the risk of damages occurring I just want to get home. 
Once again, you have shown you don't not understand the concept about reducing risk. What is your opinions on laws preventing people from carrying weapons or materials that can be used to make an explosive device? Surly it is perfectly fine according to your logic since simply carrying those objects onto a plane doesn't instantly creat victims. 
Using a victim as deterrent doesn't work for everyone, considering just about everyone is self interested. They are disconnected from the idea of hurting someone because it is not them or they think that it will never happen to them. That is why you deter them by threatening thing that are directly relevant to them.
