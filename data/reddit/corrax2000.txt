Roughly a bit longer than you've waited so far :)
@_date: 2014-09-23 20:02:05
You're very welcome mate and much luck to you and your kickstarter project !
@_date: 2014-09-23 19:22:38
Real question is; why not ?
Its not alot of work to get this done and it cant hurt to have extra payment options.

nope its dropping thanks to Huobi opening their floodgates ( aka enabling direct bank transfers again after 8 months )
@_date: 2014-12-21 16:29:36
so i'm guessing the use of airmiles will get taxed twice as well ?

its not in his best interest to tell us how high or low their bid was. If he didnt get the winning bid (which right now he doesnt know) and still wants that amount of bitcoins he doesnt want the price to rise too much if word came out it was a high bid. However, if he did get the winning bid, but it was a low bid price, he wouldnt want the price to drop too much.
Either way, dont expect any news till monday

Probably went somewhat like this: algorithm triggers on the word "Bitcoin" in combination with some of your profile info. Person on the phone registered your question, by describing your question and adding the word Bitcoin to it, which got you automarked. Unintentionally.

"I am personally investigating and directing my legal team to investigate and take full legal action against on this Reddit of users who posts or comment lies or deceptions, and possibly even Reddit.com for facilitating this."  Good luck with that, welcome to the internet..

Well its really up to you, i do know some kickstarters added alternative backing options after they reached their minimal goal. The extra funding would then be used to reach new milestones and add extra features to whatever they were kickstarting at the time.
@_date: 2017-03-12 18:23:37
Yep thats the bright idea ! Now go cry over all the anonymous gift cards that can be used for just that too. Also, nevermind the fact 99,99% of these crimes are done with cash.
