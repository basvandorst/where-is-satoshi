A Surinam Brass Band is a lot of musicians. You can also involve dancers. The price is around 1500 €. It would be great to have a banner on the drums and a giant Bitcoin Flag in front of the Brass Band. 
It would be awesome if the funds could be raised through the members of Reddit.
All bits of bitcoin are welcome on:

Ofcourse we would love to buy you a beer just as well. Do you think you can find a place out there in spite of this peculiar legislation rule?

Done, that's better, quite right!

BitcoinBoulevard in The Hague (NL) has it's first sponsor!!!  has just send his BTC-fee to:
This fee is for the wallet of the Night-Mayer René Bom. He opens the BB at 17:50, 20 March. And he pays for the drinks with bitcoin and he gives the drinks to visitors, whom he likes.
If we could harvest more bitcoins then we also can pay for a Surinam Brass Band, that will walk around the canal. Thanks in advance ;-)

Hello everybody,
We've had an excellent proposal done by  She bought a Lamassu ATM and it will be shipped to the restaurant "Werelds", The Hague. Because she nor we have any experience in operating such an ATM. We will cooperate and start a learning curve in finding out how it could be a business opportunity. We will keep you posted about our experience. It's awesome!!!
Great people in this BTC-world.
CU all on 20th of March at the BB.

Well, this program was broadcasted bij National Radio I think, NOS... The number of  transactions at Bitcoin Boulevard is definitely higher than 3 in total per shop. It differs from shop to shop. The revenue was something between Euro 50,- and Euro 1500. You may say this is not mind-blowing, but still not bad I think. 
Let's see things in perspective. Thuisbezorgd.nl is a Dutch site where you can order takeaway food from over 5000 restaurants. Since a few months you can also pay with bitcoin, which is good news of course. I have heard however that only 0,04% of the payments is in bitcoin.
