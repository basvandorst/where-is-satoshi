The article is half true.  No bitcoins will be mined, but gadgets will come blockchain enabled. This is for Internet of Things.  Again - No bitcoins will be mined in IOT. IOT will use blochain concept for fully decentralized network of things.

Short summary of the article:
1) Back in 1980th Regan made an announcement on Strategic Defense Initiative - SDI in short.  Space based system of lasers that would shot down nuclear rockets.  
2) Russians quickly recognized (and mathematically proved) that if Russia and US would build such systems separately - those systems would inevitably destroy the wold.
3) Regan and Gorbachev met in Rekjavik to discuss how they could build space shield jointly.  But discussions fell through due to essentially lack of trust.
4) Later the this idea dropped out of political radar, as Regan got in trouble with Iran-Contras scandal, and Soviet Union began having their own issues.  Plus space laser technologies were rather technological bluff than reality, and Russians recognized that US did not have it.
4) The article further goes through the sequence of explanations, that today Laser technologies exist on both sides. First country that brings those technology into space will trigger the chain of events that will obliterate the world.  Not having them in the space is not an option ether, as the chance of unauthorized/unsanctioned nuclear launch has become reality.
5) The article then explains that Blockchain technologies are the only viable option to save the world from nuclear obliteration.  Countries would build truly joint space shield using blockchain technologies for joint control of the space laser weapons (using the concept of smart contracts).  On top of military space shield, the layer of commercial blockchain hardware will reside too, so it becomes intertwined.
6) Bottom line, this is the only viable option of saving the world from self obliteration.  And possibly that's what this technology was meant to be used for.  
7) Then the article goes into explaining various scenarios.

Yes, shale drilling - thanks for pointing out.  Shale drilling is "profitable" at $90 per barrel, per pundits.  Shale drilling is devastating to underground water supply.  Shale drilling is the major growth sector today, despite oil prices being below $90 , and slow down of entire economy.  
Combined with Easy Money Policy one has practically unlimited resources to redirect.  This process is also known, per Allen Greenspan, as "confiscation through Inflation". Example with shale drilling, at the time when it makes no economic sense is an excellent demonstration of it.

Even if that argument is right - financial privacy is long gone from today's system.  What difference does bitcoin make if it's fully transparent?  For a change all criminal activity will be traceable.  I personally do not care if the world knows how and how much I spend.    Its already out there on the "need to know" basis - what's the difference if my neighbor will know that too, and I will know about him?
Full financial transparency seem like a great self organizing tool for society.  Partial transparency breeds oppression, and creates room for abuse and crime.  That's my 2 cents.

excellent point.  We live in the state of "throw away" economy.  The model you describe, also puts economic incentives not to build cheap tools etc, but build durable ones, that everyone can use it.  I heard somewhere that average life use of drill is 15 min.  I other words consumer pays $200 for Devalt drill to use for 15 min.  There is no incentives for Devault to build quality drill, thus the heavy user gets taxed, and subsidies the rest of the production as he needs to buy drills more often.

I do not claim to know all the answers, but let's say securing the collateral, and taking part of the profit.  Not much different than what exists today.  I heard something similar actually exists in Islamic banking, where charging interest is big crime.  But again I am not an expert on Islamic banking, I do not know all the details.
The fundamental crime with existing system of charging the interest rate that entity in charge of printing money devaluates (and appropriates) the value one decided to store for future consumption.

If you know the (real) history, Vitalik is just a young kid, who was not even a programmer.  He stumbled into bitcoins, as a kid and began writing articles about it for the price of 5 bitcoin per article.  He was not even mining (in early days) as he did not have required skills.  Then something happened, and all of the sudden (practically overnight) media began spinning  his image as a "bitcoin/Blockchain genius"!  Yet, here is the problem - in software world one cannot bullshit his way into an expert (like in Finance). Any serious developer knows (and will tell) that in software world, wisdom comes with experience - and there is no magic or shortcut to it.  
Vitalik "mesmerize" his audience with "discoveries" (for the lack of better term) of the concepts that have been known in the industry for some time. 
Two things are going well for Vitalik (for now):
1) He has got surrounded by a lot of cash (translates into resources), and smart people.  That produced some synergy effect for him, and accelerated his development in the field of systems design (to a degree).
1) Serious heavy weight industry application developers are busy working, and did not get (yet) into the field of designing distributed/decentralized applications. Thus   It is easy to package  old concept dressed in the new clothing and make it sound like revolutionary idea, and not to be called for BS.
Combination of these thing currently allows Vitalik, to be hailed as genius for the very marginal intellectual contribution to the field of knowledge.  Venture guys love it and play into it. Hype is good for them. Hype translates for them into a lot of $$$.
But, if you actually look at the concept of Etherium, it is the system that replicates all the problems of the today's socio-economic system into the new digital medium, turning it into the platform of techno-slavery. 
Imagine that you transfer your business processes onto etherium, just to find out they are devaluing ether at the scale that impacts your bottom line.  This is no different than how Federal Reserve appropriates value today from value creating Economy, into the hands of few.  
Then, once critical mass of business is on Etherium platform, they really got all of us by the balls.  Nothing can stop them to ban one business, and allow another to flourish, and so on.  You will not be able to do anything but to comply, as the Etherium platform would be the only way to conduct business.
To all the "koo koo" investors, who are chasing the "profit".  You are digging your own grave yard, and the grave yard for your own children.  Wake up!

The word socialism is misconstrued and confused with totalitarianism in modern world.  There is nothing wrong with socialism (aka sharing, free, market economy)  Everything is wrong with totalitarianism - when way of life is imposed on us by small group of people called government structure.  We are heading to the Soviet Union 2.0 or a.k.a state of techno slavery if things do not get decentralized, or in other terms become more social.  socialism = social.
I found it that for the most people it is very hard to un-wire themselves from thinking that socialism = totalitarianism.  That is why I renamed the original article.

You have no clue, how irrelevant you are in the topic of decentralization.   You do not want bitcoin system to be anonymous - then open up your (banking) system! Make every bank transaction and every bank account transparent for public's view.  
If you are ready to get this done for the banking sector, you have my support for bitcoin sector.  The world will become a better place, if ALL transactions and business actions are transparent. In the world of full unconditional transparency you will not be able steal, bribe, and lie.

Just look at the voting score on this post (which is 0) and on your response.  Shills + Clueless users turned this sub into meaningless and sabotaging medium.
From technical prospective, Etherium's technical architecture mixes data layer with application layer, which is bad technical solution.  
Vitalik (with the help of his team) wrote this convoluted useless essay on private, semi-private, and public blockchains, when (experienced) Dev and Business community knew it long ago that data's user audience, defines the data's use (private, semi, or public) - plain and simple.  They also have this idea that smart contract is one layered entity - LOL. Sophisticated business knows it all well this is multi-layered entity.  
Also from business prospective - Etherium's ideas are kind of useless and predatory concepts. They hook users on Ethers, which they are at the liberty to devalue. Ironically (or on purpose) Ether is the type of gas used in hospital to sedate before the surgical procedure. 
They also control the API enviroment, which effectively can dictate (on meta level) what data can and cannot be accessed.  
This is very evil framework - designed to enslave through the use of the meta levels.  99% of the people (sheeple) have no clue how meta levels (and not the level in front of their nose) control the things they are allowed and not allowed to do. 
This is just an fyi.. ...take a look at this white paper:

No, I did not miss your point :).  In hypothetical scenario you explanation makes complete sense.  But in real case this is not what actually happened.  
Originally there was one document, and was only notarized once.  But for unexplained reasons (read: fraud) second version showed up in the system, and both documents were living in the system harmlessly until the legal issue came up, and the document got called for examination.  Then two versions of the documents showed up, materially contradicting each other (documents are not included here).
If we had decentralized system with crypto-signed solution, this would never happened, as it would have been caught up by the system right away.
So my point here - even notary public services is not safe anymore.  Companies went digital, and no company stores the paper version.  So in the digital world - which of these documents should be accepted as the original?  That is the fundamental problem of digitization without decentralization supported by crypto-signature.

I am bringing up public's attention! Nothing, absolutely nothing can be trusted in the centralized banking system!  Everything, literally everything us up for grab for fabrication.  Only decentralization and the use of crypto-signature is valid public proof.  Automation of trust through the crypto-signature is the only valid public proof.

My childhood was in the Soviet Union, and candies were often scares.  When the candy had to be split between two kids, this was exactly the way it was done.  One child takes initiative in breaking the candy in two equal parts (best to his ability) and another child gets to choose which part he takes.  
I recall deep sense of satisfaction from fairness of the process regardless whether I had to choose part, or divide the candy in pieces :)

yes, the cashier would have been checking it, if there was no assumed fungibility to the dollar.  The point I make that fungibility only applies to the physical representation of the dollar, and not to the value it represents.

Add on top of it sits the system of fractional reserve, where for every $1 deposited into the system(which was created out of thin air)  $10 gets created (again out of thin air) and retained by the banking sector.  So in other words you produce unit of goods, and exchange it for what you think is fair market value, the banking industry instantly creates 9 times of it in dollar equivalent, and retains it for its own consumption.  Effectively you are only getting 10% of what you created.  That's the system of fractional reserve!
Next time you walk by the branch and question "how can they afford all the advertisement of tennis players, and fancy branches and so on..." ...that is how they can afford - they will always be ahead of you (and me) 9 times as long as we use them with existing system.
Bitcoin stops that system cold :)  That's one of the point paper articulates.

No you are wrong, not doctors, but pharmaceutical industry and Insurance companies.  
They dictate the doctors how they must treat the patients.  
For example insurance policy would state - doctor will be reimbursed for only one patient's visit. What do you want doctors to do, if doctor's opinion that you need to come twice a month, but he knows you do not have resources to cover? 
Or even worse - patient must buy 3 month supply of medicine to be covered under insurance, otherwise it is out of pocket expense.  If you are the doctor and you have suicidal patient on anti-depressants, its huge disservice to the patients and huge liability to the doctors.  Pharma and Insurance is off the hook!  They got their money.  
If you are patient, and you lost your supply - too bad, go and buy it again, but at your own expense.
But system does not care, they need profits, and the "optimization" of supply chain (at your and doctor's expense).  They also conduct actuarial studies and build business models that allow them to profit from you being "sloppy" patient.  The system "loves" to work with patients with psychiatric disorders - those are the most "sloppy" ones.

re: Mass Adopting.  We do not need mass adopting to go to the moon.  Look at current fluctuations.  This is direct indication that  the volume of bitcoins avail for trading is extremely thin.  I am guessing less than 50 million USD moving markets wildly.  Every time price moves up, new entrants are coming in... some will hold and some will trade. 
I believe we will see 10k pop by the end of this year.  No special analysis - purely based on feelings.  Call it fear of losing value, or call it greed, people will start jumping on it. The craziest part, we do not need much to move the market especially with few days left to halving :)
re: killer app - it's coming in a big way.  Very many of the client/server apps/processes will get replaced with new way of doing business.  Biggest value proposition of the new stuff, it does not need the be controlled for the trust.  Old stuff does.  That's what people and businesses yet come to realize.  Corporations spend 50-70% of resources on process control - bitcoin based processes remove these costs.  The challenge we face is to actually to design these processes, and here true engineering and business analysis power is required.  Most of corp business layer is not very creative, or able to really invent things they have not seen before.  But it will happen, and is already happening. 
re: ETH - Etherium in its current implementation has all the predatory mechanisms the current system carries.  If Etherium business model prevails we will end up in crypto-slavery, not crypto-freedom.

I am past believing, I am convinced USD is doomed, and I speak it from position of research.  Dollar will not be doing "just fine" in the next 10 years - not a chance.  Consider this:  world GDP is estimated to be about 70 trillion USD, and derivatives market alone estimated to be 700 trillion to 1.2 quadrillion USD.  That's 10 to 20 times of GDB, and that's just one market of derivatives.   And this is just one tiny fact - there are all kinds of other trends (such as death of petro dollar, etc.) and facts.  The king is naked - everyone is waiting for the boy to scream it.
This is all public information.  Everyone is aware that the dollar is dead the way we know it. The world right now is just simply figuring out how to get out of this mess with least numbe of economic casualties.

I do not know how you formed this opinion of Doctors, I respectfully and completely disagree with you.  You may not have the full picture how the system of reimbursements work in medical field, and thus you jump into conclusion - "It's a doctor's fault".  
Doctors are as much victims here as patients.  System cannot dictate (and not capable of assessing) how much care each individual should receive - that's the bottom line.  Also when system is wrong, it sets the precedent for a "weak, or call it bad" doctor to start breaking the "laws".  Statistically, he would not have done it, if the system would have been more dignifying. This is how the vicious cycle starts. 
Re: AA, his point totally makes sense.  The whole confidentiality thing customer vs. bank balance of power in today's world is placed on its head.

No,  I am not saying $50mln will move price to 10k, not at all.  All I am saying that at this specific point $50mln are making the market move in both directions, because trading volume is very thin, and it's about to get even more thin.
That is not to say that $50mln will bring the price to $10k.  I view the process as Yo-yo that with every bounce up and down it sucks in more capital. Some capital stays, and some capital trades.  Also,  $140 bln sounds like a big number, but in reality to make to that number we may only need actual $5-$10 bln to move in.  And because of the thin trading volume the market cap will move up. (And you see right away the whole hypocrisy of the market cap measure nonsense,  someone's else 25 cents turned into $10k, but he has not even traded :) What does it really mean market cap?  It's only true for the first guy to sell at that price :)  ) 
The challenge with corporate investing is such, that no one wants to be the last guy holding at the full price.  Corp investments all too comfortable in making $$ without any investment risk involved (naked short, LIBOR collusion, front running, etc.)  Bitcoin is an honest money, and in order to make money you have to risk money.  They do not like this, and that is why the will not move into it until something big collapses, and will affect their ability to operate in old ways
re: use cases for Blockchain.  Blockchain is just a fancy word for distributed database.  It's not right way to think that blockchain is "intranet" and bitcoin is "internet".  In Bitcoin solution the Blockchain is underlying database (internet version).  The same is true for non-Bitcoin solution, the (different) Blockchain is still underlying database (intranet version).  So when I say blockchain, I mean both Bitcoin and non-bitcoin version.  For example I have solution for policy administration platform for Insurance, that is using the "blockchain".  The architecture is actually blockchain agnostic - you can connect the platform to internal blockchain or external one, does not matter to the platform.  It's business choice where they want to store data, and what type of data, and in what format. (I am sure you understand the difference, but I felt the need to explain myself, so that I am not misunderstood)
re: Etherium - in short, they are printing ethers out of thin air (devaluing without hard stop).  So if you are early adopter, they will steal value of you taking the risk, by devaluing your holdings.  Your only bet is on crowd effect, the value of which they will also partially steal from you via devaluation.  They are super expensive model to operate smart contracts, they can change rule of platform at one's will.  You can build your whole business model using existing platform assumptions, and then the platform will change the assumptions you made. That's the danger of the platform in general. Its a long and deep discussion, why their business model is fundamentally based on principles of slavery, similar to how our modern financial system is built.  And my big argument is, that the game of slavery by means of financial manipulation is over.  We are entering into the new era, where we have narrow window of opportunity to create eco-system platform that is equitable and fair and prosperous for the human kind, or another kind (etherium kind) that will promote the techno-slavery of human kind.

I am big believer that even if, let's say, there will be technical issue with the software, it will be much easier to fix, then, let's say there is a discovered problem with Authority, in which everyone needs to trust to operate.  The problem of "fixing" the Authority is much harder to overcome, than the problem of fixing the software.
That's where my basis lays in the trust of the power of the masses, and as result in the power of bitcoins.

Acting illegal in banking industry is highly profitable.  You pay $185 million in penalties, you generate $1 billion in illegal profits you net $825 million.  And you move onto the next big thing. 
As long as industry will continue to be motivated by profits - Business Honesty and Integrity are the concepts for the losers, those who "cannot make it" 
On the separate note: the US Prison system has more inmates that Soviet Union in the days of Stalin.  US alone has 5 times more prisoners than China.  None of those prisoners are bankers, and there would be no spot in jail for Hillary - for obvious reasons.

I get your point.  But I believe that its very debatable, that without systemic advantage ingenuity of some can always outperform the others.  When the rules of the game are not rigged, then on average, on the large scale, over significant period of time, everyone does about the same.  There will be geniuses, and the lucky ones, but over period of time the nature seem to balance everything out. (and that's the genious of the Bitcoin and the "invisible hand")
The very presence of the scenario where one group outperforms another group at all the time, is an indication that the system is rigged to benefit that group.
The alternative scenario is that Hitler was right. That there will be always a certain group (based on the race or not) that will be genetically more superior to another group.  The nature suggests this is not the case.
@_date: 2016-09-08 07:52:25
The coinbase is missing major two points:
1) This innovations is not about technological platform - its about DECENTRALIZATION OF CONTROL, which will have huge socio-economic impact, impossible to achieve with centralized system of governance and socio-economic control.
2) This innovation is not about open financial system (controlled by few) - its about DECENTRALIZATION OF CONTROL of financial system.  
Here is the link to the white paper: Read at least page 6 -9 if you do not want to read full paper.
Etherium is anti-bitcoin platform.  If adapted widespread (as is) Etherium will lead society to techno slavery (Soviet Union 2.0)!  Do not develop on Etherium!  You have been warned!
1) Etherium devalues ethers - just like fiat.
2) Etherium is the platform.  If the platform does not like you - platform kicks you out, destroys your business model, takes it away, etc. etc. etc.
Read the paper - understand the point!  There is a lot more at stake than just "better way of doing it".
Only full decentralization will provide equitable and fair ecosystem.

IMPORTANT:  I AM RE POSTING THIS RESPONSE FROM THREAD ABOVE.
Old Money vs. New Money is very well established concept in financial mathematics. The practical application of this concept is also known as LIFO and FIFO principles. The reason why person without right background gets confused is exactly because one of the most "vicious" properties of money called *fungibility*. Fungibility makes every dollar to be exactly the same as the "other" dollar, and camouflages the principle of "Old Money vs. New Money" which is the **property of the function of the money** (not to be confused with property of money).
This concept is well established and widely used by financial companies for surrender charge rules, for example. Financial product may have vesting schedule associated with each deposit for the purpose of surrender. For example 5 year old deposit may have 0% surrender fee and 1 year old deposit may carry 5% surrender fee. If customer makes multiple deposits over 5 year period and then makes one withdrawal that depletes several of these deposits, company may apply FIFO or LIFO rule and start calculating surrender charges for each deposit based on its vested schedule. 
This is exactly the scenario where 5 year old dollar is given back to you at full value, and 1 year old dollar is given back at 95 cents, because financial company is smart and knows the principle I am describing.
It is easy to dupe consumer because **fungibility property of money camouflages the principle of "Old Money vs New Money"** and because consumers naturally think about money in declarative terms as opposite to procedural.
Imagine for a second, if each dollar bill had printed time stamp on it. Then it would be super easy to calculate today's value of each bill by simply discounting its value by historical interest rate and derive to today's value of that bill. If that bill's value does not correspond to the spot market value, then it is indication that something went wrong with either historically declared interest rates or spot market value. However, if you erase that time stamp from each dollar bill - you have no mechanism to check historical interest rates against declared market value of dollar today.
I assume you can see now, how Bitcoin offers elegant solution to such problem :)
When there is no transparency and control mechanisms - the temptation for abuse and corruption starts crippling into the system. Over time corruption breeds corruption, abuse breeds abuse, and spiral goes down to all valleys of society. One day we wake up and we realize we do not live in the world we used to know, and we do not know why it happened.
People do not realize it yet, how immensely powerful the concept of Bitcoin is, and in how many different ways Bitcoin principle will change our perception of finance, governance, and the world in general.
You will not take me seriously today, if I tell you that the most fundamental principles of finance, time value of money, and theory of interest will get serious scrutiny and review from economists and scholars in the very near time. Yet mark my word there will be noble prize awarded for re-work of concepts in this area. Principle of bitcoin will soon change perception of finance and economics in a very fundamental ways.
Support my work if you find this to be  important  :)

Lol - good one re: museum.
On more serious note, I surely hope Bitcoin succeeds as currency, and on much broader level as decentralization mechanism.  World will be much more sustainable place to live in.  I support Bitcoin out of self preservation, and preservation for my children and mankind.  Bitcoin and its concept fits well into my system of believes that promote piece, happiness, and wellness :)
If price drops again, I will continue buying with what I can afford to lose completely.  If I end up being super rich as result of my "stupidity" - i promise to give it back to the world.

Newly printed dollars dilute the value of all dollars in circulation, but not right away - and this is the most important key.  That extra printed dollar needs to get recognized by economy, and this becomes a multi-step process.  One who is at the starting point of that process, benefits a lot more than one who is in the middle of that process sinse half prices already adjusted and half still did not.  One who is at the very end of this process does not get any extra value out of it.  But whatever assets he had just got depleted via price increase.  
By this mechanism if you mark all the dollars with distinct number then the older the dollar, the less of money it has.  But because of fungibility of dollar - every dollar is the same - that effect is being masked, and it becomes confusing.

I am missing the point: Why they cannot fund anything?  They can borrow from the public, as opposite of borrowing from the FED who creates money out of thin air, which is effectively taxation through inflation of the guy on the bottom.  The guy at the top gets the full benefit of value of the dollar at the old price, thus always having competitive advantage at expense of the rest, and regardless if market is up or down

That's exactly my point.  People do not realize that newly printed dollar at the top is worth a lot more than the same dollar once it trickles down to the bottom.  
Inflation has propagation speed. In other words newly printed dollar has full value when used in first purchase.  When it is used in second purchase, it has a bit less of value, because market has recognized the existence of newly printed dollar, and adjusted the price. When dollar gets to the bottom, at the wager's level, the devaluation is fully materialized.  Wagers are too late to get onto the market with their dollars.  Prices have been adjusted fully.

Agree on most and disagree on one.
Bitcoin removes a mechanism of wealth transfer to the top via "taxation through inflation".  That's a very powerful on its own, at it depletes the spender from replenishing funds at expense of the rest. Thus, per Pikkety, and per theory of probability, over time wealth will be more evenly distributed. 
No more top heavy - but you are right it will take looooong time.

I hear your point re: individual choice on what taxes should be covering, but I do not think comparing choice of going to war to healthcare debate would be good example for debate.  War brings no benefit to the most, and healthcare is form of benefit - thus debate is whether we should or should not have the benefit.
But I understand your comment, and it goes to the heart of "no taxation without representation".  I hope with mesh network form of governance and bitcoin as form voting by paying mechanism, we can get to the point where those who don't want health care do not need to pay for it, with consequences attached, of course.

Regulation will come, whether we want this or not.  This is the time to get engaged.  This is the time to present our facts, and use public forum for educating the public and regulators.  Right now bitcoin coverage media has been hijacked by "bad-news" reporters.  We need to turn this around.  Regular folks think bitcoin is a tool for criminal activity. And this is exactly what parties with vested interests want them to think, I would speculate. We need to combat this with facts, we need to combat this with right media coverage.  We need to document Bitcoin's mission statement, define Bitcoin's vision, form strategy and follow with plan of actions.  Only then those "bad-news" reporters will stop having impact on the image of bitcoin.  Thanks for the support!  Next write up update is coming shortly.  Will have more material in it!

I think i followed your argument in first paragraph.  But I am completely lost in what is the logical argument of second paragraph.
First, we are talking here about mega-trends, not micro-events.  Second, If the biggest printer in the world does not "play nice" who is there to tell that printer "you will go Zimbabwe path?"  
Instead, we (the aggregate) try to suck it up with least damage to ourrself.  There are really two options available for carrying the value through the time: first - keep it in cash and suffer full consequences, or move to debt - and thus negate some of the consequences.
That's what I think is happening.  It seem that on macro level the faith in cash is so lost, that macro players would rather to lend at negative interest rate, than keeping it "safe" in cash on the sidelines.  That is indication of serious systemic dis balance that starts manifesting itself in the loss of faith.  Loss of faith is a lot more serious problem than any systemic or non-systemic dis-balance.

Half True statement.  IBM only! used Etherium for proof of concept in dishwasher use case.  In ADEPT white paper IBM clearly stated that etherium is just one of! the tools, and at the end it may or may not be etherium.
Personally, very sceptical of Etherium's wide reach of claims.  I architected systems and parts of systems from scratch for Insurance and Financial Services.  I know first hands how complicated it can get to design what seem to be simple workflow with simple business processes, or define the right data structure.  Deep (very deep) subject matter expertise is required to lay out the right ground.
Vitalik's Buterin's blog post on private, public, and semi-private blockchains sound very naive - as if a child just made a discovery that the world is not flat :).  For any experienced architect it is basic knowledge that how data used  defines the data structure and the level of data access - plain and simple :)   No need for silly write up of the obvious :)
Etherium's claim that they can do "all of it" sounds more like statement of charlatan :)

Bank accounts are not designed for storage of value as their primary function and therefore they do not have such features built in.  
Investment accounts accounts on another hand designed exactly for that.  Therefore, If you buy B shares of mutual fund, or units of Variable Annuity as an example, they carry exactly the surrender scenario I described. 
As a side comment: 
The challenge of democracy is that people without knowledge have equal rights to vote on issue they do not have needed level of expertise, and often vote turns into a beauty contest :)  That is the biggest threat to the democratic principle of Bitcoin.  
The biggest achievement of Bitcoin system to date, it figured out how to break economy of scale of one's ability to take advantage of lack of  knowledge of complex issues by many.  One can simply use bitcoins without understanding the whole complexity behind, and what a wonderful things he does for society as whole, by simply being part of bitcoin network.
The next step for bitcoin, is to figure out how not to be held back by the weakest link in the chain.  And I think the answer for this is in Mesh Network.

Agreed, not only central bank creates money, but it does not change the argument as you pointed out in the next statement.


In most simple terms debt = money is slavery! You do have personal freedom with your body, but that's about where it ends. Anything extra - food, shelter etc, involves money, which equals debt!  In other words I pay you for the labor, but then I turn around and I take it away from you in small portions.  And you would seem ok, with it.  If that is ok, with you, then the next question who has the rights to take stuff away from you?  Why those and not others?  How much they have the rights to take away from you? At what point you feel it is unfair?  
I hope I illustrated with my questions that such attitude becomes a slave's mentality, and prone for exploitation.  If we as society are ok with this - then we just need to accept that we live in the society with financial form of slavery.  Make it super clear for ourselves and everyone else, and move on with our business, and stop ridiculing ourselves with concepts of freedom and liberty.  If that's the case, then that's the case! 
@_date: 2015-04-03 16:05:10
Let me try to explain it differently: Every newly printed dollar dilutes the value of all dollars in circulation.  Yet, the key is it does not happen instantaneously - it need to propagate through the system for all price changes to take effect.  Ones who have that extra dollar ready to spend first, will buy more with it (using old prices), than those who will get that extra dollar (via salary increase) after all prices already adjusted.  
If you have single source of printing (FED) then you get nice trickle down pyramid of passing that diminishing extra value from the top to the bottom.
With Bitcoin you have arguably thousands of sources - thus arguably thousands of pyramids, which for the sake of aggregate analysis approximates to uniform layer feeding the ecosystem with newly printed coins.
Plus with bitcoins, printing is necessity of propagating bitcoins into eco-system.  Eventually it will stop.  With dollars it will not. 
  
@_date: 2015-04-04 15:55:35


The differences are the following: 
For FED vs. blockchain reward formula:
FED has two roles to play -  FED authorize and FED issues currencies. In bitcoin world those roles are separated - blockchain formula plays only role of authorization and Miners issue currencies in exchange for significant resources.  FED can flood the system with cash tomorrow without any resources involved.  Miners cannot - blockchain formula authorizes printing at pre-defined rate and only in exchange for significant amount of resources.  
**QUESTION: Even with the system of checks and balances in place, which system is prone to more human mistake and abuse?**     
FOR DOLLARS:
FED will inject cash via established distribution channels. The order of participants in the distribution channel will always remain the same. As newly printed cash trickles down through system it creates wave of price increase. Getting cash and spending! right before the wave of price increase gives business real competitive advantage.  Wave of price increase has has speed, power of impact, and direction.  All three, speed, power of impact, and direction, can be manipulated via legislative mechanisms that I will talk about in the next draft I plan to release shortly.  
FOR BITCOIN:
Bitcoin network will inject currency via eco-system of miners in connection with multiple distribution channels created by market forces.  This means the impact created by newly printed currencies is more reflective of market forces than in the case of centralized distribution.  There will be multiple epicenters of waves of impact, therefore creating more leveled impact on distribution overall.  Such system significantly diminishes the benefit of being first in line in getting the coin, and thus removes from the system the very reason for abuse and corruption. 
This is an example how changing the system design eliminates from the system itself element of corruption and mechanism for abuse :)
I do not claim bitcoin will resolve all world problems - but this is an example, and big one, how the system can be improved by removing from the system the essence of temptation for abuse and corruption. My paper plans to draw more macro-examples like this one, so feel free to support my effort :)  
Next draft with more info is coming out shortly.

If one controls the world then the form of governance is called Totalitarianism, regardless of the form of Economy (capitalism or socialism) 
The form of economy and the form of governance are two completely different things and the Western civilization is brainwashed into getting confused about it.  To make it short: Totalitarianism is form of governance, and Socialism is form of economic activity.  Still confused about socialism?  Let's call it shared economy. Yay!  We love shared economy, but we hate socialism - what an illiterate idiocy! 
Crypto-Socialism is effectively shared economy without centralized dedicated governance.  Because crypto automates the role of center and distributes through the network. Call it crypto-democracy.  I call it crypto-socialism.

I believe too and that is what the white paper argues.  With the introduction of the concept of distributed trust, the means of productions have changed dramatically.  The technical concept of trust got created.  There is no longer a need and justification for a function of centralized authority when the function of trust can be simply automated.
And that changes things dramatically!  Money is the most basic change.  Money will turn from debt based instrument to an equity based instrument - that's what bitcoin is. Bitcoin converts contract and money into one entity - there is no money without contract, as there is no contract without money!  Instead of banks, value producers will be "creating" money, that are backed by the real assets, or revenue generating activities, and not the BS system of Fractional reserve that benefits the bank at expense of everyone else. 
After that, with the disappearance of need for centralized authority, and with disappearance of the authorities abilities to earn abnormal returns at expense of everyone,  the respect for authority will disappear too.  This alone will fix a lot of socio-economic problems. It will become much harder, if not impossible for one group to exploit another.
This all can happen if the technology gets applied in the right way.  However if the platforms like Etherim prevail instead, then society is screwed in a major way.  It will become complete slavery - Soviet Union 2.0

re: " Dollars themselves are equal opportunity pieces of paper, whoever holds them has the same purchasing power be they male or female, black or white..."
It's not about who holds the dollar, its about when each person gets it.  In other words people on the top, get newly printed fiat faster than people on the bottom. By the time people on the bottom get the dollar, it's been fully devalued already, and person at the top has system built in opportunity to always buy more with his dollar than person on the bottom.  That's what that phrase suppose to mean.  Thanks for pointing out, I will try to rephrase it better.
Update: and decentralized form of creating money provides permanent fix to that issue.  Yes, early adapter still gets rewarded, but the main difference is that anyone can be early adapter.  With current system you cannot ask FED to pass on you that extra value you get from appreciation of real asset when FED injects next batch of QE into the system.

No offence, you have no ability to analyze things.  You totally missed the point with the nonsense of the employment. You argue as if there is economy on one side and federal reserve on the other. In terms of employment FED is part of GDP, and employment expense has nothing to do with this argument.  The entire argument is built around comparing rate of growth Debt and rate of growth of Economy.   Because the way the system is set up, the rate of growth of debt will allays be faster, than the rate of growth of the economy.  Plus economy will never have enough of money regardless of rate of its growth!
Do not bother with the answer, if you still did not get this part.

The hypothetical scenario states there is only $100 of currencies in economy.  Does not matter if you produce 100 bushels of grain or 10,000.  There is still $100 in economy.  Where were will you get additional $900 of currencies, or even $3 to repay the loan?
Again!  You can produce as much as you want but economy has only $100 to account for entire production. And if you need extra $3, you need to borrow it again.

Look, I am not even touching here on the scam of system of fractional reserve.  And I am well aware of the studies that banks are not intermediaries - they simply create debt out of thin air (just like central banks with some constraints).
I do not even go there, and complicate the argument with extra layers of complexity when the very fundamental assumptions of the system perpetuity fails to conform to a common sense.
I do agree with this point:


As per 1977 Federal Reserve mandate to maintain stable prices, and maximum employment rate, and moderate long term interest rates.... ...based on this graph alone we are at the doorsteps of huge uptick in demand for employment, unprecedented period of price stabitity, and the period of very moderate interest rates.

Actually the hollistic definition of socialism comes from word social, or communal.  Historically there was no way of managing communal interests (a.k.a. public domain) except with the government (a.k.a. command economy)  Crypto-technology changes the game.

Now IMF says, you can hold either US dollars or Chinese remnibi.  You, the Russia, have economic reasons not to like US dollars, but like remnibi instead. You will replace US dollars with Chinese remnibi and will continue to trade with  Europe, and stay compliant with IMF requirements.  If enough countries do that, which is expected, you will have devaluation of the dollar as result.

Socialism – A political and economic theory of social organization that advocates that the means of production, distribution, and exchange should be owned or regulated by the community as a whole. 
Totalitarianisms – Of or relating to a system of government that is centralized and dictatorial and requires complete subservience to the state.
Crypto-Socialism – ???

Then I copy (cut and paste) the private key into Wallet Details field, the newly generated codes are still give the same error in breadwallet (again empty transaction)  What the hell?

You are missing the point here - the promise to pay can be cooked - in fact for any reason.  But to generate pressure on the price cannot be cooked without actually selling the bitcoin.  In stock market you can flood the market with fake claims that you are selling stock you do not own, (exploit of old rule that you can settle the trade with physical stock in 3 days).  You bring the price down, and buy stock back within 3 days, you reached your goal.  
Again - while exchange can screw the customer in many many ways, they cannot fake the pressure on the bitcoin price unless they really sell it.  Of course Exchange collusion can take place, and they will achieve the same goal.  Yet the more exchanges will come up to the market, the more difficult it will become to collude.

Thanks for the comment.  In fact this is not uncommon for public to confuse socialism as form of economic relations, with totalitarianism, as form of governance.  Even Meriam-Webster dictionary makes this mistake.  It equates the collective (self-elected) and the governmental (centrally imposed) forms of relations, which I distinctly separate in my paper.  
Oxford Dictionary presents more classical, and more correct definition of Socialism.  This is why I elected to use the Oxford's version, which (I am very glad) triggered your question. 
I added the definition of Totalitarianism next to Socialism to draw attention to this common misconception. 
As one can see, that even very developed countries that practice  Capitalism, can be governed as Totalitarian State. 
Soviet Union was criticized for running wide spread prison system called "Goulag."    The aggregate number of prisoners was used as an indicator representing the oppressive nature of the state. 
If we are to apply the same argument today, then please take a look at the prisoner's population broken down by countries. 
I am not here to advocate, one side or another, I am simply here to point to the facts, and just like everyone else, trying to interpret them.
As I argue in the paper, it is the very removal of centralized governance or a.k.a. "elected official's dilemma" will lead to the next qualitative jump in the socio-economic development of the society.  I call it "Crypto-Socialism" - a form of shared economy without centralized control.

I am with you on this point!  When exchange is centralized, then Exchange can fake any price they want, by faking supply and demand.  Mt. Gox is the very example of it.
Yet, the more exchages we have, the more difficult it becomes to coordinate the faking of the price among all of them.  So my point is, in the perfect world where we have very many bitcoin exchanges (hopefully we get there soon), the only way to pressure the price down is to sell what you have, as opposite to the stock market where you can sell what you do not have and get away with it, regardless the number of exchanges you put in place.
The reason is because trade and settlement in stock market are two different transaction - trade is instant, and settlement is later.  In Bitcoin trade and settlement is at the same time - you cannot fake the naked short.  Yet your point on price faking is still valid, but its done by different mechanisms, which are easier to catch and expose than fake trades.  
- these are my 2 cents.

Second bullet point on the paper:
* Money creation in practice differs from some popular misconceptions — banks do not act simply as intermediaries, lending out deposits that savers place with them, and nor do they ‘multiply up’ central bank money to create new loans and deposits.
This is side effect of multi year of brainwashing where even subject matter experts lost their ability to think critically.
@_date: 2015-10-15 13:37:07
your point is well taken - shorting will put the break on price explosion.  I would agree with you if we talk about stock market where day does not go without naked shorts.  The beauty of bitcoin - there is no naked shorts - cannot cook them - period :).
So when the greed kicks in, we will see the price will fly up again.  Yet, once it flies up, it will also come down, but not because of shorting, but because of thin trade volume, which makes it easy to manipulate with deep enough pockets.

Please stop fascinating yourself with measuring Bitcoin in USD.  All fiat (including USD) are printed out of thin! air.  How many air vesicles does one bitcoin cost?  Who cares!  Air is scarcity free resource, bitcoin is not.
A lot more exiting measure is how many goods, services, people, businesses, business transactions, etc are using bitcoins.  That's the most fascinating question.  
The fiat is the way of the past.  Just get used to this notion please.  Recall the Pilgrims amusement when they saw Indians using sea shells to measure wealth.

Yes, Etherium is fully controlled and centralized on the level of platform, and lures its victims by offering "convenience" (a.k.a. putting you asleep), in exchange for the right to castrate your business (a.k.a. appropriating the participant's value by means of devaluation, or by means of changing the rules of the game).

Interesting twist. First the government sponsors terrorism in the form of rebels, freedom fighters, (Afganistan, Syriya, Libiya, etc.)  and then they turn it against their own citizens.
If the government itself, and not the citizens, are sponsoring the terrorism - why the citizens need to report their holdings to the government?  
Plain and simple fact. Citizens never have agenda, or resources to sponsor terrorism! Only those who fight for power and control, for the right to create money out of thin air, have the agenda and the resources! to sponsor  terror.
Wake up citizens around the globe if you have any sense of critical thinking left within yourself.  
If you wants to move gold, silver, diamonds, or any other shit across the globe, you should have the right to remain secretive about it. You start reporting it   - you will paint the target on your back.  You are not advertising the place of your storage, why do you need to advertise the date and the itinerary of moving it? 
The right for to remain secretive is first and foremost right of each individual for the sake of his personal safety.   No police cannot provide you with the safety of not to be robbed - its a fact of life. 
Edit: When Vladimir Putin asked Fidel Castro how he was able to survive hundreds of assassination attempts, Fidel responded - you take control of your own security.
