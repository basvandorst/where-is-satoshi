In this case it's not really about bitcoin, the problem is how the old man's money disappears and, in the future, is spent by the heir. They could do it in cash and the same thing would happen, the problem is the absence of a source of income and all the dots waiting to be joined.
There is also a big difference between the taxes for a few small transactions you may forget and an inheritance, the legal and financial implications of being caught are very different.

People is tipping very few Doges all the time, I think it is because many of them have mined the Doges themselves with their CPU or GPU and are poor shibes. Also because some users tip lots of comments and only a few can go around tipping 1000 Doges.

Bad shibe. Bad

    Such meaning
                   Work hard
                                                 wow
So serious
Note: I have never tipped anyone bitcoins nor dogecoins, it was just a friendly explanation of what's going on. And talking about meaning, to me, that display of arrogance means more than $3.50.

I guess that's the point, there are many different populations and cities where different measures can work.

Yes, because their loved ones will get fucked by the government if he doesn't.

They allow you to defend yourself they just stop the arms race as close to the bottom as they can and choose who can be a step ahead.
That together with a good penal code makes having a gun not worth it for most criminals. The end result is that criminals and people defending themselves use knives, pepper sprays and maybe a taser that even when they are illegal can only get you a fine if a cop has a bad day. Usually just fists.

I will feel a lot safer if next time I enter a discotheque random people have AK's for self-defense.
I trust the police and Intelligence to deal with terrorists. They've done a great job even if the result is not always perfect.
If I were so scared about criminals and terrorists I would stop going to crowded places or I don't know, maybe join the army.

Crime rate says otherwise, most of them probably care about breaking the law a lot more than I do in case of self-defense. A convicted criminal with a gun or a large knife goes back to prison, I wouldn't.

It's an alternative formulation, the value is linearly related to the number of possible connections and the limitation he addresses is well known. 
The problem is that he simplifies when he doesn't talk about value and again when he assumes that a limitation in a law that explains one aspect of the Internet growth will kill it.

They are asymptotically equivalent and not proportional because of that  - 1 but it's quite a minor formal detail and I think it's unreasonable to expect more precision when it will only make it harder to follow for many readers and it's an informally accepted use of the word.

What's nonsensical? Here is your simple combinatorics problem n(n − 1)/2 quite proportional to the square of n if you ask me.
