The best recommend way to go about this is, save the website (Right click &gt; save as) and load a bootable copy of linux on a machine that's disconnected from the internet.  Load the page on that machine and generate / print the paper wallets.  Spread the bitcoins out between different paper wallets so all of them aren't in the same one.  Hell, if you get 100 BTC, print out 20 paper wallets with 5 BTC on each.

Around a 10% reduction in prices (seems to be the going rate) and I would tip of course.


None that I know of in Austin!


Sure would.  I love local farmers market stuff.


No idea. =\


If you partake in a farmers market, put a little sign on your booth that says "I accept bitcoins, ask me about them!"  Also, put the same sign on the back of your taxi seats so the passengers know about it.  You could also have a magnet decal for the door made that just has the BTC logo on it.

Alrighty, I'll give ya the rundown!  First you need to [click this]( and that has all the documentation for the bitcointip bot.  But I'll walk ya through it so it's easier!
* If you haven't already, [accept the tip](  
* [Next you can withdraw the bitcoins to your own private wallet if you'd like](  
* If you'd like to keep the bitcoins on the tip bot, in case you want to tip someone later on, you can just leave them be and start tipping. 
* Otherwise if you would like the bitcoins stored in a blockchain.info wallet where you can easily send them off and have access to them at all times, [you'll want to click this link]( and follow the instructions.  That will create a new wallet for you on blockchain.info.  You'll want to write down/save the walled ID/Password.
* Alternatively if you'd like to deposit more bitcoins into the bot, [you will want to click this link]( to get your balance which will have your bitcoin address in the message.  At this point you'll want to send however many bitcoins you would like into that address to be loaded onto the bitcointip bot.  If you created the wallet in the previous step, you will want to send the bitcoins to the address on the blockchain.info account.
If you have any other questions, just ask!**

Why did it take over 32,000 blocks before the difficulty went from 1 to 1.182?
@_date: 2013-03-08 19:25:10
I get that, but if they get stolen, they aren't recoverable.  So whether you know right away or a month later when you decide to check it, it wouldn't make a difference.

Type the address into blockchain to check the funds.  Use the private key that was generated when you created it to import the key into another wallet to spend the funds.
