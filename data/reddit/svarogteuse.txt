What makes you think I know anything about IRS code?

Thats not what the Constitution says. It says:




That does not give Congress an exclusive right to coin. Just the right to. Remember in the founders eyes any power not explicitly granted to the  Federal government is reserved for the states so Congress had to be give the power to coin money.
Further down in Section 10:


That limits the states. It forbids them from coining money (which Congress can do). 
Thats all that is addressed by the Constitution. No where does it forbid an entity other than a state from coining money.

We have clearly already interpreted that clause to include paper money which is no longer backed by either gold or silver. I see no reason they can't not open it further to strictly digital currency.
