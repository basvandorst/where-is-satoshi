It seems i may have lost it... it isnt in my email anymore but i received an email saying that if it doesn't go through to contact support and they will push it or something like that... i'm going to keep looking through my email but i can provide any other information for it, i have 2 emails from zipzap that the orders were successful to the 2 different account numbers i sent to and i have the original transaction info possibly including my 2 receipts.  
Is it not possible to just look at my wallet address and see that 2 payments were requested/payed for that day?

Had a slight problem with a transaction recently, its been 2 days and haven't received my funds yet...  I don't blame bitinstant so much because i put in two orders for the same amount about an hour apart. I must say though, Seth from support must have not read what i said in the support request. I  
explained that i sent two orders and eventually got to that i didn't get the second (I admit i overexplained the situation) but his support answer was along the lines of "looks fine to me" :/ I could have choked him through the screen to say the least (not to mention that was my second support request) 
Anyway, it would be great if this could be resolved and i will add that bitinstant has been rock solid for me with all previous transactions.

*i beleive that the order above is the one that didn't go through, but my wallet has that amount going to my wallet from the previous transaction. Please look at my actual order and that i payed twice to two different accounts

is there a way to find out my order number? its not in the emails sent to me... i also realized that the support email that was sent to me before with my order id was from a transaction i put through 9 days ago so i actually didn't receive an email but just for reference the id was b9f0c222-8ef9-4eec-9f09-9a2378d704fa

Thanks for the answers!
It Seems legitimate right now with some transfers going through, but not at all user friendly or convenient.  I also found this little post in addition to what jenya put up.
 
I guess it would be best to wait for them to fix all of their kinks and establish themselves if they don't get shot down for legal reasons.
