Correct me if I'm wrong in my assessment: you want to buy bitcoin on the low and when the price goes up you want to go shopping. You think you'll be saving $$$ this way.

Lucky! I bought at $1000.
@_date: 2014-10-06 04:17:12
Well that sucks.

It depends. What's your reason for buying bitcoin? Do you think it's the revolutionary digital currency of the future or are you making an investment in it hoping to sell it off in the future for a profit?

One and a half. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 04:23:57
That's risky. Obviously you want to buy low and hope that the price turns around quickly enough for you to buy things. Ideally you're only buying in amounts you can stand to lose and want to purchase things that are not necessities. 
It all comes down what you think the future of bitcoin will be. Do you think the price will eventually go back up? Do you think there is going to be mass adoption soon? 
Whether it's gambling or investing never put in more money than you can afford to lose.

OP what's your selling strategy going to be like? I think you mentioned that you're going to sell some off at $300 but since the price is constantly changing how are you going to lock the price at $300 and sell them? Can you place limit orders for bitcoin?

An incisive observation good sir. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:04:15
Thanks for the clarification. Is there recourse available in such a case? Like if my credit card was stolen and the thief maxes it out I can call the CC company and inform them of the theft and they won't hold me accountable for the charges.

What about the biggest crooks of them all? The government. When a large bitcoin purchase is made are the exchanges required to report to the government like banks do when large cash deposits are made? Even though bitcoin is decentralized i know there was government concern that it can/is/was being used for money laundering. So I'm wondering if the exchanges now report to the irs/fbi/treasury.

Same here. To the moon brotha, to the moon :'(

You could be wrong or you could be right. That's the exciting part about bitcoin (among other things).
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:28:46
In hindsight an argument can be made that op could have researched more but at that point in time did enough to conclude that the sites were trustworthy. 
But what do you mean by escrow (when it comes to bitcoin transactions)?

I'm working my way up to the big boy pants but for now I'll be in my pullups. 
Is paper wallet the most secure way to storing bitcoins? Suppose I purchase 10,000 bitcoins tomorrow and use a paper wallet to store them. Is there anyway other bitcoiners find out about my purchase and assemble a crack team to stage a heist?
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:21:12
How did you get the numbers for Scenarios 3 and 4?
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:31:47
Why is there such a discrepancy between the two exchanges? 
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:54:11
N00b here...........are you serious? How do you lose bitcoins? But more importantly if you lose them why can't you get them back? 
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:50:56
Thank you for clearing things up. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:20:22
So the sites like the one where op had coins or like Mt.Gox etc are not wallets. They are just a place to buy bitcoins and once you purchase them it is on you to move them to a wallet? I'm assuming that local wallet with encrypted backups and paper wallets are forms of cold storage?

I'm sorry that you had to go through this. 
For other coinbase user who are new (like me) and don't know if API is enabled on their account (like me). Here is how you check:
1) Go to the top right where it says your email or account name and hover your mouse. 
2) Go to Account Settings
3) Click on Integrations to check the API Key Access
If it's disabled cool. If it isn't:
1) Click on Show My API Key 
2) Disable Key

I agree with the coinbase recommendation. Set up an account there a couple of nights ago. Easy set up. Different levels of verification have different limits for example Level 1 lets you buy 10 BTC and sell 50 per day. Placed an order a few hours ago and coins are expected to arrive by Dec. 5th.

Only time will tell 
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:33:07
Yikes!! Didn't know it got that bad. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:25:18
Price went all the way down to $380?
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:33:49
But what's stopping one of these transparent services to do what these other sites did?  
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:45:37
Thank god I work the 3rd shift ;) I had the front row seat except I might have gone to take a piss when the price dropped to $380. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 10:11:54
So how can bitcoin users protect themselves against such a downside where websites disappear along with their users bitcoins? Can the op have done something to protect their investment? [**Disclaimer:** *I'm just beginning to explore bitcoins and new around these parts so excuse my ignorance*]
