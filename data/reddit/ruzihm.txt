The IRC bootstrap doesn't have anything to do with the blockchain. 
It is for finding an initial set of peers, which the client uses for getting the blockchain in a peer-to-peer manner.
Edit: If the IRC bootstrap is taken down or attacked in some way, there is already a built-in bootstrap node list that the client defaults to.

This doesn't jive with the decentralized philosophy of Bitcoin.
It's sufficient to go with the longest blockchain found, because that is the one with the greatest computing power in its favor. (And therefore, presumably, the authentic one).  That is how Bitcoin works currently.

Yes, this is a central tenant to the security of the bitcoin network, and why bitcoin miners are paid (probablisitcally speaking) proportional dividends to their work.

Yes, the mining pool only needs to look at the block you provide and then test it based on several criteria.  He will only consider the block as proof of work if 
1. The block logically follows from the block chain,
2. The block has his address as the recipient,
3. The block hashes to a value less than the target equivalent to difficulty 1 (when he hashes it himself), and 
4. The block has not already been found that round. 
If you were trying to generate solo blocks and trying to submit them to the pool in order to mooch while you look for a self-paying block, it would not meet criterion 2.  
The other criteria catch other exploits.  I.e., 1 prevents double-spending (any "legitimate" bitcoin miner will meet criterion 1 when generating any hash). 3 ensures that a limited number of hashes qualify for proofs-of work. 4 prevents users from sending the same block over and over once a block that satisfies the other criteria is found.
Disclaimer: I'm not a pool operator, this is just my understanding as an amateur based on my experience "testing" some pools. 
**Edit:** I realized I didn't actually answer your second question.  The answer is that he doesn't need to concern himself (Although he can calculate an estimate based on previous payouts and your current proof-of-work counter, for your convenience.  MtRed does this, for instance.) what your portion of the work is until he finally needs to divy up the payout (if it's pay-per-share he doesn't ever need to know what the payout is for the current block, so I'm assuming you're talking proportional payouts).  He only needs to add 1 to a counter every time you submit a block showing proof of work.  Once he gets a block that meets all the criteria **and** results in a hash below the *actual target* he will take all of the payout and divvy it up based on your contributions and everyone else's contributions.
Again, this explanation is subject to the disclaimer above.

But the only incentive to join these pools is a philanthropic one.  Nobody would join a group in the spirit of self-interest if all of their hard work is inevitably going to be squandered by someone who games the system.  Again, this only will bring philanthropists and amateurs, who gain no more incentive than there is already to join a folding group.

I am not an economist but I'm gonna respond to the  post...


The difficulty of mining increases (that is to say, the target decreases) as the total processing power of the network increases, as often as every two weeks, such that a block will be generated approximately every ten minutes.  If everyone tries to mine bitcoins all day consistently for two weeks, the network will adjust and the rate of bitcoin generation will be the same in the long run.


Bitcoins are currently divisible into 8 decimal places.  If that is not enough, the protocol can be updated to accomodate for more divisions, and therefore, more people.


The early adopters who have the most bitcoins do not determine its value, the people who want to trade for bitcoins do.  Also, the bitcoins the early adopters get from mining blocks is payment for supporting the network, and protecting it from malicious users.  This isn't "free money" in the sense of money earned without invested effort.


Isn't the occurrance of a bubble a natural event when something new and exchangeable enters the market?  A bubble does not mean a scam or a destined failure.  However, this might be the first time this happens to a currency, which brings us to the next point.






I'm not sure how to respond to this.  That's a good point.


The algorithm and protocol can be changed as needed.  Those who do the mining have a stake in the system and would be enticed to fix the issue.  Remember, once bitcoins stop being given out by blocks, miners will be funded by transaction fees.  Therefore, it is in their best interest to fix the algorithm and protocol as necessary. The system is flexible, but we will have to see how well it fares against any challenges before we can determine if it is sufficiently resilient or not.

@_date: 2011-10-20 13:47:03
I think I gave an alright answer to this question [here](  Basically:
* Proof of work needs to be a uniformly random task so nobody with insider or professional knowledge can have an advantage over anyone else.  Processing power should be the only factor.  This leaves us with only problems solvable by ONLY brute force methods.  The current proof-of-work model meets this requirement.
* The difficulty of finding proof of work needs to be calculatable and modifiable so that the rate of bitcoins generated is kept steady as per the protocol's plan.  For instance, you need a way for a computer to say "well that problem was not hard enough, we need to multiply the difficulty by exactly 1.725, and here's how."  The current proof-of-work model can do this.
Edit: Perhaps I misunderstood your question, and that you're not suggesting that this be a way to replace proof of work.  But then this has nothing to do with the bitcoin protocol.  Miners only mine in order to calculate proofs of work, which allows them to collect the block payouts, while increasing the security of the network.  In other words, the cycles that a miner is not calculating proofs of work are cycles that aren't going to the security of the network.
Cycles that aren't contributing to the network's security are of no interest to the protocol.  If someone wants to pay a few miners to do computations, that's more than feasable, but since it's not actually helping the network (since we're saying it has nothing to do with the proof-of-work), there's no reason to include it formally in the protocol.

If one user was to gain 51% control, [Satoshi's white paper]( suggests the following exploit (which, I suppose, is just one possible exploit):
The 51% user makes a payment to someone else, and it gets confirmed x number of times, and the person who received the payment hands over the purchased good.
Then, the 51% guy uses his vast resources to generate a new block chain not including his transaction until its length surpasses the real block chain, after which the network will consider that one the legitimate chain, on the basis of it being the longest.  
Satoshi's math in section 11:**calculations** shows that if over 50% of the network works in conjunction on trying to create a new branch on its own, it will eventually surpass any other branch.
TL;DR if someone controls over 50% of the network in processing power, double spending is possible.
@_date: 2011-05-18 17:28:31
I like how he presents a paper done on proof-of-work for spam filtering and then ignores that with bitcoin proof-of-work, the minority of users who mine, and thereby secure the network, get paid to do so.  With bitcoins, they are enticed to have faster-running machine than their competitors (and thus, any attackers).  
Also, transaction fees mean that users who make higher use of the network don't have to pay in proc cycles, they just end up paying more for the miners in the long run.

Actually, that sounds like a great idea.  It's a huge topic so I'll post bits at a time.  [Here]( is part one.
@_date: 2011-08-17 21:52:16
Namecoin has a value because each unit represents something useful -- a domain name.  If protein coin could be related to something a holder could actually use, then I could see potential (despite the security/business concerns).
The value inherent in bitcoin *is* its security.  If it didn't have that, nobody would want it.  ProteinCoin, while representing work done for the good of medicine, which can be perceived as a unit of value, does not provide any particular usefulness over another currency.  
I think it would be better off with people donating BTC to the foundation that runs fold.it and giving *that* out to the highest computational providers instead of giving out protein coin.  I know we're not focusing on the idea of protein coin but to provide a currency similar to that just seems like an awkward middle man.

(assuming you have windows) Install this and follow all directions. 

You can also use  for a command line interface if you're particularly computer savvy.

Sign up at  and follow the directions there and you should be able to connect to the pool with the program.


Basically, this setup allows you to 
1) Use your GPUs for mining, which will increase your ouput by at least 50x

2) Mine in a pool, which means that all blocks successfully mined are split up between the users proportionally to how much processing they contribute.  This results in a more steady outcome at the expense of surrendering a portion of any blocks you personally find.
@_date: 2011-06-16 15:09:53
No, and here are some technical reasons why.  
The purpose of trying to find these nonces that solve the block is to specifically encode the transactions into the block in a unique manner (such that the block's hash including nonce is less than the difficulty).  A protein folding problem does not necessarily encode any kind of information about the transactions included in the block.  And futhermore, if it could, it would not be ensured that the appropriate situation would be unsolved already.  It is 100% certain that a block has not been solved previously in the current model.  
Also, since some of these applications are not completely random (there are "strategies" to eliminate obviously incorrect protein folding arrangements, for instance), it would not be a challenge based only on computing power, but instead a challenge based on computing power augmented by effort.  The current security model relies on every computer cycle having the same probablistic chance of finding the block's solution (which is why one really determined scammer would need to overcome 50% of the network power to generate his fraudulent blocks), and this would ruin that model.
Tl;dr:Other applications don't necessarily show proof of work and don't contain or confirm data, and other applications are not truly uniformly random.

Also, "folding pools" analogous to mining pools would be incredibly dangerous for the host, because a user gets paid for his work when someone else finds a solution, but if he finds a solution, he can verify it before he sends it to the pool, and instead of submitting his solution to the pool, submit it to the main server and take the whole reward for himself.  
The reason this doesn't happen for Bitcoin is that part of what gets hashed is the recipient of the 50-btc+transaction fee reward.  In the case of a mining pool, the recipient is an address owned by the mining pool operator, who distributes it to the pool users at his discretion.  This means that when the users of a pool try their hashes, they only get a success when they've found a solution that pays the mining pool.  And since the mining pool will only accept proofs-of work that correspond to a payoff for the pool, malicious users can't use their cycles to generate self-payoff and free ride on the pool until then.
And so, nobody would join any folding pools.  And since solo mining is a risky venture where you can not count on a consistent or predictable payoff, the only resources being put into it would be amateur folders and businesses/professional miners who feel that being charitable is a way to hedge their risk, which is pretty much where volunteer folding is anyway.

A legitimate user will only send a proof of work block every time he generates a [block]( that hashes below a target corresponding to difficulty 1 (the lowest difficulty.  According to the math [here]( if you are generating 500 Mhash/s, you would expect to generate a proof of work block every (2^32 / 500 million) seconds, or about 8.59 seconds, which isn't too much data coming from (guessing) an above-average user.
You're right that he is interested in how many blocks you check, but he can get a good (enough) estimate by only checking the blocks that hash below a certain number. 
It is indeed complex and so I feel like I need to explain something.  Please don't take this as me being condescending, but I think it needs to be explained.  When I say "hash below a certain number" I literally mean that when you take a block and hash it, you take the number that results from all the math you perform on the block, and if the resulting number is less than the [target]( it is a successful block concerning the corresponding [difficulty](  The current understanding of the math behind the SHA-256 hashing that bitcoin uses states that one can't predict how "low" the resulting number (hash) is going to be until you actually take the time to do the math.
With that being said, the pool operator sets a target above the actual target (usually the target corresponding to difficulty=1), and credits proof-of-work only to blocks below that target.  The only way of finding hashes low enough to provide you proof of work (that is, a block that hashes below the target at difficulty 1), and therefore being rewarded by the pool, is by doing the same trial-and-error you would need to do to find one that would succeed against the actual current difficulty.  To the users, this means you have to play by the rules consistently if you want consistent payouts from the pool.

I understand that you want the processing power currently used to mine for bitcoins to also be used for other things, and I think that is really admirable.  It truly would be great if it was used for something more philanthropic.
That being said, there are concerns, primarily of security, that really inhibit the use of the processing power to be used for anything "useful".  Unfortunately, mining bitcoins is a venture not unlike a business for a lot of the really hardcore miners, and I expect that they would be hesitant to join a cause that is too risky for their investment.
@_date: 2011-05-21 02:23:01
Not true because the value of the work done by a user is largely determined by how large of a portion of the total network cpu power they are responsible for.  This is the point in why difficulty changes--if the availability of GPU power increases across the board (better gpus, lower gpu prices, etc.), the expected income rate from mining would be the same for a person who provided 0.5% of the network before as after the GPU improvement. 
@_date: 2011-08-17 17:23:43
People keep bringing up protein folding as an alternative or as sort of a side-project to bitcoin mining just because it's something a graphics card can really help out with.
It's true that both operations use the graphics card to do things with trial-and error, but doing protein folding to show proof-of-work will not work. Protein folding is not a uniformly random calculation like SHA-5 hashing is.  There are strategies to eliminate obviously wrong folds and significantly reduce the domain of attempts.  So, then it becomes a combination of developing folding strategies and also hashing, instead of only being hashing which is what provides the double-spending protection critical to bitcoin's use as a currency.
The only things that are acceptable of proof-of-work are **random** AND **uniform** functions. Most "useful" functions to solve, such as optimal protein folding, password cracking, etc., are not **both** random **and** uniform, because the domain can be weighted or even strategically reduced to improve efficiency without investment in stronger technology. On the other hand, hashing a unique set of data (a bitcoin block with nonce) is, and that is why using "useless" hashing to show proof-of-work works particularly well.
**TL;DR:** Most "useful" applications of processing power would not provide the security standard of bitcoin.
Edit:  Also, the difficulty of block hashing can be pretty easily changed and mathematically verified to be a certain degree harder or easier.  The difficulty of protein folding or password cracking is not so easily and precisely modified.
