You're missing the point.  ASIC's are a disruptive technology.   If ANY of this stuff truly exists, GPU's just became *truly* irrelevant.  
@_date: 2013-03-04 04:26:32
So, 28 days later, your hardware is still vaporware, yes?

Disruptive technologies don't *erase* previous ones.  They make them *irrelevant*.    Remember pagers?   Pay phones?   They still exist, right?   But why would you.   
And disruptive as has been demonstrated in the past two weeks, with one group bringing online 3% of the total power of the network, just getting barely ramped up.   Their engineering costs are spent.   You think they're gonna stop for a second right there?   At this point you have to pray that they are ethical enough to match their deployment to the commercial ventures distributing similar tech.    
Your graphics card is good for playing games.  There's another thing orders of magnitude more efficient for generating sha256 hashes now.   
Disruptive because, until recently, it was possible to eek a living with a wall of graphics cards doing this thing.   But now it's not.   That activity is disrupted.

That doesn't mean you should give BFL the benefit of the doubt.   Their specs are defacto made up.   The equipment doesn't exist.   
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:57:40
because the hardware is vaporware.  you can spend $1300 all day long, but at the end of the day, the equipment hasn't shipped.

well then, asking for a refund when bitcoins are at an all time high is something of a losers game, by your math.  
could be argued either way.  i haven't seen the terms of his original contract, and without that, i can't see how *any* argument could be "laughed out" of court.

Personally, I'd like to start working on the next step.   Who wants to buy into my QuantumMiner device?
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:53:54
There's a SQUARE on the map right now.
edit, nevermind, i'm an idiot.  
@_date: 2013-03-02 04:59:48
no no, we're *ethical* quantum miners.   :P   we want to make sure we get enough of these devices in your hands fast enough to keep this thing going.  
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:33:44
No.  They haven't shipped any ASIC hardware.  There is some question as to the hardware existing or shipping ever/while it's still profitable to run it.  
@_date: 2013-03-01 22:50:08
we're mere months away from that happening.  
@_date: 2013-03-01 23:23:20
nonsense.   if i buy something in dollars, and three days later, the dollar is down vs. the yen, do i get less money?
@_date: 2013-04-11 05:45:50
er, if two people deposit the same amount, there is no need to differentiate....they both deposited it.  
@_date: 2013-03-01 23:07:30
a month from now, GPU mining won't be profitable, depending upon your electricity rates.   It's pretty close to no-go on either coast of the US and most of europe already.   
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:15:34
ASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit - these are custom designed chips.   So these particular ASICs, no.        There is another company (avalon) which has shipped some units.   But not many and the buy-in was north of seven grand last i checked.   
@_date: 2013-03-03 20:46:25
I can put a sticker on a box and call it a miner too.   
If i had this hardware in my shop, it would be plugged in, hashing, right now.   
Why on earth would i sell you a money printing machine when i could just plug it in for a week and get the same return?  
Until you see it with your own eyes, it's vaporware.

about 200 MH/s per radeon 6790.
have to ask, what kind of horrifying card gets 20MH?  My hardware was obsolete when i bought it more than two years ago.
