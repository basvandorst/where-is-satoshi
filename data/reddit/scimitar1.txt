I know it sounds counter intuitive in this situation, but the evolution of bitcoin has been so rapid you are not wrong. Except on the last part

It's worked out well for me, and almost a million others.

When silkroad got down, 2 markets popped up (smp and bmr, arguably not bmr as it is older than silkroad ! it was just never popular). The number of listings increased due to publicity and drug dealers moving online. All users migrated. In a matter of a week, there were already tens of thousands of forum posts and thousands of reviews. Then I've made my first purchase on SMP. Now we have 3 strong markets.
There is only one way this shakes out in the next couple of years - more people will be free to acquire their drugs, in a safe and quality-controlled manner, at a risk as minimal as the risk of being struck by lightning.

**THERE HAVE BEEN AROUND 5 BUYERS ARRESTED FOR PERSONAL USE AND ABOUT 30 VENDORS - out of hundreds of thousands.**
People on r/bitcoins and completely oblivious to how safe these sites really are - compared to almost any method of acquiring illicit substances.
Have been using them for the greatest range of quantities and substances for 2 years now. I'll never get back on the street.

You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about.
No addresses or identities are stored on the database. That kinda of crashes your whole conspiratard "reasoning".
I've been using BMR for 3 years - a market much much clunkier and less secure than Silkroad. Seriously, when will these honeypot "theories" end ?
@_date: 2013-11-07 01:07:27
Yes. Out of over a hundred thousand vendors, there's 5 confirmed cases of small - time buyers being busted. (if you can call NoD's bulk shipments to the reseller in Alaska smalltime) and about 30 vendors out of 3000, counting from /2012/ 
It's safer than any street. I'm sorry, but you must be certainly unaware of the encryption and how the network operates.

Any kind of fucking proof ? 
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:35:58
It doesn't have any. It's not open for transactions for another 2 days. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 23:59:34
Are all the people on r/bitcoins completely fucking oblivious to the blackmarkets ?I have used and currently use..well, all of the big three.
Seriously now. Saying that Atlantis devs ran away with the money is just lying. There was a few days grace period to retract funds. There have been like 10 vendors on black flag. 
God damn it the disinformation here is atrocious.

The burden of proof is on you. There's verified vendors. Verified forum admins that had no ties with the original DPR. They didn't copy the source code, just the template.
