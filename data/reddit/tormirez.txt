You can activate bitcoin purchase for old enough accounts (based on the number of games in their account and/or age) and limit it's usage to only one or two times.
edit: or just make it possible for more than a specific value. (tier 2 and 3)

For buying anything online that I can't buy directly by Bitcoin.

Well, I guess the party is over. But I had one question though: Are you a rich guy or a very generous one?
@_date: 2016-11-11 09:02:11
Wow, thank you very much. I envy your generosity.

Thanks. So there is no way that an earlier mined block actually comes after a latter mined block in blockchain? Isn't it the bitcoin network who records the time a block is mined? Can a minor report anytime it wants?

Good explanation. Thanks.

They don't have monthly service fee of $1 but they take $1 fee for top up. (Bit I think advcash.com has a better BTC/USD conversion rate) Also AdvCash issues cards for 3 years but e-coin issues them for 1 year.

Here are some alternatives (some of them might have been mentioned previously):
*  ($1)
*  ($3)
*  ($0.5)
*  ($0.5)
*  ($2.5)
*  ($1)
*  (Free but needs verification)
*  (5€ 
and needs verification)
*  ($9.95 for 1 year card and 49.95	for 3 Years card)
*  (Free because they are in alpha)

You're welcome. I have used SpectroCoin, E-Coin (Wirex) and AdvCash and all of them have 2FA. Cryptopay also have 2FA. I don't know about others but you can find out by looking into their help and support pages.

You're welcome.

Your site looks nice. I am tempted to try it out.
I have a question about monthly fees. What will happen if there is not enough funds in the card by the end of the month? (less that $1 or even $0 in the card)
@_date: 2016-09-24 20:10:56
Thanks for answering. It definitely is a good idea to add it. I have seen no website to explain this.

What is this?! Can't be a hash because it's not hexadecimal. Seems like base64 but is not decodable.

AdvCash doesn't have a monthly fee, but they have a $1 top up fee.
