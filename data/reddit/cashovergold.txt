I know criminals who are in jail for a bag of weed. I know moms in jail for taking a risk on getting their child some marijuana to help their disease. Just because someone goes to jail or prison doesn’t make them a bad person. He should be able to sell whatever he wants to sell. Unfortunately the laws set fourth are meant to control our every move. You should respect the man who dares to challenge the forces authority. Roger Ver is a hero and very respected man.

Wrong! Dummy!
Bitcoin Core = BTC
Bitcoin = BCH
Guys, always use the real Bitcoin(BCH)

Are you insane. Roger Ver is a hero! He made it his duty to save bitcoin. Bitcoin Core and their supporters wants Bitcoin to be something it isn’t meant to be. We need an electronic cash system. We don’t want to use fiat money that can be taken away by governments. He has the balls to  and will to challenge the governments. Roger is actively supporting everyone in the BCH community and I am a witness to that. So whatever bad guy you guys want to paint him as, we don’t see it.

And not to mention, you are apart of a community that was originally meant to meant to challenge the rules and regulation set fourth. I don’t know how did it come to the point of the Bitcoin Core community forgetting that. It seems as if Bitcoin Core intentionally brainwashed some of you guys. Bitcoin will always challenge authority and never be seen as regulation abiding. If you’re in bitcoin, there’s a chance that you to can become a criminal in the future depending on what new laws and regulation they set fourth.

Bitcoin Core = BTC
Bitcoin = BCH
And if you’re not sure, read Bitcoin’s white paper and you determine what currency is closer to Satoshi’s roadmap

BCH already scaled. BTC is still stuck on small blocks.

No one is going to buy. You’re in the wrong community. They don’t support business in this sub. Trust me. If you were accepting BCH only, you’d get so much support. That’s because we actually want to spend our electronic cash unlike core, They’ll just criticize your store, criticize your product and never spend. That’s because if you spend bitcoin, you’re looked at as a joke.

No one spends bitcoin. No one has the intentions on spending bitcoin. No small businesses are supported by bitcoin users. Bitcoin users have the idea in their minds that bitcoin is just a digital gold science project. We spend BCH. We buy support our community. We support all merchants.

I understand why you BItcoin Core supporters have something against real electronic cash, but what’s wrong with EOS? Nothing! Dan Larimer already had success with steemit and bitshares. Don’t you think he’ll have success with EOS as well! Think!
