I paid $946 for two BTC transactions that's why. That's wonderful that the mempool size is going down today but that hasn't been the case in the recent past.
@_date: 2018-01-19 10:14:01
stop telling lies on the internet you shill
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:20:11
you guys are fucking hilarous shooting yourselves in the foot like this at every perceived slight like a paranoid schizophrenic. PIA is great.
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:00:39
Sell your BTC and buy alts. I did!
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:52:40
Agreed. It will show you just how far we've strayed from satoshi's light and why btc's market dominance is declining every day.
@_date: 2018-01-02 05:44:15
yes you're missing that it only took 3+ weeks
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:05:40
yeah I always forget the name of whatever shitty company is running bitcoin. Cause I'm a real person and not getting paid for my opinions.
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:11:20
only you bud
@_date: 2018-01-02 05:47:40
Yeah it won't be watching for much longer. Bitcoin's market domination dropped another %10 today. Another day or two of that and bye bye bitcoin! As much as it pains me to see a good crypto driven into the ground by a stupid company it needs to die so that better coins can take its place.
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:51:20
that's why its market share is dropping every day?
@_date: 2018-01-02 05:49:06
lightning is already here as the shills on the front page are so happy to tell you. It won't change anything. It still requires on chain transactions.
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:45:10


that's right it should cost you at least $30 in fees every time you want to buy a coffee!


done! I love instant free payments.


It definitely doesn't. The only thing it has going for it is that it was the first crypto. That's why the value is so high. Eventually it will be replaced by a superior crypto. Eth is hot on its tail.
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:45:14
Just keep in mind that bitcoin has moved away from becoming a currency and is now considered a "store of value." Average transaction fees are $30. You should look into accepting coins with lower fees such as bitcoin cash (fork of bitcoin) or litecoin. Bitpay will be accepting bitcoin cash very soon.
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:25:10


they're just following the example of bitcoin core
@_date: 2018-01-02 06:01:23
I did it recently and gained a ton
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:41:13
how's your bitcoin doing today bud? I bet you wish you had eth instead.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:54:56


Not if they're put through a tumbler.
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:06:16


if that happens its your fault
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:31:10
same but yes h8
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:54:21
tor is owned by a nonprofit organization not by bcash get your fake news out of here
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:14:08
I just had to pay $946 for two transactions to make sure they confirm fast. Unfortunately most of my btc came from mining which made it a large transaction since there wasn't just like a whole coin in one address.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:33:31
Fees. I spent $946 today in btc miner fees to convert my btc to bch and eth today because the fees are going to kill bitcoin. I'm a long time holder and I just couldn't ignore the insane fees anymore before they got bigger. I've already made those fees back and then some on bch.
The writing is on the wall. You just have to open your eyes and see it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:04:47
Go look at the fees. This has never happened. The writing's on the wall. I'm trying to move my bitcoin to alts but I have to do a bunch of math to figure out how to not lose money on my change addresses. I might have to abandon some of those addresses because of the fees.
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:31:49
fake news
bitcoin is controlled by bitstream
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:15:18
RIP your 0.0000001 btc
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:38:19
nope there's plenty others... looks like I would have paid over $2k transaction fees had I done it today
well that's dishonest after bitcoin's meteoric drop looks like it would be roughly the same fee in USD today ;)
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:38:26
how's bitcoin doing for you today champ?
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:12:59
bitcoin cash was released ;)
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:16:35
they reduced cause its the weekend. They'll be at record highs again monday.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:13:35
block size increase retard... are you that stupid? This problem was predicted and solved many years ago. Get with the times.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:34:04


So you lied to them. Bitcoin fees are not cheap, and lightning won't fix it in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:56:12
because it cost me $946 in fees to move my money immediately before the incoming crash. BCH can handle that. I'll get hit hard? I've already doubled my money.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:33:25
if it wasn't OP is a retard. How can you be smart enough to mine but not smart enough to have your own wallet? Most pools have auto withdraw. Oh and he ignored the warning email.
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:34:15
consider yourself notified we goin to the ground boys
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:56:09
one day you will learn how to read the date and time of a reddit comment. How's your crypto doing today bud? Worse than mine I'm sure.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:25:46
bitcoin core did this... go look at the transaction fees bud. This was entirely predictable and preventable.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:25:08
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:21:32
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:03:04
listen retard ln still needs transactions on the blockchain. There is pretty much no use case where it will help. Try to keep up.
Bitcoin's value agrees with me.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:21:05
actually you can eat rice once if you're lucky with fees
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:05:41
oh look redditgiveawaytemp is trying to educate me on dishonest shills
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:51:13
No it hasn't always been that much. Yes you're missing something. I paid $946 for 2 bitcoin transactions today. Luckily that will never happen again because those two transactions were converting to bch and eth.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:49:22
Long time btc hodler here. I sold my btc for bch and eth today. It only cost me $946 in mining fees for two transactions. Go fuck yourself and enjoy your $10 bitcoins next year.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:48:46
yes, and bitcoin's solution doesn't make any sense since it still requires on chain transactions but we'll see
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:06:24
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:47:08
Convincing anyone of what? I stated facts. I mean you can choose to believe the sky is green if you want but facts are facts. The average fee for bitcoin per transaction is currently over $30.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:49:58
no people using the core wallet or electrum's or many other wallet's suggested fees. Also people that don't want to wait days for their transaction to confirm.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:39:21
just someone smart enough to buy 100 btc in 2013 seeing the writing on the wall just like I did today. I moved mine too. Bitcoin has failed as a currency unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:44:36
can it shill
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:18:45
nope I have old addresses I've never touched in years. It's literally going to cost me $1000 to move my bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:26:31
or zoom in on the tx fee chart. That's what made me gtfo of btc this morning. It only cost me $946 for two transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:50:48
Shit I just saw the law you guys are talking about. Wouldn't exchanges outside of the US not have to comply?
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:06:19
I doubled my money 24 hours later
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:01:01


yes anyone wanting a transaction confirmed with bitcoin is going to overpay immensely
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:40:31
I assume you meant to post this to the bitcoin cash subreddit? That should be going the other way.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:10:09
No it's not how things were supposed to be, but it's how things are due to stupid people running the show. It's not sustainable. Get out while you still can.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:19:47
there is pretty much no use case where ln will help. It still requires on chain transactions. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:24:59
it went from 2300 when I bought to 4000 when I made that reply
don't worry I moved a significant amount to ripple and still made money today LOL
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:24:14
welcome to the bitcoin subreddit. Everyone is a shill unless they're drinking the kool aid
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:23:11
It would seem people are finally waking up on this issue.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:38:06
lol the lightning network literally could not be more useless. that's why I sold. I realized bitcoin literally has nothing to fix this nightmare that's unfolding and has been a clear problem for a long time. The "lightning network" still requires on chain transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:51:18
well good luck... it will be at 0 by then
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:12:04
yes well today it looks like we're seeing what the correct decision was. I just paid $946 in miner fees to gtfo of btc before it cost me thousands in fees to do so.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:28:32
psst.... bcash is going up because bitcoin has failed as a currency in the last week. get out while you still can.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:16:58
and $946 in transaction fees for two transactions later I'm out of bitcoin. Good luck! I'm grabbing some popcorn for the show.
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:04:57
bcash would still have low fees even with bitcoin's current volume.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:30:05
want to buy a bitcoin miner? You can only pay in bcash because btc has failed as a payment system LOL. I want my payment to go through now not next year.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:43:31
I got bad news for you: the lightning network isn't going to fix this for this type of transaction. It still needs transactions on the block chain.
Get out of bitcoin while you still can.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:50:56
are you kidding? nobody is tipping with $30 fees per tip
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:12:37
that doesn't exist yet and as far as I can tell won't make much of a difference.
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:38:58
they only go up from here!
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:56:45
Nope. Plenty of room on that blackchain for new transactions!
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:53:26
keep telling yourself that
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:58:52




Don't you will pay more in fees than what you send them.


If you're not trolling yes bitcoin cash fixed it. It's a fork of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:49:33
it's the truth son
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:49:10
so your answer is that's fine as long as you're very rich?
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:23:31
fake news
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:22:38
this is quite normal for bitcoin. Fees are cents for bitcoin cash btw.
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:43:22
someone is going to decompile the shit out of that game and solve it
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:49:31
I'll probably get banned for saying this (that in itself says a lot about this sub,) but don't forget this sub is ran by people that are just as biased as him. The only reason his forks have any chance of success at all is because bitcoin is actively being held back by the kind of people that run this subreddit, and he's proposing real solutions to the problems bitcoin faces that could have easily been solved long ago.
@_date: 2018-04-12 08:39:20
what if it's the last day it's above 6k? We'll always remember.
