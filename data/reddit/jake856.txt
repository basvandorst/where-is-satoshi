I bought BTCs in Israel as early as 2011.
Meni Rosenfeld &amp; Ron Gross are a very active members of the community since the early stages; they're now involved with MasterCoin.

I'm not so sure about the massive distribution point.
At the end of the day, currently rich people will be herding BTCs, and the overall distribution scheme will mostly remain.
Though, some tech savvies who managed to ride the early waves will present new faces in the top 1% clique.
Technology alters society gradually; it takes time for humanity to comprehend the new ways of thinking.
I predict that "the 99%" will ban Bitcoin in the future, claiming it belongs to the "Satoshi riches". They'll adopt a new crypto, flattening further the distribution graph.

I think the excitement about units is unnecessary.
The one thing people need to understand is that Bitcoin is deflationary coin, with a limited supply of 21M.
Then they should understand that fiat currencies are inflated and eventually hyper-inflated.
As soon as they realize that, the unit doesn't matter. 
They'll understand how to compare a BTC to a USD, and more importantly, realize its full potential.

It's still valuable though to compare the value of BTC in the future, to its nominal value in USD *today*, just to help appreciating the numbers.
The global GDP today is ~$80T.
If BTC dominates 1% of it, it'll be worth the equivalent of $800B, in today's USD.
That makes a single BTC worth $400K, in today's terms, assuming 20M BTCs have been mined.
Of course, by that time, today's $400K would have been inflated many times away, but their respective value compared to the total economy would be about the same.
Edit: as _red noted bellow, it's $40K, not $400K.

I don't agree with his analysis, but gold does have something that Bitcoin doesn't.
Bitcoin is susceptible to socialistic trends and whims. Future users might decide to alter the algorithms, or make unintentional mistakes that break the currency.
Gold is backed by physics. 
As long as we don't have a physical method of synthesizing it, it'll have a steady value, when compared to other goods and services. 
This makes it a good "value storage" and a point of reference.

Shamir &amp; Ron are a well respect professionals in their field (cryptography). Especially Shamir, which has won multiple prestigious awards.
They might have missed the details of Bitcoin, but you'll have to offer something better than a spelling error.
