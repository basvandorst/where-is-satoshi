Don't think so. I believe you would have to go through an Crypto exchange website to do that.

Here is the relevant text-
All payments are fully automatic - as a seller all you have to do is to reach a certain threshold and you'll be then paid automatically.
Sellers are paid on PPS (Pay Per Share) system under the next schedule:
- Once per day for NiceHash-wallet unpaid balances, greater than 0.001 BTC.
- Once per day for external-wallet unpaid balances, greater than 0.1 BTC.
- Once per week for external-wallet unpaid balances, greater than 0.01 BTC.
Payments for external-wallet balances less than 0.01 BTC are (temporary) suspended due to unsustainable transaction fees. 
Unpaid balances, lower than 0.0001 BTC are considered as leftover amounts and the only option for you to get these amounts paid out is to connect your miner long enough to reach unpaid balance higher than 0.001 BTC which will then be processed in full in the next payout process. Please also note that we are periodically discarding amounts, lower than 0.0001 BTC for all long term inactive miners. All balances from all algorithms are aggregated into a single payment."

Nice hash miner has incremental payouts, It will payout sooner if you have more money in your nice hash account, and will then transfer it to your other wallet.

What I meant by that was go from btc to fiat (usd, euro, etc) and then deposit the fiat into your PayPal account. And I don't know enough about the different crypto exchanges to recommend one, sorry
