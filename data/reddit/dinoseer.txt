Looks like a Painting.  A Mural is applied directly to a Wall...

The Financial System is Corrupted and therefore, has to be Eliminated for the Human Race to move forward.  Plain &amp; Simple.  All Corrupted Systems have to be done away with, since passing more Laws &amp; Regulations isn't going to fix anything.  Move Past the Corruption \- Kill the Banks, Insurance Companies, and everything else that is holding US back from moving Forward.  Y'all keep playing games with letting the Banks get control of Crypto\-Currency and that will have to go too.  Move to a Resource\-based Economy to Make the Rich just like everyone else \- just another Human Being, just being...

Well then... Looks like you are not ready to join us in moving the Human Race forward.  One day you will, when the corruption affects your life. Insurance companies prey on their "customers" to turn a profit upon the misery of people. IT all has to go. Governments, Borders, $$$, and even Religions.  Otherwise we are Doomed as a Species...

The Venus Project is just one example of what we can accomplish if we can get past the corrupted systems in place now. Those in power are not going to give up peacefully - history has shown that. There will be more bloodshed before this chapter of Human failure is complete. we have to stop dropping Bombs to secure resources and remove Greed as an incentive or as a desirable goal to be considered successful in Society. Every Human has to be valuable as a resource, other than raising them to be Tax Slaves.

I am unphased by downvoting (don't even really know what all that is about - my ideas are not a popularity contest), attempted Trolling or what not.  I was just pointing out something I thought was Ironic.  My wittle feelings can't be hurt by the likes of the small-minded.  I challenge ideas, and do not attack individuals or resort to name-calling, etc.  Those that do, can just go back to their Safe Space, curl up into the Fetal Position, and try again from their Silicon Obsession...

Ummm.  Bitcoin is already being broadcast around Mother Earth, via the Internet...

Bitcoin, the Blockchain and Decentralized Banking are Incredible Concepts, and I wish they could serve their Altruistic Goals, but as things are now, IT is all being co-opted by the Powers That Be - Regulated, turned into a Commodity and Bastardized into serving the very Institutions we wish to overthrow, marginalize and make irrelevant.

But the Satellite has to send information to an Internet Node to be broadcast across Mother Earth.  Not dissing the children.  Pointing out that the information will still be on the Internet, which is already on the Internet...
