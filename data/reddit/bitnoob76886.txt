I'll repost it in 2 years if Bitcoin hasn't burst.

It's the idea that the price of any asset on the stock market incorporates all available and pertinent information.  Basically that markets work and prices reflect reality.

That's the problem. Good coders who don't understand shit about economics are creating a massive bubble, and rubes are throwing their money away.

How does that different from a fiat currency?

It didn't seem to list any businesses or governments using it?
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:45:26
So its a fiat currency?
@_date: 2017-12-25 21:48:30
I must have missed it, because the only threads I saw didn't list anything?

It's been 10 years. If it's revolutionary, shouldn't someone be using it?
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:25:30
So it's a fiat currency without any authority backing it. That's better for reasons?

It's purely speculative/religious. If common usage was going to take off, it would have done so a decade ago. At this point Bitcoin is really just evidence the efficient markets hypothesis is wrong.

Rightfully so, given it's a bubble and the true value is $0. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:37:40
Your response suggests you don't know what a fiat currency is. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:53:41
It's a bubble. It has no intrinsic value, and nothing backing it. Fools will spend a lot of money and take out loans, and when it crashes they'll cry conspiracy.

Lol unless people figure out it's a worthless asset bubble and you lose everything. Bitcoin is purely speculative and worthless as a currency. When was the last time cash took 2 weeks for a transaction and charged a fee?
