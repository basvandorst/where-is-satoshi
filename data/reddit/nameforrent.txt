True story, I lost a coins to the dice back in december. It was quite a thrill. First, I've bought $1000 worth for 75 BTC. I've managed To make up to 287 BTC as my peak, before losing it all. I've tried again with 75 BTC, and I've made it back to 200 BTC much to my amazement, then I lost it again. I've tried one last time for 75 BTC. I did not even make it past 120 BTC. After that, I've since bet about 40 BTC which lost.. Please learn from me. Do not play dice.

Thanks. I am okay now, I have since learned my lesson. I tried again with 150 BTC, started trading shares, ect. I also have an Avalon II pending so I'm not that down. I know it's easy to say "you're an idiot, ect." But.. it the feeling was extremely insidious. I normally don't gamble at all.. But when I first bought BTC, I did NOT feel as thought BTC was money. If it were $1000, I wouldn't bet it like that.

I bought $20 worth. I got 0.09049316.. which is most definitely not bitstamp+3%. more like bitstamp+10%.

People sometimes recognize it and they say.. "oh, thats Bitcoin isn't it?" Then the server listens in and starts a discussion about BTC.

Asking to downvote my thread? That was also a blatant lie you did. You never asked me to delete or fix it. Liar.

The sad part is 160 bitcoins will turn out to be millions of dollars in a few years.
