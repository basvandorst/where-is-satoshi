No. The fact that there is no central entity is it’s fundamental value prop. I would take your friends opinion with a grain of salt.  This person clearly feels ok with pretending to sound informed about things they know nothing about.

It sux that these guys are ok with having a negative impact on crypto as a whole to make a few bucks. Bitcoin should shake this off pretty easily but it’s really annoying that they are diluting the brand this way and buying the media off  to support a false narrative. 
I finally got tired of waiting to sell my free BCH on coinbase so I sent it to Bittrex and dumped it there.

This whole stress test is a pump scam to raise the price so ppl can unload ahead of this 3-way fork shitshow. I hope Jihan dumps on the poor souls that bought more to “test the scalability of the network”. I went over there to watch the drama and apparently all sorts of services are breaking etc. But of course most of what you hear is false equivalency to BTC claiming how this proves yards yadda yadda..

How is a shitty banker conference considered responsible for this price movement? Most people in crypto don’t even know it happened, and most people I talked to that went had a blast.
@_date: 2018-08-18 17:26:28
I don’t know if I’ll summarize it correctly, but support for Segwit2x and other proposals split the community along certain lines in 2017. Factions developed around r/bitcoin and r/btc. When Bcash came along Ver and his cronies controlled r/BTC and it morphed into an echo chamber for Ver/Jihans agendas of pumping their altcoin which allows ASIC boost cheating to continue among other things that essentially work out in their favor. Now they use it as part of their “Bcash is the real Bitcoin” scam narrative and to take shots at the core team and Bitcoin. They should move it obviously but it helps them scam people because it takes new entrants a little time to work out what is real and what isn’t.

What the actual fuck today.
@_date: 2019-03-21 16:50:36
good point. the 3 min candle on binance during the dump was like 2k BTC, which is a lot and it didn't do as much damage as you might expect. It will probably recover today and that kinda makes for sad bears.

@_date: 2019-03-03 18:14:28
This is awesome tho because if we get "Sats" in the hearts and minds of new users and normies it gives Bitcoin a lot of perceived headroom and will help with unit bias A LOT.

@_date: 2019-03-20 02:35:50
I had a serious question.. not trolling. Yesterday I \*think\* you said futures were closing today and that it would cause a flash dump and possibly a spike soon thereafter. I saw something saying CME futures close on the 28th.. that was my question, am I looking at the wrong info? 
@_date: 2019-03-21 18:52:22
BTrash is irrelevant at this point. Which one is even winning?
@_date: 2019-03-30 03:34:35
This may sound pedantic, but somewhere earlier today I read a post about "what if there was a run on tether?". I'm not sure how that would work in terms of tether actually having to cough up USD, but if there was a run on exchanges by people withdrawing as u mentioned, I assume half of them would be proven insolvent and it would clean some bullshit out of this market. I think there is a lot of paper crypto/database entries out there that are probably acting as inflation.
@_date: 2019-03-30 03:37:12
Why is it weird that someone wants to spread their bitcoin between different addresses? I mean, it could be something interesting but it doesn't sound particularly conspiratorial.

Spent the rest on beer so who's to blame? (Bitcoin!)
They say I'm fucked up all the time (Bitcoin!)
"Well, the dude's a waste of time" (Bitcoin!)
I know it'll be okay
I get a Bitcoin in me, all right
My girlfriend asked me which one do I like better? (Bitcoin!)
I hope the answer don't upset her (Bitcoin!)

That would be the "prints more money" part. The terms usually refers to expanding the monetary supply using the methods you mentioned, not literally running the printing presses, which probably happens as well :)

There will be thousands but very few of them will be relevant. Part of what makes one “the best” is the degree of security as defined by the amount of resources that have been expended to resist attacks using PoW. As u know people have different opinions and priorities so you will commonly hear that something is a “bitcoin killer” because it has fast block time or can launch an ICO. IMO these people don’t get it but to each their own.

I’m fairly sure there have been no changes to the opcodes/script lang that move bitcoin towards being Turing complete. As someone noted above, the instruction set was purposefully reduced I believe to reduce the attack surface.

IMO most of them will disappear and be replaced by other short lived shitcoins. The good ones will survive. I don’t tell people to short and buy back cuz it’s a hard game. If I was good at it, I would try, but the time for that was a couple of weeks ago and I didn’t see it.

Nothing. It’s gets discarded and the rest of the chain is invalid and will be reorganized on the offending node starting on the invalid block. Unless they get 51% of the network to agree to change the validation rules with them this won’t happen.

@_date: 2018-02-02 00:47:16
Since you asked, and not that my opinion matters.. but, IMO they are different things created for different purposes. I like BTC to store value (lol right now) and alts when I require the specific service or value prop they provide. 
Iota is super interesting, as is eth. Not knocking them.

Nailed it.
@_date: 2018-02-15 03:10:42
So the calculations secure the network and give us the ability to manage value store and transfer independent of centralized organizations. This is the main innovation that bitcoin brought and continues to bring to the table. The “use” for the calculation is interesting in that as many of them are discarded, we are computing results that are irreversible due to the sheer magnitude of power that is being dedicated to creating solutions within a certain difficulty range. Because these algorithms have *physical limitations* based on available computing power and electricity it creates a security model that is effectively impenetrable by, practically speaking anyone that cannot surpass this resource commitment which grows exponentially over time.. It’s a bit heavy handed but large scale Proof of Work is the only proven consensus model that we have and can be considered “physically secure” against large/state level entities that may wish to overthrow public consensus.
Last edit: I think freeing money from central control and manipulation is worth the electricity. That’s what Bitcoin does, and a few of the other large coins to a lesser extent.

Bitcoin Cash is an attempt to profit from brand confusion. BTC , the network predominantly defined by the client developed by Bitcoin Core is Bitcoin in spirit and on exchanges, It’s good that you asked because (Bcash, Btrash, Bcrash, Bitcoin Cash) offers no apparent innovation, relevance, mining power or dev team and it’s likely going to die off soon.

It’s actually not like storing under your mattress, it’s more like converting it to gold and storing the gold. It puts the unwanted fiat back into circulation and does not reduce available supply like storing the fiat would. So it’s even better.
@_date: 2018-04-11 12:01:36
Actually I vaguely remember him from back then now that u mention it. I think I had a bloomberg logo burnt into my tv. He is def an interesting guy, maybe I'm playing into the RT thing a bit much or not giving him credit for being able to speak outside the official narrative.

@_date: 2018-04-11 12:11:33
Hold my beer.. My point is that this is an ~~contentious~~ inflammatory topic, watch what happens hehe.
BTC fees are extremely low right now and Lightning Network is taking hold so the performance and fee arguments don't really hold up. While this is a highly politicized topic, there are a few things that seem undeniable. Any meaningful innovation, mindshare and development comes from BTC/Bitcoin/Bitcoin Core. Bcash is basically any other altcoin with no real team or innovation to speak of. They forked Bitcoin and tweaked a few things, mostly for marketing effect and purposfully seed division in the greater community. The arguments made by BCash about block size, segwit, LN etc. are usually short lived, trivial and serve only to wrest control of the "brand" Bitcoin from Bitcoin Core and the incumbent team. This is presumably to line the pockets of people like Roger Ver, Jihan, CSW etc. Aside from Jihan's contribution to (large scale/centralized/ASIC) mining they have all essentially proven themselves to be Charlatans of one type or another. From Ver (alledgedly) paying a shill/troll army and attempting to manipulate the market in various ways, as well as misleading people by selling BCash as the "real bitcoin" to CSW literally claiming to be Satoshi(not shitting you) it's a pretty grim scene. You can see the factions at work in the r/bitcoin(pro core) and r/btc(pro cash) subreddits. This is just my personal view but I think it's clear that the Bcash crew purposefully creates confusion so new people mistake it for Bitcoin. They vehemently FUD Bitcoin Core, to whom they owe the entirety of their product at the time of the fork. It's just gross IMO. I assume you will get the other side of the story rather quickly, but if you are interested check the r/btc sub and decide for yourself. It took me a while to come to my own conclusions but I suppose I am what you would call a "core supporter".

Well clearly it’s because I was trolling r/BTC yesterday and let him know that bcash is dead. Apparently he listened to my advice and changed his perspective. I’m guessing he just hadn’t heard  about that yet and upon my announcement  he realized he was beating a dead hooker and decided to support BTC going forward. All it takes is a little outreach ya know?
