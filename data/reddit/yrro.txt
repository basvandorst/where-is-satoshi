It's better to give each customer a separate address. Bitcoin transactions are public, so I can watch  and then send an email claiming to have sent from any of the addresses listed.
You can avoid doing the coding work yourself if you use one of the services listed at &lt;
As an interim measure, you can request that people emailing you sign a message with the address that they sent from in order to prove that they really control the address. This is a new feature in version 0.7 of the official bitcoin client, however, so most of your customers won't have upgraded yet (and other clients will probably lack the functionality for a while, so you can't rely on everyone being able to do it).
[edit] ah, you say you're generating an address per customer already? That's fine. But the page you linked to doesn't mention this. :)

bitcoin-24 are based in Poland and are the highest-volume EUR exchange [24-hour volume 50k BTC, MtGox a mere 27k]( I get the impression that bitcoin-24 is a bit of a one man band; however I've successfully bought a small amount of BTC there over the last couple of weeks (from GBP via TransferWise, which amazingly only took ~36 hours) and transferred it to cold storage. I have not sold BTC there, so I don't know how long a withdrawl will take. I also contacted their support, to enquire whether withdrawing via TransferWise would be a problem, and they very quickly replied, saying that they foresaw no problems with doing so. Their web site remained up and stable throughout last night's... unpleasantness too, so either they weren't a target of the DDOS attacks, or they weathered them, or the DDOS attacks weren't as widespread as some have speculated.

That's a [bug]( in the current HEAD of poclbm. If you checked it out of git, `git reset --hard HEAD^`, or apply [this patch]( manually, or just download an older release. Oh, and `muh` isn't a valid port. I think the official client listens on port `8332` same as the pools, so try that when you get a ValueError when the URL is parsed. :)
BTW, mining for yourself will earn only slightly more than being in a pool over the long term, and in the short term your returns from mining will be *much* more swingy. It only takes a moment to sign up for a pool, and you will start receiving fractions of a Bitcoin immediately.
With a single GTX 560 Ti your returns won't be great however, and may not even exceed the cost of your electricity. No reason not to do it for fun if you have the hardware otherwise idle, of course! You can look your hardware up on  to see your expected hashrate and power consumption.

1. Yes (HOWEVER you have to do a new backup every so often, since `wallet.dat` includes 100 pre-generated private keys &amp; their addresses for change
2. You could get by with some other software that reads `wallet.dat`, but unless you are a programmer you should stick to bitcoin-qt.
3. You can do this with the `dumpprivkey` command (help -&gt; debug -&gt; console; issue it once for each public key that has funds and you'll get the four private keys that you need to store on your paper wallet.
4. It's not humanly possible to generate transactions without using a "client" of some sort.
In all honesty, I would only create a paper wallet in this way for long-term ("cold") storage. With this method, as soon as you want to spend some, but not all, of the coins at an address you have to keep track of the change addresses of your transactions, which is tedious at best and error-prone at worst.
A more convenient way to manage a paper wallet would be to use a client such as Electrum, that generates all keys/addresses deterministically from a 'seed'; you only have to store the seed offline; whenever you want to spend coins, you can run Electrum, enter your seed, spend your coins, and once you're done, delete the data files. No more faffing with regular backups, or change addresses, etc.

As long as you haven't imported any addresses manually then all you need is the seed phrase. Write it down and store it somewhere safe.

Addresses are only 160 bits long, so the computer described in that quote could enumerate them many times over during the sun's remaining life span. However we are never going to be able to build such a computer until waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay after the 21 millionth coin has been minted. ;)

You need to give it a URL in the following format. Make sure you include all fields match punctuation exactly.
    
e.g., `
If your pool doesn't give require a password just put in `blah` or any old string... poclbm still requires it in the URL.

RAID is for improving availability... you still need to make regular backups. I'm sure you know this, but your post doesn't make it clear, and I don't want anyone getting the wrong idea!

TBH Microsoft themselves have stated that UAC in its default configuration (without password prompts) is *not* a security barrier.
I still log in as a normal user on my Vista/7 machines, and enter a password when prompted to elevate to my separate administrator account.

What with all the posts on here bitching about MtGox, I'm amazed that so many people seem to have no idea about the alternatives. Granted that for USD, MtGox has ~10x the volume of each of their nearest competitors (BTC-e, Bitcion Central), but still... do some basic research, people! I am surprised that I've seen so little mention of bitcoin-24 on here. But I suppose most users of this board are from the US.

A "skype-style bitcoin exchange" would be a centralized exchange, run by a massive for-profit organization (Microsoft) that would shares all details about transactions with US intelligence/law enforcement by default.

Your paranoia is sensible, but for you to lose your coins, all existing copies of the source code would have to have been destroyed. Barring this unlikely event, anyone can build their own copy of Electrum, or re-implement its [deterministic address generation algorithm](

It could be that they reserve the right to perform deduplication, but don't in practice do it with their current implementation.

The meat:






There you have it, folks. In the future, all cloud service providers must provide pro-active filtering of "illegal"/"harmful" content to be seen as "legitimate". And if you're a user unlucky enough to be hit by a false positive... you're can kiss your files goodbye.
That said... Mega claims to be able to perform de-duplication; so I don't see why the same mechanism can't be used for filtering.

In the long run I expect to see payment service providers protect themselves against exchange-rate fluctuations by purchasing futures. I don't know if that really happens much today.

Take an image of the hard drive **right now**. Operate on the image from this point forward. Run [PhotoRec]( over the image; with a bit of luck, it will find some BDB files, one of which will be your wallet.
You may have to tell PhotoRec how to identify BDB files first:

You should sign that key with your personal key, plus a few signatures from other people in the community, then republish it to the key servers. If none of the people who sign the key are in the strong set, then they should get their keys cross-signed by those who are. If this sounds like greek to you then let me know and I can explain further. Going to bed now!

Bitcoin addresses are 160-byte hashes of a public key. 2^160 is a rather large number. In Applied Cryptography, Bruce Schneier explains how difficult it would be to build a computer that merely *counts* up to a particular number assuming you were able to harness all the energy produced by our Sun for a year:






Now, there are only 2^160 Bitcoin addresses, so this hypothetical computer will be able to enumerate all the possible Bitcoin addresses 2^(187-160) or about 134 million times in a year. I think it's safe to say that humankind is further than this factor away from being able to produce a computer that can operate at these ultimate physical limits of computation. :)
BTW, the coolest part of the quotation is the ending:


but sadly this doesn't *quite* apply here since there are only 2^160 (i.e., about 10^48) possible addresses. :)
