I suggest a better alternative, instead of "bits", "New Bitcoin" as I explained here:

Urgent posts? This has been discussed for many years now... and the price been dropping the whole year..
@_date: 2014-09-22 18:16:54
Calling it "bits" is also redefining the bitcoin unit, even worse is that in this case it's a completely unrelated name that could cause even more confusion...
And when people want to go short, they ommit the currency name altogether like: "it costs 1.99"; they don't have to say "it costs 1.99 dollars"

Why not Bergzoid Coin?
@_date: 2014-09-23 16:43:54
bits is the stupidest name ever. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 04:56:22
Here's my proposal:
@_date: 2014-09-22 13:17:35
I agree that "bits" is just stupid.
But I have a similar proposal to avoid confusion: name the 0.000001 unit a **"New Bitcoin"**
This change is in line with the pattern used by many currency redenominations throughout financial history.
- New French Franc replaced French Franc
- Turkish New Lira replaced the Turkish Lira
- New Taiwan Dollar replaced Taiwan dollar
and many more.
Eventually, the "New" part can be dropped in 10 or 15 years.

That's a really poor analogy.

So because I made a new account you assume that it's an urgent post? I can't get your logic. Maybe you have a problem accepting anonymity? 
@_date: 2014-09-25 20:03:53
No, like these:
- 2005 - New Lira (replaced Turkish Lira)
- 1949 - New Dollar (replaced Taiwan Dollar)
- 1999 - New lev (replaced Bulgarian lev)
- 1960 - New Franc (replaced French Franc)
- 1986 - New Shekel (replaced Israel Shekel)
- 1994 - New Dinar (replaced Yugoslav Dinar)
- 1991 - New Sol (replaced Peruvian Sol)
- 2006 - New Manat (replaced Azerbaijani manat)
- 1967 - New Cruzeiro (replaced Brazilian cruzeiro)
Too bad your culture is limited to apple products.

So an obscure slang used in one of 196 countries in the past should be adopted by the whole world?

Bits is confusing. I propose the name "New Bitcoin". Here's why.
The best approach is to keep the name "Bitcoin" and make it somehow represent another decimal unit.
How to do that?
First, we have to decide what we're aiming for, let's say 0.001 BTC.
Then, we give it a name. Now this is the **important part**, remember we have to keep the name "bitcoin" but make it somehow refer to another decimal unit. So we give the 0.001 the name "New Bitcoin".
So both units will coexist, the original BTC and "New BTC" which is equal to 0.001 BTC, but only "New BTC" will be used for daily transactions. So after a few years, people will eventually drop the "New" in "New Bitcoin" and will refer to it as just "Bitcoin". This means we will eventually go back to using just "Bitcoin". This is how you transform
This is the same strategy used by several currencies redenominations around the globe, so people are generally familiar with this convention.
It's based on the approach used in several currency redenominations throughout history. See:
- 2005 - Turkish New Lira (replaced Turkish Lira)
- 1949 - Taiwan New Dollar (replaced Taiwan Dollar)
- 1999 - Bulgarian New lev (replaced Bulgarian lev)
- 1960 - New French Franc (replaced French Franc)
- 1986 - New Shekel (replaced Israel Shekel)
Germany used similar approach, always keeping the nama "mark" in their redenominations, eg. rentenmark, papiermark, deutschmark, etc.
Chinese Yuan also used something similar, gold yuan replaced old yuan, second yuan replaced first yuan, etc.

When currencies are redenominated, people will know the reason, and in the case of bitcoin, it's because of hyperdeflation.
What I'm aiming for is to indicate the user that they are still getting bitcoins rather than a total different thing like "bits". The idea is to never lose the name "bitcoin".

"New Bitcoin" is better than bits
@_date: 2014-09-22 19:19:20
Did you mean 0.00001 or 0.0000001 or 0.000001?
@_date: 2014-10-01 21:10:55
I propose a better unit name than the disastrous "bits".
0.000001 BTC = 1 "New Bitcoin"
Why "New Bitcoin"?
Because of history:
- 2005 - New Lira (replaced Turkish Lira)
- 1949 - New Dollar (replaced Taiwan Dollar)
- 1999 - New lev (replaced Bulgarian lev)
- 1960 - New Franc (replaced French Franc)
- 1986 - New Shekel (replaced Israel Shekel)
- 1994 - New Dinar (replaced Yugoslav Dinar)
- 1991 - New Sol (replaced Peruvian Sol)
- 2006 - New Manat (replaced Azerbaijani manat)
- 1967 - New Cruzeiro (replaced Brazilian cruzeiro)
See my post here: 
@_date: 2014-09-25 19:16:24
The default should be "New Bitcoin"
So 0.000001 = 1 New Bitcoin
See my post here: 
Funny Bitpay is pushing "bits". It would be a great marketing advantage for them, that's why they are pushing it.
Bits suck.

You're still getting it wrong. There's no cap in bitcoins in the protocol. The only cap that exists in code is the satoshi cap.
Saying that the protocol can be changed is silly in this context.
@_date: 2014-09-24 20:25:21
Wrong... it's capped at 21 millions * 100,000,000 units
Bitcoin is an arbritrary term used to refer to 100,000,000
@_date: 2014-09-24 07:50:34


Wrong. Exchange fee is really not needed. When more people receive bitcoins from their employees and pay their bills with bitcoins, there will be no need for dealing with exchanges.
@_date: 2014-09-22 19:29:19
ah ok so I call 0.00001 10 microbitcoins
@_date: 2014-09-23 19:49:40
Well the intention is to never lose the name "bitcoin". So the new redenomination should include "bitcoin" in the name, to indicate people that they are getting bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-09-22 22:47:43
A friend of mine said the opposite, what now?
@_date: 2014-10-01 21:13:39
Wow you are really dumb man, of course it can be changed in the protocol, it's you who talked about the cap limit in the first place.
@_date: 2014-09-22 18:30:12
It's more than proven that the name "bits" is controversial and a bad choice.
But I have a similar proposal to avoid confusion: name the 0.000001 unit a **"New Bitcoin"**
This change is in line with the pattern used by many currency redenominations throughout financial history.
- New French Franc replaced French Franc
- Turkish New Lira replaced the Turkish Lira
- New Taiwan Dollar replaced Taiwan dollar
and many many more redenominations followed a similar pattern.
Eventually, the "New" part can be dropped in 10 or 15 years.
