Go watch the movie the **BIG SHORT** and a chick in a bathtub explains it is "to bet against"

Soon one bitcoin = one lambo
@_date: 2019-06-27 06:58:05
13.8 to 11.7 bro .... the top was $13,868 at Coinbase
@_date: 2019-06-08 05:15:40
Well, it didn't drop by 50%
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:03:09
Yeah, we're so stupid.  You were saying the same thing when Bitcoin was $4000 saying we would go to zero.  You will say the same when we're at $40,000.   You probably think Gold is worthless also.  Not everyone wants the government to control every aspect of their life and would like a little insurance with Gold or Bitcoin against uncertainty.
@_date: 2019-10-24 04:17:03
So awesome!
@_date: 2019-06-27 07:01:10
Coinmarketcap said 45 billion but obv that is insane
@_date: 2019-06-21 05:26:35
So funny, Wells Fargo just said the max projection for gold is $1400, but probably will move closer to $1200.  That should have been a signal to buy Gold.
@_date: 2019-06-27 07:00:36
Yup, some of us bought and held when we hit 19k and also held when we dropped to $3300.   And still there today :)
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:01:05
Well said.  I mean we had four or five months of $4000 or below.
@_date: 2019-06-26 06:56:56
We say this but I know a bunch of you are selling and not going to hodl.  When Bitcoin is $50,000 or $100,000 or $150,000 and you say kick yourself because you were AHEAD of the curve and knew the decentralized revolution was going to change the word but did nothing about it.

6% of Americans are net worth one million or more, one one in six millennials have $100,000 saved.  
So you're 0.01% is probably meant to be a joke, but obviously way off.  I'd say 25% of people have $100,000 saved.
@_date: 2019-06-30 14:21:48
Dude, give me some credit.  Once Bitcoin is that high that is when we can being to use Bitcoin in the manner you suggest.  I use crypto in my life often and "live crypto" and spend Crypto even when I can use fiat.  So I believe as stridently as possible.
@_date: 2019-06-07 00:04:05
You have your private keys and its open source and you have your backup code.  If [Blockchain.com]( shut down tomorrow I'd have all my coins with no issues.
@_date: 2019-06-27 07:01:51
My buddy sold at $4400.  I told him to hodl.
@_date: 2019-06-27 06:59:56
Alts are getting DESTROYED .... only Bitcoin and a little Ether.  Really shows the truth that Bitcoin is the mega king of all.
@_date: 2019-06-26 07:04:18
Well, do you feel better about it now??
@_date: 2019-06-08 05:15:48
Lot more now
@_date: 2019-06-27 06:58:33
up 22% on the and up 40% on the week, what did people expect??
@_date: 2018-11-17 06:56:23
When cashing out.  MOVE the real Bitcoin FIRST.  Then cash in your alts.  
Not doing this will very possibly result you in lost Bitcoin that is worth 90%+ of your main *"coins"*
@_date: 2019-05-12 00:14:33
Everything is more fun during the pump
@_date: 2019-05-22 02:11:44
Exactly.  There is zero other option in the United States.
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:33:03
I stacked my sats.   I was so scared at $3200 but kept buying.  I was terrified and you all said we'd drop to $800 but I believed!!
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:45:56
None.  Don't lie *(that would be bank fraud)* but I would recommend against volunteering to any bank you're trading Bitcoin or crypto.
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:49:09
2019 is resembling 2015  
2018 resembled 2014  
2017 resembled 2013  
2016 resembled 2012
So we won't hit $20,000 until end of 2020 based on this.  But watch out in 2021 when we get to $100,000
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:51:29
It's a nightmare
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:50:51
The US does not want to ban crypto.  One idiot in congress out of 535 wants to.  This title is so misleading.
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:12:02
I was terrified at $3200 we were dropping to $800.  Obviously loving life today :)
@_date: 2019-05-10 01:28:37
Well said.  Lightning and second layer solutions should be super cheap and amazing when they are ready.
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:46:40
ABRA is fantastic but they promote terrible.  Somehow people have a bad impression of them.
@_date: 2019-05-20 23:02:11
Best mainstream media piece that has ever been made
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:41:33
That is a really high commission.  I feel like Gemini has a lot of people that only buy and sell one time as opposed to Binance which has a lot more active traders back and forth.  You would have hoped the Gemini dollar interest was covering for them.
@_date: 2018-12-19 06:31:38
Who is this?
@_date: 2018-12-19 06:28:52
Damn, that would suck because in today's world wealth inequality isn't a problem.  
@_date: 2019-05-22 02:12:21
It does not work outside of Europe
@_date: 2019-05-26 20:33:39
[Blockchain.com]( so simple to use.  Copay also super easy to use.  No KYC, no AML.  Simple and easy.
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:49:24
$8400 ??    We were at $19,000 less than 18months ago.  We always fly past the old ATH
