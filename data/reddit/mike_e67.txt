Hello Vera,
Thanks for your reply. Support told me I have 'another account' that has been used to commit fraud. Can you please share some details why you think that account is related to me??

Via bank transfer (card to card)

I was a buyer not the seller

Thanks for your support!
I'll be waiting for LBC to get back to my case, as well as informing other users about LBC's policy (as it is right now).

This is what I received from the support:










It was an answer to my question about how can I deal with the problem and what actions are required from me to unlock my BTC that were purchased absolutely legally (LBC can contact the seller if they want!). They also don't give me any information about these 'clear evidences'.
Looks like they can block anyone based on some 'clear evidences' (that they won't disclose!) and just expropriate your funds no matter if it was purchased absolutely legally and the seller has no complains on you! It's just unbelievable.
I'm just asking what can I do in this situation to resolve this problem bearing in mind that I have no access to the account that was linked to me, but:
— I have access to my passport and driver's license (if someone used the scans or something like that to identify themselves as me)
— I'm using private VPN and there are 30-something users only that use the same VPN (if the accounts were linked based on the same IP)
— I'm using nearly-private mail server (and I know everyone who has mail accounts on the same server)

I also have two questions:
1. My account was banned AFTER I made a deal and not BEFORE it. But there are no complains on me related to that deal. Why is it like that?
2. Are there any issues related to the deal on my account that was banned? Seller had no complains, banks had no complains, even LBC did not say anything about that deal. So why my funds that were purchased without any issues are still on hold?
