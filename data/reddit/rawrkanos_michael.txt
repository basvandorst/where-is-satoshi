I disagree. While the theory and the creation are important, this block or several blocks very near it in time appear, based on the historical hashrate assumptions(factored based on time-per-block), to have been mined by Satoshi. The fact that there was ever a time when Satoshi Mined Alone is more significant than anything else because it means he alone kept bitcoin going. If he had given up at that time, we wouldn't have bitcoin. Someone would have tried to connect, found no blockchain, then given up. Satoshi Mined Alone, and that is why bitcoin still exists. It existed in the first place because of him and it still exists because of him, but I argue that the most significant event surrounding Satoshi is when he Mined Alone. If he had stopped, we'd still have a genesit block. That would still be significant. But if he had stopped, the time when Satoshi Stopped Mining would be the death-date of bitcoin and nothing more. The genesis block would lose value. The white paper would lose value. Pizza day would lose value.
The time that Satoshi Mined Alone is the reason bitcoin continues to exist. It ties the beginning of bitcoin together to the future. Satoshi Mined Alone and we are all here because of it.

They shut it off because they got confused about which half the folks moved into, and they were too stupid to actually confirm someone moved out on our side. They literally just let the new tenants on the other side take over on our side, no confirmation at all. No "How do you do, we notice that you might have moved out, is this accurate?" or anything. Then when those folks "didn't pay the bill" because they weren't getting it because it was coming to us and even when I brought it over to them it somehow still didn't get paid because one half was going unpaid, they shut off the power with this little door-hanger that has a slip-in thing to talk about why, and it had a section for "we are going to come shut your power off soon if you don't pay your bill you damn deadbeat", but they never used that. They just shut it off, no warnings.

Incorrect on the node voting power, actually. Each node has a voting power of exactly 1, regardless of how much hashing power it may have. The accepted chain is what the collective network accepts regardless of how much any one or hundred people hash.
Yes, Ghash can mine lots of blocks and they could even forcefully orphan any block from anywhere else but if they actually did that, the rest of the network would shut GHash out. No blocks would be accepted from GHash and their entire hashing power would be rendered useless.
Bitcoin isn't just the hashing power, it is also what the nodes will accept and transmit. The nods don't have to transmit data from a bad actor. They can't be forced to relay. By default, every node relays everything it receives but if a real bad actor came forward, that would change.
To put this another way: Hashing power is only relevant to the ledger of transactions, data relaying is the actual power to "vote". Ghash doesn't gain the ability to force its will on the network. That can only happen under a distributed control of 51% of the hashing power.
The real 51% attack happens when a bad actor owns hundreds or thousands of individual nodes and has sole control over them, operating them as one though they transmit and relay as thousands. And that is only a danger if, and only if, they has 51% of the nodes at the same time as having 51% of the hashing power.

@_date: 2014-06-08 11:05:54
Also, the scenario you suggest where GHash mines separately for WEEKS would actually push down the global hashrate for both chains and they would eventually desynchronize, folks would leave them because the public-chain is where the actual money is, and even if none of that happened... even if everyone stuck with Ghash and they mined a slightly longer blockchain that wiped out the public-chain's work for days, or weeks, or months...
They just wouldn't get relayed anymore. Because, as my other comment says, the nodes have a vote. Any bad actors will be purged. A truly damaging attack is almost impossible.

It would be far more economical, assuming a bad actor wanted to actually attack the network, to design and produce their own chips. $10M to produce a mask and make several wafers with multiple chip designs. $1M or so to find the most efficient and/or fastest chip(likely the most efficient, if cost is an issue), $10M to produce a new mask optimized for only that single chip, $10M to produce millions of chips, $10M-$15M to produce the hardware for running the chips, $5M for the datacenter to run the hardware. $1M to get thousands of proxies and IPs to switch with every block submitted, to hide the total hashing power available.
If someone wants to attack the bitcoin network, it would only take $50M, a max of $100M. And even then, EVEN THEN, the attack could be stopped. The protocol could be changed so that nodes would REFUSE to transmit blocks that don't include a certain number of transactions, if there are that many in the queue. And then all of that money, all of that work and time, would be completely worthless. I know you haven't been harping on it, but reddit has been in a tizy about the dangers of 51%, and it's just bullshit.
(Also, everyone moved to BTC Guild? Yeah, probably was the Guild spreading all the crap about how awful a 51% attack is, what with their 7.5% fee. Greedy pool-op wants his money.)

There are two aspects to the bitcoin network;
Hashing/proof of work
Ledger keeping/transmission
GHash is, of course, a massive degree of hashing. All the 7400+ bitcoin nodes are the ones that have the actual power. In the event of a bad actor, those nodes will choose what actually propagates. If they choose not to transmit work for GHash, it is like GHash isn't hashing at all. To actually damage the network requires not just 51% of the hashing power but 51% of the nodes.

And that's exactly it, there is no incentive for anyone who wishes for bitcoin to succeed to even abuse that kind of power. GHash, and Cex, are build entirely on mining and profiting from mining. To abuse the network or community at large would ruin what they can earn, it would ruin their entire business. Only previously malicious actors have any reason to get and abuse 51% of the hashrate, and there is only so little that can be done in that way anyway.
@_date: 2014-07-08 00:33:24
Botnets do the same thing ASICs do but on a wider scale because one botnet can be worth 10000 CPUs, or more. So given a choice between "a threat to the security of *coin that is controlled by criminals" and "a threat to the security of *coin that is controlled by corporations that want to profit on *coin by sustaining it", I will choose the latter. If both as inherently bad then pick the lesser of two evils. The only solution is to make an altcoin that mixes ASIC hardware with CPU cycles in a way that makes a botnet worthless(due to lacking the ASIC processing) while also making a massive amount of ASIC hashes worthless(due to being tied to a certain speed of CPU cycles). Ideally it would be some kind of algorithm that can't be split between ASIC hashing and CPU hashing, it would be something that would join the two disparate parts so that even creating a massive CPU botnet that joins that processing with a high-powered ASIC would be worthless. And primarily, the ideal would be some kind of USB-asic as the only thing needed. $10 for the ASIC-part compared to $1500 worth of GPUs, or $500 worth of FPGAs. So it would be readily hashable by small ASICs while creating an inherent bottleneck against large ASICs, and the cost of getting a disproportionate amount of CPUs hashing with the ASICs would make it hard to expand in either direction alone.
ASICs aren't bad. They're the lesser of two evils. A combination that makes bigger-better ASICs worthless AND botnets worthless is the true solution. I don't have the technical know-how, but I know this is the necessary fix. SingularityCoin (Or is it just Singularity?) is a step in the right direction, but it keeps the algorithms separate.

@_date: 2014-06-11 10:43:23
Or reject blocks outright. The bitcoin network works by majority consensus. If 51% of nodes say "this block doesn't get onto the chain" then, by majority rule, that block might as well not exist. And any blocks mined based on that block will also get fucked up and there will be 2chainz and if a merchant is on one, and a different merchant is on the other, you actually can double-spend.
More importantly, it requires node-acceptance to do anything like a rollback or hard fork. Thus, the nodes hold more power because hardforks are generally required when the mined blocks get fucked up in some way. Owning 51% of the nodes means being able to do a hardfork at will.
@_date: 2014-06-11 10:03:25
51% isn't dangerous. Owning 51% of the nodes is dangerous. Owning 51% of the hashing power is not. Owning enough nodes means an attacker could legitimately CRIPPLE the bitcoin network. Owning enough hashrate can't actually do much.

It isn't a threat. The entirely of what can be done is minimal and the lashback for doing it would end Ghash. In turn, the global hashrate would drop. It would actually benefit every miner if GHash did something awful.

The fact that they are telling customers they can't give out refunds for 8 to 12 weeks, after they've already had to wait 4 weeks.

They take a fee under normal operating conditions. That fee, over years, adds up to more than they could take in a cut-and-run. 5% every day is more than everyone on the service in a given day, or even everything that enters the service in a month. Unlike a dealer who might be running on slim margins, SR2 runs on fees for relatively low costs. I'm not advocating the use or existence of SR2 but five years of operations will earn far more than a cut-and-run.

GHash blocks come from a known source and it is remarkably easy to start rejecting that source.
Filtering. It isn't hard to filter bad actors. Ghash would have to start submitting via tor or the like and that just means that full blocks from tor would start to get rejected. There is no way to be a bad actor, have 51% of the network, and not get rejected.

No, that's not how math works. 27% is closer to 25%, one quarter, than it is to 33%, one third. In fact, it is TRIPLE the distance to 33% than to 25%.

No, they'll be accepted as long as they don't fuck with the network. But all this crap everyone is spewing about the "dangers of 51%" for Ghash is crap because any "harm" they can do is negligible and will get them removed from the network by a collective 'vote' of the nodes. Any node/user/pool that is found to be interfering with the network in a negative way can be blacklisted. If Ghash forcefully orphaned all blocks but the ones it mined, it would get blacklisted. If it did double-spends, it would get blacklisted.
Hashing power is control over the ledger, but acceptance of the ledger is left to the nodes. They transmit the data. If less than 50% of the nodes refuse to transmit data from a pool, that pool effectively has no hashing power.
51% requires more than just hashrate, it requires 51% of the nodes.

USA-based bitcoin mining hardware companies all suck. I learned this by being a customer to BFL and CoinTerra, and watching how both have handled their customers and their products. Thankfully, I'm getting a refund on my CoinTerra order... or so they claim. Given the 4 week delay for refunds, and their surprising ability to take and ship new orders so quickly, I don't expect anything.
@_date: 2014-06-08 12:03:41
Because the wiki is stupid. A 51% attack as described in the wiki can't exist with a pool. It takes a single person/group with absolute control. To prevent some valid blocks intentionally would be an exercise in bad faith. A concentrated effort toward that would result in people looking into how to stop or prevent blocks from GHash being relayed. To prevent ALL valid blocks from others would do the same thing, just markedly faster. The nodes have the real control. It takes 51% of the nodes to actually control the network like that. And still, the 49%(public) would find a way to branch off. Even in the worst case, it can do very little damage.
@_date: 2014-06-08 09:30:07
Yes they do. On average they can only find a block every 20 minutes and if they abused ANYthing, anything at all, the entire network would reject them and difficulty would drop by 50%, and we'd all be sitting pretty while half the mining power on the network is made worthless.

BFL denied refunds that they had a legal responsibility to give. They are also just a generally shitty company with a co-founder who was indicted for fraud. But mostly, the refunds-issue. The FTC rules on refunds state that ambiguous wording makes a projected shipping date invalid and the default replacement for that is 30 days. BFL used "2 months or more" and due to the usage of "or more", the date becomes ambiguous and, even at the maximum of 90 days from the time of ordering if combining the 2 months and the FTC's default of 30, they should have given refunds when requested, as well as sending out a notice after 90 days offering a refund or to have the delivery date delayed by 30 days, and then continued to send that notice out every 30 days.
Instead, BFL gave one notice in April that refunds would no longer be allowed and asked everyone to agree with that. Which isn't allowed. BFL isn't showing up in court because they won't win.
So it's far more likely that all of the profits have been embezzled and the Monarchs will never appear.
@_date: 2014-06-18 09:20:11
I don't believe you. Or if I do, it is because your mining rate is so low as to be almost worthless. For a payout to take "many more weeks" would mean you're getting less than 0.04 bitcoins in "many more weeks", which translates to around 25GH/s or so. Practically not worth mining.
@_date: 2014-04-22 12:29:49
What you could do is make your policy super clear that refunds are done based on the price of the item and the current exchange rate. Alternatively, you could hold the bitcoins until a week after the item was ordered, and make a very clear policy that refunds a week after the order is placed will be, once more, based on the price of the item and the current exchange rate, and before that week is over they will be the amount paid minus 0.0001 for the miner fee.

@_date: 2014-06-08 10:20:52
That's not how it works at all. Yes, they could mine without broadcasting blocks then overwhelm the network and be like "all your blocks are orphans, fuckers" but to do that means two networks both mining at half the current total. In other words, two networks mining at roughly 5.5 billion difficulty-worth. This would make both of them slow and Ghash could pick and choose tranactions to accept and then the moment they turn a chain of blocks into orphans everyone would start rejecting them, because GHash blocks come from a known source and it is remarkably easy to start rejecting that source.

You don't seem to understand freedom of speech. Freedom of speech means the government can't prevent you from saying something(except for a very small number of sentences). It is the right that allows reporters to publish whistleblowing reports. Edward Snowden stole information(illegal) and gave it to reporters, who distributed it(legal). That is Freedom of Speech. Having a business refuse to do business over something you say or do? That doesn't violate any rights.

I'm glad I'm not alone, then. I recently read an article about Ripple and Bitcoin that was all kinds of positive about Ripple and when I commented on it the author responded by shunning my concerns and talking about how he'd bought some Ripple with his btc recently. That's why Ripple has been on my mind lately. Seeing the perceived value of Ripple rising so much is just concerned, though. Especially since the company is so atrociously slow in "giving it out", and they plan to hold nearly half of what it ever generates.
The article also touched on that fact, talking about how he thought it was a perfectly fine thing for a company to do because it's no different from what any company would do so what's the harm?

Incorrect. 7.6 Petahash = 7600 Terahash = 7600000 Gigahash = 7600000000 megahash.
7600000000 / 20 = 380,000,000 = The entire US population, according to your numbers, would actually add up to about 40% of the network, when adjusted for the sudden influx of mining power.

We've only just entered the bubble phase. Bitcoin has only just begun to get media attention. As Shang Tsung would put it... "IT HAS BEGUN!"
If you look at value across a 2 year scale, it looks like value just entered the fear/capitulation point and the real value will be $300.
If you look at it across a 6 month scale, it looks like value just entered the fear/capitulation point and the real value will be $600.
But if you look at it in the news, it's clear the value has just entered the first sell off/bear trap/media attention point. The take-off was value rising to $1200. We've only just bear trap in the last few days. Based on this logic... value will, again, be around $600.
Oh, but the price it will be at in the next year... I'm going to make such money. So rich. Very success. No doge.
