Yeah, what happened was weird though, eventually my 2 ETH just showed up in my Coinbase (not gdax) ETH wallet.  
I just got kind of lucky that I noticed in one of the dropdown boxes on GDAX which shows your wallet amount.  This must be some sort of failback when GDAX fails to transfer.  Probably took like 12 hours for it to show up / me to notice

Did your transaction ever go through? Have a transaction where the funds haven't showed up in Binance yet after 12 hours.

I was curious, so I looked for the stats:  (source: IRS, Federal Reserve)
* **Average** American **family savings** account balance: 	**$3,800**
* Percent of working Americans who are **not saving** for retirement: 	**40 %**
* Percent of American families who have no savings at all: 	25 %
* Average amount saved for retirement: 	$35,000
* Average American **household debt** :	**$117,951**
I think if you have $140,000 in a bank account in America, you are a little less likely to be in the middle class.

It's really telling what kind of people are in this subreddit when you see the crying about taxes.
