I feel like it’s a mass of weak hands who just signed up, it dipped, now everyone’s selling day by day. They’re also escalating the FUD significantly because they don’t know what they’re talking about it / or have enough background knowledge. It’s pretty crazy times. I’m predicting btc will hit 7-8k within the next week or so then we’ll see a slow recovery.

On the Coinbase subreddit there are multiple people claiming Coinbase closed their account for no reason. And their customer support is close to non-existent so if something suspicious does happen good luck getting your coin back. Not worth the risk if you want to take it seriously in my opinion.

The dip is not over. Predicted to drop to 3500 within the next few hours.

I’ve noticed a few crypto related number plates around lately in South Aus also.
