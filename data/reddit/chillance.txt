Crap, let me fix that. Uh, how do I edit the post?
Ok, I created a new one, as it doesnt seem I can edit it...
@_date: 2014-03-22 04:54:20
Does this mean one has to redo this because the new code needs to rehash the data and it would be different compared to what it does now?
I'm asking because I'm not sure I should enter mine yet.

Although I agree we need to know what happened, I don't agree with the not starting a reboot. To me, that seems like a really good idea for everybody. Might take a while, but better to get _something_ than nothing, right?

It's not about saving Mt Gox, but helping it's previous users (creditors) which lost a lot of money. And, as it says, it's a win-win. Creditors have a chance to get some of the loss back, while Bitocean gets a huge userbase. Personally I'm not that keen on joining one of the other many new exchanges popping up, because my loss at Mt Gox. With a reboot I sure am more interested!
Also, I and many others are interested in what really happened.
@_date: 2014-07-04 12:31:53
But the "trustee" is well informed about your intentions, right?
@_date: 2014-03-26 20:43:34
What happened to the issues? It's gone, and I can't see any commit with it.. ?
@_date: 2014-03-18 05:12:33
True, but the site gives you Bitcoin. And, you buy and sell the hashes with BTC. Will probably provide with the other alt. coins too in the future.

When you say restart seems impossible, what about ProjectGox then?
And if there are no more worthy assets, what are we wasting time on then?
What I would like to see is someone (maybe you?) that could get up something stated here  
I would have done it myself if 1. I had the time, but more importantly 2. Had the database proof of what everybody has.

(I'm updating this comment as time goes with interesting information about the site)
I included my referral link there too, so if you want to help me getting some of my BTC I lost at mtgox, I would appreciate it. Note that the % is not taken from you so you don't loose anything by using it.
Now, about the site. You can read more about it here:  and updates and questions and answers can be found here: 
There is also a chat on the site where you can get answers, and there is an unoffical channel on freenode  ( or use this  )
Now, reason I post about it is because it's the first site I feel is promising. Again, **don't invest more than you can afford to loose!!** But, so far everything seems legit. Just check the forums I posted and you can see that the guy "TheCleanGame" is really active answering peoples questions. Supposedly he was hired and started Monday doing just this. I also talked to "Admin" the other day, and so far he's been quite open and answers made sense. We both are tired of all the BTC scammers...
I've invested some, and managed to withdraw as well. Not a big sum though. And "Admin" (owner) was quick answering my support question.
Info given from "TheCleanGame" about the company:
It's a company in **Curitiba, Brazil** named **MKT Tecnologia da Informação**.  All paperwork filed, all taxes paid.
Some good pointers:
* You get income every 10 minutes.
* You spend no time tending your khs here.
* You pay no electricty fees or replace broken hardware
* You spend no time looking for pools that pay and are competitive
* No spending time selling obsolete hardware
* No time exchanging coins for btc or whatnot
* You can buy khs today, run for a day, and sell tomorrow with most likely positive income. Really small, but you are not locked in with a contract.
* They have sold about 8% I think of their hashes from their farm, and will most likely only go up to maybe 15% or so, which means they will generate quite much for themselves
Also, this is my opinion, but compared to only mining one coin where you are bound to the difficulty, which likely decreases the khs value. Here it will change coin, so it won't have the same affect. At least not for a while.
How it will look later when it goes more official:

Exactly. Maybe we all who lost will not get everything back, but at least it would be something.. over time... so just hang in there I suppose?
@_date: 2014-03-12 23:52:28
Well, join  on IRC freenode.
@_date: 2014-03-23 08:06:45
Could you guys add the possiblity to remove or better yet update with new email? Or that breaks this whole idea? I guess it shouldnt because if you login to your mtgox account, your username there will be unique and verify that it's you.
Edit: After looking at the code.. so you use the email as the key? Why not the username?
@_date: 2014-03-18 02:15:07
What? I don't have to use the USB dongle? :P
@_date: 2015-01-13 10:12:51
Also, it's not certain that Mt. Gox was a scam. Sure, maybe some insider stole it ( but that doesn't make it a scam. Stop using words the wrong way just to make a shocking headline.
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:42:10
I feel you. If it helps, many are in the same boat. People using their 1-10 BTC for small things. Made sense at the time, but if they would have kept it, they would probably have a lot now. I had the damn QT client open back in 2010. Even pressed that "mining" button. I had an old PC then so, nothing came out of it then. I wonder myself what would have happened if it did.. Thing also to keep in mind is that even if you had plenty, there have been many ways to lose it. MtGox is one big example where many did too.
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:50:43
Yes, I'm thinking that most likely one would have gone to MtGox with the bitcoins at $1000 worth as it was at one point there, as it would make you a millionaire to sell it off. The thing that bothers me with that though is that the question how many you would put there. As you are probably aware, A LOT of bitcoins were lost there, as it was the biggest and dare I say also quite trusted back then.
@_date: 2017-08-23 22:14:28
So, someone will send from the MtGox address that was recovered? ;)
Btw, you don't activate your bitcoin wallet. There is no such thing.
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:17:36
This is actually a very good point that many miss. But it's so easy to fall into the "what if" trap being in current moment. I do the same.
@_date: 2017-09-03 12:23:22
That first sentense is something I haven't heard before. It's very true though.
Also, it relates to the situation where say you have 10000 BTC, and price is $1, possibly reaching $10, many would be scared it could drop and would sell off. This applies to all different kind of situations like this throughout the time since it started. Only if you completely forgot about it (or being greedy as you say) for a while and came back later you could possibly have had your BTC still.
