Bisq has no traffic and you can’t turn a f2f illicit transaction into an order book. They need web access and regular listings.

My accounts were taken over using this method.  T-Mobile has since upped their procedure for verifying customers. Total pain in the ass but Didn’t get a dime from me because I used a Trezor.

With what payment method 
@_date: 2018-10-06 23:36:10
Since bitfinex has no real banking usdt has no liquidity which means the only way to leave usdt is to buy bitcoin pushing the price up on usdt exchanges, then maybe sell your Btc on an exchange a real banking.

Of course! Need to spend all stolen btc from scam capital of the world.
@_date: 2019-08-11 19:44:48
Definitely not the best way. Totally fake news. I love bitcoin but it’s not the best way to send “money” unless you want to lose 10%+ to exchange fees.
@_date: 2019-08-26 00:28:09
I never said all or most. I said a huge percentage comes from there, and they do. They don’t scam stupid westerners, they scam disabled people, old people, mentally ill people, people who are stupid enough to fall for it, the weakest people. You’re obviously a racist so stfu what is the point of your comments. Nigerians are notorious for being scammers, and there is good reason.
@_date: 2019-08-26 04:17:11
@_date: 2019-08-25 20:28:34
Haha it’s not data it’s firsthand experience from my old business, romance scams, check scams, wire fraud, Ebay fraud, PayPal fraud, a huge percentage comes from Nigeria. Go post an ad online for money transfer services on Paxful or localbitcoins  and see what ip addresses start spamming you.

probably will get ordered to repay at value when he stole them ��
@_date: 2018-11-03 23:51:37
my point is that previous case law points to cases like this being settled based on the value of the coin when the loss occurred, not its present value 
@_date: 2018-11-17 00:53:58
activity is high because of price.

@_date: 2018-12-19 01:57:46
what's really happening here is you are receiving fraudulent funds. After you withdraw the cash and send it to someone else, the money will  be reversed out of your bank and you will be -$xxxx... but you will still have the "small reward" !!
Interested to know how you came across this offer.
@_date: 2019-05-01 04:56:58
Why don’t you read the indictment of the guys just arrested for lying to banks. Don’t do it. It’s bank fraud. Get a better bank that doesn’t harass you about every transaction. Most local credit unions don’t ask or don’t care, if they do ask, don’t lie.
