Living in Southern California, I have to say that this meme is an argument in favor of Bitcoin Cash. All of those "fixes" in real life have just lead to more congestion....

Well, it's still over 9000....

Taking a small piece of a concept out of context and using it to argue against increased capacity as a whole IS pseudoscience. 
Induced demand is a thing - but it doesn't outweigh the need to increase supply in response to actual demand. Imagine if that applied to food. You have more hungry people, but if you increase the food supply, it will ONLY increase demand. So don't do that!
Trying to claim that increasing lanes in LA won't help relieve congestion because of induced demand (and one CARPOOL lane didn't help) is flat out ridiculous.
Using that argument for Bitcoin is equally ridiculous. There is a problem - it needs to be addressed. Just because the people in favor of increasing blocksize had a shitty idea for implementation doesn't mean you reject all ideas to increase blocksize on the basis of a shoddy argument.
Hell, that's what is wrong with American politics now - if the solution sounds even remotely like something your opponent suggested, you have to bend over backwards and ignore common sense to prove that the argument is wrong.
That's what you see on both sides in American politics. That's why they won't build regular lanes or freeways in SoCal. And it's what is happening with this whole btc/bch thing.

Well, when it drops below 9000, that will give the Vegata fans something to look forward to again.

The Vox article is mostly garbage. The 405 lane widening they cited was for a carpool lane, not a normal lane. It also doesn't account for the increasing population and the lack of actual capacity increases over the last several decades. 
I am not saying increased capacity is the solution to all problems, but to discount it entirely for political reasons and then try to use pseudoscience and logical fallacy to argue that it makes congestion worse... that's just ridiculous. Properly implemented, increased capacity DOES reduce congestion.

Now to figure out where to put the rest of the BTC I have on there, so I can have access to the next fork sooner...

I love it - I just set up my Gemini account this morning before the drop, and it is still verifying. Coinbase is fried.
Should have done this last week when I was first thinking about it.

We are in the same boat. It looks like I made the right call looking elsewhere - I so regret procrastinating.

Looks about right to me.

Coinbase crashing is a great way to stop the drop.

Not sure about the logic of putting savings in a volatile vehicle that has the added pressure of uncertainty depressing the price. Probably unwise on your part.
If things are so tight for you that $30 short term hurts that bad, I'd sell now and NOT reinvest until things are better for you. Don't put anything in an investment you aren't willing to lose. Get an insured savings account.

But, I made money when I sold, and then bought at the bottom.
So, lesson learned!
