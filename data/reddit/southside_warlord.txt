That's basically what I said
If you are unable to subscribe to the IPO, you then are forced to buy your shares after the market opens.
Many IPO's "open" far higher than the subscription price. The demand for COIN shares should cause a huge gap-up on the open.

It's getting kinda late for them to pull the S-1.
The market action suggests otherwise, especially those large purchases several days ago at approx 1800-1820 Hrs EDT. Price went from $1100 to $1130 in just a couple of minutes. That was a "conviction buy" by somebody.

Ratz....out of free articles this month.

You're sales are reported, you need to provide the cost of the assets you've sold.
@_date: 2016-12-28 15:34:43
Maybe, maybe not.

If I add the Ledger S account into Mycelium in order to monitor it, are the funds still "unavailable" with the Nano S. I'd love to be able to monitor my holdings, but don't want them available on my phone for security reasons.

What is this???
@_date: 2017-04-29 16:34:59
So if I add the account, I can see the balance, but the coins are un-spendable?

Gold is up $12, no change in XBT

Some consider Bitcoin a semi-hard asset. Just interesting that it didn't have a price spike (even if short lived)
@_date: 2017-04-25 04:45:41
Totally agree.

I suspect a negligible affect. That is an exchange issue, not a Bitcoin issue.
@_date: 2017-04-25 12:44:29
Doesn't affect Bitcoin. I don't blame China for closing down the scam coins (Litecoin not included)

How does Perianne Boring stay in this space?

Hahaha.....I glance at charts, but more importantly I always buy the dips. I really believe that buying when everybody is selling is the best way to increase the size of your holdings.

I trust Bobby more than I trust the logic of your statement.
@_date: 2017-04-25 18:38:01
Most of them are scam coins.
@_date: 2017-04-07 01:49:08
Thanks, next time I'll put it there.
@_date: 2017-04-25 04:02:52
Just change it if you think it is too low for your purposes.
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:28:24
Great read, thanks for writing it and good luck in your trading.

Sometimes it sucks to come late to the party

It also makes it a lot easier for large-money interests to short Bitcoin. I hope it is rejected again.

I think all of the exchanges are swamped with new user applications, and the support staff is unprepared for this kind of volume.
@_date: 2017-05-11 17:34:23
You can always tell who the newbs are.
@_date: 2017-05-11 17:33:11
Good advice.

Bitcoin is less volatile than crude oil.

He's been bashing Bitcoin for a long time. I wonder how many subscribers he's lost.

Dumb ass

I'm insensitive to the price anymore. If it drops, I'll add more to my position. I'm a long-bull hodler.

Bitcoin DOES NOT need an ETF. Look at how gold and silver are manipulated because of derivatives. An ETF would just start Bitcoin down that same path.

Call them up and tell them you've changed your mind.
