From my understanding as well, the lightning network keeps bouncing these transactions until one of the parties wants their Bitcoin, therefore closing the channel. So if I'm not gonna buy anything from Newegg again and want my Bitcoin, thats when the transactions are broadcast to the network.

From my understanding, its not wallet funds on an exchange. You don't own any keys for your tokens on an IOU, just a balance. You never own your tokens or coins when you hold them on an exchange.
For example, when you login to your bank account, you don't own that physical bill. However, when you go to a bank or an ATM, they own the physical currency and see how much they owe you, so they give you theirs. 
Once again, as its told time and time again...."DON'T. HOLD. YOUR. COINS. ON. EXCHANGES!!!!!" Buy a hard wallet or a software wallet or ANYTHING and when you buy any coin, realize that anything you leave on their servers can be lost in an instant. If you hadn't researched Mt Gox and still trusted buggy ass Kraken, your fault.

I never said thats what I wanted. I want an app with Segwit support and an app that I can adjust the fees. Airbitz looks like it supports both.

This is infuriating. Their entire subreddit used to be questions and support with blogs and now everybody is talking about Bread token.
They still haven't implemented Segwit support nor a way to extract Bitcoin Gold. I love my hardware wallet but I don't want to carry my laptop and hw everywhere to transact with Segwit

Then you sell the house for 15 bitcoin which is trading at $20,000 for a home value of $300,000 in FIAT and then you wait till new ATH of bitcoin at $40,000 and now you have $600,000. So then you sell 7.5 bitcoin for $300,000 and then use 7.5 bitcoin to buy the house and now you have well over a million dollars and the same house.
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:31:10

Its been insufferable. Moved a small amount of money over from another exchange to buy some Ripple and it took 90 minutes to post to my account even though I had 9 confirmations within 20 minutes. Then once it posted, I can't even log back in to do anything with it.

Anyone that uses a credit card pays a 1.51% plus $.10 fee, but the fee is covered by the merchant. 
So if you go buy a $1000 TV, the merchant would pay a $15.20 fee with Visa used or $.10 if they used Bitcoin.

Sell your bitcoin, buy etheruem, and transfer it out to another exchange that supports segwit. Then use that etheruem you transferred in, sell it for bitcoin and VOILA! You have a segwit friendly transaction. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:56:14
This....isn't how price works, unless I'm missing something here.
If I give an exchange $10,000 for 1btc, then I trade that 1btc for 5 bcash tokens, that doesn't make the price go down for btc nor does it make the price of bcash go up, unless shapeshift or whoever converted my crypto to fiat.

@_date: 2017-08-23 18:29:08
It's not?  
Your argument is flawed strictly due to the fact that retirement funds and mutual funds are managed. I can go on any online stock broker and pay a maximum of $10 a trade, no matter the size of the purchase order. Bitcoin is designed as a world wide currency with no middle man (the banks). By charging ridiculous fees for every transaction and for buying bitcoin, you're more than nickel and diming your users. You're at the point of dollar and $2 dollar your users.

I understand this argument but fees need to be lower for this to work. If you're to buy something for let's say $1000, you'd spend about $5 on fees. Then to rebuy on Coinbase, a of today, that's $14.90 in fees, then to get it out of Coinbase its another $4 or so. You just added $25 in fees, just to spend your own HODL money.

I bought in at $2500 last year. Honestly, I have new life goals to pay for, including down payments and that money is cash now. I sold at $5k and paid off all debts. It’s like sitting at a blackjack table with $100, and next thing you know you have $700 in front if you, but instead of walking away, you play some more. Now I had $200 and got up, doubling what I sat down with. 
I believe in the tech, but the greed from people like Ver really turned me off. I’m tired of the forks and just making new money out of thin air with every fork. The bitcoin and bcash fork irked me then the ridiculous amount of alt coins and forks of alt coins made me realize blockchain is amazing, but the currency principle is still manipulated by greed of the devs. Also Ver is shit.

This has happened with ETH for as long as I can remember. The highest it ever hit was below $400. I bet if I set an order where I continuously sold at $335 and then bought when it dipped to $300 from now till next year, I'll be a 6 figga trada

I was about to buy on Coinbase 3 days ago but transferred the funds from saving on GDAX to see if it would be available right away.
It wasn't, and because of that, I'm getting a $500 discount per coin.

I don't get it again. If you have an SPV wallet and own your own keys, instead of navigating thru the fork, why wouldn't you put your coins on Coinbase and in the vault and come out on the other side of the fork with 2 coins with no bullshit of tethering to nodes, hoping to come out on top?
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:48:51
No. I explained how Bitcoin works. How cryptocurrency works, and how it is the future. One friend decided to hop in the market via an exchange at $4700. I think he's mad at me. 
He was interested about it before but when you're a hodler, you tend to hype shit up, ya know?

@_date: 2017-10-09 18:05:17
Most people will say a ledger or trezor. Some will say use bread wallet or mycelium. It depends how secure you want to be.
All I can say is DO NOT store anything on your laptop or desktop. Find a wallet, WRITE down your private key and write it down in 2 locations. DO NOT type out the paper wallet on your computer and then print it (you can be hacked this way). Write one key in an accessible place like in a book and maybe one on a sheet of paper in a fire proof safe.  
Then HODL

From what I've been reading and following, "Potentially necessary" sounds greedy so you can split your coins on both forks.
The only downside I can see here is that if Bread is stuck on the 2x fork and its devalued, then hodlers are kinda fucked.
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:58:09
How does this work btw? Did you make that certificate? Does she just scan that and she has money after she exposes the private key?

Antonopoulos has said that mobile wallets is one of the safest way to store your coins as opposed to you computer because there isn't as much malware on your phone because of the security of the mobile OS. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:09:24
I always hear never hold them on exchanges and only use hardware wallets.
Aren't mobile wallets like Bread, Electrum, and so on and so forth that give you a private key the same? Couldn't I fundamentally open an Electrum wallet, write down the 12 word private key, transfer Bitcoin in there and delete Electrum till I need it again?
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:29:05
This doesn't work. If you bought 10 coins at $500, you have $5000. Now its $5000 you have 1 coin, its worth $5000. The difference is you still have the same purchase power with that coin.
When you bought it at $500, a real doll would have cost you 10 coins. Now, it would cost you 1 coin. Its still the same purchase power if you're not just using Bitcoin for hodling.
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:27:35

The fees add up over time. 
$7 in fees to buy then fee to send it to offline wallet is like, $11. If you do that over 6 months, you're looking at $100 in fees to just get bitcoin and store it on a ledger. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:06:46
Adding security would be getting a hardware wallet.

Buying a used car for a few grand will only lead you to buying another used car for a few grand a few years later when it breaks down and a never ending cycle. You need a home loan to buy a $150,000 house unless you have 40 bitcoin laying around to do so, which you'd need to exchange to FIAT to purchase.

Do you have any other friends with bitcoin? You can privately send each other bitcoin thru electrum or breadwallet or any other software or paper wallet. Its only from the exchange that its taking forever. Try sending like $.001 from Coinbase to your wallet. Give it about 12 hours and if you're positive that your computer isn't bugged, send the btc to your electrum wallet
Make sure to write down your Electrum seed and make sure that the address you're copy pasting from Coinbase to Electrum is exactly the same (there is malware that changes the wallet address when you copy/paste).

@_date: 2017-07-28 17:26:19
Everyone here is saying Electrum, but Electrum is only on Android or OSX and Andreas said that laptops are the least secure of any device and to use your cellphone.
So for iPhone users, BreadWallet seems to be the winner.

As someone who has so many wallets, I'm kind of dumbfounded how bread wallet is so simple yet most secure. 
Another question, what prevents hackers from just typing in 12 words to access a wallet. For example, if I typed in 12 random words, how does that prevent me from just opening someone's wallet and accessing those coins?
@_date: 2017-06-13 16:54:40

Is it also a more secure wallet?
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:43:30
With this train of thought, I'd think people who are hodling would sell, wait for the drop, then rebuy at the dip.
Then again, transaction fees would be 100s of dollars.

Is there a difference from acquiring bitcoin from places like Coinwallet and paying those exuberant fees and the transactions?
At a certain point, you run out of bitcoins when spending. So let's say I want to buy bitcoin and use it as a direct deposit. If I'm spending $40 to just convert my paycheck to bitcoin, it gets expensive after a while.
