Gold and it's little Bro Silver have been a safe haven for 5000 years. ''Don't listen to Kim's pump &amp; dumps'' - Your personnel opinion of Kim clouds your judgement. Gold, Silver and it's Digital Cousin BTC will outlive any amount of ad hominems you can spew from your lips. Pump &amp; Dump? Those who have studied the history of precious metals can only shake their collective heads at such sciolistic proclivities.

Since the 2008 crash there hasn't been a single banker who went to jail. Thousands of people lost their houses and money. This was in a regulated world. $500 Billion + has been stolen by bankers who are regulated by the way, over the last 5 years. HSBC got caught working with the Mexican drug cartels and their regulated fines were far less than the profit they made. As I write this, HSBC's relationship with the cartels continues unabated. Where are your regulators? Talk to the DEA Agents, Police officers whose fellow officers have died as a result of this regulated Drug Lord ponzeship. Ask them what your regulators are doing for the families. Anyone who believes in the system we now live under is indeed delusional. All you 'Time to reconsider the Luddism folk' will be proven wrong with time and I don't mean decades. 
Having said that, here's a short message for Mr. Voorhees, stick to the cryptographic/math aspect of the Bitcoin protocol and ditch the Obi-Wan stuff. Someone who espouses decentralized networks and then throws away what is going to be Millions in future market value, to the very centralized MTGox cannot preach to the Luddites. It comes across like a fool preaching relationship advice after he got caught in an extramarital affair. A true leader in the Bitcoinsphere, or any sphere for that matter, sticks to what he knows. At least for now Erik, Math....Yes....Jedi....No!

So I'm reading this and shaking my head at the insanity of leaving, what would have been in a few years millions of dollars [Possibly 100's of millions] in the hands of a centralized exchange. 550 BTC? Really? I remove all my coins [Probably worth no more than 2 BTC in total Current Price] as soon as I trade for them. I'm thinking to myself who is this fool, then I get to the bottom of the post and read -Erik Voorhees? The same Erik Voorhees that made Peter Schiff sound antiquated. The very same Erik Voorhees to whom I listen to on my MP3 player several times a week?  Wow this is making me ill.

The protocol needs a value incentive linked to the mining process. No one will mine without one. The Bitcoin tech is with us forever, no one can change that. We wont go back to horse and buggy and future folk in flying machines wont revert back to the cars we use today. The power of the protocol to give the world banks without bankers, contracts without lawyers, immutable proof of ownership, a decentralized centric peer to peer global power structure is such a positive change that the existing way of doing things will be rendered antiquated. Once the protocol becomes user friendly for the masses it will explode, and I believe so to will the currency.

Even if she did it, she would have cashed out ASAP, which means this article would still exist but she would be lamenting how she should have not cashed out
