I even had the client application on my desktop for my bitcoin wallet it was the one with the yellow B and the dollar sign behind it.

I was in the Air Force at that time I was definitely way younger when I bought it.. it was on the news and everything on my grandpas big screen. I played neopets built websites with geocities and played around with google when it wasn't huge and had its old bevelled text .. uhh and I played diablo 2 lord of destruction and Warcraft 3 frozen throne on their computers but that might have been a little later on.

I'm not trolling.. seriously i bought them but I don't remember when I did I just remember i bought $60 dollars very early on and had a wallet and everything and I used my grandfathers debit card to purchase them. It was on their old Intel white tower no side window and it had a liteon CD burner drive in it. I also had Warcraft 3 on it and diablo 2.

I think I remember seeing wallet.dat.. Damn it was so long ago.. neopets and geocities myspace even era.. yeah I had asked my grandparents a while back what happened to their computers they said they have them away but I asked again today and my grandmother said they kept all the hard drives.. fingers crossed either there is some remnants of me purchasing the bitcoins if I didn't put them in the wallet or if I did some remnants of that.. I was pretty young and didn't understand crypto currency really at the time I just wanted some because I thought it was cool.
