Wonderful live wallpaper :o)
I've got the winter scene going.  
I hope this gets the word out for you and many more sales come your way as the days go on.

Congratulations and welcome :o).  
I just made the plunge myself a few days ago. 
Careful though, I've found myself spending more time in this and other bitcoin-related subreddits than I do on r/all heheheh.

Here's a good place to start:
Let me sum up:
You can request an account from the bot and it creates a wallet for you.  You can deposit/withdrawl from said wallet to/from your primary bitcoin address. Once funded you can tip to your heart's content. 
[Here's the Quick Start Guide](

This one is in the UK

Suggestions in here:
There's actually a few more here:  
I've never bought any from any of these guys so I can't speak for them.  I am also NOT affiliated with any of these sites.  Just helping out ;o)
Congrats on the new business possibilites!
@_date: 2013-11-22 12:21:07
I'll definitely be buying more.  :o)
Would've, could've, should've...we've all got those; heheheheh

Just looked at your whois info.  Might want to renew soon.  It expires in 6 months from what I can tell.

OCH! 
When do we all stop mentally kicking ourselves in the ass for 20/20 hindsight?

I claimed mine today.  
Great setup!  My first transaction with bitpay and it was so easy! 
Great prints and all are reasonably priced.
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:16:29
Hey! That first one is the question I posed.
Heh! I'm somewhat relevant :o)
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:40:01
...or something.  haven't slept yet and it is nearly 8AM PST.
Anyhoo..You seem in great spirits. Hopefully your mood goes UP from there. To the moon!
Also...I don't get it.  I saw it yesterday and couldn't figure it out.  I was hoping the top comment would have an explanation.  I guess that doesn't reall work on the smaller subs.
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:46:51
I'd like to have the name of this faucet if you still have it.
edit:  I didn't notice you had it hyperlinked.  Thanks.  Faucet's closed, though.

I have a feeling we'll be seeing more of him.  Possibly Good Morning America, Today Show, Late Show guest, Ellen...etc...
Maybe an AMA, even.
Reddit has created celebrities with less to work with.
I say good for him.  He's going to have a GREAT holiday season and a grin that won't stop for ages.  
@_date: 2013-11-26 05:57:15
I did my first puchase through coinbase. Easy peasy.  
Keep in mind though, it seems the standard turn around is 1 (one) week for a first purchase.

Thanks for the well wishes!
Good luck to you as well!

Congrats, Bud! It's a start. We all have to start somewhere.
That's an interesting screencap. What bitcoin 'ledger' are you using?

You're welcome! 
Ummmm.... This is kinda embarassing.  I'm not really sure where you go from there.  Check out @_date: 2013-11-28 20:30:46
I think your work is quite amazing.  It pleases and amuses me.  It would be fricking amazing to be wandering around and come across your work.
Do you have any plans to travel and 'tag' other areas?  U.S. specifically.
Continue on, Friend!

Thank you very much.
When I crash later tonight  I'll listen to it again.
You've good taste, you.

I use 
 
I have the main page loaded in a tab in the background and you get about .00000100 bitcoins /hr (don't quote me, i haven't actually been paying attention) 
At the top of the page there is a link to various faucets.  It opens up a frame and you cycle through them.  
It is a nice diversion during commercial breaks.  Keep in mind a lot of these pages have a minimum payout level.

Great idea!
I'm doing something similar. My buddies and I would go have a few pints after work 3-4 days a week.  We've all agreed to slow it down and go out 1 day a week (no more than 2).    
All the money I'm saving NOT spending it out at the bar will be earmarked for savings/Bitcoin rewards.
The hindsight kicks in though: 'What if I had done this starting LAST year?!? I would have so much room for ~~activites~~ Bitcoins!' lol
Good luck to you in your investments and (hopefully) healthful eating!

Buy! BUy! BUY!
I think that's the general consensus.
I missed out when it was $10 apop.  Not going to do it again. 
 If Bitcoin does crash to $1 and stays, I'll finally be able to buy a few Casascius coins :o)

Over $4000USD for most likely less than 15 seconds worth of 'work'.

The right celebrity endorsements can be quite positive.
I've been wondering the last few days what ~~would have to say about bitcoin.

This is what I did. Learn from my mistakes.  Seasoned BitCoin veterans can point and laugh :o)
Bitcoin faucets?  I used a few.  Over the course of a few days, many hours and a bout of insomnia I was able to rack up a whopping .00071224 btc.  (at current prices that's about .60cents USD)  Still...free money ;o)
If you want to see what these micro transactions look like use blockchain and take a look at the history:
 I heard the easiest way to get USD to BTC is to use VirWox.  Set up an account. Deposit using your Paypal/CC/Bank.  Convert USD to virtual world Linden cash.  Convert Linden cash to BTC.  It worked.  Just took the better half of a day after all said and done.  There are  A LOT of fees associated with this.  I'm sure larger transactions fees can be minimized but not great for toe dipping.  I was impatient and used this method.  All in all I probably lost about $3 USD in fees going from Paypla to VirWox and Bank Acct to VirWox and then into BTC just for a $25 USD order.  Live and learn.  
Another way I was able to get BTC was to sign up on Coinbase, link my bank account verify info, and then purchase BTC.  Less fees involved.  First transaction, as I understand it, takes a few days. My first transaction  Created Friday Nov, 22 2013 at 02:28AM PST and should complete on Friday Nov, 29 2013 at 02:28AM. Is this normal? I don't know. Perhaps  someone with more experience could chime in. 
I'm still learning.  It is a lot of fun. I am very excited to be following in the footsteps of the Bitcoin pioneers and this new land of cryptocurrency.
Hopefully this is somewhat helpful.

It really is quite the time sink.  You're doing hours of work over the period of a week or two for mayhaps a buck or so.
Let me see if I've got this right:

Thanks for the reply! 
Once I've got a respectable amount in each wallet I think I'm going to convert them into paper wallets. 
I guess on the plus side I can denote specific uses for the wallets.  i.e. investments, play, work, charity, etc.

From one smoker to another: Good Luck!
I like your idea.  I'll be mulling this over myself.  The money being thrown away on cigarettes instead going towards BTC (or anything else, really) is a good idea.  
Heheheh... Honestly this isn't a new idea. When I first started smoking one of the arguments was 'If you put X amount of money towards widgets instead of smokes you would have $XXXX.XX at the end of the year.'
I've heard cold-turkey works more effectively than quitting with the use of cessation aids. (Citation needed)  Some say e-cigs, patches, vaporizers can help. (There's an e-cig retailer I heard that takes Bitcoin :o)  Use the search feature, I canna remember their name)
If you do decide to use Chantix as Free_Will suggested (he actually said champix) please do research.  I've heard some doozies regarding negative effects.  Right up there with the Ambien Walrus.
In all seriousness, Good luck!

Spreading happiness as you do is comendable.
