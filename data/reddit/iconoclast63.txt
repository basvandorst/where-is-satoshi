Both of you set up online poker accounts. Make a deposit using Bitcoin. Do a player to player transfer of chips. Your friend can then find a group where players exchange for Paypal and sell the chips. 
It's a pain in the ass but it would technically work.

While I appreciate your perspective and somewhat agree, I think it goes beyond that. People at the top of the food chain are sincerely convinced that preserving the status quo helps everyone. Many years ago I got into a discussion with a big shot banker about debt-based money and the fractional reserve system. I had had more than a few beers and was being adamant that banks creating money to lend was a fraud and it should be a crime. He finally had enough of my indignation and lost his temper. He then began screaming at me that allowing banks to create money was the only way the economy would work because it was the incentive, the profit motive underpinning the system. He was CERTAIN that, even though it allowed banks to sit like a parasite atop the economic system and conferred enormous privileges and advantages to the select few, it was still the best system for everyone. 
That is how I imagine Krugman is too.

“Banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin. The bankers
own the earth. Take it away from them, but leave them the power to
create deposits, and with a flick of the pen they will create enough
deposits to buy it back again. However, take it away from them, and all
the great fortunes like mine will disappear and they ought to disappear,
for this would be a happier and better world to live in. But, if you wish
to remain the slaves of the bankers and pay the cost of your own slavery,
let them continue to create deposits.”

I love this story. My primary support for Bitcoin has been it's deflationary character from the start. American's are too far removed from the memory of a stable/deflationary currency that many of our ancestors enjoyed in the 19th century. The idea that the value of your money remains constant or even appreciates over time is something beyond many peoples ability to truly understand. 
If our money, or store of value, remains stable, you're already making a profit against fiat. If it actually increases in value, you are becoming more wealthy with the simple passage of time. 
This phenomena is in direct contradiction to the status quo, where the parasites on the economy have designed a system which slowly siphons value out of the economy and your pocket. 
I hope more people will wake up to this.

Eh? Taken directly from the article: 


Dawnay added that even though the sovereign money idea will not currently be adopted, "blockchain technology could be how the Swiss government could try to bring debt free new money into the economy.”
Switzerland has been referred to as the “Crypto Nation,” namely thanks to its crypto-hub in Zug and its friendly tax laws that attract crypto-related companies. Last week, Zug announced that it will be running a blockchain-powered municipal trial vote this summer, allowing citizens to vote on local issues using their mobile devices.

Debt free state currency has always worked well until the banksters shut it down. The Continental was successful in the colonies until the British flooded the economy with  counterfeits. The Greenback was successful until Congress started limiting it's convertibility. Tally Sticks were money in England for 900 years. 
Turning over control of the currency to private banks is the  basis of the boom bust cycle. Debt is forced into the economy until the onslaught of defaults forces a crash and bailout, then it resets and starts all over again.

A trader doesn't need to take possession of the asset in which he invested in order for the asset to have intrinsic value. It's a derivative instrument meaning it DERIVES it's value from the underlying asset.

"Asset" is too vague a descriptor, in my opinion. For something to be an asset it should have some kind of intrinsic value or utility. Gold is an asset because gold has an industrial utility as well as being very scarce and historically sought after. What, then, is Bitcoin's intrinsic value or utility? Arguably Bitcoin is valuable because it's decentralized and therefore beyond the control and/or manipulation by any central authority. The utility it offers is it's fungibility. This characteristic is the double edged sword that makes the market so volatile. As long as the regulatory landscape is fluid and evolving, questions of it's fungibility will influence it's trading value. 
For these reasons I believe that calling it a currency, or at least a potential currency, is fair.

The FED destroys money by selling debt. If that's what you mean.

The Bureau of Printing and Engraving prints the money then sells it, for the manufacturing cost (pennies per bill), to the FED banks who then distributes it to their *privately owned* regional banks. It's then delivered to commercial banks based on need and exchanged for adjustments in their reserve accounts.

"Paying" your bank is the least of it. Legally speaking, when you deposit money into a bank, you're making them a loan. From the moment it goes into the bank until the moment you withdraw it, your money belongs to them. This explains the concept, though now seemingly archaic, of bank failures. When a bank fails it can and will legally refuse to make you whole and it does so *because* you have loaned them the money. It's *not* criminal or fraudulent to default on a loan. Were the bank holding *your* money for safe keeping then they would be committing a crime by losing it. 
And I haven't even started on the fractional reserve aspect of it yet. 
@_date: 2018-07-23 03:01:25
The process you're describing, while true, does not impact the money supply. Retired cash is replaced with new bills. The FED reduces the money supply by selling debt through Open Market Operations. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 13:23:18
The FED was created in 1913. Which isn't to say that those behind the FED haven't been working for centuries to build their system of private central banks. The blockchain has, in fact, been a technological breakthrough that could revolutionize the global monetary system but it won't happen without a very powerful resistance. The most powerful weapon, other than the military, that the establishment has is the concept of "legal tender". As long as Federal Reserve Notes are the only accepted payment for debts due the government, any other currency will take a back seat. Of course, we can still trade cryptos among ourselves, but there will remain the hurdle of converting it to FRN's at some point.

Where does it come from? 
@_date: 2018-07-22 06:50:32
You'll find that the FED monetizes, primarily, government debt. Since it does this by simply increasing the balance in the Treasury's check book,  it "prints-free-money". By contrast, when the FED sells debt into the private sector it "retires" the proceeds of the sale after taking it's earned income off the top. This is how it prevents runaway inflation. This is how it "manages" the money supply. It buys debt, increasing the money supply, driving down the rates. It sells debt, decreasing the money supply, and driving up the rates. They call it "Open Market Operations" and it takes place at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, a *privately* owned company.

And here in the U.S., it's F.D.I.C. for $250k. So the taxpayer covers the loss, NOT the bank. It's called "moral hazard". Because of the misdeeds of the banking industry which led to the Great Depression bank lobbyists persuaded politicians to use taxpayer money to cover the losses. Never allowing the structure of the system to be called into question. We would, even on the heels of such a calamity, continue to hand over the ownership of our deposits, and they would continue to lose those deposits without consequence. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 23:57:36
The question we need to ask is if we need a national currency? From the 1830's to 1913 we had no single national currency, except during the brief experiment with Greenbacks during the Civil War. Until 1873 (the Coinage Act of 1873 demonetized silver) gold and silver coins and certificates were accepted as payment for government debts while at the same time private banks issued their own notes which were traded at face value or discounted depending on the reputation of the bank. These notes would have been converted to gold or silver to pay taxes, but were usually an acceptable local currency with their given communities. 
The point is that, even considering the volatility of Bitcoin price, it can and should be used as not only currency but also a store of value. It never needs to become a national currency to serve that role. In fact, I would never expect it to be a primary basis for commerce because of Gresham's Law, which states that "bad money drives out good". In essence, the more valuable Bitcoin becomes the less likely it will be used for trading since holders of it will tend to hoard it and convert it to less desirable currency for day to day trading. 
Does that answer your question?

Yes, you're correct. I wanted to see what he would say though. He says,


Well, John, where does the FED get the money it uses to buy government debt and other assets? To say it "prints" it is a simple way to say it *creates* it. The FED has no money, per se. It buys debts and securities by simply increasing the balance in the seller's reserve account. That's precisely how it works. Commerical banks create the majority of the money supply using the fractional reserve process but the FED (whose 12 regional banks are private corporations) does, in fact, "print" money.

The principal is *vanished* into the ether, while the interest and fees are considered FED income. In theory the FED keeps only 6% of that then rebates the rest to the Treasury. Meaning the FED makes that 6% merely by virtue of having the perogative to create money.

They loan 90% of the deposit. Then that 90% is deposited and they loan 90% of that. Then that 90% is deposited and they loan 90% of that. And on and on and on. And all this assumes that the 10% reserve ratio is still strictly enforced, which it's not. With all the banking reform the reserve ratio has probably dropped to close to zero. 
If you cycle a $10 deposit down to 2 cents you get just shy of $100 created on a $10 deposit at a 10% reserve ratio.
