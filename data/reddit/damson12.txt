1. a highschool education prepared you much better for the workforce in the 40s (when manufacturing jobs were aplenty). there was also far less demand for specialized workers. 
2. a highschool education does not prepare you for jack shit now, the most in demand jobs are in technology and STEM fields, highly specialized fields. 
3. college being expensive is really just a problem here in the states. is it sustainable? no. does that mean college will become far less common? not one bit. 
this really has nothing to do with fiat money, idk what this sub's fascination is with blaming monetary policy on everything when most people (yourself included) clearly haven't spent 5 minutes thinking about why the world works the way it currently does.

Fallen prey to what? Not spending money on something I don’t understand?

You have convinced yourself of this reality which is really just not true. 
For one thing, most people like going to college. It’s a formative social experience and gives students tools to learn about the world. 
Going to college objectively opens up a huge amount of employment options. As another poster added, unemployment rates are far lower for college graduates.

No. My thinking (government is better than no government) is pretty common

yikes... 
I'm "lashing out" bc I'm it's quite irritating to discuss this with someone who is ideologically living in an alternate universe. Your perception of society/government is so far removed from my own (and most educated people's) that I have neither the interest or energy to discuss it with you. I doubt we would get much done anyway. 
Merry Christmas though. :)

I don't find your condescending attitude *helpful*, but I'm inclined to agree about bitcoin pricing. Why should Bitcoin be worth 10k rather than 1k? Why is 1k more reasonable (to people on this sub) rather than 100 dollars? Can anyone give me a good reason?
