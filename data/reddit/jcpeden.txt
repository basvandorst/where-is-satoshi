I'll run that past him. He was saying he was having major issues as he had no proof of address. None of his bills are sent to his apartment.

Without a bank account your going to pay over the odds for your BTC but you could setup a wallet and then buy with cash using Local Bitcoins for example.

Thanks, but this option still seems pretty admin heavy.
@_date: 2017-02-12 09:38:37
Righto - I'll continue to do that then :)
@_date: 2017-02-12 01:32:16
Thanks, will check them out.

It's over nine-thousaanaaaaaaand!!!

Standing by!

Has anyone seen pushy asian Dad? The 'when $10,000' meme needs updated.
@_date: 2017-09-08 23:12:57
Too much information here man. I end up watching the ticker all day!
@_date: 2017-09-10 10:31:18
Yep! Must. Stop. Checking. Prices!
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:52:24
Thought that might be the case. Best just to dollar cost average with a chunk each week rather than timing these dips?
@_date: 2017-09-10 11:27:49
Haha. I just realised I had some BCH in my Trezor this morning after the 1 August fork.
It's now all BTC.
@_date: 2017-09-06 20:56:25
Backed the right horses!

Where in the UK do you live mate? A lot of my family are Northern Irish farmers (plenty of wind power up in north antrim) but none of them grow anything.
Interested in knowing more about your project.
@_date: 2017-09-10 18:25:44
Used it today to sell my BCH. Don't see the issue personally.

What were the major driving forces for massive rally to ATH? Are we likely to see them again, do you think?

Thanks for making me feel better!

My personal experience with LBTC has been different and considering how risky/shady the process could be I think it's actually pretty good.
What happened to you?
@_date: 2017-09-24 03:19:08
Don’t even really care whether you like or dislike Corbyn.
Great sign though!
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:20:29
Do you know of any good case studies on startup costs?

Yeah, I can get on board with this!

I would have to be able to create 1 job for every £30K in profit generated. That seems pretty reasonable, even if it's just a security guard for the facility.

So many memes!

I've used Local Bitcoins, Bittylicious, Cryptosaurus and Coinbase for transactions ranging from £100-£3000.
They've al been fine but I've only used Coinbase for smaller transactions due to their card fees and only accepting SEPA payments in Euros.
@_date: 2017-09-10 16:37:44
I didn't in the past, but I do now!
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:13:42
No, what is that?
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:52:10
Agreed. Absolutely frightening.
@_date: 2017-09-06 12:31:36
This actually made me laugh. Good work!

Already have an account with them myself but I've never used them.

This is an old post from 2015 that you can find [here](
However, even with today's market cap of around $94bn, Bitcoin is still in the same realm of a very wealthy individual. Muammar Gaddifi was at one time estimated to be worth $200bn and Vladimir Putin is currently estimated to be worth about the same.
When you compare Bitcoin (even at it's current market cap, 20x larger than shown in this infographic) to almost any other chunk of money in existence there's still a lot of room to grow, in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-09-06 12:31:59
I've not come across that. How much do you think I could lose by handing my BTC over to them?
@_date: 2017-09-10 11:12:00
I understand. I've been afraid of that happening but it hasn't been an issue so far.
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:32:30
This is most definitely!
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:14:11
Nope. Setting up a node because I think Bitcoin is ace and I want to support the network.
@_date: 2017-10-17 08:34:28
I think someone might be spending a bit too much time on ;)
