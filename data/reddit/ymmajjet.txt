Sometimes exchanges lose your bitcoins. Either maliciously by stealing them and disappearing or sometimes through hacks targeted at them. So it is always safer to have the bitcoin on your own wallet which you can control

Hope this works out good for all of us

Deal extreme. They have so much shit which I could buy. 
But my debit card doesn't work with PayPal because of additional layer of security as mandated by our government.

Hi everybody! 
How do I go about buying bitcoins outside the US? I have an account on blockchain but its empty:( 
Also how effective is mining? I get free power in my college dorms so its not an issue. Does it require 24/7 net access?

I was finally able to buy some Bitcoins in india! They are worth INR 5000, which is significant for me considering my student budget.
I used a service similar to Coinbase called buysellbitco.in My bank details were verified and I was able to buy from them.
I had first considered buying when the price was about $290 but couldn't because of many reasons.
I would have bought them from Localbitcoins, but there were no Cash deals in my City.

While its getting some coverage, mostly people are taking it negatively for bitcoins  with the "Ha! I told you." attitude. 
However this is largely because of the lack of proper knowledge of bitcoins.

Tipping is really awesome. And when the not comes over and verifies, it gets the beginners to look more into it. This is how I was drawn here. Somebody tipped someone and I followed the bot to get here. Even though I haven't been lucky enough till now.

Some problems which I faced while buying: 
No exchange for standardised rates. 
Localbitcoins charging high premium. 
Very few sellers who charge very high rates. 
No marketplace for buying any goods.

Is it that easy to fish for some tips? I posted a thread in the beginners subreddit and I got a few replies with proper details. :(

Good for you man! Since you said you dont believe in material goods, why not spend money on some charitable institutions and giving back to your community. You could deposit some amount in a bank account and the interest could be used to pay for various charities of your choice. 
You could also invest in education. Higher education right now is commercialised to such an extent that it is no longer affordable for a common. 
Don't fall for greed. Cashout some amount which you are comfortable with. Nobody knows how high or low the value would goto.

I meant to ask why are people sending money to FBI wallet? How will they benefit from it? Some people have sent uphill 20-30 btc
@_date: 2013-11-15 13:59:20
Thank you very much kind sir/maam!

AFAIK, there is no practical use in India. There are a few early adopters who have made big money and the rest of the people are mostly younger people looking for a non traditional investment medium. 
The transaction fees could be a problem when it is widely adopted. 
For reference, a nice cup of coffee in one of the few Starbucks would cost about $3. A fee of 0.005 would mean addition of about 10% to the cost of coffee
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:41:45
I saw the public notes associated with the transactions and thought they were added by people sending money. 
Sorry for the noon mistake :O

And if they start selling if, the market will crash to unknown depths
@_date: 2013-12-27 05:50:06
Well I don't have much. Less than a hundred dollars. And I was talking about the legal implications. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 08:11:49
I really want to get some BTC but im held back due to the difficulty to buy in my country. Localbitcoins is an option but its difficult to trust random sellers. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:09:41
Thanks a lot!! I would definitely follow your advice!!
@_date: 2013-10-31 19:16:12
You could try making a new post asking for suggestions. A crowdthought advertisement!! Anyways you are doing an awesome job! This would definitely help newbs like me to get to this sub.

Why are people sending money to that address? What will they get from doing so?

Here's the donate link if anybody's having trouble finding it 
@_date: 2013-12-27 05:32:36
Any idea what happens to people who bought from them? I was one :(
@_date: 2013-11-12 09:30:05
India. Cash exchanges are almost non existent. Everybody deals with bank transfer :(
