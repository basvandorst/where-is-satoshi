it’s not the only thing that has value but it does have value. currency, in all forms, is only a matter of faith in the idea that other people believe it has value as well. the important thing to remember about bitcoin and any limited, decentralized, secure cryptocurrency is there is no board of directors, there is no inflation, there is no government or private entity able to manipulate the market with inflation. learn more about the origins of fiat currencies and you might find there are bigger concerns to think about with those. land, real estate, and resources are tangible and real by nature, anything else is a figment of a collective belief. Bitcoin is as well, there are basic principles involved in its functionality that lend well to an ability to believe in its value. and with every other investment option, if you don’t think it will increase in perceived value, don’t invest in it.

David Icke is a legend, I just wish he’d speak higher of decentralized crypto, it’s the antidote to the “they”

A bubble is an event or condition in a market, ie: housing bubble, tech bubble etc. it’s not the definition of a market, predicting a crash is as good as predicting a run

filing legal documents, government records, signing of contracts, leases, wills, creative works registration, patents... blockchain is a method of verification and anyone can create one. there is no “the blockchain” there are as many as needed/wanted

all of the things i listed would benefit from an objective form of record verification that can be done using blockchain technology

it’s backed by a fundamental scarcity and offers the inverse of inflation at least. At best it will become a global standard store-of-value. Long term holding is an easy strategy as it’s volatility in these beginning stages make day trading extremely risky

the best part about cryptocurrency is that laws are powerless against it

hardwallet, impossible for them to access. don’t store anything on exchanges unless you are actively exchanging it, once you send from exchange to a hardwallet address there is no way to prove possession of the hardwallet address.
