Cant he do the same by forcing you to say the words? Also you would likely be using a bitcoin card to do stuff, for the sake of convenience. How else would you retain the convenience of purchasing?

How do we prevent individual exchanges or coinbase/blockchain from becoming defacto banks since you have to store your bitcoin somewhere.

Doesnt the same go for credit cards? You only need to remember 4 digits and you are set, just like you described.

Lets hope people catch on to that. There's a long way to go still, as some people havent even caught upon credit cards yet. But who knows how the future will unravel :)

The thing you said about coinbase becoming a de facto bank is what worries me. How do you prevent any exchange from stealing your data and btc? You get your private key fron them right? What keeps them from accessing it?

But if it get stolen you still need the PIN code, and also you can disable it using your bank. 
Im not sure how do you mean it doesnt let you use other currencies? It automatically transfers the money from one currency to another by acting as an exchange using the bank's rates.

I see a lot of people do that. And one thing falls on my mind, and it kinda undermines the purpose of a bitcoin as a currency. We all are going to sell btc at some point, and guess what we arw getting in return: dollars. So in the end regular fiat currency wins as bitcoin cant replace it fully.

My question is how can they get paid so much? I mean the sheer amount of people that get rich in that short of a period. Where do those dollars come from?

It was his downfall.
