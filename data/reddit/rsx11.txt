Right, I didn't notice you had small x in your base58 string at ...Ay4xBq...; mine was Ay4XBq.
I just re-downloaded the clue page and diffed it against what I got earlier, and there are two differences.  One is the extra space near the 'o' (which I assumed to be a typo then), and the other is the change from X to x at line 650:
     -647,7 +647,7 
                        |  dF qL  |   dF|
                        |  HhmdH  |   Hm|
                        |  H   H  [%]H   H |
    -                   |      X   |     |s
    +                   |      x   |     |s
                        |   F     |     |
                        | |        |    |
                        | |    FF   |    |

This paper seems to be just as much about fingerprinting as it is about generating random numbers on the same device.  With tens of thousands bits of SRAM, at the conservative estimate of entropy density of 1/32, there are at least 312 bits of entropy every time the device is powered up.  See also  .

Can you give more details about the last step, please?  I got stuck at 2hJZoD5CEfo1FhVr6FKvqtoEdFFGPP8Ay4XBqA2xsNUW, decoded it as 32-byte sequence, and as a private key it converted to addresses starting with 1EMY and 1AD3, none of which held the bitcoin.
If I follow your steps, I get the same addresses from brainwallet.  How exactly did you convert 2hJZ... to key?
Edit: should not have copy-pasted the base58 string from this thread just because it looked like the one I had!  Mine actually had a capital X inside instead of a small x.

And they can be switched to uncompressed in the settings.

It can do 12-word HD wallet seeds.  The words follow BIP-39, they are **not** compatible with Electrum.

It's pretty much the same with SRAM in this device.  Each bit has its own tendency towards 0 or 1.  A lot are almost always stuck at 0 or 1.  Some are in the middle and can equally likely be 0 or 1 on power-up.  Others have some preference for 0 or 1, e.g. they end up at 1 twice as often as at 0.
The skew of each bit is due to random manufacturing fluctuations, as explained above.  The closer it is to the middle, the more entropy this bit has.  In every device this pattern is different, and that's the basis for fingerprinting.
Fingerprinting itself is not important for Mycelium Entropy.  What's important is that on average 21 bits of SRAM produce 1 bit of entropy on every power-up.  With the amount of SRAM on the device that gives several thousand bits of entropy.
This raw entropy is quite sparse and spread throughout the entire SRAM.  So a cryptographic hash function extracts the entropy to make a 512 bit true random number, where each bit is fully random.  This is where keys and HD seeds are derived from.
When several wallets are generated by pressing the button, a PRNG algorithm is used similar to the child key derivation function in HD wallets.  Some hardware entropy from secondary (non-SRAM) sources is also added.
