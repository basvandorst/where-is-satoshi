Well, the great thing about Bitcoin is that its uses and functions work with or without ‘proper’ acceptance by the IRS or any other domestic or foreign agency.

Exchanging fiat for crypto or crypto for fiat is a taxable event. Exchanging one crypto for another crypto is a taxable event. Purchasing something with your crypto is a taxable event. Do some research to figure out what the tax implications are in your area; it varies widely by region/country.

The reason it keeps getting pushed back is because they have yet to get regulatory clearance to proceed. It won’t go live until they’re allowed to, which is why it makes no sense for them to continue to announce dates just to push it back for the nth time.

Wrong, although it’s a similar case. The academic that put out that original paper also did this one much more recently and the new one aimed to approve upon issues present in the original paper. From what I can tell, this second version is still riddled with misunderstandings of crypto and full of false assumptions.

What does this offer over other similar, more established platforms? Cryptowatch, Coinigy, Quadency, etc. offer far more exchanges and are significantly cheaper per month. Looked at the website and didn’t see anything that sets it apart.

He’s probably talking about how an API key with trade permissions enabled can be used by someone to use your funds and trade into themselves and make profit even if they can’t directly withdraw your funds. It’s essentially what happened with the Binance API hack awhile back, although that method isn’t common at all.
@_date: 2019-08-10 18:01:03
Exactly the point I’m making. Past returns don’t guarantee future performance. The amount of money it took flowing into bitcoin to get it from a $1B MC to a $200B MC is many, many, many orders of magnitude less than what it would take to get it from a $200B MC to a $20 trillion MC (@ $1M a coin).  
  
I’m all for bitcoin’s success, but expecting a $1M BTC any time even remotely soon is just being willfully ignorant.
@_date: 2019-08-14 19:31:48
I tend to agree with this sentiment, but my comment was based on SFOX's most recent [market volatility report]( It shows a -0.4 correlation between BTC and the S&amp;P so there definitely is inverse correlation present but again, isn't super strong. It just doesn't mean there's any causal link between the two.

Can’t speak on how accurate those numbers actually are. They very well may be real at the moment, but it won’t be nearly that high once those miners are actually released and people start mining with them. Those numbers are based on current mining conditions which would inevitably change once a supposedly extremely profitable ASIC hits the market.

Most if not all custody solutions utilize hardware wallets for their clients. Most institutions are also required to hold funds with a qualified third-party custody provider.

You paid much higher than the current market price because Coinbase is a broker, not an exchange. If you want to buy/sell with lower fees, your best bet is to move your funds to Coinbase Pro (which can be done right in the normal Coinbase site) and trade from there.

I’m assuming that you have no real background in investing. If that’s true, you should not be taking and managing other peoples’ money regardless of how sure of a bet you think it is. And as mentioned by others, there’s a solid chance you’re breaking the law in doing so anyways.

The assumption that this question relies on isn’t entirely true. While there exists an inverse correlation between the stock market and bitcoin, it’s not super strong. So you can’t just expect a down day in the stock market to mean bitcoin is up, or vice versa. But to answer your question, yeah, it most likely just went into cash.

Futures trading and margin trading are not the same thing, although they’re not mutually exclusive in a market either. Margin trading involves borrowing assets from a lender to trade more than you normally could. Futures involve an agreement to transact an asset on a specific date at a specific price and allows traders to bet on what they think the market will do. I don’t mean this to be insulting, but what’s your interest in buying Bakkt futures if you don’t really understand what futures are?  
  
Edit: You also have to be an institutional or accredited investor to even use their platform (for now).

Well of course, someone forcibly imposing their beliefs on others (which forced marriage, murder of non-believers, etc. are extreme examples of) should never be accepted — that we can agree on.

You will not find an exchange that has no spread. Spreads fluctuate continuously, and highly liquid markets will have the lowest ones most often (e.g. Coinbase Pro typically has a spread of a couple cents). If you’re in NYC, your best bet for an exchange besides Coinbase Pro is Gemini’s Active Trader platform.

These bullet points have literally nothing to do with the legitimate concerns that I pointed out.  All those things are fine but that doesn’t invalidate the other issues.
  


  
I'm not concern trolling. You guys make some very strong claims on your website and have done almost nothing to back any of them up. If you guys actually want to succeed, you can't act like criticism is just someone trolling and continue to provide no information. That just continues to make me think that all of this is incredibly fishy.  
  
Edit: LMFAO, and you guys are tweeting that for new depositors "We will double your BTC deposit in 12 months"? You guys are sketchy at best.

For anybody who doesn’t read the article, before the anti-Coinbase circlejerk starts, this says a lot more about Barclays than it does about Coinbase. This really just represents the continued apprehensiveness that major banks have about getting involved in crypto (or at least for providing banking services to companies in the space).
@_date: 2019-08-15 12:20:57
Had never heard of MoonTrade before, but there are some things that arise concern out of me when looking at your website.  
  
Why do you have your own 'stable' token MOOT? You already support multiple well-established dollar-pegged stablecoins, so I'm confused about why you felt you had to introduce your own. You guys provide no evidence about how the peg for MOOT is actually achieved, evidence that you actually have the reserves, or evidence of an actual banking relationship.  
  
The entire FAQ section for 'Is MOOT safer than BTC?' is laughable at best also:  
  


  
So your proprietary protocol allows you to pull money out of thin air and reimburse someone just because it wasn't their fault?  
  


  
The entire premise for this MOOT token completely defeats the purpose of why people think BTC is safe. MOOT is centralized and operates under the sole discretion of your exchange operators. MOOT on your exchange is very much analogous to dollars in a normal bank account, and your claims about it being safer than BTC completely disregard BTC's decentralized network and network security.   
  
MOOT is also an ERC20 token, so your centrally-controlled token is still affected by a blockchain network -- the very networks that your FAQ warns about being unsafe. It's also hilarious that even though it is an ERC20 token, you guys show little understanding of Ethereum by claiming: "MOOT token supply is capped at 100 million like Ethereum." Ethereum is inflationary and has an uncapped, forever-increasing supply.  
  
Just the fact that you are pushing this nonsense, among other things on your website, makes me inclined to never use this website.
@_date: 2019-08-10 17:39:38
It will be a long, long time. People seem to think that prior exponential moves up in price will continue to happen without considering that you will need exponentially more money coming in to get that same return. Even then, outstanding Bitcoin having an equal value to all gold is only ~$350,000 per coin. So like I said, it will be a very long time before we see a $1M dollar coin.

I don’t believe bitcoin is fungible, but Dovey Wan is the epitome of how sketchy the Chinese bitcoin market is. She constantly pushes rumors or just plain misinformation as fact. Her trying to push the idea here that coinbase BTC by default has some super high premium is further proof of that and is utter nonsense. Few people, if really anybody, outside of China would believe this to be true.
@_date: 2019-08-20 20:12:23
For sure. That + spreads represent the risk the ATM operator takes on to buy or sell in the open market once you make your transaction. Can definitely understand why the spreads are higher, but unless you need BTC right in the moment and don’t have another option, there are far better ways to get it.
@_date: 2019-08-15 00:15:35
Buy regardless of price, you’ll find it is often too challenging to time the dips. There are a number of services that let you set up recurring purchases, so my suggestion would be to have it purchase $25 worth of bitcoin weekly.

I mean, I get that it’s inconvenient and annoying that you can’t actually withdraw or deposit BTC to Robinhood. But as much as people like to think otherwise, examples like yours are proof that they are actually buying and selling real coins through exchanges and acting as the middleman — it wouldn’t be sustainable otherwise.   
  
If I had to guess, they have a number of institutional accounts set up across exchanges and liquidity services that facilitate user trades across markets. Robinhood is a broker middleman, and not executing any orders themselves. I just don’t get why people automatically assume they’re running a fraudulent practice just because they don’t have the best possible setup — what legitimate evidence is there that they’re fraudulent? Hell, I’m sure if you emailed them they’d give you more info about the process.

Not that bad of a spread *for a Bitcoin ATM. All Bitcoin ATMs have shit spreads.

Whatever data source you’re grabbing that from just has incorrect data. The y scale claims it’s volume *in BTC* yet peaks at around 176M, which is several times more than the total number of coins that will ever exist (i.e. it was never that high). The exchange ban also didn’t go into effect until a few months after that chart would indicate.
@_date: 2019-09-20 23:40:36
Not a great idea. Services that do this (Lolli, Fold) exist but having companies do it directly would lead to lower sales for them. The average consumer doesn’t care enough for Bitcoin if it means the item is a higher cost in dollar value. There isn't much incentive for the company in example either since that would just be them essentially selling you crypto which is a bigger mess than simply accepting BTC as payment or not integrating it at all.
@_date: 2019-09-03 20:57:28
This is a lot of nonsense, and a prime example of what’s wrong with the crypto community today. Bitcoin, or whatever other cryptocurrency you’re in, isn’t about making a quick buck. It’s about leaving the system that facilitates these bubbles to happen in the first place. What’s the point in buying a cryptocurrency to save yourself from turmoil in traditional markets when your endgame is to cash out back into the system that will inevitably fail again?
