Although when lending as a financial institute, if someone defaults on their loans, you can go after assets to recoup some loses while writing off the rest. If someone defaults in this scenario, you're 10miles down shit creek without a paddle.

And even banking troubles like this aren't exactly good arguments for a complete takeover. So what if I can't do online banking between 1 and 6? The people that need to adopt cryptos for them to work are going to be asleep during that time be ready for work in the morning

Have you seen this place? It's nothing more than a circlejerk nowadays

No? You're telling me bitcoin operated banks will work only on business days? But how is my bitcoin going to be superior to regular banking?

Eli5, if the USD were to suddenly crash, how would bitcoin retain its value? If it's traded in USD/Bitcoin, wouldn't the crash in USD proportionally affect bitcoin?

I don't see how it's fair to compare 1913-&gt;2016 when bitcoin has been around for about 7 years, ~3 years of popularity.

Bitcoin itself doesn't perform the same function as Western Union. The block chain and wallet software's perform the same role as Western Union. Bitcoin itself is essentially just USD. The service isn't based off money, it's based off the transfer of money.

Wait wait wait... you're telling me.. that most people in this subreddit are delusional and think that bitcoin is just going to replace a multi century long economic system overnight? You're crazy...

Perhaps the tracking program they use works on windows and doesn't work right on 99/100 distros?

Shhh. You're ruining the circlejerk

Quite a few large retailer has some form of charge card. Khols, Sears, target, even Amazon and newegg have their own form of financing.

1.) He's lying.  
  
2.) He's an idiot

Not one time in your "Big bank bad. Bitcoin good" rant did you ask for anybody else's opinion. You just complain about chase shutting your account down but being alright because "you purchased and transfered Bitcoin in two clicks" it just sounds like a fucking advertisement but you forgot to give out the exchange's name.

When you buy luxury cars, some insurance companies basically tell you how many miles you can drive a year to keep depreciation values down. The difference between a Ferrari with 6000 miles can be thousands more than the same model/features with 10,000 miles

Steam introduced Bitcoin integration quite a while ago. You haven't had to use a credit/debit card for a while.

Whoa whoa whoa. We don't need any of your "Logic" or "laws" in here. This is a place to circlejerk each other about how safe bitcoin is.

Take salomondrin on YouTube for example. He only buys cars that are good financial decisions. Albeit, most of them are over $100-200k, but he said he always tries to get nice cars that are an investment.

They are using like the 10 day window directly after brexit and comparing it to bitcoin as it skyrocketed at the same time. Standard circle jerk material.
