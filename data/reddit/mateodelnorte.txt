It may not be completely obvious from this post, but these cards are the solution to this problem. The cards can be used to create a multi-sig account, such that if you lose the card with the account on it you can just use a backup card and your Lattice to regain access. If you lose your Lattice, you can get a new one and use two your main card and backup card to regain access. This, plus cold storage, are the main purpose of the cards – giving every day people the safety and security you'd get with today's forms of money.

Can you cite an example of a product or service that is not food, housing, or healthcare related that you expect would increase in price due to inflation? These items would be exempted from VAT.
Other items, like your television, go down steadily in price or increase in quality over time with near constant price due to innovation and competition.
Not to mention that price fixing is punishable under antitrust law.

How many trees must one plant to offset the carbon produced for the electricity required to mine 21M bitcoins?

Yang is not a politician. He a businessman and founder of a nonprofit who's entered politics to make a difference. Do some research. Watch a video or two.

You're not using English correctly. What you're doing is called "conflating".
Just watch a video or two and give the guy a chance of convicting you there is at least one person who is not in this to be a power monger.

Last I read, the Bitcoin network uses the electricity of a small to medium sized city. Sure your statement isn't just wishful thinking?

Companies only claim VAT back if it was collected improperly and they actually are exempt. This is a positive aspect of the policy and shows it's harder for companies to game the taxation system.
Consumers do end up paying slightly higher prices for goods, but many of those goods are things like electronics and services who's prices go down over time due to innovation. To keep the short term effect of this from being regressive on the poor, you exempt staple goods like housing, food, education, sanitary goods, etc.
Stop thinking of it as free money. Think of it as a dividend from your country for being a participant in markets that generate enormous amounts of wealth. It also happens to just be cheaper to give out cash than to have means testing programs to check who should or shouldn't get (restricted) cash as do current welfare programs. 
Giving cash is the most efficient way of solving individuals' problems. They can choose to pay unforeseen medical expenses, buy food, retrain or reeducate themselves, save to buy a house, move for a new job. Millions of people know better what to do with money than a single government. The Freedom Dividend is distributed decision making for trickle up monetary policy.

You don't matter in regards to voting if you say votes don't matter. You took that personally and then called me a cunt.
Control yourself.

Can we get Andrew Yang into office, please, and start giving this cash to People so it can be put to immediate purchasing power use in the economy and multiplied through that continual use?

I think you're beyond jaded by blockchain culture.  I have zero concern Andrew Yang is lying. Lol.
I'm moving on to spread the word to people who matter.

You're really stretching it if you want to get binary and say a person who has just decided to run for office is the same as career politicians AND ALSO just like a political outsider who had a reputation as a charlatan in business. 
You're just arguing to argue at this point.

You're the cunt because of your negativist attitude. I'll be working with my voice and my vote to help those who help others and themselves. Nice accomplishment, speaking matter-of-factly. It didn't make you sound smarter, just like a dick.
