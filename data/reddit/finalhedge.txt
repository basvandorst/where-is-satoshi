Documentary, 60 minutes, Release: July 2015. 
Bitcoin: The End Of Money As We Know It traces the history of money from the bartering societies of the ancient world to the trading floors of Wall St. The documentary exposes the practices of central banks and the dubious financial actors who brought the world to its knees in the last crisis. It highlights the Government influence on the money creation process and how it causes inflation. Moreover, this film explains how most money we use today is created out of thin air by banks when they create debt. Epic in scope, this film examines the patterns of technological innovation and questions everything you thought you knew about money. Is Bitcoin an alternative to national currencies backed by debt? Will Bitcoin and cryptocurrency spark a revolution in how we use money peer to peer? Is it a gift to criminals? Or is it the next bubble waiting to burst?
If you trust in your money just as it is... this film has news for you.

Nasdaq adopts bitcoin backbone for stocks
Richard Waters in San Francisco
Nasdaq is to start using the technology behind the virtual currency bitcoin to handle transactions on its market, making it what is thought to be the first major financial market to adopt the idea.
The blockchain — the backbone on which bitcoin depends — has attracted wide interest in the financial world as a potentially revolutionary way to streamline many different types of transactions, though few alternative applications have yet been tried beyond bitcoin.
As a public, distributed ledger, the blockchain currently acts as a central repository for details of all bitcoin trades, though it could also be used for other financial assets. Transactions are validated based on a mathematical formula running on the computers of volunteers, removing the need for banks, clearing houses or other intermediaries.
“It brings a level of auditing that’s based on mathematics and not based on trusting a third party,” said David Johnson, chairman of Factom Foundation, a start-up trying to expand the use of the blockchain beyond bitcoin.
Nasdaq said it was looking to use the blockchain across its markets. The first application, due later this year, will handle the issuance and transfer of stocks on its Nasdaq Private Market platform, which was set up to handle trades in private company stocks.
The technology will “modernise, streamline and secure typically cumbersome administrative functions,” said Bob Greifeld, Nasdaq’s chief executive officer. Private companies in particular struggle with the requirements of keeping share registers manually, he added.
In a sign of the growing interest in the blockchain’s potential to disrupt how financial markets operate, Blythe Masters, the former JPMorgan executive who help develop the idea behind credit default swaps, earlier this year joined Digital Asset Holdings, a start-up focused on the area. At the time, she described the task of reducing the costs and inefficiencies in financial transactions as “one of the great challenges of our time.”
Besides ending the need for intermediaries like banks or clearing houses, the use of the blockchain could also make the completion of transactions almost instant, compared to the period of days most trades currently take to settle, Mr Johnson said.

Long-ass article posted below (in two parts) for people who don't want to sign up. TL;DR "I still really hate bitcoin"
21 Inc and the plan to kill the free internet
Izabella Kaminska	| May 19 15:10 | 5 comments
Part of the BITCOINMANIA SERIES
Details of the hottest, most secretive bitcoin start-up in Silicon Valley have finally been revealed by chairman and soon-to-be CEO Balaji Srinivasan of 21 Inc in a post on Medium. They are, by and large, exactly what FT Alphaville reported them to be. Cold sharp summary: Bitcoin mining devices in toasters.
Calling this a simple internet of things play, however, would be lazy. To really put the audacity of Srinivasan’s vision into perspective one first has to go back in time to the days of the early internet.
The first thing to understand is that the structure of today’s internet economy owes almost everything to a single bold assumption by the early web pioneers, namely that “information wants to be free!“.
Nowhere is this vision better set out than in the 1982 movie Tron, which tells the story of a bunch of anthropomorphised computer programmers going against the yoke of an oppressive Master Control Programme in “the grid”, a celluloid metaphor for the monopolistic tech corporations of the day.
What is less known about the film is that computer scientist and digital utopian Alan Kay — the founding father of object oriented computing — acted as its key technical consultant, rendering much of the narrative his personal call to digital nerds to rise up and be rid of the evil corporate overlords who constrain the dissemination of information, as much as a Disney-type fable.
And, in the real world, that’s pretty much how the web turned out. Information was set free; industries were Napsterised and the internet economy was transformed into a socialistic system in which data and information roamed free.
Except that, with time, it has become clear that things didn’t work out as intended. Instead of empowering the masses, the proliferation of free data has led to a Wild West free-for-all, where those who have a good understanding of how free information can be commandeered and exploited do exactly that.
Returning to the Tron analogy, destroying the Master Control Programme did not lead to the free society the web idealists envisioned. The old authoritarian powers were simply displaced by newly emergent authorities instead.
By the time the sequel to the Tron movie arrived in 2010, it’s clear the movie producers felt a need to communicate this change of heart as gracefully as possible. And so it was that the movie’s message turned from advocating free information to warning that systems which strive for too much perfection inevitably fail, and that ‘imperfection’ is desirable. In this recasting, the web’s most creative and vulnerable members needed protection if the web were to retain meaning and relevance in the real world.
As Kevin Flynn, chief protagonist and voice of the web pioneers, expresses ignominiously in the film: “I screwed it up, chasing after perfection.”
Back in the real world, decades worth of social conditioning about the merits of free information hasn’t been so easily overturned. Free digital content is pretty much taken for granted, even if there’s no such thing as “free.”
The tech sector has a problem publicly admitting this.
If the sequel to the web, as we know it, is a hierarchal and monetised system, the transition consequently needs to be achieved in the same way that capitalism defeated Soviet communism — namely, by providing a small flavour of what it feels like to be a profiteering capitalist to those who, under the old system, would not have been able to profiteer in the same way.
Which brings us back to the 21 Inc launch and a very obvious fact: Information is not free and Silicon Valley knows it
One of the reasons, we propose, the tech gods of Silicon Valley are so keen on forwarding Bitcoin as a concept is because it ultimately allows them to back-pedal on the original premise that information should be free.
In that regard, 21 Inc arguably plays a critical role in the new Silicon Valley vision for a “paid for” meritocracy on the internet.
When FT Alphaville first outlined 21 Inc’s business model, showing that it planned to ‘democratise’ Bitcoin mining by embedding ASIC mining chips into everyday connected devices like USB rechargers, we noted the economics didn’t seem to make any sense. For one thing, it didn’t seem conceivable that consumers could ever profit from the tiny fractions of bitcoins they were mining, especially after their energy costs were factored in. Secondly, it seemed much more likely the model would see consumers subsidising the energy costs of 21 Inc’s own mining pool.
But the clue to 21′s real intention comes in the second part of Srinivasan’s opening and explanatory paragraph:
After much hard work, we’ve created an embeddable mining chip which we call the BitShare that comes in a variety of form factors. The 21 BitShare can be embedded into an internet-connected device as a standalone chip or integrated into an existing chipset as a block of IP to generate a continuous stream of digital currency for use in a wide variety of applications. You can request a dev kit by signing up on our website to get started.
What this really is, in other words, is a plan to bring a digital metering system to the internet.
And on that note the two following paragraphs are critical to understanding the vision here:
Devices that can pay your channel partners. At the manufacturer’s discretion, the 21 BitShare chip can be configured to support a variety of different revenue shares for the mined bitcoin. For example, one could build an internet-connected device that shared some portion of mined bitcoin between the user, the retailer, the handset maker, and the carrier — thereby reducing costs and/or increasing margins throughout the entire supply chain. And because of the nature of mining as an embarrassingly parallel problem, embedded mining can scale up or down to fit within the power and thermal envelope of virtually any device.
Bitcoin-subsidized devices for the developing world. 21 was built by immigrants, and using our technology to get more people around the world online is important to us. We believe the most significant long-term application of bitcoin may be reducing the upfront cost of internet-connected devices to make them more accessible for the developing world. The success of the iPhone was in nontrivial part due to the carrier subsidy; with embedded bitcoin mining we can in theory extend that model to any internet-enabled device, turning a lump sum upfront cost into a potentially more manageable cost of power over time.
Suddenly, a few of the 21 Inc pitch deck slides, which are circulating online and dare to compare 21 Inc to Google and Facebook, begin to make more sense:
This isn’t about disrupting fiat money, central banks or the existing financial rentier system. It’s about making the internet much more like the financialised real world. Namely, by adding an energy and scarcity cost to digital transfers on the web so that information can’t be as easily exploited as it is today.
Up for grabs, notably, is the marketshare of Google, Facebook and Twitter and their ilk, due to their dependency on free consumer data to drive their advertising-based revenue.
As it stands today, nobody really has an idea of what their data is worth because there’s no mechanism by which processed or unprocessed data bundles can be valued.
Yet we know for a fact that personal data, especially when processed in aggregate form, does have a value in the open market. If it didn’t, Facebook and Google wouldn’t be the multi-billion dollar organisations that they are today.
But the data market trades much more like highly illiquid OTC commodities than anything akin to an open market exchange. Deals seem to be done bilaterally, on a bespoke and opaque basis. There is no “processed data”-value index. And there is no inspection agent akin to a Platts or an Argus agent setting out the frequency and value of the trades that are taking place.

Exposing the “If we call it a blockchain, perhaps it won’t be deemed a cartel?” tactic
Izabella Kaminska	| May 11 17:59 | Comment | Share
Part of the BITCOINMANIA SERIES
Why are the great and the good of the banking and financial services world suddenly extolling the virtues of blockchain, the technology that underpins the artificial scarcity of bitcoin?
Possibly because they’ve finally figured out that what the technology really facilitates is cartel management for groups that don’t trust each other but which still need to work together if they’re to protect the value and stability of the markets they serve.
Cartel enforcement, in that sense, appeals to all sorts of financial players from bankers and commodity producers to general asset creators.
Though, we’d argue, it’s particularly applicable to entities whose cost of supply almost nothing — namely, those entrusted to create financial assets out of thin air in prudent and controlled form (a.k.a banks) not least because of the overriding short-term incentive to abuse the “we won’t oversupply” trust for one’s own individual gain.
As an aside, one of the key reasons central banks came about is precisely because centuries of banking history taught governments that too many cooks in the money-creation kitchen spoils the broth no end, hence it does makes sense to allow a government-mandated cartel-mechanism to exist to apply an artificial cost of supply where there wouldn’t be otherwise. For further reading on that, see Goodhart.
But the same logic also applies to commodity producers. Note, as an example, comments last week from Glencore CEO Ivan Glasenberg about who really may be to blame for the 40 per cent plus fall in the company’s share price:
“Unfortunately, our competitors . . . have produced more supply than demand and commodity prices are down for that reason,” Mr Glasenberg told shareholders at the company’s annual meeting in a casino in Zug, the low-tax city near Zurich in Switzerland.
“It’s not our fault governor! It’s the wider system’s unconstrained supply rate.”
But suppose the rate of production could be algorithmically controlled to make it more difficult to mine commodities, money or financial assets as and when too many entities enter the system? And suppose, on top of that, such a mechanism was dubbed “technology” instead of a cartel system outright.
Would anti-trust authorities be inclined to look the other way then?
Keep that in mind as we return to the underlying fundamentals that really destabilised the financial system in 2008. Yes, there was unknown risk in the system due to overzealous issuance of subprime securities. Yes, Libor rates began to skyrocket because banks refused to backstop each vis-a-vis their collective liabilities to the central bank. And yes, banks began telling porky pies about the amount of liquidity they really needed in the system.
But at its heart, we’d argue, the system failed because the cartel mechanism that controls credit issuance — the central bank — misread the supply picture to such a degree that there was no way all former members could survive at the new controlled supply rate.
Remember, from the perspective of the central bank, the system should be kept just short enough of liquidity to ensure that demand for central bank-issued money is always high.
At the same time, however, the central bank knows it must provide the liquidity the system needs for stability to be maintained — something it’s usually more than happy to do as long as the act of dispersing liquidity doesn’t have price destabilising side-effects.
This, in reality, is what price stability is all about.
If and when the central bank’s currency begins to lose purchasing power, the central bank knows it must withhold liquidity until the cartel’s weakest and least scrupulous member is identified and weeded out, or — alternatively — fear of cartel collapse makes it too costly for banks to keep creating assets at the rate they had become accosted to.
Either way, the overall result is a contraction in the broad money supply, with complementary cartel-esque price stabilisation effects.
The eurodollar situation
The central bank system described above, however, is only as good as the closed nature of the system it operates and the collective interest of the cartel members it supervises to operate within that closed system.
But herein lies the significance of the shadow banking sector. Shadow banking, by and large, is the means by which a closed controlled system is turned into an open and uncontrolled system.
This is best illustrated by the rise of the so-called “euro” dollar, pound and euro markets which exist in a hitherto unregulated and parallel capacity to those of the central-bank controlled onshore equivalents.
This is a problem because once dollars, euros or pounds leak beyond the supervisory scope of the core cartel enforcement agent, and begin to be intermediated, re-lent and cleared by less stringent cartel organisations on the sidelines, the stability of the domestic controlled system — including the implied value of the unit of account — become threatened.
The systems, effectively, end up facing their own version of the Ivan Glassenberg problem. So don’t blame the Fed, in other words, because those who clear dollar lookalike securities outside of the Fed’s control can’t be trusted to do the job reliably.
Since the crisis, it has as a result become de rigueur to clear all dollar-denominated transactions through New York. But this has exposed the world to the reality that every dollar denominated transaction is de facto subject to US foreign policy or government intervention. As Dan Davies notes with respect to the business of banks like Deutsche Bank, that does not play well with those entities that want to supervise dollar assets without having US policy enforced on them extraterritorially.
But as Davies notes, for a dollar clearing arrangement outside the USA to retain trust and operate without the need of a US central bank guarantee, it would need an extremely disciplined cartel mechanism to self-control supply (mainly because going cap in hand to the Fed for missing liquidity is unlikely to be an option again).
Small surprise then that many banks think the shared ledger “technology” of blockchain could be such an opportunity for the clearing of the eurodollar markets.
Small surprise, also, that central banks are investigating if the “technology” could provide a better and cheaper means for policing the existing bank system — which still doesn’t fully trust each other — than defaulting to a fully centralised full-reserve system like that being proposed in Iceland.

Part 2:
The market economy as a consequence has no way of factoring these costs into the bigger economic picture or of judging how these costs affect macroeconomic conditions in the real world.
What’s more, even if there was an inspection agent, it would be hard to make sense of such prices without the presence of some sort of universal data benchmark.
Anyone who hangs around the Bitcoin faithful long enough will encounter the assertion that bitcoin is superior to fiat currency because it is “backed by maths” — which, of course, is utterly meaningless. It would be much better to say that bitcoin is backed by the sum of human knowledge about maths.
Or alternatively, and much more accurately, that it’s backed by a stock of pre-processed data.
While it’s true that the processed data in question is light on both information (due to so much of it being pseudonymous in nature), there’s no denying the energy it took to create it.
It’s this base energy cost that can now be used as a public benchmark to price more information-intensive data against.
This makes us think the key objective of the high-order bitcoin enthusiasts (as opposed to the financial speculators) is mostly about giving consumers a choice. On the one hand to pay for specially designed web services with spent processing time (and energy) that helps support the public digital commons (which acts as a glue that links up all sorts of different datasets). Or, on the other hand, to pay for open web services directly with personal data on a trust basis.
Either way, once a transparent price is established for the former, it stands to reason a price for the latter can also be equally derived, opening the door to a meritocratic paid-for internet and a market where all personal data has a clear market price.
This, in any case, seems to be the vision Srinivasan is outlining for both 21 Inc and the web when he speaks of “reducing costs and/or increasing margins throughout the entire supply chain”.
The question is, to what degree will factoring in a price for something that was previously free upset the economic balance? And will the average user — especially the one who opts to subscribe to rental contracts for device access — understand the value of their own worth any better in this new paradigm than in the last one?

ItBit, a bitcoin exchange operating in New York and Singapore, has been approved as New York State Trust company and added a number of heavy hitters to its board of directors on the heels of a $25 million round from new and existing investors.
“The trust allows itBit to be a custodian for its client’s funds, which is a much higher duty of care than any other bitcoin company is regulated under right now,” said itBit chief executive and co-founder Charles Cascarilla. “It took us 15 months and a well over a thousand page application. It is extremely in-depth, extremely time-consuming and not easy to do.”
The issue of proper approvals from regulatory agencies is becoming more important on the heels of the news that the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (an arm of the US Treasury) fined Ripple Labs $700,000 for acting as a money services business without filing the proper paperwork.
Though the fine may be restricted to Ripple, itBit says it’s not taking any chances. “The whole financial system is risk-averse after 2007 and 2008,” said Cascarilla. “It’s not good enough to get a bank to deal with you as a counterparty.”
Currently, itBit is the only US-chartered and supervised bitcoin exchange that’s compliant with both New York and federal law.
The pains that itBit has taken to jump through regulatory hurdles have won it the support of heavy hitters like former Senator Bill Bradley, former FDIC chair Sheila Bair, and former chair of the financial accounting services board, Robert Herz.
Earlier this year, the company closed a Series A round of $25 million from investors including RRE Ventures, Liberty City Ventures, and individual investor Jay W. Jordan II, who invested alongside previous investors Raptor Capital Management chair James Pallotta.
“Bitcoin has the potential to transform the world of finance as we know it today,” said itBit board member Bill Bradley in a statement. “itBit can truly become the backbone of the entire Bitcoin ecosystem and help elevate its importance in finance, commerce and building new economies.”

"The Stanford marshmallow experiment was a series of studies on delayed gratification in the late 1960s and early 1970s led by psychologist Walter Mischel, then a professor at Stanford University. In these studies, a child was offered a choice between one small reward provided immediately or two small rewards (i.e., a larger later reward) if they waited for a short period, approximately 15 minutes, during which the tester left the room and then returned. (The reward was sometimes a marshmallow, but often a cookie or a pretzel.) In follow-up studies, the researchers found that children who were able to wait longer for the preferred rewards tended to have better life outcomes, as measured by SAT scores, educational attainment, body mass index (BMI), and other life measures."

Full thread:
•There is a modern obsession with the Medium of Exchange role of money, which is why Bitcoin is so widely misunderstood. Medium of Exchange is the least important role.
•Many people say Bitcoin cannot be successful because its volatility prevents it being a Medium of Exchange, hence concluding it's lousy money.
•However, this puts the cart before the horse. Money evolves in stages:
1) Collectible
2) Store of Value
3) Medium of Exchange
4) Unit of Account
Bitcoin is still between 1) and 2)
•Only when widely held will price volatility drop to gold-like levels. Then opportunity cost of selling will drop to levels suitable for use as a Medium of Exchange.
•Few people understand this because no one alive had seen a good being monetized in real-time as is happening to Bitcoin today.

Paul Sztorc raises this question as well and [suggests that prediction markets]( are the most viable remedy.
From where I stand it really boils down to being more of a philosophical question than a quantitative question. Which is to say that in the absence of these metrics we should err on the side of caution. I see Bitcoin's value as primarily derived from its stability, and even if segwit did not activate and with a 1mb blocksize it is still the gold standard as a cryptographic store of value.
