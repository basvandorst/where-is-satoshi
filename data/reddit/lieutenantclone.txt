The blockchain is irrefutable proof, no?  I guess just make sure the seller writes their bitcoin address on the receipt, so you can prove you sent the required payment to the correct address.

No matter how fast you pay off a credit card, it doesn't change the fact that it is credit.  And no, it is not a proxy for a bank account at all.  But really, the whole credit card comparison doesn't make any sense, so I am not going to continue discussing it.
Anyway... bitcoins are not reliable at all, as seen by the huge surge to $250 they took, followed by promptly crashing down to $150.  I would not call that reliable.  If a consumer bought your product at fair market value while BTC was $250, then it crashes down to $150, you just lost all your profits, and actually went into the negative on the transaction.  That is not reliable.  Reliable currency does not suddenly halve in value in the span of a couple hours.

No, credit cards are credit, not dollars.  Every time you use a credit card, you are literally spending someone else's money.  Bit coins are not credit, nor debt, they are plain currency, and for them to be popular they need to be as easy to use, and as reliable as other forms of plain currency like dollars.

Yes, you nailed it in that last sentence.  Arguing semantics and metaphors is what redditors do best.

Actually, if you are frequently buying and gifting games to other people in rapid succession, Steam is likely to lock your account.

No, they pay 5-10 people per day to stock shelves.  They pay one person a day at most to relabel price changes.  At minimum wage.

Sure, but I don't think that is a sustainable solution.  If bitcoins want to actually gain a foothold in the retail space, they need to be stable enough that retailers can accept and handle bitcoins on their own.  Otherwise, bitcoins are just an elaborate mask for dollars that make the transaction more complicated.

Yes, instead you pay $20,000-50,000 for initial hardware, $2,000 a year for replacement hardware or upgrades, and $50,000 a year for a part time technician to maintain them.  Even if those screens cost $1 in parts, you know they will be $40 each when sold to a retailer, I've seen what basic things like shelves or carts cost, and its absurd.  And technicians that work on that sort of stuff also make absurd rates and if they are outsourced the company that manages them takes an extra cut.
If a store has 1000 items at $40 per electronic label, that's $40,000.  Not unrealistic for a grocery store.  Then they need spare parts, and all the backend stuff like the server that controls them, wiring which has an installation cost, etc, etc.  Shit is not cheap.  Having a high school student put stickers on a shelf is actually incredibly cheap.

Xanny was talking about putting an LED microcomputer as the price tag infront of each product on a self, not an instapay system.

WTF, that's awful!
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:33:55
No, instead you have to pay someone much more than minimum wage to maintain your network of microcomputers.  That honestly does not sound viable at all.

There are too many people who are buying bitcoins just to sit on them, expecting that the price will keep rising.  I partially blame this on the lack of places to spend bitcoins, but right now most people just see them as an investment.

Great read, thanks for sharing your thoughts!

Hah, I have not heard that one yet, I will have to remember it.
