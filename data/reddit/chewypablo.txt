Good point on point a. Now point b won't work in Cuba. The only public places that offer internet in Cuba are hotels in Havana that charge $20 an hour which a Cuban can't afford or go to one of the few Internet cafes in Havana that cost $10/hour.
Edit: to elaborate on point A. In theory it is a good point, but like I had said previously, people can't even afford to learn what bitcoin is. I think if even the government found out, BAN! The Cuban government likes to have control (although quickly changing after pressure from the general population and the US) It would be interesting to meet someone in Cuba that actually understands what it is and owns some, I would totally send them .3 bitcoins.

If you don't have 3 friends to send them to, can you send me one? Tried rhapsody and Pandora one and can't find the one for me.

I was saying I would tip $50. Anything more than that, it better be good.

Who's going to steal his money? Bitpay?

But what is the benefit of getting the average consumer to use bitcoin? Isn't that the goal?
@_date: 2014-03-17 01:32:57
Talk to Tim from buyvcc.com and ask him for a VPS. He accepts bitcoin.

They actually have a fiber optic cable that runs from Venezuela that can easily start giving internet to major cities like Havana within months. The Cuban government isn't ready to have control over that internet and once they start the project, everything will be robbed, sadly.

I'm getting close to .5 bitcoins and I'm 15. Plan to have at least 5 BTC by the end of the year.

I'm currently using bitpay and stripe. Stripe will be adding bitcoin support soon so I would wait for that.

Kind of a late response, but I'm glad to see you're working on it!

They are making sure they meet all regulations in the US so are going state by state. 
@_date: 2014-05-14 15:45:28
There's also a limit on how big the tip can be. Kind of stupid as it doesn't show how powerful bitcoin can be. 
I personally don't like the new tipbot and would prefer the other one.

Banks also do follow this regulation. They have your SSN, they don't need your other information - they already know you are who you say. Bitcoin ATM's don't and they have to make sure you are who you are to follow the same regulations.

He can pay me directly to my bitcoin address. The problem is him acquiring the bitcoins. As far as I know, Bitpay doesn't accept fiat. Getting my supplier to accept it will be pretty easy as he can cash out through coinbase since he is US based.

If bitcoin reaches $10000/btc you shouldn't have a reason to pull out.

Yeah, probably $50. I'm certainly not rich or not even well off, but there is still tons of people who have less than me. It's always good to pay it forward.

Thank you!

Yeah, that's possible and we will save of fee's. We plan on doing that, but as of now, we have to use PayPal.

I know people that frequent Cuba and I don't think you understand that bitcoin doesn't even work in Cuba.
The average person in Cuba makes around $20USD/month. That isn't a lot of money and rent costs more than that. 
Internet is near non-existent in Cuba. It is improving with mobile carriers finally adding RESTRICTED internet access at $10/GB (remember, people make $20 a month)
Cubans don't have the option to call the local cable company and get internet because cable doesn't even exist. The only way that you can get internet in Cuba is be a foreigner and get DSL for $90 a month or get lucky and find a past foreigner that gives you there account and you just keep paying every month. You also have a low bandwidth limit that comes out to 1 hour/day. That majority of people in Cuba can't even afford internet. So saying that they can't afford multibit fee's is
Illogical because Cubans can't even afford to know what bitcoin is. It's sadly the truth because bit coin could prosper there, but until they have internet that a majority of the people can afford - bitcoin will not work in Cuba.
I know it's not what you are getting at OP. You are trying to make a claim, but it just isn't a good one. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 04:38:26
Exchanges sometimes are not the simplest and can take time for transfers. I would like to see coinbase or similar companies go to other countries. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 15:49:35
The problem isn't the company or the ATM. The problem is the regulations in place. If you can set up a ATM that doesn't require a palm scan and such, expect to be fined massive amounts for money laundering.

I think the limit is $15. I don't tip, but if I ever like a comment so much as to tip, I'll tip more than $15. That shows the power of bitcoin.

**This is a scam**
Look at the account age of the person who posted and his/her previous history. All the positive comments of this business are people who JUST made accounts. They will take your BTC and won't ship you shit. If you want to buy weed with your BTC there are plenty of other places to do it.
@_date: 2014-07-13 23:35:57
Bitpay wouldn't steal money. They've spent millions to make a great business and wouldn't tarnish their image and maybe even risk going to jail for it. They are based in the US. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 06:48:32
As someone who has studied fraud prevention after losing a few grand to it, you really don't want people to know the factors you take into consideration because scammers will find a work around.

I use Stripe and absolutely love it! The problem is someone can send me money to stripe without a card. People get paid with PayPal and they pay with PayPal, that's the problem.

This is a business partner who is in another country. The "escrow" part doesn't mean anything. Also, since it is a service, PayPal won't do shit.
