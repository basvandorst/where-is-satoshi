He's calling bullshit because bitcoin didn't exist when you are claiming this guy was making purchases.
@_date: 2015-06-27 10:25:33
I don't think it's fair to say he hates the idea that Africans should have privacy, I think he hates the idea that anyone would.

You suggesting mining is more ridiculous than whatever agenda the guy you're replying to has.

That maybe how it plays out, but that is definitely NOT what most of the people bringing up Greece and Bitcoin are meaning it.

@_date: 2016-03-20 05:29:13
No, you are spamming the same message over and over to anyone remotely interested in purchasing bitcoin.  Your suggestion is worthless for this scenario and you are nothing more than a shill.

You're accusing me of arguing three points while obviously confusing me with the others you are attempting to debate in the thread.  If you were actually trying to gain information on Bitcoin and Taxes, as you claim, you wouldn't have such a confrontational tone right off the bat and accusing people of representing positions they never took.

Your suggestion is for him to buy 1 bitcoin a day for a little over a year?  Probably the dumbest thing I have seen in this thread.
@_date: 2016-03-19 11:07:29
You didn't answer the question though.  Did they know it was a crime?
@_date: 2016-03-19 18:24:10
OP knows them personally.  It's a valid question.
@_date: 2016-03-29 02:24:15
You really aren't making much sense.  The individual I responded to questioned how the IRS would know who owned the wallet (that they were paying someone bitcoin for a service provided).  If you were trying to claim that you shouldn't be taxed for that transfer of Bitcoin, you couldn't tell the IRS to "prove who owned the wallet."  The IRS would hit you with the highest tax  liability possible on the transfer and then tell you to prove your claim (that it was just a transfer of bitcoin between wallets you and and thus not a taxable transaction).  I am merely informing the individual if it gets to the point where ownership of the wallet is concerned, the burden of proof is on you, not the IRS.  
I'm also not sure where the fuck you figured I was arguing 3 points because I have only ever said one thing, and that is the burden of proof is on you once the IRS gets involved.  Everything else seems to be made up BS in whatever fantasy thread you're participating in.
@_date: 2016-03-29 00:36:37
It isn't, I'm just saying if you're at the point where the IRS knows you dealt in bitcoins and are asking you to prove said transfers, you don't have the luxury of stating the IRS can't prove who owned the wallet and therefore they don't owe anything.  If it gets to the point where the IRS is questioning your bitcoin transfers, it's on you to prove your side cuz the default judgement will be a $0 cost basis sale that you will owe full taxes on.

It's easy to cherry pick a sentence out of an entire paragraph and then act like your point has been proven.  Why don't you try reading the post you are cherry picking from so you can understand what's being said before you continue to make an ass out of yourself?
@_date: 2016-03-28 22:17:40
They don't have to know who owns the wallet, the burden of proof is always on you.  They will treat the transfer as a sale and it is on you to prove otherwise.

Yes, and the SD card business is even worse.  They sell you 1 GB SD cards as if they are 32/64 GB, your computer even shows it has 32 or 64 GB.  Since Windows thinks it has more space than it does, when it hits the true 1 GB capacity, it starts overwriting from the beginning corrupting any data that was overwritten.

Sure it makes them money.  All the stuff you're doing with your online banking is stuff they used to pay tellers to do.  You are literally paying to do your own banking.

Rofl, this site has treated its customers like shit.  This is why I stopped using them.  The support was rude at best and completely incompetent.  They straight up lost a 2.5 bitcoin transaction "due to a system malfunction" and refused to refund to me because "it was a blockchain problem, not something they did."  That was the straw that broke the camels back for me.  So I will continue to call them scammers and their customer service reps rival those at Comcast.
@_date: 2015-07-31 08:52:07
There's no blockchain with fake dollars or euros.  Without the blockchain, bitcoin is worthless.  If there were fake bitcoins, that means the blockchain failed, which means bitcoin fails.

Sounds like you're projecting a bit doesn't it?  Seems too coincidental that you knew what bitcoin was, had used itbit and then magically had your account "hacked" and a large amount of bitcoin purchased.  Sounds like something a half baked scammer would do, with no experience and no foresight to anticipate explaining how prior account history doesn't mean you didn't do. 
How about you go ahead and ask the bank to send you the evidence they used to determine authorized use.  I bet it's because of consistant IP's used to both initiate wire transfer and access the itbit site and the IP you regularly use to access your BoA account information.  Maybe next time you won't choose to drop 20k on some stupid scam attempt without thinking things through a bit more.  Get fucked.
@_date: 2016-02-02 00:05:33
Because we've seen it time and time again.  99% of the "I got scammed" sob stories where their computer was "hacked" and someone bought a ton of bitcoin using their information end up being some half-baked scam attempt by some peon who thinks scamming is easy.
Edit:  After reading the first two pages of your account history, you are attempting to solicit financing for a new "venture" and you also lost money on some margin trading.  Definitely redflags.
@_date: 2015-07-01 21:47:24
Yes it is.
@_date: 2016-02-02 09:05:13
No just you.
@_date: 2016-02-02 00:07:38
You were denied because the IP used to purchase the bitcoin is the same IP used to previously buy from itbit and also matches the IP used to previously access your BoA account.  Even if your claim of being keylogged is true, they would be using your IP to commit the fraud.  It's a very obvious sign that you were attempting to scam and I am personally glad you didn't get away with it.

We aren't there yet though, the guy does have a valid opinion.  It's bad for the long run, but as of right now, the transaction fees aren't whats keeping this going.  Now, if he then complains that it takes 48 hours to get a confirmation because he's too cheap to add a .0012 cent transaction fee, then I would think it's fair to ridicule.

You must not pay attention lately because there has been some really good news for bitcoin the last 72 hours.  And it doesn't seem like you have any idea what a pump is since good news is usually what pumps ares based off of.  
@_date: 2015-10-30 14:00:33
You are misunderstanding.  They are claiming the bank will only process deposits after all debits to the account have gone through to allow the bank to charge more fees.  They must process deposits first and then the debits, but they are free to reorder the debits to maximize fees.

This doesn't happen in the US (and if it's not happening there I doubt it's happening in more civilized parts of the world).  It used to, but they must put deposits in and then post payments now.

Reordering of transactions does happen, but the person I replied to said that they process deposits after processing the debits and that is just simply not the case anymore.  I've had the exact scenario he described but that was in the early 2000's.  Banks can't get away with that anymore.
