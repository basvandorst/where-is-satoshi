Also, falling for the "You need to send money first in order to receive more money later"? This is like Nigerian Scam 101.

**Me:** "I want to withdraw €5000."
**Bank:** "You don't have an account with us."
**Me:** "Well, I think that guy outside is right, then!"

The school can know who you are, you posted your paper.
I call this bullshit.
If you’re not fake, take this as a compliment, since you’re way more mature for your age.

I hope you used a empty wallet for the QR code in this picture.

When you upload the wallet and the password, they say “Oh, it was compromised indeed. I’m sorry. :(”

Oh, ok. What’s the point of printing just the address?

I’m not an expert, so someone please tell me if I say anything wrong, but as far as I know, you don’t need to be online at all to generate a wallet and transfer bitcoins. Actually, you can do that with a computer that never has been online before.
A wallet is just a pair of numbers with some special proprieties that your computer generates randomly, one of them is public and the other is private. 
The network only needs to know the public number of the sending and receiving wallets of a transaction and a **confirmation** that the sender owns the private number of the sending wallet, which is basically an encrypted message, containing the transaction data, that could only be generated with the private number, which is easy to prove because it can be decrypted with the sender’s public number (and that’s the special properties the public/private pair must have, that is, they can be able to encrypt messages that can be decrypted by the other).
Also, it is possible that someone else generates the same wallet numbers as yours by lucky, but it’s really really improbable to happen. I think most improbable than to guess someone’s bank account id and password.
