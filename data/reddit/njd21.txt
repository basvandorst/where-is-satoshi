I’m not sure. We may see some FUD for some time here. Maybe not. I’m just speculating. 
And investors, please be wise. Posts like these are dangerous.

Yeah, it’s pretty unreal how much it’s pumped. Though I’m not complaining by any means.

Is anyone following the futures market closely or have a deep understanding of its nature in relation to Bitcoin? 
That's the one thing I believe that could "ruin" Bitcoin. Maybe not anytime soon obviously, but the precious metal market has been neutralized by the futures market due to the cash backed supply dilution. At that point, I'd expect the price to move sideways indefinitely similar to precious metals. But maybe that's not until the price is some absurd amount.

Oh, I was thinking longterm. Though I agree that the speed of growth will hit taper off with more capital injection.
The reason I brought this up is Bitcoin is very similar to partyhats in Runescape. Digital scarcity that leads to desire. In a free market, I could only see Bitcoin continue increasing in value due to the scarcity alone; however, my take is that only the futures market could halt its growth similar to gold.
It's a game of politics. I truly believe the reason why gold stagnated is to create the illusion that the dollar to doing better than it really is. Maybe not until 50-100k though.

This was the best ELI5 explanation ever.
Well done sir.

I'd give it another 5 years to mature. 
Though it's fun right now as a hobbyist.

Dumb idea. Absolutely not.

This is nothing but jive, turkey. Present usage does not equal future adoption.
I'm going to flip this with  [
And this  [  which clearly shows usage across all altcoins (Ethereum alone) well exceeds that of Bitcoin.

Then it's quite clear that the direction of Bitcoin is purely a SoV on a legacy ledger. It won't be a peer to peer currency and is going for digital gold.
LN will only serve a niche market. It's already been proven, mathematically, that it's impossible to onboard a significant amount of users into the second layer. There simply isn't enough blockspace. Downvote me all you want. Math speaks fact.
And spam costs money. Those inefficiencies cost Veriblock and Coinbase money.

Can you withdraw your coins from the exchange?
@_date: 2018-11-27 20:20:21
I would say that fast transactions and low fees are a prerequisite for spending. This alone isn’t enough as there still needs to be adoption and an easy UI (Which for us isn’t an issue, but you have to consider the average user).
I don’t think you’ll be able to avoid the limited supply issue. That’s one of the main selling points for BTC and why its price will most absolutely be manipulated in the future. 
If crypto does get adopted, I personally think BTC will become a SoV (Though in its current state it’s a poor one).

Yeah, it's rather unfortunate if it is another 10 years. I'm half hoping we see Lightning in 5-years. I personally have not used it yet and will start reading more into it to find out about it's current state (Though it seems it's still early in its infancy).
@_date: 2018-11-27 03:29:42


Well, that's why we need Lightning. The main chain is way too slow to do any real commerce.
Edit - Unless being used for large purchases.
@_date: 2019-01-12 19:26:08
It's very inconvenient to spend. Lightning needs significant improvements for on-boarding, otherwise Bitcoin will always be a HODL meme.  
Here's how I look at it:
* Millennial's value convenience.  Lightning in its present state it not convenient. On-boarding is a poor experience. We'll just wait to see if this improves in the future.
* Baby Boomers are scared of it. Nothing that can be done here. They're afraid of technology. Should lightning be a success, this may change.
For now, HODL it is. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 02:46:36
I agree. And nothing will. The finite supply will lead to hoarding. 
@_date: 2019-01-19 22:50:46
Definitely more involved.
LTC released started network expansion into LN as well. This will allow atomic swaps to BTC and vice versa in the future. 
Looking forward to see how the network grows this year.

2.5k is a strong support. So this is fairly reasonable.
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:01:31
This is awesome. Well done. 
@_date: 2019-05-31 01:49:12
You need a higher blocksize to scale. Otherwise you limit adoption.
Lightning Network does not solve the problem of well...actually on-boarding more more users. It's all dependent on an on-chain transaction.
But at this point, this discussion is pointless. Bitcoin will never increase its blocksize and any on-chain scaling effort will take place in altcoins. The narrative has changed and Bitcoin is shifting toward a secure storage of value with marginal scaling.
@_date: 2019-05-31 13:35:51
Okay, please post said evidence.
@_date: 2019-05-31 05:12:54
Yes, BTC has been around for 10-years. BCH has been around for less than 2-years. Having less usage at the time of this writing is expected. And for what its worth, BCH is already comparable to Litecoin in terms of on-chain usage.
Okay, so it won't increase the blocksize in our lifetime. The narrative still holds true and the on-chain scaling effort is an engineering problem that altcoins will solve.
