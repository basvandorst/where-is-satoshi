Even if that was true (it's not but for sake of argument), then you still have to wonder why these supposedly just as intelligent and educated non-degreed folks haven't found a method to obtain a degree yet.

Factually wrong. 
"84 percent.
On average, that is how much more money
a full-time, full-year worker with a Bachelor’s
degree can expect to earn over a lifetime than
a colleague who has no better than a high
school diploma"
And assuming this kid is in engineering or something? Much more than that.

Turing was a famous computer scientist. There's a movie about him starring Benedict Cumberbatch. 
Turing completeness refers to a system's ability to act as a universal Turing machine. Most Computer Science degrees will cover this in an upper class called "Automata Theory".
