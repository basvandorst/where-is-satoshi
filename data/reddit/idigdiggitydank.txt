A large portion of Japanese debt is held by the Japanese, which means there is less of a risk of spooking investors.  The USA is the strongest economy in the world.....  Comparing Italy to either of these countries is just craziness.  Comparing Italy to Greece makes a lot more sense. They are both locked into the same shitty treaty, and the both have very high debt loads.  This said the Italian market is much bigger, and more resilient than the Greek economy.  In the end I see most of the PIGS going down.

It's a flower not a veggie...  But exactly right, if you use the old chain for business the huge fines and if you use it for personal... Jail time.  Yes people still break the law but most people don't

Would your logic not then extend to anything you learn on any media?  Your statement is not logically consistent.

I disagree, and agree.  Governments will create digital currencies, but they will be nothing like bitcoin.  Bitcoin is based on a decentralized network, limited currency growth, and a strong public ledger.  A government based digital currency would likely have none of these.  The government would create server stacks to run the currency, they would be able to increase the currency to an unlimited extent, as that is what they love to do, and they would likely keep the public ledger away from prying eyes, but would likely have a light version that shows some transactions.  
IMO if you remove these 3 things from your currency you make it a lot less attractive compared to cryptos like bitcoin.  It gives people little to no incentive to choose government cryptos over bitcoin.  Also within 5 - 10 years bitcoin should be considerably bigger and more developed, which would mean it should be able to out compete any government crypto.
They only advantage the government might have is guaranteeing their crypto, but considering that is one of the big issues people are having with fiat, I don't foresee it being much of an advantage.

Maybe.... Here is a scenario that a sovereign could fuck with bitcoin.  Governments are able to spend lots of money on projects, so if government A decided that bitcoin was a hindrance, they could form data centers that mine bitcoin, with over 50% of mining power.  Once they do this they could change bitcoin to fit how they wanted to with a hard fork.  Not saying it would be easy, but it is possible.

Funny I find the show extremely anti corporation, but agree with what you are saying in principle as I can see it both ways.

I guess I disagree that people would not accept it.  If the Fed gov made a treaty with over governments they could easily create a law that they would expect everyone to follow
edit: Not saying I agree with the gov...

So you can't change the rules if you have a majority of mining power?  Honest question, my impression was different.  Are you saying if the majority of people don't agree the change could not happen?

I am really confused, this stance does not seem to be supported by facts.  If I were just using conjecture I would say its probably more closely tied to China, than the EU....
