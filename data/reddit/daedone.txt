Except the practicality of it. Unemployed homeless person doesn't have a bank account... no fixed address...don't most (or all) banks in the states require an account holder address? gotta mail the card somewhere...

As opposed to the executive order freezing transfer of funds to or from a cryptocurency? Then you have no assets.

Since you mentioned stock transactions, I'm going to make a basic assumption that you have several thousands of dollars in net worth, for someone like you, the banks are happy to waive fees, for someone like me, and the majority of the population, typically unless you have more than $5000 in the bank, you get charged fees.  
The main point is *for what*?? I would guess over 90-95% of people's transactions are done electronically either online, or at a retailer. How can they justify an essentially hands off client being charged for parking what little money they have, and never really interacting with their bank in person.  Data doesn't really cost much to store and transmit. This infrastructure is already in place, they don't need to build it out.
I pay about $15 a month, which is almost 200 a year, just for the privilege of having money in their bank. It used to be $10 a month, then they raised the rates "to make your plan even better" except there isn't really a cheaper plan, and they didn't really add anything of use to the plan for me. 
Sometimes a blatant cash grab really is just a blatant cash grab

For those of us in Canada, that would be what Bell Fibe is.

Where are you that fiber, and not cat5/6 is the defacto internal house wiring standard for low voltage?
