A little money?  You're supposed to throw in your entire life savings and take out an enormous loan like the rest of us.
Kidding...I think, welcome to crypto.
@_date: 2018-09-27 17:34:59
To those of you who have been into the workings of crypto for awhile, what exactly happens with 'network fees'? As in, where do they go? Miner addresses? Forgive my ignorance, just trying to learn.
@_date: 2018-08-06 01:42:59
Can you imagine the chastising you'd get if you had told everyone, back then, that in a little over 2 years that we would see 19k?  Lol

This is from 14 Jan 2015, when btc went from 1200 to 168:
Thought it was interesting to compare the similarities of sentiment from then to now, even though that year was a much larger % of decline...so far.

Good luck I guess

It's almost a rite of passage at this point

He'll get a container of spotted dick and take a picture of himself eating it and be like lol told you
@_date: 2018-05-23 03:34:46
I'd like to say yes but this is more realistic
@_date: 2018-08-09 11:54:38
@_date: 2018-05-23 03:37:24
Yes. Not as much as I'd like to yet though.
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:35:28
Oddly, I've had an usually large amount of friends/family ask me how to invest in crypto during the bear market more than during the bull run because "now it's more affordable".  I wasn't expecting that to happen since it seems attention usually dwindles with price.  How anomalous..
@_date: 2018-08-14 12:43:47
Not so much here, but Ive been seeing unprecedented levels of malice and salt all over the other crypto subs. I assume the mods here stay on top of that garbage.
@_date: 2018-05-26 16:58:17
Financially independently
@_date: 2018-05-29 23:24:17
They claim that *now*, but I'd bet the power of greed during bull runs overtakes at least half of them and they don't sell.
@_date: 2018-05-23 01:56:48
Bought at 17k AMA
@_date: 2018-05-23 03:35:23
10k USD. It wasn't more than I could afford to lose, though.
@_date: 2018-05-01 07:47:07
I like this terminology
@_date: 2018-05-24 17:57:17
If this is true it will up my stack 700%.  Please bears...
@_date: 2018-05-29 23:22:52
Ok whales you know what to do now

I don't think either extreme is very likely to happen.  We'll probably end up somewhere in the middle.  If full on digital currency becomes the sole way of the future I think it's quite far down the timeline still, probably outside of our lifetimes.
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:38:33
Salty bagholders. That's what happened.
@_date: 2018-06-28 21:23:33
Fuck futures and fuck Wall Street.  That is all.

Stuff is happening.  But after the stuff happens, other stuff will cause it to do other things.

@_date: 2017-06-29 10:48:51
I would say not at this point. Maybe when it was first emerging. It would be a money pit now. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 05:28:47
I like it personally. I'm not a huge fan of the founder, but the currency itself appears fast and reliable.
I have mixed feelings about Mr. Lee letting his coins go, but I think if he was organizing something to purely profit himself, why disclose it publicly?
@_date: 2017-09-13 09:44:14
You got me.  Eye started twitching for a second
