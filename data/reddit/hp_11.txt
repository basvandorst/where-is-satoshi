My guess is that it will go up to around 8000 before the fork and then go crashing down to 5000ish. 
Trust me I am a random guy on reddit

Nobody can be sure. A lot od people predicted a crash after bth fork, the price went up instead. This is just my estimate but honestly if it were ever to go down this much it would be after the fork

Pretty much the same thing tjat happened during btg fork but on a larger scale. Btc will raise as people dump their alts to btc. Alts fall. People will go back to alts and btc will start falling and alts raising
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:37:22
Not aware of this, could you provide tldr of what happened?
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:02:47
If there were no transactions even for low prices there would be no bitcoin. Stop regreting spending your bitcoin, it helps the market grow. Rather pay using btc and buy the equal amount you spent

Possibly fake but definitely heterosexual

Looks sweet!

Yeah but people will flood back to alts, causing them to go up and btc down and then people will start panic selling. This is why we saw a dip right after the btcg fork. This one could be bigger though. 
But then again nobody really knows what will happen so I would recommend to hodl, relax and keep buying more if you believe in the technology

At block 494 784, sometime around that date. It is not precise though and it could change
@_date: 2017-10-19 10:00:06
It got back to 5600-5700 in one day. This dip was definitely healthy but rather short-lasting and I would not expect a rapid rise in the next few days
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:47:51
5900 guys!!

Seriously though. You can see your transaction within minutes, it only takes a while to confirm.
When sending money between banks it can take days before youre even sure if you have sent it. Waiting for confirmations isn't that bad..

I guess this has to be Cryptorubble propaganda. There is no way this statement can be so idiotic without a reason
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:38:47
Maybe provide more details and reasoning?
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:07:07
Agreed. When I was buying BTC it was at 2500. My dad was furious because I was "throwing my money away". Now every passing milestone feels sweeter and sweeter
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:31:10
I love how you're casually asking for 5 700 dollars. Kinda funny
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:25:58
There probably won't be any drastic drops in a few upcoming days due to people buying/converting into btc to get free 2x coins. But there is a pretty high probability that it will come crashing down after that so I would watch out for it
@_date: 2017-10-31 11:50:27
Or it can drop and sp00k us to death
@_date: 2017-10-14 11:31:17
I bought at around 2500. It was only 0,2 btc but I did not have more at that time. My dad told me how stupid I was and that I am wasting money and now it has more than doubled. Proving him wrong feels better than the money I got out of it
@_date: 2018-04-15 06:51:13
Since may 2017. I only wish I could buy more at that time
