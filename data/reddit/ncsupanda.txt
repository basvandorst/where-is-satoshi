"In this phase the exchange of funds shall require the user to trust us to pass these funds onto the target/destination address. We aim to eliminate this trust in a later phase once the lightning atomic swaps are available (shout out to Conner Fromknecht, Lightning Labs) ��."
Shouldn't this be visible on the actual ZigZag site and not just the blog? I'm sure current users would expect the functionality to be what you are planning for your end state. If this is where you are then you're really acting the same as Shapeshift/Changelly, right?

What would be the difference in using the App versus just using their website?

I don't want any of your retarded little currency either.
Send the Bitcoin right there.

I want to start off by saying thank you for all of the hard work you've done for Bitcoin. It's insanely interesting to read of what you've already done and are currently working on, so here's a huge thanks from me. Onto my questions:
1) For someone who is interested in doing development work for Bitcoin or Altcoins, how do you suggest they learn?
2) I'm a senior double majoring in Electrical and Computer engineering and have been wanting for a few years now to graduate and be able to work a job related to Bitcoin. How should I set myself up to work in the Bitcoin field?

Called Amazon just yesterday, asked if they would ever accept Bitcoin, and was told that the lady I talked to, all of the workers around her, her supervisor and her general manager had no idea what I was talking about. 
But, you know, everyone knows about Bitcoin. 
You are looking for a get-rich-quick scheme, not a real investment. Nobody who knows anything about investing  invests in something and then just abandons it in less than a year.
Good luck in future endeavors.

I wouldn't. Why trust a mobile app with your Bitcoin?
If you don't own the private key, then you own nothing.

Why couldn’t hackers break into the “controlled” system, mine Bitcoins, drive the price up through market the manipulation of let’s say, lots of hype, only to dump their Bitcoins at the top of the market, thus crashing the prices for the unsuspecting?
