No. You can trade your btc directly to ETH. also, if you use GDAX (which you already have an account with since its owned by coin base) the fees are WAY lower than coinbase fees. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:14:46
You DID single it out though, that's why I responded. You didn't specifically say it was a shitcoin, but you did say it has scaling issues, which it does. 
But to say Bitcoin has development is insane. The community and development team can't even agree on a simple blocksize increase, let alone any REAL scaling solutions. Also, a lot of the bitcoin community is obsessed with following God Satoshis vision for some stupid reason instead of going the right direction. Satoshi isn't around anymore, and he certainly didn't have all the answers when he created bitcoin. Some things have to change regardless of what the creator wanted. Bitcoin isn't keeping up, and a lot of alt coins are at least 2-3 years ahead of bitcoin in development. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:00:30
How inefficient.

IF bitcoin ever gets lightning network...
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:54:23
Lol. IF lightning network ever comes. They said 6 months over 2 years ago. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:26:13
Haha. That isn't true at all. But you keep telling yourself that. For example, Ethereum processes 4X the transactions of bitcoin daily, and yet the fees are 100 times lower than Bitcoin. Right now I'd bet there's less than 5 "shitcoins" out there that scale worse than bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 14:29:04
SALT. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:59:11
Funny. Those "trash" coins you talk about probably all scale better than bitcoin and are actually useable. Almost every single alt coin out there performs better than grandpa bitcoin. I think we all know which coin is the REAL trash coin. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:09:20
Of course Ethereum has scaling issues too, but Bitcoin has been around for way longer, and yet Ethereum is already WAY ahead of Bitcoin in terms of development and scaling. Honestly the amount of development on Bitcoin is seriously disappointing. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:00:45
Haha lightning is a centralized pipe dream that has been "just around the corner" forever now. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:12:21
First off, your central premise is flawed. Bitcoin is very much NOT working well. Ridiculously high transaction fees, long wait times, centralized (Chinese miners), energy inefficient, TONS of political drama, and an outdated PoW system. Tons of other cryptos solved these problems years ago, and the bitcoin community can't even agree on a simple block size increase or segwit. 
The fact of the matter is Grandpa bitcoin can't keep up. Proof of Work coins are going to die and be dinosaur bones a decade from now. Bitcoin might be the only PoW coin that survives, but not in any healthy manner, and sure as hell won't be number one in market cap anymore. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:14:18
Will never ever happen. Other cryptos are actually solving problems that bitcoin isn't. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:12:11
You just didn't wait long enough
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:46:47
Pretty good actually. Made bigger gains than bitcoin this year. 
The king of all shitcoins is bitcoin. How are those hours long confirmation times, 5$ fees, and no actual development working out for you? 
Only a matter of time before people wake up and realize bitcoin is worthless compared to other cryptos. Store of value my ass. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:05:41
No. Bitcoin can't just be "updated" with all of these cool features. Specifically, the future of blockchain is proof of stake, which bitcoin will never be. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:10:53
That's not... How any of this works. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:52:33
Lol. You've obviously never been through a correction period. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:39:10
Or better yet, just buy and hodl an actual functioning crypto instead of this geriatric piece of shit. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:11:27
Oh wow. Someone insults your poor geriatric coin. Big fucking deal.  Ethereum actually has a use case besides just "store of value" or a useless medium of exchange with ridiculous fees. It isn't a crime for someone to like a different crypto besides the one you've invested in. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:10:20
Bitcoin will never be ready for volume. Sooner or later another crypto will take over btcs spot. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:28:02
That's fucking awesome. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:09:05
Use a different crypto. Bitcoin is slow and wil charge you ridiculous high fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:33:43
Hahaha. No. You bitcoin maximalists just don't understand that bitcoin will always be limited in scope. Mostly because of PoW, but for lots of other reasons too. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:35:36
Haha. To actually be money you need instant transactions and waaaay lower than 5$ fees. Bitcoin isn't even close to money right now. Its barely a suitable gold alternative. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:46:09
Only took 10 fucking years. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:07:57
Bitcoin doesn't have a roadmap. Bitcoin development is ridiculously slow.
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:58:45
No. That isn't true at all. PoW is entirely unnecessary. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:02:41
Except cash and other money has official  backing from governments, and doesn't have ridiculous fees like BTC to use., and doesn't fluctuate dramatically either. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:36:12
Hey look everybody. Bitcoin core has made bitcoin transactions 30% cheaper! Now you only have to pay 20$ instead of 30$. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:58:50
Haha. No. Proof of Stake is the future man. And its WAAAAY better AND more secure than proof of work. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:09:32
What a shitty waste of technology. Bitcoin isn't a store of value like Gold is, because bitcoin  is only worth what people are willing to pay for it, and has no other usefulness as it can't be used as a metal in manufacturing like gold can be. Bitcoin without scalability is legit hot dog shit. 
This whole bitcoin as a store of value is a complete crock of shit and waste of a good technology. Thank God some other cryptos will actually become useful soon
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:22:07
Bahah. Didn't realize there are still so many fools who think ETH is a scam. I think you feel threatened hah. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:27:51
You use it buy a real crypto that doesn't have stupid insane fees, long processing times, and a community that isn't split with tons of drama.

Ledger nano S is the best. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 16:24:05
I think the writing is on the wall. Daily Bitcoin transactions are less than what they were 2 years ago. Nobody uses bitcoin, nobody wants bitcoin except to buy alts. Bitcoin is going the way of Yahoo and will usher in a new wave of cryptos that can actually scale, and actually have a decent use case. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 17:42:54
Even if that's part of it that just proves my point. Only exchanges are using it because people are using it to buy and sell alts. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:21:35
I don't think YOU'RE getting it. You don't know the future. You just got lucky. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 22:06:25

Glad you joined in, but I'm 99% certain were going to be seeing a pullback soon in 3...2....1...
@_date: 2017-08-06 14:42:31
Makes sense. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-06-18 01:02:06
Well, I don't mean to say that bitcoin never improved, just that it's at a point now where progress has slowed to a crawl, and short of completely changing protocols somehow, it WILL be replaced sometime in the future.  At some point Proof of Work will be obsolete and every decent crypto will be Proof of Stake. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 23:09:22
Gotcha. So then what's the point of Ethereum then? Is it just easier to program smart contracts for ETH, or what? I personally hold both bitcoin and ETH, but I don't see why companies would move to ETH for smart contracts if this is already possible in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 05:20:56
There is no reason a blockchain spending electricity as a resource makes it in any way valuable. Proof of Stake DOES work and is already running on several alts, and Ethereum has a highly successful testnet running it RIGHT now. 
Proof of work is infinitely wasteful, and actually way LESS secure than proof of stake. A 51% attack on a PoS chain is FAR more costly then a PoW chain. 
All a 51% attacker has to do do attack a PoW chain is own a lot of mining rigs or mining pools, attack the chain, then sell his rigs for profit, or attack it again if the community hard forks. To attack a PoS chain, you'd have to buy 51% of the supply, and attack it. However, if the community decides to hard fork, you're SOL unless you want to buy 51% of the tokens again, at which point the community could still hard fork until you run out of resources. There's literally no economic incentive to 51% attack a PoS chain. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 05:07:54
Proof of work is an insane waste of resources and serves no purpose. Solving random useless math problems isn't what gives bitcoin, or any crypto, its value. Proof of Stake will be better in EVERY way. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 22:02:22
Not gonna happen. Something better will replace bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 05:23:55
I've never understood this argument against Proof of Stake. Sure, the rich would be able to stake more currency and make more money, but it's the same way in proof of work or in any system ever. The rich get to buy all the mining equipment and generate more money that way as well. With proof of Stake, at least the rich and poor will be making equal percentages. With proof of work, the rich often have access to things the poor don't. (Leverage on buying cheaper mining equipment, ability to relocate to areas with cheap electricity, etc.)
I'm still not convinced that proof of stake is a viable system yet, but I don't think that this is a good argument against it. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 03:16:26
Lmao.  No. Just no. Bitcoin is not going to 500$. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 05:33:37
Lol. Okay. But hand waving and ad hominem attacks won't suddenly make your arguments valid or make bitcoin anything more than a shit coin. 
Your only legit argument is that proof of stake is less established than proof of work, but someday that will change. Proof of work is garbage and random useless work isn't necessary to secure the chain when a stake works 10x better. Work smarter, not harder. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 00:25:20
The internet has constantly improved unlike Bitcoin. Bitcoin can't improve, other than LN which is garbage and will always be garbage.   
I would argue that Crypto as a whole is the internet, but bitcoin is only AOL.
@_date: 2018-06-17 23:06:02
Nobody needs "digital gold" that can fluctuate in price like crazy. Something like DGX would be a much better digital gold than bitcoin. Bitcoin doesn't solve any problems in any useful way, other than being "decentralized" (which it's not btw), its pretty useless. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 00:26:46
Not really. Almost ANY alt coin could function as a digital gold better than bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:41:35
This is why bitcoin technology sucks.  Ethereum has super fast processing times and this never happens
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:57:45
Fundamentals? Like how bitcoins fundamentals are all pretty much garbage compared to every other cryptocurrency?
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:39:33
The problem STILL isn't with Ethereum, but with a wallet creator.  Nothing has been proposed yet how to fix this latest issue, so again, maybe people should get their code audited before putting it on the blockchain. This kind of shit can and WILL happen with root stock as well. Its literally not different at all. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:51:47
Not true in the slightest. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:56:20
No place for begging here. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:18:09
Yes. Ethereum is very very good. It will for sure be around for a long time. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:13:40
Definitely agree. Bitcoin will be king for a while, and it always might have a portion of the gold market, but yeah I think it will be dethroned eventually. No idea what will take its place though. Pretty confident it will be something proof of stake though. 
Maybe something like dash? Idk. Don't know too much about dash tbh though 
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:03:06
Look at other cryptocyrrencies then. There are plenty of other projects out there besides bitcoin. Most do everything better than bitcoin too. Its only a matter of time before another coin unseats bitcoin. Bitcoin will never scale very well because of its proof of work system. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:48:40
Little bit of a correction, little bit of FUD. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:21:59
Yeah. The Technology HAS improved. But its called other cryptocurrencies. Proof of Work cryptos will never make a good currency. 
Development on Bitcoin is waaay too slow and will eventually get left behind by some faster cheaper proof of stake coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:24:13
Lol. No. Maybe some other shitty PoW cryptos, but most likely this  would only work on Bit coin because bitcoin is pretty much the only crypto with outrageous fees, long transaction times and ridiculous scaling problems. 
However, both BTC and BCH are trash.

I'm grateful for the horse and buggy too, but that doesn't mean I'm not glad that it died and made room for cars. 
You just made a REALLY shitty comparison. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:11:52
Yeah... I'm begging to think that this could actually be in a bubble about to burst right now... We are waaay overdue for a correction...
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:58:48
Whatever man. The point still stands. Bitcoin fees and transaction times are ridiculous. It's only a matter of time before another crypto unseats it. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:56:23
How is that not true with proof of work? 
Because all poor people can buy expensive mining rigs, and have access to cheap electricity right?
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:51:30

@_date: 2017-11-23 06:34:24
I don't "hate" Bitcoin. In fact I'm really grateful for it. It started the crypto revolution and laid the ground work to change the world. However, Bitcoin has not aged well. It's a sick dinosaur and it needs to be put down. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:10:30
I'm personally big on Ethereum, OmiseGO, NEO and ARK. Those coins will all be very successful, especially OmiseGO imo. 
If you're looking for a moonshot though, EOS might be a good one to look into as well... However, just be warned that there is a lot of negative sentiment against EOS right now. Its possible that EOS is entirely and completely a scam, but many people called Ethereum a scam too in the early days. I'm leaning towards the truth being somewhere in the middle, but if it manages to accomplish everything it says it will do, it would be a game changer. Wouldn't put much into it right now though. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:19:49
I'd probably sell as soon as it became a life changing amount of money for me. Which would probably be around 50k-100k. Wouldn't be a millionaire or anything by any sense, but I could buy a rental house or two and live pretty comfortably I think. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:46:08
Right. Hour long confirmations, 5 dollar fees, and insane electricity usage is "doing it right"
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:14:30
There's no way its elon musk. Satoshi Nakamoto is probably dead because he hasn't moved or touched his bitcoins in forever. Elon musk could have definitely used the money back when he was starting Tesla i'm sure. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:24:49
Right. Sure bitcoin may be an improvement from FIAT, but almost every single alt coin is cheaper and more advanced than Bitcoin ever will be. Development on bitcoin is way too slow and will eventually eat the dust of a technologically superior proof of stake coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:01:50
Wow. People are still salty about that. Stupid fucking shit I swear. The community gathers around and votes to save people millions but somehow that's a bad thing?
Idiots. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:28:34
Sorry but no. Satoshi Nakamoto is probably dead. I think evidence that he's not moved any of his coins is proof of that. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:37:38
This is why proof of work is shit, and proof of stake is the future.

@_date: 2017-09-27 21:12:31
I seriously doubt bitcoin will hit these prices. Bitcoin will not be worth that much unless it can be used well as a currency. As long as bitcoin is proof of work, it will always be an inferior currency to those that are proof of stake. - Theres no denying it. 
I'm sure bitcoin will still grow, but I highly doubt it will ever be used more than just a digital gold system. It might replace gold as a good store of value, but it will never be a great currency because of the proof of work system. Eventually some proof of stake currency will become the highest market cap and a better currency than bitcoin could ever be.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:38:28

Chinese marketplaces didn't even budge. Pure FUD. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:32:30
I think you're wrong. A fiat cryptocurrency could work on its own. Fiat crypto alone would be great for trading assets and reducing middlemen like the banks. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:34:39
Agreed. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 21:11:23
Crypto gonna crypto
@_date: 2017-10-07 03:13:31
Most alt coins and ICOs use Ethereums platform. Bitcoin is MySpace/AOL. Ethereum is the new facebook but you'd never know judging by all the Bitcoin maximalists here. Bitcoin will likely always have a place, but its technology is way outdated and will eventually get replaced by proof of stake technology. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:15:06
You're fooling yourself if you think that when China announces a ban on Bitcoin that trading levels will eventually return back to normal in China. Sure, some trading will still be done, but not even close to the same extent. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:54:42
I think we're probably gonna hang around 4100-4200 for a little while. Probably a week or so. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:25:02
Where did you see news of no bans but regulation instead? Last I saw the big major exchanges are shutting down not being regulated?
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:03:53
Dude. Maybe you should Google before calling palm beach confidential a scam. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:34:39
I think they could still take it out in other currencies though, or use decentralized exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:52:31
Ever since metropolis was released, it's fees have consistently been pennies on the dollar. Even less than a penny in many cases. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 20:26:12
Its almost a crypto law that as soon as you invest, price will go down. Lol. Price could drop 50%, but eventually it will always go back up. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:38:28
Or, it could lead to other parts of the world/currencies to cash out and burst the bubble. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 05:00:52
Oh really? Well then please show us how it's done. Go hack us some ETH please. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:51:16
You fuckin serious?
@_date: 2017-09-11 22:54:04
And every time in between
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:21:05
Lol yep. This is why I don't trade. Markets are wayyy too fkin unpredictable. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:52:51
Shit, what's wrong with teamviewer? I just installed it the other day...
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:17:01
Holy shit! Price went up after all bans announced?
It really is true that the only thing worse than bad news is the rumor of bad news. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:34:39
Agreed. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 05:24:36
Do not invest in Bitcoin over your own business. That is a foolish thing to do. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:39:48
And yet, it's still a better currency than bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 01:42:52
Lol. Very tempting. But there's just no way its not a ponzi scheme. If I knew for sure that it wasn't, I could literally retire today lol.  Those types of gains just don't happen in the real world. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:39:58
If amazon really does start accepting Bitcoin, 6K will be nothing more than a pebble on the road to 10K. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:03:37
Then you paid more than you could have
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:52:34
Yeah! 20Xing your money is a really stupid idea. 
"Instead you should just give your money to us so WE can make money on it instead!"
@_date: 2017-09-13 23:28:18
Most likely it's a ponzi scheme 
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:34:39
I think they could still take it out in other currencies though, or use decentralized exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 04:50:57
Of course the markets are reacting to the news right now. But neither article shows any sources and even says in the article that the Chinese government hasn't said anything yet. Shitty journalism. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 19:13:01
MLMs are NOT pyramid schemes. Equating the two is false. Some mlms actually provide real value and real income. Don't confuse the two. Mlms are here to stay. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:00:03
Most alts are crashing now because they're trading it in for bitcoin because of the "free money"  coming up with all the bitcoin hardforks. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:09:43
ETH has sub penny fees and confirms in less than a few minutes. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 06:28:59
Not always true. Scarcity alone does not equal value. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 03:07:15
It's not a scam. People are just in major denial. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 03:07:59
Lots of rape and incest?
@_date: 2017-09-28 03:24:55
Haha. Good one!
@_date: 2018-07-18 03:12:29
Nobody cares about viacoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 14:45:22
That bitcoin technology is outdated. The bitcoin maximalists don't want to admit that companies and developers are leaving bitcoin in droves to build on Ethereum and other platforms. Bitcoin really is like Netscape or MySpace. Proof of work will naturally always have higher fees and less scalability. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:10:48
How? Btcc announced it themselves. I think you're in denial. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 15:31:34
People, please stop asking when the price fluctuates 5%. 5% is nothing in the crypto world. Not every 5% dip can be explained. Crypto gonna crypto. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:26:50
Yep. They simply guessed. And not even correctly at that, since it looks like China is only banning CNY to crypto. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 04:42:21
Save yourself the trouble and buy Ethereum. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:46:54
Yeah but, as far as demand goes, ETH processes waaay more transactions per day than bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:51:12
Dump while you still can. Maybe it bounces back to 500, maybe it doesn't. But one thing is true, eventually this will be a shitcoin.
Id bet that it will never see 400 again. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:12:57
Yes. Coins like Ethereum have a really good ratio right now and lots of big news incoming. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 02:39:43
Transaction fees have plummeted! /s lol
@_date: 2017-10-07 03:02:04
Lol at everyone in this thread trashing Ethereum saying it's a scam. How can you deniers still think it's a scam? Haha. Wow. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 07:30:21
No. An increase as small as that would definitely NOT have sacrificed decentralization. But It would have allowed bitcoin to stay relevant and give it a fighting chance until scaling solutions like lightning finally become ready. But now ever since segwit 2x was shot in the foot by the community, crypto enthusiasts have started to realize just how sorely outdated btc is. 
Now bitcoin will simply be a relic while alts will reign supreme. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 21:28:41
You can't mine bitcoin with a GPU. Only with ASICS. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:05:04
Looking at you, bit connect. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 05:55:07
Ugh. So much for those gains. The last hour barely cracked 2.8k and keeps going back down. I'm so impatient!
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:03:37
So are you saying there's guaranteed to be a split in November?
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:05:33
Coinbase is backed up due to the stampede of everyone withdrawing. Use the search button before posting man. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:00:26
So are you saying it's guaranteed there will be a split in November?
@_date: 2017-07-19 16:39:13
Is it even technically possible to reach 100%? Won't there always be that one guy out there that doesn't conform?
@_date: 2017-07-22 05:53:26
Can confirm. Completely new to bitcoin. Signed up for coin base and bought a bunch OF ETH and bitcoin early this week. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 14:00:06
There are... A lot of ways to send money with ZERO fees.
