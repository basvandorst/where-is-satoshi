Coinbase is your best bet, although you won't be able to purchase the coins until probably early next week after verification and connecting your bank account.
You can try market places like bitcointalk.org or  on IRC to get a better deal if you can pay cash. And it's quicker

Of course other miners will follow suit. The current amount of money it costs for a reward is more than the BTC is worth. Its not profitable and their ROI is negative.

One thing I need cleared up: Are we to assume LE flipped Curtis Green (aka flush) when he got arrested Jan 17 for the possession charge that DPR and inigo mention? 9 days later, on Jan 26 the theft occurs, which is actually DEA SA Bridges using Green's account with admin access. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 05:12:53
Just seems like a lot to give up for a possession charge. Unless they were watching Green previously because they knew he was associated with SR.

Would highly recommend you don't margin trade on Kraken. 
For example, today anybody who had a margin position got liquidated because their trading system failed due to, what they claimed, DDOS attack. ETH lost about 400%, went from $96 to $26 during the attacks. BTC went to $1358, while all other exchanges were rallying.

Coinbase is insured against employee theft and hacking in an amount that exceeds the average value of online bitcoin it holds at any given time. Specifically, Coinbase's insurance policy would respond in the event that bitcoin stored in Coinbase was lost or stolen as a result of a breach of our physical security, cyber security, or as a result of employee theft.
They say 97% of funds in cold storage.

Today I literally had my first issue. Tried to acquire $500 worth of BTC from Circle and got caught up in their "identity verifier" thing a mabobber. They said they'll get back to me in a few days, my purchase was cancelled.
So instead I took my business to Coinbase today, worked fine.

 up to 1000 instant via CC
@_date: 2015-02-21 01:55:07
You have to figure out where you sent the coins. The address wasn't in your clipboard by accident so you got it from somewhere. Also even if you added, or erased a single letter from the address, the chances it's another valid BTC address is very low.
Once you find the transaction paste the address to txn hash here and we can try and help further.

Well they are acting like a 'bank'
They buy and sell out of their own holdings. 
It's not a p2p exchange.

Bill said bitcoin is "cutting edge" @ 12:55.
Case closed.
@_date: 2015-02-21 15:43:12
Yes, I said that. There are CC with IDs on them. It is pretty common in the US. The selfie is just ANOTHER verification method they use, its not the only one.

I have not used LBC in a while, but I think once the BTC is released out escrow it reflects in your LBC account. You are then able to withdraw the funds to your BitGo wallet
@_date: 2015-02-11 20:51:39
How will you stop charge backs of stolen cards?
@_date: 2015-03-10 03:52:26
You probably just have to turn on the volume indicator in settings.
@_date: 2015-02-18 20:04:31
Wrong, they have NOT frozen BTC and LTC withdrawals.
There is still over a month until they shutdown withdrawals.... They said March 25.
@_date: 2015-02-11 20:53:43
Also wait until you start doing some real volume, they will shut you down just like they have numerous other 'exchanges'
@_date: 2015-02-21 16:12:10
They need a picture of your ID and a selfie.
@_date: 2015-03-01 23:44:09
I don't think Samsung is interested in making a crypto wallet. But phones that are equipped with NFC would have the capability of wireless bitcoin payments via 3rd party software 
@_date: 2015-02-14 05:14:45
and another one bites the dust.
@_date: 2015-02-19 23:33:52
Today Stripe launched bitcoin payments and Lyft uses Stripe as their payment processor.
@_date: 2015-03-03 04:02:54
Check your localbitcoin account, your funds should be there.
I haven't used LBC in a while but remember that sellers did not payout directly to your wallet, but rather the BTC in escrow would be released to your LBC wallet. Then you can withdraw from there.
@_date: 2015-03-11 18:37:00
Limbo can be the time between when a transaction hits the chain and when it gets confirmed.
@_date: 2015-02-11 20:46:33
Who do you use as a payment processor?
@_date: 2015-02-21 23:21:25
Your seed is a backup of your keys.
A wallet is simply a collection of private keys. Backup the wallet.dat file if you don trust the seed.
@_date: 2015-02-21 15:28:50
You have to submit a passport or State issued ID which will have your name on it which they can cross reference to the name on your card and the name on your whole circle account??
@_date: 2015-02-19 02:18:32
Or Willy and Chang bot
@_date: 2015-02-22 07:47:17
 on IRC
@_date: 2015-02-13 21:48:16
Haha, this guy is such a troll
@_date: 2015-02-07 16:24:49


Dude, they take you to a payment processor to complete the payment. That URL of the checkout page is not the main site.
Its not SolSuite or w/e asking you for your details; It's their terminal 'BMT Micro'
@_date: 2015-02-22 06:44:00
It would be hard but theoretically, yes. 
Tumble your coins to be safe. BitcoinFog or Helix
@_date: 2015-02-12 04:14:24
Try 
@_date: 2015-02-20 23:08:50
We are not talking about your account being hijacked, but rather your  CC, or identity, being stolen, then an account opened in that name. With the selfie thats another verification that you are the person in the ID picture.  
@_date: 2015-02-18 20:02:51
~3% is the industry standard for CC transactions so you won't be able to find any exchange that doesn't relay that fee to you.
@_date: 2015-02-07 16:20:18
Why is BMT Micro not a trusted terminal? They are PCI compliant...
You realize that they need your address to run your credit card to make sure you didn't steal it. When you use credit card in stores you are usually asked for ID to verify you are the owner of the card. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 15:30:46
One private key per address. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 00:56:58
Only a few days late.
@_date: 2015-02-19 22:07:01
Would this be able to run on a Skyhook?
@_date: 2015-02-09 18:40:04
You won't be able to find one in the states. You'll have to turn to an offshore processor if you want to sell BTC for CC.
@_date: 2015-02-11 20:48:11
How long have you been live? Stripe will kick you off soon once they figure out you're selling digital currency.
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:58:37
You can't compare to 2013.
The crash in 2013 was due to a hack of 800,000 BTC.
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:41:12
[Maybe this](
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:43:26
So what is it that you'll be doing?
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:14:24
Yes, many MANY many people have the same issue. And Coinbase will not give you a reasoning on why it was restricted.
The best thing you can do is switch to Gemini.
@_date: 2017-06-01 10:22:58
Because the txn hash is not on the blockchain anymore.
Or you can search the address you sent to and see if they ever had that incoming txn
@_date: 2017-06-01 02:14:41
Yes. Txns with too low of fees that will never get confirmed will be rejected.
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:59:56
Idk how old OP is, but by that time, hopefully he won't have too 
@_date: 2015-02-21 05:09:00
What does that have to do with anything? And there are many credit cards with an ID picture actually. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 03:15:52


can anyone ELI5?
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:13:27
You may have been a target for somebody trying to get into your account. Is your Coinbase email tied to any Bitcoin related postings or websites?
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:04:03
They already have that 
Also, the beauty of Bitcoin is that you don't have to use traditional banking, so why would you put it into an IRA? The only advantage to IRA is that you can't touch it and it's tax free. Just put your BTC on a paper wallet and don't touch it until you're 62.
@_date: 2017-06-07 02:08:23
@_date: 2017-06-16 13:12:13
The quick answer is because of arbitrage (selling for one price at one place, and buying for a cheaper price at another place). It's a way of the free markets balancing itself out.

Yes and no. When BTC transactions are sent, a full input has to be spent. So what you are seeing is the original sender, call him Bob, sending BTC to the receiver, Jim. One of the receiving addresses is Jim's and the other address is Bob's change back address for the rest of the input.
