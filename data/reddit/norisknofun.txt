I don't think TigerDirect will hold the coins. They are in the business of selling hardware and not in the investing business. It would be a huge risk for them to hold the coins. They might hold a small amount of btcs after they paid of all the expenses.
I think most people will rebuy their coins anyways. (atleast the bulls)

He is talking about the guy who bought SatoshiDice.

This whole pishing atempt is so stupid.
Isn't the beauty of bitcoin that you can receive money without giving away your details? There is no need for proving that you own the address. Being able to use the address is already enough.
If it was legit blockhain.info would just post an announcement on their site and sent the 100 btc to the wallet with a link to the transaction so everybody could see it.

Of course it is possible, otherwise nobody would be scared.
The only way to verify that MtGox is in control of as many BTCs as they claim is if they show them in the Blockchain and move them as prove that they control those addresses.

I found out about this app because lots of my friends have been making the switch after the recent Whatsapp News.
Even though I'm not greatly concerned that Whatsapp will turn "evil" I still thought that using an app that encrypts my messages would be a great idea.
When I saw that I could pay for the App via Bitcoin without using the playstore I was a little hyped because it was my first purchase with Bitcoin I couldn't do otherwise. (I don't want to give google my creditcard info and paypal is not an alternative).
Only downside: It's not open source.

what makes this site better than the three, four that are already out there?
@_date: 2014-02-19 21:18:03
so kinda like bit.gg?

It is exactly like fractional reserve banking, the only difference being that the customer of the bank knows about it.
For mtgox it would be stealing.

While googling whatsapp alternatives I also found [telegram](

The customers give the bank (mtgox) 100k bitcoins. The bank only holds 10k bitcoins ands invests the other 90k bitcoins somewhere else.
On paper now there are 190k bitcoins, because all the customers together think they are still in control of their 100k, even though in reality it's only 10k. This only works as long as Mtgox doesn't have to payout more then 10k at once.
The only way to stop fractional reserve practices would be if everybody only uses their own wallets.
As soon as you are using online wallets or exchanges, you are giving up control of your coin, and the websites could do fractional reserve banking.

When you are greedy stupid person it is easy to convince yourself to throw money into Mtgox

According to their website they only have one store. The one that posted.
The picture is a little outdated though. So the red box should extend to the right around "Sushi Bay"

I guess in the end it comes down to which site has more volume.
@_date: 2014-02-07 23:37:31
I think you got it wrong. 
If you put in 10k in a bank, they only have to hold 3% and can reinvest 97% of the 10k, this can go in an endless loop and you get to a certain value as a limit. The thing is the amount of actual money still is only 10k, the rest of the money supply is essentialy a bunch of IOUs.
This would work with BTCs aswell.
[This] ( wikipedia article explains it quite well.
Now imagine instead of a bank we use an online exchange, and instead of **physical** money, we have BTCs (both share the property that they can't be multiplied).
Just so we are on the same page:
I don't think MtGox is doing that kind of fractional reserve banking.
My point is only that some day there could be a btc-bank that invests, lends and takes btc, and if they wanted too they could do fractional reserve banking.

I like my risk and my fun in moderate amounts.

For the hacker it might be..
@_date: 2014-02-14 12:40:52
I just googled it and I think it is a password recovery tool.

There is a site by wher you can purchase "goxcoins" for "realbitcoins" its  I haven't tried it out but I think you have to make a gox accound and send bitcoins to their site. After they got it they send the goxcoins to your new gox account since you still can withdraw bitcoins internally to another gox account.
I personally wouldn't risk it. There is a reason why the price on Mtgox is so low. And there is enough reason to believe that they are insolvent. (If you are really solvent there is no reason to not disclose that information)
I also wouldn't give Mtgox my business since they are very unreliable and untrustable.
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:42:30
Yeah that's my concern aswell. There are some other alternatives that have open source :

It would be ironic if his name was something like "Poor-Man"
"Ka-shing" is also not his family name but his first name. His family name would be Li.
In China the family name always goes first and is usually easy recognizable by having only one syllable like Li, Liu, Wang etc.

Chinese often are naming their children with a hidden phonetic meaning in it. So it's even funnier if you consider that his parents were giving him his name on purpose.
