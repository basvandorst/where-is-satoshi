Because hashes are designed to be a 'general purpose' constraint solving problem: that is, breaking hashes is (loosely speaking) NP-Hard. And it's a mathematical theorem that if anything is quantum resistant, then NP-hard problems are too.

Then there's no difference between quantum and classical computers anyway, and (digital) crypto is literally impossible anyway.

Hilariously wrong. Something about twice as large as a Dwave with Y-oriented field controls could crack a key on the order of a day.

No, block mining requires reversing hashes, which is a whole nother level of difficult. If quantum computers are able to do that, then it would also mean that they would be able to break quantum-resistant cryptography; any and all modern cryptography would be broken.

It could break a given private key, one at a time -- allowing them to gradually take wallets. It wouldn't be the whole blockchain at once.
But people who say "oh it could just fork to get quantum resistance" I think are drastically underplaying the level of complexity there. You think the current turmoil is scary? Imagine that fork. Right now, people just need to update their clients at some point in order to start getting new features. Switching to a quantum resistant blockchain would mean everyone would need a new wallet, and would have to /deliberately move their currency over/. Example timeline:
- Jan 2023, group announces that they almost have a full quantum computer, will release to companies in July
- Feb 2023, Bitcoin Core announces that in response they have quantum resistant code ready, will deploy start of June
- June 2023: Anyone that has no downloaded the new wallet stops being able to use bitcoin. Hard fork happens. People can still download the new wallet later, though, and get their coins later, until...
- July 2023: Companies start buying quantum computers. Now, anyone who hasn't downloaded their new wallet has basically given them away to the first person to spend the 5 minutes breaking their private key. Basically, anyone who hasn't switched forfeits their money.
This is why I prefer already quantum-resistant currencies, like Curecoin or QRL.
