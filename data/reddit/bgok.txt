Several things:
* The KeepKey bitcoin wallet has a big, bright screen that is protected by impact resistant cover.
* KeepKey has a solid, metal case.
* The private seed recovery mechanism is highly resistant to key loggers. A key logger gains almost zero information about the private seed during a recovery operation.
* KeepKey comes with a high quality USB cable. Life is too short for crappy USB cables.
* KeepKey can be purchased through Amazon with free 2 day shipping to prime customers in the USA. I just checked: If I order it now, it will arrive on Sunday. YMMV.
* KeepKey offers telephone support.

There was a release of the chrome wallet last week to address an issue where multiple spends in a single session weren't always handled correctly. If you have seen this issue recently, please contact support so that we can get more information. Thanks.

I agree, in principle, but it requires 2 devices.

KeepKey has not prioritized working with Trezor Connect. It is on our todo list, but fairly far down the list because Trezor is working on V2 right now.
We have had our device work with a hacked version of Trezor's code, so we know the KeepKey device is capable. From there it's just good, old-fashioned engineering (and/or possibly some discussion with Trezor) to get it to work.

Nice work, folks. Thank you for sharing it with the rest of us. I was a little baffled at Ledger's strong support for the Bitcoin round table roadmap. Now I understand. 
One question, who is the guy in the picture? is that you?
@_date: 2015-09-23 18:45:00
Thanks for pointing that out. That information has changed. I apologize that we missed it before releasing. It has been removed.
We are working with a third party to FIPS certify the device, but unfortunately, it is a process that takes several months. We decided to go forward with shipping since the core of the code running on KeepKey is well vetted and proven trustworthy by SatoshiLabs.
We will update the FAQ as more data comes in from the FIPS certification process.

First off: I know the head engineers from both companies and trust that their implementations are secure and well considered. I am a software engineer from KeepKey and know that we always put security, usability and privacy first. Ledger, Trezor and KeepKey all have security of your bitcoins as a top priority.
As a comparison of the security features of Ledger and Trezor, here are the things you need to consider:
**Day-to-day use:**
Both products are designed to securely store your private seed in a way that provides tight control of it's use. Ledger has a mobile app that replaces the security card. The security card is only needed to set up the mobile app: bonus points for 2FA built in. Trezor is secured by a PIN that is entered with a rotating keypad. On bad PIN entries, the device will not accept another PIN attempt for an exponentially increasing amount of time. All security is really about making it take a long enough time to break in that it 1) isn't worth it, or 2) you have time to take other security measures. The PIN scheme for Trezor is sufficient to provide a high degree of security.
KeepKey's PIN scheme is identical to Trezor's.
All three products are compatible with third-party wallet software, so will continue to work even if the manufacturer not longer supports it (but you will need to change from myTrezor, myLedger or the KeepKey chrome wallet to something like ethereum).
All three products also provide a execution environment separate from your computer/mobile device that is highly secure. This is probably the most important feature of any security device.
I think the you will find that the three products converge on features and functionality over time. At any given time, one might be ahead of the others on a feature, but all three are actively working on their products and will work toward feature parity (on occasion, we even do so cooperatively).
Initializing the device with a private seed is an important consideration because if done incorrectly, your seed can be compromised from the beginning. Trezor generates the seed on the device using two random number sources. One of the sources is a hardware based true random number generator (TRNG) on the device. It relies on electrical noise from the environment. I don't know the specifics of how this works, but Wikipedia does (
The other random source is the computer/mobile device that the Trezor is attached to. I believe that myTrezor uses the Crypto library in your browser which creates entropy over time, so is also a very good source of random data [ can you confirm this?]. Having two sources of randomness is important because if one source is found to be less random, the other source compensates.
Ledger doesn't generate any entropy on the device itself. It relies on the attached computer/mobile device to provide entropy. Like Trezor, I believe that they use a strong crypto library, so this is probably truly random, but since it is a single source, you don't have the extra insurance that a second source provides.
An additional consideration is that when initializing a Trezor, the private seed is generated on the device and never leaves the device*. With a Ledger, the private seed is generated externally and sent to the device. Assuming the computer being used is compromised, the private seed on the Trezor is still safe, but the private seed on the Ledger is exposed. To mitigate this, Ledger has recently started selling the Ledger Starter ( that provides a secure execution environment for initialization. I don't know much about Ledger Starter, but if  says it is secure, I trust him. If you buy a Ledger, I would consider this a necessity.
KeepKey works the same as the Trezor for initialization with minor differences due to the size of the screens. The KeepKey is able to show your entire private seed on one or two screens, the trezor takes 24 screens to show it.
* Trezor and KeepKey show the private seed generated on initialization on the screen one time for backup.
Recovering your private seed is also an important consideration because if done wrong, your key will be exposed or weakened substantially. Ledger's recovery story is similar to their initialization story. You enter the private seed on the connected computer/mobile device and send it to the device. Again, assuming that your computer is compromised, the private seed is compromised by this approach. I believe that Ledger Starter has a recovery story that mitigates this. I don't know from firsthand experience, but again, I know and trust  so if he says Starter solves this issue, I believe him.
The analysis of Trezor's recovery story is a little more complicated and requires math. When you launch the recovery, the device asks you to enter the 'mnemonic' words that make up your private seed. They are presented in a random order and interspersed with noise words. These approach leaks a lot of information about the seed on a compromised computer. The default Trezor seed is 256 bits long. After one recovery, someone cracking the seed can narrow it down to 48!/24!. That represents a loss of around half of the bits of entropy (it's still a big number, though). After two recoveries of the same key, it's worse because now the noise words can be identified and eliminated. Considering only 24 words, but not knowing the order leaves 24! permutations. This leaves approximately 80 bits of entropy.
80 bits is still uncrackable for all but well funded governments.
KeepKey takes a different approach than Trezor. KeepKey uses a rotating cipher to enter the mnemonic words that represent the private key. ( The only thing the connected computer can see is the number of characters the user enters before the word autocompletes on the screen of the device. The math here is complicated, so I won't go into it, but this information can be used to reduce the combinations by about 11 bits.
The thing that enables KeepKey to use a rotating cypher is the larger screen, which accounts for big part of the price differential. In a sense, the larger screen is a security feature.
Considering the security factors, for day-to-day use all three are solid choices. If you dig into the initialization and recovery, they Ledger and Trezor have issues and KeepKey has built a more secure implementation. Since you ruled out KeepKey based on price, the products I would recommend from a security standpoint are (without preference):
- Trezor
- Ledger Nano with Ledger Starter
If you have been on the fence about buying a hardware wallet, today is a great day. KeepKey, Trezor and Ledger all have Black Friday specials and the price of bitcoin is up.
If I got any of the details wrong here, I hope that  and  will chime in.

KeepKey is alive and well, though we are going through some restructuring, with all the communication and operational challenges that comes along with that. I can't go into the all of the details now, but there will be some announcements soon (good announcements).
Funds stored by your KeepKey or Multibit are safe, there have been no compromises or anything similar.
We do have support responding to requests. If you have requested support for a KeepKey device, there is a good chance that you have already heard from us in the last few days. If you haven't, you should hear from us soon.
I realize this response leaves a lot of questions unanswered. I hope to be able to provide more details soon.
tl;dr - Things are fine, please bear with us for a few weeks as we work through some restructuring.

I heard from the Electrum folks today that it should come out in the next few days. They are working on some really smart features for the BCC fork, so they are motivated to have it released before the end of the month.

It doesn't affect keepkey (the device) other than it allows keepkey (the company) to focus more attention on keepkey (the device).

Yes, in the sense that most people aren't savvy about passwords and have been trained that its ok to forget your password. In the centralized world, its ok because the password can be reset. With BIP39, the funds are lost forever.

I found your ticket in the KeepKey support portal. Based on the information that you provided, we have reviewed every aspect of every transaction in your bitcoin account. **Everything is correct.** The amount that you are claiming as being lost is change and is correctly reflected in your balance. This has been our explanation to you from your first contact with us.
The support rep that you have been working with is contacting another time with a link to blockchain.info that clearly corroborates that bitcoin balance is correct.
The way change works in bitcoin is somewhat unintuitive. We all struggled to wrap our heads around when we were first learning about bitcoin. Please have a look at  for a good explanation of how bitcoin change works.
Your KeepKey has not been hacked and you have not lost bitcoin.

The electrum update is available:  I will update the multibit website to reflect this later today. Thanks to the great team at Electrum.
@_date: 2016-05-17 15:19:08
Thanks A couple of clarifications. The device is capable of supporting passphrases. Always has. If a passphrase is enabled on the device, the chrome extension will support it. (This was added in version 1.0 of the chrome extension). 
Enabling passphrases from the chrome extension is not supported. We consider it an 'expert user' feature, so we have relegated enabling it to the python client. 
In the near future, we will enable BIP39 passphrase, but it will be done in a way that a novice user is less likely to get stuck. 
Edit: Responded with the wrong user reference. Also, removed the paragraph about Electrum because it was wrong. Confused it with myCelium.

You should move your bitcoin to another wallet ASAP because Multibit is no longer supported. See  
There is a small chance that the activation of bitcoin cash will cause technical disruptions. It a good idea to have your bitcoin in a wallet that is actively being supported.

We are working hard to make more KeepKeys. At the moment, I don't have a solid date when they will be back in stock. I apologize the inconvenience. If you contact support we will put you on a list to be notified when more KeepKeys are available.

Any standard micro USB will work. Since it is a standard cable used by old Android phones, it should be easy to pick one up in just about any store. Make sure to buy one that works for data, though. Some cheap ones only carry power.

Actually, it has been 'month and week and days', not 'months and months'. :)
Managing a supply chain is harder than most people would imagine. It has certainly been harder than I imagined.
The most important fact is that every KeepKey continues to function as it always has.

First, I want to apologize on behalf of KeepKey for being out of stock for an extended period. We are working hard at making more KeepKeys. We are also taking steps to better ensure that we don't run out for long periods in the future.
Yes, your seed can be imported into a TREZOR. If you need access to your crypto assets now, that is a very good option. Thanks to the excellent standards known as BIP39 and BIP44 (spearheaded by the folks at SatoshiLabs), most wallets now have compatible recovery and organization of accounts.
As suggested by others, be sure to use the new advanced recovery with your 12 word seed.
The only issue you might have is that myTrezor only supports Bitcoin, Dash and zCash. If you had Litecoin, Dogecoin or Ethereum accounts on your KeepKey, you won't be able to access them from myTrezor.com. They are supported on the TREZOR device, though. As a work-around, the KeepKey Wallet application works with Trezor firmware versions 1.4.x and earlier. You won't get zcash or ethereum support in the KeepKey client, but everything else should work as it did with your KeepKey.
I'm sure that can provide you with other alternatives if you would rather not use the KeepKey Wallet application.
