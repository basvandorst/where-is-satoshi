How did they charge you for that if it wasn't yet Schedule I?

Based on things he wrote on the forums, I don't think laszlo held on to much at all...

That app is terrible. Use CoinCap

Yes, but you don't have to pay back as much as you borrowed.

Eh, I was surprised to read that and went to check for myself. The guy seems quite obsessed with race and believes everyone should vote based on race. I didn't see anything blatantly white *supremacist*, but I did see a lot of stuff very close to white *nationalist* which is hardly better. And I only scrolled back a month

I looked up negative interest rates, it appears that both of these are things that happen. The EU central bank has put negative interest rates on bank accounts in the past, but a number of countries have also given negative interest loans to incentivize spending on projects. It's usually something like -0.1% and you have to make on time payments or the interest becomes slightly positive again. 
Really interesting ideas.

You seem to be misunderstanding the term. White isn't describing the race of the person holding the belief. White Nationalism is a package term. Here's the definition:


As for examples, here are a couple of things he retweeted in the last few days. I'm not going to go further back.

That's why I said he retweeted those. He tweets a decent amount about similar topics, but nothing that makes sense without the context of a handful of other tweets.

As in, they give you a bunch of money and the amount you owe them slowly goes to 0?

You say you don't use twitter. So, do you understand what retweets are? He sees these tweets, decides he wants to share them, so clicks retweet and shows them on his timeline. Then, he goes on to provide vague commentary about what he retweeted. But, it doesn't make sense without the tweet that he retweeted and a handful of his own tweets.
I think you're being difficult at this point. Anyone can go on twitter and look at someone's tweets. You don't have to be "on twitter"
