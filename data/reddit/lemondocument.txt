Right, if one is so certain that bitcoin will crash then luckily it’s possible now to short it.

Except, you know, how you're "forced" to need basic necessities like food, housing, etc. Not everyone has a nice middle class life situation/outlook and a lot of people simply can't make ends meet.

I get the sense a lot of the talking points and discussion there are actively steered by people/bots pushing a pro-bcash anti-bitcoin agenda...
The unison among the point made is just eerie

Right, why do people get so stressed out about this if they're not investing more than they can afford to lose?

Come on you’re just being dense at this point... so bitcoin enthusiasts aren’t allowed to be excited about anything that isn’t perfectly decentralized?
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:29:56
Yeah what happens when these so-called whales try to short bitcoin... and it works briefly.... until it doesn’t work anymore and the price keeps going up.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:41:02
Yes. a perfect example of the classic American conservative world view.

The advantage of a small block size is that, the way it currently is, it (should) always be feasible for an ordinary, not-very-powerful desktop computer to run a full-network validating node. 
The thing that makes bitcoin special is how even some raspberry pi with a satellite internet link in the middle of nowhere Mongolia could operate as a full node. 
At some level of block size increase, the bandwidth and storage required to validate the network and contribute to its security/decentralization will start to move beyond the capabilities of low-end hardware. 
The number of full nodes may decrease and the ones that stay will likely be controlled by people with more wealth/power. Increasing block size is slowly chipping away at decentralization and security.
The negative impact might be negligible for 2mb or 4mb blocks, but it's like a frog in a boiling pot of water type scenario. 
At some point, we might find that it's gone too far and along the way have lost the most important qualities of the technology, the ones that really set it apart from Visa and PayPal (hint: it's NOT the transaction fees.)
My argument against a small "band-aid" block size increase is that it amounts to artificially reducing the economic incentive to develop low-fee layer 2 solutions. 
The high transaction fees can be looked at as paying to have every single bitcoin node download and validate your transaction.
That is HELLA decentralized security that should be worth a lot, and it IS worth a lot, reflected in bitcoin price and transaction fees that people are paying.
It's kind of analogous to a system where each business has a maximum CO2 emissions limit, and when you exceed the limit, you have to pay for the environmental damage caused by the excess.
Increasing the block size would be like increasing the emissions limit. People no longer have to pay as much when they emit a lot of CO2, but the environmental costs wouldn't change. 
It's best to have these costs priced in now so that there is market incentive to find sustainable solutions.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:55:22
Sure, unless it appears like there’s a high-intensity coordinated propaganda campaign trying to flood r/bitcoin which would take over and lead to more people getting sucked in and scammed without the bans.
I’m not arguing that all instances of censorship were warranted just that I can see why heavy moderation is justified in certain circumstances.
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:40:03
This guy thinks 
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:59:52
Yeah, basically. I'd just rather see bitcoin take the more conservative approach while altcoins experiment, as long as the altcoins aren't intentional scams.
If the price of bitcoin needs to drop a lot before LN is implemented, so be it. It won't die. A smaller bitcoin network might make it easier to roll out second layer solutions and should hopefully be less congested.
If the final product really works (low fees) and stays decentralized, then I believe it will come out ahead of any more-centralized altcoin in the end.

"Consensus" is just the dynamic equilibrium between all the players in the bitcoin ecosystem.
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:51:26
That’s not cash then that’s Venmo, western union, greendot, paypal, bank transfer, Visa, ACH, etc.
That’s not cash at all, thats institutions shuffling data around.
Give me ONE example that does not require trusting a third party aside from traveling to the other side of the planet yourself with cash in hand.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:38:26
Yeah, it’s encouraging (discouraging?) to see that most of the general public that’s heard of it still thinks it’s this bizarre computer nerd thing that is t actually real.
They don’t understand yet so there’s still time to buy.

Not sure if trolling?
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:47:35
I think the animosity has to do with the common belief on this subreddit that bcash is an intentional scam rather than simply the fact that it is an altcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:01:16
Right, its hard not to get sucked in when I see such poorly researched beliefs. I'll try though.

Bitcoin also isn’t a company
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:19:29
And THIS is exactly the sort of civil, reasonable comment that leads to the poster feeling unfairly abused if they get banned. Let's try to be nice!
I agree with some small portion of what you're saying. 
I think there's a long-shot chance of a scenario where bitcoin might go through some "long dark winter" again IF a low-fee coin really takes hold and becomes widely used as transactional currency before bitcoin network congestion is solved.
Eventually, even if it takes a couple years, the altcoin will get dragged down by issues related to improper scaling and bitcoin will take first place again.
However, I don't think this scenario would even come close to killing bitcoin, and I still think declining to increase the block size is the right move long-term.
P.S. I would love to discuss the pros and cons of block size increase and waiting for LN.
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:11:04
Yeah I agree, I'm just pointing out why people here are upset about him and the whole bcash business. 
Who knows, maybe he truly believes that bitcoin cash is the future (doubtful) and he's not just trying to leverage a scamcoin + propaganda campaign to make a quick buck.
I still think it's perfectly ok to apply non-binding moral standards to people. 
Just because someone owns crypto doesn't mean typical norms of decent human conduct should go out the window.

Right, my comment is meant to convey that there are some people (myself) who did understand those things but did not get into bitcoin for other reasons.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:17:40
Right, whenever I hear bitcoin coming up in any “normal” conversations in real life, it’s always someone poking fun at it who thinks it isn’t real.
This means that we are still in the way early stages of adoption and have a long way to go.
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:32:36
Or it’s because they were poor, or straight up forgot about bitcoin...

But it’s NOT miners shuffling data around. It’s nodes. Check out the bitcoin protocol! It’s actually pretty cool.
You don’t have to trust any of the nodes, just the entire network collectively.
That is radically different than any Venmo or Visa.

People can scream about transaction fees all they want but when bitcoin continues to get bought up despite those fees you can't really call it failure just because it's not competing with venmo...
