all exchanges keep their own books and it's up to the users and the bots etc to level out the prices. This is how the stock market works too. Those that make money or try to make money on arbitrage keep prices synced with trading bots. Coinbase must take an average of what they consider the 'best' exchanges.

all exchanges have fees like this, not just for bitcoin. cost of facilitating your stuff. most places even charge fees for storing your funds and managing it taking a piece of the pie every day, not just when you trade or withdraw.
it's unavoidable
@_date: 2019-08-11 02:18:04
google says 15k too? 
@_date: 2019-08-11 04:56:50
what is this?
@_date: 2019-08-19 22:03:43
i think i already did, trying to get neck deep into btc before it's too late.
@_date: 2019-08-13 16:17:46
yes of course, and people will never land on the moon and people will never fly
@_date: 2019-08-19 23:32:32
@_date: 2019-08-11 02:10:03
one, about 15k worth
@_date: 2019-08-16 15:38:06
So....... what does this mean ?
@_date: 2019-08-16 05:10:55
authy stores your data in the cloud, i think you need to download it and unloack it with a pw ( or reset 2fa... i think you need to contact support for that )
@_date: 2019-08-12 15:50:43
quantum coupling would be like the 'ansible' from ender's game series and would solve this problem and so many more.... i don't think we can count on that as a solution though as far as i know only a few km works so far and even then not that well?
@_date: 2019-08-11 07:22:53
someone shared this with me earlier today, its pretty great [
now to figure what i want
@_date: 2019-08-11 04:58:23
I was told this is the 21 million club
why is that shameful?
@_date: 2019-08-19 19:26:18
maybe it IS Roger Ver. he has a history of turning his back on those that he supported rather abruptly after all.
lol did you guys see that he doxed some poor guy over $30 and it seems like it was a problem wit hhis platform and the guy didn't even do anything wrong?
@_date: 2019-08-11 02:56:47
its a bit of a pain but i got a longer usb cable and it's better
@_date: 2019-08-14 18:32:42
are they legit??? They want my bank creds ( login id and pw! ) seems very..... untrustworthy
@_date: 2019-08-11 07:01:15
it would be great if ticket master took bitcoin
what do you use it for?
@_date: 2019-08-22 22:08:11
lol i tried to tip my hair dresser in btc but her nails were too long to operate her phone properly, she didn't know her play store pw.... it was pretty difficult.... the older generation is def going to need help with cryptos.
\*Ended up giving her cash

1. Send funds to lightning enabled wallet ( wait for 2 confirms ) bitcoin lightning on android is what i used
2. open lightning channel 
3. opena another lightning channel
4. wait for them to confirm
5. start spending
@_date: 2019-08-15 16:08:18
Get an account on an exchange ! the auth takes forever, like a month, and banks are a pain
@_date: 2019-08-16 15:21:26
you guys are kinda dicks
why are yo usu freaking judgemental he is obviously happy with his tat you don't gotta poop all over him for it... you could just say nothing

if i was on the mars colony i don't think i'd want to trust earth miners for everything
what kind of problems would very long block times cause ? very curious about this aspect
@_date: 2019-08-15 02:36:15
my bro took out sooooo fucking much with no problems at all, i'm talking hundreds of thousands, he used stamp. now he has another house.  that guy is way ahead of the curve.
@_date: 2019-08-16 02:14:38
That looks really slick.  How warm does it get in there?
what miners are those? How much btc does it mine per day?
@_date: 2019-08-17 01:04:46
I would say... all of it.  If someone HODLs they are buying it themselves.
@_date: 2019-08-20 00:08:16
buy as much as you can
@_date: 2019-08-16 15:16:37
i did ! i'm up $4
also down about $1500 from my first purchase a week ago but im sure that will reverse itself in the next few years
@_date: 2019-08-15 00:56:41
thanks, never heard of this before setting up now !!
@_date: 2019-08-20 19:57:22
so it is Roger Ver ?
@_date: 2019-08-16 15:07:44
for me it was the volatility, kept me away way too long
@_date: 2019-08-21 23:07:44
i'd say it's the first time we've accomplished 'acounting' 
it really is quite astounding how this doesn't click with more accountants and business owners. Maybe part of it is because the idea of a public immutable record isn't something they really want? Better to be able to fudge numbers?
@_date: 2019-08-14 22:17:29
what happens if you remove the genesis blocks and exchanges from the equation?
@_date: 2019-08-15 23:34:21
this is great! i'm working up to this step soon!!!  Anything tricky about it??
@_date: 2019-08-16 15:18:04
what exactly is that?
@_date: 2019-08-11 02:13:45
i was reading a book that was talking about that. rich bitch. it was ok but i couldn't finish the book boring as meh.
i think i will get more but first i want to play around a bit to see what it's all about.
@_date: 2019-08-25 03:12:43


any insurance companies cover crypto?
@_date: 2019-08-14 14:50:24
seems kind of rude and a great way to get people to drop bitcoin alltogether
@_date: 2019-08-21 04:44:56
that didn't age so well
@_date: 2019-08-11 02:55:58
what do you mean
@_date: 2019-08-12 16:04:13
i would have epxected this response in taht other sub i'm just asking questions trying to find solutions to what matters to me no need to get all testy
@_date: 2019-08-14 21:08:03
what did you do?
@_date: 2019-08-23 04:03:57
Bitcoin and friends is fantastic
@_date: 2019-08-11 02:59:21
what do you mean, because of the longer cable?
@_date: 2019-08-12 19:53:46
mars is 3 mins at closest and i think 16 mins at the furthest ( depending on the relative orbits of earth and mars ) approx twice the distance from the earth to the sun
@_date: 2019-08-14 21:07:48
i started using mycelium on my phone for the daily 'carry around with me coins'

Crazy brave, how much did it hurt?
in 10 years when your stash is up 1000x will you get another? 
ive been wanting a tat for years but im pretty much too chicken to try and keep changing my mind on what i want.
@_date: 2019-08-31 00:48:23
I got some too, dip tastes better when shard!
@_date: 2019-08-27 19:39:34
what the F.......... send these to me instead? I will HODL i promise
@_date: 2019-08-14 22:17:48
@_date: 2019-08-13 16:16:34
where did you read that?
@_date: 2019-08-11 02:27:10
not sure what you mean
@_date: 2019-08-14 03:22:06
the way it's been explained to me is it's basically yhatzee, bunch of computers trying to get 6's on all of dice. First one to do it gets to make the block and collect the reward.
Mining pool works the same way, but to make sure you are doing the work the mining pool will expect you to get 6's on say 3/4 of the dice every once in a while while trying to 6's on all of the dice, the more frequently you get 3/4 of the dice as 6's the higher the mining pool weights your work.
Obviously it's not dice, the dice are used to represent the random nature of the sha256 algorithm.  the results are unknown, but reproducable with the same inputs.
And so that you can't "work ahead" a signature from the "LAST BLOCK" must be included in this block.
@_date: 2019-08-11 02:26:56
got  it on my treznor
@_date: 2019-08-17 01:04:06
how do you know that? can you show me?
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:50:27
never heard of newton, thanks for the tip
@_date: 2019-08-13 17:26:46
my bro bgouth me a trezor to get me started on my journy, this might be better as a gift? I like it more because it got me off the sidelines
@_date: 2019-08-15 23:47:48
that sounds elite !
@_date: 2019-08-16 15:43:31
how does one validate this?
@_date: 2019-08-13 18:02:20
reitring seems boring
my plan is to use the profits to build up a fashion design empire ! or... at least a nice little botique
@_date: 2019-08-11 03:00:16
@_date: 2019-08-19 21:08:03
at least judas got silver
this guy is getting bcash
@_date: 2019-08-19 14:46:28
I joined r/btc first not knowing about r/bitcoin.... it was a weird experience.  Eventually someone posted a 'newbs messagea bout r/bitcoin' and found my way here! thankfully! It's a weird place overall.
@_date: 2019-08-19 16:02:56
Never thought of this before, but kenny is like bitcoin, always dieing

@_date: 2019-08-16 16:34:18
what stops banks from treating btc like gold and start to fractionally reserve it?
this part troubles me.
@_date: 2019-08-20 00:05:44
if it is roger ver can we nail him to a cross?
@_date: 2019-08-11 02:58:05
pretty sure cnbc said 10% of amercians are into bitcoin already
@_date: 2019-08-12 15:54:44
would that be so bad?  Send a transaction for 3000 tonnes of potatoes to earth.. transaction time 1 month.... transport time 1 year....
@_date: 2019-08-11 19:03:03
i'm not using my real name
mrs slappy fist would be a weird fun name though
@_date: 2019-08-13 17:43:51
for me it was because the world markets are looking like a complete mess and my bro has been showing me how he's been doing with his crypto investments 
i guess it's a hedge? but it's also something more. the idea of money that 'just works' anywhere without any banks is pretty great.... i'm super curious about how commerce in space could be done and I think bitcoin could work but trying to learn more
@_date: 2019-08-13 18:54:42
what was it like meeting roger ver before he went off the deep end?
@_date: 2019-08-16 05:11:37
i can't wait for this
this is why i bought bitcoin
@_date: 2019-08-11 07:09:19
sorry, couldn't resist
@_date: 2019-08-11 05:00:38
kind of feels like you can't afford not to.
@_date: 2019-08-13 17:05:46
you're trying pretty hard 
anyhow, easy solution is to have a relay station in orbit
@_date: 2019-08-13 16:35:54
you post again when you can back up your statements with a simple reference
@_date: 2019-08-20 22:26:02
Coincidence? I think not ! [
@_date: 2019-08-14 21:09:41
good job, i bought a whole btc 6 days ago and now wish i waited a bit longer or at least bought a bit at a time like some haad metnioned here
waiting to fund my account to buy a bit mroe now, hopefully tomorrow
@_date: 2019-08-11 19:03:48
what? why?
@_date: 2019-08-11 02:27:57
well see so far its neat but not star trek neat like i was promised
@_date: 2019-08-14 14:31:25
this is the kind of stuff i was looking for...... but I don't understand what you mean.
what is fee sniping?
