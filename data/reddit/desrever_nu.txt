NuBits fixes volatility in a decentralised manner, instead of relaying on a website managed by a private company.. Its price has been 1$ for the last two months (check it) . It separates the speculative assets (shares) from the unit of account (bits) , and manages an elastic supply through a distributed voting poll in the blockchain. Take a look

I enjoyed reading their new announcement and the angle they used to present their choices.
PS: Thanks for the tip, didn't see it much on this sub!

hi, here des, from nu, and I agree with you. 
Pegging to the dollar was the first choice that made sense for a decentralised experiment never attempted before.  Picking the world most used currency was no-brainer for a start.   
Concept of absolute stability does not exist in nature. Now we can look at other solutions for next pegs : inflation-adjusted dollars, basket of currencies, basket of goods, financial indexes...
Anyway, so far so good (115 days in)  (should update it after yesterdays events)
Come join the discussion if you are interested

"Once the velocity of money increases a clear winner will stand up. Right now there is no contender to Bitcoin." 
At the moment NuBits feature the highest market velocity and stable price (1$) with trading volume in the top 5 almost everyday .
People can get paid in NuBits, make loans, tip,  bet and do all the things they do with normal money without having to deal with awful fluctuation (both ways).  The pegging mechanism is distributed in the blockchain using share tokens to vote, as opposed to the unit of account (bits) .  One minute block time makes them way faster than bitcoin.
Thanks to mobile wallets like coinomi and services like shapeshift, you can use them to pay everywhere Bitcoin is accepted. You can speculate on the value of the network by buying shares (up 5x organically from the day of release).
I started with bitcoin in 2009, now there is no reason to be foolish and blind.

Relevant : On  (discourse) a tipping bot has been implemented.
 tip [amount]  Send a tip of [amount] NBT to 
For reference see the documentation :  (yep, it does a bit more than just tipping)
Moreover, being NuBits always 1 $, its easy to specify amounts (forget about 0.00235 BTC ) .
