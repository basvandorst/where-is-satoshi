In a merchant context, a ~$160 Nexus 7 with Coinbase merchant app works perfectly.

Ripple is Google-backed and none of Circle's investors hail from, or are involved with, Google. I'd be surprised if Circle gets behind Ripple.

This is the direct link to the RSVP page for the Budweiser Made in America Concert in Salt Lake City, Utah featuring Cash Cash and Viceroy. Free to attend and receive $10 worth of free bitcoin to spend anywhere bitcoin is accepted.

Yep! But Budweiser is still Made in America.

How are there so many comments on here from people who don't know how this works? This is a Lamassu bitcoin vending machine which retails for $5K. You need a money transmitter license to serve the public or the fed will ruin you like they did Shrem. USD in BTC out. Simple. Likely interfaces with an exchange. Vending machine owners tack a % fee on top.

Why do I need an $800 POS terminal when I can just use my smartphone?

I'm thinking that Apple first wanted to restrict a payment mechanism they didn't fully understand. Now that they understand it, and realize how much value it can add, I think they may be including this as one of several rails, in addition to VISA/MasterCard payment options.

The Bitcoin Foundation, A group of people who fancy themselves as the voice of bitcoin, is a command and control architecture that is the antithesis of what bitcoin stands for. Legends like [Andreas Antonopoulos]( are all we need -- people who are so passionate about the protocol's potential that they can't help but speak out and carry the torch.

No gifting of bitcoin this time. Just making it possible to buy Budweiser with bitcoin.

I've never received tipped bits. How does one collect?
@_date: 2014-05-09 16:29:43
FYI BashCo give me my first tipped bits yesterday. Good on you, sir.

The old parent company was called NFC Direct so I'm assuming [Circle]( will try to use NFC to transact bitcoin. Hopefully they see that bluetooth LE is a better choice.

Thanks BashCo! 7 Years... hard to believe.

Also $20K-$30K saved in credit card transaction fees

Yep. I'm 100% verified including CC backup. I purchased 5 and then sent about a minute afterward. The send is still pending after five hours. I've already contacted support twice. Nothing yet.

I bet they're thinking m-pesa... but what if they thought bitcoin instead? Didn't m-pesa integrate bitcoin?

The point of the question was to illuminate the not-so-anonymous-ways in which Coinbase operates. I'm surprised they would show me the depositor's name.

I purchased 5 BTC this morning around 8 EST and my purchase is still pending though I did not receive the "we're out of bitcoins" notification. If I dive into the transaction details it says that the BTC will not be in my account until Friday. This is horse sh*t. I've begun to open accounts with other exchanges... something I should've done a while ago.

Agreed... Zazzle is stupid. Waiting for Shopify to release its btc integration.
