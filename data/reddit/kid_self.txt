Was recommended by a friend. Been using them for about 9 months now and never had a problem until this incident. 
My fault for not doing my homework. I'll accept as much. Lesson learned, and I hope others can take something from my experience.

Hi. Yes. Updated OP.

This is probably the most honest information I've received about this issue. Why not tell us this in the first place, instead of empty, indeterminant statements about how "soon" it will be resolved. 
On a related note, thank you for your email reply. I can understand it will take some additional time to put the funds back into my bank account, but I'd rather it happen sooner than later.
I've taken other people's advice from this thread and will action this case with higher authorities should my funds not be released within a reasonable timeframe. Reasonable being your standard 1-2 days for a transfer to occur. 
This case has thrown out my personal budget like you wouldn't believe. I had to still cover my original payment, as well as being out of pocket ~$600. This is not a laughable amount for me, and the reason for the payment was very important, so I had no choice in the matter.

Thanks for your reply. I just signed up on Coinjar a few days ago and it's excellent.

Did you even read my OP? I've tried to resolve it multiple ways with them directly, and had more than one promise broken by them.
