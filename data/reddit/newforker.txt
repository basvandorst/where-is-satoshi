Fuck yes, if at 16 you are being to understand the impact of bitcoin and more importantly blockchain technology you are way ahead. Fuck, for all we know btc goes to 0 tomorrow and we all bite the bell like pikers. Fine, so be it, but at least, at your age, you know what the future holds whilst most of your peers will be pissing away time on the facebook, instagram et al. I was mentioning this to a colleague of mine earlier today, we literally have the world at our finger tips, but most of us choose to waste it on garbage Jerry Springfield levels of white noise. Anywho, fuck it all man..goes balls to the wall man.

In the grand scheme of things I think the crypto community is still fairly small. Some people will lose money. But nobody who does will be bailed out or cause a recession.
