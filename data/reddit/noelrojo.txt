haha, i spilled my tea because of that title. It speaks the truth though. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 19:17:07
Wow. Such troll. No life. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 02:48:42
haha, i spilled my coffee when i read that.

The Boss of Bitcoin, hehehe

This is a dick move @_date: 2014-06-14 02:18:07
This is awesome. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 02:25:29
There is one being developed, it uses Dogecoin though. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:07:19
Not sure where you are getting that information from, this states otherwise.
@_date: 2014-04-07 08:41:32
That's sad that people are spreading false accusations just like that. Do you have a source for any of this? 
@_date: 2014-02-09 09:15:32
Not really, i'm pretty sure that phrase actually started in Bitcoin ;). It's pretty much used by all crypto currencies. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 19:48:21
Dogecoin, about 50k+ people buying Bitcoins to exchange for Dogecoin and vice versa. Don't hate, they are spreading the word about crypto-currencies and in the end benefiting Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 02:28:41
Dogecoin official currency of Facebook and Twitter. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:53:55
Hence the reason for the down voting on good posts like this.
@_date: 2014-03-17 17:06:15
The Dogetipbot creator is currently working with Twitch to integrate a Dogecoin [* tipbot *]( This will probably be down voted but there is a huge demand out there for tipping.

Brilliant guys. Makes me glad i discovered Dogecoin. Thought me a lot about crypto currencies so now i own some Bitcoins too. He's evaluation of Bitcoin in comparison to Paypal makes quite a bit of sense, making Bitcoin undervalued. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 01:53:55
This is neat. "Good for one free lunch", this is the type of satire Bitcoin needs haha. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 23:53:25
I think the Dogecoin dev team will continue to take it to the moon. Dogecoin now has a light wallet. 
PS. I think is time to see it as more than a Joke, people are really trying to make it work. Also Dogecoin gives crypto currencies a good name, with all the charity that it's doing. We are all in this together. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 09:34:24
Not bad bought low, bought high and i keep on buying. The Dogetipbot dev is good friend's with the Twitch.tv owners and they are working on a tipbot there, plenty of untouched potential there. For a 3 month old currency i think it's doing great. There's some depreciation lately due to the multi pools dumping it all for BTC but that's good in my opinion, It is allowing for new money to buy in while it's cheap. The amount of dogellionares has gone up by almost 10% in the last couple of days due to that, which means there is still lots of buying power behind it and doge is being distributed instead of being hoarded by a few percentage of people (Wealth distribution is still not that good though). At the moment, i think it will continue to be really cheap, there is just too much of it being dumped by multi pools. We will see how it fares after a few more halvings.

The only true source of knowledge is The Bible, all other sources of knowledge are written by demons. 
Edit: Bitcoin=mark of the beast, Wikipedia= written by demons. Coincidence? I think not.

This was done by Dogecoin, but the same can be said for Bitcoin.
Dogecoin helped raise 30 thousand dollars (with dogecoins) for the Jamaican bobsled team, it cost fractions of pennies for the transactions to be processed. Most donations where around a dollar’s worth of Dogecoin from all over the globe, It would have cost at least $7,500 if it would have been done using Paypal. Paypal is charging fees of 30cents + 2.9% per transaction even if the item is costing less than a dollar. Those are the rates on average, however if you want to donate from overseas the prices are substantially higher

Yep, the fight part is happening now haha. Wouldn't have thought about that a few weeks back.

Nicely said, i bough another Bitcoin and a few million Doge in this panic. I believe in this technology and the developments that are on the works for it.

You should put a question mark on the back picture, make it seem like the enigma that is Satoshi Nakamoto

Thanks man, It seems they don't like us here though :(

It has always been a dream of mine to create a TCG game, the other day i was thinking about what you wrote. A Device similar to [Trezor]( with a screen could make for cool character that could level up as you fight them without cheating haha. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 22:20:06
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:29:52
Yep, the same applies to Multidoge, you can't transfer large amounts for some reason.

I'm pretty sure he will state he's cause. I just hope this mob mentality won't blow things out of proportion.

Holy guacamole, look at the shiny circle things all over here.

Seriously, I'm beginning to hate China. Is this how they operate in all their business? Is like they have no honor. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 02:58:54
I heard about it through Dogecoin
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:30:10
Just a troll, ignore. Unfortunately new technologies come with many risks, stay strong. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 01:54:35
There is one being created, however it will use Dogecoin. Im sure they can integrate Bitcoin as well. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 03:42:52
Ugh, seriously this freeee guy is annoying 
@_date: 2014-02-22 22:17:17
Yeah, i know. Maybe some bitcoin dev would appreciate it though.

Well, thank you kindly sir :). My first Btc tip.

No, they have been really transparent since the beginning.

This micro payments and how easy they are done is what gives cryptos their strength, along with many other things. This is why i think crypto currencies are here to stay. “You can’t un-invent innovation” Andreas A.

It seems like a lot of this smaller exchanges have been experiencing DDoS lately, Moolah.io was also down for a few minutes last night. However they posted on their tweeter that they where experiencing and ongoing DDoS attack.
