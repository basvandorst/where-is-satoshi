You've got your pk, you double checked the receiving address and you are transferring to an app that I can confirm as buggy. You'll be fine. Have you reset the cache? Check that this is the appropriate thing to do through your own research but this helped me, although it was not an instant fix and took a few hours.

They talked about bitcoin in a non-positive light. That asshat zero knowledge 12 grader. Does he not realise we have money invested here?!! We dont need common sense, we need pumps and memes. GTFO with that shit bring back vegeta.

Unsure if this helps but I had a lot of problems with jaxx showing incorrect balances or just plain 0. Ended up losing faith in it after one too many scares and would not advise anyone to go near it.

Great news dude welcome back to the club!

Hard wallets like trezor are the only way to be sure you are protected I would use this and do. Although to be honest I'd choose keeping them in, for example, coinbase over jaxx. For obvious reasons this isn't the right advice to give but i'd choose it over storing my funds on some random app that claims security but has no customer support like jaxx. If that fucks up and you lose funds where do you go?

Cool, I have used Electrum for some small amounts of certain Alts and never had a issue, so I would agree this is a great choice. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:28:07
Yeah let us know how you get on. When my balance went to zero the first time I lost my shit so I feel your pain. First thing I did once I recovered it was move everything out of jaxx.

The amount of times. Do what I do - take your budget you were going to put into this (let's say 1k). Take 10% and buy now. Dont think about timing anything, don't think about the negative press or anything else. Just buy with a tiny amount. Watch what happens to it pricewise every now and then. When your ready jump in with more.

"Then rumours surfaced they (china) could ban bitcoin exchanges. This rumour came to nothing, but clearly spooked a lot of participants" 
Am I missing something? This technical analysis seems based on poorly researched fundamentals.

You can think what you like about the news and how overrated it is. The market will make it's own decision on the data regardless. I think everyone should prepare for sub 3k at least. It's not unbelievable to imagine, it happened a week ago. Retest on the bottom is on the cards.

Why can't it be called btc sorry?

We're going to $2.6k before recovery. You heard it here

Coinbase said they support 2x. So what if they use btc as the ticker for btc2x? I'm not asking like I know, I genuinely don't. I'm looking for someone who does know to tell me what happens in that situation

 Hodl sounds great when the dips last hours lol. When you lose thousands hodl suddenly becomes a very real decision. Maybe the amount of new investors had no idea what they were getting into and got spooked. The amount of new people asking questions that really a simple Google search would bring up says people believed they were in on this thing that was going to turn couple hundred fiat into billions. You know your in a shit show when 15 yr olds are asking for help navigating around checks put in place to protect people. Honestly this clear out is a great thing. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:23:34
Why does it matter what's already happened. From my understanding most exchanges push 2x, so they can call it what they want no?
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:36:30
Surely the news wasn't just that exchanges would be banned, but that they would halt fiat / btc pairs. This article doesn't reference this. Exchanges could be becoming otc only. So still nothing new here?

If anyone can give me a good reason why not I'd love to hear it. Why does anyone care anyway? I hold, and if love to see $2.6k. People are just overexposed financially.
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:05:59
I guess my point is that 'exchange x' supports 2x. They want bitcoin core out as I understand it, so it's in their interest to push btc as the ticker for bitcoin 2x no? Thanks for the honest discussion rather than butthurt comments, misinformation and downvotes.. clearly a contentious qsubject here..
@_date: 2017-10-01 17:20:10
I'm invested across several cryptos. Do everything by the book don't keep in exchanges etc etc. I also read a great deal but this all seems like madness and a real shame. The level of knowledge required to safely navigate this space is enough of a barrier to entry for most folk without this shit on top. Makes it even harder when your own community downvotes for asking difficult questions. Fishy indeed. Thanks for the info.

Genuine guy that took a lot of shit just to tried to get the news to the masses asap. So many people get way too emotional about btc and take it out on the messenger
