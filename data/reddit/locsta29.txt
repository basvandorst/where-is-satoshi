Scalability is also an issue with Lightning Network even the devs behind it says so.
You can find post here on Reddit about it.

At best it could become an etalon.
I don’t know how bitcoin can overcome ALL of the following: fees, scalability, energy consumption.

You know that to open a lightning network channel you are going to have to pay a transaction fee right?
So what happen is let’s say Bitcoin is worth 200K$ in a few years. Do you think people are going to pay 200$ to open a channel on the lightning network?

I think you are completely delusional.
Lightning network seems good on paper, but in reality it’s very different. Even the devs says it will have troubles scaling... 
You will have no problems finding articles on this topic.
Energy consumption is least problematic problem right now for bitcoin but it will always get bigger, if bitcoin gains adoption this price will rise, so the mining pool will get bigger as well, so more energy consumption, huge computational processing power being wasted as well...
Let’s give time to bitcoin and see if those problems get fixed.

I feel like trying to scale bitcoin at this point is similar to try tunning an old car to make it fly.
I rather build a rocket if I want to reach the moon.

It's doing just that at the moment

Couldn't be a worst timing to post this lol

This is like asking to your friend how he likes the view when you are on the titanic and the boat is sinking

Yea like the banking system is run by communists...

I'm not sure if you are ironic or not.
If you are you probably don't know how IOTA works.
It's not a blockchain, it doesn't have miners, and the bigger the network is the faster it gets

IOTA could serve as the currency for everyday payments as it's feeless, fast and scalable !!
