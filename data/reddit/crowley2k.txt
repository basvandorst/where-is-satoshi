interesting idea..i can see a demand for this kind of thing..
@_date: 2016-04-17 09:22:37
i don't think its 'legit' ,but in any case is not anonymous nor will you find any 'legit' one that is..
but for what do you need an escrow?for a product or a service?
@_date: 2016-04-24 07:30:17
because they do comply with bip44 standard,which only allows +1 unused private key/account
@_date: 2016-04-06 08:00:56
he's not..he's just being appropriate for the question you asked..
you can't tell if the buyer used the code on his account or other of which he owns or resell it
you can't tell if the seller actually gave them a working code..
@_date: 2016-04-17 09:11:47
shipping costs are low(most scenarios ..) but the custom taxes...that's what gonna ruin your definition of 'cheap' 
in the end...its better off to buy from your country,plus there's no risk of not getting your product or realizing the amount you'll have to pay for the taxes is worth more than the product itself ...
^ if that does happen a moderator might rule in the favour of the buyer in which case he's gonna get his money back and you may be the one left to pay the taxes,depends on the country involved ..

mycelium with tor(orbot app) and export xprv to electrum that will only use tor nodes..
@_date: 2016-04-24 05:38:48
you can't in the app, however you can export the xpub key to obtain more (electrum or other scripts)
however keep in mind that the wallet will not check ahead to see if other addresses are used or not so you will have to fill them up eventually..
@_date: 2016-04-19 06:23:19
as for the 5% usually is,since a terminal will be 8-10% higher
but don't use skill,trade in person..
@_date: 2016-04-17 10:46:10
if you do have a site or something similar...just use electrum or copay for a 2 of 3 multisig(buyer,seller,escrow)
if need help..contact me..

you can increase your electricity bill
you can gain experience of general mining
you can damage your pc over time
what you can't do is gain profit from mining with your pc,you need expensive hardware,cheap electricity,low temperature area
@_date: 2016-04-24 06:14:50
they also need to pay the electricity bills and some other things,having better equipment might be more profitable on the long run...up for them to make a decision ..
@_date: 2016-04-06 18:53:31
how would that solve the problem?
most likely will only increase the losses for the buyer..
the only real solution is not trading what you can not generate proof
@_date: 2016-04-24 14:53:28
pretty much that ;)
@_date: 2016-04-24 07:41:14
first account,first address ;you have send money to it in order to generate another address and another account ,that's how it will work
in your case you can generate those 3 address quick with electrum and then after address 2 will be used you can use the funds from address 3 because it won't check its ballance otherwise
you can also import these 2 additional addresses if by any reasons not all of them will be used(as in other will not sends funds towards those sites..)

localbitcoins , mycelium local trader
those do not require paper but doesn't guarantee you find someone willing to trade with you in the city you live in..
@_date: 2016-04-20 08:00:14
assuming you can't withdraw your funds,how much was 'locked' in?
@_date: 2016-04-19 06:02:03
coinbase is not a bitcoin wallet,its an exchange that deals with fiat and bitcoin,so...yeah..they do have to uphold the law when it comes to fiat and its regulations..
at your age you either have to ask your parents to buy from them or buy locally,choose a public place for the meeting even more because your a kid..
@_date: 2016-04-19 06:46:57
it's a lot easier to do that online.. he can take the money back even after he gave it.. after 1 day or 6 months
theres lower risk of doing it in person as i said
@_date: 2016-04-19 06:08:10


its an exchange...they hold it for you!


i don't really have that option here(in my country)only terminals that sells bitcoin at a higher price,so coinbase can be used to make a little profit on the margin ;)
@_date: 2016-04-19 06:16:28


let's just say there's a reason in person trades are advisable..
@_date: 2015-12-29 12:06:42
you will take an unnecessary risk,it might be the day you made the exchange or six months later due to a charge back when you lose both the bitcoins and the money of which you will have to pay back to Paypal willingly or not 
my suggestion:put the money in an exchange or sell them locally for cash and then transfer from your bank account to paypal
^ safest way
@_date: 2015-12-31 09:44:11
there are none and will never be
its not only about the storage place required but a node will have to verify everything received so it will use a lot of power,power that you won't have for long,@ 1-3 h
@_date: 2015-12-14 09:32:32
its not a private key..
@_date: 2015-12-30 19:22:05
you can reuse the address ,just that aint advised
@_date: 2015-12-29 23:00:22
1. it will probably be replaced by another similar concept 
2. latency,earth won't be able to sustain our specie like today and bitcoin can't work for more than one planet,ergo altcoins
either way,if we come to think about it you will find out a couple more million reasons before we ever reach that point of value ,so..its pointless to explore this futher
@_date: 2015-12-22 07:47:47
i guess the only thing missed from above comments is "security",the kind of network hash rate that separates bitcoin from all other altcoins
So..yeah.. 'Security' and 'Trust'(as in knowing that the user actually have bought $100 and not actually appear out of thin air since will be private) is something an altcoin will not encourage users to buy it

Fees	0.00000558 BTC
well..not surprising ..
@_date: 2015-12-29 08:25:52
your wallet does not support signing a message,it can not be imported in other wallet so your only choice is to transfer it to another
my suggestion is electrum,since you probably want a wallet that doesnt use a lot of resouces(pc) and one that has more features and can be used on phone too
@_date: 2015-12-17 10:50:25
maybe just import the address in other wallet and try to spend it
possible the transaction just got deleted from memory pool and your wallet didnt resend it..
just try at this point..its not like you have other options ;)
@_date: 2015-12-16 12:07:25


a lawyer from your country will be a better choice than asking this on reddit


since you pay more on fiat transaction fees you may as well just do that and a discount attracts more customers,you'l recover it quite fast the profits

mycelium,bitcoin wallet by schildbach(not working in this version)
just go with the first ;)
@_date: 2015-06-07 07:14:15
thanks for comparing oil with water..
openbazaar is not meant for currency exchange,but for trading goods most of which can not be checked if the buyer received them or not and in what condition,so there's a bit **leap of fate** there..
localbitcoins should only be used for **cash/in person trading** and not anything else or you will be in same troubles as with openbazaar
circle,coinbase "wallets" are used to **buy** bitcoins **online**
coinbase exchange is used to **trade** bitcoins **online**
@_date: 2015-06-15 05:20:12
if you do so,you may also import the xprv keys generated with the old seed after you make a new one(wallet/seed)
because you never know if someone will send btc to your old addresses ..
@_date: 2015-12-30 23:32:51
for donation no,for payments yes and no,things get a little more complicated as in the person doesnt know who bought what and for what amount,if they paid or not,etc..
you need a real POS,so a wallet such as copay is not enough
easiest way to do it(alone,not hiring a company/developer) is to use bip121(Proof of Payment)
@_date: 2015-12-31 12:37:09
and probably even faster than everything nasa send into space,that doesnt mean will ever get "out there"
sorry for the sarcasm but you can't really compare a phone with a desktop build
as for the feature you have a very wrong idea about the bitcoin,the number of devices that can run a full node will decrease and not increase,it will follow the trend we have seen so far
more ram so that transactions will be kept longer in the memory pool before they are verified,more storage(3-5 tx per second ain't gonna be enough for mass adoption),more cpu for..pretty much everything and the amount of bandwith just to keep it updated..oh well..we can only imagine what are the requirements for 7 bill peoples or more...
a full node on a tinny battery? dont think so..
@_date: 2015-12-09 16:14:01
let's see..because he has a big chunk of bitcoins mined when all 'this' started and his actions can still have a big impact on the currency if he ever decided to use those
@_date: 2015-06-21 11:21:49
something like that will not exist for bitcoin
sure..you can find something similar,like for example using a multisignature address where you will sign a transaction and the other party,a company ,will sign a transaction only if its under X amount of bitcoin(greenadress have done that,maybe others too)
however that will not stop someone from stealing your bitcoins if they access both your device and their server(i.e greenadress server)
so..what are the better options?
BIP38(better used with android device(mycelium) or another offline device for signing),offline multisignature transaction signing,..
@_date: 2015-06-28 06:09:37
as you already know..the price has been quite stable these last couple of months,ranging from 210 to 260 and in march to 300
you should probably sell and buy again when its lower..
@_date: 2015-12-16 16:17:32
just use the BIP 120/121  it's exactly what you are looking for without the need to create every thing from scratch
@_date: 2015-12-05 17:19:59
in Google play it tells me the version is not compatible with my phone
so.. on what devices works?
@_date: 2015-06-23 02:38:48
if you are going to pay for it,sure.. 
@_date: 2015-12-08 18:54:43
10 cents? the transaction fee isnt far behind,so..that's pretty much zero because you will have to pay that once to send to the temporary address and the user will use it just to make a transaction,what transaction?that's the right question since there wont be anything else to transfer to his wallet after paying the fees..
so..atleast give more if you want to plan such 'reward' or don't do it at all
@_date: 2015-06-28 07:12:55
it will probably be lower then back at the same price as today..that's what i was saying..
@_date: 2015-06-01 13:44:26


then probably any suggestions we've been given here will no longer existed either..
At the time blockchain.info will no longer exist there will be plenty of alternatives to use your paper wallet with,even more since almost every wallet nowadays allows you to use it
@_date: 2015-12-10 17:43:52
comparing it to US dollar,too soon and too different things dont you think?bitcoin is more of a product/asset..
anyway,lets give it a try ..the us dollar have a wide use in todays economy and its worth does revolves around the country that creat it
@_date: 2015-12-16 12:11:05


doesnt..the issue still havent been fixed..
@_date: 2015-06-05 20:38:09
although more rewarding not to
i mean it will be better if regular Joe will tune in by 'accident' instead of having only 2-3 bitcoin 'fans' 
@_date: 2015-12-14 11:38:43
i think the ATM or whatever that was,send the bitcoin to that address and then(the OP) send it to	1BwaMyCnPcgJNSCdZj755ooDqDKWAyfF59 quite fast after being bought? ,though is it his address or a wallet like coinbase because
 No. Transactions	1168	
Total Received	482.08379236 BTC	
Final Balance	2.2662733 BTC	
that's quite high for a child and to be honest i don't buy the the storie because the time and amounts are to off to be true
@_date: 2015-06-29 04:17:23
Most country have 1-4 'users'(or whatever you wanna call it) per capital ..
@_date: 2015-12-29 15:42:36
you could use it with mycelium for android(not ios)
@_date: 2015-12-15 12:06:01
it would've been better if you added that when you first posted the image
anyways,just out of curiosity what was the fee the ATM took when you withdrawn ?
@_date: 2015-12-23 15:58:56
I just don't get it why pay a dollar or less every time you make a purchase depending on your bank pay a lot more in fees than you would buy them at once
@_date: 2015-12-31 17:55:12


let's not,i mean..what's the point? it doesnt offers the same network security as a full node and it uses same resources as a normal one to run it(minus the storage) so it will be better to just use an spv wallet
as for the case we 'imagined' above it will do nothing to improve it since storage was not as important compared to power usage
@_date: 2015-06-18 21:17:11
Because there were no transaction pending,so..empty block
@_date: 2015-12-10 09:49:13
really? the trust in the currency and therefore its monetary value and the number of those who uses it can be determined by the person who create it
so.. yeah.. it can change everything
@_date: 2015-12-12 19:13:50
its not a 10 minutes 'margin' but more of ~2 weeks before difficulty readjust itself 
and we all can imagine how much they will lose by turning the power off for that amount of time..
@_date: 2015-06-20 17:45:20
well said..
@_date: 2015-06-09 16:38:40
Why is not possible?
1.Fees...the price of bitcoin will be absurd if one wishes to do so
2.SMS payment can and will be reverted
@_date: 2015-06-07 06:58:46
that's one bad example..
1.peoples don't buy toilet paper online(most of population anyways..)
2.if you buy from a store nearby your location ,google will have no advantage of showing you adds for that item,for you to buy it online
But..they don't need that info for a online store,they know you visited a certain site and they know you accessed a certain page from a store ,specific for one item only(why? because you already seen some random adds on that page..)
@_date: 2015-06-28 07:48:35
just curious ,how much did you had(sold) ?
@_date: 2015-12-05 17:51:24
@_date: 2015-06-18 09:55:33
you can clean app data and use the seed to restore your wallet so that you can access the 'funds' again..
@_date: 2015-12-14 07:03:21
they still have to hand over the food and lets face it,there will still be more peoples who don't use this and just buy with cash or other means..
@_date: 2015-06-07 07:21:49
i do understand they can have more info on us,however they do have more than enough for what they need it to and in my opinion knowing what we buy at a store nearby will not help them as much..
@_date: 2015-06-06 20:34:49
no..they just point you to what you 'need' to buy,some might argue is the same..
@_date: 2015-12-15 09:04:02
so a rich family who owns an island decided to uses bitcoin?
very interesting news
@_date: 2015-06-06 08:57:52
Google already has that info..
But there will be some company/api allowing a bitcoin user to exchange for fiat and pay in a brick and mortar store without giving info about himself
@_date: 2015-06-19 04:58:41
might even happen more if we choose to increase the block size
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:40:36
while the address changes with every use as any other hd wallet that doesnt mean it can't be reused(the address),just that isnt advised
@_date: 2014-12-30 08:00:52
1 block ~ 10minutes 3 confirmation minimum ~30minutes
if you have the economic fee(as some wallet may call it)10 bits/uBitcoin it wont be confirmed always in first block(as the one with 100bits) so you may need to wait more..but not that much..hours..
You can still make instant online purchases ,but some site as the one you mentioned might require more confirmation to be safe from double spend.
So..dont worry :P
@_date: 2014-11-07 16:42:02
isn't that a contradiction to bitcoin itself by censoring ones freedom of speech in what you guys propose?[most of you anyways]
I know they are giving false 'hope' to those who sees the fake tips ,however that's not enough to take actions against them..
@_date: 2014-12-15 15:20:36
unfortunately that's why i sticked to blockchain.info as well,i like having the options to do exactly what i need..
though i would've loved a peer to peer solution..

@_date: 2014-12-28 18:07:10
they're **not** compatible!
@_date: 2014-12-28 18:13:13
**You can try MultibitHD(  ) and Mycelium for android(do choose to be a beta tester for extra features)
Now..for windows i know multibithd does not support 32bit version of the os,so i have no clue if it will work on linux,try that or build electrum2 from source**

good point..it does steer their attention towards bitcoin and what it involves and after all that was the main goal :)
@_date: 2014-12-28 18:39:34
the classic one is not compatible with the android version only the beta one
@_date: 2014-12-28 08:49:24


because of the fees and price volatility
---bank deposit,card fee,(paypal too?),bitcoin exchange fees,tinny transaction fees by bitcoin itself 
and to withdraw you go though the same route plus a 20-30% volatility that might actually be a loss..
it will take a lot of money invested in infrastructure in order for this to become cheaper (i.e ATMs that you have more than a couple in your country) 
@_date: 2014-12-01 18:09:25
hardware wallets? pretty much useless,is not like she'll keep a large amount on them,just buy her some bitcoins and let her actually try the 'system'
@_date: 2014-12-04 10:16:49
will this only be available in the US?
@_date: 2014-11-20 17:25:03
there are no wallets that has the features you seem to require
You will gonna have to hire someone to integrate them in your site..or whatever you sell on..
@_date: 2014-11-30 16:44:09
yes,i am on 32-bit system,even if my processor is 64bit,i guess that was the problem..

one of the dev for Mycelium said that is compatible with electrum 2 and multibithd,trezor too..
@_date: 2014-12-28 18:36:12
not only you didn't gave example of compatible programs but they weren't even both HD which is what the OP was asking for.. 
@_date: 2014-11-04 21:47:19
still.. he should go with Mycelium especially if it's for small amounts
@_date: 2014-11-05 21:34:01
only 3 delivered?damn..
@_date: 2014-12-02 04:45:56
i should have use 'he/she',guess i was paying too much attention to what i was writing while reading something else..
but anyways,my point still stands
It is not a good idea to hold a big amount of bitcoins because of it's volatility and therefor there's no need for a hardware wallet,i mean he/she will lose more from buying a hardware wallet than actually get their bitcoins lost(which is a very very tiny chance of that happening)
@_date: 2014-12-29 21:31:12
Do I need to wear a aura over my head or what?
Keep it and donate when will feel right, don't just jump in every site that tells incredible story's you never heard before :p

what other wallets are compatible with? 
regarding the wallet for windows made by you,every time i try to install i get an error "This installation package is not supported by this processor type.Contact your product vendor." 
@_date: 2014-11-20 15:19:55
paper wallets?really?how would that even work?you give the kids an amount of bitcoins and when they'll go downstairs to the store nearby they will gonna find out that the price have changed and they don't have enough or you'll gonna have to trust the owner or owners to not steal the amount if they have more then the money they need
Give the cash or buy them a phone,install a wallet.I suggest copay because you can give them low amounts for..candys and if they need more the kids could use a multisignature account so you ,the parent, can sign on for larger amounts
@_date: 2014-11-04 22:14:18

Why does it have to change?Or rather say..why do you think anything will change?

i'm afraid will be quite the opposite..
and no ,there's no such software
@_date: 2015-01-17 18:12:05
He may lose more to the price variation than the actual fees,most likely
I don't amend that,use cash
If you still wanna use it anyways ,do so using Mycelium on your iphone device not some web wallet so that your funds might get freezed..
@_date: 2016-01-18 14:17:01
nope.while you can import a bip44 wallet,copay uses a different standard so you can not use them both
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:27:04
it does changes,however is very limited to either 35% above or below the price of 6 exchanges
but you could just cancel the trade and use your wallet to transfer normally...
@_date: 2015-01-20 08:42:55
You have to create one unfortunately..
I do think is a good idea to introduce more peoples to bitcoin that way
Let us know how it worked ;)
@_date: 2015-01-30 08:25:09
because Mycelium is free,Trezor is not and it runs on their hardware,which doubles the risk..
Peoples dont store large amount of bitcoins on mycelium(no more than a few bucks),but they do on trezor
@_date: 2016-03-02 13:59:19
sentinel can't really show a qr code inside the wallet,so..mycelium is a better option if he doesnt need to get notifications of incoming transactions
@_date: 2015-01-20 10:49:09
or goes up since difficulty could be lower due to the price,after the price will rise again he could make quite a profit
plus..clean bitcoins without them being tight up to your name are always good..dont you thing?
@_date: 2015-01-27 22:36:25
so is excluding the miners who did a 51% attack..and relocating will take too much time(new ip),others means of acquire a new ip will cause a latency in which he wont be as efficient..
@_date: 2015-01-26 02:50:09
Probably *giggle*
Just use Mycelium,that will do :D
@_date: 2015-05-12 16:34:06
You seem to already found the solution : Mycelium seed(12 words or 24) for android and xprv keys of Mycelium accounts(1 xprv per account)
Sure..you may be in need to rescan the wallet often(in mycelium) due to using two different wallets,in mycelium the wallet will choose the next address while in electrum you will be the one choosing it..
@_date: 2015-01-25 19:41:12
you dont send them dollars..you send them bitcoins :P
@_date: 2015-01-27 08:24:04
 the safeguard itself it's the motivation for the attacker to do a 51% attack
Yes,he/she could create quite a few bitcoins after they have the hashpower to do a 51% attack,but then ..what would those coins worth be? $300(or whatever the price may be at the time) or just ..nothing..none will buy bitcoins anymore and the attacker will be left out with quite expensive hardware that aint gonna worth a penny and a massive electricity bill
That assuming he/she can acquire/manufacture the asics miners to generate enough for a 51% attack,but will probably be faster and cheaper to actually buy bitcoins instead to make them via a 51% attack

very few makes a difference between the transaction cost of the bitcoin software and the actual cost of using it(hardware,bank fees,market fees,volatility,etc..)
they only know the current cost of using their credit/debit cards,but that's not so true either,in most cases
Anyways..is gonna take a few years before the costs are lowered to something less that we now have with the banks..

Unfortunately it went from a decentralized system to quite the opposite in a very short time,but can't say it was not expected its just how the economy works ;)
@_date: 2015-01-20 07:01:41
you will get ~0.16 bitcoins/$32.71 per mounth with that miner
I think you should atleast try and negotiate the price if you wanna buy it,but you should buy it since the price will go up and you'll get your money back(+clean bitcoins) and some profit too
@_date: 2015-01-31 13:48:24
1.BIP38 paper wallet
2.offline android device(if you have a spare one or buy a cheaper one than trezor)
To be honest a hot wallet on a android device that is not rooted is safer that you probably imagined to be,as long as its encrypted and you use a strong password to unlock it
@_date: 2015-01-16 03:27:33
you can also let the users decide if they require that sort of privacy(settings|using spv or not,maybe with tor too?),i for one would not mind the extra CPU resources to finally have a wallet that notifies you of incoming transactions
@_date: 2015-01-27 22:41:25


you did not read yours..
Buying +800.000 anminters s1 to generate half the current hashpower is not possible
i was giving a best case scenario with antminter s4 2,000gh/s but will still require +70,000 miners
At current state its not possible to pull that out,even if you do your mined coins will A) not worth it B) will be revert it back(blockchain fork) and you will be excluded from the network(relocation of that amount of miners is just not feasible )

they are trying to make a profit..right?
so..don't expect to pay less than on an bitcoin exchange
@_date: 2015-01-19 10:53:35
create an account on a exchange ,deposit your Bitcoins there and after make a withdraw(they will send from their hot wallet/main address or whatever you wanna call it) to your new address
you should also hide your ip:
for that do try and use tor+firefox and a wallet that has that option too(Mycelium on android;on pc anything goes i guess)
@_date: 2015-01-20 08:44:44

@_date: 2015-01-27 10:17:18
i did read your post and others
While mining the blocks he would make quite a few bitcoins but the price won't just go down,there will be no more demand for bitcoins since everyone will notice,exchanges probably will shot down with the first block since it's probably monitored for that sort of attack
Gains for attacker?None..just a huge bill for electricity even more since in your idea he would use old/outdated hardware to pull it off
What would happen afterwards ? An update of the bitcoin-qt will emerge banning the attacker ip plus a small fork of the blockchain before the attack.Attacker will have to move his miners to pull an attack again which is not quite easy(aka months to do so)
Money to pull that off?
50mil EUR for antminter s5
80mil EUR for antminter s4
and that's just for having 50% hash power,you are gonna need more,plus a building, ventilation ,company and other technical and legal stuffs..

I do like the idea and the site(might need a little 'polishing' first),but:
1. as a seller i would like if there were some watermark on the photo displayed
2. as a reseller i would like to be given the option to adjust the price for something lower than double the amount of previous price
In the end , 'yes' ,i would use my own bitcoins to buy some photos that will appeal to me .
@_date: 2016-03-28 02:04:25
interesting idea,not sure how or if android pay/google wallet API is still something to look forward to, but that may create quite the competition for them(company such as coinbase,coinapult will eventually offer the same service as them)
@_date: 2015-01-10 06:06:43
unlikely the difficulty is to high for this older model, so mining is out of the question and there's nothing else you can do with it
@_date: 2015-01-18 21:06:57
Mycelium's new version will have a SPV mode where you no longer have to relies onto their servers,however that will be a bit more slower(as in taking a few seconds to update when opening the up instead of doing it instantly)
the only decentralized wallet for android so far is (using SPV )
@_date: 2016-03-02 03:55:09
a node has limited resources(ram)due to a low fee a transaction might not make it into the block and eventually will be discarded or due to a node restart

didn't knew they changed their mind since I didn't followed the project close enough lately
but even so.. it's not advised to use it the way was suggest it since that person will get caught for various reasons..

simple answer:  nope..not for a person,only for businesses ..
@_date: 2015-01-26 15:29:03
you could also try and lower the brightness of your phone,that usually does the trick for me ;)
@_date: 2015-01-31 07:00:09
it did not cost any..wallet was just not checking transaction for older addresses..founds can be spend on other wallets(and/or devices) or wait for a fixed version :P

So..who's buying the ATM..you or the owner of the bar?
@_date: 2016-03-07 08:14:06
does the screen still works?
if so you may copy or use share button in order to export the xprv key of the account you have the coins stored
if you wrote down the seed...things might be easier ;) 
@_date: 2015-01-16 15:06:23

@_date: 2016-01-18 19:03:51
you won't find a local seller here,try on localbitcoins,mycelium trader,bitcoin atms,liberty x ( locations)..
@_date: 2016-03-02 02:07:56

@_date: 2016-03-23 06:07:36
i really hope the new UI will still have a black theme for functionality and not be white
@_date: 2015-01-06 17:06:00
out of curiosity..what programs was used for generating the seed?
@_date: 2016-03-02 05:25:15
check some sites such as block chain.info
@_date: 2015-01-26 20:06:55
you are probably used to the corner of the street selling..stuff.. why not use Mycelium local trader and localbitcoins to convert it to cash?
@_date: 2015-01-06 16:23:36
Mycelium uses BIP44 while electrum as far as i know they use custom word list,in electrum2 may be compatible but i don't know yet..
@_date: 2016-03-01 18:16:06
just use electrum..its compatible
@_date: 2015-01-10 16:56:58
you can create  a script that splits its balance(from the first address you recieve the donation) to multiple addresses,that's the closest as you can ever get
@_date: 2015-01-19 11:54:46
so easy :p
@_date: 2015-01-03 07:42:37
you won't get more than 1 cent,at best (per month)
so..not a chance
Besides you will have to take into account that your pc life will reduce shortly after you'll start to mine;ergo it's still a loss and a big one nonetheless to mine bitcoin with a pc
@_date: 2016-01-26 17:25:44
what you use already.. mycelium..
if you need something for PC then import your xprv into the electrum wallet and both your Android and PC will be synced
@_date: 2015-01-20 12:03:20
It's not **if**,it's **when**
The price might still be low for a month or two,but will get back on track
@_date: 2015-01-11 19:10:58




that's a very wrong combination since coinbase freezes accounts even at the mere suspicious of those kind of activities
do use Mycelium in the future(with orbot)
@_date: 2016-03-01 18:46:59
you'll have to import the xprv key from mycelium into electrum(for every account you used)
@_date: 2016-03-27 16:19:03
they can sue you if the cost of doing so is lower then the amount you are in negative with them
but there's another problem...having an unpaid balance can really screw you over with other banks,so..
just don't use it,LBC is supposed to be used in person for similar reasons mentioned above..
@_date: 2016-03-05 12:35:20

Can I try as well, please?
@_date: 2016-01-18 09:17:46
you can't,while its probably on their 'to do list' ,right now its not possible
@_date: 2016-03-05 08:34:10
just get verified it's not like they don't know who you are because of what you are using to pay your bitcoins with..
so stop using or comply
@_date: 2016-01-27 22:07:46
never said i knew what was like and in my city i can only buy bitcoins and not obtain fiat in return for bitcoin
@_date: 2016-01-02 09:17:18

that's the change...don't think it matter in that case..
@_date: 2015-05-04 05:31:54
you can only get 'virgin' coins from a pool owner or non-pool miner(which doesn't exists anymore)
a pool owner will not sell you such a low amount
my point is that it ain't possible to obtain it and just doesn't worth it to do so,just load it like a normal paper wallet..it won't matter anyways
@_date: 2016-03-03 03:29:01
it doesnt follow the standard,true but it does uses a seed and offers a master private key and public key which can be imported into other wallets that follow or not the bip 39 standard
i suggested it because it can sign transactions offline,so..its the best option to a cold storage solution which you can have access to it whenever you need it without worrying about having a device connected to internet
@_date: 2016-01-27 15:53:32
the purpose is a decentralized trading platform but not an illegal one
for that purpose a server will do better then each seller having to host/keep a computer advertising an illegal object
@_date: 2016-03-02 18:04:10
sure it works,add account-&gt;advanced-&gt;scan/clipboard 
@_date: 2016-01-26 19:53:18
I don't know.. could it be that you pasted the xpub and not the xprv key?
@_date: 2016-01-27 12:10:15
the thing is..it doesnt allows to run it through tor,as dev's intention was..
@_date: 2016-03-05 16:50:58
if you don't have the seed/private keys you can't spend those bitcoins..
how come he has a watch only wallet?
@_date: 2016-01-26 20:32:28
that's not possible.. try again.. it must start with xprv
@_date: 2016-01-02 12:07:29
doesnt seems to be more than a scam,i'd advise against using it
@_date: 2016-03-07 19:35:48
one word: altcoin just with new type of problem because tried to avoid others...
@_date: 2016-03-07 21:58:40
i'm not gonna drive 2h just to prove you right,so..here's the situation in my country:few places accepting bitcoin on the map(but none actually does it)
however obtaining it is quite easy,every atm that used to accept fiat for bills,recharge phone allows people to buy bitcoins too(pretty much every city) but there's no place to spend it,atleast not in my country :(
@_date: 2016-01-22 17:31:37
at  per month and maybe double with 2mb blocks
your forever is no more than 2 months,does it really worth that much money for such little time? if you count 1 month to purchase and ship+setup,then...
@_date: 2016-03-08 08:08:49
i reported them(except for two,atm+store which were legit) whether will be removed or not..will see
@_date: 2016-03-10 17:44:15
or they could increase their security so that the attackers can't obtain both the bitcoins and blackmail them for more
@_date: 2016-01-20 13:45:29
1. if you have the seed(12/18/24 words) clean the app data and type the seed
2. if you don't,you can export your xprv key from the accounts that has bitcoins on them to the other phone
3. you can make a new backup and wait for 1min or ~2 weeks if you made one before,then follow option 1 steps
4. install mycelium on your other device,write down the seed and then transfer your bitcoins to that device and follow steps from option 1 on your first device
the choice is all yours ;)
@_date: 2016-01-26 18:12:19
in mycelium you have one or more accounts , click on it and choose export
you will get to a screen that shows you your xpub key and your have to slide to get the xprv key
on PC create a new wallet with that xprv
disclaimer I didn't had mycelium open will writing this so it may be inaccurate..
@_date: 2016-01-18 09:21:13
right now its  ,so..64gb won't be enough even more when the block size will double
@_date: 2016-01-27 17:28:30
they invested a lot of money in asic miners and you think they don't pay attention?
but paying attention is losing money..
@_date: 2015-05-06 06:26:34


there's plenty..


the question is..what are you trying to sell and how do you intend to deliver it?
if it's something physical,an 'object' of the sorts, the escrow(someone who's not connected to your company in any way) will be needing proof of the product state and that you actually send it to the location provided by the buyer (you could use a video for starter) then he would also need proof from the buyer with what he received(like..unpacking the order/object/product) 
if it's something digital..the buyer can only have faith,that..you wont scam him/her
* as someone mentioned above..if you want something simple,use the fiat system,but expect chargebacks :D
@_date: 2016-01-03 10:49:54
bitcoin is already instant,without confirmation ofcourse
if you want the extra security you will have to wait a little longer for larger amounts that's something that can never be changed 
@_date: 2015-01-24 21:10:12
me too when i open the link from your comment,teamviewer was not to blame but the user who allowed to get his pc infected with a basic script that initiated a remote desktop connection..
i have yet to see a case of theft that wasnt user's fault (except blockchain.info not so random keys generated) and that says a lot..
@_date: 2016-01-26 19:59:43
if it's starts with xprv... then I don't know why..
try another account and see if it's works.. on my PC I had no issues while doing that
@_date: 2016-01-27 11:11:28
Heavens ..where else?
@_date: 2016-01-15 17:32:21
doesn't look good but it's functional, it's the best you can get, a compromise that I can live with

not multisig,single wallet
tried both seed and file export/import..
@_date: 2016-03-05 18:25:14
in this case is generated by the seed,but you may also have a file backup of the wallet..in case you no longer have the seed..
but chances are..you no longer have access  to the coins.. sorry ;)

with what? an external HDD,so..a minimum of 100 euro/$110 ,don't know how much will cost to add more ram or sdram,whatever it uses because 1gb is not enough for bitcoin core
and then you may want to add a small LCD display and some other things..
i'm sure there are cheaper/better ways to run a node then a rasphery py and to be honest running the node on your main pc is not that bad when your away
@_date: 2016-03-08 12:07:49
3 times better,but still..not something i'll use on a big store and on smaller ones i'd prefer cash..
@_date: 2016-01-03 17:06:45
yes,you may use an online wallet,an spv wallet that query information of all addresses you own..
@_date: 2016-03-01 05:19:54
it only alerts you of one.. apart from core there isn't one besides since miners won't accept it there's no point in downloading those 60gbs either
just wait until the transaction is dropped from memory poll and resend or it might actually confirm...
@_date: 2016-01-27 17:40:03
maybe there's a bitcoin ATM in the city you visit otherwise you can find some one from the city to sell you via mycelium or localbitcoins
@_date: 2016-01-27 11:15:49
police sees some drugs or whatever listed,they can get the ip too easy because openbazzar needs the seller to run it on his computer on clearnet

@_date: 2015-05-04 10:08:49
is it this one?

1."soft fork" ,minor software update,other versions can still be compatible
2."hard fork" which only happened twice i think,though i'm not sure
you're mistaken the terms and the consequnces of those,that's all
@_date: 2016-01-18 07:39:10


if you want to support the network then go ahead and run it


you'll only use more resources without any benefit for security


not really,nodes won't consume much bandwidth for that
@_date: 2016-03-01 20:57:41
because of the fee ,should've been ~0.000837 instead of 0.0001691
just wait until it confirms..
@_date: 2016-01-18 15:48:21
if you have NFC on your android device than you should use a ledger unplugged with Mycelium wallet
so..yeah..its a good storing method 
@_date: 2016-01-18 10:58:36
backup/import issues,don't know if resolved but i won't suggest it for that mistake they made
@_date: 2015-08-03 12:23:54
well...can't be onchanin since you want to send them low amounts/dust transactions
so..why not just make a simple/basic script to tell them how much they earn and when they earn enough they can ask for their money?(like atleast $1)
while you may find a way to integrate it with changetip or some other method i may have to ask you..is it really worth it?i mean...the time to script it..
@_date: 2015-08-13 14:51:47
you should not have many accounts since there's no benefit to that,you may even end up having low amounts(few dollars) on them and since you can't spend from all of them in one transaction(like you can spend from all the private keys in an account)you will have to send the bitcoins/inputs manually to an address before spending
so..just keep using 2 or 1 and you should be fine ;)
@_date: 2015-08-03 06:13:01
localbitcoins and  channel on irc.freenode.org,although i don't advise people to accept this method of payment for  the reasons mentioned above(as in..can be reversed while bitcoin not)

so..it will be useless to even consider that,if you actually use bitcoin in stores(especially physical ones)then i suggest you move on to another wallet and wait until they fix their servers/get spv or whatever
if not,try and use electrum on pc to spend your bitcoins and watch your bitcoin on android with "Sentinel" just put your xpub key there and you get your notifications when you recieve bitcoins(actually do that even if you keep mycelium )
@_date: 2015-07-26 05:44:14
and that will be electrum..he should use the xprv key
@_date: 2015-07-17 16:19:44
why would you do that? your both using the same wallets, you've meet in person to trade and you just needed to press a button after receiving the fiat
@_date: 2015-07-20 12:47:27
Realistic? We're yet to find out if the entire season didn't just happen only in the mind of the morphine junkie
@_date: 2015-07-26 00:28:29
even if its not reversible you still need to trust the other party to send the money(insert currency) after you did
using escrows could be possible,but you both need to trust that someone else
so far..best to do it on IRC(irc.freenode.org) 
@_date: 2015-07-31 06:53:19
but..we have ATM that allows you to buy bitcoin in every city through Zebrapay and QIWI
@_date: 2015-07-21 01:38:24
He probably wants one with a pub key not just one address
@_date: 2015-07-21 12:22:43
that too combined with drugs
@_date: 2015-07-19 10:13:02
if you want to make it necessary for people to wait 5min to 1h in a store so that their transaction can confirm and not be able to double spend it after they exist the store then sure, do implement RBF and you'll see how much bitcoin will be accepted
other solution will be CPFP it will help confirming the low fee transaction by making another one with a higher transaction fee to another address
@_date: 2015-07-19 11:30:19
if you were a miner you would gain a few more bits per transaction but it will not worth more if you didn't take any fees at all economics as well as software are as important for security of bitcoin
@_date: 2015-07-07 01:52:32
there's still time to reverse it,as in double spend it using a higer fee
@_date: 2015-07-14 07:56:35
probably the simplest solution is using electrum,but you can also use the one from bainwallet or something like that..
@_date: 2015-07-19 08:30:38
they don't need to scan the qr code they can use NFC as other payment methods
@_date: 2015-07-14 10:11:46
you need internet to sign in and to chat,mesh network? not so much(the app has too many bugs anyways)
if you want p2p transaction head over to mycelium local trader
@_date: 2015-07-18 11:45:51
you can get the private keys from the backup but just sending the coins is a lot easier
@_date: 2015-07-14 05:12:32
you may need for android pay to be released and for companies such as coinbase to take advantage of that api
@_date: 2015-07-13 05:14:28
the hardware,the software..that's the easy part!!
The hard part is replacing that door which was busted by the authorities because someone who was on your wifi has done something illigal and you will be dragged in a court(or prison) not the one who paid 1$ to use your wifi
@_date: 2015-07-14 07:26:28
you can keep the funds in a multisignature address,choose a couple of peoples between 10 and 16 to cosign every withdraw from that address
@_date: 2015-07-27 10:42:44
didn't already? i though it did ..
@_date: 2015-07-14 06:09:40
think about different currency like bitcoin and litecoin
you have the main chain(bitcoin) and then the sidechain( a more insecure currency which does not have the same amount of miners as bitcoin does or is based on a centralized party)
@_date: 2015-07-21 02:16:58
I know doesn't mean one can not be useful

Here's the thing,while we do have fast and cheap internet the bitcoin don't need lots of bandwidth after the initial sync but a good latency which we can only provide in our country and not others
@_date: 2015-07-13 21:06:29
i suggest you to use 1 seed for cold storage and 1 seed that you use on the device that you keep online 24/7
from the offline seed you import a xpub key into your device to monitor your bitcoins and when you need access to it you just scan your paper(bip 38 too?) and will import it into memory temporary (which is quite safe due to android visualization) 
@_date: 2015-07-18 05:56:17


maybe they downvote your comment because bitgo is limited to 2 of 2(if you dont count the key from bitgo) and is not a viable option for those in need of more keys for more complex things(i.e not meant for more than 1 user)
@_date: 2015-07-13 07:34:03

@_date: 2015-07-22 18:26:22
weeks? sure :D
@_date: 2015-07-31 06:36:41
they do have problem with their servers(nodes),your bitcoin did not disappear,you still have them,just that sometimes you won't be able to see them in mycelium
if you need access to them export you xprv key  to electrum or close your app and open it again while hoping you connected to a server that works xd
@_date: 2015-07-14 16:17:50
I know they changed the address for an older version(don't know which one) but from your screenshots it shows that you don't have any data signal either
@_date: 2015-07-19 10:33:23
likely? sure you may think fees will be a big enough incentive for that to happen but that's not exactly true.. think about how much bitcoin will worth for the miners and those who bought it from them when will be that easy to double spend it
nothing or almost nothing, so they won't gain much by taking a little more fee on transaction
@_date: 2015-07-27 05:12:15


well..you just don't trade online,you are not supposed to trade online on that site or you will get screwed eventually,even not the first time
3.no,i suggest you use a different wallet and never,ever keep btc on exchanges,you may never know when they will take it from you,after x days of inactivity or such..(some did that)
@_date: 2015-07-14 10:18:06
you just dont,however there are alternatives,such as localbitcoins.com and mycelium
i suggest you do only inperson trades and not online
finding some ATM that allows you to buy bitcoin is likely as well,for example in my country i have a lot of atm that were used to pay bills and such,allowing citizens to buy bitcoin too
@_date: 2015-07-23 20:33:28
but the blockchain does prove you have bitcoin unspent
and singing a message process you are the owner of said address which does have bitcoin on it
@_date: 2015-07-24 08:53:23
you want to prove to someone that you have x amount of funds, there's no anonymity while doing that
but.. after you can mix your coins
@_date: 2015-07-26 00:14:07
i don't know exactly what you want,so..
you can sell btc online quite easily ,just need to give your address to someone and wait for payment
if you meant Mycelium Local Trader,well..i don't advise it to,since that was meant for in person selling,using other method that can be reversible or one that requires one of you to do the first step(as in sending the funds,fiat or bitcoin) is not a good option,since in-person you can not get scammed while online,it's very likely you will
@_date: 2015-07-23 19:40:17
I'm afraid the only way is proving you are indeed the owner of those said addresses
so.. singing a message for each one of them is the only way or making a transaction with the amounts from all your addresses to one single addresses and sign a message from that address
@_date: 2015-07-14 09:13:25
let's say in the future some pools will have a web interface where you can just paste the transaction and they wont broadcast it to the network only after they include it in their block
however the downside is that you will have to wait quite a while for that to happen since they dont have enough hash power to discover a block and include your transaction along with it
so..none will do it,unless they wanna wait a couple of days,weeks..instead of 10mins..
@_date: 2015-07-19 11:23:02
thanks explaining it better
@_date: 2015-07-21 08:46:29
maybe while I didn't tried this one I did tried conkite and was just not as reliable as I expected
@_date: 2015-07-27 05:54:56
Android-&gt;Mycelium (but since the current spams on the network it doesn't work that well,so..you'll have to wait if you wanna use it,but since it has more features than other wallets..you really dont have a choice xd )
so..i'd suggest schildbach wallet temporary until they fix things(mycelium devs)
@_date: 2015-07-22 17:25:28
to be honest..i would advise you getting electrum,its smaller,as in no blockchain storage needed(compatible with mycelium,xpub)can perform offline signing and multi-signature 
@_date: 2016-02-11 17:27:46
What if you scroll down and you don't read it? Most of people's tend to do just that.. I really don't see the point of this feature 
@_date: 2015-07-14 08:23:28
you receive your bitcoin to an address(multi-signature address ) then you make a transaction to pay a user(to his address) and the software boardcast that address to its cosigners(if all users use the plugin ,if not ,you will have to paste and send it manually to them so they sign it)
that's the simplest as it can get(you could use copay too so that users can sign the transaction on their phone or pc as well)
@_date: 2015-07-19 14:06:09
i was saying that if bitcoin transaction could be reversible(double spending) then fees would be irelevant as it would not worth much in FIAT so,RBF would not be an incentive to miners as the OP thinks but quite the opposite of that
@_date: 2015-07-17 16:16:41
there's no fee in current version
@_date: 2016-02-10 11:49:55
at least on your device,but there's also another problem..of those other apps that might try and obtain your password
so..i recommend you use a wallet that has its own virtual keyboard that will prevent other apps to steal it
@_date: 2016-02-02 09:52:10
you'll probably get evicted if you start using that much electricity
as for profit you still need to cover the hardware costs
@_date: 2016-02-14 08:55:42
he may do that once but due to the reputation he will receive for doing it he won't be able to do it again
@_date: 2015-07-14 05:08:03
well..the problem seems to be your connection,your phone has no signal and is not connected to wifi either,so..
but you also have an outdated version v1.2.12 the current one is v2.4.4 and i'm not sure but they said that the server address has changed and wont work with that version..
@_date: 2015-07-27 16:24:44
with armory you need to download the full bloackchain and there are plenty of bugs that will force you to download it a couple of times
that's why I like to use an spv client
@_date: 2015-07-17 16:17:05
no fee anymore
@_date: 2016-02-14 08:08:55
it is usable but its limited too in features

unless you give us more details such as your country, city and such we can't answer your question
but why would you even want to buy ASIC USB miners?
@_date: 2016-02-04 17:13:59
sounds good about reading it,however there will always be that someone who can exploit that particular function
even if that doesn't happen its still a problem of having to deal with price volatility of both coins and that you actually have to use an exchange in order to exchange both currencys 
@_date: 2016-02-07 12:18:17
the trick is to find someone willing to trade with you given the price volatility of bitcoin
@_date: 2016-02-14 11:30:59
most likely scenario :
old coins(before classic) will be included in both versions(core&amp;classic)
new coins already have  day 'cooldown' that can't be spend but most likely some exchanges/markets might hold down on those even more,atleast to find out the outcome of the possible fork
^ because most won't just take the risk of losing their funds
so..you can't make a profit of this fork i'm afraid :P
@_date: 2015-07-27 05:14:48
exchanges,more secure 1% fee
localbitcoins,mycelium local trader,in smaller amounts but not fee and at a higher price than on exchanges
it's up to you and how much time you need your fiat,but i'd sugest doing it locally ..
@_date: 2016-02-16 02:41:51
probably not
@_date: 2016-02-17 15:03:45
he should use an escrow if he chooses that
@_date: 2016-02-04 17:00:14


two currencys that both keep a ledger?how can you call that good?
@_date: 2015-07-04 08:29:13
Mailed? Maybe you can find someone on localbitcoins/ i would not advise for anyone to do that and as someone mentioned above there's not such service available
You should look for alternatives like in person trading: localbitcoins.com / mycelium local trader and maybe some Bitcoin ATM
@_date: 2016-02-11 17:37:07
Well you really don't have options  because most will assume the worst as they should.. Just them out and try any other way that benefits you more in your region..

one of the reasons you should never sell something online via paypal or alike that can reverse the transaction
@_date: 2016-02-14 11:22:18
Well..yeah,as an arbiter you may receive negative feedback even if it ain't true,but as a buyer/seller you just can't afford to choose such an arbiter because gambling on him would cost you more than you can afford
So..a negative feedback might put you out of business ,but there's plenty of fish in the sea..the only way to secure yourself is to keep the evidence from every dispute but that might turn out to be a problem with your costumers if they know you did that..
@_date: 2015-07-20 16:12:20
I suppose the only option not mentioned already is  on irc freenode
There you can find someone who you can trade in such amount but do register first and check the other user rating and most important try and use an escrow if you need help with that do ask
@_date: 2015-07-15 08:05:01
you evade one tax just to pay another one,just as told above me,sorry..
@_date: 2015-07-31 06:38:40


if you need access to them export you xprv key to electrum or close your app and open it again while hoping you connected to a server that works xd
guess i need to quote myself since i just answer to similar question 
@_date: 2016-02-02 09:57:44
the sites don't set the prices but the users do
on that particular site you will have to take into account what you really pay for such as... anonymity. transportation for the person you trade with and the hours or minute it takes for them to meet with you and complete the trade..
@_date: 2016-02-11 17:31:21
Let's not forget that will not be the only problem the newly generated coins will still be used on some exchanges before all will follow in line 
@_date: 2016-02-14 20:58:32


it ain't an exchange
its an spv wallet that does not connect to core nodes but electrum servers(or if you prefer calling them nodes)
so its a decentralized wallet and not an exchange
@_date: 2016-02-15 16:22:36
it uses their servers to store the list of buyers/sellers but the privacy does not lack because of that
@_date: 2016-02-03 09:49:29
wallets support it the pos will just have to add the means for it to work.. and by that I mean accepting bitcoin
@_date: 2016-09-19 20:20:25
with the tech? yes
as for actual experience only on openbazaar
@_date: 2016-09-22 12:01:43
some of them allows that, but from my experience most of them only allows to buy with cash and not sell..
edit: a bitcoin atm or another one that can also pays bills and other stuff..
@_date: 2016-09-19 19:59:49
i can if you want
@_date: 2015-04-03 21:30:45
you probably have gotten quite a few useful answers,however i would advise you to use the following setup
one entry level phone with just a xpub key imported into Mycelium wallet(so that your clients can't steal your 'money' ) and only use it with orbot/tor (so that none can find out who you are,or where you were at the time)
and your 'normal' phone with same apps(Mycelium+Orbot),so you will be able to spend the bitcoins and a few paper backups of your seed(12 words)
@_date: 2015-04-12 12:57:36


sounds good


i thought that was already done,or going to be done after 30 days..


will probably be limited anyways..due to the small amount you are in possession of ..
@_date: 2015-04-11 14:11:06
i too used it,however i do think the one who posted it is confused


it ain't,it's just one of the suggestions


it isn't that stable and for sure is really not basic either(i'll put it second for 'complexity' in the app store)


**1**.i don't know where he pulled of that numbers,..from a hat? it's one developer/person and maybe a dozens who may test it
**2**.it ain't the most secure,quite the contrary,it makes your ip public(therefor a target) and a few fake nodes can put an end to it as history showed
**3**.what makes every app secure is the android system itself,which is taken advantage off..


no it doesn't,unless you have rooted your phone..
**so..the author of the post clearly doesn't make the difference between Bitcoin-Qt and Bitcoin Wallet by Schildbach** 
@_date: 2015-04-11 12:54:43


stopped reading right there,the one who posted has no ideas of what he wrote
@_date: 2015-04-28 06:34:25
i suppose mycelium local trader was the only option left untold,do take  that under consideration
@_date: 2015-04-04 01:17:39
other than blochain.info there's none who can send to multiple addresses but even then you will have to split them up manually
@_date: 2015-04-11 08:46:26
i suppose it depends,what i mean by that is that you need to talk to a lawyer first,getting your licenses and other papers might cost you a lot more than setting up a website,renting a a place(if you plan to exchange cash) and some basic/cheap advertising..
@_date: 2015-04-11 10:59:19


i suppose you can pick a dark alley,turn on your phone and make some transactions(i suggest either mycelium+orbot or schildbach's ones+orbot[transparent proxy with root] )
does that resemble you of something?
the point is ,you can do it that way because in most country cops wont care for that..
@_date: 2015-04-11 14:25:31
with a VPN there's still a third party who you have to trust not to share your ip,i prefer tor(orbot for android) as an alternative


the only thing you'll miss is the notifications and the widget,having to push a refresh button sometimes is not that good for some situations
it ain't an SPV wallet,but the code is shared and can be verified,the only thing you have to worry is one of their servers not broadcasting the transaction,at which time you can just switch to another wallet if that ever happens
@_date: 2015-04-06 17:34:00
also a way to increase the number you mentioned above
@_date: 2015-04-20 16:07:57
maybe even link mycelium trader address with  address?(if it ain't already the same :D )
there's some 'trust' there can be of use ;)
@_date: 2015-04-01 06:45:47
same thing that happen to dodgecoin as well?
as in .. it's still there :(
@_date: 2015-04-06 20:07:51
it requires a password
@_date: 2015-04-07 21:33:52
i suppose you got to ask yourself..what kind of friends you have?
will they be interested in the simplicity of an android app and with a widget and instant notifications?then show them the 'Bitcoin Wallet'/bitcoinj
will they want something more advanced/with more features then show them mycelium wallet
offcourse..at first do make them install the testnet version so they can see how simple it really is..
@_date: 2015-04-11 16:47:13


why would you buy when the price is high and not cheap? that doesnt make any sense
@_date: 2015-04-19 19:14:30
and you are gonna pay another $101.95/month for electricity to keep your miner running,however..
1 it will generate very little heat for your house(unnoticed even)
2 you will need to set up some cooling system for your miner,in the middle of the winter ,in your home..
good luck..with..your 'heating' ;)
@_date: 2015-04-08 18:38:24
i suppose..it's up to how much you can invest ,let's take antminer s5 for example,it cost 340 USD ( 1.383 BTC ) which will generate 0.358(~$88.36) per month
you will only start to make a profit after 4 months,so yeah..it does seems to be profitable with free energy,however..
define what sort of free energy you have?as in for a home ,or the sorts,you will use a lot more energy than you probably have written with small letters in your 'unlimited' contract..
@_date: 2015-04-19 17:26:24
1.the antminter won't generate enough heat for your house
2.gas is cheap,$20-30 a month
3.electricity is expensive
@_date: 2015-04-03 10:59:01
one of the transaction will be approved and one will be dismissed (double spend)
so..nothing to worry..
@_date: 2015-04-12 12:47:21
that's not what i was implying..
i was merely suggesting to make use of a decentralized rating system build for traders(of currency and other things) in your current formula,because having already earned some trust is way better than hoping for the best(they can prove they are the same users by signing a message with their bitcoin address )
for those who do have an account there,you could give them a positive feedback when they repay the loan or a negative one if they don't 
@_date: 2015-04-12 07:05:47
no they don't,the servers runs as a hidden server on tor,you connect to the servers using tor and therefor your ip wont be logged
@_date: 2015-04-09 13:20:23
you should expect some borrowers to default,it's just the risk of doing business,as long as you invest small amounts on more loans you should still make a profit in the end
@_date: 2015-04-04 01:22:42
mycelium wallet is encrypted but not with the pin, the pin is only used keep out the person who stole your phone for merely a few hours before you move your founds to another wallet
@_date: 2015-04-18 05:38:12
you can find some nice peps on freenode irc,  that can sell you for paypal (do check their reputation first)
either that or go through and ID verification process ;)

most..do tend to let the wallets/applications create the seed/keys for them and not the other way around
@_date: 2015-09-24 06:02:11
probably because your fee was too low
@_date: 2015-04-11 22:51:10
sure..to broadcast your transaction,if they dont you can just import your 12 word seed/xprv key/private keys generated by the seed into any wallet..
you take no risk of loosing your funds
@_date: 2015-04-07 13:07:30
well..you can do that(not sure about ios since never used it)
from mycelium export your xprv key into electrum because the seed it ain't compatible ,or use multibithd(with your mycelium seed) on mac instead of electrum(however keep in mind multibithd takes a fee per transaction,10 or 100bits,don't remember)
bitwallet-it's not BIP44 from what i read in apple store description,you could however use mycelium for ios(once it gets fixed/new update)

@_date: 2015-04-14 07:22:46
a lawyer will give you a better answer but until then,just cash out in small amount from localbitcoins,mycelium local trader
with the cash you received pay for food and other cheap things at stores(without giving a mean to ID you) and with your salary pay for the others expensive things
but..don't spend more than 25-50%(in bitcoins) of your salary per month otherwise you will get noticed !
@_date: 2015-04-11 12:07:33
why would anyone accept bitcoin via paypal?
it still takes 3-4% fee and .35 $ or € for every payment,which is why none will use it over other solutions..
that being said..it's been quite a while since that was announced .. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 18:43:28
unlikely to find any business or person to sell for PayPal or other means that can be reversed/charged back
@_date: 2015-04-12 09:09:54
and i've done so,however that can only be done on a rooted phone,most users will not root their phone to increase their security and privacy but quite the contrary 
which opens up opportunities for your bitcoins to be stolen 
@_date: 2015-04-21 12:44:41
those were related to how it generate the private key(code have been fixed now) or MITM attacks done on a tor exit relay
so..you should not worry of your teamviewer,unless you use a proxy with it
however you should worry of blockchain.info because you get the worst of both worlds(you need to fear your connection not to be compromised,blockchain.info ' s servers ,your pc ,your email(backups..) )
choose some hotwallet like electrum and some paper private keys or another offline pc for cold storage keeping..
@_date: 2015-04-12 07:55:07
so is using bitcoin, your point?
@_date: 2015-04-18 06:41:34
no and neither shall you
@_date: 2015-04-12 06:17:25
how is the value calculated?
@_date: 2015-04-08 12:28:50


nope..it will still run on windows and that's not all..you will have to be carefull because the app will generate a new wallet everytime you run it(so you may send bitcoins to an address you will no longer have the private keys)
if you really want to run android apps on windows i would suggest using bluestacks
@_date: 2015-09-27 20:44:42
but that won't really be an escrow,both of them will have to trust a third party such as you or I to not "run" with the "money"
which i advise against it
@_date: 2015-09-28 00:47:38
how much trust can you really put in a stranger?
its easier to trust the technology and just take a little risk with volatility rather than losing it all,afterall the price has been quite stable in last month
@_date: 2015-04-04 02:37:28
hmm..let me see..none needs send to +5 address from a phone,that sort of thing is only usefull for companies which is best done by a pc
@_date: 2015-04-03 20:44:39
it probably happen because you switched the nodes,one of them did not 'saw' your previous spend so that's why it let you double spend it(not successfully of course) 
@_date: 2015-04-04 12:42:27
or encrypt your phone like you should and use a strong password for the lockscreen
@_date: 2015-04-12 08:07:45
also..the servers don't keep the IPs logged,if you wanna go the extra mile,they are giving you a choice to use tor/orbot
that's more than you can find somewhere else
@_date: 2015-04-06 18:45:17
i would not trust them..i had my ip banned for more than a week without a reason,got unbanned,but..
@_date: 2015-04-13 06:52:45
the only answer , don't know if the few ATMs are still where it says it are since those never get used
it's actually easier to acquire btc then the other way,using one of the zebrapay terminals
@_date: 2015-04-13 06:43:44
why is this bot here?
@_date: 2015-04-05 13:44:23


One PC could process every transaction in bitcoin only if it was the only one doing it(1 PC mining ),however because of the monetary incentive that turn fast into an arm race for creating specialized hardware(ASIC) thus increasing the difficulty quite substantial which no longer makes possible the first case i present it
@_date: 2015-04-04 01:12:39
but probably needed to have two phones because you need to know if they really paid you but at the same time you need to be careful not to be robbed
@_date: 2015-11-24 13:14:37
asking on reddit you already got your answer ..not far enough..
@_date: 2015-04-12 11:05:33
no it doesnt.. i have the 4.23 version
@_date: 2015-11-01 18:27:17
same as normal connection.. you only have to worry about request for balance on your addresses and broadcasting the transaction you signed
so.. only privacy leaks..
@_date: 2015-11-07 19:00:05
i don't have an ios phone and never will ..
@_date: 2015-11-03 07:28:52
i think it takes between 1 to 5 working days,depends on a certain factors(especially country) |a sepa transfer
so..how long did you waited before posting this?
@_date: 2015-11-03 07:49:12
cashilla's standard is sepa's since that's what it used and not Bank transfer
so  days is the average
@_date: 2015-11-01 15:25:13
is not really bitcoin when you have to hold it in an exchange
sure is nice to have a another card to pay with it but you would have to load it like the others since you won't be keeping your bitcoin in an exchange or at least you should not do such a thing
@_date: 2015-11-20 07:41:34
not in my country.. most stores do it on 20 done extend it till 27
@_date: 2015-03-24 20:09:08
well..in your case..you should not start buying equipment yet since the hardware will be absolute until the price will rise as much as in your sweet dreams ;)
@_date: 2015-03-08 19:31:14
it can use a spend pin as well,which is a good thing(can also be removed later)
but yeah,an SPV wallet and not a online wallet will do the trick,also mycelium testnet could work too since it has more feature on android than others
@_date: 2015-03-08 18:19:56
hmm..i would rather go with a testnet wallet,most peoples do own an android or iphone,why not let them test it with each other?
that will be the best way to test it
@_date: 2015-11-22 07:35:24
probably a company that will be in control of your bitcoins,you send them a text to do x or y...
off course i don't advise since we have mobile apps that some have more features than desktop ones(mycelium) and consumes very little data per month
@_date: 2015-11-02 15:26:19
@_date: 2015-11-29 17:17:28
it doesn't make it harder,probably easier,since miners will chose the transaction with a higher fee and not the one it came first
as for down votes..well..its Reddit,there's always peoples who will down vote you if they don't like what they see 
@_date: 2015-11-01 15:54:32


i won't get my hopes up yet,afterall they are not the only party that needs to make a profit (bitfinex)
@_date: 2015-11-02 10:44:18
they didn't failed,they just use something that can reach the entire population,something that is cheaper and safer than a $500 entry phone with NFC
and that is the usual microchip card we use in UE
while i would prefer using a bitcoin wallet,scanning a qr code is just takes too much times in a shop were speed is generating more profit,i know NFC could work better in that regard however is quite expensive &amp; advanced for a big part of the population of most countries 
in time it could be different but in the nearest future that won't change..
@_date: 2015-03-24 14:35:48
I don't think it makes much of a difference if you force "ChangeTip" name into your message or is at the end of the message hidden
What should be important is to explain why you send him/her/it the tip(a little more than 'awesome') and anything else..is just a mean to and end
^*beside ^i ^do ^think ^this ^service ^can ^be ^used ^for ^more ^than ^just ^typing(which ^happens ^a ^lot ^on ^reddit) ^and ^so ^i ^think ^the ^name ^just ^doesn't ^fit ^anymore..
@_date: 2015-03-29 07:25:54
so in your city you have homeless peoples with smartphone and electricity.. good for them..
that's one of the good cases I suppose, but even then you really think a homeless person is in need of coffee, not food, a job even?
what you are doing is pretty useless, unless you are going to buy cigarettes for them next.. (sorry for the sarcasm if you are one of those homeless person reading reddit..)
@_date: 2015-03-19 22:14:26
what did you purchased?
@_date: 2015-03-12 13:38:54
i believe a simple signed message to authenticate with the bot will work best,like a 8 character message
@_date: 2015-03-22 05:01:56
electrum can be installed on android too,but peoples do tend to use "app" for either phones or PCs
@_date: 2015-11-02 11:57:04
i think i already click on 4 posts...
@_date: 2015-11-02 06:08:31
be careful with coinbase they might lock your account for reselling it on local bitcoin
and most important your bank can freeze your account for using it that way
@_date: 2015-03-28 17:16:14
at the moment the only reason we have a fee is to prevent spamming the blockchain ,but that will change in the future once the reward will be smaller..
so..fees will increase,atleast the value in usd if not bitcoins,but then also the mining hardware will use less energy and may be even cheaper,so..what will happen in future we can merely guess..
@_date: 2015-03-25 17:41:23
well..i'm assuming he used changetip?
did you transfer it to another wallet?
@_date: 2015-03-30 09:51:34
but will be quite easy to make a script to check for the balance and then return a value
@_date: 2015-03-30 09:50:02
it's just too risky for someone to sell btc for PayPal since one can be reversed and the other not
@_date: 2015-03-31 09:39:16
you can buy me a coffee 
on a more serious tune,there's not much to buy with less than $2 online and if you want something physical you'll find out that even the delivery fees will cost you more.. 
@_date: 2015-11-17 17:31:39
only from other peoples.. you should take a look at bitcointalk forums
I bought some steam cards there, so I do recommend it but with caution.. take a look at who you but it from
@_date: 2015-03-23 19:20:30
and the smoke is real too? if it isnt..it shall be,soon...
Your parts will 'suffer'(get destroyed) from your choice of mining with a pc
Spare your bucks that you used to upgrade it and stop while you still can ;)
@_date: 2016-05-06 19:19:28
both wallets uses two different standards so the mnemonics won't be compatible..
@_date: 2015-03-22 07:55:05
you will get 1.936 BTC or 506.8 USD at the present time(per month),however the profit its a lot smaller since you have to pay for electricity  USD per month which leaves you with $250 profit at most,depends how 'cheap' your electricity is in your country
you could also try and increase your profits selling your coins locally,for a 5-15% increase in price
@_date: 2015-03-24 20:05:11
but not the qr code ;)
@_date: 2015-10-22 06:53:56
you can use bluestacks on windows and install mycelium for android from google play
mycelium for ios had a lot of problems and even without those at best its just a send/receive wallet not like the one for android(different dev team)
MultibitHD will only work for first account created and i don't think the ios version can export xrpv keys,so..only option is the one i mention above(assuming you don't have an android phone)
@_date: 2015-03-24 14:38:00
yup..buying is the best option at the moment
@_date: 2015-10-18 05:37:21
just like banks they can take the money if they need to
however you also need to worry about their security not only their success as a business
@_date: 2015-10-07 04:27:33
I don't know about electrum but doesn't request balance of addresses that you don't own like other spv wallets?
@_date: 2015-03-16 11:48:32
moh money,so gone
enough said..
@_date: 2015-10-06 10:40:40
I actually seen a couple of posts on Reddit about it as well
I though was reported already
@_date: 2015-10-06 19:33:30
you could use tor with onion servers (not sure of there still are for 2.0+) and change servers frequently if you choose a normal servers (not onion address)
@_date: 2015-03-16 06:40:01
having a public wifi might get you in serious troubles,especially if those that connect to it will use it for something illegal which you will have to deal with it afterwards and good luck explain to the authorities that it wasn't you ,but someone else..
if your still planning to go with it and ignore the above than you could use inject some code at the top of webpages with a short message referring to donations and a redirect link to a qr code with your address 
however i would suggest restricting the traffic to allow only access to bitcoin nodes(or your own node for that matter,see the SPV wallet for android) and maybe,just maybe some of opera servers
**^ be a good citizen and not a martyr,that's the best advice you'll ever need ;)**
 
@_date: 2015-10-29 18:48:57
quite the contrary it only says it can important it but does not uses the same standard as BIP 44
by the copay dev
@_date: 2015-03-11 19:58:33


Bitcoin is risky,not regulated by government or laws,only by a 'few' lines of code..we're aware of that


Yeah..the author did drift from..the tittle


there was no such things written in the article ,which begs the question..why are you liking us an article from an unknown site(which a Romanian like me didn't heard of) to an English community trying to twist('lie' would be better though) what was written?

i could explain further,but it's black friday,so..shopping :P
@_date: 2015-03-25 17:34:38
you'll have to be more specific than that..what wallet did you use?(software) or by what means did your friend send you the bitcoins?

let me see..blockchain size increase,orphaned blocks,price will be quite insignificant( from 25BTC/10mins to 1.500BTC/10mins;$300/BTC to $5/BTC)
should i go on? i dont think so..
@_date: 2015-03-30 04:29:30
authy can backup your accounts(go to settings/accounts) on their servers,mycelium uses a seed(12 words)to generate the keys but don't forget to wipe your phone if you give it to someone else(it also store a copy in your root folder| data\com.mycelium.wallet.WalletApplication\databases\walletbacking.db)
@_date: 2015-11-02 09:10:44


that will never happen,small stores will always prefer that over cards or even bitcoin


how about none?
a simple search would have informed you before posting such silly question..
@_date: 2015-11-17 11:01:35
one time access versus multiple access(think of it like a login,you pay you have access more than one time..) 
@_date: 2015-10-18 02:27:04
tried it on testnet myself
@_date: 2015-10-26 03:25:08
Schildbach wallet is more of a receive/send wallet while mycelium have a lot more features even more than PC wallets
the cons to mycelium is that it doesnt have notifications for incoming payments while in background (they might add it with SPV feature implemented though )
so..i have to use an additional app called Samurai Sentinel to display my notifications while i'm not using mycelium
as for privacy, bloom filters doesn't work that great (Schildbach) while with mycelium i can use tor(no ip) and they don't keep records(i'm willing to trust that)
@_date: 2015-03-02 07:53:02
i like using Bitcoin Ticker Widget ,it refreshes every 1min and it has a nice look when adding more of them for different exchanges(screenshot  )
or if you prefer one that updates in status bar(if you use other app as well,try Bitcoin Checker)
@_date: 2015-03-19 05:52:57
another bot?
@_date: 2015-03-28 09:52:01
do you really think a homeless person will have a smartphone?
@_date: 2015-03-25 17:44:48


i dont know..could it be the public address and private key by any chance?
@_date: 2015-10-28 13:58:25
they don't use BIP44(both),only Mycelium does while Copay only allows you to import BIP44 but it will generate P2PKH addresses for 1 of 1 accounts
that being said..use only 1 App
@_date: 2015-03-10 14:52:34
nice try to scam some peoples
@_date: 2015-03-15 11:11:58
sure,the simple design of Schildbachs Bitcoin Wallet is quite nice,but if i were to choose between design and functionality i'll choose the later and hope Mycellium will finally receive the new look was promise 
@_date: 2015-03-08 18:16:10
1.A country can not stop peoples from using it
2.It can stop miners within it's borders
3.It can stop large merchants from accepting it
so..solutions: proxys  (such as tor)
If it were to happen i would expect to be similar to the way drugs 'works' ,a guy in a hoody in a dark alley selling bitcoins to those in 'need'
But i just described the current situation in most countrys because of the money transmitter licence they need in order to trade bitcoins outside of a licensed exchange 
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:19:02
you will have to consider a payment method that can not be reversed(charge back),that's why is better to meet in person and do a cash trade
@_date: 2015-02-22 13:01:07
pretty much that..tor will do the trick only if you are careful not to use the program without starting tor
you could use also use mobile clients such as mycelium via bluestacks..that  works well for my privacy
@_date: 2015-10-26 13:34:55
I use mycelium, but if I'm waiting for something important I use sentinel as well..
it's a choise one that you won't have to make in the near future
@_date: 2015-02-22 07:08:55
i guess more consumers will start using bitcoin if there's a way to buy it without using banks and exchanges
so.. get a few bitcoin ATMs in your city and make some discount on your products for those who uses bitcoin
also where you place those ATMs have someone to explain them what is bitcoin, what wallets should they use and how to mitigate the price volatility(using coinapult) 
that's what will increase your volume, keep it simple..
@_date: 2015-10-31 02:17:12
we are talking about a dollar or two not a thousand
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:31:26
and yet  you'll have to pay the same for bitcoin as well.. you know.. to buy and sell bitcoin you still need to pay the fees to banks and exchanges
we're just not there yet, when you could trade them locally and don't have to worry about the price volatility too
@_date: 2015-02-01 10:21:05
nope..i'm afraid it will be way more complicated..and the cost..i dont even want do to the math :P
@_date: 2015-02-23 14:21:45




That's not true,nor it should be
Afterall its an HD wallet..the address should not have any bitcoins since it wont be reused,besides some might prefer storing the bitcoins in a BIP38 encrypted paper wallet for the exchange


Same could be applied for bitcoin as well,with a gun pointed at his head he/she would had you over the bitcoins
**In the end the only protection is the place of the meeting,some public place with a couple of cameras (maybe even in a bank)**
@_date: 2015-02-22 18:31:24
if you are still in UE then buy some bitcoins from a local dealer/ATM and then sell it back in the US
None will know you did that ;)
suggesting using breadwallet for iOS and mycelium(+orbot) for android
@_date: 2015-02-02 03:43:29
don't count on that every time,besides you won't always use your bitcoins in less than 1 hour after you purchase them
i suppose you could use services such as coinapult and bitreserve to minimize the price volatility until you want to use them(they sell your bitcoins for usd and will buy them back when you want to use;keeping the same amount of usd in your account)
@_date: 2015-03-20 22:18:47
unlikely,some of the wallets used to have problems receiving from transaction with more outputs (10-50 or so)
beside,it's not like you are gonna send to that many addresses from your phone but only a site/store owner will be in need of this feature..
@_date: 2015-03-12 13:41:01
if it happens again or you don't wanna wait,just double spend it without that small input
try bitcoin-qt
@_date: 2015-02-12 10:36:44
What prevents them from having security? Well .. bitcoin itself I guess.. how does one prove that was paid or he paid his loan? the pseudoanonimity can be a problem in a court of law
but then it will require bitcoin to be recognized as a currency and be regulated to even get in a court
@_date: 2015-02-01 10:10:07
it would cost you:
0.015 BTC/day ~$4
0.45 BTC/month ~$100
Besides the cost(without it wont confirm,btc would be stuck) you wont accomplish much,your btc transactions can still be tracked to you..
do look at coinmixers/coinjoiners like darkwallet,etc for better alternatives ..
@_date: 2015-02-25 18:10:26
i don't know much about your OS,so i'll assume you may have windows,if so then search for quickmark and download that application 
or follow this link
@_date: 2015-10-30 21:11:44
if you do..keep the private keys..kids might throw them and since we have a finite amount of bitcoins..you got the idea :(
@_date: 2015-02-22 15:34:46
a bitcoin url or a bitcoin address will do ,depends on wallet app
but i think a bitcoin url will be better..for better compatibility
@_date: 2015-02-14 11:57:37
btcjam is the most active
however the problem is not trusting the site/service but the user to pay your money back which can be quite a problem if you can not afford to lose large amounts..
@_date: 2015-02-22 16:33:16
also..be careful which one you buy,it has different sizes with different amount of storage,so..make sure first you can actually use it for what you need
@_date: 2015-02-16 20:40:31
i would go with multibit and electrum for pc ,never choose a website of which you don't control the private keys or others can access them easily 
@_date: 2015-02-15 16:13:36
Because when done right,it anonymous 
@_date: 2015-02-01 17:56:00


the best install ever..great job!
@_date: 2015-02-13 11:24:52
that saved 6min of life,thank you!
@_date: 2015-02-11 08:40:27
did you actually verify the seed after you wrote it down?
@_date: 2015-02-22 13:27:30
lower than bitcoin since you still need to pay those in order to acquire bitcoin...unless you have someone in your city selling in person but that's a little too early for most of us..as in in my country theres only 3 atms and only in the capital
besides you need to worry about the price volatility as well
in other words main stream adoption is requiered in order for bitcoin to be cheaper
@_date: 2015-02-15 08:26:40
you could use btjam and loan other peoples money,however you should choose carefully who you lend to
other than that i could not think of anything else,except trading,but that's even more risky..
@_date: 2015-02-26 14:54:32
that ,and they also sell cheaper for the same reason,although the reason why they may do that is a little shady..
@_date: 2015-02-12 10:38:15
which is not in most countrys and won't be any time soon or at all
@_date: 2015-10-06 05:52:14
I've seen a lot of people recommend you copay, but you should wait until they fix the import wallet function
because right now backup seed doesn't work and you will end up losing your bitcoin
if you want something good just stick with  electrum , one online wallet and one offline wallet for the second signature
@_date: 2015-02-16 21:44:22
as in..turn off the damn server...
but that's up to each to decide what to do after an attack and whether they can even payback the amount stolen!
@_date: 2015-02-19 18:32:19
have to ask..is it sync?
if it is..you'll probably have to resync/rescan XD
@_date: 2015-02-15 09:13:15
most likely they moved to bitfinex ~74k ,while bitstamp ~19k and btc-e ~19k
coinbase exchange is at ~14k ,so its way bellow others..
i guess it's too much of a risk get your account frozen at coinbase to use it,that if you are in the US,otherwise don't even consider this exchange like the rest of us
@_date: 2015-10-10 20:26:21
you're not gonna sell any for anything
basically..operators charge quite a fee for that kind of payment(sms) and there's that problem that it can be reversed..
why do you even have 200 euro on your SIM?
LE:You could sell it to friends/coworkers for fiat,then buy bitcoin..

then it will not be a full node,the blockchain needs to be kept so that we can keep the network "honest" ..you know what i mean..


only allows to download the blocks not in the order were made(genesis block to present number) but the ones that are available first(i think torrents are a good example of what i mean)

using a password with the seed on your trezor will generate different accounts,so..just try and remember the password as well,i do hope you wrote it down with the seed though

Where's the freedom of speech?
and you also plan to use bitcoin to..remove it?
@_date: 2015-02-22 17:28:42
I've read that a long time ago, since I don't find the NFC technology that useful and most important cheap to actually be used mainstream..I don't care as much
I think QR codes or Bluetooth will work better as a payment method
I guess that's what I like of BTC
@_date: 2015-02-15 17:52:21
openbazzar? you should try that..
@_date: 2015-02-02 02:33:20
you also have to count the price volatility not only the transaction fees

though would not be hard to track those exceptions either,a group of people,an exchange, a law enforcement department will have the means to get it done
those answering the jrm2007 question,keeping your anonymity is quite hard to do for the average user..the one who need to ask in the first place ;)

the only security is the user rating.. the more information you give about yourself the better you're rated
however from there on if you choose not to pay the loam there s nothing that can be done against you

when he does that he should add the USD/EURO/Bitcoin addresses to his wallet..to dont suffer too much of a loss waiting to log in to your account

@_date: 2015-02-23 18:35:51


you clearly didnt even used the app..i can set up sell trades even if i dont even have bitcoins on any addresses in the app
@_date: 2015-02-13 10:44:36
just create an address for each transaction(product sell),after the bitcoins are received you can create another transaction from the first address and split the amount to you and the person you want to share the profits with 
@_date: 2015-03-22 04:58:13
you can use the mycelium seed with multibithd but not with electrum,however you can import the xprv into electrum so you'll have the same outcome(without using the "12 words")
multibithd does not allow me to use the second hd account on mycelium from the same seed while in electrum i'll have to switch wallets(different xprv key)
@_date: 2015-02-10 08:54:10
it will not be the value(not price) of bitcoin that will rise,the value will be the same
but the value of dollar that will fall
for example you buy a coffee for 4,6 mBTC($1) today,that coffee will still cost 4,6 mBTC($15)in the feature,only difference is its value in the national currency wont be the same..
@_date: 2015-02-22 07:39:47
all exchanges require you to be 18+,those that dont comply with the laws should not be trusted with your money
so..i'm afraid LBC is your only choise,however do consider using often and with large sums of money might get you flaged at your bank which will not end up well for your account and you may even have to deal with money transmitter licences if there's a need for one in your country(whatever that is)
@_date: 2015-02-06 13:47:42
it doesnt generate a new one when you open the app,but only when you receive some bitcoins on the current/last address (the one you see on the balance tab/main screen)
you will have same balance on both ios(after new version comes with a fix to scan old addresses on the hd account) and android version,as long as you used same seed with no password after a clean install
also..you can use bluestacks for windows,lowest resources to emulate android apps..the app works well there as well ;)
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:02:36


the best install ever..great job!
@_date: 2015-02-08 17:41:12
you can log in to their website and transfer from there..

i stopped watching at "unconfirmed",which is worse?The cashier have no clue about the method of payment or the one who choose it to pay with it?

a bit to late for usb miners,this 'age' is more appropriate for a couple of antminter s5 miners,which isn't something anyone can afford (plus thinking about a location with enough power,possible free and cooler weather )

defaults is all you'll have to worry when you deal with peer to peer loans, choosing carefully who you loan to might just make the difference between profit or a loss and splitting your money to more people (1 dolar there and another to..)
at the end of the day is nothing more than a gamble .I don't  suggest using it..
as for sites btcjam has more users..

i believe that's how you do it in Armory
It seems to be a common bug found in many wallets..

200,000 a year?
ok..i suppose it might be a problem to find traders locally(for larger amounts of money) those who you can pay with cash,without leaving any trails that can be used against you in a court if you don't mention/deny you have hidden bitcoins
besides if you are planning to not divorce in a year or two you will also have to think about bitcoin value,will it change it's value or will be replaced by another version,a better one(will happen eventually,not in the nearest future anyways)and your savings could be worthless..
a prenup can revoked with a good lawyer while bitcoins can't be taken from you(hint:use a 12 word seed and remember it)unless you let them,sure jail can be an incentive but i'll rather do 1-2 years jail time and keep those 1-2 millions after getting out..my choice always.. ;)  
@_date: 2015-02-22 13:11:32
unfortunately the solution will not change if its an online store,maybe he can still find a way to place those atms
or hire some peoples to trade bitcoin via lbc or mycelium local trader
either way..he needs to make bitcoin more available to purchase for the average joe
@_date: 2015-02-08 17:53:17
this version does not support standard bip44,but at least you can import the xpub xprv keys into it from other wallets that do that,such as mycelium(for android) which is what i needed anyways for my pc
@_date: 2015-02-17 20:02:38


If you are going to repay users for problems/attacks that might happen on coinapult side which will result in users losing their coins then do so,however i suggest you should make it very clear that their bitcoins are being sold on exchanges when their "locked" and bought back when they are "unlocked"
how are you going to implement it?from what i understand is that users will not have accounts on coinapult and mycelium will have one 'main' account for all its users
which is fine by me,i like the privacy aspect in that,as in no email required and keep using tor.

probably a few satellites in space could increase the speed to actually make it to work
but..you wont really mine on mars,only relay the transaction to earth where most of our civilization will live 
but a lot will change in future ,who knows what currency we would use then?
@_date: 2015-02-23 14:07:33
you pay a fee per 1k of transaction size,there are already mentioned above what can increase the size of transaction
in mycelium you have 3 options Economic(0.00001 BTC/1kb ~ $0.00234)Normal (0.0001 BTC/1kb ~$0.0234) Priority(0.0002 BTC/1kb ~$0.0468)
Economic might take a few blocks before getting confirmed (1-10 or so) ;Normal usually gets confirmed in 1 or 2 blocks and Priority will get it confirmed in the first block
The only thing that matters is how fast you need it confirmed,if you are at a store you dont want to wait a few hours but pay more and wait less than 10min
 ^ only for more expensive products
In conclusion fees are pretty low compared to any other payment method,however since you have to deal with price volatility and same fees(banks,exchanges,ATM up to 15%)from the fiat system,**transaction fees are the least of your worrys**
@_date: 2015-02-02 14:37:56

Really..that's the cheapest you can ever get ;)
send your coins to it and only use it once(to unload the address)then make a new one,and so on..

there is none.. you have to trust the person who you lend money that he or she will pay you back.. which can be a massive problem for you

can we have the apk for beta3?
the alternative is building from source :(
@_date: 2015-02-13 08:06:35
public ledger plus you send the IP to the nodes when you make a transaction
@_date: 2015-02-12 09:56:08
bitcoin is not meant for micropayments.. and the transaction fees will make sure of that in the future
@_date: 2015-02-17 18:41:02


perhaps still show the number of confirmation in "details" ? some of us still need to know the numbers..

just find a app on play store that write the nfc tag with a 'text',for example 
and after make a link to save it on the nfc tag,like:
for the cold storage tag use your private key instead(not public)
