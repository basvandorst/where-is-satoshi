People are delusional.  They want to buy into every hype scam thing so they can claim Bitcoin is so amazing and justify it going to the moon.  Just look what happened with Paycoin to see how people can be deluded so easily in the crypto-currency space.

If they team up with major manufacturers they could secure a monopoly fairly easily, or maybe it will be a duopoly, which is not much better.  Then the government makes a law that embedded chips in devices must follow their regulations, and give the government all the private keys to be in control of the chips and thus Bitcoin.

I would bet probably Mycelium will implement keepkey support soon.  They have added support for a lot of hardware wallets including the new ledger unplugged.

No because mining pools are made of decentralized miners that can choose to leave the pool any time if the mining pool misbehaves.  Its much different.  These chips would be like a giant botnet harvesting the energy from billions of people's devices worldwide, whether those people have even heard of Bitcoin or not.  Those people with the chips in their devices would not be able to opt out at any time, they would be locked in to 21incs way.

Thanks for posting this.  I think its a real danger that not enough people are talking about.  I got censored the other day for trying to make a similar post.

Just curious, which feature was it that they added that you did not like?

I thought this was the most informative:

100% legal is not a thing.  Anyone can comb through the books and find illegal stuff that you have done.  The average American commits about 10 felonies per day and doesn't even know he is comitting them.  They can't patent hot wallets or tip buttons or anything else.  Its a joke to think that they can.  They could try to patent the air and water too, but it doesn't mean they own it or can enforce their fraudlulent patents.

Wow really? That is even worse than I thought.  They could potentially team up with phone and PC manufacturers, or even applicance manufacturers and get their chips put into billions of devices.  Its like a giant botnet parasiting off of billions of people's devices.  How else can you justify the huge amount of VC funding they have received?  We may be screwed.

Yeah they are mining your data too, and probably selling it to the NSA.

$239? Wow, I was hoping this would be cheaper than Trezor.  Hope they reduce the price soon.
