The murder for hire was with the FBI. DPR only mentions killing someone else to negotiate a better price. There is no evidence he ever ordered a hit before then (and if he did, why use a different hitman?). So the charges are "attempted murder" and are part of the Maryland trial. In the current trial the proof of him hiring a hitman was only used to prove he wasn't deserving of leniency.

It's totally true. I am not going to name the bank, but I went to my branch to discuss about a car loan. When I brought up Bitcoin the nice staff member went into details on how Bitcoin is destroying their ability to give loans, and is destabilising the market (ever so slow). He went on to mention that the head office released funds to have their own public marketing team to help combat the dangers of Bitcoin. I got to meet a couple of them that came back from lunch. Young lads, minimum wage, but they get to surf reddit and Facebook, and get paid for it.

He hired an undercover FBI agent to beat then kill a blackmailer. He even wired money to the FBI agent before and after they faked the assassination. He also requested a hit on another guy, and kill 3 others who just happen to be in the apartment (so they could raid it). 
He also claimed he had killed six others. 
On top of that he even kept a journal on all this. I recommend reading the court documents.

MS are not accepting coins. The third party is taking your coins, converting it into fiat, and then buying the gift card on your behalf. You can tell this because the UI shown in the picture above is exactly the same as the UI mozilla used for their donations. 
It's great because not only do they get a transaction fee, but also a cut from the gift card for selling it. 
Or to put it another way, I can go into GameStop and give them 6-7 used games and they will give me an Xbone gift card, therefore MS accept second hand games as currency.

That isn't how a Ponzi scheme works. The point of a ponzi is to give perceived profits. The second you try to cash out those profits it will magically disappear, unless you do it early or keep enough suckers putting money into system (or easily preventing them removing it).

That chart is a bit misleading. How many of those transactions are for actual goods and products, and how many are from miners or shuffling money between wallets. 
@_date: 2014-10-25 07:31:51


A ponzi scheme is where the earlier investors are paid by the money of the later investors. There is no initial value or money. It collapses when a small-medium number of people attempt to get all their money back. 
A pyramid scheme the early investors take a cut of the later investors profits. Requiring later investors to sucker in more people to try and make money. (Which eventually becomes impossible to do). 
They are illegal because they rip people off by design.

It's a nice speech but has a couple of overlooked points. For starters, in order for it to work everyone would need to use Bitcoin and stay using Bitcoin. That isn't happening as any companies that offer services convert it back to $ so they use the money they made. So unless you open a commune it isn't going to happen. 
Second you are expected to pay taxes on bitcoins. In $.

You mean the logs of the conversations where he requested, planned and paid for the hits? Or the transaction logs of the Bitcoin transfers before/after the hit?

Or where the judge actually brings up these presented facts in the final ruling?

Except the coins are useless until they are verified by a third party (otherwise it's just like a check). 
Also I don't understand why people keep going on about no chargebacks is a good thing. Especially considering people keep suggesting to use an escrow to exchange. 


I'm not seeing how changing money into Bitcoin to exchange it, only to have to turn it back into money to use is a good thing. It's just another pointless step (unless buying drugs).

Let's see I can use cash, check, bank transfer.  
Or I can convert my currency into Bitcoin, meet the person, or use an escrow. Both using some electronic device. After the transaction is completed I then have to turn the Bitcoin back into cash. 


I already use a credit card for that. 


As a consumer I would certainly want some protection when purchasing. Bitcoin in no way offers that. You could go escrow, but then it stops the claims that you mention. 


My guess is you haven't had the fun of buying a car or house yet.  It's a little more complex then swapping money. 


Micropayments are pointless. They are just a form of wanking / way to try and spam adverts about Bitcoin.

There was a large ransom paid off in Bitcoin for a kidnapping. This kicked it off as it pushed up the price. 
After that there is speculation that there is a Willybot2.0 currently on the Chinese markets (based on trade frequencies, disparity with other exchanges, etc). 
So it's a bubble. You need to ride and jump just before it pops. If it is a Willybot2.0, you need to jump before it comes close to popping, as people just disappeared with everyones cash. 
TL;DR  
- Don't leave your bitcoins on the exchange.

That is not the reason at all.  
There are people using purse with stolen credit card data. What they do is buy the voucher with the stolen card, and convert to Bitcoin via Purse. When the theft is finally reported Amazon invalidate the voucher, or have to report people using the voucher to the cops. All of this wastes time, money and customer satisfaction for Amazon. 
Purse is in no way endorsed by Amazon. 
That aside, it's also a great place to launder money.

I am saying that you thinking Amazon are trying stop people spending gift cards is wrong. For starters $1.7 billion is nothing close to what gets put through PurseIO. 
The amount of gift cards going through PurseIO is like a gnats fart in a hurricane. 
However PurseIO you get [up to 25% discount]( on gift cards. 25% discount is clearly dodgy merchandise. 
Other gift card purchase sites average around 3%. 
Also I only picked the first couple of links I recalled. Just google "purseio gift card stolen" for more.

Assuming a private key size of 256 bits...
256bits = 32 bytes. 
=&gt; 31 x 256  =&gt; 7936 possible combinations. 
Time to brute force would be in the milliseconds range. 
Assuming "letter" defines a nibble (4 bits) then you have... 
63 x 16 = 1008 possible combinations. A human could manually brute force that in an hour or so. 
All that assumes a fixed location for placement of missing piece. If it could be placed anywhere then it's...
(31 x 256) x 32 = 253,952 
(63 x 16) x 64 = 64,512
512 bits would marginally increase that. At best 1,032,192 combinations. 
Conclusion: possibly one of the worst ways to protect your private key.
