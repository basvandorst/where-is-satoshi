Seems like you could make it your primary residence if you fulfill some requirements (from wikipedia, quoting Treasury Regulation Section 1.121-1(b)(2)):

Guys guys guys... It's just a correction...
BITCOIN EXTEMELY UNDERVALUED ��
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:54:37
Yea but wouldn't the ETF have the same risk associated with holding it in an exchange like Coinbase?  
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:48:28
You shouldn't, it's easy to say "coulda woulda shoulda", but the truth is bitcoin is risky. Investing more than you'd be willing to lose at any given time is dumb.
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:53:47
If we knew why, we'd be a lot richer wouldn't we?

It seems like they're patents for payment systems. The article doesnt list details. I don't think they are patenting the block chain itself.

Are you CRAZY? You can't ever look at your private key. Someone could scan your retina for residual imprints and steal it from there.

I'm with you on most of what you said. I think bitcoin will succeed but not for the "freedom from government" kumbaya stuff everyone seems to push.  And yes it's true your money is safer in a bank than in a bitcoin wallet, and anyone who says otherwise is huffing glue. If someone uses my credit card fraudulently, the bank covers it. If someone breaks into the bank and steals my money, the bank covers it. If someone steals my bitcoin wallet you are 100% shit out of luck and there's nothing anyone can do about it.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:52:19
As a noob, I get the basics of bitcoin, but how would one buy bitcoin without an exchange? Or is the idea to buy it through an exchange, then move it to your own wallet asap?
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:24:12
Yea I'm not an accountant but I believe you're correct, it's primary residence. Still, I'm sure there are ways you could make it work as long as you fill some basic requirements for what your "primary residence" is. Probably have to at least be living there at the time you do it.

I believe the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is yet to be realized, but it lies in the blockchain. You can think of the block chain as a ledger of every bitcoin transaction ever made, like a big huge long molecule made up of atoms (transactions) being added every day. 
But this blockchain system has more uses than just recording transactions. Turns out having something that can act as a permanent record and is decentralized and always available can be very useful.  Bitcoin might be limited in features, but the idea is in the future this and other newer cryptocurrencies could be used for anything that benefits from permanent availability of certain information. 
Things like contacts could be put on the blockchain so no one could dispute their authenticity, etc.

Take advice from me. DON'T spend the money. At 16, $1200 seems like more money than god. I remember when I was younger, thinking "wow If I made $1000 a month I'd be able to buy like 3 xboxs every month!" and shit like that.
Truth is $1200 is almost nothing if your goal is to just spend it. You can't buy much with it, and if you do, you'll realize it won't get you much in terms of happiness past a couple weeks of having a cool new thing.
My advice: Keep it as an emergency fund. I GUARANTEE you that the peace-of-mind of having thousands in the bank, which lasts permanently, will outweigh any feel-goods you get from buying something you want in the moment.
If you really want to spend some, fair enough, but set a reasonable amount like $100. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 00:16:37
We all wish we invested sooner, but I bet there are people in the future who would kill to have been able to invest right now.
MFW I bought in at $3900:

True, I suppose if the ETF had a fixed number of shares, and a fixed number of bitcoins, they could just store all of the bitcoins in cold storage, and the changes in price of the shares would match that of bitcoin.

Very possible but branding is powerful. Most people in the mainstream, if they hear about bitcoin at all, think thats the only one. It's the only one to go even a bit mainstream. It will likely be around for a while.
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:11:03
Man If I were you, I'd sell off the BCC while the getting's good. Depending on your lifestyle, could sell off your bitcoin and invest everything into dividend stocks and be set for life.
@_date: 2017-08-24 16:11:29
You could additionally do extra work in the mean time to invest more into it, meaning the final price wouldn't need to be as high.

This train has NO BRAKES so I'm gonna hold. Especially after I bought a bit more at the 4400 peak yesterday LOL

If you look at the "sources" for most articles these days, they just cite other news sites.

For a total noob just make an account on Coinbase. It has high fees for convenience but it's the easiest way to buy.

So nice to see all these great labor day deals!

Seriously, if I had a hundred million dollars taken from me, I would follow those people to the ends of the Earth, and probably put myself to significant risk. I feel like they didn't lose all the bitcoin, and had to have paid off the largest holders. How could you possibly sleep at night knowing there are anonymous people out there who know you lost what is the equivalent of centuries of generational wealth. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:48:11
What dip? Bitcoin is simply having a Labor Day sale like every other store!

Supposedly its all AI, even corrections. If enough people report it, it should automatically trigger someone to look at the code to fix why it thought that was the person, but they don't replace it manually.
Edit: It's gone now

Not totally sure what Rootstock is, but my quick search seems to suggest it would kind of be like ethereum's potential functionality where you can build apps on top of it? I agree, I think this is where much of the future is, at least for Ethereum, and maybe with this. If Blockchain technology is found to be super useful in the real business world, I can't even fathom how much the value of these coins are going to be.
I honestly didn't really understand what blockchain was about until I looked up the Ethereum Alliance, and saw real AAA companies all getting on board, read more about it, and I knew this shit's gonna be big.

Well if it makes you feel better, if you kept it in Mt Gox it would be worth zero

Coinbase is fine if you want an everything-done-for-you service. But you pay for that service.
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:38:12
The thing is, if you buy via coinbase, you're locked into the price even as you wait for the bank transfer. If you deposit funds, you have to wait a week or more before you can use your funds. I'd rather pay a premium to be guaranteed to get at least somewhat close to the current price.

I don't trust ICOs. I've looked at a bunch of these ICOs and a vast majority do not go up in price. A few do, but you can't really tell which ones. The only people making money are the ones creating the ICO, because they're essentially pulling money out of thin air. 
Also, how much are you really willing to put into each ICO? I wouldn't want to put in more than $100 on the absolute high end. Even if it explodes, and goes 10x the price, it's only $1000. Yes that's a lot, but how many ICOs do you have to invest in before you get one that goes 10x? Certainly more than 10, and you'll be lucky if one even doubles in price. Even if it goes 100x price, you've got $10,000. Yes that's really awesome, but how many coins do that? Have any?  And even still, $10,000 is not a life changing amount of money. You'll never get rich off ICOs unless you get incredibly lucky and invest a stupid amount of money.
