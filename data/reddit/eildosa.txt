So if I get a coinbase transaction one day, then 1 year later If I discover an other block the tx hash will be the same?

and what about the date, same date for both transaction, and block 91842 is dated from 21:04:51 but received at 17:59:48

no, I don't know if it's possible but every bitcoin blockchain parser that I found return a list of addresses for every output.
This list only contains 1 address in the first 20000 blocks and I don't have the rest of the blockchain with me right now, when I get home I will make a script that will parse the whole blockchain looking for such an output

that helps a lot, thanks you :)
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:30:48
this tx has multiple outputs, not multiple addresses per outputs :)
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:30:11
no I'm not talking about a tx having multiple output, but about an output having multiple addresses.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:31:22
I'm not talking about multioutput, I'm taling about an output with multiple addresses.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:55:19
there is indeed an array of outputs, opening at Line 113, but at line 122-124 you can see that each output has an array of addresses.
Yes I'm talking about something different, I get it, a tx can have multiple outputs.
I'm not saying that there is outputs with multiple addresses in the blockchain, but that every parser allows it, since they have array of addresses in every output.
And since they allow it, is there such transactions in the blockchain? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:29:31
According to this librairy (line 55-56), an output can have multiple addresses : 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:29:43
if you look at line 122-124 your piece of code shows that a vout contains a list of addresses, it can be one, but it can be more than one.

now we are talking thanks :D
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:09:55
thank you :D

that does not help me, I get that there is not bitcoins, only record of transaction but what does it do with the private keys? it signs what? it send it to whom? does it mean that at some point it also generated public keys and communicated them to someone else? how are the adresses generated?

I want to be paid in bitcoin, why would I sell them btc to them to give them back to me just after?
 * Client &gt; give 50$ to me
 * ME &gt; give BTC to client
 * CLIENT &gt; give back btc to me
That make no sense.
@_date: 2016-11-15 16:33:37
No I want to tell my futur customers where to buy bitcoins easily
@_date: 2016-11-15 19:04:41
I think you did not understand, this is to be protected of paypal chargeback.
Bitcoin transactions are irreversible so I won't be scammed.
If I sell them BTC then can chargeback with paypal.

I'm guessing I then have to go through the hell of bureacracy in order to pay taxes on it otherwhise they'll come back at me in 10 years with a huge fine :x

@_date: 2016-05-03 08:49:57
well it's running on a quadcore than 4Ghz. don't think it's the CPU.
@_date: 2016-05-03 08:31:36
heh, didn't know you could do that, I'll give it a try tonight
@_date: 2016-05-03 20:13:25
Of course, 2016 dude :p
@_date: 2017-07-06 15:33:44
So I have 1BTC in poloniex right now.
If I send them back to my local wallet and wait I might end up with 1BTC on one chain and 1 BTC on an other chain?
