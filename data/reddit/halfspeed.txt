Anywhere we can bet on the game?

I'm new to bitcoin, if I make a transaction on let's say bitspend, and put in 1 bitcoin. Would I have received $64 in purchasing power or that price at $59? Or is that strictly for traders?

Yeah it became like the top seeded thing on the pirate bay for a while. But still...pissed me off.

Ok, so they would  use market price versus sell price, technically "I am selling them 1 BTC for X dollars" whether or not they update wasn't my issue. Thanks!

I had .07BTC I had just done a transaction so I was pretty happy. But it's still like getting mugged for $10. Learned my lesson, my ewallet with blockchain.info got wiped during the fork as well.

Well, I can't really explain it because I am too new to bitcoin, but my account got wiped. At this point I would use ewallets at all..

Does anyone use diaspora? Is it any good?

But she's hot....

Could you add betting for tournaments for LoL or SC2? That would be insane.
Edit: backcoin seems to have a system for this already.
