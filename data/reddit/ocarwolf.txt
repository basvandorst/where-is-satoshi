Satoshi done goofed then.

No, that's not what I said.
What I said is that it doesn't make sense to put all the hopes of crypto currency in one basket. 
If crypto currency fails, so be it. If they all collapse, that's the end of the grand experiment.
But if bitcoin alone fails, we need to make sure it doesn't drag down and do irreparable damage to the whole concept. 
If the value of 1 btc collapses to 1 penny, businesses will pull support for it. If btc was the only currency accepted, good luck convincing them to give another currency a go. 
On the other hand, if the system already in place allows them to accept other currencies that didn't collapse (let's say 1 ltc was still worth $26 when this happened, they'll likely still keep the system in place.
It's about hedging the risk to the entire idea caused by focusing all of our hopes on BTC.  
I'm not sure how much clearer I can make it. You either support bitcoin or you support an alternative currency. The former doesn't make any sense to me without the latter.  
@_date: 2014-02-14 11:21:30
Bullshit or not, what is malleability?
@_date: 2014-01-12 20:41:17
But if we focus on mass adoption of all crypto currencies now, if bitcoin falls, companies are going to be less likely to pull their crypto currency support. However if they only adopt bitcoin now, and bitcoin falls, they will likely never get back into the crypto currency experiment.
@_date: 2014-06-26 12:50:23
Until this kind of thing can be pared down to b approximately 84% simpler, it's not going to foster main stream adoption. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 16:08:13
Forgive me for my ignorance, but if there is this perpetual risk of  a group getting to 51% and controlling the network (and thus essentially killing BTC), then isn't BTC already dead, absent actual, enforceable safeguards (i.e. not just people's honesty and good will) to protect that? The threat of achievable control is just as good as actually achieved control, once people become educated on this fact.
It seems we'd just be delaying the inevitable. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 15:40:44
Why is the focus exclusively on bitcoin?
Why doesn't a payment processor come out that accepts (and converts to USD) all crypto currencies? 
@_date: 2014-01-13 03:25:41
"We accept bitcoin and other alt currencies!"
"what is bitcoin?"
"Blah blah"
"What is an alt currency"
"Blah blah. 
Seems sufficient to me.
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:03:14
Can someone ELI5 the issues causing this?
Particularly malleability, and why it may or may not be an issue. No idea what that means.
@_date: 2014-06-03 14:26:58
Cryptocurrency in general is great in theory, but until the price of Bitcoin stabilizes and the risk of "taking it over" (or whatever it is this subreddit panics about when a pool gets too large), it's doomed to remain an investment, and not a currency.
@_date: 2014-06-08 12:28:41
I still don't get why people continue to insist Bitcoin will be and should be taken seriously as currency when y'all flip your shit about a pool having too much hashing power every time a pool gets remotely close -- which seems to be about once every month or two.
It's a fatal flaw in Bitcoin, and is part of what dooms it to be a very speculative investment, or a way for big companies to pander to the interwebz and get cheap marketing. 
@_date: 2014-01-12 18:53:36
I'm getting down voted for this, which doesn't make sense to me.
Do we support a single crypto currency at the expense of all, like its a some sports team? Or do we support the idea and reasons behind crypto currency? Widespread adoption of all would serve as a hedge against bitcoin collapsing and taking the whole idea down with it.
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:14:10
I posted this is another thread, and I'd appreciate some education (why I'm -- hopefully -- wrong).
Forgive me for my ignorance, but if there is this perpetual risk of a group getting to 51% and controlling the network (and thus essentially killing BTC), then isn't BTC already dead, absent actual, enforceable safeguards (i.e. not just people's honesty and good will) to protect against that? The threat of achievable control is just as good as actually achieved control in terms of depressing value and acceptance, once people become educated on this fact.
It seems we'd just be delaying the inevitable.
@_date: 2014-01-14 11:44:32
How? It'll tank bitcoin permanently. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 02:21:35
Of course there's limits, but there's no reason to focus exclusively on the adoption of bitcoin rather than having a merchant solution that accepts, say, btc, ltc, peercoin, and maybe a few others. If one of those currencies flops, so be it.
But only accepting btc, which is exceedingly and predictably vulnerable to collapse (51%)...good luck convincing any merchant to accept some of the other currencies out there when it happens. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 11:44:32
This changes nothing about the reality. 
@_date: 2014-06-26 12:43:28
And also that's it's not secure (see weekly: omg everyone join a new pool that one is approaching the 50% megaton), and also that it's not quite yet super intuitive to use, and also that the message about why people should bother with bitcoin has not reached or resonated  with the general public. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 03:08:44
And I'm not disputing this.
But I would prefer sites like overstock partner with a payment processor that automatically converts to USD a variety of coins, rather than exclusively bitcoin. 
This way, the mass adopters of bitcoins can happily spend, and these sites can happily accept bitcoins, but should something happen to bitcoin and people flock elsewhere (even slowly), the show goes on.
And even now it would be nice to give traction to alt currencies by giving them some small type of legitimacy. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:43:23
Also you'd have to trace it back to specific machines, not just find evidence that the company is mining. You'd only need to do this with one or two to get into court. 
@_date: 2013-08-24 03:16:41
Seriously, this company is ripe for being sued into oblivion. 
There have been successful lawsuits over excessive shipping fees, on top of the other shady shit they're doing.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:45:27
This is insane. Wanted to go in and get about 10 coins when it hit 70ish, but I couldn't walk to my bank for the cash transfer that fast! 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:58:12
I am, admittedly, new to bitcoin. Lost some money I could afford to lose speculating. Will buy a bunch more when it drops to $10ish and hope to ride it back up (and it will come back up).
But...isn't the fundamental flaw with Bitcoin is that it goes against what is basically human nature at this point? That is, if Bitcoin is pegged to a more prominent and ubiquitous currency, and people think they can make money on the dramatic rises and falls of Bitcoin, then they're going to care about the price and rush in and speculate and hope to cash out high. 
I get that all the features about it are rah rah awesome amazing and that people shouldn't speculate or pay attention to the price, but people will speculate and will pay attention to the price, more than anything else. And if they continue to do this, then Bitcoin is never going to be stable enough to receive wide adoption.
And after all, the argument that people "shouldn't" speculate or pay attention to the price is more of an appeal to them not to (because doing so corrupts Bitcoin) rather than an argument that it's intrinsically bad for them to do so. Yet the lay person doesn't care much about that, they care about making money. So why would they listen?
@_date: 2013-08-22 14:55:49
So...can someone give me a run down on this?
I get that they are taking orders and not shipping the product or shipping with severe delays, but why don't people just ask for refunds? They're giving refunds, right? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 11:01:41
The problem remains: there are always going to be these dumbasses. If bitcoins success largely depends on dumbasses disappearing or not being dumbasses...it's in trouble.
As for me, I cashed out, but will rebuy when it stabilizes at what seem to be the bottom. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:33:29
You can sell and take a loss (if you bought high) or just ride it out. Might not be the insta profits you hoped, but itll get back up there again at some point. people who bought into the stock market at 11,000 and sold at 8,000 were pretty sad, but those who held are pretty happy now.
@_date: 2013-12-16 03:41:02
If BFL is using preordered rigs to mine and then shipping them out only when they're no longer profitable, it's actionable in court, and people would probably be able to disgorge BFLs profits (aka the bit coins mined from this practice). Violation of consumer protection statutes, and breach of contract, etc. 
I'm a lawyer, and would love to investigate this further, but I have yet to hear anything more than speculation that this is what they're doing. 
Yes, it would make "sense" if they were going to be unethical, but that isn't enough. 
If they're actually doing this, there has to be some way to tell. No scheme is perfect.
Thoughts? Theories? Evidence?
@_date: 2013-04-28 12:05:13
Don't be that guy. Leave a tip in normal currency. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 11:37:45
The issue, I think, would be getting around their asterisks and fine print. It's a challenging case. A straight deceptive practices claim likely isn't big enough ($-wise) to be worth pursuing. High risk low reward.
If we could find a way to show they're mining with the rigs before shipping them out, now that's a more interesting case. You would push for disgorgement of the current value of the raw # of bitcoins they mined, rather than the value at the time of mining. Could get significant. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:28:05
Dust wouldn't be evidence.
There'd need to be something showing how the device was used.
For example, if I wipe my hard drive, I can still go back and recover wiped data, or at least see that there's a significant amount of wiped data. Is it possible to do something similar with these devices?

Reading the whole complaint, I'm almost certain that readandwhite and friendlychemist were the same person, and he scammed DPR out of $150,000.

Question: where is a $224 shipping option? I added to my cart just to see this absurdity, and there was only a $14 standard shipping choice and a couple cloud hosting choices.
@_date: 2013-12-16 03:44:58
Any evidence of advertising a shipping immediately product and not shipping for two months?
@_date: 2013-12-19 01:37:35
Seems extremely difficult to sort the signal from the noise though, assuming they were smarter with their addresses, no?

Sure, but given how rapidly food science seems to change, and how nuanced it can often become, it's really tough to fit the time necessary to become educated on it into a busy working life.
Calories in, some protein, some fats, avoid red meat...that's literally all I would know if I decided to start trying to eat healthy. No more specifics on quantity or anything. Hell, until recently I didn't know any fats were good for you, and still don't entirely know which are and which aren't. 
And I consider myself to be generally well educated.
If someone came up with a food that shortcuts it for me and says this is all you need, it's healthy, enjoy...I'd be all about that. Whether it is Soylent or just some sort of "adult meal plan" that does it is of no matter. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:44:45
Is it possible to discover evidence of this? I don't know the ins and outs of these machines, but there's no way to unearth the history of their use, even if attempts to scrub that history were made?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:35:26
So...who is "they"?
@_date: 2013-08-22 15:15:27
If the product is rolling out the door, but yours hasn't rolled out the door, they're refusing to issue refunds?
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:15:29
If Bitcoin could be stabilized, I could see it being adopted by online merchants just like Paypal was (though I don't ever see widespread physical adoption).
The problem is how do you stabilize it when it's so prone to speculation (and DDoS, and other manipulations, and so on)? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:49:38
Isn't there a chicken egg problem though? Sellers of anything undoubtedly want to make sure that the amount they receive for their goods is going to be roughly the same a week from now with only minor variations. Yet because of bitcoins instability and vulnerability, that wouldn't be the case, so sellers will be hesitant to adopt. How do you stabilize the currency to make sellers comfortable accepting it for legal transactions?
At this point, bitcoin is behaving like a pump and dump penny stock.  
@_date: 2013-08-07 03:18:14
I have no idea what Soylent is, but your arguments boil down to "this might be better than what you're currently doing, but if you educate yourself and take a lot more time in making your choices, you can do even better."
Sure, that might be true, but for the people who work, and may not have time to read about the metabolic spastic colonoscopy of the metaphysical wonder bean and how that may cause cancer if paired with carrots, it seems like it could be a happy middle ground. A shortcut. Maybe it isn't as good as the long way, but that's the sacrifice you make. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:47:16
Long trend is what matters. Watching day to day will just drive you insane.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:20:57
That's true, but again, I only invested money I can afford to lose. I think we're still early, and I think we'll see very similar bubbles over the next couple of years. I might not stay long, but if I can buy in at sub 50 and ride up to 200 again, I'd be perfectly happy.
