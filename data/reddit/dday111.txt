My background is computer networking. Bitcoin full nodes like yours are just to relay txs. Unless you provide work to be able to include those txs into a block, your nodes don't help decentralization. If your node connection is slow, it would also add latency to txs getting to nodes that do the work (sha256 hashing). 
Bitcoin network isn't a mesh network like most bitcoiners believe. It is infact more like a star network by design. There are 2 types of nodes: validator and relay.

How is it a scam?

If you learn how money is created, you would know.... By just having your money in a bank, your money is losing it's value. Your saving interest can barely cover a fraction of the actual inflation.
Most people overlook it because of the convenience. Bitcoin will provide the same convenience as it grows. But now it's still too early and speculation is taking over.

Read my comment above. 
You're  right using bitcoin does not require a relay node. Your mobile wallet or hardware wallet is what you need. In practice you just keep your private key, sign tx and your wallet will pass it to a relay node (with fast connection) and the relay node will send the tx to validating node ( the one that put it to a block). 
So running a relay node does not help in term of decentralization because by design we have enough node server to offer service like ledger wallet...

that's  not true. Your assumption is that the house value will decrease because of deflation. 
Similarly in inflationary economy the house value must increase because of inflation. 
If you think out of the box, the concept of saving is to retain your wealth not to increase it. In inflationary economy you juggles between investment instruments to keep up with inflation. In deflationary, you don't  have to and it actually does not deter you from making investment.

That's  not how the law work. 
If you promote something that is obviously a scam by any reasonable person, you're an accessory of the scam and will be charged equally.

Having a direct connection with the company or not is irrelevant. What is relevant is the intend. His intention was to get referrals  which he gained financial benefits of. As I said, the court will see if such fraud is obvious to any reasonable person and the intention is there. Nothing else matter. 
Youtube as a platform is actually easier for the court being used as evidence . But the law is there before youtube. Financial frauds happened almost everyday.
As for the idiot that does not know what promotion means, I just don't  bother my time with idiot.
