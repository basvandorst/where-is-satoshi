Yes, The easypay to bitcoin is only in smartphone, for the moment.
Taking in account that is a service to be used in front of a cash machine, makes sense. But probably would be included in web soon

You can see whats going on on 
its not about only some one, but a broad network of groups, some of them very legitimitate in social movements, like p2p foundation and Cooperativa Integral Catalana, and also a well known bitcoin group, like dark wallet
Some media attention:  
  
And  its already up, with people registering every hour...
And here you have the road map:

The Coop has been funded with a donation of the 20% of the money supply of faircoin bought on Mintpal.  To be used as a capital to fund social projects. 
About 60.000 dollars today and perhaps one of the biggest donations in an altcoin
– 5,000,000 faircoins for the Global South fund (address:  )
– 2,500,000 faircoins for the Commons fund (address:  )
– 1,500,000 faircoins for the Technology Infrastructure fund (address:  )
– 1,000,000 faircoins for the Pooled fund (address:  )

Certainly nobody have a crystall ball about what the future is. And no project have a 100% of possibility to be succesful. This said, our background is an important chart of presentation to get people to be involved together: 
We have a lot of experience in cooperative and collective process, and in social movements, and this could be a key to be succesful where others has fail
Otherwise this is false: "a crypto that you premined"  
we bought during weeks the 20% of the supply to prepare the project.. This is an irrefutable proof of our commitment

Chosed by the  as the cryptocurrency upon which to base its resource-redistribution actions and building of a new global economic system.

Thats one of the reasons why faircoin matters, with the long term plan to redistribute funds to community projects around the world:

Thats why he is deleting things:
He is the Senior vicepresident of Center for Strategic Cyberspace and Security Science (CSCSS)  (Well in his blog he says, he was, but in the official site, it says he is..) See also: 
His publical function at CSCSS is: "with a focus on collaborating government bodies in securing cyber systems" So in other words he is a trainer of Inteligency Agencies in CyberCrime.. 
Look here how an event of CSCSS, looks like: 
And this is one article from Craig Wright at 2012, as a cybercrime recognized especialist
And he was writing articles about cybercrime as an expert at 2011

Connected to that is easy to see that Craig Wright is linked to CIA and other inteligency bodies.

Many of us thought that Bitcoin was created for recovering the power to the people, to manage money sovereignty, and be free from central banks and governments. 
Just this links shows how Craig Wright's worked at same time that bitcoin was created just in the opposite: For making central powers strongers which inteligency systems to control the people, and for example control the people who use bitcoin.
So, his job experience is not coherent with that goal and helps the community to think that not makes sense, he created bitcoin
@_date: 2016-05-04 09:49:34
So, how is that the official sites of that intelligency organizations count with him ?
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:13:28
