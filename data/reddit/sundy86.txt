So here is my opinion as a Bulgarian citizen. Can you imagine a person or persons having such a huge amount of Bitcoins to leave them unsecure - open wallet on notebook or when they had arrested them to give to the police passphrase or private keys? After that can you imagine how the police officers will keep these keys safe and untouched? They were at least 5 persons risponsible for the operations. After that they should report to their bosses. Finally who has the keys? Just think about that. Since the accident there are not any local news for this amount of Bitcoins (tv or internet). This is only speculation even we are corrupted nation I cant imagine how they would handle with such a big treasure and why they didnt touch even a single Bitcoin since then? Sorry for my bad english... Just my 50 sats.

Good job Sir

Whats the deal with them? 
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:43:33
Why someone IF can generate your key will provide that key to you for small reward instead keep all the funds :) 
@_date: 2019-03-29 16:02:25
Bills, burgers and Bitcoins will aways exist
@_date: 2019-03-03 13:45:16
Please NO, there is only Bitcoin and only one symbol.

Hello, Exodus is nice looking and easy to use pc wallet. If you want a mobile you can try Samoirai wallet. Be carefull from scam and phishing sites. Good luck.

Pump it

Congrats, keep hodling! Im 27 and had small crypto amounts. My big stack is BTC and will keep it for my old ages and retirement. Only for online payments not for fiat!!! Be safe and move your funds to better wallet. Also it is not a good idea to store your keys in your backyard, someone could see you digging or can see spots from digging.

There is no such thing like a best wallet, best phone, best car, etc. The leaders are ledger and trezor. You can see many reviews of them in youtube. Im using ledger nano s and Im very satisfied from it.

I think the richest BTC adress is on Satoshi? Or wrong? 
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:44:05
This wallet is one of the best on the market. Dont worry that is on beta. It has many security options and nice design. Just download it and see the differences. Highly recommend.

The odds would be better if you play with lottery tickets instead changing 2 words :) 
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:04:19
Download Jaxx wallet and recover your wallet with the 12 words and see the balance again.

This is the real BTC JESUS. He is smart and honest, he deserves our support and love. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:55:40
How I can download it? 
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:37:37
Can someone explain me why there are people doing this? To go out with your hardware wallet and backup seed together? Isn't it the same to go out with your debit card and pin code together? WoW
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:57:48
Nobody knows for sure, there are more than 100 years to mine the last block :)
Also there is huge possibility all of us not to see the last blocks :D
@_date: 2018-07-20 14:58:34
Wow how I can download it? 
@_date: 2018-03-01 07:35:50
Did you write your 12word backphrase? 
@_date: 2018-07-24 07:18:07
Great news!

The hashrate is rising for the past weeks and you are concerned about it after 600days? What do you think about the future asic miners which would be produced? 
@_date: 2018-07-20 15:08:36

@_date: 2018-07-20 16:31:17
10x mate, but no result... 
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:57:13
Well I think Bitstamp is the best way for you, but you must verify your account first, also it is UK based exchange. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:09:15
Sorry for the question, but what is the purpose of these words? 
@_date: 2018-04-17 05:54:45
If BTC is on PoS Lighting would be useless 
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:32:51
They are taking some profits, be carefull the Tether drama isnt over, Im expecting huge dump.
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:35:12
One of the greatest posts explaining what is Bitcoin and what is Bitcoin cash and why there is only one King  Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-25 08:04:12
Wait wait the fees of using BCH is just a fraction of a penny ��
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:45:38
The most important lesson which I learned for the past years in crypto is - buy and hodl. You must choose a proper way to store your Bitcoins also. Take a look for paper wallet like a bitadress.org or hardware wallet like ledger/trezor. In youtube there are plenty of reviews. KEEP HODLING. Every single day is a good time to buy Bitcoin.
