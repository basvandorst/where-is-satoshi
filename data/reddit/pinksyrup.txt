Ah okay, thanks for clarifying
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:46:23
You're so right king! Can't wait to lose all my money
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:33:58
Do you have any reason why or just spouting stuff
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:30:40
They can't really go to 0, I think it would be more like 4 years down the line if they DID fall significantly
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:41:29
Oh other people can make alt coins, who knew
@_date: 2017-10-13 09:25:13
that's what I was asking my man
@_date: 2017-10-17 21:41:09
Buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:44:14
Buy now
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:35:35
$ doesn't always mean functionality, I'm actually thinking of buying a swatch because I don't like wearing my Breitling chronography out the house.
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:49:33
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:45:41
Uhhhh, and how do I do this LOL
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:41:07
How much are you making hourly?
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:04:32
I'm a bit confused, I want to buy £1000 worth of bitcoin and I'm looking at localbitcoin and it's all a bit confusing :c
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:24:16
How much % do you end up losing
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:36:34
No what?
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:39:48
This is not just any asset!
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:44:45
Why isn't that possible? Lol
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:33:19
A lot of Wall Street CEOs wear Swatches worth about $80, fun fact
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:27:59
Cash I guess?
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:11:59
I think it's less of a risk than marriage
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:08:15
Thanks, I knew it wasn't a bad idea, I'm only 21 and losing my money doesn't mean much considering I'm a recovering gambling addict, also, how do you store your bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-18 21:45:15
I'd put it on and hodl if you have no expenses
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:49:34
Any validity at this? Or just throwing it out there
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:40:43
I have a lot of faith in bitcoin and I've been broke many times before, investing in bitcoin gives me the buzz I get from gambling without actually worrying about losing it all at once, good stuff
@_date: 2017-10-16 07:09:59
Probably just get wallets on your phone?
@_date: 2017-10-17 08:29:32
Looks pretty cool, I'm hodling atm tho
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:23:42
I actually hooked up with an old buddy who I would have thought would NEVER be into bit coin, he likes drugs and girls etc, anyway I told him to invest in bitcoin and he said he already had an exodus wallet, weird how the world works, bitcoin to 10k btw
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:50:30
So it's basically a bot that makes you sure you buy low and sell high or what not, is this allowed?
@_date: 2017-10-17 12:00:44
It worked for me
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:36:55
100% of my portfolio is going in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-14 18:40:48
Unless your net worth is on bitcoin in the first place :)
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:35:22
I assume if you do it in cash the only fee will be the one bitcoin charges
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:28:08
You have more faith in humanity than me
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:44:08
% daily? On average
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:49:27
Hope so
@_date: 2017-10-16 07:11:54
He's still isolated, no?
@_date: 2017-10-22 16:40:16
Can't you get a few community service hours instead? Also how much is it you need to pay? And how long would you go to jail for if you violated
