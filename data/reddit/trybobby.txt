Well, in 2017, we have been plagued by bcash claiming to be "Satoshi's one true vision" after bitcoin's refusal to increase the block size, instead opting for segregated witness and off-chain transactions. 
Satoshi understood that there would be a need for various transaction types if Bitcoin adoption increased. He knew that nothing was set in stone. 
I think this is particularly important for those entering the Bitcoin space in 2017, so that they can ignore some of the FUD being peddled.

I think the problem starts with the fact that the fiat currency that is going into that bank account is devalued year on year.
That money is not owned by you, and if the bank goes under, or there is am economic crash, you lose everything.
While bitcoin is currently extremely volatile, that volatility is becomes less and less sever as it grows. Bitcoin, while not deflationary, it looks to be deflationary in nature.
My concern for the poorest of the poor stems from a distrust of the current financial system. Those are often the hardest hit by poor political decisions when it comes to monetary policy.

We have a unique issue where network coverage is governed by an oligopoly (3/4 big companies). We have limited data spectrum available, which means data costs are artificially high, to keep people off the network.
It's a governance issue unfortunately.

It's the hard fork. It's causing a lot of worry and concern on the market.
