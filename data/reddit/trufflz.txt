Not sure how that's relevant; it's a two-way machine that allows for buy-and-sell. I'll let you know which machine and who owns it if they don't get back to me this evening. It's already bordering on less-than-timely.

 I appreciate your well-wishes. As it stands, I am growing increasingly discontent with the pace in which this is dealt with. I suggested to a staff member at the pub that they perhaps leave an "out of order" sign on the machine and his response was less than courteous.

The details are in the OP, Moriarty. Why not just address the string of e-mails posted above?

...still waiting.

I have dealt with them before, yes. My experience has been similar to yours, however, I have been trying to get a hold of them for the better part of a year.
Here is a link to my reddit post from December 4th, 2018. 
Oh and here's a post from December 11th, 2017 detailing another person having the exact same issue.
and here's a post I made on the forums that they link to on their website.
All's quiet in there, mostly.
I have sent them at least half a dozen e-mails since November 2011 as well as sent an e-mail to their parent company. No reply from anyone. I even translated one of my support request e-mails to German!
Sorry to say, but I have no idea how to escalate this any further. Hopefully someone can offer us some advice. This is shady as hell.

The suggestion is opportune.

Hey all, OP here.
Can I get some advice on how to deal with this situation? All I want to do is transfer the funds to another wallet.
Bitcoin.de STILL has yet to respond to my many, many e-mails. It's been about two months already and I'm starting to feel like something fishy is happening here.

but think of what investing that $0.56 right now could mean in five years!

Still have yet to receive a response. How disheartening.
@_date: 2018-12-01 00:42:39
That's a solid return, man

I'm not really quite sure what to do at this point. I have yet to receive a reply. I'm wondering if I should find a contact for the parent company.
