Can confirm, have spent most of my working life getting paid in bitcoin, not fiat. Never really been an investor, rather been an employee.
Can’t eat bitcoins, but you can trade bitcoins for goods and services

Basically you'd have to block American IP addresses like other bitcoin gambling websites do, but if you do that you could totally start a bitcoin gambling website.
