What about [bctip.org]( It generates printable tips with unique URLs which can be emailed. Important feature is expiration time. If recipient doesn't activate tip within a month, then coins are going back to you. Here few as [image]( or [link](

You can try  It generates printable tips, but you can easily send URL of one of the tip. The good thing is it returns coins to your address if tip will not be activated within 1 month.

Guys, we are here to expand the community. I've implemented my idea and show it to the world. Sure, the safest way is DIY, but who want to bother? I don't mind if someone make similar service - it is all good for bitcoin future.

I have not used my real credentials to minimize the government influence.
Bitcointalk account was registered on May 16, 2011, so you can trust a little in advance. I hope more people will use tips, so reddit and bitcoin forum give some type of assurance.
P.S.  you can redeem your own tips by yourself anytime before expiration period, so the trust can be minimal

I can't implement zero-trust model because it disables "funds back to the owner after expiration" feature. And I am unable to profit with lost or forgotten coins thanks to the same reason "funds back to the owner after expiration".
