It’s weird here on one hand because of the evil intent op seems to attribute to the group of “females”. Not all usage is inappropriate but it gives a weird gut feeling when it is.

OMG this is great... tbh its worth it when the price dips just for the memes!

Like a week ago it was $15K (against AUD sorry I dont watch USD), and before that it dipped to $11K. Now its at $10K AUD... I mean you could sell now since you would still make an amazing profit, but I think I would wait it out and sell when it bounces back. Coz its going to. Just like last time.

The baby boomers I work for and work along side are only just beginning to talk about it and ask questions. The baby boomers hold most of the money and are looking for ways to spend it. They are the ones bank rolling shoddy app ideas and stuff. I am sure they will start to get interested once enough of their kids explain the basics to them.

There is a certain something about inappropriately using the word “females” that that makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up and my stomach turn. It’s weird being spoken about like the enemy just cos we don’t have a dangly bit. Reminds me of r/incels

Its been just days since it was nearly $15K AUD. Many are really over reacting, and need to calm down. Or not, coz it is entertaining.

Ew he is a TD subber and a pedophile wanna be according to his very recent post history.

Ps you called for the legal age to be lowered equating it somehow with voting, please explain the connection other than you wishing there was one? Genuine question.

I am Australian, Einstein. I support putting you down is all.
Do you really think the law is the only thing stopping little girls from sleeping with you? The age of consent will still require consent you gross toad. Eeeeeew.
