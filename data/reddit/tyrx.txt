Of course they will have fees... the cost of purchasing coins will simply be hidden through inflated fiat to bitcoin prices. They're kinda replicating what banks do with foreign currency exchanges - set prices below current market rates and skimp on the difference.

I wouldn't trust this "campaign" very much... In their original IMAM they had the flag of a popular Western Ukrainian neo-nazi organization called Svoboda in the background. There's literally no reason why any Eastern Ukrainian would be using this flag, and they would probably be mobbed by the locals if they did...
They've since deleted (?) it, but haven't offered up any explanation as to why it was there in the first place.

Please enlighten me as to how I've been "trolling" with my comments, rather than restorting to ad-hominem attacks with little substance...

What? My comment history doesn't even imply I'm anti-Russian... In-fact, it's quite the opposite. Interesting guess with the age though, and that link goes to my post history, not my comment history.

I'd wager to say ALL bitcoin gambling sites are rigged beyond belief simply because they don't have to answer to federal regulation. Don't take this as a suggestion that -real- (physical) gambling organizations are fair though, that's actually quite the contrary - but at least the government keeps an eye on them.

I'm not defending the stance that the teacher took here, but the wording of his actual document is awful. It sounds like something out of a get-rich quick scheme, and that's possibly why the teacher said it wasn't "age appropriate". Enthusiasm is good, but to someone that doesn't know much about bitcoins, this document would seem like you were trying to manipulate people for your own reasons. 
I'm not sure what to make of the last comments the teacher made, but the OP could be over-exaggerating or misinterpreting the situation. Let's put down the pitchforks for a moment and consider that this isn't as clear-cut as others are making it out to be.

You must be a pretty sad person to spend your entire day trolling @_date: 2013-12-21 09:12:36
They reversed the transaction because they were told that it was unauthorized... "however the transfer was unauthorized". This whole story seems fishy anyway, and from the comments you're posting it looks like you simply want sympathy donations.

I'd like to help test this site out, but the first tip I can give is that the site doesn't really convoy that your service is legitimate. Looks like something that somebody has quickly whipped up in frontpage in a few minutes.

I'm not so sure about the safety of this product. The people that own the product seem to have gone to long lengths to attempt to hide their identity. All their domain contact information is hidden behind Domains By Proxy, which is designed to stop people find out personal data of the domain register. I also don't see any business information on their homepage, which makes this more strange. 
I'm bit coin poor like many on this subreddit, but should we really be so eager to install third-party coins on our computers for free bitcoins? If they were more upfront about who they were, I'd willing to do this.

It has nothing to do with idealism. Most people in this subreddit are speculators who jump at any chance to promote the idea of purchasing of bitcoins. They're in it to make money, and as such they will always tell people to buy as it helps boost the price of bitcoins.

I can already see vast amounts of children getting told off by their parents for trying to mine bitcoins. Speaking of that point, it's a safe assumption to assume that bitcoins will have lots of bad press about technophobic parents being unaware that their children are massively raising the house electricity bill.
The only problem I have with minors having access to bitcoins is the fact that it's far too easy for the currency to be used in idiotic ways at the moment. We all know that children do stupid shit, so there's going to be an enormous problem with the ease of access to bitcoin gambling sites.

The entire bitcoin system is a double edged blade due to transactions being irreversible. If the comments above are true, and somebody really has redeemed this code for bitcoins, I doubt MTGox will give you money out of their own pockets.
