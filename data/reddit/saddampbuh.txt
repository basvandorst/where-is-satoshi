there are no taxes to report unless you cash out for dollars, the idea of cashing out to become fiat rich is equally as against bitcoin's mission but that's what most of you think about

even if you get it to show as sent you'll probably get "unable to broadcast transaction" after a couple of hours and when you reload your wallet the coins will show back up

this "when the asians wake up" malarkey always pops up when the price goes down as something you tell yourselves to feel better. multi millionaire day traders with the power to move markets didn't get to where they are by caring about timezones and office hours.

btc has a better chance of success than the roulette wheel, if you are certain she's going to leave you you are doing the right thing, all you're going to lose is your credit rating, sometimes we take every decision correctly and still lose due to circumstances we can't control, that doesn't mean we were wrong.

i don't convert btc to fiat so there's nothing for me to cope with

i bought in at 800+ in 2013 when i was poor as hell, watched as it lost 80% of its value over the next year, managed to get my average price down to about 600 by mining alts and converting to btc which still sucked, held all the way through the downturn while being ridiculed etc, now you're telling me what? that some of my coins should be redistributed to you? i bought in at a price that hurt and caused me great worry and stress, and if you want the kind of returns i'm seeing after 4 years i'm afraid you're going to have to do the same.

stress about what? the answer is not to sell your btc for fiat. everyone who has ever sold btc up until now has lost out.

they are most regulated and audited exchange, incompetent and slow but not scammers, used them since 4 years

i get that all most people are in btc for is to make money but why bother with btc if your intention is to sell 500 bucks worth for "a little higher" than the price you paid and walk away with a day's mcdonalds wages as profit? seems like a lot of hassle to go through and would have been less effort to have worked the extra day at mcdonalds.

you can send on low priority setting for 10 bucks with other wallets, never heard of exodus wallet before but found this on their website
"If being able to manually set a low fee is important to you, Exodus is not a good software choice and we encourage you to use other bitcoin wallets."

more like 0.01%

don't cash out. you won't be able to live with yourself when it hits 100k.

happened to me in late 2017. sent from mycelium with recommended fee which was too low during all the hype. transaction showed as unconfirmed. coins showed back up in my waller the next day. it will confirm eventually or show back up in your wallet as if the transaction never happened. you won't lose the coins.

people didn't want to give the government half of their income and did something about it, shock horror
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:05:23
we've all been there, bought in 2013 near the top, watched it lose 80% of its value and stay there for ages and now look at things, don't worry about it

those shouting the loudest about how others aren't contributing enough tend to be net recipients of government spending which is to say they use up more in services and welfare than they will ever put in. in the usa 45% of households pay no income tax. in the uk someone on minimum wage pays about £1.5k per year. do these people really have any business complaining that someone who made 10 million "only" paid a few hundred thousand in taxes?
