I'm arguing that bitcoin needs a blocksize increase and that makes me a bch shill? Solid logic. 


You can easily run your useless full node with a 2 mb blocksize. It's been proven running a full node is not an indicator of bitcoin decentralization. The majority of the world can't afford to use bitcoin and you're worrying you cant run a full node... LOOOOL
Just saw this comment by you:


if Bitcoin is going to crash
not much
    if Lightning Network will fix the scaling problem
    if high fees will kill Bitcoin
    if Bitcoin will become digital gold
already is
    if Bitcoin will become digital cash
already was, and will be again on lightning network layer
    if we're in a bubble
there's always some correction, short term
    if Bitcoin is just so different that it's actual value is actually rising exponentially
yes (long term)
I'm done arguing with a retard that thinks they can predict the future ^^^^

segwit will only lower these fees by half. It won't solve anything....... The fees will still be more then what we were seeing a year a go.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:56:29
I can think of a recent fork that solved those problems. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:05:03
No it's not. no one could use it for commerce even with half fees. If bitcoin keeps growing in a couple months the fees will double again...

This can't be argued. Satoshi designed bitcoin to be scalable well past 1 mb blocks. Bitcoin cash proved Bitcoin can run fine with 8 mb blocks and that would drastically relieve the current network.


it's in alpha mode that means nothing. I'm patient but the industry isn't. They are slowly switching to accepting alts over bitcoin. Everyday this problem persists bitcoin loses control over crypto


oh god I had no idea people still bought into the network being flooded with useless transaction propaganda. losing faith daily in bitcoin by reading r/bitcoin and seeing how dumb the users are

Your argument makes no sense for what I said. transactions were faster and cheaper. that's like using high speed internet in the 90s then switching to dial up and getting charged 100X more. 
LN leads to centralization and has been delayed for ages now. The fact that there's no other scaling solutions for bitcoin in the horizon scares me.

Are you seriously trying to argue that a blocksize increase won't make bitcoin exponentially faster and cheaper to use vs 1 mb blocks? Bitcoin cash would operate cheaper/faster then bitcoin at its current state and thats why we need a blocksize increase 


This analogy doesn't work at all for the blocksize debate. Lets say it did: 1 mb , 2mb block size increase, 4 mb block size increase, 8 mb block size increase, 16mb 32mb etc etc. there's your exponential solution 


you havn't been using bitcoin very long have you


Even if everyone used a segwit wallet it wouldn't solve the current problem. Transaction fees would be 50% but it would still be 5000%-10000% times higher then what it should be.

That's an opinion not a fact
This argument is equivalent to: lets only have 1 stick of ram and program more efficient code and never upgrade the ram only try to upgrade the code........ I wonder what amazing software we could've been using on our 2gb of ram computers.
Or another example. Keep using dial up internet but compress the packets more efficiently. Why bother increasing internet speeds? 


You don't need dev experience to know a product in alpha mode might not even be released let alone know the release date 
How much would it cost to spam a bunch of 1s/b transactions hmmmmmmmmmmmm
Quote from twitter


I see no sign of a spam attack. Sorry to break it to you but people using bitcoin ≠ spam attack no matter how blockstream tries to sugar coat it to you. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:57:54
That's terribly slow, I used to be able to send bitcoin for a fraction of a cent and it would arrive in seconds. It's impossible to use for everyday transactions at that speed.

LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL. Is that supposed to be showing how fast bitcoin is?
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:22:50
LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL. You're fucking dumb if you believe that's the case. The only reason they cancelled it was because they came to a mutual agreement with blockstream. Lets say the fork went through. The miners wouldn't have lost any profits because u/metalzip chose to not transact his couple of $. 
Side note: lets go with your idea that users are what stopped the fork. We stopped the 2mb blocks now bitcoin is unusable.... yay. fucking lol at you 
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:36:25
No one is the master. Technically users need miners more. There would be no bitcoin without miners. Miners are the only ones that get to vote on forks...

You're comparing a 1 mb block to a 2mb. it can be increased far more then that. If LN would be ready in the next couple months then yes great solution. However at this rate it won;t be ready for years and no one will be using bitcoin by the time it's implanted.


By the time we need 32 mb blocks data storage and transmission would upgrade. You don't need to run your node, it's been proven over and over a users ability to run their own node isn't the decentrilaztion bitcoin is striving for. Look at you caring about who can run a full node when the majority of the world can't even use bitcoin right now because of the fees, fucking lol.


I've been hearing about how LN is going to come out soon for years now. Bitcoin can't afford to wait any longer for a solution


A blocksize increase is something that can be implanted quickly and safely now and solve all of bitcoin problems for the foreseeable future while LN develops.....
