The guy sounds like a pretentious dick, overcompensating for the fact that he found himself lecturing on this "legitimate scientific study" of fucks in a fuckin' *bar*. I'd probably be a dick if I couldn't even get a hotel conference room to rent the space for a few hours' lecture. Screw that guy, I'd focus more on the kids who were interested. Talk to the bartender or the manager and see if you could request a time to come in and do your own lecture. The kids would come. You got the upcoming generation of technology interested in bitcoin? That's a win.

This is potentially a revolutionary theory, wow. Glad to see it's getting plenty of attention. I'm oddly inspired to care for all of my energy-releasing belongings with the gentleness I would an infant. Haha, this is an awesome article, thanks for sharing!

Awesome inspiration. Bring on 2015! but first, Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, and please stay safe over the holidays!

I'm pretty new to bitcoin...heard about it a while back, just started trying to collect. trying to get a handle on how worth it it is. so you're saying that you don't know how exactly bitcoin will fair in the move to the mainstream, but you seem to have an idea that it can't be a bad thing!
@_date: 2014-12-25 12:49:27
thank you love :)
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:53:54
what are "hodlers," if that's not a dumb question. and what do you think would be the best way to go about attaining bitcoin without investing?
@_date: 2014-12-21 16:27:10
This is unconvincing.

Excuse me, Sir. I believe you meant to say, "your, not you're**.**"

This feels like the exact moment to finally apply a lesson from the fourth grade.
"People tend to think things are stupid when they can't understand."

You, Sir,
are a gentleman and a scholar.

Just to clarify as to the purpose of this crowdfund, the funds donated to this particular fund are to be used for Chris' medical treatment solely. Of course, in turn, we are supporting a healthy, stronger Chris who very well may end up spitting out fullnodes like a conveyer belt given the proper care. There have been other crowdfunds that were specifically to pay for the cost of the full node material, getting them pledged to enthusiastic individuals in underdeveloped countries, and these purposes alone. Chris pays himself under 3 dollars per hour that he works on these nodes. Everything he does is 100% transparent, open-source for all to see. His fullnode project has been an absolute revolution in the adoption of both bitcoin and the technology we need in order to continue supporting it. This time around, we need a little help getting the man behind the whole thing the medical care that he needs, and absolutely more than deserves.

If I could upvote you any harder, I would. Thank you on behalf of the community suffering, silenced by the misguided judgements of those who prefer to draw assumptions over educating themselves and understanding.

Unfortunately, simple tinnitus is not the worst of Chris' ailment. If you check out the indiegogo crowdfund, you can find a more detailed description of his condition, including a CT scan of his brain and a dropbox containing his latest medical testing. Even with his personal medical information, the guy is 100% open source. Way too cool a dude.

Oh, I'm so sorry to hear about your daughter struggling at such a young age - and I know how incredibly frustrating and disheartening it is for the parents of a sick child. It can be a helpless feeling. I hope to draw more awareness to this community of the sick and suffering as well as the suffering of the caretakers involved. I hope to begin to change the paradigm here so that people like Chris and your daughter and myself even are able to focus on the best interest of our health and not be afraid to do so because of stigmas and misunderstanding. Hopefully Chris' story itself will help.

Not seeing any mental health causes here unless I'm just missing it, so will be looking into one that may possibly accept bitcoin. We need research in the mental health department desperately!

Compulsive Tipping Disorder.
See: [Velociralex clinical definition](
we could create a foundation for him, donate to this affliction, but this may further enable his CTD, causing chaotic tipping sprees...
