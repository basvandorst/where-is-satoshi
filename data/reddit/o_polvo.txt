Forks seem to be adding value to the network. This is very counterintuitive but that seems to be the world we live now. Maybe there’s some innate quality to BTC that allows for this to happen. Differently from ETH, that took a pretty big hit before and after its fork.

I guess the idea here was that some people just abandon rationality and make huge mistakes out of greed/envy when they see friends getting rich (ICOs are a good example). People want to jump on the bandwagon for pure FOMO. This quote is from Charles Kindleberger "Manias, Panics and Crashes", a financial literature classic

This argument makes no sense at all. It’s a shitty reason for small blocks, based on some white guilt about “the poor people in Venezuela”. It’s absolutely irrelevant for Bitcoin development, usability and scalability. Mining is not supposed to be maximized for charity. Running nodes is not supposed to be maximized for charity.
PS: I live in Venezuela. Block size is the least of our problems. It’s insane that so many people make this argument and pose as saviors, while helping (intentionally or not) an agenda that keeps bitcoin unusable for transactions. You are helping neither Venezuelans or Bitcoin.

Who the hell cares? Apple built personal computers, Netflix delivered DVDs by mail, Amazon was a online bookstore. Projects, companies, countries and species evolve in ways that simply cannot be predicted. I think Satoshi is/was brilliant guy (or guys, or girl, or rhinoceros) but I don’t think he had a crystal ball. Bitcoin is evolving. We are still in the process of understanding use cases and “killer apps”. The constant talk about the Messias vision does not do us any good, because it substitutes rational, fact-based discussion for religious-like scripture interpretation.

Any initiatives to expand the internet? Other than Google and FB...

You READ The Whitepaper? I feel it in my heart. I named my children after the solutions in The Calculations. No wonder this community is losing its values.

What do they do exactly? Not much information on the website.

Most ppl don’t want the responsibility of having full control over their own money. It scares them. They rather have a large institution they feel they could go after in case something happens to their funds. For them it’s the way things have been for a long time and, “fuck, if it’s right for the richest people in the world, why not for me?”
This line only works for millennials who just started to see some money going in and still have somewhat “plastic” perception of this relationship, so they can feel comfortable having full control. Hard to convince even tech-savvy older rich dudes.

Yep let’s forget about the market, it can be pretty dumb. Let’s trust enlightened leaders who will provide all the correct answers. That’s why Venezuela is in such great shape and the USSR is the only remaining superpower.

Forking is the new ICO
