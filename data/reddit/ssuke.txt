I haven't used Coinbase in years, and I remember them being well-liked then. What's changed?

Why would you switch to Robinhood instead of away from Robinhood? Are lower fees that important to you?

Square Cash is better than Venmo, Google Wallet, and PayPal.
But there's a limit of $2500 in transactions per week, which makes it useless for businesses, larger transactions, and recurring transactions.
And it only works with certain fiat currencies instead of cryptocurrency.
Edit: It looks like Square Cash is also available for businesses with no monthly transaction limit, but they have to pay 1.5% per transaction.

Ok. If you could weather a long-term investment, I suppose it wasn't that risky for you after all.
And you make a good point about stocks. The current bull market is somewhat reminiscent of the year 2000 market. I don't know when it's going to correct, but it's kind of scary thinking about it.

IMO, you're just as crazy as the kids in You took a risky gamble and got lucky. What's even riskier is that you encouraged others to do it as well, and your tactics are similar to those of MLM groups. One of the big reasons Bitcoin climbed 2015-2017 was because market manipulators were pumping its value. If it hadn't recovered, you might be out of money and those friends.
It doesn't sound like you took a calculated risk. Did you hedge at all?

I mean why did you leave traditional stock brokers 2 years ago? The crypto announcement was just today. Robinhood's transactions are slow.

What qualifies as an "exchange"? I thought it's any system in which you can change currencies.

What makes you think Coinbase is any safer?

What surcharge? Is this a foreign thing?
At least in the US, there is no surcharge for paying with my CC, and I get a 1-5% cashback bonus.
For Bitcoins, I usually have to pay a small fee to convert my USD to Bitcoins (1%). From a financial perspective, merchants would have to offer me a 2% discount for me to even consider switching to paying in Bitcoins. Fortunately, there are many merchants who are already giving these discounts.

I wouldn't consider less than 10% a crash.

Well, everyone ends up subsidizing for that surcharge regardless of payment type. If I only cared about my own expenditures, I would continue using my credit card.

They don't exist generally, but sometimes individual companies will open themselves up to smaller investments. Last week, Fundrise allowed its users to start investing in its company pre-IPO: 
It's quite similar to the Angel funding that requires $250K.
