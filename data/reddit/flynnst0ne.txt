Volatility may improve over time, however speed and fees are still prohibitive for mass adoption

Bill Gates comment is telling...
"Bitcoin won’t be the dominant system. When you talk about a domestic economy, [you must have] the idea of attributed transactions, where if you sent it to the wrong person you can actually get the transaction reversed. [And a traditional system] doesn’t have this huge fluctuation where the value of your account is going up and down by a factor of two. We need things that draw on the revolution of Bitcoin, but Bitcoin alone is not good enough." -Bill Gates

Thank you for the response.  
I’ve been attempting to come up with a frictionless way for Customers to pay (who may not necessarily be familiar with the traditional ways of purchasing crypto)...but i guess the payment card fraud makes element sense.
I found a solution called BestRate.Org, which seems to do what I’m wanting, but i haven’t found a whole lot about their offering

This is no longer an option, as all domestic banks/processors 
 will no longer allow visa/MasterCard for the purchase of CBD products.  
I was trying to identify a workaround which still allows me to accept Visa/MC, while-remaining compliant with current banking policies

Yes, that would work as well.  I just need a solution which allows  customers to still use their credit cards.
