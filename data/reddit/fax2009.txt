So my simplified calculation could go as follows?
100 Mio Lightning Transactions / year (with SegWit)
x 1.25 with Schnorr (
x 1.1 for batching (
=140 Mio Lightning Transactions / year 
divided by two for closing/opening once a year by each user
= 70 Mio Users 
x 10 for channel factories (
= 700 Mio Users which could use the Bitcoin Network for an unlimited amount of transactions (without depending on a second blockchain/sidechain which might add the factor 10-100 again).

Thanks! My concern was that streaming money would force the end user to continuely confirm transactions. (I imagined pressing a TREZOR all the time while on the web :D) But I guess there will be neat tricks under the surface of browsers handling those handshakes with the servers...

Thanks! I will research those two :)

Multiple wallets support batching (sending to multiple addresses at once). But is it also possible to aggregate transactions from multiple private keys into one transaction? Example: Two accounts on a TREZOR - both non-segwit. I would like to send the bitcoin to two new segwit adresses. THX

Another idea might be to use a fund to recompense developers for each commit to the github repo...

I already am. Though all of the plugins I came across so far seem to make me dependent on a third party service.

Damn! That's exactly what I have been looking for! Thank you very much :)

I'd rather keep them. But probably that will create some legal issues with taxes...
