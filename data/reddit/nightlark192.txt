Looks like for the US, first-class international postage is $1.15 for sending to 180 countries out of ~195 countries. Says that flats can be valued up to $400, but I doubt anyone is checking.
As of now, bitcoin transaction fees are $26 compared to the $1.15 for sending an envelope with cash, so assuming you stick to the max value the US postal service lists, you'd need to be transferring around $9000 before the cost of the bitcoin transaction fee breaks even with $400 letters.

You're a real charmer.

You're making the assumption that the trends will continue. No guarantees that the USD will keep going down in value (but highly likely), however the likelihood of Bitcoin continuing to go up in value is even lower (it is a gamble, even if cryptocurrencies are the way of the future, any one of the competing altcoins could overtake Bitcoin). Also way less price data for the 'Bitcoin going up' trend than for the 'USD going down' trend.

Or just sell 3/4 of your bitcoins now and retire now — just in case it crashes.

Would be interesting to see how many are tradibg their altcoins for bitcoin — it feels like the altcoins have in general been dropping since this giant rise in bitcoin price.

From what I've read about it, the fees are basically zero until it touches the block chain -- which would either result in a large decrease in the number of miners, or high transaction fees for the few times the block chain is used for a transaction. Great for users buying and selling stuff, but if the number of "miners" (not really, once all bitcoin are mined) is too low then you lose the security of a large network (which is probably way too big at the moment).
I guess there is some money to be made by running a lightning network node, but it sounds like the per transaction fee is very small, so I imagine profit would be low unless someone is able to gain a large number of transactions routed through their node.
If you found a good write up that that presents an alternate point of view, then post a link.

Bitcoin futures.

But if hardly any transactions need to touch the blockchain, wouldn’t that make all the farms significantly less profitable in terms of transaction fees earned (once all bitcoins are mined)?

Are there still transaction fees for using the lightning network, or only when it touches the blockchain?

Everyone who learned of it at thanksgiving bought with credit cards and is HODLing while the cc bill is accumulating interest, but gains are outpacing the interest so they aren’t paying off the debt.

Keep dreaming and cash out some of your bitcoin now. Will be amazing if it plummets to under a dollar in value. Meteoric rise, followed by a bigger crash than anyone thought possible — prepare for the rise of alt coins?

Feels like with a rise this fast, the dip could exceed expectations. Looking forward to the next 2 weeks!
