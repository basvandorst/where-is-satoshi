Is the option to disable the 2-factor auth method intended as an optional feature or how the card would work in all cases?
I think a debit card with 2-factor authentication like that would be awesome!  OTOH I can see how it would be cumbersome for small transactions.

I tried using it at a Starbucks inside a Barnes and Noble. Learned the hard way that you can't use Starbucks gift cards inside B &amp; N so paid with cash. The bonus is that instead of being left with a gift card to lose or remember to use later, I just requested the refund via the fold app, and voila, I got my BTC back.
To me, that's actually pretty awesome - it failed to do what I want but "fixing" the problem was dead simple.

What about allowing people to pre-auth big purchases before walking up to the counter?
What if I were in a store and knew I wanted to buy a TV that would cost ~$433.  So I log in to your app and click "Pre authorize purchase of up to $500 for the next 15 minutes".  Then I walk up to the counter, pay for the TV, and walk out.  No need to possibly be embarrassed at the counter, yet I'm still in control.  Win.

It is a failure of the Bitcoin system that full nodes are not incentivized automatically with bitcoin rewards. If they were, there would be plenty of them. Not saying I know how I'd achieve that, just saying this is why I think there aren't more full nodes.

Agreed, I was sad when I heard that.  It's important to make everything as simple as possible, but not simpler, when explaining these kinds of things.  
They also missed an opportunity to explain that it's like a lottery and how the prospect of winning this lottery is what keeps the miners honest. 
Also, miners don't actually discover bitcoins, they get to create them and pay them to themselves when they win the lottery 
I know it's hard to explain this stuff but it's better not to put out a video which has oversimplifications that are wrong, yet *seems* accurate.  Too bad because I liked a lot of the video, but as it is I can't share it...

Good point, but I was thinking it'd be cool if you could know who else was trying to sign it, and then approve it or not depending on who they are. So, say a company could give every employee a key, and allow them to try to buy stuff, but the transaction would be approved by someone with the master key. If an employee is let go or leaves, you can choose to never sign a transaction from them.

He liked Bitcoin until someone reminded him where he comes from.
"William Henry Gates III made his best decision on October 28, 1955, the night he was born. He chose J.W. Maxwell as his great-grandfather. Maxwell founded Seattle's National City Bank in 1906. His son, James Willard Maxwell was also a banker and established a million-dollar trust fund for William (Bill) Henry Gates III."

If you're as smart as John Nash, maybe you're never too old...  Given the level of his genius, Bitcoin may have been a fun side project he decided to fiddle with in his old age. It also might help explain that while he knew all of these various concepts well enough to put them all together, he wasn't a "master" coder or cryptographer (as Gavin has pointed out). Often smart academics have a wide variety of skills but don't display the mastery that someone who is an expert in that field 100% of the time will display. The true genius of Bitcoin is in the game theoretical way in which mining works... so Nash seems like a good fit for that.

Thanks for letting me know the benefits of Google, I had no idea.  And yes, I have tried that with Bitcoin.  Finally, at least with Bitcoin if it scales to Google proportions, I'll be rewarded just for being a user.

Good points. Note also that mainstream scientists were so dubious of Einstein's theory of General Relativity that they [explicitly]( did not name that theory as one of the reasons why he [won the nobel prize in 1921]( He won the prize


Also, there was a caveat that the award was granted


This is despite the fact that experimental [proof of General Relativity had been found in 1919]( 
I think the current history we're experiencing with Bitcoin is eerily similar. Surely the Bitcoin network hasn't had to handle transactions on the scale of the rest of the modern banking system. On the other hand, it comprises billions of dollars of value and has functioned amazingly well. In some ways, how it works and the fact that it works is as mind boggling as General Relativity. As an aside, maybe this one reason why so many people with a Physics background are drawn to Bitcoin (ask around at the next meetup with 20 or more people - you're bound to meet someone with a physics degree).
If this trend continues, we can expect to see resistance to the ideas Bitcoin puts forward from financial "experts". On the other hand, it means Bitcoin - just like relativity - will triumph in the end because ... well because it works.

Well, if you're holding the fiat in your hand it's not at risk. But, to get it into this system, you need to transfer it to a third party (OKPay). When it's at that third party it's at risk as much as your cash is always at risk when its held by someone else.

I think the difference is supposed to be that with coinffeine, your Bitcoin private keys are always under your control (haven't used, but this is what I read). You are only taking a risk when you are holding fiat (this is very different from current exchanges).

"For an economy to work well, money needs to be created (for example, through bank credits or government spending) and withdrawn (through debt servicing and tax payments) following economic logic. We have all seen recently, in the global financial collapse of 2008-09, how irresponsible behavior on the part of big banks with regard to their lending and debt-servicing practices can set off widespread financial panic followed by years of economic stagnation."
Thanks for making the argument against the current system for us, jackass.

Note that I didn't say that the chargebacks themselves were 7% but that the lost profit *can* add up to that.  Obviously this will vary.  There are more reasons that profit is lost due to chargebacks (and the fear of chargebacks) including, but not limited to: rejected orders, cost of paying employees to deal with chargbacks and related issues, paying for services to detect fraud, limiting order sizes due to fear of chargebacks, and extra money lost due to affiliate payments on items that have been subjected to a chargeback, the fact that the chargeback fee of $25 might keep you from even offering certain low cost, high volume items due to fear of chargeback etc.
Bitpay is free for smaller businesses, so there is no 1% fee.
Credit card processors take 3% off the top
Also, I didn't "demand" that they give an additional discount. I said "please offer".
In the end - the point is it would be great if merchants could offer - at least for now - a discount equal to their normal cost associated with accepting credit cards and other forms of payment. If that's only 2% for you - so be it.

Not necessarily. If the profit margins are high you may still take credit cards - as many do. However, believe me you'd rather not have to deal with chargebacks so if you could make the same amount of money (or more) by offering a discount for BTC payments it's a good idea.

We, as a forward thinking community of developers, need to figure out how to get people off of the Android and iOS crack they're addicted to, and onto a truly free and open phone software and app store. This is unacceptable, that a developer can't accept donations for a free app they've written without being a non profit. I used to think mobile apps were great - now they just piss me off because devs can't actually do what they want. Heck, I'd rather have windows 95 back - maybe Microsoft sucks too, but at least I could run whatever someone wanted to build for me. CLOSED GARDEN APP STORES SUCK. This requires a truly major shift - perhaps even to a DApp cell phone service provider and OS - the likes of which we've never seen. If it's faster, better, and cheaper --- people will use it. That's what we have to figure out how to do and I think crypto technology like Bitcoin, Etherium, MaidSafe, etc. can get us there ... someday.

There is no fee for small merchants using Bitpay. Would I rather they accept Bitcoin "more natively" and hold it - sure - but of course many won't.
So, they can save 3% easily.  Passing that on to the consumer is only fair for the time being at least.
Maybe only merchants who "See the light" that they can help "change the world" by doing this will do it. But others might see that they can get "Free advertisting" (and even free press) from Bitcoin enthusiasts telling / posting about to other Bitcoin enthusiast that they offer a discount for Bitcoin.
In a world where discounts are often offered for no other reason than it's some president's birthday or something ... offering a small discount that doesn't actually cost you anything seems like an easy decision.

Wow that really pisses me off. I know they do junk like this and back when I was a student with a family to support they did it to me. I use PayPal to accept payments  online and they recently screwed someone over who had tried to pay with an e-check. The first payment attempt caused a $29 overdraft fee, and I tried to cancel the payment on the customers behalf. Anyway, they ended up trying AGAIN a few days later and causing a SECOND overdraft fee for the customer. They said next time this sort of thing happens I should tell the customer to request a stop payment from their bank to stop the second draft attempt, because they couldn't stop it. I said "doesn't that cost $25". They said... yeah. I'm no longer accepting e-checks - what a crock of crap.
