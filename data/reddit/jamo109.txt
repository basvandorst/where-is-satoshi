ive seen the video it is well done, thanks for the time and effort, im just still a bit cautious over the authenticity of bitaddress. 
not the same but strongcoin recently had a major floor in its website exposing thousands of wallets and password hints, as a result users were hacked. 
id just like to see bit address correctly audited before using their service. Even though the java script address creation is performed offline they may have some un-noticed code or floor in the way the addresses are generated which can be emulated to re-create those private keys

ive been debating about this same scenario. the responses were: 
- put a paper wallet in a safe at a bank and provide a lawyer with access to the safe
- put the private keys in your will

i guess, like a lot of things - taxes, insurance and lawsuits, if bitcoin goes mainstream there will need to be a lot of laws drawn up and passed on the basis of bitcoin, legal professionals will need to be re-trained and government will need to set some guidelines.. there are 'some' good things about centralised currency and this is probably to the peak of them.

value increases and more division kicks in
the entire global economy can be run from 1 BTC

Hahaha a bloke I knew got the sack for bitcoin mining on company infrastructure. The costs may not be a concerned but corporate security and policies certainly are
@_date: 2013-04-06 00:23:41
the weusebitcoins site and the bitcoin.org site should put up a big flash banner explaining what happens to lost coins
@_date: 2013-03-29 06:02:52
ok im sold, thanks for the tip! 
@_date: 2013-03-30 23:12:06
can bitaddress be trusted ? whats to stop them jigging the java script so that they also have a copy of all of the private keys ?

If.... ransom money is paid in fiat it usually tracked by serial number right?
Although the crooks never get far, they get arrested then the cash is recovered. 
If it was bitcoin it would be difficult to recover
@_date: 2013-04-04 07:44:41
More btc for us  then :)

@_date: 2013-04-01 06:52:17
Pretty good idea if it was run right
@_date: 2013-03-31 22:07:43
Mmmm this is turning bitcoin into a palpal scenario... will these escrows demand id and personal details once they get too busy to analyse each transaction? 
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:51:11
Mate if your in for the long term you will regret that statement . $135 is a good price
@_date: 2013-04-05 23:06:11

So sending a few bitcoin is still guaranteed without a fee? 
@_date: 2013-03-29 12:29:21
still this is going to be a problem for a customer wanting to buy small items online
@_date: 2013-04-05 09:16:19
you withdrawing fiat or crypto ?
ive got a bit of LTC in there... eeeekkk 
@_date: 2013-04-02 09:04:24
eben pagan could probably do a decent job of educating everyone? How much bitcoin are you willing to pay though ?
@_date: 2013-03-29 11:36:31
his phone number is listed on the site so its probably ringing off the hook right now
@_date: 2013-04-01 09:59:48
Nope still early days. You would be an early adopter . Imo when the price is out of reach for just 1 bitcoin eg $5k is when id say its too late 
@_date: 2013-03-31 06:51:08
Ok but it just happened to this guy? 
@_date: 2013-03-31 22:16:44
When restoring the wallet to another app how does it decrypty? Is it decrypted by your blockchain info password or can anyone with access to the backup restore the wallet and access your private keys?
@_date: 2013-03-29 11:46:20
+1 the transaction fee HAS to lower
i am a merchant who will be accepting bitcoin for payment,. 
My two concerns are:
1. Since customers will need to pay the transaction fee as most of my products will be at least $60 + postage. 
2. if they do not pay the transaction fee their payment will take hours or days to process, this may reflect back on the seller if they do not understand the system. 
additionally if i was a customer i would be very concerned about buying online without the peace of mind to request a chargeback or automated refund if the seller did not pull through or the item was lost in the post. 
@_date: 2013-03-29 12:14:31
holy shit.... did i just read this correctly ?
you want to know if we can use the block chain to transport digital products / digital keys ? awesome idea
i can see it now,  kids will be saying " im going to blockchain that movie and the latest metallica album" instead of "torrent" it. although it should not be abused for this activity but what if it is possible ?
@_date: 2013-03-30 09:56:38
Whats the difference printing a paper wallet between blockchain and armory? 
@_date: 2013-04-04 10:02:51
Moving back and forth between wallets and addresses is now starting to cost a bit in fees. Before it bits 200 the minimum fee has to be changed
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:49:35
Still a bargain imo
@_date: 2013-04-05 11:44:28
There will be key shortners coming out, infact you will be able to use your email address to mask a key very soon 
@_date: 2013-04-05 09:24:20
fuck yeah.. where do i sign up???
@_date: 2013-03-31 00:03:11
this is inevitable.... bitcoin wont grow unless it gets used (no matter what the value at the time) 
if everyone had this mentality bitcoin would have no value at all..

@_date: 2013-03-29 10:25:43
Sorry to hear. This sucks and is going to be a big problem for a lot of users who are too trusting and currently depend on their banks to have their back. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 21:56:34
This is probably being worked on id say along with a hardware wallet product.
Additonally it would be nice to give the fingerprint scanner of some laptops an ability to decrypt your wallet or keys
@_date: 2013-04-01 21:23:49
Yep ill keep buying up until $200 then ill take a break for a few months

What if mr 25% is dead or has lost his private keys? The 2million btc could be outright lost and never to be recovered
I highly doubt that there is someone sitting on this amount with access to it

nor am i :-) 
@_date: 2013-03-31 06:04:13
Can the same private key be used with multiple wallets at same time? Whats to stop this happening in future for the noobs out there?

Mmm if it was one org then you would think that they would save to a central file share or usb drive to instead of downloadinf from each client?  Very sus
