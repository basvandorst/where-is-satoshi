They will probably cancel your order and flag you as "high risk" and wont process the order as they are currently on the losing end of BTC

Dont do it. Use another service.

I have used Coinbase for the past year. I have several purchases from the same bank account. I am certified to level 2 and have had instant purchases prior to the need to verify a credit card. GO fuck yourself

I do believe that they canceled my order due to the significant loss for them.
@_date: 2013-11-08 02:43:23
I told you. They canceled all the orders under what I think is 270.

When the price drops they make money. You paid a higher price than at which they acquired them. 
you paid 125 for each. They paid 90. They made money from you.
Edit: Also they wouldn't cancel a transaction where the buyer loses money because it makes them money.

Coinbase kinda sucks. 
They play on arbitrage. You buy the coin at a price but they wait 5 days to deliver it. In those 5 days the price can go down, then they profit. Or the price can go up, but  as what happened this week, if the price goes up too much in the five days Coinbase stands to lose money. So they cancel all the orders in that time frame and flag them as "high risk". Its not illegal since the money was never taken from your account, but it is pretty sketchy and a terrible way to run a business. Also they have zero communication.

Thats the thing. Its not a few extra bucks. They would have lost a fair some of money on this. As the price surged 40%. They would have had to buy all the BTC at 40% higher price and would probably hurt their books quite a bit.

No I just mean everybody who orders recently got flagged due to the price jump.

I dont understand your response. I am not high risk considering I have bought coins from coinbase for about a year now. I have lvl 2 verification. I was able to insta purchase coins before they added a credit card. Fuck you I have enough to not bee a high risk client. They just didn't enjoy the spread.

If the price goes up too much from the price at which you placed your order it is not profitable for them to make the transaction. So they deem it as "high risk". The price went up 40% i bet anybody that placed and order under 270 was screwed.

They don't take the money until after the 5 days. At that point their algorithm decides if the price difference between your purchase date and the current date has a huge spread. When it does it is a "high risk" move for them.

He can say w/e he wants. The fact is it seems they canceled a lot of orders and people more verified than me. By doing which they make themselves a ton of money. They make the money but not having to give the bitcoin to us at the low price which we bough it.
