You severely lack imagination.

You're about 3 years late with these arguments.

I've been a Coinbase user for almost 3 years now. I just tried using the app to buy more BTC and they asked me to verify more info on their website before I could place an order... I said screw it and bought with Circle. 
Coinbase, why nag long-term users like this? You already have all my info.

The last thing I want is for Coinbase to have scans of my face. Banks don't require it.

There's Dogecoin for that.

Diluting the money supply would go against the interest of everyone involved with Bitcoin. It's a sure way to kill the project and have everyone jump ship. Won't happen.

Awww yeah stroke me harder

Actually, I earn my wages in the US, but still have open accounts in France. As far as the French banks are concerned, I am French. In addition, you're not even supposed to have to declare assets under FATCA if your accounts are under $50,000, which is why I told them to get lost.
I told them I'd rather close my accounts if they're going to bother me with this stuff. We'll see what they say next year.

Cool story. Litecoin still pointless.
*Someone enlighten me on what Litecoin has brought to the table in the past 3 years instead of downvoting like sheep.

The dude talks like he's a fucking guru and Wright is Jesus. Get outta here.

But will Bitcoin solve its block size crisis by years end? Stay tuned.

Incorrect. FATCA requires foreign institutions to communicate to the IRS your foreign assets if they know or suspect you are an American citizen. My understanding is that you're only required to pay taxes to the US if you are being taxed a lower amount in a foreign country (You'd have to pay the difference to the IRS if you owed more the US).
In the case of France, where taxation is much higher than the US, a US citizen working in France and paying taxes to the French government would not owe anything to the IRS, though they would still need to disclose their foreign assets which is invasive enough as it is.

The DPR "admin" account was likely used by multiple people at the same time. No one knows if Ulbricht was the one instigating these hits.
