Ok, so I went to bit address.org and I see both the public and private keys.  Does that mean I generated a key and I can tie a Bitcoin to it? 
I see on Coinbase that I have a Bitcoin address that I assume was generated when I bought a bitcoin. Can I tie it to one of these addresses I generated and store it offline?  I guess I am asking how I ensure that the Bitcoins I purchase on Coinbase don't get compromised.

You are correct. 
The reason the "create PDF" fails is due to a lack of "print to PDF" on the Linux distro. PDF creation assumes that your machine has a driver to do so. The Linux distro likely does not. So, I just ran this site offline and it creates fine on a Windows box. Maybe install the distro to a USB bootable and install a PDF driver.
1.) Some people in this subreddit do not understand how computers work, apparently.
2.) Some of those may or may not know how to read code. The code looks legit to me.

And how do they get this mythical cash, then?
You're talking about the collapse of the free world and theorizing that the power would never come back on. I think, in this day and age, you would pretty hard-pressed to find a lot of people who are carrying cash daily. 
I can't remember the last time I touched the stuff.
Maybe you should head over to and theorize there.

This is exactly the answer I needed.  It gave some clarity.  And then I can import those keys into the wallet software or just print them out and store them away.  I don't know how to tip Bitcoin but if I could I would.  Best I can do is some Gold until I gain more understanding!

It appeared, cascading down, and then slowly cascaded back up. What is that? Who is that?
Edit: Just noticed it is the same address listed as the "Whiskey Fund" at the bottom of bitcoinity. Nothing to see here! Sending bitcoinity some whiskey. Use their site 99% of the time to check prices.

Thanks for your reply.  Lots of good info.  Will read more about the blockchain.
Ok, so if a Bitcoin has an address and you need to buy something that requires 1.5 BTC then do you send both addresses?  Or does your wallet software manage all of that?
Also, in theory, paper wallets would appear to be the most secure assuming you don't lose them, they don't burn up in a fire or a Bitcoin knowledgeable thief doesn't break in to your house.  I assume you would care for it like data, with one filed away and one filed off-site.
