Andreas Antonopoulos said something interesting on the identity of Satoshi, “it doesn’t matter who he is. If you have two parallel lines that are infinitely long, will they intersect? No. Now tell me what do you know about Euclid and his life... Code of bitcoin can be verified to work the way it is described by anyone today.” something like that anyway. Satoshi just fast forwarded the process of time to forget him. Massive respect for the revolution he did still.

Same. Did a bunch of small investments but the lump sums i did were when it peaked at 11k. Just made an excel sheet showing the purchased £/btc, btc, £ spent on each trade so i just enter the £/btc now to know when would be best to sell any amount. Not much to do but wait because selling at a loss is a waste of time and money

@_date: 2018-04-04 20:29:27
Right, in October the day graph showed 2 big red candles, one slightly lower than 6200, thus the four times. Theres a baby red in October too for the maybe 5

If it goes lower than 6k it’s a bear flag. It could very well also be testing the February low once more before moon
@_date: 2018-04-04 01:07:04
It either keeps going up or it goes to 6200 then goes up - maybe
