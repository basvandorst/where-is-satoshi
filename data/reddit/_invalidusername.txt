I work in AI development, people have very unrealistic ideas of what AI is capable of.

Welcome and good luck! Three pieces of advice:
* [Don't put in any money you can't afford to lose!](
* Do research before using any third party wallets/exchanges!
* HODL strong!

In Korea you can create a temporary "virtual" account which is only open for a very short period of time (like a day). They're used to make payments (eg: buying something online, you pay into the newly created virtual account). These are getting banned

I just ran the scrapers on my [crypto sentiment site]( negativity towards BTC is is slightly higher than most other days
It usually hovers around 70% to 73% positive, it's down to 64% today.
This obviously doesn't prove much, it's expected for the sentiment to be more negative during a dip.

And in this context "funny" means something more like "strange". For example: "It's strange that you mentioned Aunt Hilda, I was thinking about her yesterday"

Biggest issue would be refunds since bitcoin is fairly volatile. You could buy something one day for the equivalent of say $100, not be happy with it and return it the next day for say $70 (or an increased price) because the value of bitcoin has changed. It makes it difficult for businesses. 
Don't get me wrong, there are ways around it (paying a bit extra for a fixed rate "insurance"), but I do think it is one of the main things holding bitcoin back from being widely accepted
