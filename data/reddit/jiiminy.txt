Is there any other 'manufactured' property that are taxed before being sold? This sounds like special treatment, malice?

All of them , it means sky high fees.

This recent IRS action reeks of malice, not unlike the unlawful targeting the IRS performed on the TEA Party.

Always interesting to here what the IRS has to say but this is a decision for the Courts to interpret the law, not the IRS. As much as the IRS likes to pretend, they are subject to same laws as everyone else.
And off hand it seems the IRS has got mining wrong, unless the law permits special treatment for targeted income groups. The idea that a mined Bitcoin is taxable on mining seem unlawful. That would be like saying if someone combines some bread, mustard and ham they have immediately created a taxable event, clearly ridiculous. No way a Court of the people's Law would allow a special interpretation like that. Or if you were to build a shed in your back yard, that would be a taxable event once built, and when you sell?

The IRS is not allowed to act punitively to protect their bankster buddies, they have to treat everyone the same or the People's Court of Law will strike them down.

2bitIDIOT is a shill hired by Selkiks to help him sell his Bitcoin insurance scam. MSM doesn't see a conflict of interest, just a convenient vector to sell advertising to "obsolete financial middlemen and fiat hucksters" to riff on and spread negative propaganda about BTC.

Once the IRS goes after someone, and they refuse to consent, it may end up in court and the court will decide if what the IRS is trying to do is lawful.
The IRS could also be sued if they act with malice or negligence.

I think that depends if you believe in States Rights.

Yes, and my understanding that cash on an exchange in a open interest position after coins are sold are not income there either. Only whence the transferred to bank account and fees paid are they in your possession and taxable.
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:01:21
Yes, could leave the IRS liable for civil damages.

Is a ham sandwich taxable when you make it?
Then why is a BTC taxable when you make it?
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:49:57
THIS IS NOT A RULING! THIS IS GUIDANCE!
Courts will eventually rule on wether what the IRS is doing is lawful and/or negligent or with malice.

We are talking about income taxes here.
Schools and police are paid for by land taxes.
Roads are paid for with gas taxes.
Vaccines are paid by ObombaCare taxes.
The American citizens generate a %12 resources  royalty on their r public lands, which the government takes and hides some where.
Essentially the only thing income tax is used for is wage foreign warsa and  pay the banksters interest on a debt which many consider constitutes a crime.
Please understand what you are talking about before you make ridiculous claims.
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:20:47
So if I combine HW, SW and electricity to make myself a birtcoin, and the law says that is a taxable event, then if I combine $3 worth of ham, mustar and bread, to create a sandwich Subway would sell for $6, would I have created a taxable event?
seems if the so called 'law' is imposed evenly mom's will revolt!
@_date: 2014-03-27 13:54:07
This is only guidance, not law, courts will likely decide.
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:14:59
If government ran on BTC, it would be easily to audit, more accountable and relatively fraud free. 
People need to realize that many of our laws are in place to protect our rights from people like this Senator.

Gas taxes pay for roads.
Telephone is run by many private companies.
Internet is run by many private companies.
You have no idea what you are talking about.
Income taxes goes to pay interest on the debt. Period.
@_date: 2014-03-26 22:54:00
This is only guidance and must be tested in court (ie. challenged) to become law. Sounds like the Silk Road lawyers   have an opportunity here.

When a government takes actions that results in damages, when they are sued in court, unless they can show they attempted due diligence, it makes them more culpable.
@_date: 2014-03-26 14:53:35
If BTC is property  like a bushel of corn, a cord of wood or an ingot of gold, then why is it taxed when created?
No other property type is taxed until sold, so they are lying when they say they will treat it as property.
Sounds like the IRS is acting punitively against BTC. Like they attacked the TEA party.
@_date: 2014-03-27 00:34:48
The unreasonable treatment of miners will likely drive them offshore, cause US BTC transaction times to slow to a crawl.
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:47:01
So if the tax rules are applied equally to all, then tonight when people combine their boiled macaroni with oil and cheese powder to make their Kraft Dinner ( or what ever you make for dinner) you are creating a taxable event. 
Just like mining BTC, when you combine PC, internet and electricity..
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:51:14
So if creating a BTC is income they why is making a coffee not income?
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:00:44
When the people wrote The US Constitution it basically banned fiat when it said all debts must be paid in gold and silver. The people wanted to be sure they would not be financially oppressed by anything like the King's law again. And until 1971 at least part of the US dollar was always backed in gold. Nixon ended that.The only reason they have gotten away with it so long, there was no practical alternative.
BTC changes that.
@_date: 2014-03-27 13:54:58
But, the government must obey the people's law, whether they like it or not.

The user base for USD is mostly parasite class, people who live off the system without actually producing anything. Accountants, lawyers, police and government workers. Of course they hate any thing they cant feed off.
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:01:10
BTC is free speech. Good luck banning that in the People's Courts, see how that has gone. US Government has the right to control the US Dollar because they created it and actually own it. You just cant counterfeit. The government can not interfere with my right to speak anymore than they can interfere with my right to arrange 0's and 1's as I(we) see fit. 
Section. 10. (US Constitution)
"No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility."
Seems the US Government breaks the currency law all the time, creating torturous injury to its citizens..
@_date: 2014-03-26 23:03:57
What law, and what other products are taxable before being sold?
@_date: 2014-03-26 16:37:03
No we fully expect to be attacked by those who support the fraud BTC exposes.
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:39:31
Then remember this, by that logic, when you make you dinner tonight , that is a taxable event.
And remember, the IRS is not allowed to act punitively or favor any groups.
I would suggest Kraft Dinner.
@_date: 2014-02-27 00:45:33

@_date: 2014-03-27 16:24:08
Untill the IRS goes after someone and creates actual damages, this cant be taken to court and challenged. My guess is the IRS will change its opinion before it gets to that. Right now what they are doing is just targeted intimidation.
@_date: 2014-03-26 16:39:00
Or BTC community can take the IRS to Court and sue them like the TEA Party is doing.
@_date: 2014-03-27 14:16:11
The cases you cite involve some one else giving you something. In the case of BTC mining, it it is something one creates themselves. If what you said was true, if a person were to combine bread, mustard and ham, they would have a taxable event to resolve every time before they could eat lunch.
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:04:50
Currencies in the hands of corrupt politicians is the most dangerous thing on the planet, responsible for death and misery of millions.
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:20:57
Is the IRS specifically targeting Bitcoin miners like they attacked the TEA Party or are they going to apply these so called laws evenly.
Because if combining HW, SW and electricity is a taxable event, then combining $3 of ham, cheese and bread for what Subway would sell for $6 should be taxable as well.
@_date: 2014-03-26 22:08:44
If manufactures are not taxed until their products or property is sold, then why is BTC  treated differently?
@_date: 2014-03-28 17:05:16
Actually the 1st Amendment-Sec. 10 forbids the the US Federal Reserve Note (commonly know as The Dollar), but that dosn't cause Congress to stop the private corporation the Federal Reserve from doing this.
Proves that is the USA, when it comes to the law, its not what  you know but who you know.
Section 10.
No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:04:46
From my understanding at Law, US Government can only 'influence' how BTC is exchanged for USD, which in the long run would be fruitless in stopping it. I feel it is their responsibility to embrace BTC 'as is' and build supporting infrastructure for sales and income tax collecting that should reduce cost and red tape for tax payers. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 13:59:06
Not really, it is the IRS responsibility to Citizens to do their due diligence. Only the courts can force the government to do something.

This is just Obomba being racist. He hates white people and he knows mostly white people own BTC.
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:28:46
After all the BTC falsehoods and negative propaganda published in that Govt. spook rag Wired, nobody in the crypto community should be talking to Wired.
Since I think it was Hearst Publishing(ie yellow journalism) bought Popular Science and I think Scientific American and Wired too, all of these magazines have stopped publishing science and started publishing government propaganda and programming.
