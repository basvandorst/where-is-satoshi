The cards aren't out yet, there's no ship date yet, only that Monaco has Visa on the line to allow cards with apps and crypto. Since I'm in United States, I'm not actually expecting any of this to be useful to me.

As long as the unicorns don't slip on all the blood leaking from the severed invisible hand of capitalism, I'm totally cool with any BRAND of digitized robotic prosthetic to rule the "economics" world so "men" with neckties can go home. I just want to buy milk at a store sometimes, without pretending I'm in a 90's hacker movie shifting "funds" through my "institutions" for two hours outside a truckstop with a BTC ATM.

Right, a movie about debit cards, secret wealth, and a global game of keep-away. Make sure to WIRE for the ticket purchase, or you'll only see the bottom half of the screen.

So you compared a human relationship to your wallet, like holding off on acquiring happiness until there is no more happiness to be purchased? Yeah, my buy wall would flatten too, better buy the dip.

Great, a new way to send and hide data, that means kiddie porn is on the rise and we have to sacrifice all that hard work to ensure the blah blah blah...

so if i find a customer's card, i don't have to track them down, i can just give myself five tips and it'll show up on their history when they call to report it lost.
also, put this in a pair of panties so i can hold my credit card in my teeth at the strip club...
