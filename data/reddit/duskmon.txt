I'm sure you're seeing all kinds of posts about charities, so I'll add mine here as well. 
I recently left my New York City job as a software engineer at Yahoo to CoFound a small startup with one of my best friends in my local community. We started out giving food to the homeless every day, but we have a dream of creating the very first shower bus on the east coast. 
Our goal is that we can use this bus to provide free hygiene, first aid, haircuts, and health services to our local community. If the homeless don't appear different than anyone else, than they won't be. 
We only need about 300,000 to retrofit the bus, we just ran our first successful fundraiser earlier this year after becoming a 501(c)(3). 
I've been following the Bitcoin community forever but have always been too cowardly to invest myself. 
We've submitted an application to the Pineapple  Fund. If you were willing to support our mission I would be incredibly grateful, and the underserved homeless community of New Jersey would appreciate your sacrifice. 
You can find more info about the mission here:  
Whether you choose to support us or not, thank you for doing this. You're making the world better.

So it's just more copies of the blockchain? Why is it good that we have them?

What are you doing to make the average Greek citizen feel like they should be using Bitcoin in order to further dependence on it in Greece and further your own products?
