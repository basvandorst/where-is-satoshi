Oh yes, that seems bit tricky. I only use manual input and wallet watch, so I did not think about that.
I found one bug, if you attempt to fill total invested usd before filling total invested btc, then app will crash.

Well, I always choose to not send error report. But now replicated the problem and send report.

This is something I was looking for recently. I have started using  , I believie it is one of most popular app of this kind. But I have quickly switched to yours, because it seems better. One thing I would suggest would be ability to create multiple profiles (multiple portfolios), seems it is not possible yet.

Personally I would use ¤.
It used to be culture neutral currency symbol, but now it is mostly unused, so can be hijacked. I don't think many will support the idea, but I think it is nice way to express the worldwide currency.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:20:30
yes, definitely. internet has not disappeared after dot-com crash. and it became what is now. bitcoin enthusiasts are here to stay, get-rich-quick guys need to go home.

Exactly, I think Bitcoin had huge potential for micropayments, but it somehow got ruined by speculatation.
Seems people are not interested in Bitcoin filling unexplored niches and more in Bitcoin replacing established systems (banks, national currencies). To be honest second of those things is ridiculous and will never be successful.
But every time I express my opinions on for what Bitcoins can be useful and for what they won't be, people just say I "don't get it". Too many "New paradigm" people here.
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:42:21
Well, i think i do understand what it is. I may be wrong, but can you prove I am wrong?
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:34:44
looks like they are having serious trouble. media may get interested in this story and bitcoin will crash even more.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:13:36
That's exactly what I was saying few weeks ago, and people said I am stupid. There is a Silk Road, everything else is pure speculation. And speculation leads to bubble.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:16:00
because industrial investors in case of bitcoin is guy who sold pizza for it.
@_date: 2013-05-05 22:42:47
spam transactions are not a problem. lack of scalability of Bitcoin is. not much has been improved for years. database system for blockchain was changed, this is good, but far deeper changes are needed. read more:  , this is just top of iceberg, there is more, but seems somebody editing this wiki to make things looks more optimistic.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:54:32
that's why it is called denial.
@_date: 2013-04-02 21:25:42
ok, i must admit, when i first heard about bitcoin 2 years ago, international payments was first thing come to mind as use for it. but so many time has passed and it is still quite difficult to buy and sell bitcoins in some countries.
I buy and sell bitcoins very easily with local exchange and online banking. but seems it is complicated to buy and sell bitcoins in united states and probably in many other countries.
when this will be solved it will indeed be worthwhile alternative for international payments.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:37:34
they didn't. It was just speculation and somehow it got catched by media.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:01:47
no, it is silly to hold on your coins while they are losing value. if you believe in bitcoin, why not sell now and buy them cheaper later?
@_date: 2013-03-01 12:58:18


Yes, I agree, I'm just saying in such areas there is biggest chance for wide adoption.


Yes, but i don't believe normal people will start using Bitcoin for just ideological reasons. It must be better in some way. And I see how it is better for grey-area business and for "one cent" micropayments. For anything else I don't see many advantages (expect ideological things, like you said: being decetralized, democratic, fair, etc). One advantage would be no need for middleman, but this not what is happening, so this is what made me think Bitcoin is heading in wrong direction.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:59:20
yes, most likely we will see some "return to normal". no bubble crash in one hit.
@_date: 2013-04-02 21:07:31
well, nothing.
bitcoin has something over established payment processors. i am just questioning if this something is enough.
here in my country i can send money to anyone with online banking. It is popular, easy, secure and cheap (with some banks there is no fee with other there is small fee, equivalent for $0.15). and i believe it is pretty much same in any contry in europe. paypal is only useful for me for internationial payments.
in united states online banking sucks, this is why paypal was born. but in europe most people don't even need paypal, let alone bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-02 20:27:36
No chargebacks can be good for some and bad for others. For people who can handle their own security and for merchants it's good for sure. But thank for your commend I understood that bitcoin fees can be cheaper because there is not company that needs to make profit. Would be great if bitcoin fee can say as low as they are now (actually minimal fee is still 0).
So bitcoin is cheaper to use and give user more control and freedom. any geek can see advantage. but i am still not sure about regular people. how payment processors works, they just hide fee from customer, so only merchants are aware. and about freedom and control most people just don't care. windows is still much more popular than linux, while it is cheaper more free and give user more control. do you think bitcoin can be more successful in payment processor market than linux is in operating system market?
about drugs again, i am not saying drugs market is niche, but buying it on Tor is.
@_date: 2013-04-02 20:29:55
yes, that is advantage. but practice shows that open source not always win with corporate. in some cases it works, in others it dosn't.
@_date: 2013-03-01 11:30:50
I think bad think about bitcoin is that it is kind of misused. Mega, Wordpress and Reddit all use middle-man (coinbase, bitpay, etc) to accept them. Whole purpose of bitcoin is no middle-man! Archive.org and wikileaks do it right, they just post their address. Of course accepting payment is bit more complicated than donations, but not that much. All nice properties of Bitcoin are lost because middle-man. In the end, bitcoin with middleman is not any better than paypal.
Same with wallet, too many people use web-wallets etc. Again all good properties of bitcoin are lost. I know that full bitcoin client is bit annoying to use, but it is like this for the purpose, to not be dependant on anything except bitcoin network.
There are some people how use bitcoin as it should be used, for example cybercriminals. they accept payments in bitcoin then pay in bitcoin, all with bitcoin client itself. probably same with Silk Road. Illegal, gray-area and controvelsial things is where bitcoins shines, and this is good, but seems most people don't appreciate it. But big bussines, come on, they do it WRONG. Mega use chain of two middleman to accept your bitcoins, this is ridiculous!
I think there are some misunderstanding on how bitcoin adoption would look like. I think bitcoin has biggest chance for adoption in areas where other money (like paypal) can't be used. But many people rather think that great adoption would be about people paying with them in grocery store. Really this makes no sense to use bitcoins in AFK world, i don't know why community is so interested in in. Better way (cash) already exists for AFK use, and I see no place for bitcoin there. Same about online payments with legit business, there is no advantage in using bitcoins, unless it is about microtransactions (i mean things like 0.01usd or similiar), yet no many people are interested in finding use for such microtransactions, they rather want established bussiness to accept bitcoins, where other payment already works well, so bitcoin there serves little purpose.
TL;DR people don't use bitcoin how it meant to be used, and look for applications of it not where they should look for.

we are at "denial" now
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:02:57
after they will resume trading site will most likely go down shortly because of cumulated load and panic. if you have any bitcoins on mtgox your best bet is to move them out mtgox to another exchange and sell them as soon as you can and try to rebuy them at "the bottom".
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:31:14
China is next Cyprus. Nothing more than speculation tool. Of course there is some potential, but that's it for now.
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:38:46
It may be different in inner working, but both serve same purpose. I agree that there are numerous advantages, but I am not sure if those advantages are significant enough.
@_date: 2013-04-16 08:43:30
$0 :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:28:42
if you believe in bitcoin sell now and try to re-but at the bottom, watching your bitcoins lose value for next days is not good idea.
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:36:25


Yes, but Palpal can always make fee smaller and make their policy more friendly. If they need to be more competive, they will do it. On other hand bitcoin fees may become huge if transaction count increase and scalability issues are not solved.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:38:51
Soon it will be over. Bubble has attracted some really stupid people. Now bubble pops, idiots get separated from their money, so they will cry and leave.
