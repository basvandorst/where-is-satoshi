I'm still kind of new to all this bitcoin stuff, and I've been thinking about something: are there any "dumb" bitcoin web clients?
By "dumb" I mean no user/transaction information is stored on any servers and the website would effectively work as a thin bitcoin client. You would have to insert a private key, select the destination address + amount and a change address, then the website would build a transaction and broadcast it, similar to electrum/multibit I'd guess? No registration needed whatsoever and by being open-source we'd have some kind of peace of mind.
Mainly for quicky dirty transactions that can be done from any device, without any installation required.

I separate my bitcoins in 2+ electrum wallets, I keep most of my bitcoins in wallet A (which I rarely make transactions from) and the rest in wallet B. 
I generated wallet A in a offline linux-distro, wrote down the MPK and safely stored the seed phrase (you could print it and store it in a physical safe) and deleted the wallet from the HD. That way I can keep an eye on my funds via a watch-only wallet from any electrum client by importing the MPK.
My wallet B file is kept in the HD with a strong password and its seed is also stored in another vault. I try to keep as little bitcoin (the amount you spend in your day-to-day) as possible in that wallet and always transfer most of it to wallet A.
If for some reason my computer gets compromised, only my bitcoins in wallet B will be stolen. If you happen to need to make a transfer from wallet A, you can recover your seed and make an offline transaction signing from the offline distro ( that can be sent afterwards from another online computer.
I recommend you do this for multiple "A" wallets.

Regarding 1), wouldn't having the hash of the previous block in the next block be sufficient?
