How many times have capital flight controls been implemented in world history?
What's easier to move through customs: $10,000,000 worth of bitcoin or $10,000,000 worth of gold bullion?
How many times has hyper inflation happened?
How much do you trust your government? Now tell me how much you'd trust them if you were Indian, Chinese, Russian, Greek, or Brazilian? How many Indians and Chinese are there? How many central and South Americans are there?

That's a liability and a weakness not a strength.
In a world full of predators and parasites having wealth whose form approaches the formless is an incalculable advantage.

Short term I actually agree with you. I think a violent correction is likely. Long term I think it will meet some of the more crazy sounding predictions.

Had bitcoin existed in the 1940s do you think it would have been OK for Jews to use it to move wealth out of Germany? Or would that be tax evasion?

And I'm trying (and failing) to point out why it has enormous value. Money and finance depend on reliable governments. Bitcoin can function in the absence of reliable governments (even better than gold). Many billions of people have had the bad luck of being born in the territory of unreliable governments. Therefore billions of unlucky people have a need for bitcoin. You and I are lucky first worlders. We don't really need bitcoin (I hope we never do). Not everyone can say that.
