Do you know how a future works? Just because institutions are offering contracts does not mean they have any way to affect bitcoins price, it just means they have yet another to try. Your link proves nothing

It has tons of value if you have insider knowledge of the market lol
Also I hear it's extremely efficient for shorting the market using pump and dump schemes

Investing in literally anything is not a good idea if you turn out to be wrong... That's kind of the nature of an investment lol

They prefer to use Monero and other alts not because of transaction times, but also higher anonymity behind transactions. It's definitely worth paying attention to but I see it just as the market diversifying itself, dealers are a niche demographic with different needs out of a currency than most so they gravitate towards niche coins. This is healthy for the market and also helps the public realize bitcoin has legitimate utility beyond being used for drug money

This is what pisses me off about bch too. It has advantages but ver destroys all credibility with his bitcoin.com shenanigans, trying to market it as "true bitcoin" and getting pissed off when people call it bcash , and blatant market manipulation like what happened yesterday.
I'd seriously invest in it long term for it's utility if I wasn't afraid he's gonna cause it to implode with a misstep one day

The 50% drop that was actually only a 35% drop? in under 2 days its recovered back to only 20% down from the ATH
Is it really optimistic to assume bitcoin will grow If that's what it's done 13 out of the past 18 months? I'd argue that with those statistics it's pessimistic even to assume it will stagnate the next half year.
What not enough people realize is that a "correction" can happen in both ways, the bottom of the free fall is not the correct price any more than the peak right before it drops, people are buying up all the coins they can at 13,14,15k because they realize that a couple days from now that will be a deal
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:33:05
No one has any way of knowing that, and looking at the path it's taken consistently the past five years it's a bigger stretch to say it will be worth nothing a year from now than to say it will increase or at least remain consistent
There will be crashes, there have been many before but bitcoin has always recovered. The next one isn't going to be the one to end it all just because you and your friends are paying more attention now, even if the price drops below 1000 or even 100 there will be people buying up as many as they can, simply because they don't trust their government to not massively inflate the fiat they've been supplied with

If he invested back in after losing thousands in 2014 he'd still be rich right now. You don't go "yeah I made a couple million off my investments but I could have made 50-100" and kill yourself, there's more going on here

He's probably projecting lol, that's what a lot of the recent hardline BCH supporters did: came into crypto the past two months and got convinced by someone that btc is bloated and on the way to failure and bch is the original vision.  A lot of them probably don't even realize that anyone who's held btc since Halloween has both, which is the main reason for it's success right now
Too many people in this thread are confusing being pissed off about shady business tactics and setting a bad name for the crypto market as "not being neutral enough" or bs like that. I have no bad feelings toward bitcoin gold or any of the other big coins but I will never support ver or anyone else who was involved in the clear market manipulation and disinformation campaigns that have gone on in the past weeks
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:16:45
Spreading the word that this happened is not the same as crying to the government, by not supporting exchanges and coins that manipulate the market like this and supporting those that are honest and transparent we can regulate the market ourselves

Or they've decided to invest long term and aren't worried about short term fluctuations.  The reason people say it so much is to tell other people that if they plan to hold long term, price crashes shouldn't worry them that much because bitcoin has recovered from every crash without fail.
Going in with the intention to invest long term and then selling low during a crash is just as much an example of "investing emotionally" as buying with the intent to flip short term and refusing to sell as it crashes

Thanks for having a rational opinion.  Having some fear of volatility this high is natural, but honestly I think a lot of the people saying this current rise is a bubble are those who regret selling in the past couple days and want a dip to justify going back in
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:32:51
No, they say that on average month for month price basically always goes up, nobody will tell you that you're always gonna be able to cash out at Ath whenever you feel like it.
Anybody been here longer than a couple weeks knows there are bad days, and most would advise you to plan to pull out for like a week or two before you do and not whenever you feel impulsive
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:19:44
I would pull the plug now. It's possible it will fall back down a couple hundred at some point in the next few days but it's equally likely it just keeps going up and you'll regret not going in now.
Also even if it does go lower it's basically guaranteed  it will rebound even higher before the fork

Who regulates the value of gold and diamonds? What keeps the next technological innovation from making them, or our idea of currency in general obsolete?
As far as your concerns of innovation, it's already begun. There are several cryptocurrencies that people argue are "better" than bitcoin in certain ways which have massively increased in value in the past couple months/years. In fact one of the reasons bitcoin has increased in price is because a lot of the markets for these coins are traded using bitcoins, so bitcoin is increasing in price not only because of its inherent value, but also because it gives access to the larger crypto market in general.  If bitcoins technology becomes obsolete then another coin will become the markets new favorite and take its place.

This same argument holds up for investing in any company not listed on the Fortune 500, and the majority of commodities and foreign currencies.  
Any kind of short term investment can be viewed as gambling. However, at least when you're investing in an open market like stocks or crypto you know the house hasn't already stacked the odds in every game  against you like normal gambling.

Anybody who was alive at that time could have invested. It's not impressive and nobody is going to care unless you did it well and are now worth a billion dollars like Draper.
@_date: 2018-03-07 14:19:07
Most of the people saying this 5 years ago are multi-millionaires now as long as they didn't pull out.
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:11:52
Yeah, because the majority of the people in this sub only have a couple hundred to a couple thousand invested, they aren't the big players backing bitcoin.
The majority of people that have hundreds of thousands or millions invested in anything usually have serious financial connections and better things to do with their time and money then speculating about random shit on reddit.
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:30:37
What is that even supposed to mean? If the money is in the technology and BTC arrived first, has the largest adoption rate and market cap, and the strongest team of developers then the technology is with bitcoin and the money will follow.
This is like predicting that the model t would be a failure because it's competitors weren't impressed by its performance, but the techniques ford used to manufacture it. Are you against all crypto or are you just a BCH fanboy starting to sweat lmao?
