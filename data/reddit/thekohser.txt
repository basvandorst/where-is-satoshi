The ads are the articles, though.  You didn't know that?

They love wasting your donations, too!

Your money will be very transparently managed by "Jimmy Group Ltd".  Seriously, that's the name of it.

We can be sure that this reporter will not be recruited:

What's Rachel Marsden have to do with this?

I'm sure some very high-quality paid journalists can be hired who won't mind at all their work being turned over to "community control", to modify, subvert, and ruin everything that they worked on.  Kind of like how Wikipedia used to have a well-written biography about multi-count felon Carolyn Doran, but then "community control" decided that Wikipedia shouldn't have a well-written, amply-sourced article about Carolyn Doran.  Any comment on why that worked out in that particular way?

"Sometimes things go wrong"?  Like Wikia Search, Openserving, CiviliNation, Impossible.com, and The People's Operator.  Yes.
@_date: 2017-04-26 20:41:37
Yeah, just like when you said Wikia was "completely separate" from the Wikimedia Foundation, then Wikia rented office space to the Foundation, and 3 out of 5 of the WMF board of trustees were Wikia principals.  You're so trustworthy, Jimbo.

Impact like a huge, deep crater.  Yes.

Sounds like jpflathead learned from the best how to treat other people in conversation.  See: "utter fucking bullshit" --

Well, let's be clear... the president of CiviliNation, Andrea Weckerle, was Jimmy's girlfriend.
So, at least part of the CiviliNation scheme was to bankroll a girlfriend in a tax-deductible way.  How charitable.

It's just a money grab.  See Jimbo's project CiviliNation with Andrea Weckerle (speculation has swirled about what her personal affiliation with Jimbo was).  Lots of fanfare about how it would fix the "broken" Internet comment environment.  Lots of donations collected.  Then guess what?  Look at the Form 990s.  Nearly eighty percent of all the money ever contributed went directly into Weckerle's pocket as salary.  Expect the same with Wikitribune.
@_date: 2017-04-27 12:32:38
Oh, primary funder, really?  Let's see... 2010 Form 990: $25,420 in contributions; 2011: $12,240; 2012: $15,500; 2013: $24,568; 2014: $4,700.  All summarized here: 
That's a total of $82,428.
If you were the "primary funder", let's say that's at least 50%, or $41,215.  You're actually saying... you attest that you donated over $41K to CiviliNation, during a period that Weckerle took $63,228 in salary, on total contributions of $82,428?
If so, you are saying that you basically bankrolled most of Andrea Weckerle's personal income from CiviliNation, which accomplished what?  CiviliNation.org isn't even a functioning website any more -- one presumes it has ceased operations.  And this proves what?  That you were so charitably inept that you forked over -- at a minimum -- $41,215 to a failed attempt to "fix" online civility that ultimately accomplished not much more than keeping your girlfriend Andrea in food, clothes, and shelter for a few years.  With tax-deductible dollars, no less!  And now you're asking the Bitcoin community to fund your for-profit plan to "fix" journalism?
It's just sad.  And pathetic.

Well, the more thought-provoking interpretation is that corporations that donate a big chunk of money to the Wikimedia Foundation find that they not only receive a "look the other way" from the WMF when they edit their own Wikipedia page, they might even get assistance sprucing up their articles from WMF staff and founder.  But, your sardonic retort was really moving, nonetheless.

Typical Wikipediot who doesn't even realize he should be thanking Larry Sanger, not this guy.
@_date: 2017-04-26 20:30:23
There is absolutely no evidence that humans today have a higher IQ than they did in 2001, before Larry Sanger (not Jimmy Wales) spawned Wikipedia.  So, thanks for being an example of exactly what is wrong with Wikipedia -- the assumption of fact of stupid things that sound legitimate.
Nice grammar error, too.  That made it a little extra-quaint for me.

Could you walk us through that $5,000 tip you awarded to Rauan Kenzhekhanuly?

Larry Sanger isn't here in this thread.  Who are you talking to?
