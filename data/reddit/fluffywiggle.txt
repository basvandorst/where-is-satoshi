I have an old seed that my brother has but couldn't access his wallet.. I tried importing to copay but there was nothing in the wallet. Is it because the password has to be correct?

Ah this might be it! I have to track the exact address I sent him the Bitcoin to see if there is actual money still left on there. Problem is that transaction is in an old phone I left at home before the holidays .  Hopefully it can be retrieved.. thanks for all your help!

I make bitcoin fox stickers on Kawaii Crypto :P Foxes are my favorite animal and I got into Bitcoin 2014, so it will always be my first love.

Foxes are my favorite animal and I got into Bitcoin early 2014, so it will always be my first Crypto love. I recently became a crypto entrepreneur and am making cute crypto themed stickers (I'm dressed as my Kawaii Crypto Bitcoin Fox).. If any of you are interested you can visit  I accept BTC and other alts as payment :)
