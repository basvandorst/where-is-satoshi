Stupid company just takes peoples money while making the people with inside information richer, whilst collecting the fee for trades. Oh yea what a coin !!!

You technically can, you just need over 51% of total computing power, if you check the history of bitcoin one mining company tired to do that in the past after they swore that they won’t. When they did groups started ddosing them and slowed em down so the hash rate went down and they couldn’t keep up with the other 49% but it’s possible. But the scaling bit coin mining has endured will make that even harder because there a lot of different mining companies and crews. You need a lot of moola and hardware to do so. 
Hope this helps!

The more people mining makes it so much harder to ‘exploit’ and makes it virtually impossible.

All depends on what coins you in
