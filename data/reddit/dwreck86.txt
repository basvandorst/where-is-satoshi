Yes. You can send to another wallet or cash out there

just curious, do you think this is what happened to you?

" Threat actors were able to trick users into downloading a malicious version of the wallet by exploiting a weakness in the Electrum software. "
apparently in the last version, hackers made a popup that had you download a hacked version?

are you in the US? so i guess you have to report every transaction on your taxes? id be interested in learning more about how people are using it as an actual payment method/giftcards etc. i wanna give my friend a paper wallet with some BTC on it but i almost feel like reporting it on my taxes appropriately wouldnt really be worth it, unless i was cashing out a huge amount or something, and even then it seems like an IRS nightmare.

i REALLY think you need to specify this going forward so new users to this site dont think its all a bunch of elitist butt wipes and register for BOTH services only to be shat on and accused of bullshit for no real reason, if people are really trying to exploit you for 3 cents, this whole entire situation is sad and why even bother
@_date: 2015-03-10 19:29:38
yeah. maybe i should start a thread and give bits to all the people who have new accounts, posted here, and were ignored 
@_date: 2015-03-10 18:51:10
so why do some people get some but not others?
@_date: 2015-03-10 18:27:15
hook me up please!!
@_date: 2015-03-10 18:40:37
does this work?
@_date: 2015-03-10 19:01:10
LOL so maybe you should specify its NOT for new members, sorry i joined reddit after reading the bitcoin stories here and seeing this thread and thought id try the changetip service, what a fucking jerk, take your three cents and shove it up your ass. youre the sad one here...
