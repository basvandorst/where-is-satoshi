I understand that miners mine with ASICs, but the point I'm trying to make is that they're currently not mining bitcoin. And that one random guy on the internet said when the ASICs are away, gfx can actually produce like $2-3 profit (after electricity costs) a day.
So I'm asking if anyone with experience can provide insight on whether that is possible.

Ah, in true crypto fashion, it's a wheel-less wagon. Because it's a roller coaster cart!

I think that's the beauty of it.

Really Daniel, why TaxMasterTax and not TaxMasterDan? 
Also, can the IRS actually do this? I mean *practically*, can they?

This is a surprisingly small fee if everything else if ~~feeless~~ free.

Buddy, the only reason taxes are still legal is because only plebes pay them. If you believe the government can force rich people to actually *pay* taxes you are in for a ride

I'm not an accountant but I'd guess this doesn't always apply to a)big companies in the US and b) individuals and companies outside the US. 
This is just a hunch -and I was definitely not joking-, but if the *Market Makers*(c) are losing money in their own market, it's only because they want to. Also I just had a ridiculously funny tinfoil epiphany, that the real reason the "Chinese New Year" meme exists is because Jihan is crashing the price to offset his taxes every time the Chinese new year actually comes around. Imagine if the meme was almost true in the end

Hey don't knock on Paypal! First they helped raise bitcoin awareness by refusing service access to wikileaks and now they do shit like this. To me it seems like they're secretly the good guys and not getting enough credit for it
