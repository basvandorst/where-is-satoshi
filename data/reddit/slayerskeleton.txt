This meme didn't age well.

any person you are refering as "level-headed people in crypto" would refer bitcoin directly as gambling. You can find similarities between gambling and volatile market yet bitcoin is nothing like "putting your entire position on BLACK on roulette".
You are being arrogant and emotional.

Can I store other coins in it as well?

Meaningless post, don't get emotional with your investment and let's not turn this sub into a hype train. This sub should be for exchaning information and knowledge.

You pay the same amount when you transfer 100$ or 200$. You may consider making a bigger transfer instead of betting and depositing again to the betting website.

Have the same question, I fear that it will go 20-25k and dip to higher levels than today's. But panicing never worked so I assume I just need to stay calm.

experimental probability works as well. I'm right now not capable of accurately predicting when whales will pull their money, even when I read stuff online about the current state of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:48:47
They are just repeating the same arguments.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:41:30
Aren't day traders are doing the same thing except they sell a portion at ATH's instead of holding? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:35:17
Mathematically you are wrong. If you buy at  you make %16 more profit when it hits 100k.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:49:57
This is not gambling and waiting for a dip is not being greedy. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:57:48
I think we can agree on these:
-never falling below the ATH that you are looking at is not likely.  is the price I'm looking at right now, will it ever fall %5 from here? Highly probable.
-19k is ATH, it goes to 25k and the dip is 20k. You did not lose a lot in btc even refering to this unlikely example. It's more likely that the price will go below 19k. 
It's my opinion that it's a better strategy but just like any other good strategy it may not work out and leave you with less.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:48:28
Please explain mathematically how I was wrong.
edit: here is the logic behind my statement. 17.5 btc  or 15 btc  you pay the same amount. 17.5/15 =1.166 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:45:00
If you don't care about %16 increase in your holding, keep it to yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:05:10
Why it's not gambling? Because gambling is based on randomness, and investing in bitcoin is not, it's backed by blockchain technology and can revolutionize "money".
"a dip could land your position in hot water", here is the thing, bitcoin is volatile. Past days may be super good in terms of market cap, but believe it or not it will go lower levels than today - and buying at those times will make you have more bitcoin.
Experienced people ask you to not invest recklessly, it's not because this is a gamble and you gamble what you afford to lose. In past the bitcoin went through hard crashes, you don't want to have a big portion of your money on something so volatile and involves high risk - but it's more likely that bitcoin will keep going mainstream and more wealthy individuals and institutions will be intrested in it. These factors makes bitcoin a good investment for the amount you can afford to lose.

you may have not read "(assuming the investment in USD is constant)" part. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:46:46
that's not how math works, but if you say so ^^
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:45:52
Yes it works as well since bitcoin constantly is constantly hitting new ATHs, good for you :)

Plot twist: op is actually Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:09:43
same behaviour as today, just a predicition.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:43:49
with this logic any investment is a gamble since you can lose a % of your investment. Risk in the investment doesn't make it a gamble. Every decision in your life will involve risks.

It would drop the prices since they have to sell them, then the big mac price should go down, which never happens. Shows that they don't really over-produce.
