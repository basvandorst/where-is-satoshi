I dunno, I see a lot of people rejoicing at the low bitcoin prices, and saying "tough luck" or "sucks to be you" to those that lost a lot.

People weren't treating bitcoins like a commodity, they were treating it like a currency. I don't argue against bitcoin as a commodity like gold, I only argue against those who use bitcoin as a vehicle to argue for the dismantling of regulatory bodies.
And to answer your question, the FDIC doesn't insure stock exchanges, but people were treating these bitcoin exchanges like banks.

People stick with FDIC insured banks because working folk need something more reliable than an organization that's going to go belly up and disappear. 
TLDR: tell those people who lost their entire savings in mt Gox "cheers"

So let me get this straight. Since the FDIC hasn't had to endure another Great Depression, it hasn't proven itself as an institution, yet if another Great Depression happens (you guys say it's inevitable, year after year) the FDIC and other regulatory bodies will be to blame. Seems like you've set yourself up a nice self fulfilling prophesy.

The FDIC is a ring in the defenses of economic stability. In 08 if the FDIC wasn't around to do what it does, there would have been a bank run. There would have been billions if not trillions more lost. There would have been a Great Depression. Removing the FDIC would not bring what you want, it would only remove one of the few safeguards left against the economic instability we experienced regularly in the 1800s through the Great Depression.

That's pretty cool
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:44:05
That's fair.

People like you keep citing how the FDIC will collapse, yet it had endured every challenge hurled at it.

Bitcoin will never replace the dollar and FDIC insured banks if the only thing you say to those who lost everything is "should have been smarter. Next time buddy." Average people want the stability of government backed accounts. The FDIC came into being for a reason.

Sure, all institutions may be safe for some of the time, some institutions will be safe all of the time, but all institutions will not be safe all of the time. You can Monday night quarterback the Super Bowl when talking about Gox, but mark my words there will be reputable institutions in the future that will fall to similar havoc or mischief. 
Working folk, people who don't have much to their name need organizations like the FDIC to protect them from the corrupt and the incompetent. 
I'm not anti bitcoin, but I have a problem with a lot of people trying to treat bitcoin as a vehicle to dismantle regulations that do protect the vast majority of people.

How do you explain the numerous bank panics of the 1800s

Ya know if he's lucky he'll be able to afford one of those nice big erasers.
