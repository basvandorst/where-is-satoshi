People without hearts like you make lose hope in the humble people like me. People against hate become despicable people because of the social rejection of people like you who only look after their own interests and do not care about anything apart of the economy of their family. We are all humans and you are part of my family believe it or not. The government brainwashes us every day to create people like you, who do not care about anything that is happening in the world because it simply does not affect them in any way and that is what we need to change. We must start to think a bit about other people although it does not affect us. Only by that way we can recover the hope on this world so neither you nor anyone will make me be a programmed robot without heart. I always will think by myself and will still fighting hard against the hate and injustices.

Im not using my time well since I am replying you because you dont know nothing about the case (although you say opposite) and if you approve a doble life sentenece for a guy with non-violent charges you need get a triple life sentence for non-violent charges and die 3 times in prision. Only by that way you can change your disgusting and ugly ape mind. Seriously dude, you are an unpleasant and really bad person that do not deserve even the air you breathe.

It's not okay to facilitate criminal activities without consequence but this sentence is far harsher than the punishment for many murderers, pedophiles, rapists and other violent people.

You right but we can help. In change.org you can find won petitions of poeple serving abusive sentences launched to the President of the United States. They get released! I speak of cases like Weldon Angelos: 
Timothy Tyler:  among others that you can find.

He profited with each transaction made in Silk Road but Ross is not dangerous to society and don't deserve die in prision. Even in the face of his walking death sentence, Ross clings to the hope of a **second chance** and dreams of a future where he can be reunited with his loved ones, and use his education, knowledge and skills to give to his community and society as a whole.
@_date: 2019-02-02 20:54:08
Why you think that? I am not saying that. I am saying that a person don't deserve to die in prision for non-violent charges. If you can not or dont want understand it dont waste your time saying foolishness please buddy.
@_date: 2019-02-02 16:15:16
I dont ubscuring nothing. The case timeline, charges, and any other details are available on freeross.org and everybody can see it. Ross make a mistake creating Silk Road but double life sentence plus 40 years without the possibility of parole for all non-violent charges and no criminal history is a horrible and exaggerated injustice. 
You must know that I am not defending a criminal, I am just defending the human rights. Ross must be judged for what he did but this sentence is purely meant to intimidate US citizens and is not, by any means, a form of justice.
@_date: 2019-02-02 19:20:58
He is guilty for creating Silk Road but we are talking about a double sentence life + 40 years. I am not saying that Ross is innocent. I am saying that the sentence for the Ross's charges are totally abusive and unacceptable.

During  the sentencing hearing, Judge Forrest also relied on unsubstantiated,  unproven allegations of overdose deaths allegedly connected to Silk  Road, stating that *“in some way, \[they\] related to Silk Road.”*[\[4\]](  Like the murder-for-hire allegations, these were never prosecuted,  charged or even mentioned at trial, and were based on what the appeal  calls an *“entirely subjective, undefined and unprecedented standard.”*[\[5\]](
Judge  Forrest rejected, and deemed irrelevant, a detailed 11-page forensic  pathology report that concluded the cause of death could neither be  scientifically determined nor linked to Silk Road.[\[6\]]( The defense called the accusations ***“incomplete, unreliable and inaccurate”***[\[7\]](  The judge did not cite a single case–despite the defense’s  objections–where even those who manage large, tangible drug  organizations are sentenced based on overdose deaths that are not part  of the charges, much less any as weak and unproven as these.
Even the Court of Appeals found some impact statements at sentencing **inappropriate**. Judge Gerald Lynch was concerned that parents’ testimony related to these deaths *“put an extraordinary thumb on the scale that shouldn’t be there”* and created *“an enormous emotional overload for something that’s effectively present in every heroin case.”*[\[8\]]( He asked *“Why does this guy get a life sentence?”* and went on to call the sentence *“quite a leap”*.[\[9\]](


 – Drug Policy Alliance &amp; Law Enforcement Action Partnership in a brief in support of the Supreme Court petition.[\[10\]](
This  fact-finding by Judge Forrest, and not the jury, violated Ross’s  constitutional rights. This type of  judicial overreach has been debated  over decades in the courts, and there is a long string of cases in  which judges have violated the Sixth Amendment in this way. If allowed  to stand, Judge Forrest’s sentence will bolster a destructive,  unconstitutional precedent.

I start this thread thinking that the people of this reddit community know who is Ross Ulbricht but I have edited the post to clarify that.
If you want know more information about the case go to freeross.org and do your own research.
@_date: 2019-02-03 10:11:08
I am so tired of people like you that is against Ross without an valid argument and you don't have an valid argument because you not even have investigate about the case. If you had done it you'd know that Ross is not a criminal like the godfather as you are saying. Ross is a guy without criminal record history that has not hurt anyone. People was used Silk Road to sell drugs but they don't work for Ross, they work for theyself and Ross was getting a comission with every transaction and end. You can not compare him with a godfather because its a very exaggerated big difference among them.

Blake Benthall, the admitted owner of Silk Road 2.0, a bigger replica of Silk Road and one of many dark net markets that proliferated after Ross’s sentencing, is a free man, released from custody after 13 days.

You can not give everyone the same relief but because everyone sentenced under federal sentencing are usually for violent crimes. Ross have non-violent charges and is serving double life sentencing.

I have memorized a passage that is appropriate for this occasion ... of Ezekiel 25:17: "The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know my name is Yahvé when I lay my vengeance upon thee."

Regardless of what you think about Ross or his case, does a double life sentence + 40 years it seem fair to you? Criminals kill people, rape, steal, etc and get released. Why a person with non-violent charges must die in prision? World is crazy...

The government violated Ross’s Fourth Amendment privacy rights before, during, and after his arrest, and repeatedly lied to the court about their investigation. The prosecutors, led by Preetinder Bharara—who served as Schumer’s Chief Counsel for five years—used unprosecuted, unproven allegations of arranging murders that never actually occurred (and were recently dismissed) to deny Ross bail, smear him in the media, prejudice his jurors and justify the double life sentence he ultimately received.
@_date: 2019-02-02 16:47:53
People kill people and get released.
They can not made an example out of him.
Ross does not represent a danger to society and less after seeing the consequences that involve committing break the law in the United States of America.
@_date: 2019-04-05 16:20:58
That does not justify this sentence.

And what you fucking mean? We are talking about a double life sentence plus 40 years, without the possibility of parol for non-violent crimes,  the corrupt government  involved in the judgment lying and making false accusations to get a bigger sentence and get the media brainwashing people like you so now you are saying what they want it.

I don't pretend watering down the truth but you do not must do it either. You are saying: - He sold drugs.
When the only true is that the first product offered on the site was mushrooms he grew himself, and he sold them. But when you say that he sold drugs you are watering down the truth because the people who do not know nothing about this case can think he was drug dealer and he is not that. He just sold some mushrooms at the beginning of the market but that was all. You can not tell that he sold drugs for that reason, you must say,  specifically,  that at the beginning of all he sold mushrooms. That would be correct and true words. Ross is not  innocent but if you talk about truth you know what's the truth? Who is Ross in reality?  I'll tell you, Ross he is a bright boy with many good ideas but because of misfortunes he made the worst mistake of his life when he decided create Silk Road. Neither he nor anyone else could have imagined the consequences which represents a drug free market because it was something non-existent and the humans love to make mistakes all the time. You and me included.

Dude, what I'm saying is that I'm against the sale of drugs considered illegal . I know the caffeine is also a drug but we live in a world surrounded of hypocrisy and ignorance. The goverment decide if it's a drug or not, they decide if they are going to violate your rights and destroy your life completely as they have done with Ross or not. They live and we only obey as programmed robots so before to be able to make our own criteria regarding drugs, we must to wake up our conscience to be able to decide anything thinking in a free way by yourself.  I personally do not believe in all drugs should be legal (especially  the dangerous) but I understand you when you say that cuz you are looking for a free world.

I love when I see that there are still good people awake. We all need a lucid and realistic consciousness. The world is so subject to misfortune because of drugs and the deceptions of a system that manipulates through consumerism, the media, fashions and propaganda tendencies. They make us and build at their whim but like Charles Chaplis said: "Machine men, with brains and machine hearts, you are not machines, you are not sheep, you are men! You carry the love of humanity in your hearts, not hatred. Only those who do not love hate. Those who do not love and the inhuman."

You should inform yourself better because you are wrong. Check this and then let me know what you think:
In Silk Road was prohibited CP and murder and  anyone who knows a little about the case know it.  Making these kinds of accusations shows that you do not even know the rules and ideology of Ross marketplace.
@_date: 2019-09-24 15:42:14
You should learn more about the case because the court was reject proofs and appeals without plead any reason and we are talking about a sentence of double life imprisonment + 40 years. The evidence from his own laptop didn't show that Ross tried to order any murder but nevertheless  he received the worst and unfair sentence based on that accusation which was dismissed. In short, Ross was tried for an dismissed accusation  that although it was dismissed, that convinced the jury that he tried to commit murders so call it conspiracy or what you want, but that's the reallity.
@_date: 2019-09-28 23:16:40
Again, Mr. Scatterbrain; The evidence for the attempted murders does not prove that Ross is the author of those messages because the DRP account was used by several different people and therefore, as it cannot be shown that Ross is guilty of that and the only person using the DRP account, the charges of murder were dismissed. If the prosecution could demonstrate, it would, but it simply cannot because there are more people involved. I wonder why you put so much effort into blaming Ross justifying a death sentence in prison. He is guilty of creating an internet drug market and deserve pay for what he did but use an accusation without valid evidence to consolidate a double life sentence it's worse than any crime you can imagine cuz that shows how rotten are the minds that are entrusted with enforcing justice.
@_date: 2019-09-21 21:58:06


Ross not try to have people killed, DRP account was used by multiple people (including corrupt secret service agents) and Ross defense could prove it but the court reject that proofs to avoid show how rotten is their feds. The press and media was responsible for defame the image of Ross so anyone who want research about the case just find lies and half truths. I dont think Ross is inoccent, but it is clear that he was judged unfairly and that the justice system has brutally violated his rights condemning him to die in prison regardless of whether he is really guilty of ordering murders because although those charges were dropped everybody knows that  his "exemplary sentence" was taken based in those allegations so what we got here is a corrupt justice sytem killing a first time offender without matters the truth.
@_date: 2019-09-28 23:39:06
Your argument is poor, useless and unsuccessful just like yourself. You just know what the press let you know ignoring the facts that must be considered before approve a doble life sentence for non-violent offenses charges so get out here. You can resort to insulting me because that is how you demonstrate how pathetic and insignificant your crazy monkey brain can be.
@_date: 2019-09-24 14:54:47
If you check [change.org]( you can find a lot of petitions launched for help other persons imprisioned for lesser non-violent offenses. I can not understand what you mean with your comment and without offending I think it's useless and irreverent for this conversation.
@_date: 2019-09-28 22:27:41
You are approving to judge someone for dismissed charges. You don't care if Ross is innocent or if the evidence that exists is not enough because they involve more people using the DRP account and you can't prove if it really was him. Nor do you care if the evidence was manipulated by the secret service before being delivered to the court. I bet you don't even know the constitution of the United States, because with this case the fifth amendment is being violated and you agree with all that. It is as if I accuse you of murder and the judge withdraws the charges but judges you considering that you can be a dangerous murderer. Go learn a bit of laws and human rights before giving your opinion.

HSI agent Jared Der-Yeghiayan, the lead Silk Road investigator, spent  two years investigating Silk Road, and thousands of hours working undercover as a Silk Road employee, interacting with those behind the  DPR accounts on a daily basis. Throughout his lengthy [investigation]( Der-Yeghiayan’s main target behind the DPR accounts wasn’t Ross, but a man named Mark Karpeles and his associate Ashley Barr. Der-Yeghiayan also testified that he believed someone new assumed control of the DPR accounts the year of Ross’s arrest, supporting the defense’s argument that DPR’s identity changed over time. Check this before talk please:
YOU don't know nothing about the case so stop talking because you're getting ridiculous acting like a mindless.
@_date: 2019-09-25 15:11:11
DPR was an account used by several people. They found that Ross was one of those people, but they could not prove that he was responsible for those messages because there are more people involved using DPR account.  You only know what the articles say and you blindly believe in a corrupt system that cheats you and your family every day but like every human in this world, until you suffer in your own skin the injustices that are committed by the system that must defend us in violation of your human rights, you will never understand so keep acting like a sheep forgetting the details that involve corruption from the system instead of thinking for yourself. You are a blind sheep and honestly I think that nothing can be done to save your so rotten brain, so I just will stop to waste my time arguing with a stone like you.
@_date: 2019-09-28 00:41:58
We are talking about the lead Silk Road investigator, not an investigators opinion like you say. HSI agent Jared Der-Yeghiayan spent two years investigating Silk Road working as undercover and interacting with DRP accounts on a daily basis so their opinion is very important and must be considered seriously by the jury. You are approving a double life sentence without matter if the guy was guilty or innocent and leaving aside very important details about the corruption in this case. I can not understand why exists the people like you, you can have diferent opinion in any topic but you always must think by yourself and do not act like a scheduled sheep.  If I thought that Ross is really guilty of the accusation that caused his terrible condemnation (although they eventually dismissed the charges)  I would give my opinion considering all points of view instead pay attention only to the press and television. The press and television lie and exaggerate the news to gain audience. You don't need to be a genius to know. We all know how it works and that is why we must reason ourselves. People like you prefer others to think for you, maybe you are too lazy or just don't want to see the true reality and that is awful but we don't have to lose hope in humanity. We must learn to help each other to think by ourselves and do not matter how much does it cost. The good and conscious people will always keep trying.
