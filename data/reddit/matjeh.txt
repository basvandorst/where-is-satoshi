Would you mind detailing your safe storage practises?

Of course, but It's not just the end-users of Bitcoin which make the errors.

Where is it documented in the terms and conditions of the account that "Personal/current bank accounts should not be used frequently."?

Great point, I think this is a very important point that few people seem to be aware of  With a small piece of software, reading every 32-byte chunk from the disk, using it as a private key, generating the corresponding public key and checking the blockchain for unspent transactions is very feasible. Deleting your files is not enough - get DBAN and wipe it.  If in doubt, mutilate it.
One can use fulldisk encryption to make this process quicker, that way all you need to do when you RMA/sell a disk is to overwrite the (small) encryption key.  But this creates another point of failure of key management.

Very insightful, thanks :) I use a very similar process myself, after learning the hard way.  Paranoia/academic reasons additionally motivated me to create my own offline private key/address conversion signing program.

At today's difficulty, ((23844670039 * ( 2^32 ))/4)/(3600 * 24 * 365.25) =

I ran bitcoind on a Linux server shared by other users.  One of the other accounts had a weak password and eventually the server was rooted.  My wallet was encrypted, but the balance was still stolen because the attacker replaced /usr/bin/bitcoind with their own version which sent all UTXO to an address as soon as the wallet was unlocked.  I unlocked my wallet one day to sign a message with a private key, and noticed the balance was 0.
The 20 BTC lesson I got from this is never to keep more than necessary on a networked computer, especially one which other people can access.
Generate private keys on devices which are permanently offline, use BIP38 to store those keys, and spread your coins over a few addresses to reduce risk.
Store 'canary' private keys with a few bucks worth and monitor those for activity to indicate a security compromise.

I'd be happier sending to  '1667dggwAuUzsrcc1Ujmdj1pX6qecCdKz8' than ''billing because there is a built-in 32-bit checksum to catch a typo or copy/paste error with 99.99999998% certainty ( (1- 1/(2^32) )*100 ) rather than silently accepting my irreversible transaction to a wrong email-style address.

I think we have differing opinions of a 'wrong address'

Using an encrypted wallet on the same machine which is vulnerable/compromised is no use either; the attackers can simply replace the bitcoin software with a custom version which sends to an address of their choice as soon as the wallet is unlocked.  No keyloggers or wallet cracking required.  This is how I lost all my bitcoins, from a Linux machine with an encrypted wallet on a separate user account.

Out of interest, why did you choose btcguild over any other pool?

The "The Well Deserved Fortune of Satoshi Nakamoto" page states that based on the trend of the ExtraNonce field on those blocks, there is some indication that Satoshi's mining program was restarted every 100 hours or so, "probably to backup the wallet".
However, a responsible person would have deleted the private keys to those early mining addresses so that they would have no chance to fall into the hands of an irresponsible person, capable of destabilising the Bitcoin economy from the result of mass cash-out.
If Satoshi has the foresight that he demonstrably has, by creating Bitcoin in the first place, then the act of mining those early blocks was done purely for the purpose of confirming transactions rather than accruing Bitcoins, and instead of backing up the wallet every 100 hours, maybe it was to shred the wallet.

For the outputs of transactions in a block to be spendable, the previous hash field in the block header needs to refer to a valid block, but since it was the first block, that field is 0 which is invalid, so the output of the generation transaction is not spendable.

Is there _any_ type of fiat transfer that isn't reversible, other than hard currency?

This is a simple and great idea which would protect end-users.

It means you found a share of difficulty 245, which meets the difficulty 31 requirement of the pool for share submissions.  You should see relatively many near to 31 and higher numbers dropping off exponentially.  If you see a 22M/31 , then you have found a block, at today's difficulty :)

Exactly, copy only the wallet.dat to a clean machine which has been installed from known-good media.  It's annoying but the safest way.

A quantum computer wouldn't need to mine.  Quantum computers can utilize Shor's algorithm for computing discrete logarithms, so the ECDSA algorithm used to calculate keypairs would be compromised.  It would just find the corresponding ECDSA private keys for the public keys in the block chain and be able to spend the balance from any address.  This is something quantum computers can do far more efficiently than classical computers.

Assuming your password was standard printable ASCII (codes 32-127) there would be 96^10 (66483263599150104576) combinations of passwords.  If your password was hashed once with SHA256 then at 10^18 hashes/sec, you could brute-force a 10 character password in 66.5 seconds.

I've just downloaded it (@ 2013-05-11 16:57:28 UTC) and the hash matches, using sha1sum on Linux.  How are you downloading it?
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:51:25
No, because the transactions and thus the merkle root hash would be different for solo-mining.
