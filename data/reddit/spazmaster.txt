Great! Just one tip. Your uncle really needs to pick other pictures. There are way better ones in the slideshow but he the starting pictures are dull and make the rooms look really small.

Too bad my mother doesn't know what World of Warcraft is. :P

Yeah, it's instabuy. I kept looking for the buy button, but the moment you transfer money from your cc, it buys the BTC, and you can use the BTC right away.
After I discovered I already owned the BTC I realized how simple this was and took my hat off to Circle.

It's probably less than 1%. I live in Arnhem, and bought my first btc early 2011. We have a few enthusiasts here in Arnhem, and Dutch merchants are open to new things.
It's great we have that many merchants accepting btc in my home town, but few of them have stopped accepting.
The public don't do much with btc. This many bars and restaurants accepting btc is really cool, but not something that is known outside the bitcoin enthusiasts here.

One of the reasons we include a link to blockchain.info so you can verify if it's the right address.

I'm bullshitting?

A lot of cherry picking. One thing that is very important is transaction volume in fiat currency, which has been stable.

Yes, we are aware of that. One of our top to do's is enabling SSL. We'll have that within the next 24h.
@_date: 2014-01-07 12:57:57
Yes, we will open source this in the near future. I love open sourcing our projects, see for example:

I used NFC this week. I held my card there and *bling* the transaction had been approved. I didn't even have to use my PIN Number. That's way easier than the 4-5 actions I need to take with my phone to pay with BTC. (which I also did last week)

I'll post an update once it's open sourced!
@_date: 2014-08-23 21:16:38
Nice. I'll be joining the fray :)

Sorry, wasn't trying to pretend that would solve the issue. It definitely needs more thought and safe guards.

Weird, must have been my cache...didn't see that previous tweet.

This is great news. This Friday we're having a Bitcoin event in Arnhem ( We'll be scouring all joints accepting Bitcoin, and spend us some bits!

Googling for bitcoin address shortener shows a not working service as first result. The other results are functional but don't have an appealing and easy to use interface. I thought shortcoin.io could fill the gap and offer something that you could easily use on your phone or tablet as well.
It's very barebones at the moment and would like to build this site out with features. I know man-in-the-middle attacks are a concern so I'd like to add security features along the way. Please let me know what you guys would like us to add to the shortcoin.io in the near future.
Also any feedback is welcome!

Armory also offers consultancy services and could set this up for you. You should give them a call.

Even as an existing customer the promotion worked. Thanks!
