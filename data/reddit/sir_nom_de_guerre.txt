Agreed, sounds about right xd

that's why Bitcoin Cash is named BCH if im not mistaken?

very kind of him, it's nice to see some productive thing like this as a money-making method
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:24:40
Very nice, laughed so hard!
@_date: 2017-08-05 13:33:41
Another nice one

I don't know, because it's standard?
How are they doing it then?
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:56:10
same here, error 500 for a while now, does anybody have any more info?
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:52:36
karma is a bi*ch right? :)

Some can, but those models cost much more then we could afford at a time, and we had no interest in doing so even if we did.. we dont even ask for sms verification
@_date: 2017-09-07 09:32:50
the last reason should be enough...

We got a bitxatm, but i would not recommend it again. We had alot of problems and the support is awfully slow

I dont like to share personal information online, so country answer is a no no :)
You would need about 1000$ cash minimal and as much btc as you can get, preferably at least 2 BTC since sometimes people want to buy exactly 1.0 btc
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:32:59
Both of them? :)
@_date: 2017-09-22 19:36:00
i own a bitx ATM in Europe, we've never had "lines" but demand is steadily increasing, and interest is sparking at exponential rates :)
@_date: 2017-09-23 17:50:19
No licenses, no taxes, nothing
The only additional costs besides buying the atm is the cash and btc to “fill it up”, plus renting a van to deliver it where you need

Google some manufacturers and decide for yourself, depends how much money you have at your disposal

was planning to start with fliers, and the idea about social media bitcoin news is good, thanks macUser999 :)
@_date: 2017-07-29 08:09:58
the free bitcoin classes would collude a little with my new blockchain consulting firm i'm starting, but some basics maybe..
and as far as fees go, i'll consider it..
@_date: 2017-07-29 08:13:16
nice one :)

the cost was approx. €5000, plus there is about 1000€ in cash in local currency and about €3500 in bitcoin on it
location is a very nice bar, nothing super fancy like those modern 5$ coffee places, it's a home-design bar with a lot of craft beers, free peanuts and popcorn etc.
as far as advertisement goes you are right, but young people here mostly dont have enough money here to get into bitcoin at any level (not just bitcoin, financial speculation/investment of any type for that matter), so that audience is out of the  picture (unless they are already in bitcoin somehow, defeating the purpose of advertising bitcoin to them)

South eastern Europe, i'm not quite comfortable saying more since there isn't alot of atm's here or in neighboring country's so finding out who i am wouldn't be a problem
by business i meant the amount of BTC exchanged, both on the ATM and in "live" transactions (alot of people come personally to exchange after we meet over the ATM, mostly them calling for help with something they dont understand or want to know more about btc)
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:47:55
the lack of competition makes that a negligible problem
@_date: 2017-07-29 10:02:12
Hmm, not bad at all sir, thank you :)
@_date: 2017-07-29 08:12:21
would you mind explaining it a bit further?
