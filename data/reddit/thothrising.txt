For the kickstarter I do have funding options for just getting a microSD card with the image, although I didn't offer a 64GB version for also storing the blockchain partly for the reason mentions.
I had thought about building a simple web interface, and maybe I will still add that later for download, I do think that would be a nice feature (and I think bitseed has something like that on theirs).

Yeah, rpi2 still costs, but it can be a little cheaper if you don't mind getting one without an external screen:

Most cable or high speed connections actually have enough bandwidth (at least in the US, for now) to handle a full node, but definitely not all. If you are stuck on Verizon DSL or something like that, you wouldn't, which sucks. I have Comcast and bandwidth has not been an issue for running a full node at all.

Is it? Because the layout of the Ethernet and USB ports don't line up for either their v1 or v2 to the Odroid C1. And they list different specs (1GHz ARMv7 rather than 1.5GHz, and Mali 400 rather than Mali 450).

There are two kinds of "forks" in play here. There is a software/protocol fork, and a blockchain fork. Blockchain forks, which happen frequently, are when multiple chains are being worked on at the same time, and they get "resolved" when one chain becomes longer and "wins".
Software/protocol forks are when different software gets used that uses rules not compatible with other software. When the software fork lets things mingle a little, as in this case, you also get blockchain forks.
In this case, when you create a transaction, there won't be two records for your history or anything like that. If the bitcoin network fully split in two, you'd either be using one or the other and things would get messy for users until that was resolved. In the case of the block size increase, there wouldn't really be a full split of the network. Your transaction would get included in either a block of 2MB or a larger block. If that block got incorporated into the longest chain, then all is well. If not, that transaction could get tossed back into the unconfirmed txs, but would most likely eventually get included in a block that ended in the longest chain.
Basically, there might be some "turbulence" in the plumbing, but there wouldn't be anything like double histories or whatever you are thinking.

Perhaps, my patent-ese is a bit rusty so hard to tell. No mention of hierarchical wallets in the patent, but patents are written to be as inclusive as possible so I can see a patent lawyer wanting to open up the wording to any way of generating addresses.
However it doesn't look like there is a Transaction Proposal or other aspects of BIP45 in the patent.
And there seems to be parts in the patent that don't really fit in with BIP45. (I did just a quick read through of BIP45, so I could have missed some things).
If it is an implementation of BIP45, it sounds like BitPay already has implemented it and it is a public spec. I am still uncertain how prior art is defined since we (the US) moved to a first to file patent system (and the patent lawyers I've talked to have confirmed that they are unsure as well, which isn't exactly comforting), but I would think the BIP45 being on github would count.

I suppose so, in the sense that an asteroid coming "close" to the earth is potentially extremely scary. It is scary because if it hit, we'd be screwed, but the likely of that happening is so low that we ought not be scared.
However, while bitcoin does not come close to the number of people working on something like Linux, it could become (or may already be) one of the largest cooperative efforts humanity has undertaken. Not only is it an open source project where many programmers are contributing directly to bitcoin core, but it is also a wider service and software ecosystem and a participatory environment of miners, full nodes, users, and so on that have a "say" in its future.
I agree, let us hope its users are wise enough to reject harmful changes, but also that the system is built (as best as can be) to withstand malicious activity and grows at a pace which allows that.
Either way, for those of us participating in the ecosystem in any way, this is a thrilling time.

Plus extra scripts that monitor bitcoind and restart it if it crashes, etc...
But sure if you think this is a "scam" because I'm not offering everything for exactly the price I pay for it, then I guess all businesses are scams. If $120 is worth it to someone to not have to spend the afternoon building it themselves, they have this option. If not, I've posted full DIY steps.

If there were only 3 nodes you would only see 2 connections. 2 Connections means no shortage, right?
You'll see more or less connections as the network fluctuates, not because it has too many or too few.


It doesn't work like that. Decentralized systems have properties that emerge from the network. The fewer nodes, the more open to various attacks and manipulations (like gov't intervention).
I don't know what the magic number is, but you definitely can't use your number of connections as any indication of network strength.
@_date: 2015-05-13 15:13:06
You have a bandwidth and data limit? Ouch!
I hear you though, for a time I lived in an area with only one ISP and it was really bad. I rarely got even 1Mb download, but there wasn't anything I could do because, like in your case, there was no other option.
I'd say you're doing the right thing for the bitcoin network. If bandwidth or data limits are a concern, definitely not the best place for a full node to be running.

It looks like some swap is on by default in Debian Wheezy.
If someone wanted to run 'make -j4' when building bitcoin on the raspberry pi, they would need to increase the swap size or it will run out of memory. Otherwise I've not had any issues after many builds and testing.
You should consider posting a tutorial for building it on the ODroid C1, I think there might be some people interested in building a full node on that board rather than a raspberry pi.
@_date: 2015-05-01 16:26:48
Thanks. I like to get detailed with my tuts and give lots of info (like letting people know when a step will take an hour or so) and give some indication of what is happening so people can learn as they go.
@_date: 2015-05-01 01:55:07
Yeah, I rushed typing that. It looks like one of the things they are talking about is using PUSH and DROP to store/record encrypted public keys in the blockchain, as in this example they give:
OP_PUSHDATA(message) OP_DROP OP_DUP OP_HASH160 OP_PUSHDATA(pubKeyHash)
OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG

Looks like a kick ass ice cream sandwich! Although I kindda liked the almost industrial-esque look of the first version.
Anyway, off topic:
Bitseed [mentions on their preorder page]( that:
"The bitcoin blockchain has grown to over 26GB in size"
I'm curious why the "26"?
Blockchain.info has the blockchain size at [around 33]( and it actually takes up currently around 41GB on my server.
@_date: 2015-05-01 06:13:45
Sweet, I've had a DIY raspberry pi site up for a while too:
Another option that I include, although it raises the price, is to store the blockchain on an external USB drive rather than a 64GB microSD card. With the blockchain at 41GB, having grown 11GB in the last 4 months, it will most likely break 64GB before the year ends.
If people want the bitcoin-Qt GUI, they can get that running on the rpi2 as well, with just a few extra steps.
@_date: 2015-05-21 16:13:30
Really? Thanks for the note. I've curled that line from an rpi and ran it and didn't have any issues, but I'll check the website and see if I can replicate the issue and fix it.
@_date: 2015-05-13 14:59:44
You wouldn't have to update anything, but I don't have it set to automatically update itself.
To automatically update bitcoin core to new releases on the ARM architecture would require some more work, since you can't just add their PPA, but instead have to build core on the platform. I'll think about that though, but it isn't essential to upgrade (unless there is a hard fork, like the 20MB increase, in which case I could find a way to release an update for easy download).
@_date: 2015-05-08 14:41:50
From who? If there were only 2 other nodes in the network, then who else is there to connect to you? No one, just those nodes.
@_date: 2015-05-08 05:48:08
Just because the max block size is increased doesn't mean blocks will be 20MBs. 160GB should last a while (although they use some of that to back up some data in case of a power outage). They mention a possible upgrade to 250GB for their v2, for $20 more I think.
@_date: 2015-05-14 20:15:51
A lot of tech companies don't track time off, it's been somewhat common for years now. They are trying to attract people who are highly skilled and who WANT to build something awesome. This means they want people that they don't have to babysit.
Anyone who sees "unlimited time off" and thinks, "so I don't have to work" is exactly who they don't want to hire.
Those who see "unlimited time off" and think, "so I can work when I am most productive and handle other aspects of my life when I need to rather than force a 9-5 schedule" are the kind of people they want.
@_date: 2015-05-04 17:11:57
Yeah, it depends. If your wallet is a full node (like bitcoin core) then you need to make the decision to update or not. However if your wallet is an SPV or a service that calls out to an actual full node to transmit the transaction, you won't (and can't) do anything either way. It is the node that is transmitting that may or may not honor the updated software/protocol.
@_date: 2015-05-01 00:57:50
I think these reactions may be a little excessive. Upon more detailed reading, while the patent mentions P2SH, it is obviously not trying to patent P2SH or multisig. The bulk of the patent seems to be about how to distribute, generate, and store keys on networked (web based) devices in a way that allows for security as well as convenience. This would allow for backups, account recovery, and tiered use of services, and they give some examples in the patent.
While my own personal belief is that patents are overall not beneficial, we have a patent system and this patent does not seem to tread on P2SH, multisig, or other prior art.
@_date: 2015-05-05 17:09:07
I'm not trying to undercut bitseed by posting a DIY (I actually mention bitseed and link to their personal server in the FAQ section). I think what they've built is awesome and the fact you can just plug it in without any expertise or understanding is awesome. I'm glad they, and those who buy the bitseed personal server, are supporting bitcoin.
Some people like to tinker and build things themselves, and may already have a rpi2 or just don't quite have the cash for a bitseed personal server.
Again, the OP claimed he couldn't run a full node cheaper himself, I was merely pointing out that he could, not that he should or ought to have done that rather than support bitseed.
@_date: 2015-05-04 00:14:56
Basically there are many different versions of the same software running bitcoin (because new updates are added and some people update their software more or less than othes), and there are multiple software programs that "run" bitcoin in that they interact with the network and do the job of some piece of the bitcoin network (full node, miner, etc...).
These all exist because bitcoin is a protocol, a set of rules that everyone agrees to which allows all these computers to communicate in a meaningful way. This is much like the Internet/networking.
TCP, UDP, BGP, HTTP, etc... are all protocols that different actors (software/hardware) implement to communicate and build the Internet.
A hard fork is when there is a proposed change to those protocols that is not backward compatible, meaning it isn't an add on new rule, but a change to older rules (this isn't exactly right, but we're going for ELI5 here).
When that happens, all actors (hardware/software) that uses the protocol must change to the new rules, or stay with the old. But those that stay with the old can't work right with those that move to the new, so you get two bitcoin networks, in a sense, which is the "fork".
To someone who holds or uses bitcoin, this might sound scary, but it isn't. This is common for the "plumbing" of a decentralized and complex system. Users and holders most likely won't be impacted, they probably won't notice anything unless something goes wrong and we really do end up with a significant fraction of the bitcoin network on both sides, some refusing to update, others updating and refusing to go back.
@_date: 2015-05-11 15:39:44
The bitseed is definitely a good option.
If you want to set up a raspberry pi node, very detailed DIY steps with plenty of options can be found [here](
The steps getting a node up on something like the raspberry pi are long because you have to build the program so it can run on the rpi's CPU. If you get a standard PC, the steps to install and run are much simpler. For Ubuntu for example they are:






More install steps can be found at [running a full node](

Translating directly into power costs in USD, the rpi2 consumes around 1 penny a day, 2 pennies a day if you live in California.
Bitcoin core does use all 4 cores when initially verifying the blockchain, although it doesn't need them once it is up to date.
And you can add an external USB HD, it's pretty straightforward.

I'm actually kinda shocked people kept reporting this as a Branson event. You can tell by the website, and the "M" logo at the top, and the two cofounders of MaiTai Global that are on the list of attendees are 2 of the 5 hosts, that the event is put on by [MaiTai Global](
I think it is a little inaccurate to say "some non bitcoin person" since one of the cofounders of MaiTai Global is on BitFury's board of directors.
Kashmir Hill definitely hasn't helped because she only refers to Mai as only a "kiteboarder" since it helps sell her agenda, rather than as a cofounder and president of MaiTai Global which is probably a little more relevant in this context.

Thanks for a declaration that the intent isn't to do so, although not sure it will quell the reddit-spasm that has gone on.
The problem on this thread was that all conclusions were formed from the title, rather than anyone actually looking at the patent themselves (or reserving judgement until someone else who understood patent-ese could speak up).
As mentioned, when I read through it, it didn't look to me like it was an application to patent multisig either, but when I didn't see an anticipated clear statement of that even I started worrying.
@_date: 2015-05-06 03:35:28
It's a different board than the rpi2, but similar specs (I think same chipset, but not positive).
They do mention a new web interface on [the preorder page](

Perhaps, but there seems to be no shortage of patents that at least reference bitcoin:
[Google patent search on bitcoin](
I haven't read past the abstract, but on the first page an application entitled [Offline Virtual Currency Transaction]( probably ought to be more worrying than the BitGo application which actually isn't trying to patent multisig or P2SH anyway.
@_date: 2015-05-13 16:09:07
Thanks @_date: 2015-05-07 01:01:35
I can't find any patent application under their name, so it is tough to tell what exactly they are trying to patent. If they are trying to patent their specific altcoin, no worries here.
On a side note, I can't figure out the benefit of blockchain technology for this. If they need a decentralized currency for a marketplace, they should use bitcoin. But it seems like it is literally just reward points... which means there is no benefit to a blockchain. It is much better to just run a centralized rewards service, MySQL works better here.
@_date: 2015-05-13 04:54:36
Cool, I just launched a kickstarter for essentially the same thing: [raspnode kickstarter](
And [bitseed]( already sells a bitcoin node, although they don't use a raspberry pi 2, but a different board (although with almost identical specs). Bitseed says they have added a nice web page to check status and use the wallet, so that might be a feature to add if you're up to it.
@_date: 2015-05-13 13:39:18
Thanks. And if not, there is still the [bitseed]( which I think is a good deal as well.
Either way it was fun putting it together.
@_date: 2015-05-05 22:23:53
In what way?
Bandwidth isn't a concern. Storage is based on what you plug in (a hard drive is a hard drive), and running a full node on a rpi2 with over 70 connections sits around 10% cpu, spiking to 30% for a second when a block comes in... so not even using half of one of the 4 cores it has.
A full node on an rpi2 performs exactly as any other "high end" computer does at this point in time.
@_date: 2015-05-13 13:27:05
For those who would rather build it themselves, I also have detailed DIY steps on the website:

@_date: 2015-05-13 15:59:52
That's along the lines I was thinking. Agree it shouldn't be auto, should be a notification with the user's choice to update when they wish.
Rather than check on boot, because the hope for the network is that most will run this 24/7, I would probably stick to the out of band notification... with perhaps an added notification on the node in case emails get out of date. I'd probably have a cron job to check my site for updates perhaps once a day, and if there is an update alert the user on next login.
@_date: 2015-05-01 18:17:04
This clearly adds to the discussion, so people ought to use proper reddiquette and upvote even if they disagree.
I've attempted to be a voice of reason here, first by actually reading the patent and trying to get at the core of the invention being patented. While my initial readings led me to believe it is focused on the distribution and storage/transmission of keys for use in P2SH, and not trying to patent something like multisig, your response leaves me worried.
It doesn't take much for the authors or BitGo themselves to come out and just state, for the record, that the patent is not intending to patent multisig. However you did not. Dancing around that by saying "if there is prior art..." surely doesn't help.
@_date: 2015-05-14 04:26:12
@_date: 2015-05-13 02:00:51
I think you're onto something neat with your core idea. Although while Amazon has datacenters all over the world, they still only have so many, and spinning up multiple nodes in the same geo, under the same power/internet connection isn't really a boost to decentralization.
Perhaps if there was a way to convince companies to either run a full node on their existing computers, while they use them for work, and run them 24/7, and have some service that monitors that, perhaps they could write off the power used? I'm not sure how to do that though, but I think you are onto something. Maybe you need to argue that boosting the bitcoin network is beneficial to humanity... tough to argue that to the government!
I actually just [launched a kickstarter]( for a rpi full node, similar to the bitseed but cheaper with modular storage. I'm just doing it for fun, but perhaps, as mentioned, having companies run or buy inexpensive full nodes could factor into it? I've also got a [detailed DIY]( as well, so anyone can build their own, if that were to factor into your idea.
@_date: 2015-05-05 17:03:03
Of course the $50 difference is in part for the time spent doing it yourself. I wasn't trying to say that $150 was a bad price, I think it is a great price for the bitseed personal server. The OP just said he couldn't do it cheaper himself, I was pointing out he could.
And bitcoin doesn't exactly require the massive IOPS that would make USB 2.0 an issue.
@_date: 2015-05-05 06:59:18
You can do it cheaper, around $100, if you are into DIY builds and don't mind spending the time to hack it together yourself:

Oh, I see your concern. Home Internet ToS usually mean a web server or email server, but I guess they could interpret "server" really loosely. I haven't heard of any ISP doing that yet, but it's possible. You could always reach out to their support and ask if a bitcoin full node would be considered against their ToS and see what they say.
@_date: 2015-05-01 16:27:49

The patent is not for P2SH or multisig, it has something to do with the generation, storage, and distribution and use of keys for security and other reasons.
@_date: 2015-05-01 02:25:32
Yes, and it isn't trying to patent multisig or P2SH.
@_date: 2015-05-13 19:45:52
Yes, it's USB 2.0 (rpi2 only has 2.0 so a 3.0 stick doesn't get you more except if you load the blockchain from another source onto it), and that is more than enough. It's faster than the class 10 microSD card with the OS.
@_date: 2015-05-01 17:31:56
As stated earlier, IANAL. Although I do have some patents and have worked with a few patent lawyers. However I also don't want to speak on behalf of BitGo. I still think the best course of action, no matter how narrow or broad the patent may be, is to send information to the patent office for their review.
With patent-ese, it is often difficult to figure out exactly what it is for, but be pretty sure of what it isn't for. However, the claims on this patent are much shorter and more general than is usually the case (which is saying a lot, since the point of claims from a patent lawyer or inventor's perspective is to be as general as possible). So I can't know for sure how a patent examiner or court would interpret these. Odds are they will not get all their claims anyway, it will be sent back and they will have to drop some of them.
Anyway, I don't feel confident to ELI5 this, but the bulk appears to be a system that does heavily use multisig vi P2SH, but it isn't multisig that is the core of what is being patented.
The patent describes a system where you would sign up and the backend creates some private keys and encrypts them, and generates some public addresses (P2SH) and associates those with your account. The keys are then split up, say one on your mobile phone, one on their servers, maybe one on another device, etc... Then say you wish to send money. Your mobile phone reaches out and asks for the priv keys it needs from these other devices. They come back encrypted, and when you (or your phone) using a password, it decrypts them, signs a transaction, sends that transaction to another device for further key use and signing, then transmits the transaction. Or something like that. It is designed to be flexible in number of keys and different devices storing them. Sine this uses M of N multisig (P2SH), it can be used for backups, tiered settings on an account so if you wish to send only X amount, one priv key is needed, but if you wish to send Y&gt;X amount, maybe you need permission and another device needs to sign.
Other parts of the patent seem to describe various other measures such as key rotation, embedding pub keys in the blockchain, etc...
It would be nice to hear from BitGo exactly what they believe the full reach is, of course most companies don't want to talk about a product before it is released, but the patent was spotted and plenty of negative press is going on, so it might be in their best interest to say something.

I think you might have had some other issue with your Wifi setup. An Ethernet connection can usually handle more bandwidth than a home Wifi setup (meaning it has greater potential to dominate your Internet bandwidth). Any decent Wifi router should offer orders of magnitude more bandwidth than what you get from your ISP, so whether you are running your node on Ethernet or Wifi shouldn't change how it impacts your Internet connection. I'd bet those in your house on Wifi are either in a bad location and have a weak signal, or you may have some issue with the Wifi on your router.
@_date: 2015-07-12 17:43:20
It will actually take around a week to download the full blockchain on a rpi2, no joke. Best option is to run bitcoin core on your laptop or desktop, download the full blockchain, then transfer that to an external device for the rpi2.
Also, bitcoind (or qt) may crash while you are downloading the full blockchain and you'll have to restart it, possibly many times. Once the blockchain is caught up this should no longer be an issue.
It's not the CPU that is the main issue here despite what some think, if you have the full blockchain and reindex it, it doesn't take very long at all.

Tougher to do a plug and play Wifi setup than Ethernet. Normally a person would have to at least select their network and enter their passphrase. With Ethernet the step of cabling it to your router functions as selecting the network, and DHCP does the rest.

Keep in mind the 2GB minimum is assuming common OSes like Windows/OSX/Ubuntu which use a good amount of RAM. Raspbian (Debian Wheezy) is a stripped down OS built to run on the Raspberry Pi A, which only had 256Mb of RAM. 1GB is slim, but it works just fine. Bitcoin generally uses between 60-70% of that 1GB, occasionally jumping to over 80%. There will come a point where 1GB is too little, but we're not there yet.
As mentions, the 1GB does become a problem if you decide to download the entire blockchain on the rpi2. During that time it can crash and need to be restarted. However I was able to run mine through the spam attack (although during that period, it did go into swap a little, but normally it does not).

Full nodes and miners are two different (and integral) parts of the bitcoin network. There is no bitcoin reward for running a full node, just the fact that you help keep the network decentralized, secured from various attacks, and functioning. Your "reward" is that you keep bitcoin alive and can use it.
Full nodes keep a copy of the blockchain, verify the blocks that miners mine, relay those blocks to others, verify transactions (reducing double spend), and transmitting those transactions to other full nodes and to the miners.
Without miners or full nodes, there is no bitcoin. With few miners or few full nodes, there is concern for centralized control and seizure of funds in bitcoin (central control of miners could reject transactions from addresses and central control of full nodes could reject mined blocks with those addresses and/or not relay transactions to miners with those addresses).
Full nodes are the gateways to the entire network. SPV wallets have to get their transactions to a full node in order to get them transmitted to the network.

I don't think boycotting would be useful. Reaching out to whoever is assigned this patent at the patent office and showing them the prior art (perhaps the bitcoin core github repository and other information) would be the best thing to do.
Plenty of patents get awarded that shouldn't, simply because those reviewing them don't have the expertise or resources to properly vet them. Reach out, or reach out to BitGo for an explanation on what they are looking to actually patent and how it is something novel and useful they are bringing and not something already in existence in the bitcoin world.
On a quick glance it looks to me that they are talking about the "pay to script hash", which is much more general than just multisig, but they are focusing on the multisig use of that.
**EDIT: Actually on another glance it looks like they may be doing something more specific with keys because it uses the OP_PUSH_DATA and also talks about encrypting keys with other keys. This sounds more specific, and might even be a novel thing. I suggest contacting BitGo, to get past the "patent-ese", and find out what they are going after before reddit freaks out**
**SECOND EDIT: IANAL but upon more detailed reading the patent is definitely not for P2SH or multisig. It has to do with distributing, generating, and storing keys and transferring them between web devices securely.**

You really need a Rpi 2, even with pruning you still need more RAM than a B+, and it would take a while to actually verify the blocks. I'm always for getting empirical, so you should try it if you have the time, but you'd probably need to do some modifications such as using zRam or something.

Only two of the attendees wear glasses. I guess Branson must have a bias against those who suffer from bad vision too. /sarcasm
The author seemed to focus on the "kiteboarding" aspect of the MaiTai description and not so much the "entrepreneurs and venture capitalists" part.
She also did not post a link, or call it by it's full name, "MaiTai Global". She also failed to mention another attendee, Bill Tai, is also a co-founder of this MaiTai Global. And [the website]( says prominently that "MaiTai Global is a group of extraordinary entrepreneurs, innovators and athletes".
She also failed to mention (or notice) that the logo for MaiTai Global is the logo at the top of the Blockchain Summit site, and the site layout is essentially the same. Hmm... could, I dunno, MaiTai Global be the ones running the event? Gee, perhaps having two of their founders present doesn't seem so odd now, does it?
I think the author is doing what she can to skew reality to fit her preconceived point.
Or there's a conspiracy amongst the men in bitcoin to keep women out. I'm sure that's equally likely.

Looks like a spokesperson for Branson contacted the author and she has updated her story (and updated the very misleading title):
*Update: Richard Branson spokesperson Nick Fox got back to us by email Tuesday evening. “This is not our event,” he says. “It is being organised by an investment company who have hired Necker Island and have selected the people. Richard has been invited and has had no role in the selection of the guests or curation of the event.”*
It literally just took reading Mai's description on the blockchain summit page and looking at the MaiTai Global website to figure this out. How an author who claims to [have hacked a smart home and given a surprise visit to a datacenter]( failed to put these obvious clues together is beyond me.
She is still referring to Mai in the article as only a professional kiteboarder, leaving out the whole co-founder and President of MaiTai Global.

I'm surprised that is all they said... the 2GB requirement assumes normal OS consumption, and Linux can be stripped down pretty lean. I assumed that was what bitseed did, although they are running Ubuntu on their board so unless they trimmed it, they could hit some bumps. Raspbian (Debian Wheezy) is already very streamlined and so a full node runs well on 1GB on a Raspberry Pi 2. On the Rpi 2, the full node consumes between 60-70% RAM on average, so if they haven't trimmed Ubuntu, they could be hitting swap.

Using purse.io and gyft are great services for me, the consumer, but they don't help merchant adoption, which is what I'm trying to push.

There is a mix up of concepts here... addresses are still exactly as random as you thought. Their distribution just isn't uniform. These are two very different things.

Bitcoin full nodes are needed. They are the ones who keep a full copy of the blockchain, verify transactions, and transmit transactions to the network for miners to include in blocks. Without full nodes, there is no network. And if there are only a few, then whoever owns those nodes can choose what transactions will be broadcast to the network and what blocks to pass on (if a majority of full nodes decided not to pass on or include a block with certain transactions then you'd have effective seizure of funds).
They kinda help put the "decentral" in decentralized.
@_date: 2015-04-27 03:42:00
If I understand your question, I think you are asking if there is an increase in the number of full nodes in the world with the number of transactions held constant, will your full node be uploading more data to the network?
If so, the answer depends more on the behavior of nodes out there than the count.
Bitcoind has a parameter for max number of connections. I think the default is 100. So if you happen to be connected to 100 nodes, and those nodes stay up, then no matter how many other nodes join the network your uploads will be constant.
However, if nodes keep coming on and offline, then you may end up connecting to hundreds of nodes even though you will only connect to 100 at a time, and so your uploads could be significantly higher.
If you want to reduce your uploads, you can run bitcoind with -maxconnections=40 or some other number that makes sense to you, and it should reduce uploads on average, although not a guarantee because of the above mentioned behavior.
You could also rateshape your uploading bandwidth from either your router or in Ubuntu if you feel comfortable doing some networking (and your router has that functionality, although most home routers do not).
I poked around and [this is a short tutorial that could get you going with Ubuntu rateshaping](

The reason setting up an email account is so easy today (versus 20 years ago) is because companies built services on top of the email protocols adding value and allowing email to be used by more people. These people didn't eventually learn how to setup their own email servers, there just wasn't a need for it. If services that bring value aren't built on top of bitcoin then bitcoin won't really go very far. For those who want "complete control" they can always send their bitcoin to an address they generate themselves. Most will want to take advantage of the ecosystem that is being built on top of bitcoin.
There's nothing wrong with having 'bitcoin banks'. Bitcoin gives you the choice to be your own bank, but no one says you have to. That choice is one of many things that makes bitcoin better than other currencies.

Ah, clearly I failed to get to that FAQ. I just used Newegg's feedback to mention this. I greatly appreciate this response (for what it's worth).

Bitcoin core 0.10 runs just fine on my rpi2, even right out of the box with Raspbian. However, there are some optimizations that can be made. You can run it headless and allocate more RAM to the CPU. If memory actually starts to become an issue, you can build Debain-Wheezy with the zRam module and allocate a chunk of memory as a compressed block swap. You can also run it without wallet functionality and skip the Berkeley DB requirements, and so on... It really doesn't need all this, but it's there if it did.

We get that people use dogecoin for 'the atmosphere and attitude', cause that's what they keep saying. What we don't fully understand is why some people (mostly dogecoiners) think that bitcoin isn't fun, doesn't have a good atmosphere and doesn't have a good attitude.
My experience with other bitcoiners is that most are fun and great people who want the world to be a better place.
As for me, I have a blast programming bitcoin and experimenting on testnet. After over a year it is still fun for me to spend bitcoins in different ways (either building my own transactions by scripting it myself or going the other extreme and sending with coinbase). Many open source orgs and great charities accept bitcoin, and I have a blast donating and knowing I am helping the world (however tiny my contributions may be, I just wish Kiva would let me use bitcoin, I'd love to see a bitcoin microfinance service, that would merge two great ideas for some serious benefit, hell I'd be a part of a startup team that wants to build that).
Part of bitcoin is 'serious' but it damn better be. It is that seriousness that lets the rest of us be lighthearted, goofy, fun loving helpful people.
Our experience with bitcoin is exactly that great atmosphere and attitude that dogecoiners claim to love, just 'backed' by enough seriousness and diligence to allow it to actually thrive and grow.

Rather than make the claim that a Raspberry Pi 2 "doesn't have the computing power to run a full node", people should get empirical. I've been running a bitcoin full node (bitcoin core 0.10) on a Raspberry Pi 2 for over a week. I've seen it have over 70 connections and it works just fine. CPU sits mostly around 10% but jumps to about 30% when verifying a block, and bitcoind consumes less than 70% of RAM leaving more than enough for Raspbian. Bitcoind doesn't really require much computing other than verifying, so the idea that a quad-core can't keep up just shows people don't really understand hardware or what a bitcoin full node actually does. Storage and bandwidth is the main concern, and a 64 or 128GB USB drive works just fine.

I took a look, and I did have one thing in my cart that wasn't "sold by" Newegg. Thanks for pointing that out. I have purchased a lot from Newegg and I have never run into this issue. I wish there was some explanation somewhere. If there had been, I could have purchased the bulk of my items from Newegg with bitcoin and found the one item elsewhere, but since they didn't communicate that anywhere, they lost out.
A "your purchase doesn't qualify for payment with bitcoin because..." statement would have been nice during the billing phase where the bitcoin payment method is usually presented.
So user error on my part combined with poor communication from Newegg.

A bunch of people flock to use an altcoin because it is "fun and goofy" and not "serious" like bitcoin, but then all of a sudden get very serious when they lose large amounts of it. Money and financial assets are worth taking seriously. If dogecoin really was for fun then no one would care about losing it.

That's true, and the tx fee could have been what the author was alluding to, but it doesn't seem to be the case. Is waiting hours for confirmation ok if someone just wants to 'play around'? Not sure, but waiting that long would seem to be a hindrance. Definitely a fair point. But for a couple dollars one can play around with bitcoin and pay tx fees, although that is different than pennies.
I'd argue that the vastly greater use and infrastructure around bitcoin makes it easier to get and play with than most alts, including dogecoin. Coinbase takes seconds to get an account and get some bitcoin (assuming you are banked), and services like changetip allow people to play with bitcoin very easily. I'm straying from what the author and this thread was discussing, but I can't see dogecoin being any 'easier' than bitcoin to get into, which was the core of the author's claim.

One way to help orient what this could mean is to think about what specific activities would look like based on plotting the data this way. For example, if one or a cluster of addresses that were created at a specific time sent somewhat regular (say once a day) amounts to new addresses being created just as regularly, you get a vertical line. One thing that would do that would be a published address like a donation address or static receiving address which is programmed to regularly send amounts to newly generated addresses.
If new addresses being created regularly (again, say once a day) were regularly sending bitcoin to the same address over time, you would get a horizontal line. This makes sense as the other side of the vertical line explanation above (there is a reason there is symmetry reflected across the diagonal).
If people only sent and received with new addresses, you get the diagonal (what OP pointed out is a lot of change addresses).
Dots in the top left corner would mean an address that showed up on the blockchain early on sent something to an address created more recently. Dots in the bottom right would mean an address created more recently sent something to an address that had been created early on.
As people then spend from their change addresses, they would be sending mostly to older addresses, so  you'd get a slight 'fanning out' to the right of the diagonal (which we can see here) which ought to expand more (due to more addresses overall being created) as we follow the diagonal (going forward in time, although not necessarily smoothly) which we also see.
The trend of being brighter as we go down from the diagonal, which isn't smooth but exists, could be just newer addresses sending to older ones, perhaps addresses for stores or donations (which I mentioned earlier).
So the slanted lines, what could they mean? Since diagonal means new addresses sending to new addresses (or just new receiving a lot) and horizontal would mean new addresses sending to an old (static) one, then a slight positive slope generally would mean addresses sending are being generated at a rate significantly higher than addresses receiving are being generated. One thing that could cause this would be the 'provably fair' gambling sites that rotate their receiving addresses over time but get a lot of new addresses sending to them. This possible explanation has been mentioned by a few others but I felt they didn't do a good job communicating why and I thought a more (long winded) analysis could help.
A correction for the rate of addresses creation on the blockchain over time, and labeled, would be more intuitive for people and could show some interesting things.

Actually, with 0.10 not doubling up the verifications, by your calculations we've got 50-100x headroom. Most benchmarks put the rpi2 at around 6-7x, so probably more in the realm of 60-140x (I'm assuming you were at least using 0.8 when you ran yours). And this is if we ignore what others pointed out, which is that the tx verification isn't that bad and the block header verification is constant. We'll easily run into storage or other issues before the CPU becomes a problem.
And scaling isn't just about more transactions. We'll need to see something like payment channels to truly scale bitcoin where we need it to be, and so eventually transaction numbers may become more or less constant.
If a tiny Raspberry Pi 2 with a USB stick can run as a full node for a couple years, that's pretty awesome and totally worth it.
