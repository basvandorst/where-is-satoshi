Check all your emails if you keep them or deleted emails from those dates if you can in case that gives you a clue.

Dude. Do some research before buying and selling something like bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:39:10
There are loads of us in bitcoin and who have been around for years. It is the sexist attitudes like you display in your title that stop us being more vocal in the community. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:16:50
WTF. I don't think you know many women IRL. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:41:52
Why would people invest $500 or $2500 with a random company and pay fees and expenses when they could just put $500 of bitcoin in a wallet themselves? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:20:47
I’m not a fanatic or hodler. I’ve got a bit of btc because I needed it a few years ago then forgot my wallet password until last week. As a user not a btc endorser, it kind of sucks. I’ve transferred my coins in two transactions and it cost a bomb on one and the other took 3 days :/ You can’t use them to purchase anything due to volatility and transaction time. I’m not sure what good they are as a currency. I mean I’m super glad they shot up in value as I got a surprise windfall. But I’m stunned at how hard they are to actually use. I thought at this price you could at least transfer then to a different wallet without waiting days.

I used a couple of the accelerator services on the Bitcointalk forum and my stuck transaction was confirmed afterwards. Try that? So frustrating isn’t it. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:05:43
It is never wise to invest everything in something ridiculously speculative :/ 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:22:44
That’s completely different. Traditionally women are the ones who end up sacrificing their careers for a family unit. There are a huge range of socio economic reasons women look at income when selecting a partner. Family income = security. 
Men rank looks in the top three attributes but I don’t think all men are shallow. 
Women ‘liking expensive things’ is sexist and plain stupid. Just as many men like expensive things as women.

If you make investment decisions based on this sub then you’re in for a bad time. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:10:55
It is no use. None of the accelerators even are working anymore. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:29:04
Unsure on that sorry. I know that adding them to the next block through antpool or via btc isn’t working anymore. I have tried to help a guy here with 1.1btc stuck for 16 days. 
Maybe google CPFP and see if that might work. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:38:05
Maybe you transferred to the dark web and bought something?
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:56:01
This sub will tell you to hodl. Personally, I sold 2/3 of my btc. It isn’t an emotional thing for me it is a logical one. There are too many issues with btc for me to think it is going to stay above 20k for a huge amount if time. The rest I am prepared to lose or hold for the moon. 
There is no way I would sit on 21 btc at 20k. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:19:32
The darknet users are screaming for Monero implementation. I’ve been pulling fr9m btc and putting into monero this week. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:23:52
My last transaction took 4 days. It’s ridiculous 
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:20:00
Hey at least you’re going to end up with more than you expected! 
Ok I posted here: 
Tried all the free tools here: 
But I would post in all the accelerator threads here if I was you: 
Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:29:01
But if there is something better available today then why would people wait for Bitcoin? I have no horse in this race as I sold at 19K. But I just find it hard to think Bitcoin will win against coins that work better. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:23:50
What’s with all the beggars lately? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:27:01
It isn't the case anymore. It is too slow and expensive atm to do much besides hold it for future profit. Or buy drugs.
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:43:17
Have they tried an accelerator service? Mine was stuck for 3 days until I accelerated it. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:05:46
I wonder if you’re paying a super high fee? I paid $6.57 usd for my transaction and ended up using accelerator services to get it to go through. The threads of stuck transactions are full on Bitcointalk. 
I too really hope lightning changes things. I’ve really struggled to explain to people the benefit of such a slow, clunky currency. If you don’t want to invest as an investment or buy stuff on the dark net then there’s little to use it for currently. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:57:30
OK so think of a price each way you will pull it out and stick to it. I ignore everything in this sub about hodling etc. I said I would sell 2/3 at 19.5K and I did. even though it looked for sure to go over that. I said Ill pull out at 17K and I did. You can't go all in on something so highly speculative as BTC without making rules and sticking to them. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:33:55
I bought at $300 and sold at 19500 and 17k. 
I was locked out of my wallet for four years after forgetting my password and forgot about it until I saw btc was almost 20k. I sat for an entire morning typing in various passwords until I managed to remember it. 
Good times.

Bitcoin is now super easy to buy and sell in Australia. Four years ago it was a bit of an effort but now there are local bitcoin ATM’s even. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:39:18
I've sent it to an accelerator for you. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:01:42
1. No one knows. 
2. 
3. Everyone has their own opinion. You need to research.

Drugs were how I heard about it years ago.

As a woman who has been in and out of bitcoin since 2014, comments like the ones here are the exact reason we don't participate much in the community or bother being more visible. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 03:54:40
Haha no
@_date: 2017-07-02 12:34:12
He's a fantasist. Read his posts about winning million dollar bets and buying yachts etc. all well researched but all extensive fantasy. It's interesting but it's all just made up.
