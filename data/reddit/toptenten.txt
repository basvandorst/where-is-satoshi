You can send from a '1' address to a 'bc1' address using Electrum.

You mean your PIN and your (optional) passphrase?
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:47:05
What I mean is you could derive the private keys and import them into another wallet
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:27:29
I don't think you understand this.
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:19:15
You could generate your your private keys externally to the bread app if you have your bread recovery passphrase.

"Money is gold"... are you from the 1960s?

Blockchain is an online wallet. It's OK for dabbling with small amounts.
@_date: 2017-11-06 11:11:52
3.8 megs would be a spam block.

Not necessarily a hard fork. Graphene could be opt-in for the miner and blocks with not using it could just fall back to traditional propagation method and still be considered valid. Since this is a network upgrade and not a change to the blockchain itself.
@_date: 2017-11-06 11:20:25
Very little, hence the popularity of SPV wallets.

I think you misunderstood. This is a list of common anti-LN arguments to look out for.

The light and sound is absorbed in the room's surroundings as heat.
Only the photons from the LEDs which go out of the windows are lost.

What exactly in your mind told you it will go back to 5.5?
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:33:54
Same for me. macOS

Starting with a 3 would be a P2WPKH-in-P2SH address, which is more of a shim for backwards compatibility. Electrum 3.0 uses native Segwit addresses that start with "bc1" i.e. BIP173 addresses.

Since they are all likely spun up by the same person or just a few people, it is deceptively making it appear that there is more community support than there really is.

I think the fact that Bitcoin Cash is being promoted by the website "bitcoin.com" is a little on the fraudulent side.
But you are or course right that bash itself is not fraudulent.
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:14:17
Good question.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:21:45
Yeah there will be lots of pitfalls for the unwary :(
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:23:37
What logic is that? The objective is to ban 2x nodes.

I do support decentralisation. Bitcoin system itself is king. It's all a game. Individuals like you and me are just players in the game. Core devs are just players. NYA signers are just players. Miners are just players. What happens will happen. 
Maybe 2x will succeed, maybe it won't. I have an opinion, you have an opinion ... but our opinions do no matter.
What matters is ACTIONS. Actions taken by all the players in the game. Some players are loud and make a lot of noise, and some are quiet and let their actions talk.
I agree with you - all this debating and shouting is just noise.

You can split your coins manually.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:25:25
There are a few ways to do it, but here is one way to split your coins, using Electrum: 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:23:44
If it's your own address then it's accessible to you on both chains. The private key will be the same.
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:16:47
Won't this ban any Core nodes genuinely running on AWS too?
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:18:41
Agreed, DCA is suboptimal during a rising market period. But it is less risky ands that is the reason people do it.
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:14:13
Should be self-evident.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:15:28
Yes all actions.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:42:06
Then the receiver gets the coins on both chains.
Best to split your coins if you are worried.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:39:48
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:09:21
But if it does drop then you win out. It's a gamble either way.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:13:18
OK I'll try again.
Great lets all hand our data over to Amazon.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:17:38
Maybe but we don't have Schnorr signatures yet do we.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:23:10
This is why you should split your coins first, so they can only be spent on one chain.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:38:33
That's bloody clever. So you could essentially leak out the private key slowly over the course of many transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:26:40
I like your mixed metaphor.
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:24:53
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:32:47
Anyone know how to derive a ypub/Ypub/zpub/Zpub key from a BIP39 mnemonic?
Something like  maybe.
@_date: 2017-11-06 11:18:33


Great let's all put out data in one place.
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:14:00
^ People: read these two comments and DON'T DO THIS ^ :)
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:13:49
Why do you have 4 nodes?
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:36:18
Fair play.
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:27:08
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:30:10
If the transaction is mined on both chains then you'll still have the coins in the new address on both chains.
EDIT: Why the fuck would this be down voted? It is a simple statement of fact. How is it even controversial? I don't normally bitch about down votes, but come on....
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:22:02
I tried to buy you reddit gold but I fucked up the transaction because I used RBF to increase the initial fee and coinbase barfed on it. Reddit has my money on your behalf :)

The trouble with it would have also cost you $8 to transfer $8 worth of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:34:52
It is vary rational. I didn't trust the built in RNG on my Ledger Nano S so I generated my own seed and input it manually.
This is what I did - I generated the seed using dice rolls and  (on on offline computer, naturally)

I don't oppose block size increase. I oppose this particular hard fork attempt.

Why did you invest in ARK?

Even with fans it's 100% heat. All the vibration, air movement and sound is converted to heat ultimately.
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:43:13
Excellent question
@_date: 2017-11-06 11:30:20
Nobody here cares about your trades. You are just speculating with this buy/sell stuff.
But r/bitcoinmarkets will like this kind of question.
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:04:59
DCA is inferior in a rising market but superior in a falling market.
Lump sum maximises both your gains and losses.
It's is as much a psychological tool as anything else.
@_date: 2017-11-06 09:24:45
Can't you just solve this by specifically grouping CPFP transactions and putting them in a valid order? Just needs an agreed CPFP-aware  ordering.
EDIT: I see you said that in your edit :)
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:37:36
Fair enough. Either way the point was to ban 2x nodes, not aws nodes.
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:41:46
That sounds about right.
@_date: 2017-11-06 11:29:51
Yes
