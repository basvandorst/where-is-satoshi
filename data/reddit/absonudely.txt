Just because the word "registered" is used a lot doesnt mean he supports a national registry.  Many firearms are already required to be registered in accordance to the National Firearms act of 1934 that was mentioned.  It specifically says he does not want to change those requirements.  Regarding the fingerprints and dna, that is only for automatic and advanced weapons.  Are all your guns assault rifles?  If not, a basic safety course and a gun safe / trigger lock RECEIPT is all thats required.  It is illegal to lie to a police officer, incite violence, or commit fraud without stepping on our 1a rights.  It should also be ok to put some restrictions on advance firearms without taking them away and violating 2a rights.  Also, Trump already banned bump stocks.

Andrew yang [tweeted]( about bitcoin in 2013! He is pro blockchain tech and his campaign accepts bitcoin donations.
@_date: 2019-07-19 14:14:15
Yang is one of the most pro 2a dem candidates.  He wants to focus on the mental health issues that lead to mass shootings instead to taking away guns.  He is also pro gun safety and licensing.

Pleaae explain how my example on the 1a is invalid.  You are using the slippery slope fallacy that any gun control measure will lead to the total abolishment of gun ownership.

We have a trillion dollar deficit this year for the first time since the great depression

It would help the 78% of Americans living paycheck to paycheck and the 63% that couldnt afford a sudden $500 expense.  The economic growth from these people suddenlu having unconditional cash would be astounding.

My bad, the stat was was supposed to exclude the great recession as well.

Yea but not this week

Very interesting, thanks for sharing!  I've felt that offline transactions is maybe the largest limitation of bitcoin and advantages of cash.  A solution to this problem can only help the movement towards mass adoption.

Call me crazy but a gigantic, multibillion dollar corporation such as Amazon that is sucking up billions of dollars from the economy by eliminating malls and local stores should have to pay federal taxes.
@_date: 2019-08-28 17:00:57
He is not a politician.  He is an entrepreneur that started a nonprofit to create jobs and businesses and realized that he couldnt create jobs faster than automation was taking away jobs.  And he tweeted about bitcoin back in 2013.

A 10% VAT is a pretty low tax rate compared to the rest of the world.  Making the big tech companies pay more than zero will not destroy the economy.  And giving everyone $1k to spend as they chose would grow the economy substantially.
@_date: 2019-08-28 17:14:24
 &gt;the 10% VAT targets everyone on his proposal and allows for larger businesses and cartels to more easily avoid paying than small businesses via tax loopholes and carousal fraud.
How do you figure?  The VAT is the best tool to actually tax the multibillion dollar tech companies who can just move their IP around to various tax havens.  It can also be structured progressively to tax the larger corporations more than small businesses.

Unless there's a VAT tax implemented.  Do you think its a good thing that 60 Fortune 500 companies paid zero in federal taxes?

I don't hodl it, i automatically give it to content creators i regularly view.  Its actually a pretty awesome business model.

No new money would needed to be printed for this proposal.
@_date: 2019-08-28 17:11:19
Is that what I said?  Once again, there is zero justification for Amazon to pay less in federal taxes than the average American.

Same!  That being said, you'll get way more bang for your buck with limit orders and super low fees on cb pro

I personally feel safer owning bitcoin in my trezor.  Its unlikely, but it would suck so much ass if robinhood got shut down or something.  Also i believe you have to market buy with rh which charges a small fee

Hate speech and calls to violence are against nearly every social media terms of agreement.  If you break those rules, you should be banned.
@_date: 2019-01-11 16:47:39
Yea just look at some the verified tweets from gab for proof
@_date: 2018-11-29 15:55:05
what's the first?
@_date: 2019-01-14 16:53:34
With other currencies, the supply is directly correlated to the demand as governments, gold miners, etc. are economically incentivized to inflate the supply.  This explains the volatility of bitcoins value as the wild demand fluctuations have had no impact on the supply
@_date: 2019-01-16 19:25:05
The cost of making it is what makes it valuable.  Gold would be worthless if it was easy to mine
@_date: 2019-01-28 04:28:47
Ive found that coinbase pro is excellent.  No fees on limit orders is clutch

Bitcoin is up 103,450% in the last 7 years


It's not like my bank account is a pile of money that they occasionally throw some pennies on top of for interest.  Things can be both digital and real.

I'd rather bitcoin not be associated with Nazis.  There's a huge difference between buying drugs and shooting up a synagogue (the Pittsburgh shooter was a verified gab user.)
@_date: 2018-12-14 03:37:55
why sell at 1.4x the price?  seems shortsighted
@_date: 2018-12-26 14:09:02
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:14:13
I'm glad you agree that nazism = vile speech.
Look, the point I'm making here is very simple.  Gab is a social media site that is rightfully associated with some of worst of humanity.  I'd prefer that bitcoin not be associated with gab for that reason.
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:38:20


No, but society needs to do it's best to stop them from getting back into power.  Social media is much more powerful than flyers and meetings.






Ok any speech that literally advocates for violence is wrong.  All I'm saying is racism and bigotry is wrong and somehow that statement is viewed as controversial 
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:15:07
You know its 2018 when you get downvoted for condemning Nazis.
My post was relevant to the topic and was therefore not whataboutism.  I asserted that there is a lot of of hateful, anti-semetic rhetoric that is welcomed by gab.  I pointed out the shooter because that is a tragic example of the unfortunate consequences when conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic views are encouraged by other users.  Of course Facebook and Twitter have issues but gab is the worst offender and promoter of some of the most vile speech that should not have a platform.  It is sad to see so many nazi defenders in this thread.
@_date: 2018-12-11 19:10:58
This reads like a Trump tweet lol
@_date: 2018-12-19 17:28:50
Correct.  Assuming equal demand, a lower supply will result in an increase in price.  This increase in price leads to an increase in demand due to FOMO, which results in a price bubble.
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:26:08




No shit.  All the more reason to take this issue seriously rather than ignore it.  Although I do not plan to boycott fast food, cars, or electricity because nazis use them because they cannot grow a following, indoctrinate people, and encourage violence by buying fast food.




Any opinion that does not support violence against a group of people based upon the race or religion is fine by me :)
@_date: 2018-12-18 19:54:14
I do not want the government regulating speech.  I am fine with Twitter enforcing their user agreement rules because, while nazis and racist constantly get mocked on twitter, they turn conversations into cesspools and make the experience worse for everyone involved.  That is not authoritarian.  That is the free market acting in its best interest.
Go fuck yourself you nazi sympathizer 
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:18:53
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:41:32
Honest question, so what happens after 2140? Doesnt an increase in supply help grow the economy?
@_date: 2018-12-29 12:52:20
Great points.  Explains why bitcoin's value has dropped so much from 7 years ago /s
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:31:10
When did I say Gab = nazis?  The assertion was that nazis use gab which you seem to agree with.  Frankly, I'm uncomfortable with anyone giving nazi ideology a platform.

True.  But governments can't be tempted to print extra money to pay off their loans
@_date: 2018-12-21 16:49:38
In my mind, the value needs to be just as stable as fiat to be worth the complete switch over to crypto. Because supply is limited and predictable, that should theoretically happen, but not anytime in the near future.  Also, think how stable a truly global currency would be.  The global economy is much more stable than any one singular country's
@_date: 2018-12-18 15:36:36
Holy whataboutism.  The Pittsburgh shooter committed the worst anti-Semitic act in American history.  Sadly, neo-nazism is gaining traction and gab provides a safe platform for them.  FUCK NAZIS
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:45:29
Good write up.  Following this long term thinking, is there a good strategy for trading with leverage or should I stick with limit orders?
@_date: 2018-12-27 15:59:03
hold for 5+ years and those bear market crashes are still well above your entry price point and way above the value of that money left alone in a savings account as it is slowly bled dry by inflation 
@_date: 2018-12-28 18:19:52
No, I've never participated in a big bull run.  Similar to OP, I had some leftover bitcoin from buying fake id's.  Now that I have an income, I've bought a lot more coin and am trying to develop a strategy for the next ATH (I think it will probably be mid 2020)
@_date: 2018-12-18 16:41:59
Again, I never said gab promotes nazis (although that argument certainly could be made based upon some of their tweets.) Blocking people is not enough when they can gather a following.  Ignoring nazis is basically enabling them.
Also, bitcoin is a mostly anonymous currency, not a social media platform, so it's your logic that's bullshit
@_date: 2018-12-15 23:11:03
But you can sell at Dec 2019 prices

Thank you.  I needed to hear that after reading this thread.  While I agree that I shouldnt judge the technology by association, I'm worried that newcomers might.
