Tax returns report profits (gains or losses) on the accounts; if there is no gain or loss, then there is no need to report anything to the IRS, right?  I thought that was the actual issue - whether the IRS should be notified simply because you buy something, not profit from it.

Normally, with mutual funds or stock, your broker provides a form (1099?) at the end of the year with all the tax information, and you simply enter this on your tax return.  I assume they also provide this to the IRS, but I'm not sure.
But an institution like Coinbase doesn't seem to provide this information.  So how is someone to even know how much to pay?  If I invested $50 a few times over the course of 2 or 3 years, and it's now worth, say $500, and I take out half that, how do I even know how much to pay?

Right now, I think it's more of a commodity, closer to gold.  Gold was used as a currency for many, many years, but not so much any more.  Who knows what Bitcoin will be in the future, but right now, it's not a very good currency because it's not readily acceptable, which is one of the requirements for currency, I believe.  It has nothing to do with not wanting to spend it so much as not being able to.  I only got in to it a few years ago because I wanted to donate to a website that preferred it.  I left a little in a Coinbase account, and next time, it had gone up enough so I didn't even need to add to it.  That was when I started adding more, even though it was a ridiculous $500/coin.  :-)

You're assuming I have all my money in Bitcoin?  No way.  I would never invest more than I can afford to lose in something I can't really measure.  The only reason I ever even got started was because I needed some Bitcoin to donate a few years back, and I left some in for later, where it went up a lot, so I invested a bit more over the years.  I liked the idea, and wanted to support it.  But if I lived in one of the high-inflation countries with no alternatives, I'd probably invest more - why not?
Anyway, I've already sold enough to cover my initial investments, so what I have invested now is just profit.   I buy small amounts when it goes down, like a few hundred at 12,000 recently using a limit order that I didn't even think would trigger

So, doesn't that make all stock market buys gambling?  You look at a company's sales, capital, mix that with a belief that the market is good for their product, and a belief that their management will continue to make good decisions, etc.
There's no way to know for sure that a company will succeed and make money.  If there was, everyone would be making money lots of companies would not even have gotten started.

Considering how few places there are you can "spend' bitcoin, it's not much of a currency.  However, considering the inflation rate of some non-US countries, it makes a much better way to hold onto your money than the banks.
So, to me, it seems like your entire purpose might not be the only entire purpose.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:38:50
To be honest, I don't really want you to explain (your concept of) the difference between gambling and investing, although I'm sure you think you know more than everyone else.  But thanks for your presumptuous offer.  
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:29:00
What if the fund doesn't pay dividends, and you don't touch it.  Would the IRS know that you simply bought the fund?  If I open a $100 savings account, does the IRS immediately get informed?  I wouldn't think so on either case, but I don't know for sure.

I gamble every time I make a post on Reddit, where I believe I'm saying something useful or intelligent, but often leave smoking craters instead. ;-)

How did you get gilded for that?
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:02:37
Thanks, people should learn the basics from the stock market literature.  If you're going to invest in something, and think it's worthwhile, then think long term.  Last time I bought bitcoin (at $4400), I hesitated because it was twice as much as the previous buy 3 months earlier.  Now, both those buys seem pretty good, but I didn't know it at the time.  I only wish I'd bought more than $100 worth. :-)
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:36:01
No, just saying it could be.  Mostly I'm saying that it's too soon to know whether it was a good buy or not, or, more that watching the daily or hourly performance is not such a good idea.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:56:09
Ever hear of a dead cat bounce?  Following a market hour to hour, or day to day, will make you crazy.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:24:34
From much of what I read here, I'd agree.  I'd say 50% of the people here know very little about investing at all.
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:56:59
Actually, nothing until I sell it.  But it's up 50% as of now, from October.  If I subtract what I've paid out to a various sites, I've invested $200 total, and it's been above and below $1000 today.  Not too bad.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:29:40
Damn you, I'm down over $100 from yesterday!
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:16:38
Wow.  I first started buying when it was around $500, but didn't really know enough to buy much until it went well over that.  I was buying about 0.1 btc at a time.
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:23:40
It's a stock market term.  It's when a bad stock goes way down, then starts rising a bit before falling more.  I believe it refers to "even a dead cat will bounce if it falls hard enough", but that doesn't mean it's going to keep going.
More generally, it just means a temporary rise before it continues to go down.  
But good policy is to buy what you have confidence in, and hope it goes down so you can buy more.  At least, that's the Warren Buffet method.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:33:25
Always a good idea to buy low.  With regular stocks, it's a good idea to keep some cash available for these times when it becomes a good buy.  I'm learning about that from my son, who is a stock analyst.
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:36:57
Same here.  I learned the hard way about investing, after losing a significant amount during the old dot com crash.
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:58:08
I use Coinbase, but never had any problems so far.  I probably shouldn't have said that.
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:29:27
Warren Buffet obviously knows a lot about investing and making money, but he's been wrong before, although not as often as he's been right. He's not a speculator at all.  He mainly looks at concrete valuations, and if he can't see how it's valued, then he will avoid it, as he did in the dot com days.  He was mostly correct then, but people said he was too conservative and too old to understand the potential.  
I don't believe in following anyone's advice absolutely, but I would not dismiss what he says about anything as rubbish.  Saying he's too old to understand is just ageism, and a mistake, IMO, even if bitcoin eventually becomes a solid success.
@_date: 2017-09-07 22:34:30
I don't understand.
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:42:14
That doesn't seem like a real good analogy, although for diamonds, it's closer.  But diamonds do have value due to their cutting ability as a tool, and the fact that they are much shinier and prettier than a bitcoin. :-)
Gold, of course, has many uses in electronics, looks nice and is malleable so easy to make nice things out of it.  Also, it's not really that plentiful and can't be fabricated like diamonds.
To me, bitcoin is mainly speculation that it will become important, which I hope for.  But if it doesn't become useful, and since it can't be looked at or displayed, I find it hard to believe that its rarity alone will make it valuable. It's just a bunch of bits in the clouds, isn't it?
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:18:19
I'm not actually putting him down completely, but I'm sorta taking issue with his quote; I think this particular quote sounds like something coming from an old fart.  He's saying, and maybe I'm taking him too literally, that he has not thought about it at all yet he hates it.  
I can see where he might say he wouldn't invest in it.  Buffet refused to invest in tech stocks before the big crash because he didn't understand the valuation, and how people could invest so much in companies simply on the hopes that they might succeed in the future.  That makes sense.  But he didn't hate the companies, he just didn't feel he wanted to invest.  
BTW, I wouldn't say they understand human psychology so much as they simply understand investing, which includes things like brand loyalty, market share, etc.  This is more about knowing investment habits from past experience, but not so much why people do these things.
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:02:31
Thanks, but I meant I don't understand the US economy.  But I'm obviously not an average redditor, since I didn't insult him or anything. ;-)
PS  I definitely don't understand bitcoin - the part about how it can be valuable even though there's not much you can buy with it.  But still, I've been buying them for about 3 years (some buys were $500/bitcoin or less - too bad I didn't buy more then).
@_date: 2018-02-15 02:42:04
He said "“I never considered for one second having anything to do with [bitcoin]. I detested it the minute it had been raised. The more popular it got, the more I hated it. . . . Bitcoin is noxious poison.”
So, that sounds like he knows nothing about it, yet he knows he doesn't like it.  Sounds like the type of thinking you'd expect from a 94 year old fart.  I suspect he doesn't understand what it is, so the more popular it gets, the more frustrated he becomes.

Same here.  It's not worth the wear and tear on my pockets.  Also, it makes some people happy to find one - pennies from heaven.

Or, as some might say, "That's hapiness."

Certain accents make it more obvious.  There's a story about some famous actress from eastern Europe who, when asked what she most wanted, said something like "I just want 'appiness", with the accent on the 2nd syllable.

Apparently, there are special brokerages or programs that do that, but it can be problematic, like selling sometimes, or transferring to another broker.  I'm guessing that you are not the legal owner of the stock - certainly not for any partial shares.  So, you can't really sell them except within the company that sold them to you - they would be the actual owners, right?
@_date: 2017-06-21 03:40:14
Are  you sure?  I know dividend re-investment is common for mutual funds, but I've never seen that option for stocks.
@_date: 2017-06-21 03:37:07
I guess simply doubling in price in less than a year is not worth bothering with for some people?
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:05:18
Guess I've never used a broker like that.  None of the ones I've used offer that, although after a quick search, I see that it's sometimes done, though it can be problematic in some cases.
@_date: 2017-06-21 03:39:02
A fraction of one share?  I don't think I've ever heard of that.  Mutual funds, yes, but stocks?  I don't think you can officially do that.  One share has one owner, I believe.

I thought it was all about buying low and selling high.  :)
