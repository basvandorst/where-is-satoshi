FWI the bartender in the card room just called me to tell me the guys in the card room had many drinks tonight, he overheard my name and that the guys were talking about pressing the bitcoin kill button to destroy it quickly. They were too concerned about legality to do it now but maybe later by someone with a 'quieter profile'

Thanks for your reply. What if price dropped to $100 and most of the miners strike because they would loose less by shutting down? Wouldn't that kill bitcoin?

Maybe the guys in the card room are smarter and more devious than I think

You sound like my ex who said I speak with my t--t not my mind :)

I'm not buying because **it's the devil you know is better than the devil you don't**

Just letting everyone know that security-camera video with audio shows guys in the Card Room of the Club starting and ending recent bitcoin crash. Private link and password available. This is follow up to my previous post about this (
Edit: Had to let the security man do the yucky thing to get it - duty called :)

Good question. Maybe he makes the new NY rules really bad for bitcoin and other states and countries follow.

Best answer yet. Thx.

The only thing I still can't understand is if bitcoin price gets so low that it's NOT profitable for ANY miner to mine, wouldn't that kill bitcoin?

Civil comments stand out :) 
Would you like a private link to more? How?
