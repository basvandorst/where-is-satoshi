I'd argue that Nimiq's model is more decentralized than the common wallet apps. Each browser is a blockchain node that establishes fast consensus using NIPoPoWs, and verifies balances quickly using a state Merkle tree (comparable to BCH's UTXO commitments). Browser nodes connect to each other using WebRTC, with full nodes acting as signaling servers. Transactions are relayed directly to the network. Lastly, [nimiq.com]( is a static website, so absolutely no server-side logic.
Most BTC wallets on the other hand have central databases providing transaction history and delegate trust to miners if they use SPV or don't validate the chain at all.
Having the recommended wallet interface hosted on a website is easily outweighed by the UX improvements. Nimiq is actively developing merchant integrations and the current focus is making blockchain payments as easy as using PayPal. Recently, a few working NIM-accepting online shops have opened (e.g. [
So most of the fast UX actually comes from a protocol level, not from compromising decentralization. The website itself is load balanced and has multiple failovers, so pretty hard to bring down. Even if half the servers go down, you can still access it. Pretty standard stuff.
You can always access NIM funds using all the other wallets created by devs &amp; community.
