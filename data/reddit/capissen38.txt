Exactly, I think people underestimate the sheer power that being first to market gives a particular technology.

*astronomical (hopefully)

Oh damn, that's like my nightmare.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:52:23
I don't have a screenshot, but they changed the graph. It had a huge spike from $3k to $8k and then back down to around $4k. A few minutes later, that was all missing.
Also, for anyone saying BCH results in faster transactions, that doesn't really matter if I try to move BCH and the transaction is still pending two hours later.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:31:59
No sarcasm, being completely sincere. Exposure in NYT will absolutely bring a site to its knees.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:06:06
Yep, some motley crew of TLA agencies.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:51:41
Yeah, I bought at like $9k just before the *last* BCH attack, and for a week and a half I was wondering, man, did I fuck up?
No, no I did not. At least, not as of this writing.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:47:06
Oh god it's too true. I have no idea what the price is. I saw it above $19k on Coinbase before it took a shit, Slush still reporting $16k.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:47:33


Spotted the libertarian.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:44:27
Damn I want to believe.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:14:51
Well that explains a lot.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:05:12
This is brilliant.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:53:13
Man the future is going to be fucking weird.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:55:14
I probably did, left over in Silk Road v1, v2, Hansa...
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:25:27
I just tell people I've smoked the most expensive dankedy dank dank that ever danked.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:44:19
I mean, I bought stuff with it yesterday, and also hodl. It's possible to do both. I keep seeing this narrative that no one uses it as a currency, and I can't imagine it's correct. Maybe the Bitcoin economy isn't as large as it could potentially become because of hodling, speculation, volatility, etc., but it certainly exists.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:42:08
Hansa as in Hansa Market, one of the leading darknet markets that was taken down by a coalition of law enforcement agencies earlier this year.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:07:19
Exactly. I could be a multi-millionaire right now if I'd saved BTC in 2012 instead of spending it on medical-grade darknet cannabis. You don't see me killing myself. *Kicking* myself, sure.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:11:10
I wish I knew, haven't done anything since Hansa got taken down. I'm sure there are some sites that have popped up since. Maybe check over in @_date: 2017-12-10 03:57:15

Yeah, CPU/GPU mining is almost literally like pissing in the ocean now. I haven't done the math, but pissing in the ocean might have *more* of an effect on the ocean than CPU mining would on Bitcoin in 2017.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:35:44
Yeah, I got a 0.1 BTC tip back in 2012, went straight to buying weed. I guess I've smoked about $1.5 million dollars worth of dark web medical-grade cannabis by now. I mean, those were good times, but gawd damn I wish I'd held.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:38:28
And then did a bunch of coke and ran for president. He's like some kind of a comic book character.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:11:24
Probably what the Coinbase folks are thinking right now.

Yeah, I have to remind myself that fortunes are being made and destroyed in a thousand industries every day that I don't even know about. People win the lottery, too. I still have a good life, all things considered.
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:34:28
I just got set up this week, pretty happy with them so far. Considered using the default Antminer pool, but seems borderline sketch.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:00:04
Hell, you can only buy Antminer with BCH in this most recent round, not sure how long it's been like that. Wanna mine BTC? Better pony up ~USD$1600 worth of BCH.

That's where I'm at and it's fantastic. I'd go for it. If you don't like it, it's pretty damn simple to switch to something else.
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:44:59
I've smoked like a million dollars of medical-grade cannabis.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:38:32
Oh damn dude, thanks! I've since seen the light and am sitting tight on some recently purchased BTC until like 2025 lol.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:50:54
So what happened there, some guy dumped a ton of BTC at USD$300 and it put a ceiling on the price until the market had a chance to absorb it?
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:35:58
At one point, I had like 1000 BTC back when it was around USD$35. I just try not to cry and console myself that I have smoked what maybe turned out to be the world's most expensive weed.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:43:15

@_date: 2017-11-16 19:18:06
It is, Slush has been running around ~830 Ph/s, but hit ~1000 Ph/s, which is ~1 Eh/s. My own little S9 hangs out at around 13.5 Th/s.
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:46:16
eBay, had to pay the reseller tax, but still got 13.5 Th/s for $3850 w/ power supply and two-day shipping. There are good deals on there if you poke around and don't want to deal with BCH to buy one from the manufacturer.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:52:48
[Reuters]( doesn't have much of a bias, nor does [AP]( [Wikipedia's current events portal]( is fairly neutral and good for keeping things in perspective from a global view.
That being said, neckbeard basement alt-right vloggers will accuse them all of being part of the vast deep state conspiracy. 2017 is a difficult time to speak rationally about these things without setting off the nutcases.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:00:21
Defeat of BCH at least.
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:10:48
Nah, they have options for both, I think the default is still BTC but who even knows now.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:39:40
Group buy, but yeah, something like that.
@_date: 2017-11-15 06:51:35
That's the hope.
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:04:37
Hey friend, we got in on the same day, it seems. Ah well, would be pretty unlikely for it to never hit those numbers again.

But for how long, I wonder.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:54:07
Yeah, not super impressed with Coinbase so far. I'll get the BTC I ordered this past Sunday this coming Tuesday. Whoops and/or ouch.
@_date: 2012-03-24 13:13:26
Legislation making this illegal in 3...2...1...
Edit: Christ people, I'm not saying that it would be a good thing, or that it will stop the progress of Bitcoin in any way. It's just that this is typically how this thing plays out.
@_date: 2012-07-09 03:13:37
I like how some douchebag has gone through and downvoted every last comment. Upvoting everyone because fuck that guy.
@_date: 2012-12-19 13:18:58
Considering the insane amounts of pressure that site operates under, the huge volumes, all the attempts at hacking that occur daily from both individuals and governments, I'm actually pretty impressed that this is their first breach (that I'm aware of) they've had.

Me too!
@_date: 2012-07-11 01:56:57
The government is not interested in inciting rebellion. They've gotten too good at keeping people complacent. I could see the president pulling the trigger on some domain seizures the same way he does drone attacks, but removing access to pornography wouldn't result in protests, it would result in riots.

Can't view without a Facebook account, would anyone mind posting the text?
@_date: 2012-12-19 13:19:41
Are you going to post this in every thread?
Oh, wait, yes you are, since you're the one selling these. Great.
@_date: 2012-12-16 16:45:25
You were being kind of a huge dick about it. I would have banned you, too.
@_date: 2012-11-26 23:55:52
Would they stand to gain anything by selling it under the table and using Bitcoin?
@_date: 2012-07-11 03:39:37
I think you're probably right.
@_date: 2018-03-06 03:14:49
Yeah, and enforcement was a joke because you could buy a t-shirt with the full key on it like three days later.

I gotta say, for a subreddit not really devoted to memes, this subreddit has some quality fucking memes.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:41:23
All my BTC for this outcome.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:22:33
From a technical standpoint, absolutely, but I'm not sure the adoption is there yet. Hansa didn't take it, and Zion didn't the last time I checked. Maybe Alpha does.
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:16:31
This is a good point, I don't think these ever sit idle except while in transit.
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:23:55
That would be more like, a river of blood that incidentally has a street running through it.

I don't know enough about Lightning to say one way or the other, but that statement is patently false.

He's one of mine! For a southern state, we've been doing pretty well with politicians lately.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:53:47
Pretty much where I'm at as well.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:51:07
Behind USD, it's the primary global instrument for purchasing contraband. If there's something you really want, and it's illegal where you are, Bitcoin is almost certainly how you get it. This makes it incredibly valuable. Just because McDonald's doesn't accept it doesn't mean it's a failed currency. Dig a little deeper.

It's certainly unfortunate that it's been brought into the spotlight, but security through obscurity is never a good long-term plan. The Pirate Bay is a good example of another site that enjoyed relative obscurity for a period of time, shot up in popularity overnight, and has repeatedly weathered attempts at shutting it down. I'm hoping Silk Road will find the same success.
@_date: 2011-06-06 22:57:58
Ah, okay, thanks for the clarification! That makes sense.
@_date: 2011-06-06 13:07:34
Wouldn't it take having control of just one Tor exit node through which Silk Road traffic passes for the feds to identify the actual IP address of the server? Forgive me if I'm oversimplifying this.
@_date: 2011-06-27 02:19:02
I hear a lot of big numbers like this bandied about, but is there any actual evidence or precedent that there's even a slight chance of this happening?
@_date: 2013-06-09 22:06:20

Or rather that of their employer.

Possibly, but it's been only after the first check for every company I've ever been with. Perhaps you're a fortunate exception.
