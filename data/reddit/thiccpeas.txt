When you say buy the dips like what do you mean? If it dips from 15000 to 14000 that shit is still expensive
@_date: 2018-09-24 14:14:53
Don’t call me buddy, guy!
@_date: 2018-09-24 14:38:24
I’m not your friend, guy!
@_date: 2018-05-25 09:10:28
Agreed 
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:35:01
How is it retarded if somebody who's new to the space is seeking guidance. Like you must have a micro penis the way half you guys go on about your knowledge of BTC lmao. Sorry I'm not stroking your ego!
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:32:04
If you're so upset don't sit on the internet and cast your anger or even respond to this thread. Go take a walk. Nobody said I specifically needed your response.
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:29:52
I don't understand why everybody is being a smart ass it's a genuine question. You don't have to be a dick about it. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:27:25
Yeah don't be a dick!
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:26:30
Please keep me posted I totally want to know if this is real wow 
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:49:57
Fair enough 
@_date: 2017-08-09 02:56:47
Can somebody explain this to a newbie?
@_date: 2017-08-16 13:41:23
Nobody told me anything. Everybody proceeded to try and bully me on this thread for asking a question because I'm a newbie. Don't know what you're getting out of this. Really.
@_date: 2017-08-09 02:56:28
What does this mean exactly?
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:25:36
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:05:49
These comments lmfao

@_date: 2017-08-16 11:37:54
That's awesome. Good for you dude. Last time I heard there was supposed to be a correction it happened but I held instead of sold and bought. Which I feel like I want to take advantage of this time around if it's supposed to correct.
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:00:43
Love the reference lol 
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:44:33
If that's the logic why do anything in life. Cause fuck you cant predict the future ammi right? Lol
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:46:20
I don't even know what lie I'm looking for it's a question. I wanted opinion. Not some guys calling me out on being a "noob". Like please.
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:39:17
You're absolutely right nobody knows I agree. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 14:38:55
Thanks for your insight. The Goldman Sachs woman Sheba Jafari made a pretty accurate prediction last time about the dip before the surge in pricing and that's what interested me. She said in order for an increase to happen that there needed to be a correction first.
@_date: 2017-08-16 13:42:25
Bahhhh shaddap you take yourself way too seriously
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:36:41
Seriously 
@_date: 2017-08-01 05:24:23
Well I'm entertained by this thread 
@_date: 2017-08-16 13:39:52
Why is this surprising. Did you suppose some friend of a friend told me? The same analyst who made the educated guess that there was gonna be a dip/correction a few weeks ago close to $2000 was correct and then it went back up like she said it would. Sooooooo..
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:15:35
Damn you! I wish I posted this first lol
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:26:17
Can you please elaborate? What’s gonna happen can I still see my funds in my account even though I don’t have my Trezor?
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:34:14
Obviously but as I said I tried using the wallets they listed and I can’t seem to use the recovery option as it prompts me for a 12 phrase password 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:16:47
Just to be clear it’s just those 24 words nothing else I need right?
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:31:53
So how do I go about using the seed? Do I have to wait til my new Trezor gets in?
@_date: 2018-11-07 01:12:51
What did I just watch
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:17:11
What does this mean and why is this significant to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:00:43
Hold til I die. Lost bitcoins 
@_date: 2017-10-03 23:34:16
What airport?
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:47:27
I fucking said this and got downvoted to oblivion fracking fack 
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:38:37
I’m not your brother, bud!
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:13:11
How do you short it
@_date: 2017-10-04 21:42:30
Is this real lol?
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:55:50
If I lost a Bitcoin while trading, is that considered a capital loss? Is this something I can claim?
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:11:45
"Also saying that blockchain will succeed, while Bitcoin won't is almost fucking stupid IMO."
Can you elaborate? I'm curious to hear your thoughts
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:57:00
I am Batman.
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:12:51
What came first I guess, the Blockchain or the coin?
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:47:27
I fucking said this and got downvoted to oblivion fracking fack 
@_date: 2017-10-02 23:30:37
Thanks all this is really helpful!
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:24:50
What's ath?
@_date: 2017-10-04 22:42:35
Y'all are crazy lol
@_date: 2017-10-24 13:18:06
Har har
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:40:58
This comment is absolute gold
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:42:33
This is amazing 
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:40:13
I don’t get this joke who’s Brian?
@_date: 2017-10-10 19:13:32
Second this
@_date: 2017-10-03 00:24:06
Killing puppies!?! Jeez that escalated quickly
@_date: 2017-07-13 05:25:57
Do you know if Litecoin will be affected in any way by BIP 148? Should I also move my Litecoins from coinbase to Trezor 
@_date: 2017-07-17 02:11:15
Bought at 2700 then at 2509 fack. I feel you :(
@_date: 2017-07-12 05:20:43
Yeah that went over my head sorry I'm not very tech saaavy. Well I chose to give bread wallet a test run but the fees to send coins out seem outrageous. I only sent $1.41 worth of bitcoin and then tried to send it back to my wallet and the fee is more than what I'm sending. Anybody know why that is?
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:12:18
Whyyyy so annoying
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:25:04
Lmao HODL brothers (and sisters :))
@_date: 2017-07-12 14:54:35
Do you know what the fees are for transferring bitcoin to and from your offline wallet? I don't really understand the tech jargon but let's say I wanted to transfer 1 bitcoin back into an online wallet what would the fee be? I'm trying to work out the logistics of costs and all and I'm wondering if I'm actually saving any money buying trezor, etc
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:20:05
Bitcoin is going to the moon?!

@_date: 2017-07-21 04:33:09
Gdax and Coinbase are the same company no?
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:47:26
Where do we cash out if we want to eventually sell? I'm in the US
@_date: 2017-07-15 02:09:06
Can I use Gemini in America?
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:02:46
Can somebody explain this all to me please I'm not a tech person by any means. Does that mean the split will likely not happen
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:44:08
What does rally hard mean?
@_date: 2017-07-13 12:16:23
My Trezor is arriving tomorrow. :)) Excited!
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:55:53
Have you tried Bitstamp before? 
@_date: 2017-07-16 10:04:43
For somebody who lives under a rock can you summarize this in the simple paragraph? Feel free to inbox me the whole Google thing if you're not comfortable on here.
@_date: 2017-07-15 16:27:20
Wow! That's discouraging
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:48:55
2 coins (:
@_date: 2017-07-21 04:17:01
Would also like to know what exchange you use since I'm wondering the same things! Something other than Coinbase that's backed up by somebody not working for the companies they promote!
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:47:40
Also I did the same just yesterday
@_date: 2017-07-21 03:11:37
Never!
