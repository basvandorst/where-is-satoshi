Im no expert on Bitcoinica but I have a lot of respect for this kid. He will always be able to claim it's ingenious creation. 
He's not down for pointless financial speculation, mad props.

Bruce seems to be one of the most sophisticated scamsters of the modern digital era. The tears on his show when MyBitcoin went down would make Eric Cantor Blush.
Disappearing from NY after a questionable conference and not fully responding to criticism must surely put it beyond doubt that he is not the wholesome spokesperson and commentator people desired. Imagine him contacting the FBI!
It has made for interesting watching though. Lucky BTC has an active blackmarket economy or it would spiral out of control.

Silk Road is btc. Plenty of large services on offer there

Yes, I'm sure the FBI are paying $51000+ salary for someone to make BTC fluctuate somewhat on forums. Get real.

I do agree with the sentiment that the guy should be left anonymous.

So the video at the bottom seemed to imply they were infiltrating the black markets. I don't see how they could infiltrate or raid BTC networks. In fact she didn't really sound like they had much of a clue on how to tackle the thing at all.
Fuck Pedophilia and Weapons trade using TOR or BTC.

This market is so speculative, it's disturbing to see people try to make a buck out of it. Bitcoin wasn't created for this purpose and I'm sure I'll be unpopular for voicing concerns about it.
It's not a ponzi scheme. Almost.

The other issue that comes to my mind is there is relatively little real activity associated with BTC. Other than SR, where is most of the demand. From others who want to invest in BTC. I understand the value of liquidity but at the moment it's mostly liquidity to other speculators.
