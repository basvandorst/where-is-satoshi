Up until a few decades ago, cash was also a form of credit. Take a look at a dollar bill. It says "Federal Reserve Note". What that used to mean is that you could exchange that note with a bank (the Federal Reserve) for "real money", like gold or silver bars and coins. The government guaranteed this.
People got away from carrying sacks of gold/silver coins to carrying bank notes that promised some amount of gold/silver. Now people moved away from carrying bank notes to carrying credit cards.
But Bitcoin is now a hybrid form of cash where you don't need to carry a bag of it but you can access the entire value directly without a note from a bank.
Is that something that itself will ever be mainstream? I highly doubt it. People are too accustomed to the protection offered by credit card. Bitcoin itself offers no consumer protection, by design. Once a transaction is in the ledger it can't be reversed without the cooperation of both sides.
Mainstream use and massive growth can only happen with an off-chain scaling and settlement layer and some novel new credit/escrow businesses that can offer protection to both the buyer and seller and allow seamless transactions that are just as easy as a credit card. But really I don't think Bitcoin is positioned well here, that's tacking on functionality it was never intended to have. Ethereum is a much more flexible platform to implement something like this. But Bitcoin still has a ton of value as a store of value and for large settlements. Ironically, the types of settlements where both parties trust each other, since Bitcoin was intended as a trustless way to transfer value.

There's no information provided and so far it's just vaporware. There's nothing in the video to suggest it's off-chain transactions, that's just speculation based on previous announcements. In fact, the video shows a donation happening in USD, not BTC. The video or tweet make no mention of Bitcoin at all. I have no idea why this was even posted here.
I would be extremely wary of using any technology that claims to build on bitcoin but was developed in complete secrecy. I suspect that if Bitcache makes use of Bitcoin at all, it's in a centralized way that gives them control over where the money goes and who gets how much. What good is an off-chain microtransaction if "off chain" is on their private servers that they control?

btcforkmonitor.info will wait for two split blocks before declaring a fork on their site:


I think this means that the Bitcoin ABC client needs to mine two blocks on its fork before the status updates, which could take a while.
Edit: I wonder if it's just slow because of the reports of the client crashing?

Bitcoin exchanges for money don't happen on the blockchain between individual wallets, it happens on bitcoin exchanges. The exchanges keep their own ledgers and only move bitcoin between wallets when necessary.
These exchanges are the markets where the bitcoin price is set by market participants.
When you see a single wallet with tens or even hundreds of thousands of bitcoins, there are likely hundreds or thousands of different people in control of them, trading them on exchanges or storing them in online wallets.

You don't seem to understand what the key ideas of open source and blockchains. The ability to fork a project is a fundamental concept of both.
The fact that the blockchain can be forked is an extremely important idea. It's the basis of consensus and the concept that the longest blockchain is the "real" bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin was designed to allow it and survive it. It's part of the robustness of the network.
This isn't hijacking resources and your guidelines are made up head-cannon. You're inventing an idea of legitimacy that has no basis in reality.

Right. It's not much different than when a company spins off one of their units and gives you stock in that unit. The companies operate independently and some will go up, some will go down.
Check out this chart of what you'd get if you invested in Philip Morris around 1988:
If you held on to your shares, you'd now have stock in Altria, Philip Morris International, Kraft Foods, Mondelez, Ralcorp, and Post Holdings.
This is what I see happening to Bitcoin forks. In 10-20 years there might be 4-5 successful forks that each have their own niche. Some will be used for cash transactions, some will be better used as a store of value. It doesn't take much effort for a store/site to accept coins from different forks - the software for the different forks is mostly identical. It'll be like when you see a list of 5-10 different credit cards accepted at payment terminals.
I don't see why everyone thinks this is such a big deal. I don't know why the mods here freak out over talk about anything other than The One True Bitcoin(tm).

I've been around long enough to know of Kim back when he used the name Kimble on Efnet IRC. I know a few people that worked for him back in the late 90s. He claimed to to hack PBX systems, but he didn't do shit. He paid kids to hack the PBX's for him, then he'd sell the access codes. He paid kids to card shit for him too. Anything he wanted, he'd find a patsy who could get it for him. He would buy an exploit from one person, then pay other people to use it to hack shit.
I think he's a smart dude, but he doesn't know shit about tech - he just knows how to manipulate people in a way that gets him more money. That's his whole fucking game and he's been at it for a while. He got caught a bunch of times but people still believe his shit.

What you did is pretty shady. You came up with a way to cheat at a game and people on the internet gave you money for it. That's not exactly an honorable way to earn an income since you're potentially preventing someone else from getting that income. Depending on how the "hack" works, it could be considered stealing from the developers or from other players.
So good luck explaining that one in a way that doesn't make you sound like a criminal.
Explaining bitcoin is easier, it's just a way to transfer money on the internet like PayPal or VenMo. Bitcoins are tokens that can be traded for cash. One person buys a bitcoin with cash, they transfer the bitcoins to you, you exchange the bitcoins for cash.
Also, don't forget to save some of the money you earned, you're going to have to file a tax return to report the income and you might owe some taxes. Congrats, you're pretty much an adult now!

This shouldn't be true unless blocks are nearly full. Fees are more of a reflection of how soon the sender wants their transaction to be processed - higher fees will let them "skip ahead" in line and get included in a block before someone with a lower fee.
Also, the reason that people use the ratio of fee to transaction value is because that's how it's calculated for other financial transactions everywhere else in the world. You can't do this comparison unless the units are like. Using fee in BTC per byte is only useful for comparing bitcoin transactions over time and is useless for describing the real cost to send fiat via BTC - one of the major use cases.
@_date: 2017-08-28 23:39:33


That's because of Coinbases's limits and why it takes a while to get your limit increased. They've also been known to ban people "for no reason", because their fraud triggers were hit. They go out of their way to eliminate any potentially sketchy/risky behavior, including people who transfer money to gambling site wallets or sell on localbitcoin.
It sounds like Celery didn't do any sort of risk mitigation and got wiped out, then took money from their users to cover it. It won't end well for them.
Also, the 60 day reversal is 100% bullshit. There's no blanket 60 day reversal policy for ACH. There are very limited reasons when ACH reversals are allowed, and most have to be done within 5 days. The only time you have 60 days is in cases of provable fraud. In that case, it's likely that the deposits Celery is complaining about were stolen in the first place. Which, if they did more due diligence, they would have easily spotted.
People like to complain about how it takes 5-7 days to get money into Coinbase, but Coinbase won't close up shop and take 80% of your funds because they fuck up.
Edit: Apparently Celery had limits too, or at least they do now:

You could at least do a tiny bit of research before writing speculative articles.
The signal data is sent at a rate of 50 bits/second.
I'm not sure why you picked GPS as the satellite system of choice when it's very limited and operated exclusively by governments.
Why wouldn't they use a commercial satellite network? The XM/Sirius satellite system is already capable of sending mass amounts of data to devices. It's already used to send real-time traffic data to in-car navigation systems. Or maybe they could use the Iridium system, which has been looking for more uses other than satellite telephones. There's also Dish and the other satellite TV providers that ALREADY OFFER INTERNET CONNECTIONS from their satellites (for downstream anyways, not upstream).
TL;DR: You picked the single worst satellite network to speculate on in your article and nothing about it makes any sense.

Do you have any actual data to back that up? I spent some time comparing US stock indices and bitcoin and found no correlation at all on any metrics (volume, price, etc). I'd love to see your analysis, maybe I missed something.

It really depends which exchange. If you're using an exchange in another country and its run by people who are completely anonymous to you, then it's a pretty bad idea to keep your coins there.
I'm less worried about Coinbase. As a US citizen, they operate legally in my country. They have a physical address here. The board of directors and executive management are well known, as are the investors. They have insurance policies to protect account holders in the event of hacks on their infrastructure. They have a dedicated security team.
That last part is important. Do you really think that as an individual you can do a better job protecting your coins than a group of professionals paid to protect your coins? Based on posts I see here about people losing their coins by doing idiotic things like re-using passwords and exposing VMs to the internet, it doesn't seem likely.
Sure, Coinbase has had its problems and they've been going through some growing pains, but it's safer for most people to keep their coins there than in a wallet on the same PC they surf the web from or in a shady exchange run out of a country they've never been to with ties to organized crime.

It probably wouldn't have gone over well for the 18 month period from the end of 2013 to mid-2015 when the price had been going down steadily and was 80% off the highs from a year earlier. There were people who dumped their retirement or their kids' college funds into bitcoin at $600-800 and were watching it trade for $200 a year later. None of those people were saying "man I should have bought at $1000!".

There was a study a while ago that found more money does increase overall happiness up to a certain point. I think the number was around $75k/yr. That's the point where you have basic financial security and most of the problems in your life aren't money problems. Having much more money than that doesn't automatically make you happier because other life issues override money issues.
Health is similar, depending on where you live. If you have health insurance and can afford to see a doctor and get treatment, you can be relatively healthy outside of rare diseases or accidents.
Regarding time, money can buy that up to a certain point too. Being able to take a vacation is a luxury for many people. Same with owning a car and not having a massive commute to your job. Poor people who have to work multiple low-paying jobs and need to take public transportation everywhere simply don't have time for leisure and family like more wealthy people have.
So yeah you can say "money can't buy you time, health, or happiness", but you need a base level of income or wealth to have free time, access to health care, and the freedom to be happy.

You can't really expect someone to tell you what to do if you won't tell us what position you're in.

You didn't read the rest of that. It depends on the circumstances.
The definition of "security" comes from the Securities Act of 1933: 
It's a long and confusing read, but the TL;DR is that if they make any claims that the token you buy entitles you to ANYTHING, it's a security. That's why a bunch of ICOs have language saying that you're basically paying for nothing and are entitled to nothing and the tokens themselves can't be traded for anything of value.
The problem is that even if they say that, then decide they do want to give the ICO purchaser something in exchange for the tokens, it's now a security regardless of the original agreement.

It's awesome that the report from this article came out two weeks ago, and at that time it was reported that Bitcoin would drop to $1900. But now they're reporting that it could go up to $3900.
But the source is the same fucking report.
The problem isn't GS here, it's idiotic "journalists" who report a research note and cherry-pick which parts they want to report.
Edit: Here's an example of one of the shittier articles from two weeks ago:
This one is so bad that they couldn't even get the analyst's gender right. Sheba Jafari is a she, not a he.

Wow, this article is bad.






Nope, the browser was released in 1994.


First of all, they just copied and pasted the phrase "signals the dawn of a new industry" straight from wikipedia. 
Second, the "Netscape Moment" refers to Netscape's IPO spawning the idea of an unprofitable company launching an IPO which led to the dotcom bubble. It was mostly unheard-of before then. But the article's author is trying to link it to the growth of internet users. They're completely misinterpreting what "Netscape Moment" is.

People really need to understand this. The same math that makes bitcoin secure for trustless transactions also makes it easy to prove you're the one who initiated a transaction if they find your Bitcoin wallet and prove you had the secret key.
It's pseudonymous in that it's difficult to track you down if a Bitcoin address is all they have to go on, but if they find you through other means then a Bitcoin wallet can provide a slam-dunk to prosecution. 
I don't know how anyone can suggest things like "Bitcoin is anonymous" or "Bitcoin can't be seized" in light of cases like Ross Ulbricht.

Coinbase recommends using Google Authenticator: 
They claim it's "most secure" but doesn't explain what the risks with Authy are.

It's a mechanical typewriter, it doesn't do calculations. But someone did write a blog post about calculating hashes on paper. They got 0.67 hashes per day: 
BTW, that's also a great link to understand exactly what happens when bitcoin miners are doing work.

The chain analysis companies work just fine on the existing blockchain, they don't need any help from developers.

Yeah that's nuts. People there are saying "who cares if he lied then if what he's saying now makes sense". But it doesn't, his whole talk was nonsense. And people were saying that it made them a believer.
I do think gets too obsessed with personalities over technology sometimes, but at some point you just have to call people out for being liars and frauds and stop giving credence to anything they say.

"All the reports" are blogspam originating from the Fortune article, which quotes another report that can only be accessed by subscription: 
Just because a bunch of people repeat something, that doesn't make it true. is doing a huge disservice to the community making up a fake quote ("passwords and security settings") that completely changes what was originally reported. People upvote it because that's what they want to believe. It's sad.

Coinbase has handled hard forks before. With Ethereum, they chose not to offer long-term support ETC and let people withdraw them for a couple of months before dropping support.
In their FAQ they say they'll handle hard forks on a case-by-case basis. I see no reason to suspect that they'd completely fuck over every single one of their bitcoin customers by just throwing away or keeping their coins on the "losing" chain.
At this point, there's really no reason for them to make a decision or even pick a side. Deciding what to do now could backfire on them, so it makes sense to just wait to see what happens.

It's hilarious that you tell someone to "man up" when you spout weak shit like this:


Holy shit dude, maybe it's your diet? You might want to see a doctor and get that checked out.

is some kind of propaganda account that only posts tweets and videos with character assassinations / namecalling. There's no actual content to anything they post. No technical or economic discussion, just making up dumb names for people they don't like.

Doubt it. He's dumb as a brick and likely as poor as one too, that's why has to take sponsorship deals from shady ICOs.
Getting punched in the head for a living isn't great for your mental health, but Mayweather has been a complete nutjob asshole since before he went pro.
Edit: If you take your investment advice from this idiot, you deserve to lose your money. Even if Mayweather is somehow still rich, he didn't get rich from investing...
Edit edit: By "this idiot" I meant his social media management team. I doubt he'd actually be able to correctly spell cryptocurrency or ethereum when tagging it.

In the government's eyes, all of the coins/money in the exchange were part of a money laundering operation. Whether or not you knew what was going on is irrelevant - the money itself was part of an alleged crime.

I don't like meeting with people who are actively hostile to me either. I get that some people love having a lively debate, but I'd rather stab myself in the face than willingly meet with someone who wants to "discuss issues" and accuses me of "hiding behind censorship and troll armies". Seriously, what good could come of that? Why would anyone want to subject themselves to something like that?
