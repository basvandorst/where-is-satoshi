if you're wary of anything malicious, just click 'show code' on the userstyles page and have a look at the css. it's purely stylistic changes.

several weeks ago, all of a sudden vircurex went offline. there was a lot of very confusing, fishy funny-business that happened immediately thereafter. including a twitter account that popped up speaking for the exchange, followed by a user on bitcointalk that spoke for vircurex saying that that wasn't their twitter. the sentence you posted 'we are still waiting to hear back from the bank regarding our remaining account balance' sounds exactly like the kind of stuff i remember reading when vircurex went down. it feels super shady, scammy, and untrustworthy. but vircurex came back online a few days later. the moral of the story is, any statement they put out is better than no statement, no matter how thoughtless it may seem.

When I made this I thought the exact same thing about the April surge to 266.. it happens in a flash in the GIF. This particular video was really inspiring and is fun to watch if you like this kind of thing:

hate to be a naysayer, but for something that's supposed to be 'made in germany' (rich history of beautiful graphic design) this product looks tacky and cheap.

that's weird, i'm not able to reproduce that bug. ive tested it on firefox and chrome at different scales other than 100% too. using windows7. what browser/os are you using? i'd like to investigate what's causing that problem.

nice system.. my suggestion: make a *much* more informative, simple, and user-friendly page for people that have just received a bitcoin tip, instead of just the 'site owners' paragraph on   that's definitely the most imperative section that needs to be explained like you're 'explaining to a 5 year old'.

lol listen closely at the end, 'one dollar equals one hundred bitcoin'

I disagree with the assertion that the processing power spent on 'real problems that exist naturally' are objectively more important, meaningful, or significant than something like mining for Bitcoin. Someone with no interest in extra terrestrial life could argue that projects like SETI are essentially a 'waste of time'. Even if all this processing power was used in the pursuit of curing cancer, the fundamental goal of such a pursuit would be for human beings to live longer; for what's the point of living if you've got nothing interesting to live for? "It's kind of like rounding up the world's greatest minds and making them do Sudokus for nickels." If people were interested in watching the greatest minds do sudokus for nickels, by all means, have at it.

dear bitinstant, might want to scrap any mention of 'liberty reserve' from your craigslist ad.
