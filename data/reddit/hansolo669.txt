Tisk tisk, debugging live?

Only one BTC trading site has been hacked (afaik) and considering that the currency has risen from only a few USD per coin to 41 USD per I would say its a stable currency. (And I'm kicking myself for not investing/mining sooner).

My main card runs at about 240mhash(amd 7770), and I'm planning on supplementing it with a 7970ghz edition(should be ~800mhash) sooner rather than later.

I think more accurately it went from "Good, but this could hurt us in the short term" to "Great job community!"

That's them! Pretty good software IMO, basic modes and an advanced config mode.

Most people have the sense to call java java and JavaScript JavaScript.
It's not the worst thing to come out of the early Internet era...

Considering I dont pay a specific power rate, only rent, and thats factored in to regular living costs, I would say not. However for most you are correct.

They are decently powerfull. Personally I use my 13in pro to add to my total mining powah(adds ~40mh/s).

I have managed to get a couple bucks these past few days with my 7770. There must be something off with your setup. The difficulty hasn't gone up yet(thankfully).

When they start shipping I figure I'll toss down some money on one of those. 
I'm going to be buying the 7970 for reasons beyond mining (application performance, gaming), getting a few BTC out of it while I sleep is a bonus.

Lets say you get 4 of the most powerful cards today. 4 * ~800mhash = 3200mhash total. at current exchange rates would net you about 440 USD a month, paying off the rig in roughly 4 and a half months(I was a bit generous with my estimates, adjust up and down as needed).
That being said, it's questionable how much longer pure GPU mining will remain truly profitable. With AISC's floating closer to reality the difficulty is going to take a huge jump, leaving all but a few already paid off GPU mining "datacenters" obsolete.
If you just want to play with the currency I would say try it out on your computer. See how it goes, then see if you want to invest in mining or trading(or both!).

Assuming no coins got double spent all service could have continued as normal. Both chains were receiving transactions.
