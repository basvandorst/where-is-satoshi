I don’t think it will. Too many whales using it not as a currency but as a stock. Whenever it gets to a certain price whales will dump it

I’ve bought at 8k, 9k, 11k and 12k. Haven’t sold any yet. Thinking about buying more. The way I look at it, in this parabolic trend, is ***right now*** the exact point where we’re gonna peak? Looking at the trend, the odds would be extremely low of that being the case. just have to be extremely aware of the market. Because once the tank happens it’s gonna happen FAST so need to be ready to lock in the profits

It’s all relative. Buying $140 worth of BTC at 9200 felt really good until you hear people talking about the thousands worth of BTC they bought at 3000.  And while you may feel like you’re missing out on the fun, if you speak to those who bought huge amounts at the ATH a couple years ago... they wish they could have switched places and been spectating from the sidelines. Don’t stress over it, especially at your age. Time is the most valuable asset we’re given and you’ve got an abundant supply

How do abra fees compare to Coinbase? Getting tired of the crazy fees. They ding you when you buy and ding you when you withdraw. It’s bullshit

I regret clicking that click baity video

Hate to be an asshat but this is 6th grade math man. Let’s assume BTC is 10k € right now
400 € / 10k = x / 100k
10,000x = 40,000,000
You’d have 4,000 €
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:36:16
Sounds like a plan. Thanks for the advice
@_date: 2019-06-22 23:11:54
When’s the next dip you’d be willing to buy at? Tryna do the same but don’t know when it’ll drop below 9k again. Too soon to see if there will be a new floor tho

You come on this sub asking if “you’re doing this right”, get some criticism, then get pissed off... if the “proof is in the pudding” why even bother asking? Clearly you’re a guru

I FOMOd in at 12k and obviously I’m getting rekt in the short term but I have a hard time believing 13,800 is the peak from here on out. If it dips below 8k I’ll probably buy more
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:05:10
If i knew the answer to that I’d quit my job and trade full time
That being said, I’m a proud hodler so I’m really not losing much sleep over the ups and downs. Just closing my eyes
