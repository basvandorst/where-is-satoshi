It has 8 exchanges and pretty much every altcoin too. Check the "markets" dropdown menu in the upper right. 
also you can create a dashboard to monitor many exchanges at once here

You can be a vegetarian and a gun owner.. just sayin
@_date: 2014-07-01 10:23:28
Gotta get the word out somehow :/
@_date: 2014-07-01 10:48:44
Thanks :)  Something I could definitely look into... I'm very open to suggestions and can usually be reached in the chat box pretty easily.

Whoever wrote this is an idiot...

Bound to happen sometime!! Nice work guys!
I can imagine this would probably include Tor style encryption allowing your "IP address" or identifier to be more like a public key...
@_date: 2014-07-01 10:53:38
people are so rude sometimes... hard work went into this site
@_date: 2014-07-01 10:51:26
once its loaded the price updates are faster.. its just a little slow to render the chart at the moment. There are 30 different indicators you can add! lots of stuff to load
@_date: 2014-07-01 10:24:50
just give it a second to render the chart... once it's loaded it updates very fast.
@_date: 2014-07-01 10:24:01
Its all HTML5.. you can delete some of the charts if its too much. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 06:20:03
It describes the event as a fact-finding mission, where it will also discuss the possibility of a state-level regulations specifically for digital currencies, called a ‘BitLicense’.
The hearings will see representatives from the financial, legal, government, and academic sectors. They will include Barry Silbert, founder of the Bitcoin Investment Trust, and the Winklevoss brothers, who are in the process of launching their own bitcoin ETF.

Lets all throw this guy a little BTC... give us an address CatEngine.

maybe check out the more lightweight dashboard. 
No need to have 4 tabs open :D
@_date: 2014-01-25 07:24:50
But do they accept BQC?

It will eventually have more automation and calculators for things like arbitrage. They are actually already in the works :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:09:23
No... They are suggesting that you DON'T cash out because you cant get back in...
@_date: 2013-06-27 01:04:43
They will be more legit once they implement API Keys with permissions! :-p We've been trying to get a hold of someone over there to do this so we can add them on  but they just said "they're discussing it".  If someone from campbx is reading this... please consider :)
@_date: 2013-06-17 22:45:16
thanks :)
@_date: 2013-06-24 16:29:58
thank you for sharing as well :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:05:55
Appreciated :)
@_date: 2013-06-23 16:48:28
You would like the ability to fund exchange accounts from the cryptrader.com dashboard?
@_date: 2013-06-24 19:10:05
Hey, do you guys use API keys with permissions? Also, just a heads up, your logo image is broken...
@_date: 2013-06-26 17:41:20
check out the trollbox on  :)
@_date: 2013-06-26 00:38:07
Yeah, we could do that. If you join I will add it to the list of things to add.
@_date: 2013-06-13 03:20:11
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-06-26 17:41:44
Of course BTC-e data is offline at the moment
@_date: 2013-06-22 22:48:58
lol... wrong thread?
@_date: 2013-07-01 21:20:02
Theoretically this should be possible... its just a keypair. It has nothing to do with the mining hashing algorithm.
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:57:24
well its free for the first 100 trades.. I hope to make money from subscribers who make money using this on the regular.
@_date: 2013-06-24 18:25:07
They don't use API keys with permissions... which is really insecure. 
@_date: 2013-06-13 08:03:56
@_date: 2013-06-13 15:04:33
soon... 
However, only for charting purposes. they need to start using API keys (and not user logins) first before we can safely integrate them for trading. 
@_date: 2013-06-19 17:15:43
Hah.... nice. Paper isn't bug proof either. 
@_date: 2013-06-18 05:38:24
LOL... What sensitive information? An email? 
That is to make sure you don't get locked out...
@_date: 2013-07-19 17:46:23
Totally the Tony Stark of the real world...
@_date: 2013-06-17 22:01:38
Maybe I should just delete and repost as a text post?
@_date: 2013-06-23 16:46:51
Hey thanks for the suggestions... BTC-TC is already in the works and I'm looking into BitFunder now. 
I wouldn't leave my coins on an exchange for too long, but the idea is to decentralize where all those funds are while trading. and be able to make sure that your overall worth is going up while you are day trading. 
@_date: 2013-06-26 18:41:26
Like crashes chrome? I think it just looks frozen because its stalling on the BTC-e data. Just give it like 5 seconds to error out on that. then the rest of the page loads. We are working on a fix for when API's go offline like this.
@_date: 2013-06-20 02:03:00
Guess we could allow uppercase letters..  was just trying to keep things looking uniform. 
@_date: 2013-06-26 21:54:07
@_date: 2013-06-19 17:16:35
Are all the messages stored in like a blockchain? Seems kinda unnecessary... but a very cool concept!
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:45:53
You mean something like this? 
@_date: 2013-12-19 08:37:04
Anyone who bought at 1200 without money they were willing to throw away... like seriously... what were you thinking?
@_date: 2013-06-19 15:20:37
thanks for the input... definitely all coming in the neat future :)
@_date: 2013-06-26 19:31:57
K... Thanks! Removed frozen BTC-e data from homepage... Should work now.
@_date: 2013-06-26 18:55:59
trollbox sounds more fun... but yes, its actually more of a help box. 
@_date: 2013-06-19 20:41:08
Thanks! Right now the site is free to use, giving you access to all the live charts customizable dashboard and net worth calculator, but if you want to execute trades directly from the interface, we ask for a small monthly or yearly fee. 
If you're day trading, the amount of time saved using this will pay for itself almost immediately :)
@_date: 2013-06-17 21:59:39
k thanks... new to reddit. Wasn't sure the best way to word the title... Is there a way to edit it?
@_date: 2013-06-22 22:59:58
LTC/BTC is there... click the "add portal" button at the top right. If you're not logged in you will have to delete some charts to make room for others.
More control over charts like zooming coming very soon :)
@_date: 2013-06-20 17:43:24
With the amount of money gox has, seems like should have had a new trading engine months ago. 
@_date: 2013-06-13 18:45:32
Thanks... glad you like it.
@_date: 2013-06-19 17:17:59
Josh has to be one of the worst PR people in history. He is drunk on power. lol
