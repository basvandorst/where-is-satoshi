The difficulty is (essentially) expressed as a really large number.  
  
The goal of the miners is to find a hash which is 'smaller' has more leading zeroes) than the difficulty target.  
  
To adjust the difficulty, a window of blocks are taken and compared to the target number of blocks over that period.

Using Bitcoin is a political act.  
  
Bitcoin does not allow the 'powers that be' to continue censoring, seizing and surveilling^sp? our financial sovereignty.  
  
Censoring a transaction or seizing Bitcoin is quite literally impossible (assuming the user takes precautions in it's storage).  
  
In terms of privacy and surveillance, though Bitcoin itself may not provide privacy (yet), intra-crypto exchange is extremely liquid and there are a wealth of privacy options available that do provide reasonable privacy.  
  
TL;DR  
Bitcoin provides attributes which are not available when using the current banking system and using it is fundamentally a political act.

Review the block creation charts(and thus coin creation) for any network that implemented it. It responds erratically, incentivizes network jumping, and actually makes it easier for miners to game the algorithm, rather than more difficult as it was intended to do. This was all well known for *years* prior to bcash implementing the algorithm. It failed as miserably this time as it had *many* times in the past against multi-pool hopping.  
  


  
At it's core, yes.  
If the software fails (which is quite possible, as illustrated by multiple dead altcoins) then the community and all other aspects have nothing to gather around.  
It begins and ends with software.

In the same way that one of the most powerful lobby's in Washington, the MPAA, can't stop torrents, crypto/Bitcoin is quite literally impossible to stop in any meaningful way.

GDAX is a full-featured exchange, which enables the coinbase service. Coinbase itself is a more 'user friendly' direct purchase platform. I am sure others can fill you in on some of the mistakes the company has made recently which have led many to believe they are not working for the improvement of Bitcoin.  
  
Segwit changed the way in which transactions are stored in Bitcoin to improve efficiency of the software, a deeper explanation than that would exceed the understanding of those without technical skills.  
  
Lightning is an open source protocol which attempts to allow trustless transactions off chain, directly between users. If adopted widely it appears to offer scaling well into the future.  
  
Shitcash(BCH) is a fork of Bitcoin which didn't implement segwit, primarily because it prevented certain miners from utilizing patented technology, ASIC Boost, to gain a competitive advantage. Instead of off chain solutions, BCH chose a short-term solution: increasing the block size. If it doesn't implement off chain solutions it will either be unable to scale even a single magnitude further, or if they choose to increase the block size further will become centralized into data centers due to the difficulty of syncing the chain.  
  
Meh, not the best answer, but it is all the time I am willing to commit to it at this time.

Not sure if English is a second language for you, or if you are trolling :P  
  
Regardless, what you fail to understand (if I am understanding your comment) is that the competition doesn't have a solution either.  
  
Larger block size isn't a solution, they will run into the same scaling problem and likely just as quickly (if they get users) given that faucet and other super low value use cases will absorb the extra space.  
  
Other methods, such as 'the tangle' haven't proven to be decentralized yet, and thus aren't direct competition. They are something else entirely, and lack the censorship resistance, permissionless innovation, and other attributes of Bitcoin.  
  
Some networks are flatly owned and operated by a central party, and are using the block chain simply as a buzz word, with no technical reason to do so.  
  
So, while Bitcoin hasn't scaled yet, the competition hasn't either (or don't need to as they are a centralized system and thus should simply be using a database).  
  
If that is your cup-of-tea, I would recommend stock in Paypal or Apple, as they likely are accomplishing similar objectives at a lower cost with more efficiency.

You fundamentally misunderstand how mining works.  
  
Changing the difficulty manually would have ZERO change on block time mid-term, it would simply readjust back up to where it now.  
  
Changing the block time as you suggest *would* change the difficulty, as it would adjust downward until the block time was reached.  
  
That said, the number of miners mining, and thus the expenditure on energy would remain exactly the same in either situation.  
  
Further, there is no data to suggest that halving the block reward reduces mining.  
  
In fact, though I haven't run the numbers, I would expect there to be a negative correlation, if only due to the consistent halving and consistent growth in mining over time (if no causal).

Price gouging is only possible in a supply restrained market.  
By definition, that means that there is room for the manufacturer to produce more units which will instantly sell.  
  
So, while the gouging itself isn't helpful, the gouging is a symptom of a situation that *does* benefit the manufacturer if it can ramp up production.

Your lightning node will keep multiple channels open automatically, without you manually choosing the channel endpoints.  
  
These channels can be rebalanced from within Lightning, to ensure the funds are available on a single channel, if needed.  
  
Essentially, your lightning node will do it's best to connect you to the lightning network (as the core client does with nodes) in such a way as to give you best connectivity. This algorithm can be fine-tuned to prevent centralization if it does occur.

The developers of shitcash are so incompetent and unfamiliar with the crypto space that they implemented a re-targeting algorithm that had already *previously* failed on a dozen other crypto networks.

It was a bad idea because the algorithm is a failed algorithm.  
There needs to be nothing more said in that regard.  
  
It should matter when assessing shitcash because the developers of a software *are* the beginning and end of that software. Software, any software, does nothing more than simply automate the thoughts and processes of the developer.  
  
If those thoughts and processes are faulty, the software has no value.

It is actually a bit more complicated than that, but that covers the basics.  
  
Consider a river with a village on it's shore.  
Everyone shits in the river.  
It's a shared resource.  
If there is too much shit, no one can drink the water and then the local bottled water company basically controls the people of the village.  
BCH has decided to let everyone shit in the river as much as they want.  
Eventually, this will make the water undrinkable and the village will have to rely on the water bottler.  
Bitcoin has decided to set up an auction where the villagers can bid on who gets to shit in the river, but never so many that the water becomes undrinkable.  
In addition, Bitcoin has started construction on drilling a well(lightning), so that everyone can drink from the well for nearly free.

You'd be better off with Doge, at least the devs have proven they have the skill to keep a crypto currency network running.  
  
Bcash devs implemented a diff. targetting algo that had already failed many times in the space, it wasn't a new algorithm.  
  
I can only assume that they were unaware that the retargetting algorithm had failed many times previously, which suggests they don't know the space at all, as it has existed for years and had a proven record of failure.

Don't believe what you are told.  
Instead, do the research yourself.  
In this case, it is extremely simple.  
  
**Claims:**  
  
* Bitcoin is less than a decade old.  
* The more difficult and expensive an action is, the less people will do it.  
* The storage, bandwidth and time cost of syncing the chain is a function of the block size.  
Now, for your homework.  
  
**Download the core reference client and sync the chain.**  
  
  
Since this difficulty is a function of block size, increasing the block size changes the *rate of growth* of the chain.  
After less than a decade, the Bitcoin chain is already a reasonably large investment of time and resources to sync.  
  
How long would you like this revolution to last?  
Ten years, a hundred, a thousand?

Lightning is less complicated than most think.  
  
It is essentially just passing back and forth a Bitcoin transaction (without pushing it to the chain).  
  
So, if I was to send you funds, we would edit our existing off-chain transaction and sign it.  
  
This allows either party to, at any time, push the transaction to the actual chain and prevent cheating.  
  
However, it also allows us to send funds back and forth repeatedly without ever actually putting it on chain.  
  
On top of that idea, we add the idea that there is a larger network of the above arrangements. So, as long as there is a 'path' from one node to another in that network, we can make sure that all agreements in that chain are updated correctly, and get to any node in the network.  
  
That is about it :D

There are three issues:  
  
* Are they Bitcoin?  
* Are they **your** Bitcoin?  
* How do you verify that?  
  
  


  
Is there a transaction on chain (or, could there be, in the case of lightning)?  
If so, then, yes, they are Bitcoin.  
  


  
Do you control the private key which corresponds to the public key to which the 'coins' belong?  
If so, then, yes, they are **your** Bitcoin.  
  


  
This is where things get a bit more complicated.  
Bitcoin *isn't* special in it's ability to manage the transaction of funds.  
In fact, it's design makes it quite poor and inefficient at keeping a ledger.  
Bitcoin's value proposition is that it is capable of keeping track of the transaction of funds among a network of individuals who do not trust each other.  
There is no 'trusted third party'.  
This lack of a third party (a bank or money transmitter) adds a variety of secondary value propositions, such as making it uncensorable, permissionless, and unseizable.  
In order to enjoy the value propositions of Bitcoin, you must run software which is 'trustless'.  
Lightning maintains this trustless nature by providing the opportunity to 'opt-out' of the system at any time, without the loss of funds, by broadcasting the last state of the system that you agreed to and 'signed'.  
SPV clients maintain *some* of this trustless nature, usually with some additional costs.  
Because you do not sync and verify the chain, you do not personally apply some of the consensus rules.  
This re-introduces a third-party.  
Additionally, this can also reduce your privacy, though bloom filters and other strategies have been applied to reduce this exposure.  
  
---  
  
TL;DR  
If there isn't a transaction on chain or a transaction 'in the pipe' that is assured of confirmation, it isn't Bitcoin.  
If you don't control the private key, then it isn't *your* Bitcoin.  
If you don't sync and verify the chain yourself, or you rely on a third-party in some other way, it isn't trustless.  
  
If you are operating Bitcoin in a way that isn't trustless, you don't enjoy some of the attributes which make Bitcoin special, and might consider using some other 'trusted' system, instead.

It isn't *non-factual*.  
It is a hypothesis.  
It is a conjecture.  
  
Do you have *facts* I am unaware of which prove the hypothesis wrong?  
Is there a mailing list/BTTalk quote from Satoshi explaining another rationale for the choice of the money supply?  
  
You can argue that it wasn't designed *purposely* to end up that way.  
  
But, I personally don't believe it is a coincidence.  
  
When you split the 'units of account' in Bitcoin into a conventional format, three digits per comma(or period if you prefer), with a trailing two digits it conveniently comes quite close to what was estimated as global narrow money supply, or M1.  
  
Depending on where you get your data, and what years you are looking at, we are talking something like 25 trillion (in USD) in the M1.  
  


  
Converting that into an eight decimal format Gives you:  
  


  
Was it designed that way, or is this entirely a coincidence?  
  
Who knows - but, it is interesting, none-the-less.

No, assuming you don't set a channel up with another unconnected node, you need to set-up one channel, period.  
That one channel can then route to anyone else connected.  
Your funds aren't 'tied up' - they are free to transact with anyone connected to the lightning network.  
Of course, if you sell your car for a sizable amount of Bitcoin, it might make sense to take that larger amount and close out the channel and get it into cold storage.

@_date: 2018-01-14 11:05:51


  
No.  
The system is designed to automatically adjust the difficulty of mining based on the block time.  
If mining effort increased due to a higher reward (over time) as opposed to a reducing reward, the difficulty would simply increase to make the block time constant.  
  
So, it would have no direct effect on transaction fees.

I agree, but the foundation of your argument was that Walmart had decided to accept Bitcoin, suggesting it had gained general acceptance.  
  
I think it is much more likely that things proceed at a measured pace.  
  
With the recent futures markets from CBOE and CME and the glut of ETF proposals working their way to fruition exposure in the space will become an easy thing to accomplish reasonably soon.  
  
Once these 'assets' find themselves on the balance sheets of large and powerful institutions, do you think they will be banned without contention?  
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:35:46


  
Pedantic correction: Bitcoin takes a while to *confirm* and become irreversible, which is still extremely quick in comparison to legacy systems such as a credit card. Credit card transactions can usually be reversed for months. Bitcoin transactions are 'approved' simply by being seen by the vendor's node, which still happens almost immediately. For many super small transactions this should likely be enough verification to release, for instance, a coffee.
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:15:13
Are you being intentionally dense?  
You do realize you are purposely misconstruing my argument... right?    
  
Your post suggests that we should celebrate ' dropping back down under 100,000'!  
  
Let me simplify my argument for you.  
  
I can broadcast a **400,000** transactions that include a fee of 1 sat/b fee, at a cost of only 1 Bitcoin.  
Worse, these transactions will almost certainly be forgotten from the mempool before being confirmed making my cost **zero**.  
  
You are using the transaction count (instead of the **size in mb**).  
By your logic, there would now be **500,000** transactions in the mempool.  
  
It actually gets even worse.  
Not all transactions are created equally.  
A transaction is not a 1:1 transfer of Bitcoin.  
  
Instead, what is defined as 'a transaction' can be any number of inputs to any number of outputs.  
This means that the size of 'a transaction' and the number of individuals involved in that transaction can vary greatly.  
  
Can't you now see how using the transaction count in the mempool provides very little useful information about the state of the mempool and worse is easily manipulatable?  
  
The 'devil is in the details'.
@_date: 2018-01-12 08:01:26

Then they ignored the common advice to **always** cost average when you adjust your investments.

Yes.  
I do.  
  
The algorithm, which is essentially an asymmetric re-targetting algorthm, was first implemented in an altcoin called Digibyte.  
  
A good friend of mine wrote it, and I was consulted during it's creation.  
It was subsequently added to a plethora of other altcoins (in an attempt to defend against multipools) and given a variety of names.  
  
This algorithm failed, many many times, for years.  
Anyone with even a 101 level of understanding and experience in the space would have been thoroughly aware of the consequences of implementing such an algorithm.  
  
So, if a physicist has a complete misunderstanding or lack of understanding about  a fundamental concept such as the conservation of energy/momentum/mass - would that not quite thoroughly prove their incompetence in the field of psychology?  
  
Yes, it would.  
And, in the case of shitcash, yes, it does.

Sorry, that isn't how this works, friend.  
  
This branch of the comment thread is between you and I.  
By interjecting yourself into the thread, you inherit the portion of the previous thread that you are referencing.  
  
In this case, you've disagreed with my assertion that how coinbase manages their wallet is fair game and distinct from a private individual's wallet due to the fact that they are providing a service, part of which includes managing their user's transactions and directly involves their wallet.  
  
You must support your assertion that the fact that coinbase controls their own wallet somehow mitigates them from shaming. Not because you declared "coinbase controls their own wallet and that precludes them from shaming", but because you made the claim that coinbase controlling their own keys is identical to a user controlling their own keys/wallet in the context of my assertion that there was a fundamental difference between the two.  
  
Maybe you didn't *mean* to make that assertion, which is fine.  
But, by inserting yourself into the ongoing argument, that is exactly what you've done, imho.  
  
Of course, maybe it is simply better for us to agree to disagree :D

The 'shaming' you speak of is the public discovering that a major provider in the space is not as competitive or capable as previously believed.  
  
I think this is a natural and important outcome.  
  


  
No.  
You choose how to transact in your own wallet, and you pay the price for those choices.  
  
If you begin offering your wallet as a service to other individuals, competing with other online wallet options, and earning a fee in the process, then yes.  
  
Not for the **sake** of shaming, but for the sake of a transparent efficient market where users have the information available to them to make an educated purchasing decision.

Otherwise, you simply route to whatever merchant you want inside of lightning, and accept payment from others, inside of lightning.  
If you choose, you can pay the higher fees and do your transacting on chain, or you can choose to pay lower fees and stay within lightning - it is entirely up to you.

You aren't *wrong*, but I think you are drawing a false equivalency.  
  
When a shopkeeper accepts a credit card, that payment is at risk of being reversed for months. A 'confirmation' in Bitcoin, which can happen in as little as &lt; 10 minutes, is the equivalent of a credit card payment passing this multi-month threshold of reversal.  
  
So, Bitcoin has slower initial payment 'receipt', but much MUCH faster payment irreversibility. This makes it ideal for larger purchases where a reversal would be extremely painful.

There should be a signal activated block size increase to 2 MB, no more.  
  
That said, the stronger the **need** for transaction fee relief the faster lightning and other off-chain solutions will gain adoption.  
  
As we have seen with segwit, it is no small feat to push adoption even with fee pressure.

The energy required is not related directly to 'more' blocks.  
  
The energy expended by miners is directly proportional to how competitive the miners are to get the block reward.  
  
It is essentially an arms race, with energy costs going up as miners get more 'weapons' up and running.  
  
However, there is also a strong incentive to make the mining equipment more efficient, as the primary cost in mining is electricity.  
  
Therefore, the more efficient your miner, the more profit you turn per hash.

Another [user]( has suggested the math is wrong, I'm not qualified to say which is correct:  
$10 is 3.33% of $300 (the total value of the asset at realization)  
$10 of BTC into USD, the realized gains would be $10 - (3.3% of the initial $100 = $3.33) = $6.67

BCash used a difficulty re-target algorithm that had been a proven failure in multiple altcoin projects.

It is already in the reference client.  
Most people use the reference client as a headless terminal application - and segwit works just fine via terminal.  
For users using the GUI, it can also be utilized via the console.  
The graphical GUI is in testing and looks like it will come with the next update.

Apparently 'coinbase' operates in the Netherlands.  
It is an easy option.  
  
  
Though, you will find a lot of hate here for coinbase given their recent addition of bcoin.  
Hate that is probably well earned.  
  
localbitcoins.com is an alternative, where you do the trade for cash person-to-person.  
You should do the trade somewhere public and read the guides on localbitcoins if you choose to go that route.  
  
Otherwise, I expect there are other exchanges that operate in the Netherlands, a simple Google search will likely bring some up.  
  
You could then ask here about any specific exchange, and hopefully get some responses from local Bitcoin users who have experience with the exchange in question.

See, this is where you are mistaken.  
  
Ethereum was a scam from the moment of it's creation. Specifically, it was pre-pre-sold to insiders at a lower rate than the general public and insta-mined at launch.  
  
More importantly, the primary feature of a blockchain is the immutability of the ledger. Ethereum's ledger is mutable - thus destroying it's fundamental value proposition.

Every single person running a full Bitcoin node has to store every single transaction on the Bitcoin network.  
  
This means space is limited, in order to keep Bitcoin decentralized and censorship resistant.

Well, this would be for a system that is relatively small.  
You need to get a library to work with rpc.  
Which means you need to properly secure the system.  
  
If anything large at all will be stored, we would need to go a different route.  
In that case the easiest way would probably be to generate a ton of addresses offline cold and manually insert them into a database.

The rise of altcoins is unlikely to be directly related to the current transaction congestion.

In fairness, we can sustain some small block size increases, and in fact it is a planned scaling strategy.  
  
The problem is doing so without incurring the slippery slope of relying on block size increases for ALL of our scaling (which can't work as it's a linear solution to an exponential problem).

There is no % of confirmation, in the way that you are suggesting.  
Your wallet software must be trying to estimate the time to confirmation.  
  
If your transaction isn't included in a block, eventually the nodes in the network will discard it and forget it.  
  
Then, you can rebroadcast a new transaction with a different transaction fee.

Concerning altcoins, who said I don't support altcoins?  
Who suggested against the right to fork a FOSS project, certainly not me.  
  
You see, the problem here is your assumptions, not my 'religious zeal'.  
  
I simply reject your statist preaching of centralization.  
Not outright, as I am first and foremost a utilitarian, and would be the first to admit that common rules, procedures and governance have their place.  
  
However, in this case, it is in service of a known scam.  
There are plenty of good projects that **didn't** choose to scam their users, that there isn't good reason to hold my tongue against those that made the other choice.

What is the problem, there are a variety of ways to go about it.  
  
You run a full node, you generate addresses, you tie those addresses to user ids in your database, and you either ping the client to check for incoming transactions or you use a notify script to check for deposits.

You could do some leg work yourself and see if there are any security cameras in your area that might have caught their license plate or something - but, you would need to hurry, security cameras usually overwrite stored video after a time.  
  
Other than that, you could try and monitor accounts on the system, see if any of them log in - if they do, you could contact the service they logged into and possibly get the user's IP (the police would need to do this bit).

From a user's perspective, it is that simple.  
If you are unhappy with the speed of development I suggest you contribute to one of the open source projects implementing the lightning network, or hire development talent to contribute. These people are friends of the eco-system who donate their time to push this technology forward. They don't owe you, I, or anyone else anything. "We're all in this together" as it were.  
  
---  
  
Under the covers, it is quite a bit more complicated.  
Essentially, the IOU consists of bi-directional transactions in various states which give the receivers the ability to post that transaction to protect their position/coins.  
The magic of the system (hopefully) comes when you get a network of these bi-directional channels and implement routing logic between them.  
So, the concept is simple from an overview perspective, the implementation of it in such a way as to make it trustless and simple to use is considerably more difficult.

Now, now.  
It wasn't 'advice'.  
Just some shared wisdom.  
Fast moves don't give you time to think.  
Fast moves lock in the current price, instead of averaging over time.  
By averaging you don't get all of the gains of a positively moving position, but you also don't get all of the loses of a negatively moving position.  
It also prevents you from making excessive moves, in rapid succession, that can decimate a portfolio in a single day.  
  
At this point, you have already been moving fast into your positions, so it's hard telling what the correct move is.  
  
It could very well be to move quickly back into BTC and then slowly into select altcoins you think will do well to diversify your position (negative correlation with BTC).  
  
It is anyone's best guess at this point.

This isn't anything new.  
  
It isn't black and white.  
  
Rather, it is a spectrum.  
  
The idea you are trying to express is the concept of opportunity cost and marginal utility.  
  
Marginal utility, in that, each additional unit owned of cryptocurrency has a value to the owner, while competing with that marginal utility of hodling is the marginal utility of trading it for something else.  
  
There is an opportunity cost for any choice made.  
That includes hodling.  
The way in which we allocate our resources always balances on this edge, attempting to optimize for maximum utility.  
  
In this same way, any trade good, such as BTC, balances on the same 'edge'.  There is a utility of hodling (store of value, appreciation) and a utility of trading (the utility of the traded for good).

The whole point of the seed/key is to NOT touch an online system.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:39:56
If the wallet is encrypted, a keylogger is a vulnerability.  
  
Otherwise, a wallet file is simply a file, that can be pulled off of your system like any other file by malware.  
  
Further, drive encryption as a way of extorting crypto holders isn't unheard of.  
  
The normal solution is to manage a luke-warm wallet.  
Where the wallet is kept on an offline system, often a live *nix system without persistence, such as Tails OS.  
Transactions are then signed on the offline system and moved over to an online system to be broadcasted.

No - it just doesn't tell the entire story.  
  
First of all, it lumps all transactions, including those which include a ridiculously low fee, into one pile, and thus the data is useless.  
  
More importantly, many seem to misunderstand the transaction process in Bitcoin.  
When a transaction is seen by the network, that is the equivalent of the approval a vendor gets when you swipe your credit card.  
The network has verified that the account has the funds necessary to cover the transaction and that it is a valid transaction.  
This happens instantly, even faster than conventional payment systems.  
  
When a transaction attains a 'confirmation', this is roughly equivalent in other payment systems to when a transaction becomes irreversible. This process for conventional payment processors can take many months. Again, Bitcoin is vastly superior, and faster, than those systems.

It isn't about the absolute size in the short term.  
When we are talking about the long term, it is about the rate of increase.  
  
I personally don't see a major problem with 2 MB blocks, *maybe* even a smidge larger.  
The only problem is that it sets a precedent and means there will be no incentive to create other solutions (other solutions which are required, as block size alone can't solve the problem).

Forgive me, but your history seems quite.... indicative of less than honest inquiry.  
  
I'll bite, however.  
You are taking the statement out of context.  
He was simply suggesting an interim way to avoid excessive transactions.  
  
He didn't handle it well, given the history on the topic.  
The suggestion with this clip, as it's being linked out on the interwebs, is that this is some kind of blockstream 'solution'.  
It was just an offhand tidbit explaining how some are avoiding the need for transactions.  
  
A great example of this is GDAX and coinbase - last I checked you could move over your balance without sending an on chain transaction.

The public key is hashed with sha256 and ripe160 I believe.   
The hash is then what you see as the 'address'.  
  
This provides an additional line of defense against possible future vulnerabilities.  
  
When you spend from that address you must reveal the public key underneath those hashes, removing that additional line of defense.  
  
As others have said, as long as you only SPEND once, you are fine.

Unless I am mistaken, the block that included that overflow transaction was orphaned.  
  
Current software will not accept such a transaction.

Well, the idea is that because you sold and went long, or bought and went short at the same time, you can realize the difference between the market immediately, as regardless if it goes up or down, the trade is a wash (minus fees).  
  
Edit:  
Example, if you go short and buy at the same time.  
If Bitcoin price goes up, you lose on your short position but simultaneously gain on the BTC you purchased.  
If Bitcoin price goes down, you lose on your BTC purchase but gain the same amount on your short position.  
So, basically, you are able to realize the spread between the two markets as profit immediately, as the positions cancel each other out.

One of the main problems in this area is a misunderstanding of nomenclature.  
  
In the conventional payments industry transactions don't follow the same process.  
  
When a merchant swipes your credit card, that is the equivalent in Bitcoin of your transaction being sent out to the network. It has been approved by the network as a valid transaction.  
  
It can be many months in the conventional payment system until a payment is unable to be reversed. A confirmation in Bitcoin is equivalent to an irreversible transaction.  
  
The Bitcoin network processes transactions FASTER than the conventional payment system.

ETH has it's own scaling problems; it scales worse than Bitcoin last I had heard.

Even that is unimportant.  
As the only way to identify spam transactions from real transactions is to look at the fee.  
  
Currently, over HALF of the transactions pending are under 30 sat/byte in fee.  
  
Currently, much more than 2/3rds of pending transactions by size(MB) are under 30 sats/byte.  
  
For reference, that is about a dollar for an average transaction.  
  
Further, a full half, by size, are less than 10 sats/byte.  
This is roughly 25-30 cents per transaction.  
  
So, half of all pending transactions, by size, have a fee included of less than 30 cents.

The space/market as whole is scaling just fine, and that scaling will include altcoins.  
  
There isn't a project/coin that has solved scaling alone yet.  
There are trade-offs.  
  
ETH's chain is something like 300gb and growing rapidly, unsustainably. Further, it was pre-pre-sold to insiders.    
  
XRP is a scamcoin initially 80% distributed to insiders and released closed-source.  
  
Bcash provides no benefit not already provided by multiple altcoin networks with longer histories and more dependable developers. Further, the development team of bcash has proven to be unreliable given the diff-algo they implemented, which had previously failed in multiple altcoin networks, and resulted in considerable additional inflation.  
  
The tangle is interesting, but is still centralized, last I had checked.

Welcome back :)  
  
I recommend not putting more than you can afford to lose.  
  
However, I do not make that recommendation to prevent loss.  
  
I make that recommendation because once you've set it in your mind that you are playing with house money, it is easier to have the fortitude to move slowly and methodically, and HODL through the temporary moves.  
  
So, cost-average so that you always have time to think through your moves, and only invest what you can truly afford to lose, so that you have the strength to HODL through daily volatility.

If you control the private key/seed phrase, that the address which **currently** holds funds is generated from, then yes, you are correct.  
  
Be careful that the funds are actually at the address you think they are, and not sitting at a change address.  
  
If you are using a seed phrase and Electrum, then ignore the above advice, as change addresses will also be included/generated from the same seed phrase.

Bitcoin is quite unique, you simply are not grasping what is actually important.  
  
You see, currency is a confidence game.  
Despite the technology being trustless, in order for a currency to have value it must be 'trusted'.  
  
The developers working on Bitcoin have proven, through multiple systemic issues (Mt.Gox) that the chain is the final word on transactions.  
  
This may seem unimportant, but it is actually **the** most important thing.  
Chain and parameter sanctity is the basis of value in the Bitcoin network.  
  
We can compare this approach to, for instance, ETH where there is no sanctity of the chain.  
At any given moment in time, there can be no confidence that a transaction on chain is immutable.

* If you were using a private wallet, send it with a smaller fee and wait a bit longer, until the rich folks transactions get cleared.

Bitcoin's value propositions are monetary (logarithmic, low, time-bounded, inflation), security (extreme work-based transaction confirmation), and decentralization (no delegations, no ring signatures, only competitive work).  
  
These value propositions are needed, and indeed not compatible with some of the value propositions of other networks.  
  
The space is much wider than folks believe at the moment.  
  
Bitcoin is going nowhere.

Raising the block size is needed; and most of the core devs agree.  
  
If you solve this problem with a linear scaling solution, like the block size increase, without having other strategies in place, you start yourself down a very slippery slope.  
  
You see, while a small increase can be sustained without totally destroying decentralization, very large changes would change the nature of Bitcoin as a decentralized currency.  
  
Unfortunately, the easy solution is to just increase the block size. Again, and again, and again.  
  
But, if you look at the numbers, this can't get us where we need to go, without forcing every single full node into a data center, where they are easy to regulate.  
  
---  
  
This is a careful balancing act.  
  
The arguments you have heard on the other side can be well meaning, but they are elephants thrashing about in the china shop.  
  
You see, if there is not some congestion, there is no incentive or drive for the rapid development of solutions that can actually scale Bitcoin to the global scale it needs to achieve.  
  
The careful solution arrived at?  
  
We prepare, carefully and methodically, to increase the block size in the near future, while simultaneously letting the market do what it is great at doing: meeting needs.  
  
Lightning is coming along nicely.  
If it works as expected, and it is combined with some marginal increase in block size, it has the capability of getting us a long way along the path we need to go.

Hardware wallets can be an easy solution.  
  
Alternatively, you can run Tails OS live, via USB stick, on an offline computer.  
Tails OS doesn't have persistence (saving of files) unless you specifically enable/configure it.  
Further, it comes with Electrum built-in to the distro.  
Then, you can sign transactions in Tails OS, and broadcast them on a different, online system.  
  
**WARNING:**  
Make sure you write down your seed words.  
Tails OS will NOT save your wallet if you restart.

It is an open source specification with multiple open source implementations being worked on.  
  
It essentially involves trading bidirectional 'IOUs' in such a way as that at any time, if one party is dishonest, either party can go back to the chain to settle the balance trustlessly.  
  
The more magical part comes when you have a network of these arrangements, allowing you to route through the network for your payments without touching the chain itself.

You see, cryptocurrencies are extremely liquid between networks.

The transaction throughput of cryptocurrency has been expanding at a break-neck speed.  
  
More importantly, the lag between networks has reduced as solutions such as shapeshift and soon cross chain transactions emerge.

What you fail understand, I think, is that all currency is a confidence game.  
  
It is about trust.  
  
I am not aware of a single unit of account in common usage that has intrinsic value.  
  
The question isn't if you can calculate a blue book value to justify the current price.  
  
The question is if there is reason to have faith in *this* particular confidence game over the other competing unit of account confidence games.  
  
I think one could argue there is; specifically, a reason to trust from historical anecdotes that the development team and community will hold strong the sanctity of the ledger and the sanctity of the constants/parameters of the network.  
  
When you get into Bitcoin there is an assumption (which i believe is solid for the foreseeable future) that the core parameters are unchanging.  
  
This is something that you *can't* say about conventional units of account/currencies.  
  
As volatile as Bitcoin is, it is significantly more stable in terms of the fundamentals of the currency.

Depends on what you consider an 'average hard drive'.  
  
Many consumer laptops now days ship with only something like a 128gb SSD.  
  
If you consider that 'average' then yes, we have a problem.  
  
This is why there has been so much resistance to increasing the block size.  
  
Further, the larger the chain grows, the longer the initial sync will take, and the more bandwidth the network will have to use to on board new nodes.  
  
Of course, anyone who bothers to run a full node before opening their mouth already knows this :D

1. Privacy, moving the outputs on the secondary chain can expose your privacy if the outputs are connected, or a party of the transaction is ultimately de-anonymized.

A very limited increase is likely not a bad idea.  
Significant increase would make what is already a painful initial sync, even more painful.  
  


  
A cap is admittedly a poor way to force a fee market.  
I don't think many of the core devs would argue that point, either.  
  
There are a variety of ideas, such as a dynamic block size, that have been posted to different development forums. None have passed muster, been proven to be safe, and been properly implemented to my knowledge.   
  
My personal favorite was a regime where miners were forced to not receive some of the block reward, in a progressive manner, in order to increase the block size. The end result is a system where you still have a fee market but the block size can expand to never have a hard cap. Basically, any transaction with a high enough fee to offset the loss in mining revenue will always be included in the next block. However, this idea was dead on arrival - likely because it is in some ways just another magic constant (the curve over which that trade off occurs) and it is anathema to change the emission rate.  
  
Again, I am not aware of a politically feasible solution that properly takes into consideration the increasingly onerous and expensive task of syncing a full node, the security implications of spam/bloat, and the rigorous code standards we should expect in Bitcoin.  
  
Feel free to take a stab on the development mailing list or other venues.

However, the parties who enjoy/suffer those pros and cons are not the same.

Don't have the code in front of me, but I believe there a couple of ways the network would defend against such an attack.  
  
First, the transaction would not be broadcast, as it would fail to validate.  
  
Second, I believe nodes would apply a 'misbehaving' score to nodes broadcasting the transaction, which would eventually cause other nodes to ban the offending node. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:05:07

It would make it impossible for users to run a full verifying node.

They are wrong.

You've tipped your hand with you choice of words alone.  
The concept isn't complicated.  
  
Block space is limited resource.  
There is more demand for transaction space than there is space available for use.  
  
The cost of using block space is an externality which is paid for by a different subset of users than those which benefit from it's use.  
  
This is a mis-attribution of costs (the true problem here).  
The correct way to fix this problem is to allocate the costs of storage to those who benefit from that storage.  
  
  
Fees attempt to allocate the costs of storage the party benefiting from that storage.  
Further, they make expensive bloat/spam from malicious actors.  
  
Without fees the chain could be bloated to such an extent as to literally kill Bitcoin (one of the *very* few ways in which it **CAN** actually be killed).  
So, you can argue for a better way to calculate the fees, a better way to allocate the block space, and a exactly what amount of bloat/size of the chain is acceptable for decentralization.  
  
But, arguing against fees in general is non-sensical.  
  
Accepting that block space is a limited resource, how do you propose 'winners' and 'losers' are decided?  
Without a fee market to pick which transaction get included, who gets included in a block?  
  
Do we draw straws?

Short answer:  
  
Major changes are submitted as 'BIP's.  
An implementation is written into code and submitted as a pull.  
The community discusses and tests the pull.  
If it has a preponderance of support and agreement it gets merged into the next release.

If you have enough funds, I would avoid sweeping and instead send outputs individually to preserve privacy.  
  
Otherwise all of your outputs will be connected together.  
  
That said, it can get quite expensive right now with fees to do them individually; so unless it is a large sum of bitcoin, it might be more cost effective to just sweep them, and take the privacy hit.  
  
Up to you, in the end.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:02:45
  
  
These charts suggest that transactions with 200-300sat per kb are clearing currently.  
  
An average transaction is something like 200-250kb.  
  
This puts the fee per transaction at something like ~0.00056250.  
  
Or, roughly, ~$9.60 for reasonably quick confirmation.

To make a short bet, it must be matched with someone making a long bet.  
If short bets outsize/number the long bets, the spot on the market will go down, swallowing offers lower in price to be filled.  
This creates an arbitrage opportunity, for individuals to create long positions at this reduced price while simultaneously SELLING actual Bitcoin to cover the position.  
  
Just my take on it. (Not a margin or futures trader).

The count is entirely unimportant.  
You are misleading people.

So, 80% of all pending transactions paid less than $1.50 in fees.

No, shapeshift is a centralized service and still has quite a bit of friction.  
  
The argument is that the friction of converting between chains/altcoins/cryptos is going down over time.  
  
There are already thousands of altcoin networks, each of which can sustain a varying degree of transaction throughput.  
  
Together, they can already do many thousands of transactions a second and as the friction of conversion approaches zero the throughput and scaling problem also begins resolving.

Coinbase does their own thing, and often over pays by quite a lot.  
  
In terms of the network/mempool, it has been clearing out slowly for a bit now.

Further, in terms of Coinbase, a common strategy seems to be moving the funds to GDAX (free) and withdrawing from their for less.

I'm no expert, but I would argue that despite this they can indeed have an affect on BTC price.  
  
A large quantity of short orders would swallow existing long orders and move the futures price/market downward.  
  
This would create an arbitrage opportunity to create a long position while simultaneously selling actual Bitcoin.  
  
Holding both positions simultaneously would allow the trader to arbitrage and realize the difference between the markets without exposure to either.  
  
So, theoretically, a large amount of shorting in the futures market could cause selling in the Bitcoin market in order for traders to realize arbitrage opportunities between the two.

First, I'm not an accountant or lawyer, so this isn't 'advice'.  
  
It is treated as property in terms of taxation.  
So, it would be the equivalent of accepting real estate.  
  
I expect you could get away with claiming the initial cost basis as income.  
  
Any appreciation from the time you receive it, to the time you sell it, I would expect you would handle as capital gains.  
  
Short-term capital gains are taxes at a higher rate than long-term (greater than 2 years).  
  
If you intend to sell some immediately, I would set up an account on an exchange now, so you can get verified (it can take a little bit of time).

This article a cobble-together of falsehoods and ignorance.  
  


  
Bullshit. Transactions on conventional payment systems can be reversed for literally months. Alternatively, Bitcoin is confirmed, in a trustless manner, in less than an hour.  
  


  
Funny. The volatility argument. I will take an asset that is volatile and has a year to year record of appreciation over an asset that has reliably lost it's value, year after year, forever.  
  


  
Not a particularly enlightened argument. The scaling argument stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of the space. Crypto scaled years and years ago. Liquidity between crypto currencies is high, and thousands of networks exist.  
  


  
Seriously? Half the world is held captive in monetary systems experiencing crippling inflation. Argue 'inclusion' to those who use a wheelbarrow to buy lunch. Argue 'inclusion' to those who quite literally don't have access to banking.

Individuals found it worthwhile to run a node prior to Bitcoin having any 'price' at all. Not ap roblem.  
  


  
The number of nodes has virtually no impact on transaction times. Even with a single miner, using their CPU (assuming a reasonable period of time to reduce to that point and thus adjust the difficulty) can easily create blocks at the same rate they are currently created and thus transaction times would remain the same.  
  


  
This is a reasonable point - and, precisely why Bitcoin has been so conservative in terms of increasing the block size.

Not true.  
In fact, the fewer the nodes, the higher the throughput.  
Transactions are propagated in the network via what is essentially a whisper network.  
The fewer nodes in that network, the faster the transaction reaches a majority of the nodes.  
Indeed, the transaction really only needs to reach ONE node - the next node to find/mine a block.

In terms of what it 'means':  
Each bar is a period of time.  
The filled in portion of the bar represents the open and closing prices, from the start of the period of time.  
If the bar is red, that means the opening price was higher than the closing price.  
If the bar is green, that means the opening price was lower than the closing price.  
The line represents the highest and lowest price that was traded (a buy/sell executed) during the period.

As others have mentioned, privacy is one of the concerns.  
  
An important topic I haven't seen covered yet: hash-blinding.  
  
The problem with reusing an address, from a security standpoint, is related to SENDING from that address multiple times, not from receiving multiple times.  
  
The address you see when sending is not the public key, it is the public key wrapped in hash functions. This gives it a great deal of additional security. Even if an alien quantum computer was reversed engineered tomorrow, the hash function would need to be reversed BEFORE and in addition to attempting to break the asymmetric curve to get the private key.  
  
When you send, you reveal the public key so that it can be checked against your signature for validity.

You are drawing the analogy incorrectly.  
First of all, zero confirmation transactions are absolutely fine for small transactions.  
  
Yes, there is some risk that the transaction will be 'reversed'. That risk can either be defrayed through pricing or by socializing the cost and using a 'vendor' to provide the POS solution, who is of course compensated for the risk via a percentage fee. This is absolutely no different than conventional POS.  
  
Reversal is a very real and ever present problem with conventional payment systems. In fact, transactions can be reversed for MONTHS in the conventional system, making zero confirmation Bitcoin transactions quicker and more secure than the conventional system (though a bit different, tradeoffs). There is no reason whatsoever to 'reinvent the wheel'.

Yes - AND no, in my opinion.  
  
Cash reduces consumer protection as well. However, when you wrap it in third parties those disadvantages can be ameliorated. Bitcoin is no different. However, the difference is that with Bitcoin there are also clever ways to accomplish many of those things without trust.  
  
Bitcoin/crypto isn't a magic bullet. However, suggesting that all of the benefits we enjoy with the modern financial system can't be adjusted or even applied directly to the Bitcoin ecosystem is just plain wrong.  
  
Have risk for point-of-sale transactions? Get your point-of-sale system through a provider which charges a fee and thus can afford to accept zero or low confirmation transactions (cancelling merchants that have a pattern of reversals, just as they do with debit/credit card POS at the moment).  
  
My disagreement isn't with the 'fact' that there is exposure in point-of-sale. My disagreement is that many act as though all of the traditional methods we use to defray those costs/exposure somehow don't apply.  
  
Try processing credit/debit transactions without a third-party. I mean theoretically you could write down the card numbers and take signatures and then file a claim with VISA/Mastercard for the funds. But, you don't, do you? No, you pay a POS vendor to process the transaction, a third-party.  
  
Bitcoin is no different.  
  
Bitcoin is simply digital cash, trustless (with the associated risks) just like cash.  
  
I hand you some cash.  
I can punch you in the face and take my cash back.  
I have just reversed the transaction.  
However, if I give you ten minutes to leave the area, you now have a confirmation of that transaction, as it is MUCH more difficult for me to reverse that transaction.  
  
For some reason, it seems, to me, that some people (not necessarily you) have an inability to draw proper analogies when it comes to Bitcoin. They see it as some magical dragon that the world has hitherto never seen.  
  
It is, in a way. But, it also has very similar analogues to things we already understand very clearly.

Your argument rests on the concept that unaccountable systems, such as Bitcoin or cash, are less preferable than an 'accountable' system, such as a publicly traded company.  
  
In order for this 'accountability' to exist, it necessarily implies that some action can be taken.

A bit of expanation to go along with nullc's [response](  
  
The Bitcoin blockchain, and associated Proof-of-work mechanism, allows nodes that do not trust each other to agree on what the 'state' of the network/system is at any given point in time.  
  
This protection does not extend to pending transactions in the mempool, which are distributed via a sort of whisper protocol. Each node can have a different set of transactions in their mempool.  
  
Given the above, there is no way to independently verify, at any given point in time (such as when an empty block is created), what the 'state' of the mempool is, nor is there even any notion of a global network 'state' for the mempool at all.  
  
In a consensus system, when two nodes disagree on what is 'allowed' this would result in some nodes accepting the zero transaction block and others rejecting it. Resulting in a fork.
  
Further, the mempool is not a static organism. It is simply a data structure that hold transactions. A sync'ing node has no notion of which transactions were in the mempool when a past block was created. This would make historical sync'ing of a new node impossible as the 'state' of the mempool (empty or not) is undefined for instants in the past.  
  
Hope that is accurate and helpful.
@_date: 2017-08-01 09:11:09
It is complicated.  
  
Once a chain 'forks' the transaction history is different.  
  
So, though the private key is indeed the same, it can be used to create two separate transactions, one in each chain, 'spending' the coins to different addresses.  
  
You should likely consider making those transactions to DIFFERENT addresses YOU control at first and then verifying that the transactions exist in non-compatible blocks on each respective chain.

This is bullshit.  
Anyone who has had their own Point-of-sale terminal in the conventional banking system is well aware of the rate of clawbacks/reversals.  
Zero confirmation Bitcoin transactions are just as fast, and though there is no data I would argue the chance of a clawback is lower.  
You could argue that it is somewhat slower than tap-to-pay (qr code scanning) but that also comes with the advantage that the purchaser gets to SEE the transaction being approved.  
  
It is different, but suggesting that Bitcoin users need to wait until two or three confirmations (which is final irreversible settlement, and doesn't occur in the conventional system for months) is hogwash.

I have been involved in crypto for quite some time and I have yet to hear a story about someone accepting a zero confirmation transaction and then getting screwed.

And, you can.  
You do the exact SAME thing that point-of-sale providers do.  
You allow merchants to accept zero confirmation transactions for sales under a certain dollar amount.  
A small percentage of these result in problems with payment.  
You include this cost with the fee you charge the merchant for the service.  
Merchants which have a reputation of zero confirmation problems have their contract revoked, and you stop servicing them (the same thing PoS providers do now, with chargebacks).  
  
The problem here is that some people with a poor understanding of how Bitcoin works made the false equivalency between Bitcoin confirmation and conventional transactions.  
  
You actually have MORE security, at every time scale and step, with Bitcoin than the conventional system.

Bullshit.  
The equivalent of a 'tap to pay' point of sale transaction is a ZERO CONFIRMATION Bitcoin transaction, NOT a confirmed transaction.  
  
A confirmed transaction is IRREVERSIBLE, which is equivalent to final settlement in the conventional system, which takes months.  
  
A zero confirmation transaction almost always gets confirmed, and though there is no data by virtue of how the system works, there is no reason to assume that the rate of 'reversal' of zero confirmation Bitcoin transactions is higher than what is an abysmal rate in the conventional system.

Don't fall for this garbage.  
Lightning is really interesting tech for a variety of reasons, but you don't even need to resort to lightning to get similar (and I would argue better) features.  
  
'Tap to pay' services can be clawed back from vendors for months and are no more secure than a 0 confirmation transaction.  
  
In fact, though it's impossible to know, I expect the rate at which 0 confirmation Bitcoin transactions have been 'seen' by the receiver and then subsequently reversed is almost certainly LOWER than the reversal/clawback rate of merchant Point-of-sale terminals.

Ummmmmm.......  
Contrary to what you've been told, credit card transfers don't clear and become irreversible instantly.....  
It can take months for a credit card transaction to clear completely to where it can't be reversed.  
Confirmation in Bitcoin is similar to reversibility.  
  
They are friends.  
It is a gift.  
They aren't worried about you double-spending their gift, lol.  
  
Send with a very very low fee, just like you normally would.  
They will see it pop up in their wallet right when you send it.  
By the time they want to spend it, it will be confirmed.

Speaking specifically of the ISP market.  Though, if you follow Adam Smith's teachings, there is basically no market that is properly set up to be 'free' in U.S.  
  
Again, the devil is in the details.  
Gutting one of the last remaining consumer/user protections BEFORE gutting the monopolistic protections is naive, imho.  
  
My previous suggestion stands.  
Show me a robust free market of ISPs that can properly self-regulate via competition and I will whole-heartedly support stripping away regulations that impede the freedom of all parties involved.  
  
Until then, projects like Bitcoin could literally be killed in their crib without these protections - a poverty we can't afford to risk during this nascent period of the movement towards decentralization also known as the internet.

Sorry to be prickly, pedantic, and insistent.  
However, it matters.  
  
One could easily follow with a question like:  
  


  
The point of my response is to clarify that Bitcoin is a tool.  
More importantly, like any other tool (including the U.S. Dollar), it can be used for both good and evil.  
  
The tool itself, in this case Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, bares absolutely no culpability, intent, etc.  
  
Therefore, it is irresponsible and misleading to include it as a material part of the question.  
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:20:15
A serious answer.  
  
You paid ~1.75% in fees; not unreasonable.  
  
Further, a confirmed transaction in the Bitcoin network != swiping a card at a point-of-sale.  
  
Those payments don't become irreversible for months.  
You got an irreversible transaction, recorded globally, without having to ask permission, for a smidge under a 2% fee in less than half of a day.  
  
You did well.
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:32:38
The situation is fucked.  
  
It is fucked both fundamentally due to the technology we use to access the internet (over-land wiring) and in terms of regulations (which protect a oligarchy of providers).  
  
In a perfect idealistic world the internet would be topographically a mesh based network transported via voluntary over-the-air technology and made canonical with technologies such as those underlying Bitcoin.  
  
Alas, we don't live in that world.  
We live in a world where the wires that provide the internet to your house are proprietary and private.  
This means that competition doesn't exist.  
  
The people that own those wires want to be able to decide what things, and how fast, it is you are allowed to get data over those wires.  
  
Others here will argue 'state bad, moAr free market'.  
  
They seem to be either entirely unaware of the fundamental prerequisites of a free market laid out in Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations, or naive in their assumptions concerning the result, or timeframe, of indiscriminately eliminating user protections prior to fixing the core problem - the market is an entrenched non-competitive oligarchy with strong regulatory capture.
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:16:18
The story is deeper than that.  
  
On a first world income, true.  
Hard drives are quite inexpensive.  
Of course, this does not take into account the many individuals (where Bitcoin has real utility and opportunity) who do not have access to that kind of money.  
  
It is important to remember, borrowing complexity jargon, this is an O(n) proposition. Each byte must be stored on each node. At the present that may only be a few thousands nodes; however, if Bitcoin had mass adoption we would hope that this number increases to the millions (or ideally, billions).  
  
That would suggest that every single byte must be stored independently on millions or billions of hard drives.  
  
More importantly, there are bandwidth costs and an increasing barrier to entry. It can already take hours or more to get a full node sync'd.

This isn't true.  
Pull a figure on the number of transactions per day and then pull a figure on estimated users in the space.  
It is unlikely that they will argue all of those transactions are purely speculation - as there is no need to create a transaction to trade, or between trades.  
  


  
Possibly.  
Or, it will explode - as evidenced by growing google search trends in places which have current monetary crisis.

A reasoned opinion.  
I think it misses the point, however.  
  
Crypto isn't *anything* that existed prior.  
It is it's own asset class.  
  
I think your analysis is quite accurate in that Bitcoin is a confidence game.  
The arguments equating energy usage to intrinsic vaue are misguided in my personal opinion.  
The part that you miss, I think, is that the Bitcoin network  has a limited supply of fundamental utility.  
  
The 'bet', then, is that this limited utility has a value.  
By owning Bitcoin, you are purchasing the right to utilize that utility.  
  
Consider two cities.  
They are connected by a trail through the woods and a river.  
The river is a much more efficient means of transport between the two cities.  
However, it is a narrow river with a limited throughput.  
Owning Bitcoin would thus be a toll paid in order to utilize the efficiency of the river to traverse between the two cities.  
  
Just a bit of disjointed food for thought.

Well, the expectation would be that it would be priced in by the market - essentially creating no new wealth/value.  
  
However, in this space things are more complicated.  
One must have Bitcoin prior to the fork in order to receive coins after the fork.  This is causing capital from the alt markets and elsewhere to flood the Bitcoin market.  This, in turn, makes it very difficult to interpret what exactly is, and is not, the market pricing in the fork (though I suppose the capital inflow IS pricing it in, after a fashion).  
  
TL;DR:  
Grab a hold of something; we're in uncharted territory.

That is a fair argument to make, and despite my disagreement I would grant you that we don't know the answer to that yet.

The trick is to take on as little risk(fear) as possible and simultaneously expose yourself to as much opportunity as possible.

Assuming the ISP market was a properly functioning non-monopolistic market, and reasonable consumer information rules were in place, competition might serve as well - but, alas, that is not the present world we live in.  
  
Let us not unilaterally disarm.

Bitcoin is very similar to cash.  
If you leave it on a park bench - there is no one to 'appeal' to for reimbursement or help.  
  
Specifically concerning localbitcoins:  
  
Secure your account as an attacker with access to your account could intercept your coins.  
  
Look for an in person cash trade, as each different type of trade has it's own risks.  
  
Meet in a public place where a physical robbery is unlikely.  
  
Make sure the Bitcoin has a confirm on chain BEFORE you hand over the cash.

The infrastructure required to maintain these networks is partially built on public land and duplicating that infrastructure is not only unnecessarily costly, it's unsightly and in many cases simply not possible.

Go sync a full node yourself, before you accuse someone who has run full nodes on a few dozen different networks and worked with the code on a half dozen others.  
  
The fact is that chain space is a limited resource.  
Not because of some constant in the code, but because storage space, network bandwidth, and computation resources are limited.  
  
You can freely 'register' transactions on Bitcoin now, and will be able to forever into the future.  
Of course, you must compete with others who wish to utilize that same limited resource.  
  
A constant 'cap' is likely *not* the best implementation to accomplish these goals, but there isn't social support for any of the other solutions, such as a consensus required progressive fee modulated by block size, enforced by a reduction in the block reward.  
  
So, alas, we are stuck with a cap.  
Removing the cap doesn't solve the problem, it pushes it back temporarily while simultaneously making it half as expensive to bloat the chain with bytes that must be stored, indefinitely into the future, by every single node that will ever exist, for all time.  
  
The problem with the bcash trolls isn't what they believe, it's what they don't understand about how the system functions. They argue for 'on chain' transactions as opposed to second layer solutions while simultaneously making changes to the protocol that make it more difficult to verify your own chain, and thus those same transactions they want 'on chain' so badly.  
  
It is nonsensical doublespeak.

Spam in a block that is not full is virtually free, as there is no fee competition. For instance, the Bitcoin network enjoyed nearly free transactions for years while blocks remained not consistently full.  
  
So, yes, it would take more spam.  
However, that spam need not be more expensive.  
  
The problem with this spam is not ONLY that is makes confirmation difficult and expensive NOW.  
The more important consideration is the 'weight' and size these transactions add to the total chain size. This is data that must be stored forever - a time frame us humans have trouble truly understanding.

The type, and quantity, of data kept on today's electronic devices far surpasses the types of 'documents' kept historically. More importantly, much of that data is stored automatically or without direct interaction from the user.  
  
More importantly, in the very near future we will begin to see new types of man-machine interfaces. Interfaces that have a much more direct connection, and much higher bandwidth of information exchange. It would be wise for us to get out ahead of these types of issues before they become extremely serious vulnerabilities to our freedom. It is not out of the realm of possibility, in the near-ish future, for our devices to contain imprints of our very memories and thoughts. Nothing will be more important to privacy and freedom than keeping that data secure and private.

For shits and giggles, make sure you run the numbers on older miners.  
  
The interesting dynamic that I think is underappreciated when I see these types of solar panel ideas is that the miner never(~) goes absolutely obsolete - theoretically, at least.  
  
Older miners can often be picked up for a **drastic** discount, as purchasing electricity to run them is more expensive than the rate at which they can mine, making them net negative investments for individuals purchasing electricity from the grid.

What you fail to realize (same as most of the other bcash supporters) is that transaction fees *need* to be high.  
  
Chain bloat can be deadly for a chain (take a look at the 1 minute block chains that have been running for a few years) in a very real existential way.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:01:01
A 'normal' transaction does not have 'several' inputs and outputs.  
  
Also, expecting to be first in line to get your transaction confirmed, at the cost of pennies, on a global network which is currently under attack, when even current bank cards don't 'confirm' and become irreversible for weeks or months is *bullshit*.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:40:54
Technically, assuming the electricity is free (already pre-paid for via purchase of the solar equipment) there would be no point at which the miner would become obsolete.  
  
The exception would be if you were in a position to sell the electricity back to the grid - at which point the miner wouldn't be obsolete, just less economical.
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:57:04
It actually proves just the opposite.  
Everything is a trade off.  
  
The Bitcoin network is currently under a spam attack; which, is made worse because of the EDA difficulty adjustment of BCH.  
  
There are two ways to deal with the spam attack.  
If you make bigger blocks the transactions fees go down, making the bloat/spam cheaper to execute. It lessens the impact of the attack NOW, but greatly extends the impact of the attack forever. Every single byte stored on the chain today, must be stored on the chain, by every single full node, FOREVER.  
  
Alternatively, you keep the blocks small, the fee market automatically adjusts to make the attack more expensive for the attacker. The impact NOW is worse, with slower transactions times during the attack. However, the impact of the attack is greatly reduced, over the long term. Further, it becomes increasingly expensive to sustain the attack, as the fee market will automatically adjust to shed off the attack.  
  
TL;DR  
What you are witnessing is a resilient system shrugging off a serious and expensive attack. You are seeing a purposeful trade-off, inconvenience now in the service of preventing the chain from being irreparably bloated forever.

The problem is that during times of congestion spam competes in the same fee market as the average user.  
  
This means that cheap transactions for you necessarily means cheap transactions for the spammer.  
  
This, in turn, means the spam will last LONGER and bloat the chain MORE as it is less expensive to execute the attack.

You take these 'structural issues' as 'given' due to them being repeated ad nauseum by individuals who are selling you their bag.  
  
In actuality, they don't really exist.  
  
The energy 'problem' is both overblown (the current system burns much more energy when all of the brick-and-mortar parts are included) and important. Proof-of-stake inevitably results in centralized authority, delegated solutions are centralized from the beginning, etc.  
  
The capacity 'problem' will exist in every digital system unless it is centralized. Further, there are already solutions in the works.  
  
The speed 'problem' in non-existent. It is a trade-off, like everything else. 'Solving' the speed problem on chain results in a larger 'capacity' problem. More importantly, this problem has already been solved by the current system. Current payments processors already very efficiently handle unreliable transactions and fraud, and this will be handled in Bitcoin in a similar fashion. So, essentially, the vast majority of transactions can already be accepted with zero confirmations, making them just as fast or faster than the conventional system.

Garbage.  
  
A. Bitcoin is a public service. If someone etches a link to CP into all the public roadways in a city, should we abandon the city?  
  
B. Bitcoin nodes are providing a service. Worst case scenario: nodes receive a report of this data existing on their storage service, and they implement a rather simple pruning and stop serving that block or transaction. The missing data could easily be pre-validated and provided, sans the offending data, with the client itself as a sort of checkpoint block.
@_date: 2018-03-23 01:21:20
I believe you are the one confused.  
  
This is essentially stenography.  
  
Bitcoin users who possess the blockchain are doing so for the specific purpose of the transaction it contains. The software which manages that chain does not have the capability to view that data.
  
Using stenography, one could quite easily encode child pornography into the picture of a cat. The person who possesses the picture of the cat does not have the capability of viewing the CP in that cat picture, and only sees a cat.  
  
There is very little difference between these two situations. Normal block chain software does not decode or allow the viewing of this offending data, just as normal image viewing software does not decode or allow the viewing of the offending data in the cat image.
   
In fact, the data doesn't even exist without additional data to decode it.  
   
Is it the additional data, which pulls pixels from the 'original' data to decode the image illegal? Is the cat image illegal? Is the image viewing software illegal? Is the internet, for transmitting the data illegal?  
  
These questions sound like ridiculous arguments, but they aren't.  
Any random number generator, paired with additional data to decode the proper bits, can generate ANY image or data whatsoever. One could take the initial video of a computer game, and 'decode' it into ANY CP image in existence. So, is the video illegal, when it exists in it's format as intended? Or, is the additional data decoding the pixels into CP illegal? Both?  
  
Again, the data on the Bitcoin block chain requires additional data to decode the offending data. One must have indexes to positions of bytes/data. One could take the icons of the Windows operating system, provide indexes to positions of pixels, and construct any CP image in existence. Are the icons illegal, or is the encoding scheme used to translate that into accessible CP illegal?

This ability exists in the vast majority of the thousands of crypto currency networks.  
  
If it became a survival risk, another thousand networks would be launched with varying solutions to this 'problem'.  
  
Further, existing networks would implement simple bootstrap-style pruning and pre-validation solutions on a block by block basis.  
  
If the most powerful lobbying organizations in the world can't stop decentralized torrents, an activity with little financial incentive, this hydra is nearly invulnerable. They can chop off heads until they are blue in the face. It will hurt; but two will grow in it's place.

The lower your income and more vulnerable a person is the higher the chance that their savings, if it exists, is stored in the local fiat.  
  
There has been a historical governmental monopoly on the currency utilized as a medium of exchange and store of value.

@_date: 2019-01-19 16:38:08
It has nothing to do with who created it.  
Authority has little value here.  
  
The problem is the technical underpinnings of network are unsound.  
A full node in Bitcoin is already semi-bloated; the changes to bcash make that problem literally exponentially worse.  
  
Altcoins with increased "throughput" and "capacity" are nothing new. You can simply look at other longer lived networks and see the result of that experiment.  
  
Additionally, there should be little trust in the technical team behind bcash. When bcash was forked, they chose a retargeting algorithm that had already failed in literally a dozen altcoins. Either they are so inexperienced that they didn't know this, or didn't care - regardless, it doesn't inspire trust.  
  
More importantly, the entire premise is faulty. The idea that Bitcoin doesn't have enough throughput is simply false. Merchants are quite used to paying for transaction uncertainty with their other payment processors - this would be no different with Bitcoin. And that ignores second layer, trustless solutions, which preserve the primary characteristics of the network.

I agree, the road analogy doesn't hold up.  
  
I think the river analogy is much more apt.  
  


  
It will happen; and, likely soon. Worse, there is absolutely nothing that anyone can do about it.  
  


  
It isn't really a unique situation. Tor exit nodes, for instance, have long been confronted with this reality. They provide a public service at some hazard to themselves due to the bad actors which use that technology for ill. Torrents are a similar(ish) situation, where trackers contain 'offensive' links/peer lists.  
  
I am not arguing this is a simple matter.  
No one with any moral or ethical standards supports CP.  
  
However, pretending that is absolutely anything that anyone can do to prevent this is being purposely blind to the reality. Crypto and block chains are decentralized technology. They are here to stay (including the ability to include arbitrary data) and no one on this planet has the power to stop them.  
  
I would argue that a block chain is a public good, and thus that the responsibility and legal hazard lies with the individual who *places* that illegal data on the block chain. Additionally, it makes sense to add a console command to the client which allows an individual node, if notified, to stop serving, and prune specific data. Beyond that... I don't think there is a solution that will satisfy everyone. And, worse, I don't think there is anything anyone can do about that.

The thousands of engineers working in the space would beg to differ.  
  
"Most people" don't know about any of the major paradigm shifts while they are occurring - so, the argument is moot.  
  
You seem to be intent on holding crypto-currency to some 'physical' standard. The same thing was said about Amazon as it competed with brick-and-mortar retail. It is a creature of the internet, and will rise and fall ON the internet.  
  
I have made tens of thousands of dollars worth of purchases with Bitcoin. It may not be 'proven' to you. But, that doesn't change that it has had real, fundamental value in my life, and the lives of many of the people I know. Further, it has served it's purpose in ways that would be quite literally impossible with the conventional system.  
  
The fact that you suggest "blockchain technology" is something special, while simultaneously disregarding Bitcoin, simply proves that you know little about the space. I've said it before, but I will say it again for your benefit: If a blockchain is centralized, in any meaningful way, it is absolutely worthless. Period. Other data structures and protocols would better serve the purpose.

A reasoned response, thank you for that.  
  
A system running on Bitcoin doesn't need Security trucks collecting the til, the branch banks in 10,000 person cities, etc.  A great deal of 'brick-and-mortar' infrastructure, imho. This isn't even considering the cost to humanity of the human capital, which could be working in other spaces. Even if I was to steel man your argument, and buy it, I think the correct way to look at it is as a trade-off. Crypto isn't a silver bullet. It has different characteristics and costs/benefits. I personally believe that the energy cost of maintaining the security of the network is 'worth it'. Your mileage may vary. For the record, quoting skeletor won't help your argument. To anyone who has been watching the space for years, and isn't blind, he is little more than a scammer (though the tech itself is interesting). Ethereum was launched after a pre-pre-sale, for a lower price, to insiders, with an underdeveloped mining software to support instamining.  
  
By 'speed', I was referencing the common argument that the 10 minute block time is too long. I was classifying the transaction backlog as part of the 'capacity' problem. No one has solved this problem. It is a spectrum between centralization with capacity (a simple centralized database) and trustless decentralized Bitcoin. No easy answers. Don't believe the folks arguing for other systems, they have made the same basic trade offs. Some have interesting ideas, for instance the tangle or delegation, but as far as I am aware they all have an element of centralization which enables it.

Lightning isn't a perfect solution.  
  
Specifically, there are concerns that centralized hubs will develop.  
  
I think this will happen but that it won't be a major concern for a couple of reasons.  
The cost to operate a lightning 'hub' will be very low, as there is almost no barrier to entry, a low margin of profit, and it requires only consumer hardware.  
  
In the end, only time will tell.  
I think the important thing is that lightning preserves most of the fundamental attributes of the primary Bitcoin network, namely it's trustless nature.  
  
Freedom doesn't require that every network/market is trust-less and permission-less. It only requires that alternatives are readily available as a competing force. Then it becomes a market struggle and the two systems 'keep each other honest'. When one of the systems out-competes in desirable qualities, it will push the other system towards the 'center' and away from the extremes. This also applies to Bitcoin. When the conventional system provides a better consumer experience, Bitcoin will make mild tradeoffs to compete, becoming more user friendly. Similarly, when Bitcoin outcompetes in the area of censorship resistance and trust-less-ness, the conventional system will respond (the discussions about intrabank blockchains, widespread application of encryption and corporate clashes with government around encryption, etc).  
  
Hopefully, in the end, we end up with options and a system that moderately meets all of our needs, as opposed to a monopoly which has no incentive to change.  
    
At least that is my working theory - we've never done this in modern society.  
So, we're running the experiment for the first time.

You don't 'believe' anyone, you verify it yourself.  
  
Once you see that the transaction has been posted to the network, and has a sufficient fee to eventually confirm, you can consider the payment 'valid' and 'accepted'.  
  
Similar to the conventional payment system, this does not mean that the payment has been 'confirmed'.  
  
In the conventional system customers can issue a chargeback for up to 6 months in many cases.
  
In Bitcoin customers can theoretically 'chargeback' until the payment has received a couple confirmations, though in practice one confirmation is almost always plenty.  
  
So!  
  
Are you taking a small payment?  
Once your wallet software sees the payment you are more than likely fine to allow the customer, for convenience, to leave with the product. This will happen almost instantaneously.  
  
Are you taking a medium sized payment?  
You should probably wait for a single confirmation to ensure that it would be very unlikely that you will end up out of your money.  
  
Are you taking a very large payment?  
In this case, you should wait for at least 6 confirmations to ensure that the likelihood of a 'chargeback' is infinitesimally small.

An interesting example I will need to spend some additional time pondering on. I would argue that the illegal drug trade is only partially decentralized - restricted, as it is, by meat-space.  
  
My preferred analogy is file sharing.

The core software is the *reference client* for Bitcoin.  
  
It is advisory, and not mandatory.  
  
The vast majority of users use other, third-party, clients.  
  
So, in order push through a malicious change an 'evil' actor would need to convince the developers of all of the major clients to change their code.  
  
Without accomplishing this, a rushed change to the consensus rules would result in large portions of the network forking off into different chains.  
  
Shitcash and seg2x are good examples of this :)
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:49:20
Bitcoin can currently **CONFIRM** something around 3-4 transactions per second.  
  
The difference is important.  
A confirmed Bitcoin is roughly equivalent to a settled/funded/past-chargeback conventional transaction.  
In other payment systems this can take months, easily.  
  
Thus, speed of an individual transaction is faster in Bitcoin, throughput is smaller.  
  
Additionally, Bitcoin can handle 'bursts' of transactions much much faster than 3-4 per second, assuming those transactions are between individuals who know each other or a business willing to accept the risk for low-value transactions.

I don't personally believe in calling markets.  
Random walk and all that jazz.  
  
That said, you can think of altcoins as a leveraged position.  
  
During bear markets value flows out of altcoins into Bitcoin so that it can be pulled out of the crypto space. This means that altcoins go down *relative* to Bitcoin, making the absolute move in fiat larger.  
  
During bull markets the opposite is often true. Value seeks out opportunity for gain in the altcoin markets and they often make larger absolute moves against fiat.  
  
Caveat - sometimes altcoins are shitcoins and will skip the bull market entirely or even lose value, sometimes precipitously.

Assuming a ban, which I do not think is entirely clear just yet, it becomes a spectrum of difficulty.  
  
China can shape/block internet traffic, savvy users are well versed in avoiding those blocks.  
  
China can make it illegal/difficult to convert between the conventional banking system and Bitcoin. However, that does not prevent private users from transacting with fiat currency in black/grey/interpersonal markets.  
  
The primary, most effective means by which China could 'ban' Bitcoin would be in the institutional mining space. The nature of a large mining operation, given the electrical requirements and such, would make it difficult and possibly costly to continue operating despite it being illegal.  
  
All of that said, it is a situation of supply and demand.  A complete ban would create serious arbitrage opportunities and with that serious incentive to undermine the ban.  
  
In summary, for the conventional non-technical Chinese user, Bitcoin can indeed be banned. Technical users would find that ban easy to circumvent. Economic incentives would undermine the ban and make it increasingly profitable to circumvent it.

Decentralization is Bitcoin's  feature.  
Without decentralization, Bitcoin is nothing more than a slow expensive database.  
Larger block size makes the chain more difficult to sync and maintain, an activity that is already reasonably difficult and time consuming for an average user.  
Bitcoin cash could theoretically support more transactions than Bitcoin; however, that expansion is not currently in use due to a lack of users and comes at the expense of users being able to sync, maintain and verify their own chain.

The person who 'calls the dip' perfectly buys from someone who 'sold at the bottom'.
The person who 'sells the peak' perfectly sells to someone who 'bought the top'.  
  
By definition, someone must lose in every trade - it is a zero sum game.  
  
Attempting to 'buy low' and 'sell high' is a fool's errand.  
This is the reason many old-hats, in both crypto and conventional markets, repeat the mantra HODL.  
  
Attempting to call markets is little more than 'betting'/'gambling'.  
  
If you have a theoretical advantage of information (which can be illegal in many jurisdictions) it is theoretically possible to consistently 'beat the market'. However, a market such as crypto is global and connected. It is very efficient and effective at pricing in commonly available information. *That* is one of the reasons it is so volatile - the market reflects information extremely quickly.  
  
Essentially, 'it's already priced in'.

The problem with relying on a centralized authority and centralized planning is that you must trust that 'authority' to act selflessly. Humans rarely act selflessly. Ethereum is a great example. The chain was forked to fix incompetence, a fact that should frighten anyone who values the sanctity and security of their funds. Need more evidence that relying on selflessness is unwise? Another less known fact: Ethereum had two pre-sales/ICOs. A first exclusive pre-sale to insiders, and a second public pre-sale to everyone else.  
  
**Speed**  
This is a non-issue driven by a lack of understanding, in my personal opinion. Transactions process nearly instantly in the Bitcoin network. True, they are not 'confirmed' for sometimes up to an hour or two; however, that is faster than existing 'at a distance' payment methods. Credit card transactions often do not 'confirm' for months and are subject to chargebacks for long periods after the transactions is considered 'completed'. Just because conventional payments 'appear' to be 'confirmed' very quickly does not mean that they possess the same immutability that transactions do in Bitcoin. Crypto is a different beast, and operates by different rules. When comparing crypto such as Bitcoin to conventional payments appropriately and in-kind, crypto is considerably faster. Yes, even when the network is bogged down with full blocks.

I don't believe it is existential at all.  
  
It *may* be existential in certain jurisdictions; however, I would bet that geopolitical reality is such that if one major jurisdiction, such as the U.S., attempts to ban crypto currency then others will support it with a full throat purely out of self interest.  
  
That said, I think your 'not the hill to die on' comment is apt. However, it is a very slippery slope. What is next? 'Offensive' transactions?  
  
In the end, this beast has entered the world - and nothing will change that.

No, it isn't a problem at all.  
  
A. The data isn't view-able - indeed, you yourself have strings of hex values on your system which are identical to a string of hex digits that exist in multiple illegal pieces of data.  
  
B. Dumps of the block chain, at this point, exist on literally every single online storage solution of any note. By your logic, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Github, Amazon, every single server host, etc. etc. etc. are storing, willingly, the same hex values and bytes that are illegal.  
  
C. If we steel-man your argument and assume that the data IS view-able, and those hex values do represent 'forbidden' data, there is no hard-fork required to get rid of the data. Any client could be written to simply include blocks that are an issue hard-coded, pre-verified and pre-pruned of the offending data. This would introduce a small amount of trust in the developers, who pre-verified the information, but could be easily cross-verified by trusted individuals in the community. Regardless, it is an extremely rapid solution.  
  
@_date: 2018-03-23 11:18:34
Fair enough.  
  
Simply making the argument that the block chain is a public good.  
  
Similarly, I view the internet as a public good. This argument is slightly askew given that there is a profit motive - however,I would argue that the fact this profit motive (fees and miners) is an egalitarian proposition is a reasonable argument to still consider it a public good.  
  
Child porn exists on the internet and yet I do not view the internet as inherently 'bad'.  
  
Maybe a river would be a better analogy.  
  
When a individual pollutes a river, that individual is committing a crime. Other people are harmed because of that externality - yes. However, we do not attempt to ban the river, or the use of that river by other law-abiding individuals. Nor do we charge individuals who have docks in that river, or boats for use on that river with the crime of polluting that river. Instead, we find the individual who is dumping pollution into the river and attempt to hold them responsible.

If we assume you mean mining, then the answer is: 'sort of'. In actuality, your computer runs a hashing function and the smallest (most leading zeros) hash below the target wins. The target changes, over time, to make sure that all miners combined create a block roughly every 10 minutes.  
  
If we assume you mean the Bitcoin network in general, it is actually quite simple.  
  
We have two problems.  
  
First, we need to be able to verify identity. Users have two cryptographic keys, a public key and a private key. These two keys are related to each other such that anyone can take a message you signed with your private key and compare it to your public key and verify that it was indeed 'you' who signed the message. This allows you to send messages (transactions) over a network and have other users verify that those messages were indeed signed by the owner of that public key.  
  
Second, we need a way to have many different users, with different interests, agree on what transactions have happened so far. We need a way for everyone to come to agreement on the 'state' of the transaction history. You can think of this kind of like the old printer paper with the holes on the sides, where each page is connected to the previous. Solving the mining challenge we outlined above allows a user to create a page of paper listing transactions (block). Each page is connected to the previous page (parent). This gives us an ongoing set of pages (chain of blocks). Everyone agrees on the rules of when it is okay to create a new page, who can create a new page, what to do if two people try to create a new page at once, what   is okay to have on the pages, etc. Thus, everyone remains in agreement (consensus) of the current state of the transaction history.  
  
That is, in a simplified format, 'the bitcoin process'.

@_date: 2017-09-28 22:53:02
That is exactly the fundamental disagreement (and the only legitimate disagreement).  
  
Some believe that users, themselves, in a decentralized manner, should validate the chain.  
  
Others believe that it is 'okay' if a smaller subset of people execute that duty/responsibility.  
  
I believe the former (to the extent possible), and further, believe that flirting with narrowing that subset fundamentally risks the resilience and defense of this system - which we should all be able to agree hasn't even started being *really* attacked yet.

Unless some type of sliding 'difficulty' was implemented per byte for fees, or some type of proof of work, it isn't 'good' for Bitcoin, it's required. A network with zero fees is a network that is filled with spam, bloated, and centralized. Although users who do not use a full client, as opposed to an SPV client, don't seem to understand this: there are very REAL costs to a bloated chain. Real costs that are already felt by those who sync the chain from the genesis to the present day. When you send a transaction, that data must be stored by full nodes in perpetuity, forever.

**First**  
Get your coins to a secure private wallet before the fork.  
This ensures that whatever happens, you get coins on BOTH chains/sides of the fork.  
  
**Second**  
Don't touch your private wallet until you feel comfortable you know what you are doing.  
The process to get the two types of coin separated from each other will likely involved making a send to yourself, at one of your own addresses, and then verifying that the coins are at different addresses on each chain **before** you send coins out to anyone else (to ensure the transaction doesn't get replayed, sending both types of coin to the receiver).  
Again, don't proceed until you feel like you understand the situation.
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:09:00
This is a reasonable understanding of the situation.  
If this trend continues, it does indeed imply that Bitcoin has resistance to change.  
  
Now, the more important question is: Is that a good thing? Personally, I believe it is both a positive attribute and a negative attribute. Does a person really want a monetary system to be 'easy' to change? I think the answer to this is a resounding 'no'. However, Bitcoin is also technology. It *must* change to survive.  
  
It is yet to be determined if the balance, in terms of ease of change, is correct.

As always, you should empty the keys before for your own security.

The bitcoin code repository, and active devs working on it, aren't a monolithic group. The largest single group is associated with blockstream; but, many are not. Frankly, it is a bit rough around the edges as to who exactly *is* and *is not* a *bitcoin dev*. If we set the bar at "has made a commit to the bitcoin code" then there are a great many "bitcoin devs". If we set the bar at "has contributed intellectually or technically via the repository, mailing list, or other communication channel" the list grows even larger. In terms of raw code commits, there are some decent visualizations floating around you can probably dig up.  
  
TL;DR  
Bitcoin is free open source software. It has a repository and various channels used for development discussion. Feel free to contribute.

I don't think you completely grasp the costs involved here.  
  
Even if we assume individuals have access to the storage (those who are not financially well-off or living in a first-world country don't), it is not a matter of simply 'storing' the chain.  
In addition, we have the ongoing costs of bandwidth, the additional time to initially sync the chain (which further dissuades individuals from running a full node), the computational costs of verifying a larger chain (which can substantially increase the initial sync time), and the ongoing costs of maintaining the UTXO (which can also be prohibitive if we reduce the cost of creating additional outputs).  
**Fact:** These costs are already substantial enough to prevent the vast majority of users from running a full node.  
  
Go sync the entire chain, from scratch with a full node, on consumer hardware. Then, bare in mind that much of the planet would be spending a good share of their disposable income to have even 'moderate' consumer hardware.

This isn't necessarily true.  
One could purchase a laptop, remove the wifi card, and the utilize a live OS like Tails(Ethereum) to hold their crypto. Then, when needing to make a transaction, the user would create and sign the transaction on the offline system and manually move it over to an online system.  
It would be, of course, important that the offline laptop *forever* remains *offline*.

It is not uncommon for consumer grade laptops to come with 256GB of SSD storage. The current chain plus an OS would fill a large portion of such a laptop **now**.  
  
You are arguing from an entrenched position.  
The point isn't that it becomes impossible.  
The point is that it becomes prohibitive.  
It is **already** prohibitive and time consuming.  
  
To make matters worse, an increase in the block size isn't a static absolute increase, it is an increase in the **rate of growth** of the chain. Considering it already takes hours and hours to sync the chain it seems a matter of common sense that restricting that growth, and simultaneously limiting spam, is a no-brainer.

No. The node that is pruned in this way would need to rely on the pre-verification, which is less than ideal. Also, would need a simple look-up table to prevent the pruned data from being served to other, possibly 100% validating nodes, which would reject it.

"Increased regulation" is a nearly worthless non-descriptive term.  
  
All regulation is not created equally.  
  
The entire argument for deregulation rests on an expectation that market forces, "muh free muhket', will cure all problems, and reap all benefits.  
  
However, most who use this argument seemed to have not even bothered to read Adam Smith. There are certain prerequisites that are required for a market to be 'free' and to operate effectively. Essentially, *given certain prerequisites* the free market is extremely effective at arriving at efficiency, the net effect of which is increased 'wealth' and an increased standard of living for all.  
  
Again, not all regulation is created equally. There are, in fact, regulations and laws which can *increase* the freedom and efficiency of the market, **AND** there are, in fact, areas where a lack of regulation can negatively impact the ability for a 'free' market to properly allocate resources and create efficiencies.  
  
A properly nuanced approach to a free market strategy would include removing sense-less freedom-restricting regulations while simultaneously creating rules and regulations which would create the fundamental prerequisites even identified in the beginning, by Adam Smith himself.

Assuming you are well meaning (which is cast into doubt given how new your account is on reddit), do you care to cite a study or prove your assertion that half of Bitcoin's market dominance was lost *because of* full blocks?

While possible, this interpretation ignores an important part of mining: electricity.  
  
The cash flow cycle for most mining operations is quite fast. The margin on top of electricity (and other) costs isn't massive and at some point mining rewards must be converted into electricity to fund the next period of mining. Further, there is a very real point at which the margin becomes negative and certain hardware can't even provide for it's own electricity. That point adjusts downward even further if a miner mines a less profitable network, which could actually price out hardware that would otherwise be net positive.  
  
Possible, but the amount of time that can go on is entirely dependent on cash reserves in a market that rewards miners for keeping a low cash reserve to re-invest in new hardware and electricity.

It is a simple conversion, similar to Kilometers and Meters.  
1 kilometer = 1000 meters.  
1 BTC = 1000 mBTC.  
  
Edit:  
It should also be mentioned, just so that we are clear: mBTC **IS** Bitcoin. There is no difference whatsoever. It i simply like holding a fiat U.S. dollar bill in your hand and saying "I have 100 cents."

No.  
They are not.  
  
Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, etc., etc. all almost certainly contain actual viewable child pornography, as opposed to simply links.  
  
Are they illegal as well?  
  
Further, to muddy the waters even more, the bitcoin block chain is hosted on nearly every major data storage service and provider in the world. Are all of those companies criminals as well?  
  
Where do you suggest the line is drawn, huh?  
  
Cameras are used to TAKE child pornography.  
Should they be outlawed?  
  
For hundreds of millions of people who exist in jurisdictions with unstable currency the government quite literally robs their citizens blind. Millions die due to this inflation, unable to purchase food and medicine. Crypto currency provides the very real opportunity to give these individuals access to global markets and a non-inflationary store of value.  
  
The block chain is a public good - maintained by the public. If someone goes around at night and etches child porn links into the cement of buildings and roads throughout a city, to such an extent as to make them not feasible to remove, should the city be abandoned?

This is no different than conventional payment processors.  
The payment processor charges a fee in order to cover the risk of processing the payment.  
  
For small purchases (the proverbial coffee), the payment is processed as a zero confirmation transaction, the processor charges fees to cover the risk of the odd transaction that fails (just as transactions get reversed or clawed back in the conventional system), and kicks out vendors that have an unacceptable level of reversals.

Copy-left would have restricted derivative projects from protecting their IP.  
  
More importantly, when a company publicly declares circumstances under which they will utilize a defensive patent, it does indeed constitute a license of sorts, I would expect indemnifying other parties if they use that patented tech and making it very difficult to convince a judge that the patent is still enforceable.

Diversify your security, eggs in one basket and all that jazz.  
  
Additionally, if it's your thing, diversify with alternative networks.  
  
Currently all roads lead to Rome, thus 'alternative networks' are mostly the assumption of additional risk for the possibility of multiplicative gains (or losses).

A pure PoW change, in one fell swoop, seems a fading dream.  
  
You should press, instead, for a multi-algorithm approach.  
Even a rather small proportion of blocks could serve as an assurance of decentralization.  
  
Further, the prospect of adjusting that proportion down the road, to hamstring a malicious monopoly, becomes much more palatable when it is already a feature of the network.

I appreciate the reasoned response; and, you've earned a great deal of my respect for digging in on identifying which exchanges are regulated/unregulated.  
  


  
That, is a very interesting question. Many KYC/AML exchanges started as unregulated exchanges. It might be that exchanges willing to eventually jump through the regulation hoops are also less likely to fake volume, even during the period they were unregulated.  
  
You might be able to look at the above exchanges, during the period in which they were unregulated, and get a 'dollar of volume per thousand visitors' type figure. If it differs significantly, you could then apply that figure to the unregulated exchanges to identify those which are less likely to have faked volume.
@_date: 2019-05-11 18:41:16
This analysis is thoroughly broken.  
  
It fails to take into consideration the fact that some exchanges apply KYC/AML practices and some do not.  
  
There is a great deal of volume, on no KYC/AML exchanges that is very 'real'. I wouldn't argue the point that there is a great of inflated fake volume - but, the original standard was grep'd from primarily KYC/AML exchanges, and thus is of little use to categorize non-regulated exchanges.

In broad strokes, they are both correct.  
Free markets can't exist without, broadly speaking, both philosophies.  
  
We need the libertarianism of the Austrians to ensure the hazard that allows the market to properly adjust itself.  
  
Conversely, We need the interventionism of the Keynesians to force the markets to properly reflect externalities.  
  
Theoretically, with some 'magic' basic rules no one has yet figured out, there would be no need for the Keynesians.  
  
However, at the moment, the only way we know to meet the fundamental prerequisites of the free market, as outlined by Smith, is through intervention.
