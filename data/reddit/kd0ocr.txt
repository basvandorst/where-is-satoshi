So how does the 1MB user know their payment confirmed on the 20MB chain? If they query other nodes, how do you prevent that from compromising their privacy?


So, if I can gain control of a substantial percentage of 20MB nodes, will I be able to trick 1MB miners into mining blocks that contain a forged transaction from the 20MB chain?
If that happens, will 1MB and 20MB miners start mining on different chains?

@_date: 2015-06-09 04:13:35


Yeah - I should have said it that way from the start.


Well, not really. I mean, the first public release was a thin client. It's pretty clear that it was designed for thin clients from day one.
For example, Bitcoin SPV wallets have no way of discovering what fees are commonly used on the network without consulting a centralized service or having hardcoded limits. On the other hand, in Ripple, fee increases are a part of the protocol, and a client can just look in a recent consensus to find out what the current fee is.


That seems to be a decision that's working fine for them.
@_date: 2015-06-27 00:38:44


True, but you could make a couple of small changes that would make it much harder without compromising its security.
For example, you could have half a dozen trusted nodes, where one of them creates the next block, and the rest of them sign it after validating it. Then, to keep any transaction out of the consensus, you'd need to get all of the trusted signers to cooperate. Some of these nodes could be in different jurisdictions, hidden by proxies, etc.
This is more or less the system that Sidechain Elements has.

That ship sailed a while ago: nodes can lie about `filterload` commands trivially. (Incidentally, Mike Hearn wrote that one too.)


How can it just as easily live outside? No matter what, you need a UTXO database to answer these commands. So, you can either run servers to do this yourself, or ask bitcoin users to compile and run a second process. Neither really seems ideal.

The guy stabbing people and taking their money doesn't benefit. The fence he would have sold their property to doesn't benefit. People benefit on average, but they don't all benefit.
The issue here is not one of consent. You might want to consent to sell your Bitcoins to TOTALLY_NOT_A_DRUG_DEALER_69 anonymously, but the government has a reasonable interest in knowing who you sell those to, so that they can go arrest them for dealing drugs. Requiring that exchanges keep addresses and provide them to the government at their request seems like a reasonable way of accomplishing that.


I agree. If I start my own government called Freedomtopia, and declare that it's a crime to counterfeit Freedomtopia's money, I'm not going to have much luck with that.
However, trying that argument in front of a federal judge will not get you very far. Nor will it be compelling to a voter - government issued money, and counterfeiting laws solve their problems well enough that they're not going to be inclined to change them over some sort of vague principle.


Less than 0.1% of the world uses Bitcoin or Bitcoin derivatives. Government-issued money is hardly irrelevant. Nor is Bitcoin inherently secure - the top three mining pools could collaborate and exclude all other blocks. 


I agree with A. You're not stating B in least sufficient form. That is, in order to support the previous statement, B only needs to be, "men with guns is a more efficient form of market regulation than ~~any~~ the voluntary organic alternative that will arise." I agree with the modified form of B.

The issue is that as a merchant, I have to decide if SatoshiCoin is as valuable as VBNCoin, or if it's less valuable than BailyJayCoin. In order to accept payments from a large number of people, you'd need to be compatible with dozens of different systems.
You can insert some kind of middleman to exchange between currencies, but then your ability to make payments with your cryptocurrency of choice is determined by a bunch of market-makers who don't answer to you. The currencies will shift relative to each other, and what you can buy today with the money in your wallet will be totally different from what you can buy tomorrow.

Maybe I didn't communicate that very clearly. Group A are mining on 20MB and 1MB. Group B is mining on 1MB only. 
I mine a block that has a problem in the 20MB section. The 20+1MB nodes immediately reject this. The 1MB nodes ask 20MB nodes whether it's valid, which it isn't. But whenever they ask my nodes, my nodes lie.
(I also control a large number of publicly accessible 20MB nodes, but not a majority of hashpower.)
So, in that situation, how do the 1MB nodes and the 20MB nodes reach consensus?

Then, I find a merchant who only uses 1MB blocks, and offer to pay them with B. How are they supposed to tell that it's already been spent?
Also, if a miner creates an invalid block, but the invalid part is in the 20MB portion, how are 1MB miners supposed to know not to mine on that block?

Suppose someone comes on reddit complaining that their transaction isn't confirming.

None of the major pools will process the transaction, and all of the miners without anti-spam rules are too busy dealing with spam to confirm his transaction.
It seems like there will be no way to know if your transaction will be considered "legitimate."

There is both a soft limit and a hard limit on the size of blocks. Soft limits are enforced only by the miner that generates the block, but hard limits are enforced by the entire network, so everyone needs to upgrade to make it happen.
We're talking about increasing the hard limit. 
If we increased the hard limit, and there were transactions to fill the space, disk, bandwidth, and CPU requirements would go up by 20.
If we don't increase it, and there are more transactions than can fit in a block, then unconfirmed transactions just pile up, and will eventually start crashing Bitcoin nodes.

It seems like there's precedent for making the creation of certain computer programs illegal, like malware. Malware uses math just as much as Bitcoin exchange programs do - should creating it be legal?
If it seems like I'm coming up with arbitrary and unrelated examples, that's because I am. I haven't seen a clear principle that the law should be based on. (In this discussion, at least.) For example, 'no regulation governing X should be made,' or 'all transactions that are X should be legal.' If you articulated that, I could argue against it instead of guessing what your position is. It seems like you're arguing some variant of NAP, but with math somehow.


Let me give you a concrete example of harm that would have been mitigated by BitLicense: MtGox. The reporting requirement would have forced them to figure out how many Bitcoins they actually had, and would have forced them to go public when they discovered they didn't have enough Bitcoins to cover everyone's deposits.
Of course, this example wouldn't hold water if, 1) you don't consider the MtGox incident to have had  actual human victims, or 2) you show that BitLicense wouldn't have mitigated it.

So Roger was wrong about that, but that doesn't insulate OKCoin from liability, because CZ was an officer of the company, so he had the authority to sign this contract, whether or not Star approved it.

Um, no it won't. If the bottom 20% of transactions don't go through, "just pay more money" doesn't help. If those people pay a larger transaction fee, then some other 20% of Bitcoin users will not have their transactions confirm.
People paying more fees doesn't make blocks larger. The only way that fees will help is if they become *so high* that some people who would make a Bitcoin transaction decide not to.

That's not strictly true - testnet has a rule that says that after 20 minutes of no blocks, difficulty resets to minimum. So I can point my ASICs at testnet, pump through blocks until I get to a difficulty of 10000, then turn them off for twenty minutes.

@_date: 2015-05-17 22:04:04
1) This only protects you if the wallet has no other ways of communicating. E.g. If it can ask the host for updates, or for unspent outputs, then it's not secure. Hell, a malicious device could just pretend to be a keyboard, open a web browser, and type in your private keys.
2) It doesn't address timing leaks.
3) This assumes that the host machine that the hardware wallet is plugged into isn't compromised. If it is, and there's, for example, a buffer overflow (intentionally or unintentionally) that lets the host system take the wallet over, this doesn't protect you.
4) How is the user supposed to generate enough entropy? Suppose that each hardware wallet's RNG is backdoored, and it will only generate 12 bits of entropy. Let's suppose that the user types in, on a two-button keyboard, an additional 44 bits of entropy. Okay, that's 56 bits of entropy in total. Entirely bruteforce-able.

This is an argument of the form:

Suppose, for example, that someone breaks into your house, and gets a look at one of your paper wallets. They then steal all of the Bitcoins in that wallet. Under your suggested legal theory, the only thing they'd be guilty of is trespass.

The exact same logic can be applied to confirmed transactions. Suppose a miner with 10% of the network hashpower sees a block on the network that collects 100 BTC in fees. If the miner ignores that block, and mines from the parent of that block, he has a 5% chance of catching up and overtaking the original block. This would allow him to take all of those fees for himself. 
     0.10 * 25BTC (anticipated profit from playing nice) &gt; 0.05 * 125 BTC (anticipated profit from cheating)
So the same logic that allows replace-by-fee allows replace-block-by-fee.
There's an edge case where everybody is doing this, but in that circumstance you can just implement a timeout where if nobody builds the next block for a long time, you go back to mining normally.
TL;DR: Don't trust a transaction unless it's embedded into the genesis block.

I agree with the point that I think greeneyedguru was trying to make, which is that defining particular classes of transactions as spam is dangerous, because it invites the court of public opinion to rule on whether a particular class of transactions should be excluded.

You're not accurately summarizing the thread. There are nine top-level responses to your post that aren't hidden by default:
* Maybe I'm strange but every time I read one of those CryptoLocker stories I can't help but think how amazing it is that Bitcoin can even make that possible.
* IMO the best outcome is using blockchain forensics to lead to the criminal(s)' arrest.
* I agree. Everything that's "wrong" with bitcoin is really a problem with [...] All of these problems will be solved in time, and bitcoin is actually pushing them to be solved faster.
* Cryptolocker is an excellent advancement in malware in my opinion.
* ✕ Maybe come up with compelling legal use cases for Bitcoin? [...] don't require people to buy into fringe political beliefs to appreciate.
* If bitcoin couldn't be used by criminals, it wouldn't be very good form of money actually,
* Four words: "I didn't do it".
* ✕ If bitcoin is going to succeed it has to be good enough for the world that actually exists, not the world you wish existed.
* You are wasting your time trying to craft a response to the people who get infected by Cryptowall (or are blind to similar attempts). They are lemmings in the digital world and part of the problem.
Two of the nine (marked with ✕) are complaining about a lack of compelling use cases. 


I agree with you in general, but in a discussion about the public perception of Bitcoin, a lack of legal use cases is entirely relevant. If there were some important socially-valuable business that couldn't exist without Bitcoin, we could point at that to shut down a 'terrorists will use bitcoin' argument.

How many people has it hurt/killed? How severely were they hurt, on average?
If a major safety flaw was discovered in their product, did they fix it? Did they recall affected units?
What are the alternatives? For example, I wouldn't support a ban on a procedure that killed 50% of the patients it was used on, if not having the procedure caused 60% of them to die.
Then there are contexts where some other need trumps safety. For example, I think [assisted suicide]( ought to be legal.

transaction fees instead.  It's as simple as this: let the output value from 
any transaction be 1 cent less than the input value.  Either the client 
software automatically writes transactions for 1 cent more than the intended 
payment value, or it could come out of the payee's side.  The incentive value 
when a node finds a proof-of-work for a block could be the total of the fees in 
the block.
When asked about how mining would be funded without block rewards, Satoshi suggested that a transaction fee of one cent could be applied.

It has the progress problem - the guy with 50% more computing power has more than a 50% better chance at finding a block.

He's saying this:

He actually didn't. He was *found* guilty. That was the point of the trial.

I've always felt that our mental institutions were underfunded. Well, after four years of McAfee, nobody is going to make that mistake again!

I don't think it's particularly fair to demand one standard of evidence for the people you like, and another for those you dislike.

Not entirely. Imagine that I have four CPU cores working on different hashes, using 500MB for each of their datasets, and 2GB total. Then, the user opens a new application. I kill off one of the threads, and free up 500MB.

I think you're missing my question. Suppose you're a miner, with, say, 1% of total hashrate. How do you decide whether an incoming block is too big?

I'm actually not clear on what hospital bombing you're talking about. Link?


Presumably Shaun would dispute it. :)
