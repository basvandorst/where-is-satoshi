You should be put in a fucking 12'x12' room with padded walls and no windows.
And yes, I'm calling you a deplorable human being. Anyone who passionately chooses to believe ridiculous conspiracy theories about the Clintons and simultaneously chooses to ignore the litany of crimes Trump is guilty of is a total and complete imbecile.
You're so fucking brainwashed you've got Dawn dish soap coming out your ears.

lmao... I can't tell if you're being serious or not but quite honestly at this point I would take Sarah Palin over Putin's puppet that we've currently got in office.

7.5% premium to use GDAX on top of the transaction fee? Seems a bit steep.
Are there any other exchanges that offer a better value than that?

Jesus, you're dumb. It amazes me the depths of stupidity you idiots are capable of. You've somehow managed to conflate cryptocurrency with a ridiculous conspiracy theory about American politics. How dare you lecture everyone else while your own government is being sold down the river by a treasonous Russian Manchurian candidate because YOU'RE a DEPLORABLE traitor who betrayed your country. And you're still worried about Clinton and absurd conspiracy theories. You fucking coward. Stop whining, snowflake. For once in your life take some personal responsibility and stop blaming everyone else for your problems. I'm sick of hearing you cucks cry about everything under the sun.
