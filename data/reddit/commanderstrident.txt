IIRC you are supposed to pay taxes quarterly. Usually, an employer does it for you. Bitcoin is on your own, so you are supposed to pay quarterly on gains. That being said, you only have to pay as much as your total income last year. So, if you didn't make much last year and then made a ton this year, you are okay.

It'll be removed when the devs are comfortable with the stability of the code. Right now they aren't even calling it beta. It'll be some time. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 19:01:08
We will be having a professional audit done before the release. Details to come later.

Using Bitcoind and LND

Thanks for the kind words. I'm glad you were able to build your own version from scratch!

As I recall as long as the block headers of the current block match other nodes then you are good. The whole point of blockchains is that you cannot update the past without affecting the present. In regards to making sure we are using an untampered with bitcoind node. We are looking into ways users can verify that. Some sort of signing mechanism. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 03:27:01
Yeah, this is more correct than my original answer. We will offer the ability to do a full chain download, but it will be your choice. A full download on our hardware will take quite a long time :/ Sorryz
@_date: 2018-09-05 05:15:53
We have other services that we use that aren't open source yet. We will probably put out 90% of it at some point. Don't want to give it away too early.

bitcoind and lnd

I wonder if they are building an app that integrates with Coinbase. Maybe then it isn't Coinbase official.

lolz. I wish I could inflate btc and keep all of it for myself!

Does having more small nodes make a noticeable difference on the stability of the network? Given the fact that these nodes don't have much mining power.

Yes to this. The whole reason hardware wallets exist is for security.

A 'bread wallet' is a wallet you use to buy your bread and butter. I personally keep less than $200 worth of BTC on my phone's (bread) wallet. I have some in an exchange, but most in cold storage (Trezor).

Personally, I believe they were mad that BCH gave them just two weeks notice and are not releasing BCH until 2018. 
Officially, they have to vet blockchain for security and stability before they release a product to millions of users. GDAX/CB moves markets.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:40:05
CoinBase is for new people. It is as easy as it can be. GDAX is CoinBase's physical exchange. If you 'start' a trade on CB it is actually settled in GDAX. Because CoinBase is so easy peasy, they charge higher fees. 
Gemini is build for wall street. You can share accounts, have different roles per user.
Poloniex has tons of shit coins and is not transparent. I had a support ticket with them for over two months where my funds were locked up. CB usually responds in a day or two. 
 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:47:53
Coinbase is a really keep it simple stupid exchange. Really easy to get in an out, simple interface. One step up is to use GDAX. Less fees with the same level of security. You can buy on GDAX and pull it off into a hardware wallet or move to Coinbase and store in their Vault. 
Gemini and Poloniex are the two biggest other US exchanges. Polo is scary to use. They have almost no customer support. Gemini is okay, but geared more towards institutions.

On the Calculate tab, I see capital gains for BTC and LTC, but not BTC/LTC. I'm guessing you are saying that selling LTC from BTC/LTC gets bundled in capital gains for LTC and vis versa.
@_date: 2017-04-13 00:54:15
Does bitcoin.tax plan on implementing a feature to pull in btc/ltc trades? I noticed it does litecoin and bitcoin, but not btc/ltc. That would be really helpful :)
@_date: 2018-11-07 03:23:05
Tor is on the roadmap. Plan is to have bitcoind and lnd running on tor by default.
@_date: 2018-11-06 23:17:06
You are correct. We are using http right now, but are planning on switching over to https. It's pretty challenging to get https to work with a home server and have great ux. We have a solution in mind, b in t we want to get it done right.

Sorry, you are having some trouble with the node. We are still building out our customer support process, but let me dm you and get a call set up.

Things are good and things are not so good. Single hop sends and receives work like a charm without issues. Multi-hop has many issues. Just the other day, I was trying to send a multi-hop payment and the payment got stuck halfway. The protocol caught it and I am being refunded, but it is a multi day ordeal.

I like bitfinex, but there has been some negative reviews about possible insider trading with things like spooky the trader. Also there is negative attention around usd tether. I'm not sure on the validity of both claims. I use both. Coinbase is easy for american's to get their money into crypto. Bitifinex has better products, especially lending. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:17:55
Right now we are still building out the product. And of course LN isn't ready for prime time yet. The first product will be for everyday customers just trying to send funds from one person to another. Later on, we plan on servicing businesses and ideally high-frequency arbitrage traders. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:57:30
Well, we will be operating as a business trying to stay solvent at some point, so there is likely to be some charge. It remains to be seen if charges will come from B2B or B2C at this time.

Can we put a more user friendly link up? If we want mass adoption, point and click install is the way to go.

haha, I'll take it. There are plenty of things to keep us busy. I'm glad we can let Coinbase deal with holding funds. I think it'll really help push the big guys along knowing that third parties can do these types of integrations. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:04:33
I think it'll be possible. I put a fair amount of work into building a few models. Couldn't get the base price under 100$ though.

Autopilot will reduce the average number of hops to a node, but it won't reduce it down to one. Think of the game seven degrees of Kevin Bacon. How many hops to get to anyone in the world? Probably more than 1, but less than 20. The more channels each person has open the better.

There is an authorization step in the demo, it is similar to what purse.io does. It allows them to pull or push funds into your Coinbase account. We do the same. We just have to make sure we have funds available on both LN and in Coinbase in our accounts. If we don't have enough of one side, we just send the funds back and you can try again later. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 05:16:10
This is something we are looking into. We think we will be exempt from most of the heavy regulations because we aren't in custody of any funds, but the question is still unresolved.

Pretty Much. GDAX requires a higher skill, because it is more complicated. This results in saving on fees. Coinbase is for new users who don't want to understand for the actually trading occurs and pay a larger fee for it.

Depends on the country you live in. There is no precedent in the USA atm. Coincenter has the opinion it is not.    
@_date: 2017-07-29 14:45:48
You don't need to transfer BTC back to coinbase, unless you want to store it in their vault. There are pros and cons to that. The most important this is to buy on gdax. Market rates are .5% and market takers are 0%. You could pull your BTC directly off gdax and into a hardware wallet if you like.
