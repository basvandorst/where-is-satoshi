because the entire fund moved from the cold storage into another wallet address i dont recognize. Although my trezor still seems to register the balance i should have.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:11:40
anytime i hear stupid arguments about btc it just makes me want to buy more because its a sign its still so early.
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:11:40
use bisq for fiat onramp and then use  for alts or stake bco coins to get 50% of all profits from all coins.... its a decentralized exchange for alts
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:59:24
there is 0% chance it's CW... i will cut my dick off on camera if its him
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:44:45
you can help test the network for free on the test network
@_date: 2018-01-21 05:11:02
for alts check out  it's a dex with 50% profit share
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:46:58
yes i was just nervous because it wasnt any of my receiving addresses. The trezor is keeping the right balance.
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:26:04
ok thank you so much so its ok i cant see the address anywhere from my trezor platform right?
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:17:20
i have the btc i moved in the exchange but my entire wallet address changed. Is this normal for a trezor?
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:49:36
SOMEBODY ONCE TOLD ME
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:14:06
please anyone? should i move the funds from my trezor into a receiving address just to make sure?? please help
@_date: 2018-01-15 04:11:42
ok thanks. That really got me scared when i saw ALL the funds move out.
@_date: 2018-01-28 16:03:05

thx for the finger pointing. I couldnt figure out where the bitcoin sign was.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:34:11
when btc is worth millions it is assumed it wouldve replaced USD
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:17:18

@_date: 2017-12-16 18:29:20
just look at his bitcoin stash. It went from 90k at one point to 0 during the bcash fud. Then he started buying back and/or keeping his mined coins. And now has little over 20k lol. rekt.
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:12:42

@_date: 2017-12-09 17:20:35
LMFAO. Weak. How do you think people with a lot of bitcoins feel? FINE! Cause they're used to these kinds of things and invest based on fundamentals. Sell your BTC you dont deserve it. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:30:21

bitmex is also selling their bcash and buying bitcoin either before or on dec. 31
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:12:00
why support that cancer company? new miners coming out
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:53:33
Ok maybe you are a supporter and not just trying to get business. Bitpay immediately sells the bitcoins so if a lot of people use it the price will go down.
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:01:11
Some say diamonds have no value because they are common and manipulated yet the Hope diamond sells for millions. Some say pop art is worthless but it sells for hundreds of millions. Some say bitcoin is worthless yet it could buy the Hope Diamond and all the pop art.

First. It's his money so his decision. Secondly I actually convinced my sister to get her money out of her 401k and put it in bitcoin. I personally find bitcoin to be the safest investment around.
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:09:26
you came to a bitcoin forum to ask about stocks? get out.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:17:16
u realize u couldve only mined in those periods right?
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:40:10
lmao did you just say btrash is way better than btc? Do you not know about the miners spamming the network? Do you know about companies not implementing segwit? Do you know lightning is on the way? Sell your shit please and get the fuck outta here.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:36:10
dont think you're special. No offence but it's easy to make money in a super bull market like the crypto

@_date: 2017-12-17 03:32:45
Fair price is AT LEAST parallel with gold. Which would put bitcoins well over 6 figures.
What do you mean real money? WHat's real money? FIAT? Bitcoin is real money to me.

gemini is awesome... i love their exchange. Lower fees than coinbase and they pay for outgoing transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:07:48
gemini has like 1% fee or whatever. It's not bad. I use it for large purchases.

@_date: 2017-12-12 03:32:24

i like the tone of this article.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:42:48
It seems new... I also have no idea how they would implement fiat into a decentralized exchange... maybe it'll be another bittrex.. but decentralized.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:59:43
never part with bitcoin for any reason whatsoever.
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:11:38
slush is probably one of the best companies in the bitcoin industry. I hope they get huge.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:20:28
there are stories of people having money stuck there for months due to verification. I'm only waiting a few weeks. Theyre behind.
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:32:34
100 bitcoins and I will never need to work.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:53:35
So we should trust you with bitcoin donations? Seems unlikely.

@_date: 2017-12-14 21:20:26
lots of people will tell u it's risky. But in my opinion it's less risky since your dollar keeps losing value in the bank. Especially if you're hodling for years, you will def be glad. Do it. Don't listen to these newbies telling you it's risky. Bitcoin is here to save us and it's here to stay.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:10:20

Ok you are somewhat new since bitcoin has been through this hurdle many many times over. There once was a time when china led the bitcoin markets. There would be FUD that china is banning bitcoin every few months. Price would drop (because people thought most bitcoiners were chinese) and pick back up. Also the minors to this day cause issues for bitcoin but they don't have as much power as people once thought. Look into the no2x movement. The backers were basically the miners and big businesses. Only people against it were the people and most of the developers. Hence bcash was born. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:18:17

This one is close to waking.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:08:31
its more profitable to buy and hold bitcoins themselves rather than mining it.... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:29:02
its first a store of value and second or maybe third a currency

That computing power also secures the network so it's a necessary evil. Plus btc is usually farmed in places with cheap electricity meaning those places had excessive energy anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:38:55

trezor is open source so the code is impossible to be corrupted. Also, it's damn near impossible for anyone to move crypto from trezor without multiple verification... this story makes 0 sense

@_date: 2018-03-25 19:15:56
Depends entirely on btc price and for a business that needs to have things planned for a long time, it makes no sense. Some CEO said they have about 2 years or so already planned.
