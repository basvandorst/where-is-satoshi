Idk why I laughed but maybe it’s because you were so anti not reporting taxes that the fella you were talking to convinced you and you were like “great! Gonna ‘look’ into it.”

I did a transaction from Coinbase to BITTREX using bitcoin.
Wtf that shit not only took forever but the fee was 7.16%?! 
What exactly is bitcoin good for? Slow transaction times and high fees. Fuck that shit

Not sure to be honest. All I know is I got charged 4$ on a 40$ transaction. That’s just mad

To be perfectly honest idk how Fb even got an IPO. What exactly could it provide investors in the terms of making money?

Because it’s gonna be obsolete? What changes can they bring right now that makes it even relevant?
