Dump BTC. Buy LTC = Long Term Coin
@_date: 2015-06-07 03:30:43
Only a little over 1,000 unconfirmed right now. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 06:32:46
Fontas came back so I don't see why they couldn't.
@_date: 2015-06-06 01:07:51
Playing tug of war with the US Government. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 11:09:26
It's supply and demand. Going up the demand is there because people want to buy. Going down the supply is there because people don't want to continue to lose money. How far down we go depends when the next demand starts. That may be when BTC hits a new low below $160

Lets say miners are well funded or at least the big ones. The run up and down got everyone who wanted to sell to sell. The large weak hands are out. People want to buy millions and we're going to find out where the next resistance is. We could just continue to break new highs if some idiots want to blow a ton of money on Bitcoin. Then we'll short it all the way back down.

They could be selling BTC they don't have to keep knocking the price down. But those buying those fake BTC would have to withdraw and eventually there would be withdraw problems because so much fake BTC was sold. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 04:49:18
Yes, no issues then.
@_date: 2015-06-07 23:31:10
Good. Lets move our coins to a better online wallet.
@_date: 2015-06-30 23:00:55
Litecoin if you caught the bottom which was $1.05 and it hit $4.67 today. Even if you bought just under $2 not that long ago. Pays to be in more than one coin. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 00:59:47
Probably why the dumping started early. Once it comes out everyone else will start dumping. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 18:08:53
How can you hold, not use margin and be short? So you're not long you are just slowly watching your buying power go down and you pray that some years from now it'll come back up.
@_date: 2015-06-01 11:41:12
Until people stop shorting, buying off the exchange for cheaper then dump on exchange, buy low, sell high and the people high sell, bagholders giving up sell, bearwhales that have hundreds of thousands of coins that are not done dumping. So many reasons to still dump. I mean someone has been buying the last 5 months in the $200's and most are not in profit. People going long are not in profit and will have to close in a loss soon. All adds up to sell pressure. 
@_date: 2015-06-13 04:13:28
Don't make them get wallets and don't transfer them bitcoins. 
Just make a presentation and have info graphic on how bitcoins can be transferred. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 16:06:41
Till you're broke and get auto closed and then become the next er
@_date: 2015-06-11 23:18:59
They just want to know why you need so many Bitcoins. So they can let the Government know. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 11:13:41
With the way BTC is going down no one will have money left to buy LTC.
@_date: 2015-06-01 06:22:22
I can't wait. Shorting Bitcoin to 0
@_date: 2015-06-01 11:05:38
The truth is 85,000 BTC are long on Bitfinex. If price goes low they have to sell those bitcoins in order to cover their losses. About 7,500 BTC in support on Bitfinex. Price continues down and they start selling the price will continue down. 
Those long continue to try and keep price up in hopes more people buy in so they don't have to sell at a loss. 
@_date: 2015-06-07 03:31:16
I'm buying via localbitcoins. All aboard!
@_date: 2015-06-10 23:12:21
Smart money entering now. Suppress price. Buy off exchange. If something happens that makes people buy BTC on exchanges price goes up till people buying here sell. Repeat. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 12:51:08
Meh. LTC support disappearing like someone was just propping up the price to unload a few more bags and then sold the rest. Now only the remaining believers are buying. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 06:22:22
I can't wait. Shorting Bitcoin to 0
@_date: 2015-05-30 01:59:42
If the price crashes then I'll blame this stress test. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 04:39:29
Yeah we purposely fucked up the network for most of the weekend. 
Lets hope someone doesn't repeat this and fuck up the network for a week. 
"Bitcoin is broken" headlines in the news.
@_date: 2015-05-30 23:27:06
The idea is no one wants to sell the number of coins necessary to drop the price low enough to where the longs start closing. Someone could be waiting and ready to buy up 30,000 coins and you're out of ammo. 
It looks like the price may go up to $300, $400, $500 and then the longs close in profit and the people wanting to buy as many Bitcoins as they can will get their hands on the longers Bitcoins that way. 
Could it be that there are many people around the world with tens of millions looking to put it into Bitcoin as a safe way to store their money. That's why everyone is going long and not closing. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 02:45:57
There is only so much room in a block till the lazy developers change it.  
@_date: 2015-05-30 23:16:08
There is over 200,000 BTC on Bitfinex and they just got hacked earlier this month and lost 1500 BTC. So not much. Still pretty safe. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 23:36:42
Do you see how many people are showing up to the government auction for the silkroad coins? Only 1 more left and then they will have to resort to buying on the exchanges. Price won't go down much once they hit the brick wall of buyers. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 04:47:40
Looks like .2 to .4 btc a block. Could estimate 5,000 transactions every 1 btc in fees to do this. 
So if you have 50btc to waste you can create 250,000 transactions and create a huge traffic jam basically. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 00:25:12
Limited amount of time to accumulate in the $200's for everyone world wide. Eventually we'll run out of weak hands if the miners have contracts set up with buyers already. 
In the mean time Litecoin halving is soon. Pretty much worth it to just sit in LTC incase it pumps from $2 to $10 because strong hands hold and there isn't many coins left to be mined before the halving. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 01:33:20
Eventually we'll get like 6 blocks in 20 minutes that'll clear out a bunch. Just gotta wait. 
Not sure why it maxes out where it does. Doesn't look good though. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 02:32:43
We did it Reddit! And they said this would be a problem in 2016. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:53:48
almost 25,000 unconfirmed 
@_date: 2015-05-30 03:35:27
The miner who found it doesn't want to accept any transactions. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 03:40:28
How much money you have to spend. 
That's why it shouldn't be a hard limit. If the banks and government team up to backlog the network then it'll automatically go to 40mb. Eventually the group doing it would stop. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 12:49:33
Old news. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 03:18:06
and if you don't have an option to change transaction fee you're stuck waiting and waiting and waiting for this to stop. Of course over time everyone / web sites should be able to adapt to this situation. Just sucks now.
@_date: 2015-07-07 03:55:40
Nice. I have a feeling I'm going to sleep and wake up to see it still unconfirmed. Then wait the whole day and watch the stress test continue. 49,000 unconfirmed transactions right now.
@_date: 2015-07-07 00:43:58
Damn. Almost 9 hours since I bought some coins on localbitcoins and moved them off that site and I'm still waiting for them to show up on my end. Couldn't find a way to increase transaction fee either. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 01:12:51
Because it's a shitty designed site that gets rid of old transactions even though they have not been confirmed.
@_date: 2015-07-02 18:39:42
The 2 big pools are in China and they control 72.4%
OKCoin, also in China moves the price. 
After the halving I'm betting that 72.4% goes up to 80%-90% and then make LTC the national currency. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 01:14:30
Lucky. I read on localbitcoins they sometimes change the fee from 0.0001 up to 0.0004 BTC and I got stuck with the 0.0001 fee. Maybe others are getting lucky and got a bigger fee.
@_date: 2015-07-21 01:26:40
That 1 exchange had willybot to pump price. Now who will pump. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 19:55:40
I've been waiting 4 hours for my first confirmation. Soon I hope. Default fee. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 03:20:44
People can't move their coins to the exchanges to dump. They are waiting for confirmations. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 19:45:22
I bought BTC to buy LTC before it goes up another $2 and now I've been waiting 4 hours for my BTC to show up so I can buy LTC. Ffffuuuu this is why everyone is switching to LTC. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 03:20:27
Devs can't come to a decision and keep putting it off.
@_date: 2015-07-07 01:01:45
@_date: 2015-07-07 03:30:24
"China controlling everything."
China response is, "OK, we'll make 4 different names to make it look less obvious."
Like with LTC the top 2 pools are from China and control 70% 
@_date: 2015-07-22 02:20:32
Exit pumps. Exit pumps everywhere. I feel bad for the $27,816,663 long on Bitfinex. A lot of people going to lose a lot of money when this dumps hard.
@_date: 2015-07-07 03:07:26
Same. Waiting 11 hours now. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 02:09:12
This. Someone wants to send thousands upon thousands of transactions and pay to do it. You can pay more to get ahead of them or wait your turn behind them.
