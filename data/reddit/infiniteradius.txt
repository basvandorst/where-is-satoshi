Bullet points don't really work when centrally aligned if you want some unsolicited constructive criticism.

People have done it, although it's obviously rare.
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:56:06
I already stocked up on it just in case this goes tits up ;)

2000 happened bitches!
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:56:42
I'm panic buying right now.

I keep mine on dropbox (encrypted of course), which also means I can revert it in the case of a ransomware attack.

We just wanted to eliminate the weak before we go to the moon.

God damn I'm happy for you! Your aura makes me feel pretty too.
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:12:22
Liquid courage!

Fuck, I mined 11k Doge for fun a few years ago and was happy it's now valuable enough to just about offset my electricity cost (ATI GPU, that thing ran HOT).
I haven't cashed in yet either,  but that was a bold move waiting out on $500 dogecoin. Glad it's paying off for you.

lol I just checked it again after your comment and watched it shoot up $25 in like 5-6 seconds. This is fun!

I feel like bitcoin needs to ride out a serious financial crisis then people will really understand its worth (or lack thereof).
I've used bitcoin a ton and just wish I could handle more payments with it. Hopefully with a 2008 style crisis investors, banks, etc. will see the same.

Nah this 1.5BTC is gonna buy me a house on Beverly Hills next week ;)
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:50:14
That's a fuckin' noisy gif.
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:11:38
Fuck it I've just bought 1.5 BTC which is a serious chunk of cash for me. If I didn't have plans tonight I'd be taking a shot for every $5 I make.
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:55:51
Nah I put it on my credit card, this is a guaranteed thing right?
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:57:41
Where I'm from too. Good job I don't have friends to go to the bar with!
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:58:39
I do have a strong hand if you know what I mean.
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:58:38
As long as your rate's locked in...

I took a powernap at 2800 and woke up at 2300. What a ride!

I'll message you on 2017-05-26 18:58:35 UTC to remind you of this post with the message
"You're on the fucking moon mate"

I've never used it but I quickly googled for you and it sounds like you need to backup manually.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:32:29
I hope so. Bitcoin is insanely useful, beyond just drug money and stuff. The signed verified forward only log is fucking amazing, as someone that's spent time working with outdated financial systems.
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:18:29
Holy shit even if that original investment was a dollar that's fucking $2300.
