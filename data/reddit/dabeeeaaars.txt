Futures reduce volatility actually.. they short to the value they think it’s actually worth.. thus creating a kind of floor. Granted it can go below but good luck to anyone who tries to short btc .. like can you guess what it’ll be in Jan 17th 5pm est?

I guess you could try to sell on local bitcoin for cash in hand, and try not to get robbed or scammed 
Or pay your due

Year isn’t finished yet

They bundled them up and sold them to other banks dumb enough and then shorted them

 A btc crash would cause a massive exodus.. I’ve spoken to to many people who have NO idea what blockchain even is that are investing 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:14:46
Just no
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:37:28
Well you’re faith was weak. 
Doubling your money on an investment is amazing. That takes 6-7 years for a normal 401k. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:04:00
Shorts have Unlimited potential fucking I hope they do it
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:22:15
This is not a good thing for crypto 
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:26:08
Fords much smaller then VW Toyota and gm tesla .. I can go on 
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:04:21
How so? Ford is 43B gm 53B tesla 53B and VW is like 80B that's a huge gap 
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:27:10
We need the big investment firms like fidelty and vanguard to start these 
Easily 25k

I seriously wonder when we will hear about the first btc person kidnapped for their private key .. 
Everyone; when you are your own Bank be safe!
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:26:04
Man I️ am so sorry this happend but why on God’s green earth would you leave 120k on an exchange 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:37:03
Assumptions made on the first wallets used to be his
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:18:31
I agree. Most exchanges are fucking wack
I think what coinbase is doing is awesome, I hope they go public and I can invest in them 
Every person who gets the app and has an easy way to get into cyrpto is what’s driving this market.. let em fee fuck ya those servers aren’t free 
I r never had a single issue moving cyrpto from coinbase towallets

I'm sorry but if you think bitcoin will save the world from corruption your wrong. It's transparent sure, if you know where to look. But that won't help for a really long time, if it's even adopted mainstream and maybe if bitcoin is the chosen one which it likely won't be long term
Not only that, but let's be real- the US government would LOVE to make a currency on the block chain and just know every single little thing you do in one convenient place and take away all paper currency 
@_date: 2017-10-12 05:18:42
I read you can get one for 10-15k plus space rental 
I wonder how fast the pay back is... fees on these are high but it's a pretty high level of anonymity

Are you drunk ?
 He literally calls it out, when asked directly for a good example of a bubble
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:59:49
Why wouldn’t it be worth atleast $60k? A trillion market cap is realistic at this point, especially when 401k Money comes flooding in
@_date: 2017-09-17 15:46:52
You purchased a security that increased in value, then sold or traded that security for more then what it was worth in dollars
You are now the IRS bitch
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:14:42
Why would fork chains not copy the amount of coins you have?? Doesn’t that give miners incentive to switch over 
@_date: 2017-10-20 21:26:16
Old rich white dudes are rich for a reason, it’s not because they are dumb. When you are older you can’t take as much risk

@_date: 2017-10-16 19:16:11
Yeah I mean all those bastards buying stuff from Silk Road 
could have bought a house but They just wanted some weed and e .. 
Not to mention all the drug dealers, I imagine some got arrested during the crackdown and hopefully hid their btc and will come out very rich 
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:05:34
Do you honestly believe that? Don’t fucking kid yourself 
Show me some proof that most “rich people” weren’t born rich

Right there with ya buddy - the most expensive drugs I’ll ever do lol
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:02:21
Yeah but that’s not how it’s going to grow Man. Be realistic 
Let’s say we get to a market cap of a trillion in five years that’s realistic if 401k Money starts pumping in. Even then it’s not close to a million dollars 
@_date: 2017-05-26 14:57:54

I also have a trex, you see I modified chickens genetic code and slowly over time they turned back into trex 
The process was tough. I had done this all by 18
Then I fucked Scarlett Johansson and flew my bitcoin powdered rocket ship to Elon musks moon base 
Everything's true. I got the equipment from the dark net

It's flattering a DNM pioneer would come and openly admit that they both founded and moderated sites 
that sold drugs and potentially hired a hitman; it's also ridiculous to think someone would openly admit that. 
Personally I believe you can find anything if you know what your doing and know the right people 
also I think if you just go to alpha bay and order an assassin you'll go to prison 
But who knows. Maybe you really are DPR and over the last 7 years you grew some huge nuts
