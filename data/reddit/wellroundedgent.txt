Really well written. This could apply to a lot more than the financial system, too.

Under the guise of a pre-order, yes. But if things like Kickstarter have taught us anything, there's built in risk to projects like these. Part of that risk is delays (sometimes excessive). 
This is one reason pre-orders shouldn't take money, but rather a waiting list or "charge on ship." The second you fail to deliver on a promise, you look like a criminal (which I'd imagine in the majority of cases is unnecessary).
Might be worth reaching out to the founders personally requesting a blog post/email to those w/ pre-orders.

Because, relevance.

Honest question. 
How can we help to avoid this with others as bitcoin approaches the mainstream? I can see a lot of people doing what this guy did and being totally oblivious as to why it's bad. And subsequently, blaming bitcoin for being insecure/flawed/etc.
Is it an education problem or just an asshole not paying attention?

This is fucking awesome news. I use Stripe for all of my apps that need payments. The second this goes live I'll be adding it :)

This should be the top comment. Not a conspiracy, just two dudes trying to build a technical hardware business. Expect delays and then some.

This is almost a one for one ripoff of this:  which was announced two weeks ago. You changed the colors and the font size. 
Not cool.

Ah. Posting from an app so can't see any rules. Still, good advice that people should consider.

Read between the lines. 
It's not about BTC, it's about investing. What he says applies to the recent panic selling and doubt coming from the media.
