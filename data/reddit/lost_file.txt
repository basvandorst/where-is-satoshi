Imagine what other organizations are using to analyze the blockchain...
@_date: 2015-06-11 05:42:54
Is it bugs or scalability issues?
@_date: 2015-06-11 06:13:23
I went to check my balance on changetip. I've received tips from you twice during your give aways.
This story hits home. I hope this inspires others to join what really is a revolution.
323 bits for greatness

Thanks mate :)
@_date: 2015-06-06 07:18:43
Personally I think it's a matter of bandwidth.
I'm still waiting for a "blockchain seller" to appear.
@_date: 2015-06-06 07:20:19
This is why services like WesternUnion are useful. They keep us "safe" to some degree.
@_date: 2015-06-08 03:47:27
I see this all the time too with NO explanation. Until I see evidence that people are being stolen from, fuck the haters.
Yes there was that one time they messed up an algorithm to generate wallets. Shit happens people. Shit also happens when your hard drive with your bitcoin wallet gets destroyed accidentally by some idiot kicking your computer or your house burns down.
@_date: 2015-06-07 01:37:49
I see this all the time. Why? I've been with Blockchain.info for 2 years now. Not a single issue.
@_date: 2014-11-13 18:48:25
We need to establish how much 1 BTC is worth then. How much BTC for a pizza, for example? How many carrots can I buy for 1 BTC?
I think this is the biggest problem. Currently we're using the US dollar as a means of establishing a value to BTC. Would we continue doing that?
@_date: 2014-11-14 18:15:07
Exactly. People can have 100 wallets! It is near impossible to keep up with what will be going on in the blockchain. 
And not only that, but there will be ways to do anonymous transactions in the future without a 3rd party.

A Moronic, Moronic Monday worry-er: Why is BTC 316 ;_;
@_date: 2015-01-02 15:28:40
Just wondering, how did Bitcoin explode from $250 to $1200 that one time? How does something like that happen? I can't see anything that could make it rise that high again, unless gas stations or grocery stories start taking bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:08:59
Get some more pictures!

Ah, ok. Thank you for your input :)

What are some secure nodejs modules developers can use for using Bitcoin in their applications?

I don't know man red's been showing up all night.

The car is used by then :/. If was still brand new why not? We are talking zero wear and tear.
@_date: 2015-01-05 05:02:17
Well, whatever we decide stable is.
@_date: 2016-01-09 01:25:28
It's a pattern that always happens, like a bot is gaming the system. Every day there is a giant spike in volume. Every day I see green and red "walls", as if to control the price.
@_date: 2016-01-09 00:48:11
For anyone wondering the price is shown in CAD.

After seeing this block size problem being talked about over a year, here's what I get out of it: *People don't want to pay more electricity and more storage*.
Well folks, you've got to spend money to make money. Long gone are the days where setting up your own full node on a Raspberry pi. We're entering the big leagues.
@_date: 2016-06-12 16:39:33
Just saying, I've sold already. I bought at $742 CAD and sold at $795, because it appeared to be capping at $800 last night. Even though I've woken up to it being at $825 this morning, I'm still  happy I've sold and made a really fast $35. I don't expect the halving to affect anything, since it is so close already. Whatever effect the halving had, it's over now anyways. We should see a downward trend over the next few weeks.
@_date: 2016-06-01 22:50:37
So today [UNU did an AMA]( and it was pretty cool to learn this way of predicting is fairly accurate.
I think it would be cool to try and see what our hive mind thinks about Bitcoin prices. Inparticular, I want to see what everyone thinks when the Bitcoin halving happens.
The UNU site is open from 8pm to 12pm EST (no idea why they have this restriction), so see you all then!
I think something like this would be effective if it was stickied for a few hours so everyone can see it.
@_date: 2017-08-13 18:11:31
Sia will go back to 600 satoshi. Just wait and see in a few months.
I think OP actually did a good thing. He will see green all over when the Bitcoin investors start off loading to the Altcoin world.
@_date: 2017-01-11 18:21:35
Yep, and that's why I'm going to buy again very soon. We now see we can reach natural $1,000 highs. We're at $700 now. If you buy now and hold until next January, you WILL profit. The only way you wouldn't is if exchanges started to get hacked left and right.
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:30:23
You want to know why? Because Siacoin is overall solid. Tell me why isn't.
Sia hit 800+ satoshi 3 months ago. The fall is only because of this Bitcoin run. The money will flow the other way.
Sia is even designed to be two-way pegged to Bitcoin eventually. This will cause it to rise even higher.

@_date: 2015-07-12 05:41:24
Yep. I too sold 32 BTC just yesterday. I'm not into Bitcoin to make money. I'm into Bitcoin for decentralized banking.
@_date: 2015-07-12 09:14:15
Because I needed to pay tuition! :) My entire tuition has been paid using Bitcoin (in-directly...but still!).
@_date: 2015-07-20 00:43:27
I thought that was step 2!
@_date: 2015-07-18 07:30:48
Was this issue resolved?
@_date: 2015-07-11 04:54:58
Yep. That's why I've given up on Bitcoin as a currency, but absolutely think it has a chance as a *medium*. Like how Paypal is a medium (but also a wanna-be bank...). The volatility of Bitcoin is and always will be all over the place, just like anything else over time really...
EDIT: Yeah, downvote me because I speak my mind.

Free software is one reason why we have Bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-04-07 02:53:31
Just a quick question and not targetted solely at you - can't a transaction happen between two bitcoin nodes, and tell them not to broadcast until X days/hours, and is thus a "private" transaction? Eventually people need to know you own that money. I think the next step would be to maybe use a mixer to truly privatize/anonymize the transaction though.
@_date: 2015-11-05 06:46:07
Some people don't understand what a bull trap is, so adding "don't buy" will hopefully encourage someone to click on the damn image to intuitively understand what I'm getting at
@_date: 2015-11-05 04:03:48
For once in my Bitcoin life, I wanted to buy, but I didn't. I've finally learned to not be sucked into the surge hype. It was hard I'm glad I'm over that phase.
@_date: 2015-11-05 06:45:16
That's exactly why I posted this. It looks EXACTLY LIKE IT
And yeah it was a short bubble, thanks to the auction.
@_date: 2015-03-04 08:12:42
Most exchanges require that. Do it with one trusted seller and you're good to go!
@_date: 2015-03-24 21:03:11
Never used changetip before. Maybe this will get me to use it.
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:50:03
What isn't? Look, the bubble just burst and we are stabilizing already.
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:28:34
I welcome the burst. Because then we have the rise again.
@_date: 2015-03-04 00:48:45
Localbitcoins and trusted traders are all we need.
@_date: 2016-05-16 16:16:51
Lets get some experts up in here and start asking the real question:
buy or sell?

Way to go BTC-e! This looks really good for the community as a whole. I think many people are missing that point.

Thank you! I will pass on the sacred 123 bits.

Well if you change sellers yeah that'll happen. X)
@_date: 2016-05-19 21:24:33
Those are just whole "coins".  Honestly, coins are not even a thing. We should stop calling them that.
There is WAY more than 7 billion individual pieces that Bitcoin currency can be broken up into. 0.001 of a "Bitcoin" could be worth thousands.
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:19:27
We have seen -$800 in a matter of hours, only for it to restablize.
What is happening is adoption.
