The american dollar is already pretty much the fed coin. Why would a country create a "fed coin" It's silly. Each country will have it's own currency, with 1 currency always being the ruler of the world. Every country is in completion with each other. Countries and presidents don't want to work together, they each have dreams of being the  ruler of the world. 
Governments are looking at the blockchain but they don't know what to do with it. Because it's useless for them, they want to control us not give us freedom.
The whole point of bitcoin is to give us financial freedom. Bitcoin is such an amazing technology because it takes the power of money from governments and give it to the people. Once the governments don't control the money, there would be less wars and less immigration. 
Bitcoin is a threat to the governments and creating their own fed coin will do nothing for them. 
China dreams of the yuan being the world reserve. But it won't happen. People are starting to wake up that we can't trust any country, anyone or any bank, we must find another way to stop banks and governments from controlling our finances. It's time for us to take responsibily for our own money. With the invention of the internet we are not able to take control of our own money and no longer need third parties. 
At the moment bitcoin seems like the only way to give us financial freedom.
Trump doesn't care about bitcoin or crypto-currencies, He cares that America stays on the right path and continues to be the most powerful country in terms of military and economic power. 
He knows that China is on its way to becoming more powerful than america. 
In this monetary system, Not every country can have money and power. It's only one. It's either the usa or china, and with military power you can push countries around and do what you want. Which is what america has been doing for years.  
I am on bitcoin's side, This will bring freedom to everyone, But currently in this monetary system i am on the u.s. side, i would rather be rich then poor. The system is so corrupt. 
He who holds the money, holds the power.

he's completely right, that's exactly what happened to me.. it took a while to figure out bitcoin, several months in fact, and i thought it was stupid at first, as it is very complicated to understand and use, but once i started using it and understanding it, it clicked and i realized how powerful the bitcoin technology is, its going to be huge and it hasn't even hit mainstream,  luckily now 2017 it is getting easier and easier to use, it won't be mainstream until grandma and grandpa can use it easily, and the rest of the sheep, 
a currency not linked to governments..
sending money without questions or id to anywhere around the world in matter of seconds... "click"
its going to be HUGE

for the past 2 years i've been slowing buying mbits, and every time i'm about to click "purchase" on coinbase, i say to myself, this is crazy it's so expensive, i'm not sure if i should buy it, but then i by them...
and here i am after 2 years, it keeps climbing and climbing.. it never stops... i have never made a loss..  i am still thinking, this is so crazy,
well.. time to go shopping on new egg again...
in fact, i've developed a habit... i buy as much as i can every month so i can spend the same amount i bought 3 months later, 
this is great actually, i am purchasing things on a discount,  5 bucks here, 10 bucks here, my monthly bills have been lowered because bitcoin keeps raising every month, 
i will keep buying bitcoin every month in advance for next month's bill,
long live bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-02-19 19:19:39
I don't see the point of this fed coin.  You can already see everything, everywhere with the american dollar. The only problem is that cash is still around, and that's the only way to hide money and they can't control it.  
The only thing they have to do, is get rid of cash and then they will have complete control and be able to see every transaction everywhere. Because once you get rid of cash, poor people will have no choice but to get a bank account. The american dollar is already pretty much a digital currency. 
So really, why would they issue a whole new currencly, it's much easier to just ban cash and continue on with the american dollar. 
I'm sure the federal reserve wants 1 currency for the world, which they have complete control of, But with the internet it's going to become almost impossible.  
With 176 countries in the world, it's hard for one organization to control the world. Like i said, countries are in competition against each other, they don't want to work with each other, want to be number 1, and have all the money and power. 
I am amazed at bitcoin and what potential it has.  Someday borders will be broken. we will be free to live and work anywhere we want. 
Because the only thing right now that is keeping us from living and working anywhere we want is... governments..
We will succeed in 4 steps. 
 Unlimited knowledge at the tip of our hands. Which we have.
The internet is one of the greatest invention in the history of mankind. 
 Financial freedom from banks and governments. 
We don't have yet, but it could be bitcoin or another crypto-currency.  Once thing is for sure, Bitcoin ain't going away. 
 High Speed Mass Transportation
Once we have this, borders will no longer be needed. (Teleportation or close to that speed)
 Of grid, Energy.
Then we can truly live anywhere in the world, even in remote areas. 
To end this:
Governments are needed, at this current moment, but they will slowly and slowly be less needed.  
Governments have killed millions throughout mankind's history, They have always tried to control us, but they will never succeed, 
It is our destiny to be free and explore the universe. 
We will win, without ever shooting any bullets because we now have knowledge and the internet. 
The internet has brought us freedom and knowledge. 
Knowledge...this is our weapon.
The future looks bright!

theonethatownz is right,  
for myself , i use an old computer which i keep my wallet.dat there,  that's all that is on the windows computer, a folder named bitcoin with my wallet.dat inside,  it's never been connected to the internet, so no way for anyone to steal it, they would physically have to come into my home and steal the computer,  i have 2 hard drives in it, so 2 copies of the wallet.dat file, in case 1 hard drive stops working,  
i should probably check it, i haven’t turned on the computer for months
when i want to send money to it, i just send it from my coinbase account, to the address,  
theres no need to turn on the computer or ever touch it, until i want spend it, but its only 1 bitcoin and i saving it until i'm 70
my main laptop has the bitcoin core application for normal spending bitcoins which is always online, but i only keep 100 bucks on it, and spend it,
never keep too much bitcoins on your main computer in case you download a virus and steals your bitcoins,  im not worried, i don't click on unknown links, just browse normally
bitcoin is great if you are responsible and smart online,
taking care of your own money is a big job, and lots of responsibly,
it's not good for the masses, most people are horrible with money and computers, it's something they have to learn and grow up,
we have 2 choices, 
let the big bad banks take care of our money
or take control of your own money, 
i choose to take care of my own money

open bazaar is great!  I've only heard about it 2 months ago. I've been using it. Since my paypal account was banned, i can't use ebay. 
I haven't bought anything from there yet. Since there isn't alot on there yet, I'm looking everyday. I really want to purchase something there to see what it's like.
I will start using open bazaar to sell things, it's with bitcoin so it's perfect
It's going to be huge once more and more people hear about it. 
I already see people selling cash for bitcoin, or selling bitcoin for cash.
It's going to be perfect. decentralized!
@_date: 2017-02-22 01:22:21
absolutely, our currency is slowly being devaluated, 
i hold some in cold storage for the future, 
and then i purchase 1,000 worth every month, so in 2 months it will be worth more, then spend it on my bills,  so really i'm saving money every month, as long as bitcoin keeps climbing, some months it hasn't so i just wait next month, seems to be working so far, i am poor so i must do whatever i can to save even a couple dollars every month, because the banks don't reward me for saving money
 bitcoin is helping me achieve this
@_date: 2017-02-28 00:07:58
stick with coinbase, i started buying 20 dollars worth here and there, afterwards when my limit was increased to 1000, i bought 1000 dollars worth in one shot,  i've never had a problem, 
but one thing is for sure, right after i buy it, i quickly send it to my offline wallet, i've never kept bitcoins on coinbase for more than 1 hour
@_date: 2017-02-12 22:49:06
Paypal is great! If it wasn't for them, i would've never gotten into bitcoin.  
I was also banned by them 2 years ago, I was devastated, They didn't even give me a second chance from a small mistake i made. I was amazed at the power they had, it tried for months to find an alternative and there was none. It was ridiculous how hard it is to transfer money oversears to someone in another country. 
Over 200 countries, no chance all banks will work together and get cheap overseas transfer.. 
Then i found Bitcoin... and my eyes were opened.. to the power of this technology.. so i say
Thank you Paypal..

I love watching his videos. They are very educational. 
Mike is a good and smart man. I respect him. I thought about buying gold 2 years ago. But i found buying gold was difficult and not only that it was hard to know if i was buying real gold, and even worse yes it's true that the government and someone could steal it from your home since it's not easy to hide and....
I can't really buy things with gold, such as computers, food... well i can but it's complicated and expensive and buy little things with it. 
Gold was good before the internet.. because there was no other choice but now... we have a choice and it's called bitcoin.
But bitcoin is way better than gold, in so many ways.  
Don't get me wrong, gold is still good if you don't have any other choice, but i believe gold is on it's way out.
I keep some bitcoins offline and transfer a bit on my laptop when i want to spend a bit.  Bitcoin is very convenient!  You can't do that with gold. 
Technology will replace most things... gold-bugs won't see it coming.. 
Long live Bitcoin!

it won't affect it much, there is millions of people wanting to purchase bitcoins, and many more new users arriving every day
everyone wants to become rich, or at least make some good money,
and as fiat becomes worth less, more and more people will start coming in,  
bitcoin is not going away anytime soon, it's going to keep going up and up
it's slowly making people richer and richer,  you must remember, everyone has a price, as soon as it hits someone's price.. they sell and hundreds of people waiting to pick it up from him, but since the price is high, not everyone can afford 1 bitcoin anymore, 
as economies get worse, those really rich people who hide money in offshore banks, will try to find an easy way to keep the value of their hidden money, and since all fiat is becoming worthless, they won't have a choice but to store it in bitcoin, because gold is physical and not easy to buy or hide,
the problem they will have is that as bitcoin is becoming more expensive and expensive, rich people will fight over bitcoin, with some offering out outrageous prices.
think about it... when fiat starts to crumble, and you have millions of money stored in offshore banks, 
what do you do?  watch your money fade away? since you can't change it for gold, or buy real estate because it's hidden money from the government
you might as well convert it to bitcoin, at least you won't loose everything,  plus bitcoin can easily be stored on a usb and no longer overseas in some offshore bank,  no one will ever know
people are starting to wake up,
the longer we hold, they higher the price will go
eventually when those rich bastards start to realize their fiat money is becoming worthless, you can sell a little bit of your bitcoin for some fiat, and quickly purchase a house, car, physical items
physical items are the key,    take back our wealth
remember.. there is BILLIONS &amp; BILLONS hidden in offshore banks by the, elite, politicians, rich people and bankers
they hord fiat money, just like we are hording bitcoin
when shit hits the fan..
that stolen money will eventually have to go somewhere else other than offshore banks...
bitcoin is genious...   
just remember.. NEVER sell ALL your bitcoin

no argument found in this conversation..
it's good he knows.. most people who work in banks don't know, its just a job for them
i work the financial industry too, and i love bitcoin, even if it costs me my job, i support bitcoin, because it's not about me, this is about bringing finical freedom to billions around the world
im sure he'll call you eventually when he wants to buy bitcoin, or when bitcoin takes over and you have a lot of money,
no one i know believes in bitcoin, they think it's weird illegal money and don't understand it
what is great about the internet, is that it's getting easier to find people with the same beliefs and gaining knowledge together, 
just think before the internet.. we had no choice but to talk to our next door neighbour, now.. we no longer have to socialize with people we don't like
as soon as super high speed mass transportation comes in effect, we will no longer need to socialize via the internet as much, we can socialize in person, 
this is what people always say... that young people are always stuck to their phones...
it's because we don't want to talk to people around us.. it turns out the people who we get along with and have lots in common are all around the world, spread out
internet is our freedom

nothing.. because i chickened out on trading..
my orignal plan was to buy 1 bitcoin and put it on karken and sell high, then re-buy when it's lower,  
but the problem is, i think bitcoin is going to keep going up and up.. so im starting to think trading is not really worth it, i'll make a few bucks here and there, but i think im better off if i keep holding, i believe in bitcoin, and think its going to keep raising and rasing, 
@_date: 2017-03-16 02:19:48
absolutely, and there has not been anything anyone can do for years, they have always been to big to take on for years, 
Funny thing, i've never paid any fees in around the 20 years i've been with them, i've always kept a certain amount of money in my bank to bypass the fees, and in fact, i've never had any problem with the banks, they have pretty good service, 
They have atms and banks everywhere, the online service is great,
I feel sorry for the majority of canadians, they don't have much money in the bank and the fees are high if you don't keep a certain amount of money in the bank,
they do lend out money often to people who shouldn’t have it,  they are the ones pretty much ruining the economy and the reason for the housing prices so high, the reason people don't value money anymore, and the reason people don't know how to work hard for their money
they have haven't really done anything for me as a saver, i've saved money in the past but the % of interest is not even worth it
the only people really benefiting are the 1% who probably don't even live in canada, in fact when canadian children can't even afford housing anymore, it's not really benefiting anyone in canada
canada is not really that great of a country as people claim it is, 
I'm glad we are seeing alternatives, i'm glad i'm slowly moving my savings into bitcoin, 
the fact that no one can see how much money i have in my bitcoin wallet. and the fact that no bank can make money from my money,  
it's revolutionary,
we are very lucky to understand computers more then the mainstream people,  we are the ones who are going to earn the most profit from bitcoin,
everytime i walk into the bank, which isn't often, i always see old people paying bills, and labours cashing check, 
those are the people who won't profit as much from bitcoin, i highly doubt they will ever understand bitcoin as us, those are the people that that bank can easily exploit, 
for them to use bitcoin, the developers have to make it as simple or even more simple than banking, 
that is the only way mainstream people will ever move to bitcoin,  and when they do, they will have financial freedom, and there grandchildren won't ever have to use a bank ever again,
we are just at the beginning of bitcoin, these current prices (1261usd) is nothing compared to what's coming in the future

1. . . . PC Financial, Tangerine, and to an extent other banks offer accounts with no fee banking; especially for youth and students. So provided they have access to the internet or live near a city like the majority of Canadians, it's not an issue.
"to an extent"... the hidden fine print 
"especially for youth and students" ... guess what, not everyone is a youth or student
Hey, guess what, Tangerine is owned by Scotia Bank,
Hey, guess what, Bitcoin doesn't care whether you or not you are a student or youth, bitcoin is open to everyone
Hey guess what, ever tried opening a bank account as a youth or student? can't open one unless you submit identification, 
2. You don't save money, the only reason you should have a fat savings account is if you're new to the country or you've yet to set up a proper investment vehicle. Investing is the best way to keep that cash safe from the taxman and more fees. Just setting up a TSFA or RRSP is a huge plus, which by the way, have no fees, no tax, and you can open up more than one at multiple banks. 
ha! you don't save money? looks the the big banks have gotten inside your mind, and brainwashed you like all the other sheep. That's exactly what they want you to do, not save money.   Hate to break it you to, you should always save money. Guess your parents didn't raise you right,
The only reason why people invest is because the banks don't give you a high enough interest on your savings. You think people would invest if the bank paid you a decent savings %. Most likely not, Investing is very risky on the stock market, the average person doesn't have time for that. And RRSP and TSFA are still a big rip off. Guess what happens if you need the money down the road?  Opps! you must ask permission from the bank to take out the money.   
Open more than one at multiple banks? Hey Eisenstein. are you forgetting, you can only put so much money into the TSFA's, that's altogether from all banks, and if you put more by mistake? they tax you!
3. Did I miss the "Make Canada Great Again" parade? Never heard anyone say this.
Of course, because canadians just shut their mouths and take it up their ass, we pay some of the highest fees for telecommunications, the banks are taking advantage of us, Refugees are getting a free ride, Foreigners are allowed to buy up our real estaste.   Such as great place eh?
 
4. Again... Wow. You're really riding the high horse aren't ya bud. And didn't you say earlier there are online options? It's almost as if most folks do that than say walk into a bank.
You talk as if you care for the poor folks who use banks, then you slander them for being too stupid to understand bitcoin and how ultimately it'll be your profit. That's not very Satoshi of you.
Of course they are stupid, they gre up sitting in front of their tv being brainwashed by all that american garbage down south,
Like you said yourself, "You should only have savings if you are new to the country" they are native born, so most likely they are broke. 
5. The banks in Canada suck, I'm not denying that. But they are better than most and if you play the system you'd be surprised how many loopholes there are. There's a reason why Canada is listed alongside other tax havens.
Better than most? So that explains your standards, as long as they are better than most, you are quite happy. Quite happy letting the banks steal your money, Quite happy not saving money, Quite happy ... you have very low standards, 
And why is Canada a good tax haven? Because people all over the world and in canada, are tired of paying taxes for their hard earned money, guess where the taxes go... war.. and the pockets of bankers. 
But that is ok with you, because the banks are better than most banks, 
hey sally! wake up. go off the tv and start informing yourself. 
I for one, am tired of the banks making money of my money, 
You ever wonder what would happen to the banks if everyone kept their money underneath the mattress?
Start doing some research.

i am in the same situation, we are safe don't worry, We have the power, since those wallets never touched the internet
some people are talking about selling their BTU's fo BTC's, in order to do that, you would have to upload your wallet.dat to the new BTU application and then sell that way. It's seems great that you could double your btc's by selling your new btu's, 
but, it's very risky, and we don't know what inside this new application, i would stay away from BTU
stick with the core and leave your bitcoins in cold storage where they are safe,

Ok you are correct. Saying it the way i said it, is probably way is too harsh. 
I retract my statement. Instead i should say "hopefully what happened, will help them open their eyes to what is going on and do more research on what type of company they are investing in" 
I do find, the majority of average people, invest in the stock market just because that is the only way to make some money in the long term, so they have have enough to retire, 
It's sad to see people buying homes as an investment, buying stocks as in investment, because they don't have pensions, and the banks don't give them enough interest, in the end it's the average person that gets hurts, 
but i do feel, bad things have to happen for people to open their eyes and see what's going on, 
I don't see the point of banks using the blockchain, if i put myself in the eyes of the banking cartels, i can't seem to find any good use for the blockchain, as a mechanism to control money and steal from us,  The current banking system is doing a great job of stealing from the poor, they just need to get rid of cash, and they will have complete control, once they crash the economy, they just reset the money system, and people once again they have to apply for mortgages, and start all over again, it's like a never ending circle, which happens often throughout history,  so i really don't see the point of the blockchain for controlling people, 
@_date: 2017-03-12 19:31:23
you miss understood what i meant.. i will explain,
It's 2017, we are more connected then we were in the past, family and friends are working all over the world, then in the past, 
people are no longer living and working in the same city as their friends or family, they go where there is work,  so most times visiting is out of the question, especially when flights are expensive, 
seeing your family on social media is the only option we have, we can't see family when we talk to them over the phone, yes its fine to call them but you cant see photos or see what they are doing on the phone, 
social media is great, it has brought family together again, who are not able to be together because of work issues, 
So what are we supposed to do?  stop using facebook and live in a cave?  no we can't,
everyday we are realizing  more and more that the governments are taking advantage of our social media, just because they can do this, doesn't mean we should stop using it, it means we are now aware and we can find a solution, to stop using completely is not a solution
it's like saying, since the government keeps printing money, lets go return to bartering,
no, we can't, that's not moving forward, that's moving backwards, 
we continue to use their money and find a solution, luckily for us, we now have a solution, to use bitcoin, and thats moving forward

many copies of your wallet, in the country you are leaving from,  example:
i am from america, 
i go to russia on vacation with my laptop, and a usb, i keep a copy of my re-named wallet.dat on both my laptop and usb,   
if it happens that the russian agents keep my wallet and usb during the border crossing,  that's okay because i also have a copy of my wallet.dat back in my home country on another usb
i just have to wait until i return back to my home country to pick up my usb
what if the russian agents find my re-named wallet.dat?
well if it's encyrpted, then they must break your password,  that gives you time to fly back home and recover your saved wallet.dat and transfer it to a new address,
its important to have a difficult password,  not an easy password, because they could be broken fast before you could fly back home, 
this is pretty extreme, i don't think that could happen, but better safe than sorry,
always have a password for your wallet.dat, password on your computer, and password on your usb
i've crossed borders with my laptop and never had any problem, just dont keep any bitcoin stickers or wear a bitcoin t-shirt, don't let anyone know you have bitcoin,
i wouldnt trust to keep it online, or email, so offline is the best way,
even those mini sd cards you can sew a secret pocket, or un-sew a part of your pants and put it there,
i've forgot to empty out my pockets once and there was fiat money and a mini sd card in my pocket, 
and that big scanner didn't go off,  
this is why i think bitcoin is going to be huge,    
transfers million of dollars in seconds to anyone in the world....
or... walk accross any border with milllions of bitcoin on a cellphone without anyone ever knowing
speaking of millions..  i wish i knew about bitcoin earlier.. i would've been a millionaire..  i can't get over this.. it makes me mad thinking about it

all the holders are hogging all the bitcoins as soon as it goes down, they quickly buy more,

its funny, it's very unlikely bitcoin will drop back to the 200's, as soon as sellers drop, there’s thousands of people waiting to purchase them at a cheaper price, i'm one of them, been purchasing them on every drop, aside from my normal monthly purchase
gonna purchase myself a cheap flight at the end of the year, then start again next year,

pushing that aside, i do like alot of his videos about the economy, yes he is correct in many things, 
when the dollar does crash, people will run to bitcoin first because it's easier to hold and purchase and hide, and second people will run to gold
so gold is not completely out,
for myself, i'll stick with bitcoin, i doubt i'll ever buy gold, it's too 1990's

1. So its owned by a bank?... And? PC Financial is owned by CIBC... They diversified thier service, welcome to the free market. Guess what, it doesn't bother me. Open to everyone? Even if I don't have internet? Wow what a feat, it must be just like cash then!
 -- diversified their service? that's what the sheep are calling it?  hey sally! it's the same bank, time to wake up
2. I'm brainwashed? You sound like you just drank a litre of kool aid dude. I save via investing, interest rates suck when you just leave your cash in a bank and grow it by working and or other "favors". Do it right and your wealth grows. My parents raised me to keep a level head about finances... dumping my savings into a volatile internet "dollary doo" isn't a wise course of action long term.
--of course they suck, the reason they don't give you any high interest rates is because they want you to invest, the average person does not know how to invest, so they end up losing most of their money. Obviously, they didn't teach you how the monetary works.
By calling bitcoin "dollary doo" goes to show you don't know much about how bitcoin works. I doubt you even know much about investing. 
3. As for your hilarious TSFA rant, I don't expect you to know to know much about them given your obvious bias.
--I know much more about finance then yourself.
Considering you said "Too bad it takes an hour or more to actually use and the fees now make Western Union look cheap" in one of your posts says everything about you. You have obviously never used bitcoin or even western union. You should try researching how much western union actually is. 
4. LOL, well that escalated quickly. BTW, its "estate" not "estaste".
--I wouldn't be surprised if your husband supports you. That's probably where you get your investments from. 
5. LOL, seriously are you a Loony Toon reject?
--Loony Toons? Is that what you grew up on? That was how your parents taugh you finance, i bet.
6. Actually its Sandra, and I don't own a TV all my money is in the bank remember?
-- Are you forgetting you grew up on Loony Toons? Obviously you own a tv, that's how you will raise your children, Sally.
7. That's how banks work bro. Its worked for a long time and if you think some magical internet money is going to dethrone it you've really fallen off the deep end. I used to think like you, then I started talking to people out in the real world who never used bitcoin... guess what, they don't care. Well thats not true, they care when I tell them about how they can buy drugs online and maybe a LED fleshlight.
--You have never thought the same as me. I can guarantee you. 
bahahahahahahha this is the funniest post ever. Talking to people out in the real world who never used bitcoin? That's where you belong, with those type of people who grow up on loony toons and watch justin beeiber. They don't care? I bet you didn't know that. You don't have to talk to them to even know they don't care. 
Hey Sally, typewriters worked for a long time, I bet you still use one. How did you ever learn to use a computer. Is your husband typing for you?
8. Feel free to suff your tear stained mattress with dollars. I hope you have good fire prevention and some damn good home security... Ah wait you put it all in bitcoin didn't you! Clever man, gee whiz I wish I had that kind of financial sense, all my money wrapped up in volatility... ahh well, a man can dream.
--Is this all you got? Sounds like a little girl crying. 
9. You know what, that's the only thing I can agree with you on... Start doing some research. Great advice!
-- Wow, you actually agree with something, Well i'm glad i got into your head a tiny bit. I'm glad you will be doing some research. Good for you Sally.

there's not need for market crashes, the only reason there is, is because this is an easy way for the banking cartels to steal your money after the economy crashes, you have to start saving money again and get a mortgage all over again. It's a planned event. 
you still have a house?  tell that to the millions of americans who lost their home due to not being able to pay the mortgage, and the other millions of americans who simply stopped paying mortgages because it was cheaper to delcare bankruptcy,  sell your home? good luck trying to sell it when everyone is trying to sell it, did you not read what happened during the 2008 crisis? 
the standard of living is high because it's very easy to get mortgage, and get loans, Americans want big homes! big cars! but they don't want to work and save for it. They want everything now! All they have to do is get a loan, The banks don't care, they make money from giving out loans, they will eventually make the economy crash,  Who does this hurt the most? the people who save money
With limited resources? We actually have lots of resources for everyone in the world,  but the rich countries steal them, what for? so they can have Big Homes! Big Cars! Big Meals!  and how do they buy these big things? loans! and credit cards!
If people actually had to pay from their pockets to support the iraq war, and i'm not taking about taxes, i'm taking about actually taking out cash, and giving it to someone to support the war, would i?
hell no you wouldnt!  very few people would, i much rather spend my money on a service or product, then support the military, it would benefit everyone in the long run, 
wars benefit only a few people, not eve the soldiers, look how many american soliders committed suicide, they are young and stupid 19 year old kids, they think war is cool from all the garbage on tv, talk to some Vietnam veterans and hear what they thought about it when they were young compared to their age now
There is trillions hidden in offshore banks, why doesn't it trickle down? because in order to spend it, governments would find out who is hiding the money, and they want to tax them, tax them to keep supporting their useless wars and politicians pensions, 
People don't want to pay taxes because they don't want to keep supporting the governments incompetent work force. You really don't need much taxes to support basic services,
Health care? well when you keep feeding your citizens garbage such as mcdonalds, they are going to be fat and lazy
Once you remove the control of money from governments, then people have much more incentives to spend their money, since they are in control if their own money, they will spend it on useful things, such as services which will pass the money to others, no one will want to fund a war, especially when you can't print more bitcoins, you will run out of bitconis in no time, running a military is expensive,
Bitcoin isn't going to end all wars, but it's going to make it hell expensive to support one,

i've been holding for almost 2 years, i could sell now for a huge profit but when i think about it, i don't need the money and i'm not sure what i would do with all that money, if i took it out i would most likely keep it in fiat money, and i wouldn't get much % anyways, so i might as well keep it in bitcoins, 
i was thinking that too, i think eventually people would finally sell, considering most people have families too feed, i only have myself to feed

from that website, very little people own 21 bitcoins, of course unless they spread it in multiple wallets, i guess we will never know, 
bitcoin is so powerful it amazes me the way it works, the fact that we can't print any more bitcoins past 21 million is amazing, and the fact that we can see every transaction in real time is amazing, the fact that it is slowly spreading the wealth, the fact that beginners of bitcoins became millionaires is amazing, 
this is how fiat money is supposed to work, we are supposed to see how much fiat money is out there in real time, with no one interfering &amp; printing money, 
but since we can't see what is going on with fiat money, governments can do that why want, and since every government can print  money, everyone is scared and has to build up their military, every country is scared of each other, 
the concept behind bitcoin is truly revolutionary, a one world currency were the people control the money and are able to see every transaction with no secrets,  
it's almost like an open source money system, where we can see eveything without knowing who actually owns the money
even if bitcoin fails which i think it won't, the whole blockchain system is not going away, this is an amazing technology
open source is the future, we need to get rid of these intelligence agencies, taking their power of money is the only way to destroy them,
i've never understood open-source, and i am realizing everyday that is the way to go, we can't trust closed source companies anymore

i like open bazaar, i use it to sell and buy things, the concept is great, i see people selling all kinds of things that normally wouldn't be on ebay. the fact that no one can tell you what you can and cannot sell is a huge win for freedom
i've never had a problem with ebay, and i buy tons of things from ebay, but i can\t sell from ebay due to the fact i don't have a paypal account, 
open bazaar is going to beat ebay eventually, it's alot more powerful, thanks to the open bazaar team 
selling anonymous is going to make it even better,  the war against drugs can go fuck themselves, 
the future is looking bright, take the power of money and power of selling from governments, and give it back to humans, the economy is going to progress in huge numbers,

i bought a couple bitcoins when it was around 300, and every time it went up or down, was like riding a roller coaster. I always felt like taking it out, but the more i understood bitcoin the more i liked it, eventually after a long time it went way up past 300, and now if it goes up or down a lot, i doesn't matter because i've never sold my bitcoins, so the + or - 50% it goes up or down doesn't matter, im way up above 300
the point is, you should hold, bitcoin goes up and down often, eventually you will be up higher than what it is now that it won't matter, and you won't notice the price, i still buy a little bit every month, i believe bitcoin will keep going up and up for years to come

ha! one of the richest countries in the world? are you kidding! people here can barely afford their homes, they barely have any money in their bank, and when they reach their retirement age, they don't have enough money to retire, of course, let's not forget that most likely in someones life, there will be a market crash or housing crash, whoops! all your money gone, poof! this is all planned by the banking system.
you call that rich? You must be taking about people who work in government, they are the only ones with pensions and politicians,  but that must not matter to you, 
one of the richest countries in the world? from killing people overseas, stealing their oil and surveillance on  people, they have bases everywhere in the world. 
I understand a military is needed in this time, but the greatest advantage that the american militarty has is that they can print money, so you are right unless every economy is in sync, it's not possible for one country to not have a militarty, because there will always be one country who can print money and attack another country, 
But i believe if we had 1 currency for the world, which was not controlled by any country, then it would be much harder for any government to start a war, because they would somehow have to get money from the people, And when its your own money going to war, 99% of the people would not pay to fund a war. 
At the moment we fund wars by paying taxes, but we are not directly paying for wars, the term tax is used, then the governments use it to pay for war. 
Very few people in america are rich, most are brainwashed by the system, all they do is sit in front of the tv, people are disgusting here, kids don't have any ambition, when you throw money and credit cards at people, they don't learn the value of money
Of course all the bitcoin holders would become one of the richest people in the world, at the beginning, .... at the beginning
but eventually it would spread down, and the fact that no government is able print more bitcoins, or any bank is able to make any money from your bitcoin sitting in your wallet, is powerful, there is no need for credit cards or loans, all that is, is a tool to get you in debt
You would have to eventually spend your bitcoins, to feed your family and buy a home, and various daily things,  
the fiat system would work, but they don't want it to work, its only benefits the few, and they want to keep it that way
the technology behind crytpo-currencies are the future, without governments controlling the money supply, 
we have the power

im am not completely against taxation, i do agree with you, some taxation is needed, for roads, water, etc, but not as much as current taxation rates
but america.. its insane how much money goes to the military, when there is really no invaders, 
i do say, a military is needed, but the fact most countries can print money, gives other countries advantage, so a powerful military is needed, and it's almost as if every country is on the edge, you either have a big military or get invaded,
what astonishes me, is that if we had a one world currency and no country could print money, or interfere with the money then it would be harder to support a military, there would definitely be more peace in the world, because the people would be the ones with the power, and most people would not be willing to support a war

When i was syncing i didnt have port 8333 open. I wonder if it would of helped because it took 3 weeks......  i deleted it 5 times because i thought it was stuck..  that was 2 years ago when I first started bitcoin.
Now, i always leave it running 24/7. I dont keep port 8333 open because i opened it once and it was using too much bandwidth and it slowed my connection down. I dont have a fast connection.

We still should be thankful that people are trading bitcoins for products and not only buying them and holding them,
i do both, trade for product &amp; buy to store them
if people were only holding them and not spending them, i don't think bitcoin would get far,
bitpay is helping bitcoin succed, 
in the article it says he is "proud of his place in Bitcoin history. "
as much as they are worth now, i wish that was me, it is quite a story to say that he was the first person ever in history to make the first transaction, that is quite a honor to hold, regardless of the price now
he will always be remembered in history, that to me is more important than money

i think mars would probably have use their own decentralized currency, away from bitcoin
but your question is interesting and is far past my understanding level, it would be interesting to know what would happen if bitcoin was used as the global currency on earth and  there was people living on mars as well,  in fact, what if we have people on other planets living and other galaxies,  i dont think we could transmitt internet signals through space would we? 
it would probably be like how countries are now, each have their own laws and currency, 
one thing for sure, is we are headed for a united earth with no borders

get in line, there’s thousands of people wishing/waiting for bitcoin to fall so they can keep buying more and more, 
theres a lot of money to be made when it falls, people have started to realize this, it makes too much sense to exhange fiat into bitcoin, its slowly transferring wealth back to use from the corrupt banking institutions

Excellent video.  Also we should note, that everyone always goes back to gold because that was the only choice they had every time when fiat failed. Now humans have 2 choices, when fiat collapses and it's headed that way, they will run to metals(gold and silver) and crypto currencies(bitcoin leading) . So of course people are always going to run back to gold. Now with the internet, the younger generation are a lot more skilled with computers and it will be way easier to purchase bitcoins than gold, the most important, it's way easier to spend bitcoins then spend gold. 
I looked into gold a couple years ago, but gold was too complicated. Gold is great if i want to change my fiat into gold, but the big problem comes when i want to spend it. Good luck trying to purchase a steam game using gold. Not only that, i can't tell if it is real or not. 
Gold has too many problems, i understand why gold has never actually been used as money as we got more globalized. It's too heavy, not easy divisible, and hard for average people to know if it is counterfeit. 
We've hit a jackpot wit Bitcoin, whoever created has brought one of the greatest invention since the internet. 
The average person will probably never understand bitcoin, it's complicated for them. Computers in general are complicated. We can except doctors, construction workers, mechanics to understand bitcoin. We are extremely lucky that most of us here on bitcoin reddit understand computers and im sure alot of us work in the i.t. industry. 
Like i have read before, when we tell our friends, family, co-workers, they don't understand it and they think it's silly. 
This is what is great about the internet. We are able to find people with the same thoughts and same interests. Together we will be able to change the world even if we are thousands of miles away and most likely will never meet. 
Gold will never accomplish what Bitcoin will accomplished in the upcoming years. We are living in a digitized world. It's time for a digitized currency. But not just any... The way Bitcoin works is genius. 
Even if we had decentralized teleportation, gold still would not be any good,  Gold just doesn't work. 
The days of physical money are coming to an end. Paper money would work fine if humans didn't get greedy. But we just can't trust humans with money. 
One thing is for sure, if bitcoin fails someday, people will run back to gold, that's if.. there isn't another cyrpto currency better than bitcoin. 
Gold hasn't really had any completion for thousands of years.  It was either gold or fiat. 
Technology has completely changed the world, for the better
These gold bugs are going to get hit hard weather they like it or not, just like the churches got hit hard, with the invention of the internet, we have more freedom, and more knowledge, 
knowledge is power

I sold my house 7 years ago, after having my home for not even 1 year. i quickly realized it was not worth it. I was amazed at how much interest i had to pay. I was pretty much house broke. I was realized why people had no money in the bank. All your pay check always goes to a house.  Funny thing is, everyone at work, my family, told me not to sell, and they said i was crazy for selling my home. Everyone is so obsessed with owning a home, and they only thing that they talked about was making alot of money when i sold someday. When i was young that was hard wired into my brain, to buy a home. Because that's what everyone always talks about.  
Luckily i was smarter than everyone else and quickly realized i would not be able to save much. 
Instead i invested in myself. Went on trips, bought myself toys, ate out a lot, even with all of this spending i was  able to save 50% of my income.
Guess what, i always had some money saved up in my bank. While all these home owners had 0 and their argument against me was "It doesn't matter if i don't have any savings, I could sell my home now and have thousands"
I told them they don't own the home until they pay it off, and most of their money actually goes to interest and not the principal, so really they don't have much savings"  they didn't like this and usually got angry and called me stupid. 
The majority of these people don't "need" a house, they "want" a house.
7 years later, it was the best decision i've ever made and i've never regretted it, I don't have any debt and i am up a lot of money from my savings plus what i have in bitcoin. In 5 years i'll be able to buy a home in cash.
But i won't. Because what this experience taught me is that i never "needed" a house, instead i "wanted" a house.
Congrats on selling your home and downsizing. Hang in there. It will be worth it in the end.

then i purchased half of one which i use to spend on things and donate money

so if i decide to sell it in the future, i should include the fee, therefore i will not loose money,  so with the fee i paid 1224.68

it's not true, this is exactly like torrents, they shut down 1 torrent server, someone creates another one, they shut down that one, people create another one,  downloading is also illegal, but billions still do it, so you are wrong, 
this would happen to crypocurrencies as well, people will continue to create them and continue to use them, even if they are illegal, the only people who would stop using them, is people as yourself, so are scared to stand up for something they believe in 
thats right, i could of told you that, but it's obvious enough that i don't have to tell you that, i figured you were smart enough to know that, but i was wrong, you're not smart enough because here you are arguing me about it

it was a good article, eventually old people will have to start reading on how bitcoin works and how to use it, if they want a currency that will go up in price, instead of devaluing, and be worth nothing when they retire, 
everytime i go downtown, i always see old people who are part of the banking system, and those old people will probably be the last ones to purchase bitcoin, 
hopefully when i am that old, i won't be like them

i won't keep more than 1 grand on exchanges,  its too risky
if it wasn't risky, i would keep all my bitcoin there and trade, i would of been a millionaire by now,  im getting good at trading, instead i am slowly becoming a millionaire becasue of the price increase, but by then i will be too old to enjoy the money

My goal is to reach 5 bitcoins. Currently i have almost 1 bitcoin. It's getting harder because every time i get paid, bitcoin has raised in price.  At this point i may never reach my goal.  But if i ever do..
My price is 50k
Sell 3 and buy a 150k house
Sell 1 buy a 50k sports car
and my last bitcoin..
Keep 1 for my retirement or until i die... 
I'm keeping 1 bitcoin until the day i die.. not anyone or even my family is getting my last bitcoin
I'm in this for the long run. I'm not selling until it hits my price. I may be waiting a very long time.. but i've been waiting for many years for my bank to give me good rates and they never do.  
But in fact... i am not really waiting until they hit a certain price, i'm actually waiting until i can buy cars houses and stuff with my bitcoin. Eventually we will be able to buy homes and cars directly with bitcoin, in fact i think you can already buy cars on beepi. 
I'm finished with banks and their crappy fake fiat money

i started off with local bitcoins, it was scary at first, but after you get the hang of it, its easy!  heres how it works, 
1. you search for sellers in your city, make sure you search for sellers that want bank deposits only,  
2. you want 1 bitcoin, and he is selling it for 1,300 usd, you start a trade with him,   once you open a trade with him, the localbitcoins websites takes 1 bitcoin from his wallet, and keeps it on the localbitcoins website,  this way he cannot take back the bitcoin because the website has it,  
3.  once the trade is open, his banking information  will show up,  for example his bank information says:
name of bank: ABS bank
name: john smith
account number: 234324
so you find the closest bank called "ABS bank"
you cant go to any bank, it has the be the bank he wants, in this example, its the ABS Bank
4. you go into the bank and tell them you want to deposit 1,300 into this guys bank( dont mention anything about bitcoin)
once you depoist the money, 
5. you drive back home,  and on the localbitcoins website, mark the trade "complete"
6. the seller will receive a notification that you finished the trade, he will look inside his bank account to see if the money is there, 
7.  if the money is there, the seller will tell the localbitcoins website that he received the money, and the website will automatically release the bitcoins to your account, 
8. you send the bitcoins to your wallet,   
thats it!   its very safe, for the seller and buyer,   its hard to get scammed,   i use it all the time,

this is helpful weather to trust a new website or not, 
and of course, always double check the domain name, 
always be smart before you do things especially bitcoin

i was never a gold bug, i looked into buying gold years ago, i think the price was 900?
but it always seemed like a horrible investment, 
not only was it hard to find a reliable website, how was i supposed to know if it was real?
they sent a certificate of authentication,  the premium they charged just to buy gold was too much, then i had to worry about storing it
i wouldn't be able to spend it, pretty much just hold it, and when i wanted to sell it, i had to find a seller and blah blah blah
so much hassles!
gold is horrible, so inconvenient 
i ended up just keeping all my money in a bank
which worked out better in the long run, eventually i found bitcoin and started dumping money into it,
not only did i dump money, i started spending it as well, 
and since the value went up, it was great as i was getting richer
i pretty much paid off all my debts from years ago, 
life is good now, this wouldn't of happened with gold, 
i bought video games last month using bitcoin, could you imagine me trying to purchase video games with gold?   
i wouldn't be able to
thank gold i didn't listen to peter schiff

thats right, bitcoin is not good for lending, because it forces people to save up instead of borrowing, why would you lend money out when your bitcoin is slowing appreciating 
there wont be no need for lending, 
it would be harder for business to expand and develop into big corporations, 
instead it would give power to smaller community shops
therefore once again, i say borrowing is no good, business do not need to borrow

i dumped several thousands into it before,

great work, im going to make my own from your template and change a couple things,
looking forward to seeing the back
if you added your website on the back of the card , i would leave it on, so others can go to your website and download, and make their own, i might hand some out to my friends
this is fun
is there i way i can spend the bitcoins as well?
by having the private key in the back of the card or something?
i wouldn't keep that much on the card in case i lost it, 
i could load more bitcoins when i am home

anyone know a good exchange?
if i buy 1 of each using coinbase, where can i transfer it out so i can sell it for bitcoin when i make some profit

when i first started i hated the fact that you had to download the blockchain, its was annoying and i thought it was frozen and not working, it made me quit bitcoin, but later came back, eventually it finished which was about a week, 
i dont really trust any other wallets online, and definitely don't keep bitcoins on any exchanges for long periods
the desktop wallet is the best, its like my own little bank, having a dedicated hard drive for it makes a big difference, after you download the blockchain you never have to do anything else, it just runs in the background, thats the best way i think
i got 4 hard drives,  for OS files, my files, bitcoin, backups

i've always been a saver... so even if it was 100k tomorrow, what would i need 100k for?
houses are over priced, i will wait until the market crashes, 
for now i would just keep it ,   
i guess my price would be around 100k per coin,  i would sell a small amount, and MAYBE buy a new car,
but i would never sell all my bitcoins,

gold-backed anything is a stupid idea, 
the only reason gold has been king is because there was no internet for thousands of years, 
in fact, fiat money could easily work, the problem is governments/people eventually manipulate it
gold can work as well, the problem is governments/people manipulate it 
almost anything can work as money, as long as people don't get greedy and manipulate it, 
that's what gold bugs don't understand, or simply can't face the fact that gold is on it's way out, 
it doesn't matter weather its physical, what matters is that it cannot be manipulated 
and as we have seen in the past, gold keeps being manipulated, so going back to a gold standard will accomplish nothing
in fact it would be going backwards, 
with the invention of the internet, a digital currency makes much more sense
but not just any digital currency, as the monetary system is pretty much already a digital currency 
this gold-backed crypto makes no sense, where exactly are you supposed to keep the gold, are you supposed to trust a 3rd party with the gold? 
what makes gold so special, because there is only so much gold in the world?
bitcoin has already solved all these problems, and mining bitcoins is much safer for humans then the gold mines around the world, 
gold will be good in the future for electronics, but that's pretty much it, 
the world is moving forward, it's funny to see all these gold bugs trying hard not to face the truth
they don't want to face the truth, 
it's a scary thought to think gold will be pretty much worthless in the future, 
what bitcoin is doing, is exactly what gold should be doing if it wasn't so easily manipulated 
sad and scary truth

its expensive! the good old days are long gone, and to send bitcoins you have to do math , the fee minus how much bitcoin you have left,   it hurts my head,

it will continue to be this way, the majority of holders don't want to pay taxes on gains, 
untill the government decides not to tax bitcoin gains, holders will be reluctant to start a company, cash out,  or do something useful with their bitcoins
bitcoin will continue to keep climbing and climbing, eventually in order to get people to spend their bitcoins and spend it on the economy, governments will have to do something, 
this won't be soon, as bitcoin is fairly new, 
we will eventually see other countries trying to attract bit-millionaires and bit-billionaires to their countries, by offering tax free,  
as fiat becomes more and more worthless, people will continue to move over to crypto, 
can you imagine if governments said it wasn't taxed and you'd be free to spend it? their would be thousands of people spending it, it would make bitcoin worth more
until then the big whales can do nothing but trade or hold
i have been holding for years although i am not a millionaire, i do have a good chuck of money, which i would like to spend, but the governments are holding me back from spending it, why should i give my gains to politicans, when i did all the work, and they do nothing and profit from my gains, 
if in the future, there is a country that offers tax free, i will gladly move from here, 
there about 200 countries in the world, i go where i am more free

bitcoin is great for porn customers because you no longer have to hand over your credit card information, and worry about them charging you again and again, and also trying to cancel the forced membership without success
bitcoin is great for porn website administrators, because visa is picky about what type of porn you sell, bitcoin doesn't care what type of porn you sell
bitcoin is bad because porn administrators can no longer trick/force you into subscribing for a monthly membership
overall it's a win for both
bitcoin is King!

i donated once to a charity 15 years ago, had to give my address, and they've been sending me stickers and letters every year for the past 15 years, even though i only donated once
i remember wikipedia wanted a donation so i emailed them about giving my address and they said i had to give me address, so i told them to screw themseleves
i refuse to give my address,
so i have never donated after that first time,
plus when i think about it, charities seem like a scam, 
i much rather donate online to developers, bloggers or websites i like,

he's a salesman, what kind of salesman would say bad things about the product he's selling
when i was a salesman, i lied the shit out of everything, and i sold tons of subscriptions 
that's what a good salesman does, SHOW ME DA MONEY

throw it all in and hold, that's what i did years ago, and it paid off big time, no bank savings account or stocks gonna give you back as much as bitcoin, plus you are supporting one of the greatest inventions of the 21 centruy, so i say again..
throw it all in and hold!

not safe because a robber or a policeman could simply cut off your finger and steal your bitcoins

their editor made a mistake, should say Bitcoin, and not Bitcoins
