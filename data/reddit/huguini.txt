Imagine this:
CSW really is Satoshi (maybe not alone but, at least, the guy behind the main idea.
He didn't want to out himself but, because of the leak, he feels he as to. (Maybe also some vanity that I picked up from some of his interviews)
He holds a very big stash of bitcoin (the specific amount isn't relevant just that he wants it to still have value)
To be sure that bitcoin doesn't crash (he's probably the person with most to lose financially with a crash), he first makes sure that people know he can't dump all his Bitcoins by putting them on a Trust. "See? I couldn't even dump them if I wanted to."
Then he decides to come forward.
Knowing that most people won't believe him (we know this from the reaction to last year leaks, the burden of proof is different to each person you ask) so he decides to prove his identity to a couple of well respected (or at least known) members of the community. 
Then he gives the BBC interview but keeps some ambiguity as a way to dampen the impact of the news. Those who he already revealed himself to, provide confirmation to start cementing the idea.
His plan is to reveal the final proof by moving coins from block 1 or 9, the ones people consider as surely from satoshi's stash. 
But, the trust doesn't allow to move any coins (or this is also just a part of the plan to dampen the effect of the reveal) and he decides not to move any coin after all.
Then JVP announces the trust will speak in September : the final reveal.
Crazy, right?

If sorting through 1800 pics to find a specific face isn't a task for reddit, I don't know what is.

Problem is most people around here equate no proof = lie. From a logical standpoint, that's not how it works.

What about downloading all WTH photos, upload them to a Google Photos account, add some Craig Wright photos and tag them with is name and let their facial recognition features do the work? We would "only" have to sort through some false positives.
