Changing SHA256 is fine if that algorithm will be compromised at some point of time. Changing PoW algorithm when big enough party attacks at Bitcoin is not fine -&gt; PoW model is broken in that case.

Yeah, thanks for clarifying that. My thoughts about PoW validity was simplistic and left various elements out that make up what is Bitcoin.
"Red button" that allows Bitcoin users to destroy expensive mining hardware of attackers is really good tool for balancing power between actors. I really feel that this whole episode is just another chapter in this great experiment and it only reinforces Bitcoin.

PoW change is too radical change and surely it will ruin Bitcoin by creating collateral damage for other ASIC manufacturers, but I understand usage of that option if there's single too powerful enemy that attacks at Bitcoin.
Bitcoin consensus protocol PoW is broken if we need to change algorithm. Changing is only kicking the can down to road kind of solution. What we'll do next time when some big party develops ASICs for new algorithm and attacks against us?

True, if SHA256 is broken it needs to be replaced for Bitcoin to survive. However, if Bitcoin PoW allows large player to attack and take over network PoW itself is broken.

It would be great if we could boot specific device manufacturers / mining pools (read Antminer/Antpool) from network. It's shame that we need to replace SHA256 and all existing devices from network. It's a route that surely destroys Bitcoin and should be used as a last resort. e.g Government or some really powerful entity attacking bitcoin.

What he tries to achieve? Some kind of control over Bitcoin?

Bcash is just shitcoin without any kind of acceptance.
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:57:19
Thanks, now we can dump those bitcoin cash shitcoins.
@_date: 2017-07-25 05:43:47
Great, thanks!
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:55:11
But BCC is shitcoin

we need tutorial and support how to split possible Bitcoin Cash coins from our real Bitcoins by using Trezor.

With Ver and Voorhees on board with McAfee I guess this will be Classic pool...

Listen, it does not take long time until major chip manufacturer steps in mining game. I'm talking about Intel, AMD, Qualcomm level companies. They're going to destroy Jihan's tiny company.
