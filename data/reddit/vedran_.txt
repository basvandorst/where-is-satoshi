I'm running a full node (not the archive node). Dedicated machine with 500GB of SSD and 16Gb of RAM. It took around a week to sync initially. If it's offline for a day, it takes around 20 minutes to sync.
So yeah, blockchain is big. These points are being addressed. We should have PoS and sharding in 2018. Sidechains a little further down the road. It's a work in progress.

Declaratively 200/100 Mbit/s, although it's not always that fast.
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:40:23
It's standard markdown syntax, but you can also [generate]( and c/p it.
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:38:06
Without the full nodes, whole p2p network would not be possible. You could say the perk is to have the blockchain.

No idea. Sorry. I'm running Parity.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:39:20
In case this isn't clear:
|     | tx/day    | fee       |
| BTC | 400,000   | very high |
| ETH | 1,000,000 | very low  |
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:48:17
Agreed. You can't really compare BTC to ETH on application level. If you give Turing complete virtual machine to smart contract developers, it is likely that more then feet will be shot.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:47:11
Meanwhile Ethereum is doing 1,000,000 tx/day, where average fee is less then 1$.

As I understand it, [there is no core wallet for Ethereum]( There are multiple clients implementing the same protocol.
At the time, I choose Parity because I read somewhere that Vitalik runs it. He should know.
As for the hacks, they did have two [vulnerabilities with multisig wallets]( but this is not the only thing Parity is known for. First Parity developer was Gavin Wood, one of eight Ethereum founders. I think Parity if one of two most popular Ethereum clients.

DAO is a bug in the contract, not the protocol. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 14:17:58
Exactly what I was looking for. Thanks.
Still he doesn't address the problem of real-time transactions between banks, which have different central banks. For example, transaction from an account in German bank to one in Japanese bank.
@_date: 2014-04-22 15:25:48


OK. Do you have any links, which explain this in greater detail than the mentioned article? I was expecting a service like CLS Group.


This is called a workaround.

 * Electronic money.  
 * Transactions take a few minutes. 
 * Transaction fees are incredibly cheap. 
 * No bank or bank account is required.

They provide following reason:

Not sure if the run-down building and the semi naked women help the credibility, but I like the style. It's bitcoin, it's russian - fuck it!
@_date: 2014-04-22 15:40:53
Let's assume it's the same currency, for the sake of easier understanding.
states that those transactions [fall under "Correspondent Banking"](

I appreciate the initiative and effort. Here is my constructive criticism.
It is not important who created bitcoin. It's an interesting anecdote to provoke interest, but that's it.
"Under the hood" section explains very little, granted it is very difficult to sum it up in 3-4 slides. It is important to understand, to implement electronic money, it is fundamental to solve transaction verification. Miners verify transactions by doing computationally difficult work. If it wasn't difficult, counterfeiting would be easy. Miners are incentivised to do the work by rewarding them new BTC. This also solves the problem of introducing new money to the system and distributing it.
To understand bitcoin, one must understand two concepts: money and P2P networks. Few people understand these concepts.
Money is easy to explain. Anything which has following three properties can serve as money:
 * Medium of exchange
 * Store of value
 * Measure of value
P2P networks can be explained by contrasting them to client - server networks.
@_date: 2014-04-22 15:02:03
Could be. 
Than it would have all the disadvantages inherent to that approach, as described in the article. As stated, this would be problematic with large transactions.

Well, we ran the simulations, using models which simplified real life complexity. Models used finite number of variables. The variables were entered in a model with finite precision.
Surely we know the consequences!

He's a humble handsome Asian man who is confused why that bitch is on his brothers ass. He suspects the whole thing is orchestrated by someone without a moral compass.
I like his version better, though.

I genuinely curious, what makes you certain the Jeffrey's  profile is legitimate?
@_date: 2019-03-13 18:55:00
Good point!
@_date: 2019-03-13 19:45:49
It's like a monetery version of anti-vaxers. Bunch of layman, coming up with their own conclusions, with total disregard for hundreds of years of theory and practise, available at the tip of the finger.
@_date: 2019-03-13 18:59:55
I think more inteligent view it like so:

They are both inflating in supply? Was that the point?
@_date: 2016-12-21 08:36:01
I was wrong. Sorry.
@_date: 2016-12-20 18:42:24
How did you come to the conclusion I watch and read sources like CNN?
@_date: 2016-12-20 13:51:07
Thanks for what? That he appointed climate change denier as the chief of staff? That climate change denial is Trumps official policy? That he's a threat to Iranian nuclear deal?
@_date: 2016-12-20 21:21:11
Anecdotal. He got less votes than Romney or McCain.
@_date: 2016-12-20 16:07:30
Great argument!
@_date: 2016-12-21 15:34:03
Read it in Croatian newspapers. Funny enough, it was a serious article, with false data obviously. I'm sure I remember it correctly.
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:26:01


I think he did. The first sentence is the replay to that situation.

Whether it was caused by bad actors or not, network must be resilient to it. Bitcoin can potentially attract much more powerful enemies.

Reading the comments, I was wandering the whole time, is it possible to create decentralized exchange. Thanks for the info.
Here's the [wiki](
