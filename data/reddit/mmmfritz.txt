You can use 0.001 of bitcoin to trade whatever. If that is the value of a house in Zambia then so be it, just trade your rocks for BTC and buy your house.
Just because BTC is limited, does that mean the value will go up. That is a misconception of it not being a commodity. Probably the same misconception that is happening in Venezuela right now.

For number 3 I would also add:
Just because there is only going to be 21 million Bitcoins, doesn't mean it's a finite resource.
Bitcoin can be broken up into any number of denominations, even 1000 if needed.
The typical increase in 'demand' for 'finite' resources is only attributed to those asset classes that are actually finite, like gold or silver.
This way bitcoin should trade more like a fiat currency, or a store of value (investment).
Unless of course the price remains permanently inflated (unlikely) and then people will hold for capital gain making it useless as means of trade (fiat).

Yeah. A survey of 'retards'

Think about all the Muppets who are in the red, then compare  to the ppl who bought early. Price is not inflated not by a long shot.

Maybe. I would diversify to be sure.

The only consistent thing is inconsistency. There are people who can beat the market but I doubt any  in this sub is one of them.

As long as you know that what you are doing isn't investing, that's okay.
Just remember that crypto isn't some magical money tree. You still have to pick the right coins.
If you are going to diversify crypto then you may as well diversify into hares or bonds.
Otherwise you may as well put everything on a horse.

Not sure why you're being down voted here... your comments are exaggerated but truthful none the less.

What share of your portfolio is BTC? I was thinking 10% might be a good start, including a stop loss, but I am unsure where to go.
@_date: 2016-02-13 08:11:01
Shit 50%. I wont go above 10% for the moment. I don't know anything about cryptos though.

I am saying that no other bubble in the history of humans has gone 10 or 100x, twice.
You are obviously invested in bitcoin and emotion is taking part. I am invested in ethereum and I think it will do another 10x. Logically the chances are slim.

Google bubble history vs bitcoin.
Theres heaps of graphs, you must be 12 to not know this. 100 shitcoins says you bought in above $1k. That's why you're emotionally invested.
I bought ether at $2 
Eat me
@_date: 2019-09-24 06:32:13
Yeah. Bitcoin has already been the biggest bubble in human history. Chances there is another bitcoin bubble with another 100x or even 10x is slim.

Bitcoin is most definitely not a tulip.
But it sure as shit is in a bubble.
And what ever you class it as, it aint even close to blue chip.

This reminds me of the Pirates v global warming graph
@_date: 2019-09-24 06:53:39
You're talking volume not return.
There is loads of historical data on bubbles. 
If bitcoin does another 10x then that will be unprecedented and the first of its kind.
