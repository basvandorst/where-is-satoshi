I'm not convinced either way, but I don't see why you assume there needs to be manual intervention.  I could imagine a fully-automatic implementation that used the tx-id to ensure that the transaction was accepted by the network.  When such a system found no transaction at all, it could undo the related balance change and allow the user to withdraw it again.  
Far-fetched?  Well if they built for the edge-case of a transaction getting dropped, they should have likely taken the time to log the incident and therefore should have noticed.  And they also should have tested for this case if they really had "hardening and pentesting procedures."

The difference between the others is not the calculation we're concerned about.  We're only concerned with the portion in Ghash.  Ghash/Total.  Moving 5 is (Ghash-5)/Total.

Ok so you think bitcoinica lends the btc, then buys it back immediately?  At what price?  Walk me through the process that's in your head please.
btw, you're right that bitcoinica doesn't want the investor to make money shorting.  But that's because the borrowed btc is then worth less, not because they have to pay the investor.

@_date: 2012-11-10 03:25:05
The game doesn't let you earn bitcoin at all.  You must be thinking of something else.  Minethings is a free-to-play MMO where you can buy virtual goods with bitcoins/paypal.  That's its only connection to the real world. 
@_date: 2012-11-09 18:16:40

@_date: 2012-10-08 08:11:19
So non-greedy means they charge 1% until they have no more bitcoins to sell, then are forced to raise the price to 100% when they are out?
@_date: 2012-01-19 06:14:15
Ok I thought bitcoinica always hedged their orders on MtGox.  If that's incorrect, then it seems to me that the transaction should not be called "shorting" but rather "betting on the price."  A short in my dictionary requires some open-market trade to occur.  Is my definition incorrect?
@_date: 2012-01-26 06:43:20
Some wealthy people knew about the episode well before it aired and bought in (bringing it from $3-$7).  Now they're selling to the audience at 100% profit.

I own a [website]( that accepts bitcoins and I've been watching my sales as the value of bitcoins skyrockets.  They tell an interesting tale.
First off, I should mention that I have a script that pulls price data nightly from an btc/usd exchange and adjusts my prices accordingly.  The price drops lately have been dramatic of course.  
So what did the sales do?  Well, if it was drizzling btc before, it's pouring now.  I've gone from a sale every few days to several sales *per* day now.  This is despite the fact that customers could potentially be future millionaires if they kept those coins.  
I know that this stage of the bitcoin economy isn't directly comparable to the end-game, but I figured I'd share an example of how dropping prices can encourage sales.
@_date: 2011-06-15 15:29:22


Some merchants cannot afford to do this because they are buying USD with the bitcoins in order to buy inventory.  But there are likely a good number of merchants that can afford a discount.  My site [Minethings]( consistently holds the btc prices at about 10% below the USD prices.  
@_date: 2011-05-17 14:59:15

The problem is, there's not way to prove that the bitcoins were, in fact, stolen.  You'd have people blackmailing each other: "give me half your bitcoins or I'll claim you stole them."

I've had a bitcoin payment option since April or so (at a 10% discount even).  That exposure actually inspired bitcoin-dedicated websites, so I know some were receptive to the idea.  Now that it's not a choice though, some people are not so happy.  
@_date: 2011-08-08 16:52:47
There's no reason why they should match 1:1.  btc and usd are used by completely different subsets of the world population.  
Also, there are roughly 1 billion dollars (M2) for every bitcoin.  Not that this should determine the price either.  It's more complicated than that.
@_date: 2011-04-21 05:06:35
I made a browser-based MMO that accepts bitcoins.  That might take you a while though.
I'm in the process of moving the game to a server company that accepts bitcoins and that's something you can do with a bit of training: resell hosting services.
More generally, resell anything.  Buy in USD and sell at a profit for BTC.  It'll give prospective bitcoin users all the more reason to want to join.

Both of you don't realize that there's no such thing as fundamental value as distinguished from some other type of value.  Even gold's "fundamental value" is simply one of the ways that we observe people using it.  
Also, you'd be hard-pressed to find any use in gold when everybody in the world had disappeared, so that's not a very useful construct for determining whether something has a use other than as money.

No.  Why would they?  
The causes of the dollar's decline are money printing and selling the dollar.  Printing USD doesn't affect the value of btc.  In selling dollars, some of those dollars will be exchanged for btc.  So if there's an effect, it will be to increase the demand for and value of btc.

Protected?  Credit card fraud is a huge problem and consumers ultimately end up paying for it. A bitcoin user can not only password-protect his phone/wallet, he can transfer funds out of the wallet with a backup if it's stolen.  
@_date: 2013-03-28 07:25:30
To extend on this further (I've set up a couple merchants this way): They need a web browser at the counter.  The merchant visits the url that Bitpay provides with each account (found [here](  The merchant enters the fiat amount, hits enter and shows the resulting invoice with QR code to the customer.  Customer scans it, confirms the price, sends the coins.  The invoice auto-updates when the coins are received.  
@_date: 2013-06-07 08:37:28
Yeah, an "investment" is generally something you expect to go up in value.  If we're supposed to buy 1% more bitcoins each month to retain value then this is a terrible investment.  
@_date: 2013-05-07 08:15:10
They use bitpay's Checkout Now feature which handles the exchange rate.  The server just types in the dollar amount and the customer does the rest.  It's not fully integrated with their POS to the point where the POS is aware of the transaction, but there is now a button on their POS that says "Bitcoin" and it's treated much like cash from there.  Bitpay has a ledger that the owner/accountant can check at any time to update the books.  
And no, they don't wait for any confirmations.  The expectation is that nobody's going to try a double-spend for such a small amount of money.

They will need a smartphone with a wallet.  I use Bitcoin Spinner which interfaces with a QR scanner.  All I have to do is open my phone wallet, scan the QR code and hit "send."  
It's okay if you don't have this sort of thing yourself.  All you need is a web browser.  The QR code is generated at the website and displayed on the page for the customer to scan.

No surprise.  Their last newsletter subject was, "Dwolla teams up with the government."  Not even joking.

What game is it?  
I accept bitcoins via Bitpay at my browser MMO [minethings.com]( and have no complaints.  Their API is really easy to use and they have a PHP sample script to get you started.  I too figured it wasn't worth saving 1% to make my own version.

Why is excluding slow miners a good thing?

Couldn't they have multiple accounts at one bank?

You do give permission.  You are sending all that info whenever you visit any site on the internet.  To tell sites this info and then not expect them to use it is backwards.  It's better to just not tell them the info in the first place.

Headline is misleading.  They were approached by 5 African companies expressing *interest* in the ATM.
