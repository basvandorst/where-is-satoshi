oh ok, might not understand you correctly. Do I believe in 5 billion coins lost a year. Probably not. In the real life scenario dogecoin is not really deflationary, but in theory it still is if you look at it in the long long time period :]

True. I didn't mean to be dishonest in my claims.

I kinda stumbled here from :] here are a couple of the news outlets that wrote about this:
NASCAR fans on Reddit use DogeCoin to sponsor Josh Wise - NBC Sports
What is DogeCoin, and what does it have to do with NASCAR? - AutoWeek
A Dogecoin-sponsored NASCAR is happening after group raises more than $44,700 - The Verge
Doge And Dogecoin Are Actually, Really Headed To NASCAR - Jalopnik
Redditors use Dogecoins to help sponsorless NASCAR driver - Fansided
Talladega Shibe: Dogecoin Is Headed to NASCAR - Motherboard
There's Going To Be A Dogecoin Car At Talladega - Business Insider
Dogecoin Nascar Sponsorship Funded By Reddit - The Escapist
There Will Be a Doge Car at Talladega. Wow. Amaze. - The News Wheel
A Dogecoin-sponsored NASCAR is a thing that’s happening - Death and Taxes
Dogecoin raises enough money to sponsor Josh Wise at Talladega - Yahoo Sports
Wow. Such fast. Dogecoin to sponsor Nascar racer - CNet
There were a lot more but I don't feel like looking them up right now. As you can see it's not only FTimes/Forbes/BI this time around, we got a lot of coverage in car/moto/sport outlets, which brings new demographics and interests for cryptocurrencies.

it's like fiat currency... but instead of a unknown inflation rate the rate is set at 5B doges a year after initial 100B doge mined. So the inflation gets lower every year. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 10:58:27
that's why even though some people say dogecoin is inflationary, it's is really deflationary (like bitcoin).

you are thinking about litecoin subreddit.
