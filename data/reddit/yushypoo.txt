U may lose your job but.
Download Minergate. 
Register. 
Install in all the computers.
Start mining monero in each of them with less than half the cpu cores.
Disable starting at computer startup throught settings. Delete all the shortcuts from desktop and startmenu shortcuts.
Make sure to turn off all the computers before anyone gets back to work.
Exchange monero for btc
1 monero = $88.
Good luck

Thats a different thing. You are comparing USD to BTC. This post is comparing apple company with bitcoin community. Apple can pay off certain people to divert govt eyes. One person cant pay someone to divert eyes from whole bitcoin community.

U can invest in them like regular stocks but cant accept it as a payment. If u r needed to make receipts of sale then dnt, if not just ask the customer if he agrees to keep btc transaction to himself. Beware of snitches doe. :)

Dude zebpay is allowing users to sell bitcoins at a premium of $1000 too lol 
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:01:52
Maybe OP should read the headline again cause it say "Can go" not " Can't go" 
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:02:33
Itd be great if all the hours read HODL. So ud say "well will u look at the fkin time" everytime someone asks to sell bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:56:31
The fees increases as the value of bitcoin increases. Like when the price of bitcoin was $5000 max miner fee was around $2.5, after bitcoin crossed $6000 max fees jumped to $3.
For the question when reward value is less than their electricity cost, which is the current situation of every miner that doesnt have ASIC miners or high end gpu, they will simply stop mining btc. But that will only happen if bitcoin were to lose like 50% of its value in a day.

And the range of random numbers is from 1 to  1461501600000000000000000000000000000000000000000.

Bruh btc is comparable to every currency, btc didnt originate from one currency. Anyone with any currency can buy and sell btc.

There doesn't seem to be a problem with mycelium. I just restored my account on my old phone with the 12 word seed and it worked. Maybe u copied the seed wrong. Make sure u type the seed from 1-12 and not 12-1
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:37:47
Same can be done with app wallets. Write the seed on paper, secure it and delete the app.

Fire burning, water flowing and Bitcoin soaring wouldve been better
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:23:09
Itd be better if u sell them and buy btc with fiat

Or you could just keep working and keep buying btc and keep HODLING till u retire with a fuckin castle to live in.

@_date: 2017-11-01 09:54:00
They receive the miner fee from the person that sends bitcoin to someone else. Let's say all 21mil btc are in circulation, the miners will earn their fee by charging from the bitcoin sender like they do right now! 
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:00:27
Bread wallet makes a new address everytime for your own protection. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:11:28
If banks were to buy huge amounts of bitcoin they wouldnt be against bitcoin since no one is gonna buy something and hope its value goes down. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:21:37
Dollar cost averaging, divide your money u want to spend on btc, buy some now, buy some later. No one can predict whether price will go up or down, so if price goes down buy btc with the remaining amount. If it goes up then yolo buy some more.

Kraken low key hinting u to HODL
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:05:39
The bitcoin sender chooses the fees he wants to pay in consideration of time. Like if someone wants to send the bitcoin with top priority they choose to spend $3 fee. Fee lowers as u increase time. This $3 is distributed among a set number of miners that confirm the transaction. For example if 10 miners confirm the transaction each get $0.3
You can check miner fees at

So lets say someone in 2016 set a sell order for 1300 and never canceled it, and i put a buy order of the same amount of btc for 1300 today will it work?

Btckey.space is much better, displays tje balance in the addresses.
I found a couple of satoshis in some addresses, was fun but very time consuming.
If u find a balance DON'T STEAL

Lol not for someone who bought at 19k
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:21:30
So what happens if i send more bitcoins on the 1st address? Do they accumulate? 
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:32:57
That is the standard miner fees though! 226sat/byte ~ $2 for every transaction even if its a transfer of 1 whole bit coin.  
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:31:26
Btc reached its new high after the split. So I shud buy rn?

Do not keep or bit coin on a desktop wallet if u intend to HODL for long. If u substantial amount of btc ( .5+ btc) go for hardware wallets . If they are not substantial ( say .1 btc ) go for paper wallets.

Im not calling myself moron because the price dropped and that i fear losing my money. Just that had i waited a couple of hours i cudve bought it cheaper. I have faith in bitcoin. :D
@_date: 2017-10-25 04:36:48
Trezor costs $80-$90 thats almost half ur btc holding, paper wallets are easy n free*.
* Transferring your btc from coinbase to paper wallet will have a miner fee of approx $1-$2, free / cheap whatever u wanna call it lol. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:44:26
Thanks i made a mycelium wallet and transferred my btc to it. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:45:08
Will do. Thank you
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:53:03
I see so lets say mycelium generated 4 addresses due to 4 receive transactions of .25BTC each so now my wallet has 1btc, now i wanna send .5btc what is the transfer criteria? 
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:15:39
Yo i got a question but this sub wont let me post it. I have few btc on my Mycelium wallet since before the recent fork which means i got BTG too, where are they and how do i exchange them for btc?  
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:54:47
Im not worried about selling them, im worried about buying at a lower price. In this situation had i waited couple of hours i couldve bought it cheaper. I have faith in bitcoin and believe that it will cross $10000 next year.
