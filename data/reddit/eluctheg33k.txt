I think you are a bit hardcore here, like any job the least qualified will have to reconvert to a totally new sector or die, but the skilled one are killing machines trained to steal shit load of money from rich people and most rich people are not the smartest one earth unfortunately so they will still get milked for a long time. And the most skilled one will adapt to any new economic system and still take out as much as possible out of it.
Anyway none will have the chance to flip burger has we (engineers) will make a machine doing that for cheaper than any human, and in addition it will grow lab meat directly to avoid killing environment by farming cows.

You are always more clever after. Of course anyone would have bought at 3200 if they know for sure it was not going lower soon. But it might have gone to 500$, who knows. 
The only point to get here is that buying in a parabolic rise is risky as hell for sure.

If your bank doesn't care about crypto they might regret it later. It's maybe not a huge threat right now but still something to follow and try to anticipate or it might cost your bank a lot in the future. I'm sure some persons above you have that in mind even if it doesn't come down to you.
I have friends in some of the biggest banks in the world and they are talking about it and try to find strategies to take advantage of it depending of how this will evolve.
I'm quite confident that the banks or most banks will disappear eventually or at least no more exist in the form we are used to today. But who knows, we will see.

Qoqa.ch is famous for their special deals during their anniversary week, last year they offer (a very limited quantities) of Tesla Model S with 50% discount.
It's just pure advertising for their shop and Bity partner, one of the Swiss Bitcoin exchange service but still worth mentioning how close to general public Bitcoin has become.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:14:30
No, this company is very famous in the French part of Switzerland, they have always honored deal like that. You have to know that they pay for the "free" BTC, probably shared with Bity too, and the available quantity was unknown but probably very small, like when they bought Tesla S and sold them half price, there was like 5 or 10 or them top. It makes people come everyday at midnight on their website to try to get one of these deal but most of the time it's deal on product slightly below the best internet price, so they use the "limited quantity, limited duration" to make customers do impulse purchase and it works well.
@_date: 2015-06-10 21:04:58
Indeed it's good news, we should be able to read headlines in major general media like: "Bitcoin is now stable enough to be day to day usable with less and less risk" but instead people stop caring about it and are waiting for an hypothetical massive bubble that are going to make everyone rich in days.

@_date: 2015-06-12 05:40:58
While people always think about selling illegal stuffs, I'm thinking about selling retro video games and Amiibo figures. I've tried to put some on sale on my OB shop but it was too buggy for buyers to be able to trust in the platform, before trusting third party escrow we must be able to 100% trust the platform, I don't want a bug or misusage to put my bitcoin in limbo.

In this case what happen if people take advantage of this kind of bug and get some digitalgoods during that time ? I were that close to try to get a voucher just to try but then I thought that if I would be the seller I would be screwed so It's not fair to take advantage of this bug. But I'm sure some people are not as honest as me.
I'm sure that other website were in that case too, maybe with enven bigger consequences. It could be a good idea to think about a safty guard like if the price move more than x% in xx minutes don't change the price or block all operations until human validation.

Even if it (will) happen it's just temporary until people works 100% on bitcoin (fixed salary in bitcoin for spending on something with a foxed price in bitcoin). Then it would be like watching now some bad currency from a corrupted country moving up and down against Swiss Franc or Euro, it doesn't affect your purchase capability (don't know the exact term in English).

@_date: 2014-03-10 07:24:34
I really like what you wrote. However I don't agree on every points or at least I would add more parameters. Most general public will have fear to adopt because of security. What if my bitcoin worth half the price tomorrow morning? Even if the value went back a few days later it's still a problem if I have to pay some bills with it and don't have fiat to buy back the bitcoin before the price goes up again. What if I loose everything because my computer get hacked? Most people had difficulties to keep a clean computer without AdWare toolbars and other virus and malware.
Also you talk about the jealousy of people arriving late and that is right, if you're looking at bitcoin in order to make "easy money" it's too late or it looks like it now. In order to stay fair between early birds and new coming another cryptocurrency could be better, even if at therm it will no more matter.
Bitcoin is an amazing invention and it has change cards forever now we will have to wait and see what people, groups, companies and governments will do with that new technology. As you said all we can do is using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as much as possible, get involved on internet, talk with friends about it and enjoy freedom.

Yeah right, I found one that's doing what I want, working in France, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg, but they give you back only 33 to 50% of what you spend with your phone to call a pay per call number (the call cost 2.50€ and they give you 1.10€ in Bitcoin, Litcoin or gift card). I think that I prefer to offer the credit to the phone company than to thief like these website.

At some point this afternoon it was 1€ = 0.90CHF, now it's already 1.05CHF. It will probably stabilize soon between the lowest and last value during the blocking at 1.20. I guess they were buying cash for everyday use not all saving, only for short/mid therm.

Most change on shops and restaurants are proposed with a major fee, I've seen at many place the change displayed for 1€ = 1 CHF for months.

On the other way it's much much slower, as slow as possible is the best for business.

I didn't say there is only one ATM, I said that I know only one that is both way. I did know they was a few of them, I have seen only one in Geneva in fact, but I wouldn't say it's a lot. Now with many buying point in every train stations it's a lot of "ATM" for sure but it has to work first, I did try again this morning and the first machine has a defective scanner, it didn't light at all and the other one was working but it couldn't read a code on a smartphone screen, only on paper, so it's more or less useless, especially if you use a wallet with new address for each reception of BTC like most of them do.
@_date: 2016-11-30 07:56:26
Did you try to print the code? I'll try it once.
@_date: 2016-11-30 07:53:45
Yes it would be a great plus, transfer by free Swiss bank transfer and then exchange directly CHF to BTC. One exchange in Switzerland was looking to do it but they never did fiat at the end (I don't remember the name) and it's the same for ~~Shiftshaft~~ ShapeShift (Edit: I will never get it right) only cryptocurrencies exchange.
@_date: 2016-11-29 20:39:39
1. Not so much
1. Not really advertised by the train company in any way, just you fan buy if you want/need to.
1. Not really but now you can pay for an audit in Ernst and Young and in their main building in Zurich office there is a two way Bitcoin ATM. I don't know any other ATM getting to sell Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-02 08:09:37
I did success to buy some, you have to hold the code far from the scanner like 20-30cm. But the exchange and fee is a huge scalp, I have calculate 8.7% of fees for 20CHF, you have 1.21CHF of fee and then the rate is a bit below too, so at the end I got 0.02359742BTC for 20CHF paid.
Experience was fun but I'll probably never buy more BTC from these machines unless they cool down on fees.

We should wait for a new ATH to write a new line, otherwise you are never sure.

"Bitcoin will crash eventually. Like this time when it reach 18k$ and it crashed all the way down to 7k$."

I think you shouldn't take too seriously what people write on Reddit and many other place on the internet (same for newspaper and TV most of the time). Starting from middle of 2017 I have started to get and more sceptical about in mean, reason, pattern or something with crypt I currencies prices. And I doubt more and more every day that we will see any 100k$ BTC  nor any 10k$ ETH any time soon or ever. How ever I still think (and hope) we will have chance to see a new ATH eventually but I'm not sure sure about it.

Too bad it is not accepted in China, they all want you to pay with that creepy AliPay app.

How much worth his house? In my country it's almost impossible to find a decent house for a family of 4 with less than 1.2 or 1.3 millions (eq. $).

It was maybe at the airport or train station. The other day at the airport I was looking to buy a cookie, then I saw it was 9$ for one cookie...

To be honest, most of the cost is the land here, maybe 2/3 of it, at least 1/2. Switzerland is expensive.
@_date: 2017-05-24 09:32:24
Yeah sure, I'm not talking about a chalet in the middle of the Alpes with no bus stop at less than 5km. I'm talking about houses in 50km around most industries and jobs areas. But even if you go more in the countryside it's not so much cheaper.
Prices are going up everywhere and what you can save in a year with a good job a little above the average salary (that is way above average of every other countries around us) is not enough to cover even the price difference with the previous year. So it seams unreachable for most people here. You are doom to rent a 3 bedroom apartments at 2500$ per month for the rest of your life unless you inherit enough to make a mortgage at some point.

Was coming to say that, the Ethereum foundation is in Zug, in addition to Shapshift and the others I would guess that some people working in a Bitcoin related company could also be in the politics of the city. With time these old politicians are getting out of the game, it's time for the younger game changers.

BTC that are on a Nano S before the fork are safe to be split later but what about BTC that are transferred after the fork ? In Ethereum fork I got a very hard time splitting my coin with the official wallet, so I transfered ETH to Jaxx Wallet and I was pleasantly surprised that it has detected a possible slip, then I was able to get ETH + ETC even if these coins where not in Jaxx wallet before the fork.
Will it be similar here? Could I just transfer BTC from Jaxx, Coinomi, Electrum, mycelium or any serious wallet to the Nano S after the fork and then split? Or is it absolutely mandatory that I send them before?
I hope that all serious wallet will come soon with a split strategy that can be easily used next week and after but so far only Ledger talked about this.

It's only on a short time window. Swiss Franc was also more volatile than Bitcoin for a day when the Swiss Central Bank drop of the minimal 1€ = 1.20CHF ratio that was artificially limited for 2-3 years.

Good point

Waow! I would never imagine that they were so many competition in this field. The only on that is working in my country currency is not providing new car right now... 
And I'm still waiting for Revolut to accept Bitcoin as top up, now I can only top up in EUR but my back charge 2.8% in fee hidden in the change rate. Not sure if I can concert my currency to BTC for less than 2.8%.

Nor sure what they mean by manipulation, Germany use Euro and they are not the only one with control on it and Switzerland has one of the most valuable currency in the world, the National Swiss Bank even had to buy Euro to not get too much deflation of the currency because of buy pressure. So OK it might be seen as manipulation but it's not to drown all other currencies so they should stop complaining.

Nice but sender must have a secure way to send the private key 1, preferably not email or not the same email as the one transmitted to the service to send the private key 2, otherwise anyone with access to the email of the receiver will have access to the complete private key and we know how unsecure most email are.
So it's a gift that need some coordination and then ruin a bit of the surprise.
Better print a paper wallet and send it to them by snailmail.

I think that Armory is the most ambitious Bitcoin wallet ever made, it's by far the wallet to trust if you are wokring with significant amount of bitcoin. However the new (stable) version is cruelly missing, a lot of people are waiting on it so I hope that the funding will help to solve the software problems in both short term and long term.

Massive digging up of topic here but to answer you have no chance to get back your old key. Went you set up a Google Authenticator on a website make sure there is a way to recover it. On gmail you can use backup one time password (you print a list of 10 codes that you can use without google auth but are valid only once). On Lastpass you can restore with your email address (if it's a gmail with Google Auth you need the one time password, it could become tricky). But on most other website there is no possiblity to bypass google auth, so when adding a Google Auth login please always backup the private key (on a piece of paper for example, or on a TrueCrypt volume, on KeePass, Lastpass enventually). You can also backup the whole Google Auth app using Titanium backup as suggested by others, just be sure that your backup are encrypted and uploaded to a cloud service (DropBox ie.)
Now I'm afraid you will have to do a ticket to BTC-e and I'm not sure they can solve it for you depending on how the 2-factor system is implemented. Good luck with that !

Coingig is US only, or at least there is no option to search by country. For me it's far away from bitmit. There is still no substitute of bitmit so far and I'm very sad about it.

What are pros and cons versus LastPass ?
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:35:11
I'm not doing it but I guess you should never sell everything at once. Play with stairs, buy a small amount every x steps and sell on steps starting higher than the highest one on buy. The just wait a few hours and see the results. You should keep reserver on both side to be ready to react on a peak or dip. If you don't act to stupidly you should have chance to win higher to 50% in the long term. It's just some suggestions to think about, not science. Take it or leave it.

Why don't you compare it to an Armory Offline Wallet ? Has I had understand it when the idea of Trezor came out it was to do the same as an offline wallet, with the possibility to sign a transaction offline then transfert to an online computer to excecute the transaction. So for me it looks like an offline wallet on an offline computer without the need to carry a full computer and juggling with USB key to sign a transaction. Am I right ?

If such a program would work they will not push it public but using it to the bone at it's maximum. Pushing it to public means that the profit will be made from user and not to user, so only one person (company) is going to be rich at the end.

So much talk about using an international unit notation that was use before we invent the first computer. It's like if you were talking about meter en then you have to measure something small, like 0.003m so you said 3mm, pure logical. It must just be an habit to do on everyday, not so much to talk about it.

Thanks, but also I see no option to sort by country. Almost all the stuff are digital and there rest seams only from US too. On BitMit you could choose the country of the seller, the country where you can be delivered and even the currency. Was a great piece of software, hope the code will be available to someone else to continue the it on a way or another.
@_date: 2013-11-28 07:51:31
I've found it already but there is no possibility to sort by country and it seams to have only object from US anyway.

I would have done the same, as soon as my bitcoin can pay for a nice flat and a Tesla S I will sold my soul and go back to losing value items like that. The best would be to be able to spend half of the bitcoin for housing and keep the rest for the future.
