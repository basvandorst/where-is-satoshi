I'll be turning my IRA into 100% bitcoin with this

Don't you guys have like the worst internet ever?

last thursday at 3:06pm was a good time
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:23:17
Go ahead and try it and report back
@_date: 2014-06-21 05:01:03
That's very interesting.  I didn't know that's how it works.
@_date: 2014-08-13 15:01:21
Don't do that again

You.  You may have multiple personality disorder

I opened a ticket.  Really hope someone will answer soon.  Went to the irc channel too but that was worthless

Why do I have to provide my Social?
@_date: 2014-02-18 12:15:33
I don't want to watch a damn video.  What's the restaurant?

He still manages to come to an uninformed conclusion.  The hashing power behind bitcoin is more massive than the largest supercomputer ever built by an order of magnitude.  Bitcoin will NOT be replaced by "some new thing", at least not within our lifetime

@_date: 2014-02-10 21:50:04
Me too, your site rocks!
@_date: 2014-08-01 21:32:49
I would like to know aswell.  And what's a 10 Run Moving Average?
@_date: 2014-02-15 14:16:20
Would it have killed them to put a little makeup on the guy?
@_date: 2014-01-22 21:26:38
The Internet never stopped growing rapidly.  Bitcoin isn't a company that operates on the Internet and you're buying its stock.  It IS the Internet.
@_date: 2014-07-08 13:10:12
Why?  That's dumb
@_date: 2014-06-20 17:54:08
Zoom out
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:51:23
Also a great reason to fabricate a story and ruin someone's life

That they are in Hong Kong

Salaries undoubtedly 
@_date: 2014-06-19 11:12:45
So they could now theoretically contact each other and make a deal to buy all the bitcoin for $1 and then split the proceeds
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:21:26
Yes, yes it is, and I'm not sure how this will prevent a 51% attack
@_date: 2014-06-04 21:02:40
Does she take Bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-03-31 04:18:44
Totally makes sense
@_date: 2014-05-30 14:15:58
Totally not a scam

What hashtag should we use?

"How do we regulate mining?"  ...You don't.  It just goes overseas, idiot.
@_date: 2014-01-29 21:35:53
Can someone explain the "bitcorn" reference?
@_date: 2014-08-13 14:56:34
Seems like a perfect way to use bitcoin.  Someone build this...
@_date: 2014-01-29 04:27:21
I see what you did there
@_date: 2014-01-10 20:31:37
This guy -----&gt;

He should sell his computer to feed his family.  Or stop surging and go find a job

WHAT A MORON

I was hoping not to

The second that MTGOX opens up witdrawals, the price of Bitcoin will drop to close to $0 because EVERYONE will pull their Bitcoin out of the exchange and there will be no one left to buy.  
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:30:18
So only people who don't care about money are in here then?  Is that it?
@_date: 2014-04-07 14:16:40
Does he though?  Does he really?
@_date: 2014-06-21 05:02:32
I think mass adoption will take longer than we think because I consider myself a smart person among my peers and my brains still gets a little fuzzy this this kind of stuff and things
@_date: 2014-02-18 14:16:11
Sounds terrible
@_date: 2014-08-08 14:02:09
Yes.  Don't.

the TCP protocol hasn't changed since inception.

It's a win-win

mining is not in any way profitable at the prices that GHS is priced at

Oh boy will they be in for a surprise

The dude wears a bow tie.  That's all you need to know
@_date: 2014-06-29 14:09:13
No.  That won't work.

um, reddit isn't decentralized...
@_date: 2014-03-21 03:50:44
wait wait wait, hold on a second here...  They stored their coins on the internet in a file called "wallet"???  Was the password "password"?  
@_date: 2014-04-09 23:26:32
How long did it take to get there?  4 years.  Now lets put that into perspective against the other currencies...
@_date: 2014-01-03 15:54:49
LOVE IT

Well that's embarrassing

SEIZE HIM!!!

If you borrow someone's money and then lose it by being a complete moron, there is no recourse?
@_date: 2014-05-29 15:04:42
You gotta fix that "too much data" crap.  We should be able to backtest any time interval for at least a year

Also, max out your credit cards, mortgage your house and then buy as much as you can on triple margin

The BTC/USD price is determined by a lot of things but one of the main things is how easy it is to transfer fiat in and out.  The harder it is, the more expensive bitcoin will be in relation to USD.  MTGOX usually has a price for Bitcoin that's about $100 higher than Coinbase.  However, I can transfer USD in and out of Coinbase within a few days, whereas MTGOX takes up to 6 months and the money sometimes disappears mid-transfer.

You should include the alphanumeric address rather than just an image.  Some of us have iPhones.

Now it's at $620

Unfortunately, all they want is our Bitcoin

That's some good eatin'
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:39:26
Why would you keep 10 BTC in an account without 2FA enabled?
@_date: 2013-12-22 05:00:04
Uh, doesn't this explain it?  
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:39:20
It works until it doesn't
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:45:55
Yeah I checked them out too.  They do have a slick interface, but I prefer interest on my fiat.
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:38:09
How long ago?

You have got to start eating healthier, bro
@_date: 2013-12-21 03:00:29
I kind of agree.  Which is why I posted this a few days ago.

Painted pillows?  Oh wow.  Such crust.  Much paint flakes.
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:20:27
How do you pull in that coinbase price?
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:38:35
Did you verify your account?

I've used that combo to buy Bitcoins but not to sell.
@_date: 2013-12-19 22:20:18
They're too dumb there.  I know cause I'm cuban.
Plus no one has a mobile phone, a computer or even a loaf of bread (unless you're part of the government).
@_date: 2013-12-13 14:35:55
I like where you're going with this... 
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:41:47
I haven't either...  yet.  I just don't want to wake up next week after some "compliance department" guy decided to audit my account and find that I can't get my money out of it.  That would not be fun.
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:25:36
Great site!
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:31:22
Curious about this as well.  Don't more clients mean faster transactions because more confirmations are available on the network?
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:21:18
Can you send us the link too?
@_date: 2013-12-18 21:46:32
They can operate however they want, but it is MY money.  They shouldn't be able to just freeze my account and hold my money indefinitely because they feel like it.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:32:56
When will all this ending end?
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:46:35
You're not looking too hard 
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:15:54
You should have ordered one from Ebay and paid twice as much as retail price like I did
@_date: 2013-12-21 03:56:15
So tired of these "listen to my opinion" articles.  Who the hell cares about some uninformed moron's opinion that's too lazy to research anything or write more than three paragraphs?
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:01:25
I do.  I'm going to test them against some other pools this week.
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:25:07
Exactly.  She chose money over you?  She obviously doesn't love you.
@_date: 2013-12-20 04:19:46
Have an upvote, sir
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:56:56
You should use Cryptsy or BTC-E
