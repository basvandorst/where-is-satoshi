 since 1 bitcion = 100,000,000 satoshi

What happens when Bitcoin is all mined out. The fees was supposed to be there as an incentives miners. No one is going to stake energy for free. There's a reason why people are more interested in lightning nodes than regular node because you can earn fees over-time.

The value of fiat will drop due to inflation. Bitcoin is deflationary. 
 The 30% drop is the pair against USD/BTC. Which Is not relevant here. 
In theory the purchasing power of fiat will constantly decrease due to the ever increasing money supply while purchasing power of Bitcoin will increase overtime.

@_date: 2017-12-18 10:28:28
Real question, what happens to the value of USD when Bitcoin hits $400,000. Will a loaf of bread cost $100? A simple house to cost 4,000,000?

@_date: 2017-12-18 14:39:50
Doesn't really tbh.... The max will still be 21 million BTC. I would rather the coins to not be loss.  21 million isnt a lot the statoshi's coin going back into circulation is probably not a bad thing. It can be used to do more good. Maybe pineapple fund or something. Just my 2 satoshis 
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:34:51
There is no real bitcoin. The only real bitcoin is the one you support by running a node. 
  
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:07:55
Fiat is worthless because it can be printed at will. Bitcoin have a hard cap of 21 million.

Hey OP make sure you make a backup of the private key in case your family lost it.

Pretty sure lnd is suppose to resolve this by auto piloting the channels in the network. That will ensure your node is well connected. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 04:49:56
That's your expectation. The reality is you ride the 5% sell, wait for dip. Dip never came,Bitcoin tops 30% and it never came back to your selling price. You feel sad and depress because you sold your Bitcoin at 8k when it's ath and now it's climbing to 10,12,15,18,20k.
 Bottom line is you never know where the top is at. I sold my btc at 3k during ath. Only to buy it back around 5k. I have less Bitcoin now because I day trade. I KNOW IM A BAD TRADER. That's why I HODL BECUZ IM NOT A GOD TRADER LIKE YOU. I HODDDDLLLLLL

AA mentioned openning mutiple channels with auto pilot but if you're poor AF isn't it kinda useless to have channels with few satoshis. Since you can't route (no fees to earn)
