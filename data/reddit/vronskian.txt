It's most certainly the database. They have managed to set the trading flow right so that there's no duplicate transactions but seems they've tried to synchronize the trades so well it turned out people using the site locks the database, and then everything times out (deadlocks on a database time out after some time).
API users are probably more efficient at spamming orders and manage to execute the order before a deadlock occurs.
I believe they had some issue in the past and then started putting locks all over the place, so even just trying to load the site (reading the data that does not need locks) makes a deadlock happen due to being unnecessarily careful.
Deadlock issues are really not that hard to solve. They can cripple the trading engine by sequentializing all orders but well, seems they're stuck, or maybe rewriting everything from scratch, which will just introduce more bugs in some other places.

That comment implies there's a massive increase in CPU required for the Graphene method which would imply higher latency.
I'm not that convinced it's the case.
It also talks about restructuring of the p2p  network, of which I can't find any mention in the graphene paper.

why did any of them get access to bitcoin core? immature, average programmers.
wtf did gavin do?

It has fees.
There's no attack, just a bunch of rich fucks scaring the cowards away from bitcoin and alts into bitcoin cash.
No one can easily fuck up 120 billion market cap without everyone crapping their pants and no longer trusting in bitcoin.

If people keep buying BTC with their BCH then BTC price will rise.
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:35:48
Absolutely, I don't get it why people are selling BCH. They are only allowing for more manipulation.
Very idiotic IMO.

big block size is a thing of storage, not computational power. ASIC powered POW alg is also quite a compromise on democracy and liberty IMO, much bigger than blocksize.

How does it take time if most of the time it's not a 1MB block that is being sent but a practical diff that is &lt;100kB?
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:09:42
Why exactly are you selling? You're only making money for the pumpers.
You do realize that by selling you probably get your BCH in the hands of the pumpers that then just pump it all up all over the exchanges.

Adam Back and Pieter Wuille were for blocksize increases.
It is a solution, not the only one but still an elegant one.
I believe off-chain scaling solutions will be a third-party, zero privacy lockdown in most cases.

Well, there were cases where volatility increased, like oil, since the introduction of futures. But you can never know what is the cause of the volatility. So, in theory, everything can happen, some scenarios more probable than others.

There's no BTC being bought or sold. Only cash profit exchanged.
You agree to buy or sell BTC but you just pay or receive the difference in fiat.

satoshidice is a gambling site where you send BTC, now BCH, to an address and you get BTC, now BCH, back if you won. Problem was that people were paying $5 for a transaction fee while betting 0.000001BTC. Site was probably not having any customers then.

Here's an interesting discussion in Monero subreddit from a week ago.
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:29:46
I believe there's an explicit statement in the paper on allowing ordering of transactions in any way you want. There's an implicit ordering by ids that requires no additional data, and explicit ordering that requires the ordering data to be sent. Ordering data is extremely small even if the node you're sending the data didn't see thousands of transactions, which is highly unlikely anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:32:32
What's the problem in huge blocksize? Storage?
Wouldn't a proper solution for storage be to just abandon 50% of blockchain every couple of years?
For currencies like Monero where everything is practically invisible, there's no need for old stuff in the blockchain, yet they still keep it (I guess it's still small enough).
Would this be a security issue?

This should decrease volatility since there's less traffic buying bitcoin directly, but will of course move the volatility to the futures market. Although, anything can happen in theory.

Well, Gavin not being active is an okay reason, but many of the current core members have nowhere near the activity of Gavin.
Gregory Maxwell has like an abysmal lines of code committed into core and most of core projects that list him as a significant contributor are useless.
And he's like one of the more prominent members.
It's definitely the case they lost a very good contributor to the project but I believe he obviously didn't wish to have a part in it even before the CW is Satoshi incident.
Bitcoin is definitely an interesting open source project to watch from a management perspective. There's a bunch of money around it but I do not think there's that many good engineers (compared to Linux kernel) as there could be. Of course, my impression might be wrong and I'd like to see some revealing examples.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:29:56
Well, I'm pretty sure I'm far away from a shill. Maybe you were talking to Oh you did too. Well, I'm not sure what's wrong with being realistic? No one is saying you should switch to using something else, it's just that the use case that was proposed in the initial version of BTC is no longer valid.
That's it.

btc is not under attack, it's just some huge holders having fun with the market and irrational fears and using it to earn money.
imagine how much profit they gained by buying off all that BCH for $800 or $1000, when the price will skyrocket in a year. imagine how many ppl got scared and sold off their btc for bch and pushed the btc price down. enough for those wrecking havoc to buy it cheaply.
cryptocurrencies are here to stay, there's no deeply thought out conspiracy. no serious take over attempts.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:41:33
Of course, the only way for the price to equalize would be that someone buys BCH with huge amounts of fiat, or if people start selling BTC for BCH. I do not think that scenario is realistic.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:16:23
Well, BTC has a huge ecosystem, companies are using it, there's a bunch of development around it (outside of core), people are using it all over the world. It's not speculation as EOS or IOTA or whatever.

No crypto coins have anywhere near of an adoption as bitcoin. So btc was probably the closest thing to being used as a currency.
Any other coin is months if not years away from being as hyped up as btc, to a level where you could pay your coffee with it.

I'm not saying he is now active or was active at the time. He was active, reached enormous amounts of activity and then stopped contributing. That period of no activity is valid criticism, as you can see I mentioned it as an okay reason of having his repository access revoked.
I'm just saying that if we were to compare his reached activity, by the activity of some core members, they would be ridiculously dwarfed.
I'm not a shill, I'm not even familiar with the word. I do not even understand what exactly am I misinforming about? I even pleaded for some contrary information and expressed doubt about my personal impression.

How is this attack going to work if BTC mempool is overpopulated, so no arbitrage opportunity or flooding the exchange with bunch of coins?
How is this going to work too if BCH is about to fork and it's risky to do transactions during fork?

Well, from the start, you need to wait around 10 minutes for confirmation. No matter the size of the block. If block was 1GB it would still be 10 minutes.

They own the right to buy/sell bitcoin.
They pay a fee of X in any fiat currency to have a right to buy/sell N bitcoins for a predetermined price Y after some timespan.
If you wanted to sell 100 BTC for $4000 each year ago, and made a futures contract paying a fee of $200, you wouldn't sell them today when they are worth more. In order to sell them you have to buy 100 BTC per todays price and sell it for $4000. You'd only be losing $200 bucks if you decide not to waste your money.
If you wanted to sell 100 BTC for $10.000 each year ago, and made a futures contract (meaning that person who made it with you has to buy it from you today by the agreed upon price), you would sell them today but instead of buying 100BTC and then selling them you will be paid just the profit.
People can also sell these *rights* to each other if they no longer feel confident they'll execute the futures contract in the future.
You can also make a futures contract that is an agreement to buy another futures contract. That's how you get bubbles.

But average user can't set up a miner and support the system. You have ASIC powered miners that obliterate all GPUs. You need to join mining pools.
This centralization argument for storage does not hold any weight. You can have multiple nodes acting with a single blockchain loaded somewhere. Someone can even offer a service where blockchain is stored on a distributed storage system (let's say blockchain explodes to TB of data) and independent CPU/GPU/ASIC nodes can just sync over that storage system without having to suck all that data in. 
As for bandwidth, that's only for the initial load. There's already a constant size diff update in BTC where you don't need to send whole blocks over the wire.
Of course, long term, any kind of ledger system that has a history of all transactions does not scale well, so long term we can say that BTC will come to the equivalent issue even with 1MB blocksize, even with 2nd layer solutions.

Graphene paper was not posted on arxiv, there's also no mention of minimum spanning tree or p2p network restructuring in graphene paper.
So I'm not sure if you're talking about the same thing.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:24:56


Given the meager hashrate of your node, the expected time necessary for you to mine that 1 BTC (which is the only prize amount) is measured in years.


So mining pools are okay for computation rewards but the same solution for storage isn't?
Someone could have complained about difficulty adjustment leading to centralization of computation power (mining pools), yet they didn't.


What average user? No one has a full node for their own wallet management? An average user doesn't even know how to setup a cold wallet. An average user uses Netflix instead of torrents, uses prorietary software instead of free. Average user won't be running mining software and having full nodes on their PCs.
I'm pretty sure that average price of mining equipment that currently mines on BTC blockchain is way over the price of an average PC.

Well, future is an obligation to the other side. The other side has to buy or sell you the thing according to the agreement. You have a right to execute it or not.
