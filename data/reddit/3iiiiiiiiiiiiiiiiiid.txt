Sounds like you just aren't paying attention.

"No problems" is a bit of a glossy picture compared to reality. Remember: Bitcoin uses a P2P network, and it is a payment method. Here are a few examples which have been copy/pasted all over the Internet recently. I've added links to the ones I could cite and removed the one I couldn't find a source for:
* 2005 - Madison River Communications was blocking VOIP services. The FCC put a stop to it. [Link](
* **2005 - Comcast was denying access to p2p services without notifying customers. [link](
* 2007-2009 - AT&amp;T was having Skype and other VOIPs blocked because they didn't like there was competition for their cellphones. [link](
* 2011 - MetroPCS tried to block all streaming except youtube. (edit: they actually sued the FCC over this) [link](
* **2011-2013, AT&amp;T, Sprint, and Verizon were blocking access to Google Wallet because it competed with their bullshit. edit: this one happened literally months after the trio were busted collaborating with Google to block apps from the android marketplace [link](
* 2012, Verizon was demanding google block tethering apps on android because it let owners avoid their $20 tethering fee. This was despite guaranteeing they wouldn't do that as part of a winning bid on an airwaves auction. (edit: they were fined $1.25million over this) [link](
* 2012, AT&amp;T - tried to block access to FaceTime unless customers paid more money. [link](
I deleted the last one from the list because I can't find a source for it.

That's their own fault. They shouldn't promise to do things if they aren't going to do it. Handing them more money hand over fist isn't helping either. The Federal government gives out stimulus money to get ISPs to install infrastructure so public resources have gigabit internet. The ISPs still like to double-bill and fail to live up to the promises they made when they asked for the funding. They should be held to the terms of their own promises, not given more freebies like eliminating Net Neutrality.

You can't eliminate "The State" without putting into place an organization which _at least_ prevents its formation. Sure, there might be other names for it like "The Family," "Evil Corp," or "Bill and Ted's Excellent Enterprise." But a rose by any other name smells so sweet and a pile of turd doesn't smell more like chocolate the more you call it that.
Instead of pretending like government can be repealed without replacement, I'd rather focus my efforts on helping to shape _our_ government to better serve its citizens.
