The idea is it'd be good if everyone bought and held until it were fully adopted then starting to use it from there we have a decentralised currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:21:05
but you can't spend it
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:58:36
You said there wasn't a problem with the currency, regarding it's purchasing power, while we were discussing the *stability* of it ($US). 
You said a 2% inflation average is good. But what you're forgetting is that it's artificially being kept there by central-crooks who serve only themselves. Therefore, it certainly won't be stable in the long-run (reality).
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:48:41
OK then there's a huge undeniable problem with the $US currency in that it is centralized.

It's very new, and will become more stable once it's replaced old money. The volatility is in the transition, and once we've transitioned completely from fiat to cryptocurrency then it will no longer be volatile, due to "fiscal policy" (human error) not being a factor, like OP said. It is predetermined and decentralised ie mathematically predictable and stable.

Cryptocurrency (50% BiTCoin) has a $500-600USBillionDollar Market Cap making it the 3rd largest "corporation" behind Apple and Google and at 9yrs it's the youngest even though it's not a corporation, is shared by the people, is still making as much money, is only used by 1% of the population, is still growing--
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:36:09
It's the current "gold" of cryptocurrency. You keep your major savings in Bitcoin because the network is large and dependable, and use something like Litecoin for smaller money. 
Bitcoin will eventually adapt to be cheap and fast anyway, it's just getting started.

THE DISCUSSION IS STABILITY: THE US DOLLAR IS UNSTABLE BECAUSE CROOKS ARE FUCKING WITH IT
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:33:59
If the $US crashes again, if there's another global financial crisis, if the banks need another bailout, it's over for the $US. The reason this can happen in the first place is because the $US is controlled and manipulated by a few crooks, not because of some unforeseen circumstance or bad fiscal policy. The whole system is fucked. 
Bitcoin on the other hand is an alternative to all of these problems. This is what I'm talking about when I say stability. And Bitcoin will become more stable the more it is adopted. Once it is the world's currency, it should be successful because it isn't be privy to human-error. It will save the world. Take back the money from the banks and give it back to the people. People Power! Viva la Revolucion!!!
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:57:53
Yes. Bitcoin is currently more volatile, obviously, nevertheless it is a safer place to store your money than keeping it in $US, in a bank or otherwise. Bitcoin will eventually be stable once it replaces fiat and people quit trading Bitcoin for fiat. They'll stay with Bitcoin eventually. 
The banks won't get a bailout next time, what do you think's going to happen to the $US then? plus the US government/citizens are in phenomenal debt themselves... there is no debt with Bitcoin. It's a different game. It is the currency of the future.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:15:45
Well said! Very good post! Thank you, we appreciate it.

@_date: 2017-12-21 05:41:55
yeah mon!
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:42:46
That's stage 2.
 
Stage 1 is having a stored currency that grows instead of shrinks, as it isn't corrupted or manipulated by central authorities. No human error = dependable.
That's when it stabilises, when "storage" is saturated. By then we will have improved it, reducing fees and transaction times, and that's when  
we spend it: when you can afford what you need, and keep enough invested for the future. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:45:59

@_date: 2017-12-18 05:26:30

@_date: 2017-12-06 21:22:21
Reality. Bitcoin or cryptocurrency will be the new form of money, and whatever value we assign to it will have to be compared to gold, which always has and always will exist.

*u too*
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:37:37
There was always going to be hangers on... Don't forget this thing is will change the world and everyone's involved, even those that Bitcoin will eventually remove:
 
Banks:   long-term Exchanges and Traders
Speculative gambling:   **Wall Street**
Government:   Taxes
They'll all be part of Bitcoin's story until Bitcoin's become the general currency.
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:09:36
It's alright bro. It's a win-win investment or no investment as the power is returned to the people from the banks. Put small amounts in anyway, your money will grow there unlike in a bank.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:27:31
If you've invested in Bitcoin or Apple (BTC offline, Apple shares online) the value goes up as people use the "product" (remember BTC is valuable because we trust it as a democratic unit of currency, based on Aristotle's definition of money: durable, divisible, portable, intrinsic value (Bitcoin is verifiable code of money-data. Proven and trustworthy, it's the newest best money), so your proportion is worth more and you sell at a higher price - once it stabilises, once 3rd parties are taken out of the picture, we all have a more even distribution of the wealth, we use it for small purchases taking what we can afford from the top and holding the majority in a safer account), then after all that we'll move onto the next evolution, moneyless tantric orgies. 
And so when it stabilises we see there IS an abundance on Earth if we only realigned our needs more humbly there's more than enough for everyone. The sky is a living artwork. We can make personal aircraft from hemp and renewable energy!

Well that's another matter. Besides, in 5 years cryptocurrency will have completely taken over. Fiat hasn't got long left. 
There ARE other countries besides the West, you know, who are undoubtedly benefitting from Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-24 05:54:26
Keeping your money in a bank is an even bigger gamble because that bank can go bankrupt and the government might not bail them out next time. Being your own bank is a better gamble. Learn the technology.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:27:38
If something's inherently flawed and corruptible it is unstable. The definition of stable is what's being miscommunicated here.
Do you think the banks needing bailout 10 years ago helps or hinders the $US stability argument. It's unstable and will fail again.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:02:52
Fuck hegemony, it's death is underway. Get with the times, fiat money is for fools. Cryptocurrency isn't just a bubble that will burst and disappear. It is the new form of money, and it is the pin that will burst the bubble of our current economy. We HODL not to get rich, but to literally vote with our dollars, for equality and independence.

something positive to think about is that if a family who aren't of the brink of poverty hold their savings in bitcoin it's somewhat more assuring that it'll be around the same value when they come back to it - once it's fully adopted it'll be somewhat stable - and the gov aren't gonna use it to bail the banks out

HODLING literally means the banks don't have your money. That's what it all comes down to.

Nevermind, fees ARE high and transactions slow (for small tx), but it's just getting started. If the large bank accounts of the world treat it like the "gold" of cryptocurrency and store their money there, it will give Bitcoin a good foundation. You keep your major savings in it because the network is large and dependable, and instead, for now, use something like Litecoin for smaller tx.

Yeah, if they need expensive medicine, paying a fee on top of that already-expensive-but-accessible-lifesaving-product is worth the fee -at least they *can* buy it, plus bitcoin grows, so the fee might be covered with that growth. Better than useless Venezuelan dollars etc

I'm similar, but because my family and I have always lived rent and job free in my mother-in-law's granny flat I've been allowed to deal with my mental health issues with a lot less pressure, nevertheless it's still very difficult, yet I want to relate that from this position of "privilege" I still found that the only real help I've found is in nature and socialising, which come free.

In the last hundred years Western fiat has crashed once extremely bad and often times very bad. It hasn't done that since cryptocurrencies have been around, and next time it crashes, people will put their money in crypto. Crypto isn't manipulated like fiat, and isn't prone to mistakes, it's determined and dependable. Crypto will gather fiat every time fiat crashes and eventually be bigger than it. At which time the money will be more evenly distributed by the people, and the bankers, crooks, and war mongers will be out of power.
