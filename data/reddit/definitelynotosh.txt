This is a great idea!
I’m sure media will try to twist this amazing headline into “bitcoin crowd sourcing increasing extacy sales”. Make sure you are thorough and legit as possible with your endeavor and god speed to you.

This I could do. I don’t speak any other languages but I can easily make an ad in after effects and make original music for it.

I’d be happy to help in any way! Pm me!

How much anxiety has that bucket caused you?
@_date: 2018-01-13 06:52:55
I’d be happy to offer my services towards making said ads.

Oh, you’ll know.

XVG just saved my ass. Loving this.

That’s a wonderful idea! I have discord, if that would work.

TBH, I’m pretty ok with putting my money towards something that can help push the world in a direction that will at least lean towards removing federal banks. Even if I end up losing my entire life’s saving, at least I know that I put that money towards something I believed in and not something I knew wanted to hurt me.

And the worst of the thieves for that.

I hope crypto drives every single bank into the fucking ground. Fuck the hidden fees, fuck dealing with people losing your money, fuck the “oh yea, it didn’t process till today, so here’s your heafty overdraft fee”. I’m done! I think we all are! I’m 100% behind anything that will give ME the power over my money instead of putting it in the hands of someone trying to blindside me for a bigger plot of land.

This is six fucking hours dude, piss off.

How is this depressing? The more people who use it, the higher it gets valued as the more likely it gets used and adopted. How is that a bad thing?

I will upvote absolutely anything regarding teaching more people how to get into crypto.

Well then maybe we need more people out there educating people about the real world impacts of this technology than the potential short term gains. Hell, sign me up for that job.

Wow, what a great story Mark.

Way to bro, bro!
