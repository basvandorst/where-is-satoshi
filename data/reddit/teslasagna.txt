You must not be limiting your frames, my 1070 can play a few games at 4k at 60 fps, tho I typically stick with 1080
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:06:36
Damn. Looks like they haven't been able to keep up with the high volume of users who've recently jumped in the game :\

Wish I could use Kraken, but my state enacted regulatory fees on exchanges last year, so nearly every exchange pulled out of my state ��������

Ayup 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:09:59
I sold back in September during what was apparently a very brief dip. 
I've not bought since there because the lil bastard keeps sitting at the highest it's ever been.. ���� 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:22:04
I sold way the fuck back in September. Made a bunch of money, but, hardly anything compared to what I could have had I just held out.. 
Here's to putting some of our profit into the dip ��
.... Whenever that'll happen..
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:06:07
Ah. It was way better when I used it, though they probably have hundreds of thousands more users now 
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:23:18
Shush lmao I know that
I just meant what's scaring people/the big ass banks? Is there some major geopolitical shit going down, aside from Saudi Arabia's tantrum?
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:10:32
That is amazing. Thank you
@_date: 2018-08-08 19:11:28
Anyone know what's causing the drop? 
@_date: 2019-03-24 02:37:11
They've edited their post, so I'm thinking it looks different now compared to how you saw it - there's a username visible now 
@_date: 2019-04-03 03:07:16
Good on you man
@_date: 2018-02-17 07:45:25
Dead link is dead? 
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:30:41
I sold mine at 3800 a few weeks ago cuz I though it would drop.. Which it did, to 3000.. For like 6 hours, Shoot back up, and hey look at all that nice growth in the last week that I chose not to be apart of ����
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:37:48
Same here, I could've made several hundred more of I had sold earlier 
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:42:26
Copay! 
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:31:37
Your favorite RH theme was red? I don't quite get the reference heh
@_date: 2017-09-07 06:53:51
I feel like the price is going to jump again :0
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:32:20
@_date: 2017-10-01 03:26:33
I have learned things ��
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:34:11
Glad to see we're all having the same thoughts. Not sure if I should buy rn or wait 6 hours.. Pissed at myself for not rebuying a week ago, could've made $500 easy :(
@_date: 2017-09-30 23:23:22
Lmao it rose nearly $700 in the last week this is a rise
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:34:40
Oh hey, I'll do that! Thx :) 
@_date: 2017-10-09 04:57:01
So not coinbase? What about Copay? They have paperwallets too I think
@_date: 2017-10-01 15:36:05
I really need something for Ripple, Vericoin, and Lisk... But my state has strict regulation so my only other crypto site is Gemini :// 
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:20:01
Kicking myself for not buying a week ago, kicking myself for not buying two days ago, kicking myself for not buying yesterday morning. 
Because I know as soon as I buy it will dive and I'll be out hundreds ����
@_date: 2017-10-01 23:13:05

@_date: 2017-09-30 17:32:25
Wish I had bought 2 days ago, I could've made a few hundred usd :((( 
I'm waiting for a dip to buy in, but who know what'll happen this weekend
@_date: 2017-07-30 00:08:00
Idk why you feel like being an ass, just looking for help from fellow internet citizens 
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:59:21
$500 USD increase in TWELVE. HOURS. Whaaaaaaat
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:28:38
Just got my wallet set up! Cheers mate!  
@_date: 2017-07-30 00:57:25
Haha, whoops. Also I didn't know there was a coinbase sub, my bad
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:14:44
That lightning/euclair wallet app seems good 
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:02:28
So basically no reason to keep your coins there any more? 
How do I set up a personal private wallet? I downloaded eclair wallet but there are no tips or anything, it's the lightest ui I've ever seen 
@_date: 2017-07-30 00:02:37
Right but I don't even have a pending display, no info whatsoever that my request has even been processed. Obviously if I had an 'order pending' message or email I'd be fine. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 03:25:10
Hahaha 
@_date: 2017-07-29 23:57:30
5 fucking days??? Jesus Christ!
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:36:23
Ah, thank you ��
@_date: 2017-07-30 00:07:09
Oh hey, good loking out. Anything else I should know about? 
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:14:18
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:17:47
I too am a noob in this, even tho I've read a couple articles
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:11:24
Same, what's happening fork-wise?
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:08:44
Hahaha right? 
I'm peeved at myself for not buying during the 1800 fall, I expected it to fall one more time ��
@_date: 2017-07-29 23:55:02
How do I do that? Can I use the app or does that have to be on a pc?
@_date: 2017-07-30 00:03:34
Gotcha thanks, I'll look into that
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:55:53
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:22:07
Random bubble? Think it will drop heavily in two days?
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:18:15
What is this movie from tho
@_date: 2017-07-21 03:26:59
I too would like to know what's up, and I too have just a fraction over 2 btc
OP, do you also have a $2500 purchase limit on coinbase?
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:09:28
SAME. I saw the big jump yesterday and was like "Well it'll drop soon, that's not normal behavior" 
Then today has me like Pikachu
And Idk whether to just jump in now anyways, or give it a week, when it'll either be 5500 or 8700
