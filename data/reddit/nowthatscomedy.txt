Idk I don’t think you would need to open and close channels often since you could reach most people through hubs (one channel).
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:49:40
A lot of coins are but many will definitely be worth $100’s of billions. That’s just how big global assets classes are. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:27:35
Dude I’m a normie too. We should like hang out and stuff. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:33:26
Market cap is nevertheless the best yardstick we have. It connects supply to trading price. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:33:50
It’s a bill to ban exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:23:34
What exactly is the cashapp. Also does this app hold private keys for bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:13:45
I think I once read earlier last year he actually praised bitcoin as an idea. Listening to him speak it doesn’t sound he’s eager to ban it, which is good. However it seems countries want to join together to establish global tracking of flows and balances. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:26:05
But the value of BTC increased 10x so transaction consider that too.
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:56:11
I wasn’t too sure about what he was talking about in the end: centralization via hub-and-spoke is unlikely to occur, because of risk of being attacked for funds held, but nodes automatically rebalance. So does that mean if I have a large payment is can still be sent if their are no large hubs?
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:58:27
And a long time ago lol
@_date: 2018-01-05 05:51:33
A lot of people are pissed at high fees, not bitcoin itself. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:15:44
I think LN will impress people if we get some good “hubs” going. Everyone has an incentive to join, because it’ll be both fast and cheap. It’ll eventually be just like Venmo. 
Also, those hubs have to hold an enormous amount of bitcoin to allow volume. We’ll see huge buying from hubs just trying to get started. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:13:28
Instead of Frank Sinatra I’ll have to settle for Dino Spumoni. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:20:47
But that’s just negligence not spam right?
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:20:25
Yeah but we’re also millions of people more into it too. There’s value to that. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 02:10:43
Looking passed market cap, bitcoin is still really far ahead in terms of trust and adoption. Right now speculators are buying anything that looks cheap or has a fancy business mission statement. What will matter in 2018 and beyond is where do the institutional investors go. I think bitcoin will garner serious proportions of that money, as well as ETH. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:50:50
They don’t waste their time with the poor, that’s why they never get audited. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:49:26
But doesn’t a company collect fees in lightning network?
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:32:36
He can cash me outside 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:48:31
$8k prediction by Novogratz sounds fair. Also his $40k end of year sounds fair too. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:58:38
I have a super rudimentary understanding so forgive me, but then hardwallets have programs installed on them, and they must get some input when connected to the desktop to recognize when it needs to sign a transaction and show balances. That connection might be a bridge to exploit the chips vulnerabilities?
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:30:01
It seems nearing $14k is triggering a sell wall. We can’t break it yet, maybe the 4th try is the charm. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:54:25
That makes a lot of sense, but still, governments do stupid shit all the time so we'll see.
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:10:32
Ethereum has “undone” several high profile transactions it didn’t like. It’s not immutable. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:03:43
Blackrock used to say there was NO client interest back in the summer (lol).
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:00:53
So what’s the point? Marketing his book?
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:17:10
I disagree, that's not how markets work 
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:18:50
What you just said reminds me of of Jamie Dimon vs. JPM's research analyst. It's weird.
I work for a big financial corporation and contradicting the CEO would be a big no-no. But I guess if you were nuanced enough you could get away with it.
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:26:02
It’s all circumstances: if you’re young, not married, have no debts, and have a bit of retirement money, you can invest a pretty high percentage if you wanted to without it being a bad idea. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:56:56
Uh, wrong reply!
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:04:44
It means people are holding it as a store of value. Makes sense since there haven’t been many new stores accepting it and it is rapidly deflationary. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:51:55
They’re going to reassure themselves cryptos are worthless. You don’t go to Davos to make bold predictions or stick out from the herd. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:34:45
Back in the summer I remember Fink standing out as the only executive saying none of his clients were asking about bitcoin. Haha
Yeah they don’t want to look dumb since it appears so speculative, they probably still don’t understand it, and they have nothing to gain by endorsing it. 
I think Davos probably reinforced some confidence though as the elites discussed it between each other. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:40:20
How can you use a multiple to explain a fraction?
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:56:47
It’s when Santa does another round for the rich kids only 
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:55:15
People are venting about high fees and congestion, that's real dude.
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:26:03
This totally misrepresents the discussion. Those currencies aren’t minable because the supply is controlled by a central authority, bitcoin won’t be minable because 100% of bitcoin will have been mined. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:25:16
And then a drop to $4k right?
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:12:43
No way. Cryptos can be used for lending just like anything else you wish to deposit for interest. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:38:33
More important than features is the idea that people mutually agree something has value. That’s why we shouldn’t expect gold prices to dive to zero. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:54:47
Lol yeah OK
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:29:52
I think they just have no idea how to assess its risk or explain it to clients. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:30:57
Wow look at that it even has a progress tracker. Thanks
Any idea what the rate has been over time?
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:15:13
It’s nice how humor like this can actually serve as a reminder for confidence. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:40:01
This isn’t the only solution.
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:08:13
Why do they constantly need to caution "this isn't an investable asset, there's not fair value, you must be willing to lose your entire stake"
How about you guys adopt new valuation models? (ex: metcalf's law)
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:23:37
Isn’t mesh networking just the idea of routing through other users? A hub is a big router. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:51:53
I also don’t think Buffett seems interested in trying to understand.

Lol “going forward we will only be accepting new applicants on a 50/50 rate of men and women”
@_date: 2018-01-05 05:55:33
If you are young you can tolerate a high percentage of wealth in cryptos. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:42:21
So? We're expecting a bill is the point.
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:03:13
Try not to use Coinbase. They’re pretty terrible if you look past the app (i.e. fees, customer service, upgrades). 
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:52:33
Whenever this minister comments I just think of Zoolander. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:59:07
It’s a drop in the bucket (heh) but it helps
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:37:06
That doesn’t make it a good investment. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:40:22
Do me! Do me!
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:16:21
Only senders pay fees, are you in the business of sending bitcoin? Like a lot of small bitcoin transactions?
This sounds like a FUD troll
@_date: 2018-01-05 02:51:03
agreed, thanks for clarifying
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:00:04
No worries. People are selling only *because* it’s going down. The technology is still promising, the end markets are still huge, and regulation is still accommodative (mostly). 
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:18:18
Agreed. Ripple’s supply (and consequently market cap) should be cut by at least half. Bitcoin Cash I think too since much of it was lost through the fork. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:35:56
Well if you study the fathers of value investing, “intrinsic value” *is* value
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:21:25
That’s pricey though. But with hubs it’s much cheaper and they still can’t directly control any funds flowing through them, so it’s not that bad. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:34:52
Na, people invested in crypto like quadrupled since that time. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:36:11
It’s almost like it could be worth increasing the block size!? 
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:29:39
I am biased towards bitcoin, but the realistic side of me is that for bitcoin to flourish these fees and tx speeds need to come down. Bitcoin is too young to assume it has a cemented market position. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:34:04
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:15:07
What do you mean, price? A high price with low adoption would back up a theory of low supply.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:03:15
No that’s actually normal. Researchers who sell research for a living are supposed to remove themselves from conflicts of interest like that. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:53:09
Yeah it’s pretty clear they don’t intend to crack down. But who knows if they can’t practically implement KYC
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:41:25
Yeah only after they rattled the market so bad. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:31:41
Yeah they want the benefits of getting around sanctions but don’t want their citizens getting the benefit of protecting and controlling their wealth. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:20:10
Don’t listen to redditors for conspiracies. Futures volume is still too light to presume foul play on global crypto markets. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 03:05:25
There will likely be some discount given the large blocks you must buy. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:32:45
I'm afraid I still don't understand, can you explain?
@_date: 2018-01-26 00:42:53
How? The mempool is still high
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:43:49
I’m guessing because of its volatility that buyers and sellers need to periodically settle the price changes. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 23:07:04
I think I read they do 
@_date: 2018-01-27 22:38:25
Well I imagine it costs like nothing to include bitcoin once you already set up acceptance for others. It’s weird. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:10:59
People listen to them because they're big, not because they lead.
@_date: 2018-01-23 14:17:32
Then that’s not really crypto and it’s effectively just cash. You sacrifice your upside. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:32:45
This was always bound to happen, but it’s unnerving to see it due to high speculation in other coins. Like, Ripple is basically a startup and it’s coin is $80B? Ethereum has no big working Dapps and same valuation? It’s ridiculous. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:19:11
VPN + bitfinex maybe?
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:13:31
Do you know why you're invested in cryptos? It's a bet on tomorrow. If you need to see an investment fully fleshed out before betting money maybe you should stick to index funds.
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:36:06
So, if there are only a few major hubs and you have open channels with each of them, such that you are now connected to *anyone* you desire to transact with, then why would you ever look to settle? It would only cost you money to settle and for little/no reason. All your activities could take place on sidechains.
Who knows maybe in the future the thought of conducting on-chain transactions will be as crude as using the command prompt on windows.
The thought of all this makes me extremely excited and bullish on bitcoin's long term outlook.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:34:35
Miners want bigger blocks though. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:14:06
This was very insightful thanks
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:56:36
What scandal? 
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:14:25
At a certain age i feel people just stop trying to understand technology. He will never invest in it or learn it, so when people ask him for comment he does the conservative thing and calls it a bubble. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:46:00
I disagree, people aren’t buying it because they expect it to be money. It’s not finite nor the cheapest nor fastest. It’s speculation over it becoming a successful platform. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:02:46
...That doesn't make a good investment either
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:38:35
If you fund you channel with a hub then you're fine - you can use that one channel to pay anyone connected to it. Not bad?
It's "centralized" but that doesn't give them authority necessarily. They have no control over the transactions, they're just a conduit. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:34:00
Bitcoin only uses that much energy because it is economical to do so. If energy prices rise then miners will drop out.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:58:42
I’m not sure how to interpret this, is he being sarcastic? China did ban. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:46:41
Ethereum also can’t scale, isn’t finite, and has no successful Dapps yet. I like Bitcoin because at least you can measure definable end markets (gold, money)
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:52:54
The head of the justice department. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:49:10
This doesn’t make sense to me. They don’t have to wait to *consume* but when they get bonuses they surely invest it. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:17:07
They're not that crappy. Like I could cash out all my bitcoin at the current market price without ruining the market, so that's legitimate "wealth" I have.
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:30:50
They also said they have no authority to regulate it. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 03:03:45
Selling on a high way. Looking for adventure. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:34:29
I suppose testing. We already saw local bitcoins and BTC.com enable Segwit, I’m sure we’ll see more soon. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:39:17
Well they ARE constantly supporting it with updates (ex: Segwit) and new currencies. It beats a subscription. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:04:19
Well somebody has got to be right!
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:07:36
I’m curious if this push to identify crypto flows could eventually lead to a segmentation between “clean” and “unclean” bitcoin. Where if you cannot prove how you got bitcoin you cannot cash it in without penalties. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:45:22
I don’t think you understand bitcoin. No bitcoin is stored on your equipment. Your equipment stores the private key which entitles you for access to your balance on the public ledger. 
Generally you don’t want your wallet stored on equipment that is constantly connected to the internet. Holding the 12 word private key is as secure as it gets. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:01:03
All you have to do is hit refresh and then stop real quick. The text loads before the paywall. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 01:14:24
This is the kind of screwiness I could see in the future
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:32:54
Yeah investors want large payoffs and don’t care about fundamental analysis. This doesn’t seem healthy to me, because if we were getting a continued feed of big/sophisticated investors you would see bitcoin rising. Maybe big investors aren’t biting lately. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:48:53
Why do people post to Reddit with these questions?
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:42:30
Who cares Coinbase blows. Use Gemini it's cheaper and more reliable.
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:20:00
Yeah like IBM which he finally dumped, in exchange for Apple now which is a bit late. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:21:00
I would be very surprised at 3%

If you can convert to SOME crypto then shapeshift is good for good for trading crypto-to-crypto
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:43:22
Bitcoin is no longer an "experiment". That phase has passed. Now it is gaining legitimacy.
And it IS money. The only reason it's "not" is because the network is too congested, but this is a good problem, and development is addressing this.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:00:43

Elliott wave isn’t based on any real rationale. It’s just a shape people transpose on a price chart. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:15:48
You can choose whatever you wish but I think with the new tax law for 2018 it’s must be fifo. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:34:29
The shape of a price chart means shit. It depends on fundamentals. We DO know that signs up at exchanges are so high that they’re pausing new applicants. This is very bullish for the next few weeks/months. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:08:25
Worse than that: evidence shows the futures market is pretty small. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 06:08:01
Besides being time tested, bitcoin is the most palatable for institutional ownership. I think this ultimately determines which coins have a shot at becoming mature. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:27:01
Every exchange is so strained from high demand they even have to put a pause on new applications. 
They will use Segwit, but it will greatly help when bitcoin core releases their new updates to the bitcoin core wallet. This will serve as reference code for exchanges, saving a lot of testing and work. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:31:54
Flavors of the week may do that. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:35:25
So about a year since I've joined Coinbase, and all they've done is: add LTC, BCH and made instant fiat crediting for transactions. 
This is a friggen billion dollar company
@_date: 2018-01-05 06:10:14
I 100% agree with every word. Market cap != liquidity. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:43:39
At least it’s not due to anything (like a regulatory ban). This is just volatility/price discovery. There is no doubt that cryptos will be a multi trillion dollar asset class though, and if there are any consolidations bitcoin is likely to survive. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:23:33
Yeah I guess that’s the point; they’re supposed to be like physical coins, when you trade it away it’s gone. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:53:56
Yeah under normal circumstances, but if a virus can get that information from the chip itself I wouldn’t rule that out. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:22:29
It’s so easy to say “do your research” when it’s gonna be a leap of faith no matter what. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:00:56
Regulatory uncertainty from South Korea, China and France. The US and Germany called for global coordination. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:10:13
Lol bitcoin wasn’t “meant” to be paired with futures either. 
Thanks for that insult! 
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:21:20
It sounds like you need to better understand how hardwallets work: confiscating or even destroying it does not cost you your coin. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:44:40
Yeah this run has been unbelievable
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:39:46
I’d check this out, but you know: asshole and all. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:21:57
Crypto is largely seen as uncorrelated to other assets. It may stay that way. 
However if we hit a deep crisis where we have confidence in *capitalism* shaken again (like the crisis) then you can bet cryptos will see a huge boost. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:54:27
Because it’s legally a commodity not a currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:12:47
Dang he thinks traditional bankers still aren’t interested in this whole space because it’s digital? Wow
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:17:42
Yeah I kind of agree. It's really hard to get people to understand Bitcoin. Nevermind some side feature that requires opening/closing channels. The developers are going to have to make it really easy if not automatic.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:22:59
I used to be like you which makes this so funny.
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:45:36
The press is PINING to report this but it’s never quite true. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:52:27
Backed by full faith and credit of the United States of America duh. 
Jk, that “credit” is a liability
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:47:16
Just because bitcoin has a certain market cap doesn't mean it can be liquidated for anywhere near that value.
But on the flip side, that works in our favor. If someone wanted to buy $1B of bitcoin we'd see it go up in multiples very shortly.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:59:45
He always plays it conservative. He wants to be taken seriously I think. But he does appreciate the factors at play here and he does freely admit in liquidity squeezes you “could see bitcoin reach $100k, $200k levels”
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:49:06
Ideally yes but I’ve never seen that data available. If it isn’t available I’m still satisfied with this as “good enough”
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:16:18
Shorting bitcoin futures doesn’t move bitcoin prices 
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:40:33
Unlikely IMO given still-accelerating rates of volume and unique wallet growth. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:51:56
Yea, but then again I think people will just conceal their activity better. If you use an exchange that doesn’t track your identity then any crypto-to-crypto trade you make probably effectively cuts you off from the IRS’ chainanalysis tracking. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:43:34
Yes because the signs advertises it and it’s a damn business. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:56:22
This is the natural course of things. Speculators push it to maturity, and when it’s mature it’ll be less volatile and used more as a currency and store of value. But right now it’s not a practical currency or store of value, it’s a speculative investment!

Although it's fun to say "when the shoe-shine boy recommends a stock then I better get out!" that really isn't a good way to assess a bubble. Bitcoin is owned by probably less than 1% of people, with institutional investors still trying to get in, and bitcoin significantly undervalued compared to gold alone. Furthermore there's little evidence of widespread trading on margin to buy bitcoin. 
I don't see how this could be a bubble at all.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:20:53
They built businesses and cleared regulatory hurdles because they understood bitcoin needed infrastructure. They contributed for sure.

Yes I know thank you, I'm an analyst by profession and CFA. That general relationship isn't as applicable here because the institutional investors don't own bitcoin and will be largely segmented off into the futures exchange; meaning they can't arbitrage between actual bitcoin markets and futures markets. Also, even if they were in bitcoin markets, since there aren't really any open ways to short *actual* bitcoin you can't perform proper arbitrage. So basically not all the "pipes" for pressure-release exist.
My point is that futures prices are beholden to bitcoin markets and not vice versa. The tail doesn't wag the dog.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:51:37

That wasn’t my point but maybe think of it this way: with consumers having a viable alternative to a fiat currency that is prone to debasement, the government will be forced to act more fiscally responsible and save us pain from crisis. 
It may sound like a non-factor at first but this could prove to be powerful.

No one is selling you bitcoin, chill
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:53:56
No one knows! Many say it provides a way for some investors to short bitcoin, but I am not convinced it can actually pressure bitcoin downward (the only way to pressure bitcoin downward is borrowing bitcoin to sell it on the *bitcoin* market, which doesn't really exist yet).
The futures will be cash settled and be very short term (maybe like a day). But futures carry a cost! I think for any institutions that want to buy long term or in size will eventually have to go to coinbase or gemini for an institutional account (until an ETF comes).
Futures are really meant for investing/hedging in heavy or biodegradable commodities without paying for storage, like timber. It really doesn't make sense for a digital asset.
Though, futures will be nifty to hedge during key events.

@_date: 2017-12-22 18:10:41
In case my description didn’t show: it finally seems bitcoin is falling at a decreasing rate than the rest of the broader market. It also found some strong footing once it touched as low as ~$10k.

Well a marketplace has many different people, it’s not the same people saying that. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:56:51
Everytime bitcoin hits a major price milestone ($5k, $10k, $20k) a flood of selling is triggered. Then when it’s finally absorbed it gallops back up way past that threshold. If history is any indicator of future patterns, now is the time to buy. 
Edit: Usually the dip is around 20% before rebounding
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:05:39
But isn’t that offset by lower fees from increased capacity?

Exactly. The futures markets don’t directly impact the actual bitcoin market. It’s useful to think of it like people just making side bets on bitcoin price. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:48:52
This sounds like an update I’ve heard about which makes it significantly easier for the major players to utilize Segwit? However hearing you describe it it sounds like just the bitcoin core wallet...which I imagine not many people actually use as their wallet

Exactly. And given how far alts have run on such little use or development I am not betting on extended runs of growing hype. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 08:44:56
You should respect the fact that you still have no idea when this is coming out, and if the developers aren’t giving target dates (or target *years*) then that’s probably not indicative for 2018. 
Also, let’s not get rude here, it’s doesn’t reinforce your point. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 15:10:59

They fought hard. Sorry for them. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:56:00
Well what CME and CBOE worked so hard to achieve is making sure their benchmarks (which is an average of Gemini, GDAX, + 2 others) supervises for manipulation. Since these exchanges identify their customers they can report them since manipulation is illegal. 
That being said the rest of the market isn’t as regulated. But the manipulator would need a lot of volume to influence global average prices. Could happen. Maybe that’s why the futures volume isn’t as strong, investors are cautious. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:34:48

Agreed and nearly all exchanges do, but some don’t. They’re not based in the US. Banks cut them off so you can’t send fiat to them but provided you already have cryptos you can still transact. 
It’s still the Wild West, you just need to go “further west”
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:35:42
Everything comes in stages. Speculation is a necessary evil to climb up the S-curve adoption. Once it matures and stabilizes it will be more appealing to use as a medium of exchange. 
You have to be willing to believe we'll find a way to lower transaction costs, but that's a no-brainer bet to me.

If countries collectively agreed to ban it I wouldn’t doubt they could hunt down nodes and disrupt them in some way.

These other coins will have the same issue if they grew to bitcoins size. The problem is with blockchain not bitcoin.
Bitcoin is a strong crypto because it is miles ahead of any other in networking effect. Even though other currencies like bitcoin cash appear somewhat comparable by market cap, the fact is it doesn’t compare at all in terms of network depth.

Not quite true. Financial engineering is useful when you want to invest in something physical (lumber, gold) without the resources to store it. It’s also useful for bundling up debts like mortgages to get a certain desired exposure. 
Bitcoin is purely digital so there really isn’t a need for engineering. We have futures already, but there’s a cost to rolling them over and paying the administrator a fee. Holding bitcoin is the simplest and best bet.

I know this sounds crazy, but speculation is good and has always been a necessary evil to boost bitcoin to news headlines, propel wide adoption, and facilitate new services. There will be a bust eventually but it’s overall good. 
Bitcoin and the blockchain is unable to be used as an everyday currency. It’s very useful though as a store of value, especially as global government spending is getting out of control. 
Lightning network and rootstock may provide unexpected upside potential beyond store of value, but we’ll have to wait and see!
But anyway, I would just appreciate the adoption trends. Bitcoin will eventually be used and respected for the reasons you want in due time.

The government could really dampen price because law abiding institutions wouldn’t be able to convert to fiat.

Bitcoin really doesn’t have many services offering leverage, and typical retail investors don’t really buy much (&lt;$1k).

Human generally don't "go against the grain." They seek safety in crowds, and are inclined to imitate each other. Good skills for survival but not so much for investing.
Being a good investor is often a very lonely and independent endeavor. Often they just think differently, and sometimes happen to suffer from depression too. They hold contrary opinions based on what are usually simple principles in theory, but often lack the hard evidence to show their theory has real momentum. 
Then, if their investment does really well and impresses their colleagues and friends, it is usually too late to be worth entering. Alternative new ideas are ironically still given a skeptical eye. The process continues!

Not worried, it’s opportunity for everyone. Between how much influence the petroleum lobbyists have, how starved towns are for jobs, and the demand for higher capacity utility infrastructure, I can imagine a lot of towns will welcome mining companies with open arms.

I think this is a useful metric for telling when the weak hands have left. I think if bitcoin returns to say 60-70% then that feels more rational to me. No coins besides bitcoin and ethereum should be worth billions IMPO
@_date: 2018-08-12 01:02:03
Lol I knew you would say that which is why I chose my words carefully. You’re *borrowing* an asset, and paying *interest* on it, in the hopes of *magnifying* returns. You need to get approved for a *margin* account for approval. That’s 100% leverage.

It depend on their success and addressable end market. Bitcoin is money so that’s a pretty big market - several trillions. If Ethereum for example could be some general purpose blockchain platform and has many major and important blockchain applications running through it, it could be multi trillions as well. 
That being said I think Bitcoin reaching its end market has a much, much better probability over ethereum reaching such a stage.

I think there’s value in an ETF. Not everyone can (or wants) to learn the weaknesses of bitcoin and best practices to protect themselves. Further, most people don’t even know who to ask or trust for guidance.

Well gold went very up last time so crypto could do the same. Also, another reason for it to go up is that interest rates are still low so any Keynesian response would have to do with spending or printing...also bullish for bitcoin.

Companies aren’t based off their balance sheet, but their future earning power. If Bcash tanks then they can easily switch mining power to bitcoin or whatever else. Additionally, they’re focusing on AI hardware which is super-high in margins. 
The Bcash decision was stupid but the company has such a high lead with fairly low competition and is massively profitable. I don’t think they’re gonna suffer any more than any one else in the crypto space.

For iPhone I have Blockchain, Bitcoin.com's Bitcoin wallet, and Blue Wallet. 
* Blockchain is very nice and sleek, but requires heavy identification registration.
* Bitcoin.com's wallet is nice because it doesn't have ID registration, but it's hard to get all the BCH-related features and options out of my face, and is kind of annoying to navigate. Plus Roger.
* Blue Wallet is new and probably my favorite so far, it sticks to the basics and I like that. It has segwit which is awesome, no ID registration, and is open source. The only thing though is it's sort of buggy, like the part of the receive-QR code is cut off of the screen.

Agreed. Although we all want rapid price growth, a slow-but-steady growth indicates this is real demand and is less likely to reverse down sharply.

Your assumptions are really bad. Real estate isn’t immune to lower prices because “people need a place to live!” If your renters are making less or unemployed, you’re bargaining power for rent goes down. 
Also that wealth inequality statement makes no sense since the rich own all kinda of financial assets, especially stocks. 
Also “stock market go down what do bitcoin do?!” Is a bad question because it depends why the stock market is going down. This reason may determine whether bitcoin falls with it or rises. 
@_date: 2018-05-10 02:47:34
Interesting thought. If the US thought Iran was using cryptos to bypass, I think there would be an expedient legislations passed to regulate exchanges. Could be a good thing in terms of legal clarity.

Their prices in local currencies so the volume could be stable or even down. Bitcoin is also down so that’s not useful either. You need to denominate it in dollars at each time point's rate to see how volumes have really been doing.

Dude, Tom Lee is definitely legit. He has a good track record of going against the grain with stock calls (which is risky in financial sell-side research) and has held a top position in JP Morgan before starting his fund. He was also partially right when he made his first crypto call of $6k by YE 2017, although of course it went much higher (whether he was right or wrong, or something in-between is up to you).
Personally, I highly respect his analytical framework and data analysis. If you follow him you can hear him discuss considerations for metcalf's law, demographic behaviors, competition trends among banks/exchanges, as well as the bitcoin internal metrics like wallet growth. He also created a "Bitcoin sentiment index" and analyzed the possible impact of liquidity squeezes (from historic examples in oil markets), which are interesting topics. But at any rate, this is how high quality research analysts think.
Again, short term price predictions are tough and you should assess an analyst's quality based on whether you think they've constructed a credible theory based on good points..and if you're willing to bet money off it. Of course it boils down to a single number (price target by X date), and while they could be wrong, a lot more sophisticated thought goes behind a price target than some random dude off reddit so not all opinions are equal.

This is a 30 minute read but the most exciting article for bitcoin I have read, probably ever. It’s finally feels like it's happening. Bakkt is a division of ICE that’s been in the works for 14 months. They're planning to offer **exchange, custody,** and **wallet** service for **people, retailers, and large asset managers** across the world. The ICE chairman seeks to bring bitcoin mainstream as a **global currency** and cut out wire fees and credit card fees. 
The partners are all top notch and cover everything: Starbucks for a strong entry into a national retail network, ICE for exchange/custody, Microsoft for programming (the wallet app I suppose), Boston Consulting Group to organize the business to efficiency....and financial managers such as Fortress, Susquehanna, and such for market making, additional financing, and connections. 
While Starbucks may look to convert to USD immediately for now, have no doubt this is THE biggest forray into mainstream yet. Definitely more "important" than an ETF. Bitcoin should be worth double right now on this news in my opinion (not saying it will though!)
Amazing times. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 20:15:06
That is a LOT of money. I wonder what they’re gonna do, and when. 
@_date: 2018-08-05 17:30:49
To be fair I expect that it can process faster (second layer trading) and is better insured against counterparty risk (no clawbacks). You won’t have to worry about the exchange losing or stealing your coin with ICE. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 03:35:40
Why wouldn’t the bitcoin awareness be higher, you think?
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:00:22
Inflation is when a currency loses pricing power. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 18:10:41
It is in my opinion. Manipulation ruins confidence in a fair market and makes it hard for even experienced investors to assess the real underlying activity.  
Added downside volatility also discourages retail investors to enter, and causes holders unnecessary FUD causing them to make stupid decisions. Institutional investors also don’t like volatility, all else equal. 
People who engage in manipulations obviously hate this move. So do people who hate government more than malfeasance (ex: libertarians). 
Sure, some money will leave because the game is more restricted. But that money was only to fuck around with the market, and makes it more expensive for serious holders to buy more bitcoin. I think years from now this will be better for the composition of investor types holding bitcoin. 
This doesn’t cut down bitcoins upside potential, because the quantity of bitcoin is still finite and big institutional money has yet to enter. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 03:58:59
Gold will lose relevancy in the future as money. It already has, and there's no reason to go back. It's basically like a rock...you can't practically divide it, carry it, or conveniently hide it. 
Cryptocurrencies are a nice and better replacement for gold.
@_date: 2018-05-07 17:19:00
Yeah, I’ve never heard them voice such a strong opinion and in a way that doesnt even make sense. It’s weird Bill Gates scathes it now too. 
Probably the prevailing popular opinion of the old boys club? Maybe it’s because they’re too rich to see a need? Maybe it’s too outside of their lifetime experience and seems weird or stupid? Maybe theirs a financial conflict of interest?
Dimon was odd to call it a fraud too. It probably is due to conflict of interest.

Similar with the news industry, if you work for a corporation you get easy points for pretending to be serious about tail risks. Meanwhile you risk your career if you're bullish on something that doesn't pan out. That's why all major news outlets and major company executives shit on cryptos but few are bullish.

As a nationally used second layer it will probably further adoption more than LN is likely to do over any time frame. However just because of how open and decentralized the blockchain is I don’t think Bakkt can charge high rates without sacrificing market share to competition.

Volume is a better measure, and Coinbase probably has the highest US volume 
@_date: 2018-05-06 02:37:41
Bitcoin cash occasionally sees extreme run ups in price and volume as (what I think are) manipulators save and buy very suddenly to maximize price effect, hoping it keeps valuations elevated on a sustained basis. 
However you can see typically it just drifts down without this tactic. Volume was a mere $300M a few weeks ago. 
I doubt BCH will ever be a real contender. Keep in mind bitcoin followers very strongly opposed the big blocks as a scaling solution and it was very clear what the majority wanted and put their money to. I think it’s near impossible for the tides to change after seeing this. 
@_date: 2018-05-10 03:25:42

@_date: 2017-02-22 04:01:19
I wouldn't hold that as a top fear. Banks and wealthy people really don't "team up to keep us down," everyone is competing by themselves out there.

Good point but I'd still say it's uncertain and can play out either favorably or unfavorably to bitcoin. I personally think adoption by vendors will spread faster if Bitcoin is the only major cryptocurrency game in town. You're saying adoption by consumers would more than compensate for this. Who knows...
Yeah I agree. Hoping this all gets sorted out! Looks like it's going to be contentious.

Dude, this is not how trends work lol. You can't just take any day in history and line them together.
@_date: 2017-02-19 20:21:24
thank you thats useful. So at the moment it's just being signaled but not implemented? Any good ways you like to track this?
@_date: 2017-02-21 16:58:47
Correct me if I'm wrong, but during a fork isn't the best thing to do just not trade until it's clear which update won?
Also side question - how do you select which version of bitcoin you choose?
@_date: 2017-02-24 21:08:45
Can't prove it
@_date: 2017-02-25 23:02:48
Yeah but it still brings competition to Bitcoin's cost advantage for processing. We want vendors to accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-26 21:05:57
I know you come from a history of political upset, but I think you assumption the demise of the western world is greatly overestimated. What happens if the world continues on for another 10-20 years? You will have missed an opportunity for meaningful investment. 
If you have bitcoin, don't invest much more in precious metals. Invest in good long term businesses too.

What do you base "too much" on? Bitcoin is intrinsically worth multiples of its current price. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 00:55:37
I think it's safe to assume the majority is for storing wealth, since the activity is closely tied to news on the weakening yuan. 
@_date: 2017-02-20 22:29:36
That would cause the bitcoin price to increase like 10x for Nigeria, which would be awesome, but yet it would be unusual for a barely developed country to adopt bitcoin over, say, the USD
@_date: 2017-02-24 15:52:57
THANK YOU. This whole sub is filled with chart readers. They have NO base of rationale. Newbs. 
I just read that bitcoin is "overheated" and the real price is "$750." Bitcoin is not a mature asset yet, it will be in the hundreds of billions if not trillions of dollars. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 21:47:01
Pretty sound logic IMO as we sometimes forget how irrational our public budgeting really is. I don't think the government will fall apart, but whatever they do I'm sure safe haven assets will pay off. 
@_date: 2017-02-14 14:03:26
And that's assuming it's just a safe haven asset and not used as a currency. An adoption as a form of payment would blow it up.

I would also expect it to replace gold because because it is more accessible, easy to transfer, cheaper to store, with the bonus of being able to buy goods with it. So I think it should exceed the $8T mark.

@_date: 2017-02-22 04:12:12
I think you misinterpreted me because I definitely did not suggest wealthy people are less informed. I spent a paragraph listing all their advantages.
The reasons the average joe in this case has the edge is because: they aren't restricted to trying new asset classes and the low liquidity of bitcoin is better able to serve small investors. Bitcoin also has no barriers to entry, unlike say, property which could require millions in capital to enter.
@_date: 2017-02-25 01:04:42
March 11 is the final deadline for the ETF. Bitcoin is rising because of favorable anticipation, similar to how the stock market rises leading up to hopeful earnings announcements. 
Idk about may 26 I can't find anything on that date.

@_date: 2017-02-24 00:33:42
The Chinese love a good gamble. Their stock markets show more herding trends, and I read the average education of investors is like not even high school. They will push bitcoin higher if they like the trend.

@_date: 2017-02-25 00:45:57
Yea, it's getting there. I mean, at least we have legitimate exchanges now like Gemini. The types of wallets also got a lot better too.

It makes no sense to me to compare apple to bitcoin, they don't share anything in common. Bitcoin is not a company it's a currency. As such, it has the potential to go much higher. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 00:30:58
It's not quite right to compare bitcoin to a stock. A stock is an income generating asset with a completely different risk profile and investor base. Bitcoin should be compared to gold and cash...which are in the trillions.

Like buying a gold ETF, you don't have to worry about storage or security. Also if you're a big money manager you probably have guidelines that make this the only way to buy it.

lol I think you mean what's your cost of lifestyle. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 18:02:10
The long term growth prospects are very, very favorable. Bitcoin is becoming an asset class, and is competing against existing assets values in the trillions of dollars. It's $17B now and is seeing accelerating adoption trends. 
I am putting about 30% of my net worth into bitcoin because I think growth is a certainty, but the degree of which depends over time how it develops 
@_date: 2017-02-25 01:35:00
I'm certain it will. Once enough volume supports the price, vendors have an incentive to use bitcoin because it cuts out the 3% credit card processing fees. We just got to be hopeful governments don't create their own blockchain on fiat too soon (ex: China)...
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:56:46
Old fat Italian lady unfortunately.

The Chinese woke up and rushed to buy bitcoin in Japanese exchanges is my guess. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 22:38:43
I'd imagine other countries like China and Russia want to replace the world reserve currency. Bitcoin is a better bet than a "basket of currencies" idea. Could happen slowly over time. Bitcoin has a long way to go on gaining acceptance though. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 03:16:58
So, you can buy and sell bitcoin on Gemini...but I noticed you cant send it to anyone.
@_date: 2017-02-20 04:20:50
I believe even their regular wallets have 98% in cold storage. The vault just add more identification factors like 2 emails and 48 hours to cancel.

I felt much more at ease with BU the less I relied on Reddit and the more I read primary sources: BU and BC websites, Jihan Wu posts and professional history, Roger Ver interviews, etc. We all want bitcoin to be a balanced and successful cryptocurrency. No major player is "evil" as far as my research has shown me. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:12:14

Sorry, just because of the rampant misinformation going on all the time, do you have a source to back this?
@_date: 2017-03-08 19:30:54
What's the problem? It's only regulated so far as tax accounting. The government doesn't have control over bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 05:54:20
This same question floods Reddit everyday. Do a search. 
@_date: 2017-03-30 21:20:14
You didn't expect a financial asset to go on with zero regulation, did you? This is a small step up and is vastly more preferable than a draconian slash. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 21:17:42
That's a really good way of looking at and I agree. To be honest I never really felt it had a majority chance of failure because there are a lot crazier ETFs out there and Bitcoin has come a long way.
I posted this awhile ago on why I think it would be approved:
* Because the Winklevoss hired a star-lawyer Kathleen Moriarty who is known for getting innovative ETFs to market. 
* Because the Winklevoss personally set up an exchange with the purpose of providing liquidity and security (i.e. Gemini), and abides by the most extensive of financial regulation of NY
* Because one of the two SEC officers says in her official bio that she supports streamlining financial backoffice processes (pretty much screams out she's a blockchain fan): "She is also a strong advocate for...the shortening of the settlement cycle for equities and fixed income; enhanced clearing agency standards" 
* Because bitcoin is becoming bigger and having an increasing presence within financial markets, and it's only appropriate bitcoin become seriously reviewed.
* Because the Winklevoss have made many amendments to their proposal, indicating the SEC is keeping an open mind and having constructive dialogue.
* Because members of the new Trump admin publicly praise bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-05 16:38:36
And everyone knows we don't have a shortage of countries near a fiscal or financial crisis. 
@_date: 2017-02-25 08:27:26
Awh, why thank you. I'll keep that wisdom in mind.
@_date: 2017-03-12 15:42:50
I think the logic should be that as rates rise, the dollar strengthens, and the rest of the world gets nervous and invests in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 08:11:02
These are just random facts about bitcoin and doesn't tell the whole story. I can guarantee you the SEC does not think this way. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 19:15:52
I don't think so because the concept is just, frankly, wrong. Gold prices by the "ounce" doesnt have any connection to "one bitcoin." Anyone who is analyzing bitcoin seriously is looking at other factors, so I wouldn't give it any more weight than a novelty fact.  
@_date: 2017-03-30 23:33:30
These articles are way better than the shitposts about BU vs BC

@_date: 2017-03-02 17:21:39
I think so. As someone working in financial analysis something like this wouldn't even considered. It just doesn't make sense, and even from a psychological standpoint there's just no evidence. This is just Reddit/zerohedge logic. 
@_date: 2017-02-24 18:22:27
You would think Tyler Durden would be all for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-21 04:06:45
I feel like defending BU a bit here: I don't think the miners can do anything too aggressive without breaking public trust. I'm certain they understand this given the still-early days of bitcoin and the potential for billions of dollars that could quickly evaporate (such as over this weekend). Wu has a background in private equity which leads me to believe he has, at the very LEAST, a firm understanding of business and market fundamentals and the concept of how important trust is for a currency. Furthermore, he shows to have a big personal passion for it since he left that industry to start a bitcoin news site, invent and sell cutting-edge mining hardware to the PUBLIC, and establish a public mining pool. Someone who just "sees dollar signs" wouldn't be able to do something like this - this sort of thing comes from a visionary. Regardless though and perhaps most importantly: cryptocurrencies are competitive with low switching costs. If they ruin it people leave and they lose everything.
So, if we make it a given they won't outright destroy bitcoin, they still can't grossly raise miner fees before incentivizing more miners to join. This can easily happen too, especially from existing players such as Bitfury if BC were to become obsolete and BU was more profitable.
TL:DR both SW and BU are fine ideas. Large imbalances will be fixed by economics. Cryptocurrencies are very competitive and I'm sure all players are aware of how easy they can lose everything. People don't "need" bitcoin, and so they cannot force people to stick around if it sucks.

Reading is the most important thing to do (news like Bloomberg, WSJ, Business Insider, CNBC; and books..I highly recommend "The Most Important Thing"), getting your hands dirty with experience, and keeping a journal of your expectations to review later on. Do this even if you aren't betting money, because you want to learn as many different types of lessons as possible. Try to think about what factors REALLY matter in a situation. Avoid listening to unsophisticated opinions. 
When I mentioned credit cards I only meant to point out the fact that Bitcoin's transaction fees are less than credit card fees. I mean to show the incentive for vendors to prefer to be paid in bitcoin.
For valuing bitcoin, you want to monitor it's progress to fulfill certain uses. Specifically: store of value and medium of exchange. These are multi-trillion dollar opportunities and can lead bitcoin prices to be $100,000's per bitcoin. You can track this by observing volume on exchanges (ex: bitcoinwisdom.com), looking at Google Trends  to see people's interest across the world, and any news of big institutions accommodating bitcoin (ex: Japanese banks, COIN ETF, Kremlin changing their opinion on bitcoin).
If you want specifics on how to quantify the value of bitcoin I recommend my recent blogpost or this article I liked:
* ajmoliterno.blogspot.com
* 
For "handling bitcoin," excuse me if I answer this inaccurately, but you want to buy and hold. You're betting on a new technology that already shows good trends of adoption.
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:53:20
DOA. The SEC essentially wants a global network of sophisticated exchanges that all track IDs and flows and share between each other. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 19:57:22
Also keep in mind that while users betting AGAINST this outcome only have the option to bet in this market, meanwhile users who bet for it to PASS can invest this way OR outright buy bitcoin. My point is that people expecting it to pass probably just bought bitcoin.

Depends on your timeframe, I personally have 10-30 years, so yes definitely. Focusing on a price of "$1300 vs $900" is a waste of time considering the market cap is only $20 billion and is growing in competition to trillion-dollar assets like gold and fiat. I'm a financial analyst by profession and I have a $5-10 trillion market cap target which translates into $300k-750k per bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-03-13 01:47:33
I personally don't think bitcoin investors are weighing "should i invest in bitcoin or treasuries", so I don't think dollars will leave bitcoin as interest rates rise. I think it WILL prompt foreign investors to buy bitcoin to preserve wealth. So I think rising interest rates are good for bitcoin in the short term.

I can agree with that (except Andreas, I don't respect him). However it IS better that bitcoin grow as fast and as big as possible to solidify itself (much like fb in regards to social networking). I do think bitcoin will get there, but as we both seem to understand, this SEC decision was obviously a setback. I'm particularly worried of altcoins, and hope Dashcoin growth decelerates or declines.

We're used to living in our own bubble in the US but many people invest in bitcoin for reasons unrelated to the ETF..Bitcoin is getting bigger I don't see it declining as sharply as it used it.
I'm also of the minority opinion that the ETF is expected to pass. The Winklevii have been making all the right moves to settle concerns.

That doesn't sound right, because then it makes no sense why the blocks would be reduced if all the information remains on-chain. Hence "segregated" witness. I believe the signature is off-chain and is only tracked by the updated nodes, while only the essential information is processed on-chain.

Because of congestion, and it's congested right now. I think we can totally use bitcoin for daily transactions and Segwit can help with that, and I'm sure we'll eventually grow into that, but BU is "good enough" if it passes and doesn't have a chance of collapsing miner fees in the short term.

This is a great and simple way to analyze bitcoin and confirms my target market cap of about $1-10T ($60-$600 BTC)
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:22:20
Well, if it helps, I'm a financial analyst by profession and I personally agree with the whole article and think the $2-3.5k range is very reasonable. Hard to quantify of course, but I base it on the very small market cap of $20B, plus good trends in volume, positive regulatory developments in Japan, and the probability of some scare related to geopolitics or equity valuations. Swing developments could be the ETF, China and perhaps a disagreement in the US budget. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 14:39:26
Hard to say because of all the misinformation. But looking at its basic concept it seems ok. The network decides on a MB size together. Since miners can ALREADY set soft limits amongst each other it leads me to believe we'll be ok.

Actually I respect both protocols. I just lean toward SW in this specific race because BU has too many bugs, and we can arguably put off BU if SW "gets the job done" for now. But either way I'd be glad to have some kind of progress be made since we're hitting the 1MB ceiling now. 
Lol yeah, I have my own opinions but I have to rely on people with more technical knowledge to explain or give an opinion on the coding. I am a financial analyst by profession, not a programmer.

For absolute consent but a "good-enough" threshold would only be the US-EU and maybe China before it becomes relatively near-worthless. Bitcoin is not worth much when the only way to buy it is with physical cash because the banks prohibit transferring to exchanges.
It's important now to just note the sentiment of these regulators. The EU seems to mention how it's "...a balanced approach...protect innovation," so hopefully that narrative continues.

No way, so if I had an account with any other currency like GBP and used it to buy something, I would need to keep track of how the current exchange translates to dollars and record it for tax season?

I am not an expert but give you an example, I'm downloading a node program right now and I have 50% more to download until it's complete...and that 50% is just data from 2016. The demand on our computers is going to take a heavier toll as time goes on so it's imperative we adopt a solution that slims down the workload on computers if we want bitcoin to get to the point where it can be practically scaled "to buy a cup of coffee." If we settle for just raising the block size then power will become more centralized as industrial-sized player are the only ones to provide capacity and eventually be left to vote. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 01:24:35

* I don't care about which protocol of bitcoin wins. It's not good vs. evil but different perspectives. I argue with the BTC sub as much as here (lol) so from what I gather is that BU is adequate enough if it does get passed. But I agree that if we want to move to bitcoin-as-a-credit-card level of volume we will probably need to hardfork AGAIN if BU is released.
* The forces of capitalism are very complex and ought to be respected as such. We have no "control sample" so I wouldn't see what the price does as proof that either me or you were wrong or right on any one idea.
* I disagree, bitcoin doesn't run on idealism, it runs on a balanced architecture. Math seems like a holy grail but we must also respect the USD and Fed, because frankly the world can't run on gold-standard. We need flexibility to combat the business cycle, which is natural in capitalism. There is no absolute-righteous authority. Bitcoin serves a valuable purpose which I believe in, but it is not "the" solution. If we had bitcoin instead of dollars capitalism would have been ruined during the great recession. I would argue the fed is actually one of the best-run government institutions we have!
* I'm not a conspiracy theorist.

Segwit only solves malleability for future innovations like lightning network. It does not increase the block size to reduce congestion by itself. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 05:09:35
Hah I remember you. So basically I'm a big proponent of buy and hold, and whenever possible I try to challenge people who think in the trader (short-term) mindset. Fighting your emotions is one of the top challenges in investing, based on personal experience, interviews of professionals, and books I've read (i.e. The Most Important Thing, Security Analysis). For instance I had a debate with someone yesterday who wouldn't change his mind because he "felt something was in the air" and gave random price targets. I failed to change his mind but I nevertheless feel obligated to try to help people think correctly.
For example, the BC &amp; BU is a big deal...but I would argue articles like this hold even heavier weight as well, and this wasn't even on our front page:

Bitcoin can't be a bubble really, because it's value lies in how many people use it, which is growing. The only way I can see it being a bubble is if there's super leveraged buying as the price is exploding higher. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:56:36
Both Ver and Wu like the idea of lightning network as a long term solution, but they want to avoid a scenario of a collapse in miner fees. 
The bitcoin power players have more in common than the Reddit sub communities want to admit. We all want bitcoin to be robust and growing. If bitcoin were to be unfairly imbalanced in ANY way then people will leave for another crypto and then we all lose. Let's all make the effort to be open minded.

Ok that's interesting, so all-in-all the size of the data seems to still be the same, just more efficient in what is really needed to be processed through a miner and keeps the signature data strictly among nodes.
That's a pretty cool idea. I wonder roughly what proportion this witness data is of a total block...like if the bare-bones block is 70% of the full-block's size, would miners see their volume (and income) reduced 30%?
Also I'm hearing SW allows only up to 4mb. This doesn't seem that flexible over the long term, am I missing something?

You're right! Public investors are now able to invest. I guess they technically could have before but there are a ton of suitability regulations that probably prevent them investing in something not on an exchange. 
I mean even still institutional investors probably will be hesitant including bitcoins but as their peers talk about it among each other and it continues making headlines and investors ask about it in sure they'll come around. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 21:51:17
Oh definitely. It does sound crazy but the math does work out that way. Bitcoin isn't to be compared to a company but other ASSET classes, and if it continues going global those price targets are very reasonable. I've invested a third of net worth into bitcoin, and I'm worth in the low six figures.

I feel like you've taken every assumption to the extreme, let me balance some of these points out:
* Bitcoin poses no new threat than gold does, which is a market &gt;400x bigger than bitcoin
* You assume the SEC even considers the "health of fiat" in their analysis (they only consider protecting investors)
* You assume bitcoin itself could cause material changes in interest rates (hard to do, bond market is like $200T) because money flows out of bonds to bitcoin (investors don't freely jump between dissimilar asset types that easily due to investment objectives)
* You assume the government is having issues affording interest payments (it is not, they are highly rated)
* You assume the fed will print money for "helicopter" uses (US doesn't do that) which will cause hyperinflation (unlikely) instead of just adjusting the federal funds rate (as they have been doing)

Nice username. Thanks for the constructive input. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 18:37:56
Let's not demonize each other and make the effort to respect each other. Miners are afraid transactions conducted off chain will reduce their revenue. That's completely reasonable. BU will still reduce fees and relieve congestion. 
Off-chain like LN can eventually happen in the future when it is apparent bitcoin is being used more for micro transactions and we require that functionality. Just have patience. From what I've read miners respect the idea of SW but are taking a more gradual approach. If it gets to the point where bitcoin is unusable they can lose everything...they know this. 
I think it's more important we make the effort to reconcile and not ruin bitcoin, because It's still possible bitcoin can be displaced by another cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 16:33:50
It sounds crazy but I have no doubt it will reach $10k because a $200B market cap is still peanuts for an asset, relatively speaking.

Well GDP is income but assets are higher, like muuuuch higher. The global bond market is $200T for example. All gold is like $8T...but thats almost half the whole US GDP, but it's still reasonable to see a portion of it into bitcoin over the long term, if not most.

Your kind: people that feel bitcoin is the ultimate middle-finger to the government. Some people on this sub are outright crazy. The government doesn't "confiscate" property, nor have we EVER had out of control printing and hyperinflation.
My kind: Winklevoss/Thiel/etc. People that see an efficient way to revolutionize the global economy and an opportunity to multiply investment.
Why does anyone park their money anywhere except to maximize wealth? Sorry, but that's how the world works and is why bitcoin is rising in value - Not because of some anarchist/libertarian wave. Hence the popularity abroad. People who think otherwise are newbs at life.
In short, I can't wait until bitcoin matures and more financially sophisticated people dominate the discussions. Until then it's pretty teeth grinding to hack through the stupidity.

This is not good. They say it "cannot be anonymous" and also say their rules don't condone the currency either...worst of both worlds. The next news on this won't be until June, but this issue is definitely gonna be more important than BU vs. BC.
My guess is some wide agreement is made to identify and track cryptocurrencies...and the only way to do that is to impose sweeping rules on all actors. Whether or not it can succeed is uncertain, because it would certainly require very heavy international agreement and coordination, and in an iron-first fashion as well. Idk, would they try to force all nodes/miners/exchanges/wallets to update with identity tracking software? They're starting to "define" these different actors which is telling. If they force any mandate on a sweeping basis bitcoin would lose a lot of trust as being immune from capital controls and privacy...or, hopefully, it moves in a more cautious step and improves toward legitimacy.

Sorry dude, not going to disclose personal info to thirsty trolls. Hope my advice was useful. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 16:23:01
I'm pretty sure SW doesn't have a literal block size increase, but it effectively is one, so to speak, because it's taking the signature information off-chain...but the core transaction details remain on chain (ex: how much bitcoin, where to, where from). That's why sometimes you see people say it increases block sizes to "1.8" or "2.1" because it's an estimate. Eventually though volume on bitcoin will increase such that the 1MB will need to be increased. 
This is just what I've been told be more savvy people that seem trustworthy. Also it doesn't include the idea of lightning network.

Yep! I can see the price getting close to $2k soon if passed, probably $3-4k or more end of year. But the real value of this ETF will be gradual, as investors are cognizant it's available on the exchange, and as they and their peers feel more familiar with it.
A good example is myself buying into it for the first time this year. I was like "oh this thing is still around?...it's doing great?...I guess the blockchain technology really is solid?...the growth prospects are still astronomical?" I imagine other investors will go through those same phases.

I think what the argument may be here is that they should be taking the growth of bitcoin more serious from a long term perspective. Those miners in china have a significant cost advantage and are firmly profitable, they should be nervous at press saying that processing fees are skyrocketing.

@_date: 2017-03-08 04:44:22

No no no...prices run up all the time on hope of a positive announcement. Also quantitatively, "pricing in" can be expressed as the average between the chance of success times the price of success, plus the chance of failure times the price of failure.

This sounds wrong to me. If it increased the on-chain size then that would require a hard fork, pretty sure. SW is an effective size increase but not explicitly. 
Also why would SW be limited to 1MB? Doesn't make technical sense to me. 
The 4MB is an estimate but I was told it practically won't be much greater than 2.1MB.

From what I understand is that SW effectively acts as a bigger block increase because it takes some information off-chain, but there is a certain amount of bare minimum information that will always need to be on-chain. So eventually we'll need to address a block increase to accommodate this.

If all information were to remain on-chain then that wouldn't solve the congestion issue. If you think I'm wrong please explain how you think SW solves congestion then. 
It's not on chain. It's a segregated, a SECOND layer solution which the new nodes will track.  The advantage being it does not need to be processed through the miners and relieves congestion. That's what makes it so neat:)

Lol good question! They are definitely raising eyebrows to the "legendary" returns of bitcoin, and a few even know quite a bit about the basics...like how it works, the ETF deadline, maybe the success it's had as a store of value across the world. However many still don't seem to care to understand the risk profile of bitcoin and hence realize that the recent growth is LEGIT compared to the Mt. Gox summit. Many also don't realize it's competing with asset classes worth trillions of dollars, and because of its multiple uses and superior qualities, that we should expect big things from it.
Investors don't really have important psychological barriers, with price levels anyway. I bet you the moment their colleagues talk about bitcoin in earnest and when vendors/banks accomodate bitcoin is when you'll see a huge rush to buy it.

It could be argued it's too early for off-chain solutions. If we implement it and the majority of volume is done off-chain, then it runs the risk of running miners out of business, which would grind bitcoin to a halt. BU is a compromise in the meantime.

I respectfully disagree. The $1T is its "right value" and the other two variables reference the current valuation in order to reveal a multiple. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 14:00:09
So going to it's most basic concept is that people need to have a well-developed opinion on valuation. Many small investors just don't have the skillset or drive to do an appropriate analysis. The truth is investing is very much like being a doctor or lawyer, you need a technical understanding of a very tough subject.
Big investors get angry if their portfolio lags the market one or two years, because they didn't learn the full risk/reward they're betting on. Some managers like hedge funds are secretive so may they aren't even able to learn. The truth is with this point is that everyone needs financial literacy and to be able to have an opinion, otherwise you'll never know the quality of advice you're getting.
Bitcoin I compare to M2 measures of fiat currency (with complimentary processor network) and gold, except it's new and innovative. Most of the qualities you're familiar with: bitcoin is finite, transferable, private, etc...however I don't think people appreciate that compared to credit cards, which charge vendors 3-4.5%, will VERY much want to adopt bitcoin eventually. I think US consumers will be one of the last adopters since we're spoiled with the stability of the US dollar and very consumer-friendly credit cards being offered.

@_date: 2017-03-01 20:57:32
I am most optimistic that it will at least be successful as a store of value, based on its finite supply and accessibility. I am also optimistic, albeit to a lesser extent, that it will be used as a currency as the popularity of it as a store of value grows, and as vendors look to decrease transaction costs. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 21:34:18

I actually expect it to pass (i.e. 70%):
* Because the Winklevoss hired a star-lawyer Kathleen Moriarty who is known for getting innovative ETFs to market. She's THE best pick.
* Because the Winklevoss personally set up an exchange with the purpose of providing liquidity and security (i.e. Gemini), and abides by the most extensive of financial regulation of NY
* Because one of the two SEC officers says in her official bio that she supports streamlining financial backoffice processes (pretty much screams out she's a blockchain fan): "She is also a strong advocate for...the shortening of the settlement cycle for equities and fixed income; enhanced clearing agency standards"  
* Because bitcoin is becoming bigger and having an increasing presence within financial markets, and it's only appropriate bitcoin become seriously reviewed.
* Because the Winklevoss have made many amendments to their proposal, indicating the SEC is keeping an open mind
* Because members of the new Trump admin publicly praise bitcoin

The etfs will only be $100m or less, a small basket compared to bitcoins $18B market cap. Honestly what really adds value is just having a good exchange like Gemini and existing banks integrating a BTC balance into their pages (i.e. USAA). The rest is word of mouth, news, and a good track record.

This is really all we can say about the situation right now. I completely agree. 
It's interesting how the hash for BU has been going down to ~34% from 40% a few days ago. It's probably peaked. Plus with the nodes and exchanges still sticking by core I'd guess the chance of a successful HF is about 15%. Jihan Wu is going to have to change his strategy lest the price stays weak and bitcoin loses ground competitively. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 02:30:36
I agree. If you want to get technical about it, bubbles can form if people are buying bitcoin on, say, debt. But otherwise I'd say that the value is derived from the network, and so the bigger the better.

This is very, very misleading. First of all we don't want a central bank to be under congressional control, because they already prove themselves consistently unable to balance a budget. Imagine if printing money and interest rates became politicized?
The central bank is a half-public-half-private institution and is arguably the most effective institution the US has. We successfully avoided another Great Depression all while never having hyperinflation. By nearly all measures we're recovering. 
The fed does not print to pay off debt, but to fulfill its objectives to balance employment and interest rates. When they print, like with quantitative easing, they merely swapped the new money in exchange for toxic assets, so the total value released into the economy was  essentially neutral. The only thing that inflated was the Feds balance sheet, which is "hidden" from the economy. 
In my opinion it is time for the fed to scale back and allow interest rates to rise, but overall they've done a fine job. If you're mad at government just blame congress.

I completely disagree. Institutional investors abide by fiduciary mandates that restrict their investment options to SEC-compliant exchange-traded products, i.e. ETF. This untapped potential represents more money than bitcoin is worth MANY times over. There are also many Americans skeptical of bitcoin because it's so unusual to invest in, not to mention a shoddy exchange lost hundreds of millions of value. 
Bitcoin needs to grow up. It's more than just a political statement.

I only checked out multibit and armory. 
Armory is safer but you'll want to have a computer that will be permanently offline. It requires a few extra steps going between computers to send a payment, but nothing too bad. You are able to view your balance using a "viewing only" wallet on your internet-connected computer. 
Multibit is easier but requires you to have java (someone please correct me if I'm wrong), which has been known to occasionally have holes and so if you keep your computer online you'll want to keep it up to date. I presume having it on an offline computer is safe, but you'll need to connect it eventually if you want to check your balance, meanwhile armory doesn't have this problem.

Precious metals will never replace fiat because it's too difficult to transact with and it's not easily divisible for regular micro transactions. Bitcoin is interesting because it is better in these ways. 
However outside of bitcoin, stocks are astronomically better than precious metals because they absorb inflation too over the long term. People who stock up on metals for the long term are gravely mistaken.

Economic developments don't happen by the minute. Zoom out and you'll see the economic developments. 
Technical analysis is for the birds. That's why everyone says HODL. It's otherwise just random price movements people think they can use to predict future movements. 
Like when I buy bitcoins it doesn't matter if it's $1300 or $1200, I buy it because I want bitcoin. A traders perspective is narrow. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 05:35:44
Yeah I remember you from when this dude was hot on my ass for disclosing I was a CFA. Anyway, yeah, and even well respected hedge fund investors like Kyle Bass admit EVERYONE gets burned this way, even his grade of talent
Interview I'm referencing:
Thinking long term is very difficult because things can change so fast and you have to convince yourself often with little solid information, but regardless, that's the correct and only way to think about it.
So for me, I think the fairly positive regulatory responses (i.e. US, Russia, China, EU), the bitcoin adoption trends, and the growing sophistication/formalization of exchanges are all VERY good for the long term. However to hedge some uncertainty I'm also betting 15% of my cryptocurrency investments into Ethereum as well...because the idea of an "open source blockchain" seems to be the answer to what enterprises are looking for when they talk about engaging blockchain technology.
@_date: 2017-03-04 01:17:31
Yeah I've seen both links before. I like some of the variables considered but to be honest I don't find the model/his formula convincing from a quantitative  standpoint.
Video: so his formula only considers volume, velocity and supply. It doesn't consider things like the global asset base of store-of-value assets like gold...which is arguably bitcoin's greatest competitive advantage and hence the most important variable. Furthermore all his variables, except for supply, are impossible to ballpark.
Model: it's unattractive to me when models try to quantify things that aren't quantifiable like "risk of 51% attack." Even if you had the godly ability to oversee multiple universes and be technically "accurate", it wouldn't provide you any gains unless the perception of the masses agreed with you. In other words, you're not right unless everyone else agrees with you because that's who's ultimately bidding your bitcoin. Additionally, one can argue people don't consider these variables at all when thinking about bitcoin.
In situations where it's difficult to model something, you by rule of thumb do NOT want to include more assumptions over less. Keep it simple. Which leads me to my opinion that the only way to estimate bitcoin's price potential is compare it to M2 money supply and Gold, which are in the trillions of dollars. The math works out that Bitcoin would be worth about $62,000 for EVERY trillion dollars it can grow. I can't tell you how many trillions it can reach, but obviously the reward is nothing short of astronomical.
@_date: 2017-03-02 20:39:52

Taxation is confiscation? Jeez man reaching for the short hairs here lol.
In terms of your opinion, whatever floats your boat. But the big whales, the exchange owners (that don't lose money) and the miners are enterprising businessmen. Thinking like they do is the key to understanding the fundamentals of bitcoin's future prospects.

I respectfully disagree...the average "big" non-china exchange volume is $20-30m, the Chinese major exchanges had over $400m! They were HUGE. The ETFs are only $100m...small potatoes.

No dude that's the whole point, we're not considering what it did in any given day. Empirically it is better to hold, what you did is risky and you SHOULD buy back in now when everyone is in doubt. If it rises above where you sold it then that's not a "right" move. Understand? You sold because it was going down and you lost confidence. That's easy, it's harder to hold.

Regarding the issue on the "war on cash" as push for higher bitcoin prices, I have doubts you're going to see many people rushing to buy bitcoin in the developed world because the trust in the institutions is much higher.

Volatility isn't bad per se. Those funds have the objective and disclosure of being that way. The problem with Bitcoin being so volatile is because it's relatively illiquid or "immature" for government-endorsed investing.

My point is miners are rational actors and can't ruin bitcoin without ruining themselves. Bitcoin has low switching costs. Read Wu and watch Ver yourself instead of just reading Reddit.

To everyone reading the above: This is exactly what you're NOT supposed to do - sell because "something is in the air." You're supposed to sell when a solid development fundamentally changes your long term outlook. The whole point of "hodl" is to ride this shit out, because in the end bitcoin is a very promising asset due of its core features and excellent adoption trends.
Whether it's the scaling debate, possible Chinese exchange insolvency, or EU regulation, the long term price prospects are very good. BUY the dips, don't sell them!

It's incrementally more anonymous and works better across borders. When I was buying inventory from small Chinese suppliers they would prefer Western Union, I think because they try to avoid taxes or a paper trail. I would send a transaction that can only be picked up in by someone in person presenting an ID matching the name I entered and a confirmation code. No bank or any record. 
Meanwhile PayPal records and reports everything, freezes transactions if it smells funny to them, and don't always work well across borders. Also you need a bank account as there are no physical locations.

Alright! so:
* Bitcoin won't be centralized, at least by governments. If it were to be centralized it'd be through miner collusion, or some similar anti-market scheme.
* Oversimplification of dollars that is just inaccurate. Also you can argue mediums like bitcoin exacerbate crime because of its anonymity. Sorry but it's true (and evident!)
* When you invest you hope to GAIN value, not just maintain it. We don't live in a hyperinflationary environment. Let's not make that assumption.
* The greed label is a bit harsh but yes I am an investor, so I look at it in that perspective. However you should be welcoming people like me, because I personally invested $50k, and others like me can and will invest much more. Not on idealism though, but on profit. You should welcome us because we further your cause and, frankly, we carry more weight.
* I'm 28, not old. I don't think you're/we're a new generation so much as young and naive, and will EVENTUALLY accumulate enough world experience to conform to older generations. Teachers for example say kids never change. Same as us and our ideals. The world is a rough place and idealism is for teenagers/young-twenties. That's why they join the army!
@_date: 2017-03-06 00:07:48
It's hard to prove but tuition say yes it'll increase volatility, but there are other arguments that it helps with price discovery. Depends on the intentions of the market players.
Yes in order to short there first must exist an equal amount of shares already bought.
When you short you actually "duplicate" the security because you're "borrowing" the shares to sell now with the intention of buying back later. So it'll increase supply of bitcoin to investors, however if the price keeps going up the shorts will have to buy back at a loss and can exacerbate upward price movements.
@_date: 2017-03-12 15:34:46
A breakout isn't dependent on price levels but on economic developments. Namely, you want institutional investors getting in and scares in foreign capital markets.

Don’t keep your money on exchanges. They’re unregulated and run fractional reserves, and now apparently speculate with it to make quick gains if business is tight. 
Not only is it safer for users to hold their own coin, but it supports the price by denying exchanges selling bitcoin it doesn’t actually have. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 14:15:46
Honestly we're benefitting from high asset values in technology spilling over into cryptos. Cryptos are still perceived as very risky. If the markets tank right now bitcoin would not skyrocket. 
Once bitcoin matures a bit more it may exhibit more safe haven trends. When? You'd need material institutional investment, probably translating to a couple hundred billion in market cap.

FUD. Bakkt explicitly said they're not providing anything like that (at least for now).
Bakkt is important because besides providing an avenue for institutions, it's trying to create a network that retailers and people can connect to and enjoy high transactions speeds without necessarily using the blockchain. This is good for scaling. And of course if you don't like that, you can always choose to keep most/all your value purely by the blockchain.

So we don't lose &gt;90% of our hashrate, grinding bitcoin to a halt a rendering it unsafe?

Bitcoin is positioned perfectly for the current macroeconomic landscape. For the type of recession that China is set to have (debt defaults, overstimulus) and currency crises in third world countries (Venezuela, other S. America countries, Turkey, South Africa, etc), Bitcoin represents a very attractive hide away and technology investment. 
If the US has higher pressures with its high deficits and debt against rising rates, Bitcoin could explode far higher than we expect - there’s literally no telling under a buying frenzy. $1m..$10m per bitcoin could be extreme possibilities to me.

Depends on the institution. I imagine the mega institutions need qualified custody such as Bakkt while smaller institutions may have more flexibility and engage in OTC markets.

@_date: 2017-08-15 12:48:09
Exactly. More sophisticated investors enter and they aren't as trigger twitchy. 
I don't know what Goldman is talking about saying that they expect these huge volatility waves. Idk maybe I'm wrong. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:37:08
Oh I have an idea. So how's troll life going?

@_date: 2017-08-08 04:51:16
Bitcoin has been low with volatility for over a month. Let's enjoy this bull run. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 14:23:12
I agree. In a high-growth space it's better to invest sooner than later. That's why I didn't pursue a "dollar cost averaging" strategy so often espoused on here.

I just want a currency that a super majority of users agree with. Segwit2x was a fair deal and I support it. I am not willing to risk tearing bitcoin in two over a measly +1mb.

Volatility should be measured in percentage not dollars. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:45:54
Why? Bitcoin has properties to make it an attractive safe haven. It's probably more like gold than a currency, at least right now. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 18:17:57

@_date: 2019-03-19 19:13:33
Also: if you look at coin market cap the heavy volume isn’t even on the Chinese exchanges mentioned in the article, it’s happening on a lot of Singapore based exchanges (ex: coinbene)

Yeah all those people complaining about the bull run have their chance now
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:38:46
I have a feeling $4k triggers a lot of sells and we stay around this area for a few weeks. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:55:26
Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but don't you need a password to access such found funds?
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:58:12
Going mainstream begets maturity in itself. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:42:07
Yeah they have huge buy or sell walls to influence traders' thinking. But if the spot price approaches the walls then the person revises the order to inch it away. 
However that being said a person can only create a wall, not make the appearance of low liquidity. As bitcoin approached $4k there were very few people willing to sell. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:12:10
They're cutting themselves off. We had to compromise for a reason. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 17:59:58
Bitcoin is not owned by poor people
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:34:29
I don't think s2X is as contentious as many people would like us to believe. 
However I am worried about US regulation. There was a single report by the Daily Caller the other week saying anonymous members of congress were considering issuing a brand new cryptocurrency that complied with AML. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:20:07
It's not that they're retarded it's just that they are new to following it. It'll improve. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 14:15:44
I'll first ask for committments, then I'll buy it, and will send it to everyone after receiving payment  
@_date: 2017-08-18 03:10:17
I came by the same guess, that's interesting. It's also interesting that it probably will always grow too, as some poor soul or nitwit loses access.
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:45:33
My guess is early half next year. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:06:45
It was a compromise. Both parties got something they wanted. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 19:08:52
Yeah I thought this too. Give it a few weeks so everyone who wants to sell has sold, then after it reaches equilibrium at a low price let the buying begin. 
I would speculate that the big blockers would like to push this to at least $1000 to grab attention. 
It might not even be hard to execute. I think the supply of BCH is a lot tighter than people think. Maybe half of bitcoin owners didn't take the steps to secure their new coin, and are now lost forever. 
Separately, as we reach the segwit2x hard fork, if there's uncertainty then BCH will do well. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 15:09:50
"Ugh I *really* want to ban it. Can we just ban it?"
"No sir, it's impractical"

@_date: 2017-08-15 01:51:16
That statement only makes sense if you have zero understanding in what you're investing in.

@_date: 2017-08-08 21:40:13
Yeah an upgrade would have never happened otherwise. We'd probably end up with a deeply divisive coinsplit. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 19:08:50
I don't see a US-made bitcoin leading world adoption personally. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 18:42:05
Read the article
@_date: 2017-08-01 02:56:06
Just because you have access doesn't legally give you ownership. You'd get in trouble if caught. This is why we have laws. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:35:13
Throw a conservative assumption out there, and let others guess more aggressively. It probably gets more people excited that way. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 01:00:22
Oh I wasn’t aware of that - interesting! And thanks for the compliment. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:51:34
Bitcoin is supposed to be safe and reliable, not as much quick and efficient. Fragmenting nodes is less so. 
This update is just to be spiteful to what otherwise has been our first "great compromise" in years: segwit2x. Developers should contribute to what the community decided, not attack each other, for the good of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 16:38:45
That's true. I think it also makes sense for mature asset classes that undergo unpredictable business cycles. Bitcoin isn't mature and is exhibiting a network effect, so I think it's better to invest sooner than later. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 19:47:17
Worst of both or best of both?
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:19:06
Yeah, like we're on the verge of getting high front end improvements, or our equivalent of Windows 95. Once that happens users will take serious interest. 
I think it'll also be easy to underestimate the long term growth. I can see a lot of people cashing out once bitcoins hits $1 trillion market cap, meanwhile it could continue growing to maybe $20 trillion. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 16:49:06
The fact that it's expanding internationally at a rapid clip and those points are poised to change. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:44:56

Yeah I guess so! What did you learn from your research? Does Roger have a fuck ton of bitcoin or no bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-11 17:07:01
Yeah I always pound on the idea of the *networking effect* and use Facebook as an example. Glad to see he used that. Once something has positive networking effect it can be very hard to reverse (or low risk to invest in). 
@_date: 2018-06-18 06:32:07

Bitcoin competes against asset classes that are in the trillions of dollars. I personally think we can see bitcoin between $350k-$750k easy. If it becomes widely used in world commerce it can go over $1 million for sure.

Read the news not the price charts. Extreme speculation phase is finished, but as a result we’re now seeing billions in investment into services and human capital entering.

* bitcoin is immature yes. But volatility is relative. For countries with currency instability bitcoin is an accessible and attractive alternative. The larger bitcoin grows the less volatile it becomes
* Speculation is welcome as it increases liquidity and spreads use, and thus legitimizes it as an asset that any one person will know others will accept for value
* "Trust" is barriers to entry. That's why bitcoin is taking so long to grow. It is highly unlikely another currency can "steal" widespread trust by offering incremental/negligible improvements. This is why Litecoin will never grow to more than speculation.
* Bitcoin is immature, but growing fast because it is superior to gold
* Gold will likely lose market share to bitcoin because it is expensive to store, trade, transport, split and sell.
@_date: 2017-08-30 04:41:33
Well, not that I am technically inclined to speak, but I believe a lot of the major chip manufacturer's are becoming very interested in this space, and we'll be sure to see very interesting innovation which can hopefully side-step this bullshit and make mining more competitive. Miners basically saved the stock of AMD, and the CEO is all about it now.

Seems like they have a lot to figure out what they can practically hope to achieve. So the question is would the current government sooner crack down on crypto use or allow it?
Honestly it's hard to envision either. The government may not be able to stop it but they can certainly ruin it for the honest users like us. Destroying most of the current market price and taking down exchanges. The black market will continue to survive, probably using currencies like Dash or Monero which has actual untraceability features.
Or they can allow it and try to regulate exchanges with AML and KYC, which could work for awhile but it seems there will soon be decentralized exchanges and that'll be a whole new headache. They're probably better off trying to do a patriot act-era effort and collect data to identify addresses and trace flows.

Honestly the sell-off has surprised us all. It has every reason to go up.
IMO, right now we're in a sell-off/volatility phase that suggests we have quite some time before another bull run. Have no doubt though, crypto (and bitcoin) will have more bull runs to come because it is truly great technology. For now though, the speculators needs to lick their wounds, and big investors need more ability/reason to join (regulation, macro-based compelling reasons)
@_date: 2018-06-24 14:35:41
Miners would NOT want to do any of these things because it basically scraps the entire market and their business with it. China banned exchanges and gave the boot to mining I think, which is why Bitmain for example is geographically diversifying.

Honestly I wouldn’t have been surprised to see the price just go down 
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:23:19
I used to make risky bets in stocks on companies expected to go bankrupt. That shit was tough. You had to aknowledge “yeah news is bad, there are structural headwinds, but the company has some levers to pull I believe which justify a higher value.” 
Bitcoin is easier because even though the price is dropping the news is actually really good. It seems almost certain cryptocurrencies will be formally integrated into world finance, and no institutions own it yet, and there is a fair bit of interest. It’s not that hard to hold knowing that. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 12:28:25

You’re free to input your own assumptions, but $10T for me is a rough estimate that is: higher than gold’s $7T, additional value to account for Bitcoins usefulness over gold (such as being money), and expected growth in the global economy. 
Then there’s maybe a 10% chance Bitcoin becomes such a major asset. 
Alternatively, you can back out the current market’s expectations and see if you agree. $100B/$10T=1% implies chance of success. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 04:52:28
One framework that is interesting and used for lottery tickets is estimating the total end value and multiply that by your perceived chance of success. 
Ex: $10 trillion*10%=$1 trillion fair value.

It depends what the core of the crisis is. Based on the most apparent data, I would expect there to be problems stemming from high corporate and sovereign debt, and also  it to affect the high asset values, particularly home values which are much too high for the fundamentals. 
The fed will need to buy more toxic assets, and maybe go so far as print money to inflate away some of the high debt burden. If that were to happen then bitcoin should do really well, but the economy would be fucked for a long time.

I think our fundamental opinions are just different. Gold doesn't make sense to me and I see it as rather medieval. You can't divide it without machinery, it's risky to hold, expensive to transfer, etc. You probably know all these disadvantages. The point of gold nowadays is an alternative to fiat. I'm not planning for a day when a solar flare destroys the global electrical grid, I'm planning for a time people see fiat as a government liability. I believe the laws of economics dictate that people will naturally migrate to better forms of money over time. I actually think it to be highly probably Bitcoin becomes such an asset.
Regarding valuation, good investments should be easy enough where you don't have to scrutinize variables such as discount rates. When I worked as a financial analyst we took these models too seriously IMO, only to spend too much time in the weeds, and they were often wrong. You want an opportunity that is hands-down a good value. My best stocks didn't require serious modelling because it had cyclical/structural tailwinds and large end markets.
I already told you my assumptions, but I am pretty confident we'll see a scenario where bitcoin is worth $5-$15 trillion over the next 5-15 or so years.

If the next major spike up must be speculation-driven like 2017 then we would probably have wait a long time like 1-3 years. This should be enough time for people who got burned to lick their wounds and let big investors feel more brave.
That being said, I don't think the next major spike up will be as much speculation-driven. I think if the right mix of a political/macroeconomic event + greater availability to institutions will lead to a *real* bull run. This can happen really at any time. If investors don't especially want to sell then we can see a major spike up like 5-10x or more. I also wouldn't expect this to be the last major bull run for bitcoin either.

Because Visa has shareholders that need to be paid billions from their fat profit margins. Trust me, companies do not take such things lightly, and Visa is going to do everything in their power to preserve their margins.

So you’re describing selling activity not supply. Supply means the total quantity of bitcoin. 
So even though bitcoin is being mined, it’s supply is completely independent from price. So on that graph the supply would be a straight line up and would slowly shift right until the last bitcoin is mined. The halving would mean the shift speed decelerates over time.

LTC isn’t differentiated at all and actually it uses bitcoins code. Why would something like that, which is just 5% of Bitcoin’s size, ever be competitive?
ETH has been slow going and just had to lay off a huge part of their development staff. There aren’t any successful ERC tokens either. It’s gonna be stagnant for years.

Price movements are all probability, and bitcoin in particular is notoriously unpredictable. However in my opinion it’s growing more obvious that we’re passed the great crypto winter, and I expect positive year end gains. I would speculate we go to $10K.

For me, bitcoin wasn’t noticeable until it hit $1000 for the second time. I was aware of it but not following it or talking to anyone about it. At that point I started seriously reconsidering my assumption on its future. 
Normies aren’t watching it or talking about it. Once it begins to hit near-ATHs then people begin to feel confident in it and we see crazy prices. Another way to gain notice is if it’s used in something useful. 
It just takes time though because the cycles have been elongating...

Multisig sounds like a wallet defense rather than a bitcoin defense. We'd probably have to update bitcoin protocol to defend against this, and seeing how we can't even agree to a scaling solution, I'd say it's unlikely.

Did it spur spending and investment and stimulate the economy?
@_date: 2019-04-25 07:02:29
I respectfully disagree. The halving is just a mild deceleration in the inflation rate. It shouldn’t be causing triple digit gains in price. On the other hand, the price charts obviously have exhibited a recurring pattern. Bitcoin has done this cycle 4 times already, and we’ll probably learn is a natural phenomenom to S-curve adoption.
@_date: 2017-04-05 17:29:02

Yeah but even if they do get that card there are costs to transferring and exchanging currencies, and it might be easier since you have to again exchange it back after your trip. 
The value proposition for bitcoin would definitely be much greater if transaction fees were $0.05 instead of $0.70 though
@_date: 2017-04-27 16:58:10
I don't understand how freezing fiat transfers causes a price explosion. People can send their bitcoin to another wallet or exchange that CAN redeem it for dollars, so there's no spike in demand for bitcoin. Furthermore it causes anxiety and the price should decline?

This is a good development and really just a piece of a broader narrative in Japan. I would say Japan overall has the biggest banks trying to make Bitcoin a part of major exchanges, which is specifically important for making it available for institutional investors (which is something we REALLY want). As Japan does this, this sends a message to other advanced economies and other institutional investors that this is an important asset, and will cause the price and average volume to rise, and put pressure on other countries to make this available.
@_date: 2017-04-13 21:22:46

The advantage of bitcoin is to defend against inflation and bring/send money to foreign destinations relatively cheaply. It's not quite a micro transaction yet although it can be.

@_date: 2017-04-17 03:38:39
I don't think bitcoin is integrated enough in our financial system to behave as safe haven asset, it's still too new. It's also evident because bitcoin is largely uncorrelated with most macro events. I'm sure it will eventually get there though. 
@_date: 2017-04-10 04:56:50
Think about it...what makes a currency useful is that other people accept it. That's the fundamental basis of its value. Bitcoin SHOULD be increasing sharply as its user base expands. 
A bubble is when prices exceed value in a fundamentally flawed way...such as when the masses buy stocks on debt, or bidding up on a company that will never be able to generate profit, or a pyramid scheme. 
Jean Paul describes the shape of a price curve, which is kind of stupid to use to indicate whether something is a bubble or not. 
@_date: 2019-04-22 21:41:57

This guy doesn't know what he's talking about. The dot-com bubble had to do with companies operating at a loss. Like, no amount of scale could've ever made them profitable (see examples in link below). Bitcoin is a commodity and its scale makes it more valuable. Not to say the value could never go down, but it has to do with how the community accepts or rejects it, so it doesn't make sense to call it a bubble just because growth is high. There would have to be some structurally unsustainable reason behind the high valuation for us to discuss it being a bubble (like people buying bitcoin up on short-term debt)
@_date: 2017-04-04 17:55:07

If the central bank really wanted that level of control a digital currency was possible for decades - they just didn't implement it because they're a slow and unmotivated bureaucracy. 
If the central bank implements digital currency, they will be taking on a role that is closer to a commercial bank. The central bank said they're uninterested in this, and I believe them.
I just think they want to get credit for seeming innovative, and yeah maybe create something that really is more efficient for society. But I don't think there's some objective to increase control.

This doesn’t make sense to me. Yeah they make money in futures because that’s all they can do. A non futures instrument like an ETF for example wouldn’t be under ICE’s jurisdiction. That’s why Bakkt is technically one-day futures...but is actually physically delivered since they solved custody risks. What they’re doing is good. 
Also yeah - you don’t want to launch a platform while the crypto market is in free fall. That’s common business sense. And even as they launch in January, I don’t know what you mean by “influencing public opinion on price”. 
I see nothing nefarious at all.

@_date: 2018-03-18 15:48:05
Just to re-address my point though because I'm a financial analyst by profession: investors definitely do care about a fee rates if they're going down. It would mean Visa were losing pricing power and you would see their P/E multiple deflate quite a bit. Often a business' market position is more important than whatever earnings they reported.

I don't think you fully appreciate the contention through 2017. Segwit was only adopted under the guise of the NYA which was then blocked before it was fully implemented. Bitcoin Cash was born, and is now a top-5 coin. Not good. 
Segwit was great partly because it increased capacity, but a blocksize decrease does the opposite. We do not need to decrease the block size because we do NOT have a decentralization problem. Bitcoins node are factually increasing. Decreasing the blocksize is going to increase transaction costs which are already consistently too high ($5-$20), and lead to lost market share to Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin.
It's easy to admire Bitcoin Core when times were good, but these were very contentious issues and we certainly don't need them again, especially to fix something that isn't a problem at all. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 03:13:10
What he said takes a LOT of balls for a traditional and high profile research analyst to say. Your name is everything in this business, and while you can get away with being wrong with low profile stocks, something like bitcoin you could seriously ruin credibility if you're wrong while having THIS amount of conviction.

Agreed. That's because they're referencing the dot-com bubble in their mind. However with crypto's it's all about *networks*. And if bitcoin provides the most safe, decentralized, and trust-worthy network (with a good pipeline of upgrades), then bitcoin ought to be considered *safe*
@_date: 2018-11-16 04:28:42
Downvoted because this is a really poor comment. 
For anyone that has done their research would know Bakkt is very different and will significantly open up the market. It’s not just clearing and custody from a reputable institution, but also acts as a second layer that’s fast enough to “pay for coffee” with vendors that want to accept crypto customers (and have it converted immediately if desired). It’ll allow for adoption without waiting for the slow development of lightning network (albeit centralized). 
@_date: 2019-04-30 18:18:23

Not entirely surprised. Jihan Wu has taken excessive risk on BCH, and generally has given Bitmain a poor reputation due aggressive manipulation of bitcoin fees and forks, and crude Twitter remarks. 
Bitmain is potentially worth dozens of billions of dollars now and trying to go public, they need to grow out of that stage and become more professionalized.

Typically when there are large sell or buy orders (and this includes any asset, like stocks), traders are hired to take extra time to spread out the order over multiple small batches over time. Gradually doing that is less damaging to market liquidity so you have less slippage (aka lost value because the market didn't have time to absorb it)
Everyone wins if you take a gradual approach to big orders.

Regardless of whoever happens to be buying, they’re probably going to be a stronger holder than whoever is selling right now. We want the weak hands to leave and only buy back in at the top. It causes less volatility since their holdings won’t be as much.

Come on now, we all know things always change, and so it's up to you to rationalize what that change will be. Does it make sense to expect bitcoin to see 85% crashes if it becomes a multi-trillion dollar asset and held predominantly by professional investors? I leave that up to you.

Venmo is great! It’s free and fun because you can see your friends activity.

You’re right it’s not anything like a stock, so you need to think differently. 
For once we hav an emerging commodity- non-sovereign money. It’s valuable because it can’t be debased. If you’re unfamiliar with debasement read more into it, it is a real and recurring problem. 
Valuation frameworks that might be applicable could be a method typically used for lottery tickets: establish an end value (day $8T of golds value), and then multiply it by a percentage probability you think is likely to achieve that value (say 50%), then bitcoins current value should theoretically be worth $4T now.

Actually, most of the investing elite think the US debt will eventually cause a currency crisis for the dollar, as the only option will be to print. Every 1% rates increase will add $200B to the deficit. Some are even betting on it.

I love you. I do think this too. It's super controversial to say this but I just don't think bitcoin is...that risky. Sure it's volatile, and new.

And in a backdrop of runaway government borrowing, this is really the place to be for our generation.

I guess it's perspective. I don't consider it gambling because on a probability-weighted basis it is quite attractive. If I had no money but high conviction in an investment opportunity I would consider taking out debt. This is what people do to start businesses. You just have to understand the risks and make sure you can cover your liabilities. New students don't have liabilities and they're young, so it's not so improper for them to take out debt. Including for education, start-ups, or investing.
But on the other hand, I'm sure their are some seeing this as a gambling opportunity without doing research, and believe they can day trade, etc.

“Litecoin is silver to bitcoins gold”
Beautiful, but doesn’t really make sense. There doesn’t need to be more than one currency 
@_date: 2018-03-17 21:31:53
Yeah because they avoid the massive 5% visa fees. I think this is a huge advantage rarely talked about. Usually bitcoin is just compared to gold or money, but it can also be a super efficient payment network. Vendors will all be offering crypto acceptance, regardless if they want to hold crypto or immediately convert it. 
Holding bitcoin just to see how it fairs as a payment network is reason enough to be long.

If a fedcoin is ever created, it’ll present the most intrusive instrument into your personal finances that has ever been created. This is because there is no way an authority will create a coin without also utilizing it for data analysis, legal enforcement, economic policy, and surely some arbitrary decision-making that will piss a lot of people off. 
I can only assume that such a thing will increase the demand even more for something decentralized, permissionless and private like Bitcoin.

We would need more information. Breakeven might just be variable costs like electricity, and not necessarily the labor, D&amp;A, and such....which if all summed up could be roughly 2.2x “breakeven”. 
The idea isn’t “it’s cheaper for miners to buy bitcoin instead of mining”, it’s whether they are willing to sell their mined bitcoin at current prices. If they view current prices as temporary they will be resistant to sell.

Well, Visa is a public company and as such they will defend their profit margins very aggressively. Lowering rates would only be done as a last resort because it looks terrible to their investors. I would imagine they would rather make overly expensive acquisitions first to try to consolidate the market (ex: maybe Mastercard, paypal, or something). Additionally, Visa just can't compete with fraction-of-a-cent rates per transaction that the lightning network offers. 
The lightning network will be huge if it gains even a little momentum. While Visa can "handle 56k transactions per second" they on average do only 4.5k per second. That's around the bitcoin lightning networks capacity today, which is described as "low thousands".
Good things ahead!

The US government has been very reasonable so far. This is a major plus. Only the scams and shitty business practices are being cracked down on. In the future I think the US is going to try to enforce tracking (part of a global effort), but it doesn’t seem likely to me that they want to restrict it or ban it.

It definitely would! But until producers "catch up" to the higher demand (building more factories), they will in the meantime just raise prices.
And then people might lose some purchasing power if producers don't build enough factories. Economics often has you thinking in circles. It's up to you to decide not where it stops, but which effect is greater than the response.

Ugh. I guess we probably need congress to enact a law that crypto exchanges need monitoring by the CFTC and SEC before they’ll consider an ETF.  Maybe foreign exchanges need similar regulation too. 
Idk why the bar is so high, there are crazier ETFs out there and market manipulation is only bad if you’re trading in the short term.

Currently bitcoin's price doesn't behave like a "store of value". While it certainly could develop that way, as it currently stands it is only a speculative asset. We've been in a downtrend since december, and by all measures geopolitical risk has increased.

Bitcoin can be seen as an investment until it reaches maturity. You’re betting that it becomes a global commodity. 
Also you should tie real estate’s value to price. Since prices are now once again above pre-crisis levels while incomes remain subdued, it’s not a good investment.

I honestly am astonished the price came down this low. It's pretty much a guarantee Bitcoin is going mainstream, if not soon, then eventually, into a trillion dollar market.

It's now up to Venture Capitalists to bring it to the wide market! Remember: HODL

Bitcoin cash is mainly for people who believe bitcoin should have larger blocks. Besides that very-specific point against bitcoin, it has no real advantages over competing altcoins. Lack of greater decentralization, privacy and and liquidity over bitcoin leaves a lot to be desired. Since Bitcoin cash has a very small minority fan base, it probably will always remain as such and therefore I just can’t see it overtaking bitcoin. 
This was the result of a consensus-based outcome and so its abundandlty clear where the common bitcoiner sided. Value and interest did not flock to the new chain.

@_date: 2018-04-25 15:33:40
The way I see it, we want a certain class of investors to enter who are more sophisticated. These investors tend to want to buy low and hold for 5-10 years. They're willing to put a lot of money in when they're ready.
So when the market drops and they enter, all else equal, this creates a stronger bedrock of core holders going forward. When the price rises a lot the next time, less supply is likely to be dumped in response.

Guys - it's ok! Having the crypto space grow is not a bad thing. The closest competitors, who aren't even that close, aren't directly competing with bitcoin. We should be proud the crypto space is garnering interest.

* Understand that these protocols aiming for a hashing power majority is just best policy, not necessarily a technical requirement. It ensures less pain and confusion in the transition process.

Senior year of college. "Digital money...can't be hacked...decentralized so governement can't take it". Didn't appeal to me because I am not afraid of the government confiscating my wealth lol. 
Then the $1000 spike happened....which was insane, but then it crashed hard and then I'd figure it would die. 
Then a few years later I noticed it was still kicking. Whatever. 
Then one or two years ago, I noticed the little TV in the elevator to the office said it had made a good gain. Maybe it was like $400 or $600 at the time. Interesting. I guess people still like it. 
Then my friend told me he ordered weed using bitcoin off the internet. And it was really good weed. But whatever I didn't feel like learning bitcoin and risking that. 
Then I kind of wanted that weed, so he taught me all the craziness on Coinbase to tumbler to Tor. I am actually a financial analyst so I was reading into what bitcoin is along the way, and became really amazed. The fact it was finite was really interesting. Then I read a Wikipedia article "legality of bitcoin by country" and it seemed no major country was condemning it completely. That's amazing because a digital currency would probably be seen as trouble. I then did some research on how much the world supply of gold is worth and any M2 measure of currency...which were trillions. Then I saw bitcoins market cap of $18B! 
At that point it felt like there was large opportunity. I voraciously watched YouTube videos of speakers ( I liked the winklevoss the most). And while I'm not a programmer I trusted them that they did their due diligence on making sure there aren't high technical risks I'm not savvy to. (I did my best to understand, but you never know). 
At this time bitcoin was at a low because of china freezes. I was ok with that and threw in money gradually. Rest is history.

KeepKey is alive and well, though we are going through some restructuring, with all the communication and operational challenges that comes along with that. I can't go into the all of the details now, but there will be some announcements soon (good announcements).
Funds stored by your KeepKey or Multibit are safe, there have been no compromises or anything similar.
We do have support responding to requests. If you have requested support for a KeepKey device, there is a good chance that you have already heard from us in the last few days. If you haven't, you should hear from us soon.
I realize this response leaves a lot of questions unanswered. I hope to be able to provide more details soon.

It's the only yardstick we have to measure how far ahead bitcoin is of its competition. However the next two biggest, ethereum and ripple, aren't really the same...and then litecoin and dash are like 5% of bitcoins size so it's not a big deal. 
Bitcoins brand, longer track record, and better security will keep it ahead in terms of adoption. Its hard enough to get investors to buy into bitcoin, never mind another coin that's new and 5% of bitcoin's size.

The more the idea of bitcoin spreads, the more smart people will realize this is something worth hoarding...holding, very close to the chest. As people do this the finite supply becomes even more constricted. Supply &amp; demand is the game, and supply is pretty much in the bag. Demand shows great interest. It's hard to stress how significant it is to see dozens of countries simultaneously taking an exponential interest in bitcoin. This asset has a bright future, and will certainly outperform traditional assets for decades.

Not really. Banking will always exist because lending will always exist. Individuals don't have the resources to conduct credit analysis, and so its better for a bank to do it.
But yeah banks will lose margin on money transmission probably.

I loosely agree. Bitcoin is a no-brainer investment until $50k, but if it reaches $100k it'll be a buy again because that's a new level of use.

In terms of sheer volume of dollars? No, it'll probably investment-related for at least most of my life. Even with fiat money and FX transactions, most of it is finance-related rather than actual people exchanging currencies. 
It's not necessarily a bad thing though, and these different types of users don't compete with each other either.

* Money doesn't have an intrinsi: a store of wealth it is (bitcoin is finite), medium of exchange (easily transferrable), and unit of account (decimals up to 1/100,000,000th)
* Money is trust. Will people trust bitcoin with the 8 year track record, brand, and good scale/scope in use? Or dogecoin which is like 2% of its size and no one really knows about?
* Bitcoin/cryptos are innovative. They lower costs, raise accessibility, etc...
@_date: 2017-05-16 04:36:12
He's right.
This is investing kiddo! Learn to stomach it. This isn't even bad percentage-wise. Imagine if bitcoin went back down to $1200 and wiped out most of the rally? It can happen. You need to establish your own thesis on bitcoin so you can be better at peace with these fluctuations.

I don't understand how a tech company is lacking the proper investment for so long. Meanwhile they're the most expensive in fees. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:31:12
I agree with OP. The biggest reason is that as volume (liquidity) increases, volatility decreases. The market will be able to better absorb bigger orders. You can already see this with bitcoin:
Another reason is that the community has expanded, both in number and geographic span. As more diverse groups of people enter bitcoin, they're less likely to have the same opinions on trends, and overall act in a more sophisticated way (Adam Smith's "Invisible hand")
@_date: 2017-05-27 02:24:29
Eh I think you're looking at it wrong. Just because it's immature doesn't mean it's worthless. Think of the internet in the early 90's. The potential is there. Speculation plays its part into adoption.

I highly disagree. Bitcoin saw more users sign on recently, from everything I have been reading, arguably EVER for such a short amount of time. Our exchanges were literally unable to process it all. I think you should consider that bitcoin today isn't the same bitcoin from 2016.

Oh adoption will definitely increase, it just won't outpace the massive investment flows. In a situation where adoption doesn't though, bitcoin still makes a very good investment product and I think it can actually stand on its own just from that. It'll be worth multiples from where it is now regardless how it exactly shakes out. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 05:02:58
Interesting. I was reading more into this, found some great insights. It seems that entropy are reasonably secure against quantum computers, but would likely need a doubling in size in entropy for best practice. Then second, the quantum computing development is still mostly theoretical, with current working models typically very small, and the ultimate potential (and required power, which is much higher) is still mostly uncertain. It seems we're safe for awhile regarding that.

I bought some more today at $2400 after selling Ethereum...which I was surprised to read the Casper release will destroy prices (Whoops!). Made a sweet gain though and plowed it into bitcoin.
Yes but to answer your question, I think so. The climb from $150 to $1500 is a lot "harder" than the climb from $2300 to $23,000, know what I mean? There's less risk because we're already seeing very favorable exposure, regulatory, scaling and economic trends. The price went down after I bought it today, but the upside risk is so high I don't regret my decision.
I firmly believe this will be one of the first truly global assets, and is one of the greatest opportunities of our generation.

I mean, my point is regardless of who is saying what, it's up to you as a bitcoin user to form your opinion on common sense. If you find explanations that beg more questions, than it's probably a shitty opinion. 
Anyway, this subject has long been discussed on this subreddit. Search old posts and you'll find many smart people giving their rationale. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 07:23:19
Options? Ugh. Here we go. Assholes making spec bets. 
No one needs derivatives in bitcoin. Derivatives are meant to add certainty in managing finances (ex: a farmer locks in a price to sell soybeans in the future, an airline locks in a price of jet fuel, an investor wants to remove certain variables of risk)
@_date: 2017-05-06 16:45:41
Well gold is relatively finite, but the stock market outperforms it. Once bitcoin matures to a big enough size the price should emulate gold. 
Furthermore, stocks and property are also inflation immune, because they simply raises prices.

Usually inexperienced investors (not just teens but also young professionals) are drawn to irrational investments like penny stocks because they like the volatility. I would have assumed bitcoin would have garnered that same crowd. Maybe because they aren't able or willing to understand it. 
Anyway, good luck. I really like bitcoin's prospects and frankly it's the best risk-vs-reward opportunity I've ever seen. I'm a financial analyst by profession. It's even hard getting my colleagues to seriously hear about it.

Originally the private key (aka seed) was a series of long random letters and numbers. But innovation has allowed it to be represented by random vocabulary words, making it much easier. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 02:42:56
Technically not, but it simulates a big block by taking some info off-chain. That's why it doesn't require a hard fork. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:42:11
Yeah...but us hodlers make legendary returns and we just sit on our asses heh

Yeah no date yet

Central banks don't buy anything super speculative. They buy treasuries, gold, commercial paper, things like that. They'll also buy securities like mortgages to support their objective. They don't even buy equities, so they definitely don't and won't buy bitcoin.

Currency adoption is naturally volatile/parabolic before it matures.
@_date: 2017-05-21 03:24:15
Amazing the density during early on. I still never learned what was going on...but I assume due to the low volume at the time it was probably manipulation. It never lined up with any significant events as far as I could find.

Compound returns are natural with anything exhibiting the "network effect". Think about if everyone who used bitcoin told two people? 
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:31:21
Lol "BTC isn't a company" "it doesn't matter whether...or not"
Answered your own question. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 17:21:29
This isn't true because the higher the price the higher the value. It'll always, proportionally, be a supermassive holding.
@_date: 2017-05-22 02:31:32
I invested all I was willing to spend all at once. I had the cash though. I reckoned there was more upside than downside...I was right.
@_date: 2017-05-15 04:58:34
Yeah, ICOs are definitely going to be judged as illegal without going through the SEC.  They kind of should be. You don't know what these companies are scheming.
@_date: 2017-05-11 03:38:13
It's true, but I think exchanges learn from each other. At least all respectable exchanges utilize cold storage to a good degree. Mt. Gox died for us all.

Luke is gonna split the chain and ruin bitcoin trust if he goes this way 
@_date: 2017-05-21 22:25:19
I agree. Wall Street is brutally competitive and if your colleague is making high returns you need to take their methods into consideration. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 05:18:15
Yeah dude
@_date: 2017-05-21 18:29:38
Exactly. Capital gains for an investment held for over a year is 15%. Calm your tits OP. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 23:07:53
Asset-liability matching. Bitcoin may or may not be worth something in 40 years, but you're certainly going to retire in 40 years! Invest in a stock index ETF instead. Invest any cash besides retirement into cryptos. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 04:40:21
Not a bad idea that the demand stemmed from some new source of demand, like gambling. Worth looking into. 
Regarding wannacry I'd say na. The payments they've received have been laughably minuscule...for the "greatest virus in 10+ years". I bet you it's just natural growth. Remember the exchanges are backed up with new applicants for *weeks* and hardware wallets sold out, and bitcoin network is congested. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:35:36
The only thing Coinbase has going for it is the app. If you take bitcoin seriously move to Gemini. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:36:55

@_date: 2017-05-26 20:20:45
Fuck yeah, CNBC! 
Their pundit owns a crypo asset management firm. So it makes sense. 
Side fact: the CFO of freaking Bloomberg left to join a bitcoin startup. News stories used to be very favorable. (Although since he left are a bit more dry in coverage)

So if you make millions, maybe it pays not working a job for a year to qualify for the low capital gains bracket. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 21:25:33
OR me, gwahahaha 
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:27:33
Yeah, but it would do the job and kill it probably. The coin network would be rendered frozen. 
@_date: 2017-07-15 23:09:37
Yeah but to be fair this community cries wolf with everything
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:02:13
What could this mean for implementation timing?

It's actually smarter if you diversify.

Wikileaks does not have a bad track record at all.
@_date: 2017-05-08 03:40:45
Noooo no no, you can't increase blocksize without a hard fork. Segwit *effectively* increases blocksize but not technically. That's why you see people sometimes saying "Segwit increases blocksize to 2.1mb", or something strange, because it's an estimate based on how much Segwit can offload from miners.
The proof is also right in the post. Why do you think the twitter image shows viaBTC refusing Segwit and then defiantly says "big blocks" if segwit increases blocksize?
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:59:40
Haha "zero?! AWH YEAH! Idiots!"
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:48:07

In an exploding space where you can solidify yourself as being a leader? Yes!
@_date: 2017-05-29 05:12:46
So assuming there are two chains existing indefinitely, how can I use both? Is it really as complicated as making two wallets with two virtual machines...?
@_date: 2017-05-21 05:07:57
Bitcoin is gold/money. If you're familiar with ethereum it's an open source, general purpose blockchain. It'll be used for many applications, like auctions or sports betting for example. Markets that bitcoin probably won't be too involved in. Ethereum is a great buy too! But bitcoin is safer for investment. 
If litecoin grew such that it was coming close to bitcoin, then I would assume the community was very seriously worried about bitcoin's scaling. But for now that's not happening.  
@_date: 2017-05-26 03:41:16
Thank you so much! I just emailed them because I was stressing. Good good. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:19:45
Unless they have specific ideas they're excited about they're just trying to seem smart by saying buzz words. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 05:08:47
Segwit is a scaling proposal. Because of the gridlock trying to implement it, parts of the community want to do a UASF to force a Segwit upgrade, and it's called bip 148. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 23:31:31
Yep. They lose money, then shut up. And more newbs come in doing the same thing. Perpetually
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:59:03
So just to super clarify: once we have Segwit, lightning network can be released when it's ready with no conetentious agreements?
@_date: 2017-05-21 15:59:02
Bitcoin isn't a company. Players won't get complacent because they need to make bitcoin appealing to keep the price rising. If they get complacent it plateaus. 
A monopoly gets complacent because they can generate high returns with no interference.

If it break that price then the chances of it going to $200k or $300k are probably in the bag, because $100k is where bitcoin is becoming an important asset in global finance.

Hey until recently ALL bitcoin news was negative or joked about. I give a lot of credit to Bloomberg as they were the first financial publication talking about bitcoin in earnest. 
They didn't show unfair bias either way, they engaged the subject.
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:41:59
Yes! - It's important us hodlers keep hammering this idea down in this subreddit. Unfortunately a lot of people are entering this space that are missing fundamental concepts in investing.

@_date: 2017-05-22 03:00:58
I don't think Bitcoin is in a bubble (surprise!), because there is a very serious innovative aspect to it, which makes it desirable  for investors to hold, and eventually as it matures, vendors to accept.

@_date: 2017-05-06 18:01:52
Not entirely right. As bitcoin grows with more users and volume you're very unlikely to see anything like 2013 again. And as for that gravity motto, that doesn't work with currency adoption. It generally goes up until it matures.

@_date: 2017-05-17 17:02:31
The only reason i'm aware of is fear of centralization risks. Personally, I think the free market will protect against these risks. Mining power has actually become more diversified than it has been. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:56:46
Oh I see, yeah that's why I was bullish in the short term...but then this huge sell-off happened. But I think it HAS to go up with these trends...there's so much volume of EVERYTHING it's mucking the systems up (exchange applications, regulatory freedom, hard walletz sold out, etc)

@_date: 2017-05-26 05:51:50
Yes. Bitcoin is still so small it NEEDS a rush of speculation and investors before it reaches the critical mass necessary to be stable. Use as a currency won't be until far in the future, but the fact we're even seeing some sign now is great. 
Also safe haven use too. Bitcoin is so versatile!

LLCs are probably mostly like 1-3 man owned businesses. I'd say no. We're trying to ascertain how many large corporations have treasuries that are privy to anticipating ransom ware and stocking up on bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 12:18:04
Just fiat. There's a limit on fiat outflows. But remember every trade has two legs: bitcoin for fiat. Their fiat can't leave the country in large volumes.
But if they wanted to send bitcoin to a relative outside of China (no exchange for fiat), there's nothing stopping them.

Let's also acknowledge there are no rules of thumb in investing. It's all situational.
@_date: 2017-05-28 15:28:05
I hate these articles. They never size bitcoins addressable market which is over 100x it's current market cap. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 01:08:44
I still think you're a little confused...GDP is a flow. You can associate it with income. Stocks values are compared to GDP because they're valued based on the projected cash flows they generate. 
Bitcoin is an asset. Money is an asset. Gold is an asset. Bitcoin can only be compared to assets, which yes, are $100's trillions. Higher upside than you think. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:03:45
Fixed fee. That's the beauty of bitcoin! 
Exchanges charge you a fee too for trading. But sending directly to bitcoin user is just the transaction fee. 
You will have duplicated bitcoins with an amount on both chains to do as you please. 
Exchanges are more sophisticated so I wouldn't be too worried. They usually hold in cold storage for you. But I personally have a hard wallet because there's less risk. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 04:38:08
This guy doesn't understand bitcoin or the economic drivers. Let's not even bring him up.
@_date: 2017-05-08 23:35:29
A research paper trying to track and delineate the different bitcoin users. I tried really hard to find it again but I can't for the life of me. But anyway, it was pretty positive saying how black market participants and gamblers must be a pretty insignificant share now, they estimated at ~5%, based on trading behavior. They had a bar graph with the different proportions of users through time...it was neat.
@_date: 2017-05-29 03:26:47

Cool, any key points you'd like to share though?
@_date: 2017-05-17 04:47:06
Just to give you my two cents: EVERY investment I've ever put money into, has had SOME negative factors to it. You'll rarely if ever find the perfect investment opportunity. Whether you care about the fees or not, the signs show the price still has a ways to go. And for long term? I think scalability will be addressed in some way.
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:40:17
This guy applies stupid valuation concepts
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:23:28
Exactly. This is a naturally trend for anything exhibiting the "network effect"...which means it becomes more useful the more people that use it. I would compare bitcoin to Facebook, because that's the most recent example and grew much faster than say, the telephone. The networks of the future are being laid before our eyes!

Sorry guys. There likely aren't 21m corporations, that have treasuries, preparing to defend against ransomware. But I think the fact regarding millionaires in general is interesting.

This has been one the biggest subjects on deciding whether I was going to buy bitcoin, and after everything I have read I am extremely comfortable how things are going.

@_date: 2017-05-26 21:23:01
I know, "price went down - IDIOT!", right? But the fact is the volumes continue to spike, news coverage is great, roger ver has agreed to the scaling solution, and my aforementioned fundamentals remain intact. I'm hodling. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 22:58:43
Is there any easy guide how to signal? Last time I checked it sounded above my head. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 02:03:11
Doesn't matter. People would use the other half. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 05:40:34
Yeap $2k in capital losses, depending on your tax bracket, should yield you maybe $600 in tax returns. Try to keep detailed records for yourself though. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 17:53:00
Actually not bad at all. Wait until all their peers show interest and confidence in it and then see what they say. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 04:57:21
That's not convention lol. Admit defeat. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 16:01:35
Bitcoin withdrawals actually means buying bitcoin. It's a dumb term. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 06:51:29
Your physical wallet can be destroyed and you can still access you coin. Just buy a new wallet and enter in your private key. The private key is what entitles you access to your bitcoin on the public ledger. 
Private keys in its raw form is a long serial code. Things improved since then and now major wallets instead provide you with like 12 random vocabulary words that represent that key.

Sheesh you want to short bitcoin? Good luck
@_date: 2017-05-21 22:15:25
So this is the proliferation of addresses that have received but not yet spent bitcoin?

Haha oh shit good call in the FOMO, true. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 18:23:34
Well barring any "black swan" event, it is economics that has something becomes more liquid, the less volatile it'll be. You're example is from a long time ago when bitcoin had much less volume.

Finance guy here, the term you're looking for is "floating". The float is what is available. Conversely, the opposite is termed "diluted"
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:34:01
$30B is a very small size for a global asset. It can increase 10x IMO before it slows down. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 16:00:38
Then we move on from bitcoin. It really is that easy. And then Bitmain assets and businesses are worthless. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:47:43
Roughly $20 trillion market cap. 
Could happen, especially as the global economy grows. Back in early-2000s the largest company was like $85 billion, now apple is almost 10x that. In the future $20T might be more reasonable. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:40:24
Don't do it. People who borrow bitcoin probably exchange it for fiat, and so their liability in bitcoin grows very fast. It's bad credit risk.  
@_date: 2017-05-11 07:21:57
Agreed. The Chinese are some of the most aggressive buyers of bitcoin, and only half jokingly: they love a good bull trend. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 01:55:47

@_date: 2017-05-23 17:20:22
I would not say living on bitcoin is practical. Vendors have yet to accept it en mass.

@_date: 2017-05-28 11:13:14
It's true
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:55:09
Thanks and good luck. Careful with the altcoins - super speculative. We're very lucky the regulators have been mostly open to bitcoin, but they're  *certainly* going to require greater identification as part of the deal. Super privacy-oriented coins might not make the cut. I would put the funds in Ethereum instead...the prospect of a "world computer" combined with a future of automation makes the upside enormous.
@_date: 2017-05-07 18:27:52
Ok, but mind providing a source? I can't find any.
@_date: 2017-07-05 04:20:49
Volume has lowered to more reasonable levels, and the backlog is gradually clearing out. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 21:46:32
Uh, they have the potential to give greater access to retail investors to what was exclusively reserved for venture capital firms and rich friends of the well connected. You might see a lot of stupid ideas doing ICOs but these are opportunities to invest in *start ups*
I think this has the potential to shake up regulation around being an "accredited investor" which basically demands you have a lot of money to prove you're sophisticated. 
For example I'm a CFA charter holder but because I'm not rich I don't qualify as an accredited investor. It's ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 03:25:50
Jw, how much does a 17 year old even plan on investing? Do you friends have bitcoin, if so how much do they typically hold?
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:40:34
Why would you invest based on a white paper. It's just theory. You should invest based on the implementation and trends. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 05:17:33
Oh neat. Very cool. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 17:14:11
If the US were to have a huge fiscal crisis where it was seeming like they needed to print money to get out of it, you would probably see asset values drop much faster than the currency at first (ex: stocks, housing, autos, etc), so I wouldn't fret about it. Everything is relative. The USD won't lose confidence because there's nothing better out there (bitcoin is still so small it doesn't count in the current state of things). However bitcoin is still a superior investment.

But the relationship between mining and computation are independent of market price?
@_date: 2017-05-07 21:31:10
Tis the nature of compromising.
@_date: 2017-05-11 02:35:05
He basically doesn't like the price of bitcoin, so it must be a bubble. No knowledge or opinion on what's driving it. Gold is superior. 
What an ass hat. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 18:04:45
We're still way ahead of the 1%. The 1% needs to feel like it's socially acceptable before investing. They need their friends to make them feels it's a smart move. 
The smart money is just starting to watch the charts and learn about it though. They will start diving in the next year. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 03:19:15
If he is wise he'll just buy some more since it's still early days. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 23:00:00
What do I avoid to not make this happen to me?
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:33:06
Demand is bursting at the seams, there is global interest, volatility measures actually declining...and people think the nature of the price trends will revert to the early days. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:25:30
Yeah well of course he was, he always was. This is a compromise. I do hope however he does not fight the agreement as stated. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:36:52
Yeah but on the other hand we were NOWHERE near achieving an agreement. (UASF wasn't consensus either, regardless of the end justified the means)
To be honest this is a good agreement IMO, so maybe we hit a good balance. I can't see developer, exchanges, miners, and wallet providers colluding in an unfair way. They only benefit if bitcoin grows the right way. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:32:21

This is why the government got rid of gold back money. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 14:36:03
Demand is so high it's congested, and the "market cap" is still small by global standards. If you invest not just to make a quick buck you'll be good. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:55:15
Prices aren't THAT volatile. Especially has bitcoin is growing in users. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 20:43:27
* How he sees other fund managers' potentially investing in this space...is it at least a major curiosity, are they studying it? Or is it still too "volatile"?
* Strength in Bitcoin's first mover advantage over altcoins as an investment?
* If virtual currency becomes very popular, could this end up speeding up a credit downcycle? (Since there is a new safe haven asset that generates higher returns than bonds)
* Valuation opinion?

Although amusing, don't take those "signs" too seriously. Investing is more complicating than that.
@_date: 2017-05-23 02:28:46
There's a lot more money that can come in before we reach such a risk. We're not at a bubble valuation if it were just the US trading, nevermind the whole world. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:18:53
There are banks to worry about then ones not to worry about. Fidelity was doing this as a learning exercise, and they only do wealth management. I'd be worried once I see like blackstone do it. It'll a little while before they try a mining operation.

To an extent, because of the annual limit of ~$50k.
I'm not sure if banks/hedge funds get greater leeway. If they do that would be a good thing because it would help equalize prices across exchanges.

@_date: 2017-05-07 21:32:31
dude it's true
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:48:41
Yes but the fact is we *do* have very malicious miners and (outside of this subreddit) many people are completely unaware of this proposal OR view it as hostile. 
As bitcoin grows in users and geographic scope, the average user is going to be less sophisticated, as a result grass roots movements will become nearly impossible (heck, it's even hard to do with shareholders). All major protocol changes are going to need to be based on business agreement, IMO. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:36:01
lol awesome thx
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:06:03

Yeah dude. The massive stockpiles held by the owners is scary too. They definitely are looking to cash out at some point.

Because of killer high demand expectations too
@_date: 2017-05-19 19:16:24
I thought it was an optimistic post but it's actually a shit talk post. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 16:39:05
Maybe because the "risk" has gone down and $20k is more reasonable to expect. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 15:03:55
This issue is so political I don't think it'll consolidate well. Ethereum still has Classic chain and it's even growing right now. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 22:47:58
Interesting. But it sure as hell is being pushed to be instant by developers, which is great.
@_date: 2017-07-25 03:33:52
Yeah but how many people are ok with the agreement to avoid a coin split?
@_date: 2017-07-06 05:25:36
Eh, I'd rather get a bitcoin tattoo than this. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 17:46:46
I don't disagree per se, but how does that relate to the subject about Satoshi's holding's being more or less impactful over time?
@_date: 2017-05-21 21:23:02
A loss in confidence in the technical integrity could send it below. Not a programmer here, but maybe a contentious upgrade could easily wipe out 30-50% IMO. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 04:23:52
There isn't enough hashpower or exchange support either. I'd abandon it. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 04:01:37
We thank you for your brave service
@_date: 2017-05-30 05:02:31
Both chains will have the same amount of coins, it's just that there are now two different protocols/coins. 
Yeah, bip 148 can't work without major support. Most of the business community is taking the Silbert compromise more seriously. I haven't seen UASF support extend beyond a couple hundred nodes and Reddit support...and some developers giving independent opinions. 
Like it or not, bitcoin can only upgrade if the entire community agrees to. Jihan sucks, I get it! But we shouldn't let our emotions get the better of ourselves. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 12:21:35

I think this is possible. Implementations are risky. 
Despite this community's opinion, I think most market participants expect Segwit will be signaled and so it's probably already baked into the price.

So to wrap up, I think the point of this discovery is that the American market is more likely to behave contrarian (i.e. sell off during high spikes, but buy-in during fear and stabilize the price), and that we can predictably bet that any such change will be *continued* on by the Asian market. This is because the Americans on average are more sophisticated investors.
The Americans set the trend, but the Asians push it.
I think we're going to have a fairly good week.

The high price is making the price of computations more expensive, and may slow down Dapp development. Sometime maybe within the next year Ethereum will be moving to Proof of Stake, and as far as I gather (from reddit, computer scientist friends, blogs) that this will crush the price. Ethereum really isn't supposed to be an investment.
I actually divested a pretty heavy stake this weekend while the price still seemed high. It may go up more but it may get decimated eventually.

Bitcoin is the only one with any real brand name, serious investment or formal acceptance. The rest are speculative.
If I can't convince my friends to buy bitcoin, what're the chances they'll buy into a smaller currency that's 5% of bitcoin's size?

Yeah I’m a financial analyst so I don’t need an entire rundown, but I’m still skeptical. Fiat seems more stable since it’s centrally managed, while gold “floats” and is susceptible to market ebbs and flows.

So, bitcoin is considered speculative technology so it may not react like gold does during a recession. Not yet at least.

Yeah I’m sure when you’re bigger you can afford exotic investment that require more attention or expertise which can be costly.

The market cap added is actually a lot higher than what people pay. Tom Lee referenced an oil crisis where every dollar invested yielded $25 increase in market price. 
Bitcoin is a lot higher and depends on liquidity. One time Coinbase had to freeze trading for 2 hours because the low liquidity would’ve let a 75 BTC order push bitcoin from $5100 to $5900. That’s some 40,000x per dollar invested. 
It’s an extreme example but my point is a $360B inflow into bitcoin would conservatively add several trillion into bitcoins market cap.

Venmo won't always be free, they are a business. 
It is actually only allowed for peer-to-peer transactions, not for business transactions. 
Venmo also is very restrictive and sometimes freezes your transactions. I once wrote "Cuban" because we were at a restaurant and they flagged my payment for review lol. 
You can easily make a bitcoin version wallet which is similar to Venmo (connecting with friends).

I feel stupid but I thought Macedonia went the way of the Ottoman Empire. Didn’t know it still existed haha
@_date: 2018-12-13 19:35:35
Yes and no. If you buy bitcoin (using “market order”) you buy from market makers listing a sell price. Same thing with sells. 
You can gauge market activity by observing if the market orders are buyers or sellers. 
@_date: 2019-05-21 18:21:09
I enjoy hearing thoughts. Sometimes people mention interesting factors.
@_date: 2019-05-01 23:24:09
Keep bothering them!
@_date: 2017-05-17 04:17:29
Coinbase is pegged off the GDAX exchange, so for whatever reason GDAX is higher. 
Another possibility, me speculating here, is that Coinbase represents most of GDAX's volume actually, and since Coinbase fees are higher (i.e. 1.5% fee) the sellers simply demand more for their bitcoin.

While studying for the CFA it was mentioned how it’s been demonstrated that traders can’t tell there difference between real price charts and randomly generated graphs. Nuff said 
Also, the greatest investors and investment firms are long term oriented, because it’s the only way you can come close to consistently doing well.
@_date: 2019-05-06 03:31:49
Honestly is not ridiculous at all if you consider the market size and bitcoin's advantages against incumbents. $7T gold + value added of being payment mechanism + anticipated global economic growth + liquidity squeezes. It really could pass $1M per BTC.
@_date: 2018-12-09 01:58:36
I like market cap, you just gotta also look at more than one metric like average volume. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 04:24:42
Nobody has even heard of it there?
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:17:07
I don’t think it’s retail money, they don’t buy aggressively from such a low base. I think a few whales are entering or re-entering.
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:14:43
Well the volume is mostly yen right now so...maybe not yet 
@_date: 2017-05-03 04:41:03
Not unreasonable IMO
@_date: 2017-05-28 11:11:41
What should be and what "is" are two different things. We do run the risk of ruining bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 04:02:35
Nope. Not that I know of. The community isn't big enough yet, so for now just read this sub + bookmark your favorite cryptocurrency news sites. I like cointelegraph, CoinDesk, cryptocoinnews, bitcoin, and bitcoin magazine.

Doesn't sound bad at face value but I can understand superficial relationships can mess with you and be really unfulfilling...
You've done quite well for yourself, congrats. Do you have any views on the future of Bitcoin? It'll be useful to hear an opinion from someone who isn't foaming at the mouth from the prospect of future gains.
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:33:16
Thank goodness. I don’t feel easy anymore when shitcoins are going bananas.

Most people aren’t cut out for financial management, even though we all need to do it. 
The worst are the many gamblers that think that they are.

@_date: 2018-12-16 05:45:22
Statistically speaking yes we’re at bottom in terms of percent decline. 
I personally think all the weak hands were out at $6k but then we had miners and whales that liquidated to finance the BCH fork. 
Calling an absolute bottom is impossible. If you’re looking for an entry point and believe in long term investing, then you can’t get a better deal than right now..
@_date: 2018-12-12 03:57:53
If you want cryptos to rise in value you need to take your coins off exchanges so they can’t be lent out to short sellers. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:35:44
A miner with 5% hashpower proceeds with a fork which only is trading in yuan...and bitcoin gives up almost all its gains from segwit2x. What a pain in the ass. Mostly angry at bitcoin investors for being such pansies. 
Bitcoin feels like erectile dysfunction lately. What the hell does it take to get this thing up!
@_date: 2017-07-01 17:02:52
Because it's just an asset, not an ideology. No sentimentals about it. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:31:24
How did people even buy bitcoin back then? Were their exchanges yet?
@_date: 2019-05-01 18:35:30
Cryptos are considered assets by the IRS so yes same bucket.
@_date: 2019-05-07 04:49:13
It’s not inflation or deflation for BTC because it’s not related to supply. The correct term would be appreciation because it’s related to higher demand.
@_date: 2019-05-15 03:43:36
Some reallly ignorant comments on that YouTube page. Ugh
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:35:16
Probably the miners needing to hedge to cover operating costs. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 14:57:19
Agreed. UASF doesn't have enough support by a long shot, so it'll be a coin split. For practical purposes, hopefully it dies off rather than being a zombie coin. And for the record I want Segwit, but a coin split is bad.

I’m surprised they overextended themselves this much. They should’ve appreciated the idea of market cycles. 
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:56:48
I feel comfortable with my investment choices so I never feel vulnerable to such criticism. And if hard pressed I know I can give more convincing arguments. What more could I ask for? You can’t expect to change minds on something like this.

It could go lower but if you really don’t want to miss the bottom then I’d say buy in now. Timing bottoms is impossible. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 21:53:36
Technically yes but what he probably means is if the market orders are net buying or selling.

This language seems so uncharacteristically close minded for the CFA institute. They were pretty quick to add a blockchain section to their program too...

@_date: 2019-05-01 23:04:04
Yeah generally agree with you. Regarding oil I am not worried about that at all - oil prices are pretty low because the world is awash with oil. Fracking has opened up a LOT of oil for everyone. Our environment will be destroyed before we ever run out. Plus alternative forms of energy and electric motors are coming along nicely. 
Safe haven investors are defensive against doomsday scenarios, but I’m not. I just believe in technology which is why I like bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-06 00:21:30
The government can certainly be creative in overregulating bitcoin to discourage it.

If you borrow to invest in something you need to be very careful. If you’re paying at all time highs you need to be even more careful. If the price trends are going parabolic up you have to stop yourself.

Why do people think there will be a boost in bitcoin buying after a 13 minute episode on 60 minutes? Guys, people don’t make investments like this. I bet you everyone just shrugged it off, maybe have a basic idea of its history. That’s it.

I went in all at once because bitcoin was rising. Since it’s falling though with little history of sustained reversals, i’d say DCA.

holy smokes. So every trade, which obviously has two sides, they made 4%? Ridiculous
edit: I don't yet see it in their fee schedule...?
Edit2: I guess they wanna move away from retail investors. At least I know how to run their Python API so hopefully trades through that are still 0.10%...
@_date: 2019-05-21 00:19:04
But I think of it like a safety deposit box. The bank doesn't have the right to access and utilize it for lending or for their reserve requirement. Therefore it reduces capitalization of the bank...

Nice job on this article. 
Question though, the blockchain chart mentioned within graph “Wallet Users”. It was an impressive number. It doesn’t sound like just represents all addresses being created but perhaps actual registered users of the Blockchain wallet? Or am I wrong?
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:04:58
That’s the top rate. Most people pay 15%. 
@_date: 2019-05-13 07:05:19
I’d say pay attention to the recoveries. It seems like 15-20% recovery is associated with a new bull market. We might already be in a long term bull market.
@_date: 2019-05-25 02:10:38

An artificial neural network could theoretically and with enough training, emulate any type of mathematical model. A decryption seems possible. But that being said, the little I know about SHA256 just seems so incredibly strong I still don't know if it's feasible.
If that were to happen even once the community would need to devise a different and higher quality encryption scheme.

It’s a gradient. I don’t think most people have even noticed bitcoin is going up again. It’s not national front page news and Google Trend searches are only 8% of highs. Plus, anecdotally, even my friends didn’t realize it was going back up.

It can work for awhile but then people taking the other side of those futures will price that activity in, AND crypto traders will expect such movements in bitcoin.

Why? This is bad advice for an asset that is expected to increase at high rates. 
It's good advice for stocks that go through business cycles, but for high growth assets your statistically more likely to make money if you invest sooner than later. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 18:31:31
Interest rates usually include inflation expectations. If a country is expected to have 10% inflation per year, then interest may be 13% per year. If bitcoin in the future is expected to grow 50% per year, interest might be -47% per year. 
May not ever happen but theoretically anything is possible as long as two sides agree.

Yeah probably true. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 16:09:48
Bitcoin is measurably less stable because it's volatile versus every other currency. Bitcoin is volatile because it doesn't has as much liquidity. It'll grow more stable over time.

Well unfortunately upgrading protocols DO require compromise 
@_date: 2017-06-22 03:56:40

When the SEC denied the ETF it was because there weren't enough "information-sharing exchanges". I think that gives us a glimpse into what they're trying to do, and may include all major global exchanges unfortunately.

In currency markets appreciation/depreciation is the change in “price” of a free floating currency, while revalue/devalue is the price of a pegged or managed currency. 
When the Yen strengthens against the dollar you don’t say it deflated...
It makes much better sense to use “appreciation” because it’s due to market demand bitcoin is changing price, not due to expansion/contraction in the money supply

This is weak thinking and is why your bias is yielding you shit projections of reality. The first paragraph is pure speculation, and your conclusion makes no sense nor was it explained *by* your speculation. 
The second paragraph ignores the fact that hashpower is *expensive* investment. That's what makes it more valuable in the event of a fork. 
At this point idk if you're sure why you don't want a HF.

It’s never true a ban is “too late” and can happen at any time with our government. 
Republicans like to look tough on crime and Democrats like to over regulate, so it’s unclear which is even the better party...
Although, the fact that it has lasted this long means there is interest in the innovation it brings, and the only regulatory discussions so far are how to manage the KYC and AML.
Congress is a lame duck but it’s clear *some* regulation will eventually have to come. If that first round of legislation is benign, I would say that reduces probability of a more draconian reversal.

The fed is really interesting, half are appointed and half are from the private sector. Uneducated people tend to hate on them, but one could argue they're the most effective institution we have. 
Would you really want congressmen in charge of monetary policy? They can't even pass a balanced budget. Keep them away. They'd be trying to stimulate the economy every term. 
Meanwhile the federal reserve, while definitely still learning lessons since the Great Depression (we all are), have done a good job enforcing their dual mandate: keep inflation and unemployment to reasonable rates. It helps temper the volatility of the business cycle.

Well stocks absorb inflation pretty well because they just raise their prices in response to higher input costs and medium term doesn’t affect your value. 
What does gold offer over stocks? Not sure because they’re not a productive asset. It’s too antiquated to replace money since people don’t even use cash anymore. I think gold is gonna gradually lose a lot of value.

The major exchanges don’t even rank high at all. Most of the “high volume” exchanges, and I’ve researched this, are based in Southeast Asia. I’ve heard from others there’s evidence it’s faked to attract new users. 
Google trends has bitcoin searches at a mere 8% of highs. My friends didn’t even realize it was even going up. I don’t think there’s a mania yet. 
I think there is a combination of whales buying and maybe Asian retail investors jumping back in.

Margaret will let you know where to meet another associate for the tradeoff, of which you have 1 hour to reach him.

Yeah but it also says it's ranked 5th-6th place behind the USD, EUR, and YEN. The Swiss isn't just going to shoot ahead lol. 
My bigger point is don't compare bitcoin to the almighty dollar. Sure the USD has its weaknesses, but let's keep it more reasonable. Instead I would compare it to third world currencies. Andreas Antonopolous said the average currency only lasts 30 years. Keep your eyes lower to those developments.

You're working backward in your line of logic: The credit cycle is driven by the demand for investment. Investment cycles are driven by the business cycle. 
But at the the end of this chain: the business cycle and consumer spending are self feeding. See the loop here? That's why there are cycles. The fed works to temper it and make sure fear or greed doesn't go too extreme. 
It's not a Ponzi scheme because you're not collecting investment to pay out returns. Your collecting investment to MAKE investment.

I am not speaking to ideals, just IMO what will likely happen. If you have 80+% of the hashing power agreeing to fork, and it's under reasonably acceptable terms for *most people* then it will happen. Nodes don't carry as much weight as hashpower. You know this. 
Sorry it bothers you, and thanks for the downvote, but it's the most likely scenario.

I agree. The first truly frictionless, global asset should command extraordinarily large valuations over the future. Also, the global economy will grow multiples in size over our lives, so what we expect to be $10T today might end up being $30T later. 
However $5T over 5 years as that asset manager suggested might be a little tight, but who knows.

You're wrong to assume players would be worried Jihan would attack his own chain (come on now). Also UASF *is* exposed to attack because of the lower hashrate, and the network will be so congested it would be unusable for two weeks.

I think dollar cost averaging works best if you: don't have a lot of savings to invest now, your investment is exposed to cyclicality, and the downsides are sharper than the upside. 
Cryptos are a high-growth area where you're statistically more likely to make money investing now than later. Like I put my money in all at once in January, and while there was volatility, i'm immensely better off than dollar cost averaging. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 23:21:01

I politely disagree and think it’s mostly just time. Bitcoin will grow through certain phases before it becomes an important global asset. Right now Speculators are gradually handing off risk to long term investors. Bitcoin is incrementally less risky with each passing day and increase in volume and value. 
With lightning network able to provide a way to reduce fees, and Bakkt provides a way to pay merchants (regardless if they want to hold bitcoin or inmediately convert it), we are generally on a good track.

The scaling solution is probably already baked into the price, given that we already have strong commitments and signaling. I think going forward investors will be cautious around its implementation. (Ex: BU had bugs even after a few months.) 
Then we have a hard fork coming 3 months after Segwit which might also cause selloffs.
