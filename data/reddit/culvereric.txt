BTC is a scientific technology. If you want learn something about economics or politics from Tone Vays that's fine. But acting like he is knowledgeable about Bitcoin itself is naive.
@_date: 2016-08-07 00:31:44
But an addreas that has only received BTC multiple times (ex. Paper wallet) would be okay right?
@_date: 2016-04-08 14:28:23
it's worth $0.15 fyi
@_date: 2016-08-02 03:33:24
If he knows NOTHING about computer science how can you take him seriously? Anything technical he just parrots Chris Derose and Junseth.
@_date: 2016-04-23 23:42:59
@_date: 2016-08-01 13:25:25
So just because Tone is a clown and NOT a scientist he is a defacto Steem supporter? 
Also Tone has been wrong several times. Last year when BTC went from ~$250-$450 he said it would go back to $200 before it went higher.
@_date: 2016-04-23 05:04:33
Especially since  $10 could become $100 in this space.

Miners are paid to verify transactions. They are paid two (2) ways.

The only important thing is whether the people who save  $ will gain value or not. If the currency is inflating faster than people can save then we all just spend everything we get. If the value of money remains constant or increases then everyone will be better off. The average person will have more value and living standards will be higher. The whole rich vs. poor argument is just a way to deflect the blame from those behind the get-rich-quick scam of monetary policy to hard working entrepreneurs and the few people who have justly earned their wealth.

The miners do the work of getting Bitcoin. They effectively own all new Bitcoin and are very subject to the Bitcoin ecosystem. They arguably have the biggest incentive to keep Bitcoin working smoothly. I see no problem with the miners having a say in the amount of transactions THEY process.

Someone like myself wouldn't open a channel very often because I don't move my bitcoins that often.

I read the article and I understand the perspective. However I do not think sidechains is bad for bitcoin. I also do not think sidechains will eliminate altcoins. I think people with a similar view as the author will continue to make altcoins. And many, including myself will diversify our portfolios. I for one will withdrawal all my money if for some reason it becomes largely inflationary (monetary inflation). If bitcoin is transferred into something more "mainstream" that is not in my opinion a sound currency then I as well as many will become the fringe minority again.

Is it me or are most languages adopting english words? Is this because they are new words that don't have an equivalent in other languages. It seems like there is a consolidation of languages going on in the world. Probably because of technology. Better communication around the world and common scripting languages. My wife is bulgarian and I notice a lot of words like "computer" and "television" that sound almost the same. Anyways I don't think this comment is related to Bitcoin. Sorry about that. But I guess it shows that we are going to need a currency that works across border, as language is starting to do. What do you guys think?

This is an important part of strengthening bitcoin. In Yosemite national park in California once a year rangers bring blowtorches out to the forest and fire at the giant redwoods. The trees are now virtually resistant to fire. Tech companies routinely try to hack and destroy their own software to find flaws in the tech.

If you think we need taxes to fund defense and roads then you're either retarded or brainwashed. There are private roads and defense in some places already. Open your eyes. The argument "how would such a system work" is also very dumb. The question assumes that one person or a group of people can "organize" society. No one person or group of people know how to run society. Thats why government doesn't work. And when people actually come up with ideas like private defense organizations or DRO's they say "that just won't work". Point is no one know how life will be with institutional coercion. But we should at least try to get rid of it. Cuz the worst thing we will get is institutionalized coercion.

Bitcoin's network can handle 2MB blocks in terms of bandwidth and storage. With google FIBER and with $30 1TB hard drives. But a really high block size (a-la 100MB) in not possible for now. 
Other scaling solutions are important still, but too much shilling against the ideas of bigger blocks imo.

Being rich isn't the important role of Bitcoin with libertarianism. The point is that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies give you more freedom of expression in the form of currency.
You're right, if the government decided to take Bitcoin for taxes instead of USD they could do that. But at the very least it still ruins they're credibility in "organizing" society.

BTC is about CONSENSUS. of which BIP148 does not have. consensus is especially important amongst the core developers
@_date: 2017-07-06 21:51:14
agreed. which is why some Core devs are against BIP 148...the potential for a HF is too risky. (yes I know UASF is a "soft fork" but everyone knows it could split the chain in 2)

Just jockeying for credit. Both sides will want to take credit for segwit deployment. Can't we just be happy we came to a consensus.
@_date: 2015-03-24 20:29:43
Thanks. I think the geat thing about Bitcoin is that most likely people would never want to trade with some sort of bank note (like during the gold standard) because bitcoin is just so much easier to send/receive.

What about a contentious softfork?
a.k.a. UASF
And yes, it is contentious

Success as in remains relevant in terms of price. Not my definition of success but what he perceives it to be imo. But working with authorities will never help bitcoin. I also think he might be a little butthurt about his power to change the b-size being challenged and he thinks that by working with the state he can regain relevance. These are just my opinions. I think programmable money will overcome a lot of potential obstacles. Hopefully the monopoly on coercion is one of them.

You must be new. Or delusional. The Libertarian party is not growing. Johnson won't get any more votes than previously.~1%. And the next election won't be any different. The amount of new people that vote for the Libertarian party will be roughly the same as the amount of Libertarians who leave the party (either by selling out and voting for Trump or becoming anarchists and not voting).

Kinda. Lightning transactions work off chain. So the more you work within the lightning channel the less fees/conjestion on the main chain. The lightning channel is kinda like a bank. IMO. Except now there will be a 1 world currency

@_date: 2016-07-26 14:21:18
for you. You're argument is always the same trolling. What exists is the most efficient. It's retarded. You're the kind of person that would say in 1850, "well slavery is how cotton gets picked, so it's the most efficient way to run society". No moral compass.
@_date: 2018-12-01 06:16:54
It's called logarithmic
@_date: 2017-07-23 01:21:49
no because the code still says block size = 1MB
Segwit is more about reorganizing the chain to fix malleability. More txn's is just a side benefit.

Don't feed the trolls. Bigger blocks wont radically increase the cost of running a node. A TB HD is like what $25 now? 
The downside will be in broadcasting txns./bandwidth speed. (which will get better, but at a slower rate)
