remove your coins immediately upon purchasing them. this is the power bitcoin offers you. if you leave it on exchanges, you're at the whim to their technical difficulties or EULA. if you keep the bitcoin in a wallet you control the private keys to, there will be zero discrepancies. if you've never used bitcoin, i'd practice recovering an address BEFORE sending life-changing amounts of money to it.

So you're Satoshi right, and you're about to share the most important tool in humanity since the printing press. You've been working on this project for a long time. The bailouts are happening. One already happened in September/October. You ANNOUNCE  Bitcoin then in October. The EU says, hey we're also going to start printing money, at that MOMENT, you drop Bitcoin. You disregard that it might not be finished. Like that one bug gavin fixed that let you spend from anyone's account. Was he haphazardous in releasing so early, or did he know (because he's from the future) this date was coming up, and no matter what, his re-compilation of the future code looked like, he was going to have to release it as-is to coincide with January 3rd, 2009?

Prior to a fork, move your Bitcoin to a wallet you control and know the private keys to. Look up how to do this with whatever wallet you're using. When the fork happens, download the fork software, import your private keys, and you'll have access to the forked coins. An exchange might do this for you, but they might not.

I believe Max Keiser when he talks about hyperbitcoinization, and a technological singularity. When the AI discovers Bitcoin, and starts interfacing with the blockchain, humans might not matter with regard to Bitcoin accumulation, and if the AI develops a fondness (greed), that's certainly an intelligent trait humans have, combined with the efficiency of a machine, there might not be a price for Bitcoin anymore, at least in the conventional sense. Owning a full Bitcoin will be unheard of someday. AI gobbled most of it up.

bitcoin on a day to day basis trades based on information. if you were a big evil corporation you'd have to convince enough people to buy or sell, and hedge or leverage your position. however it's been done so many times that the community at large kind of yawns at this stuff. it'd have to be something really serious. to be honest, we are still recovering from the mt.gox news. that's why it hasn't hit 4 digit territory in quite some time. also, we are awaiting news from the more than hundred thousand bitcoins still in possession by the usms. earlier in the year some dummy claimed to of had found "satoshi nakamoto". if the real satoshi signed an encrypted pgp message, and revealed himself/herself/itself/themselves that could affect the overall market in a number of ways. you could also attempt brute force, by buying up mining hardware, and attempt to have enough hashing power under your belt to run a 51% attack, however that option is exceptionally expensive, considering you're competing with millions of other miners with a vested interest in making sure no one entity has too much power.

Now i've had this wallet for well over a year, and haven't been able to spend it since I want to say since July, and we all know the price of BTC has risen dramatically since then. I still have 0.01677111 BTC remaining in this walllet, and I have a feeling the next time I try and take this out Bitcoin will be like $10,000 and that's like $167 on my laptop. I have an incentive to move this BTC around. What is my best strategy moving forward? I don't want to continue to "spam" the blockchain, but what choice do I have? It's my money!
I'm using bitcoin-qt

secure what btc you do own. tuck the private keys away somewhere safe, and out of IRS reach. they will forget about you. move out of the country, and spend your btc in a btc friendly locale. worst case scenario, you'll go to jail. by the time you come out, your btc will be worth a whole lot more. either way, be smart about your btc, be smart about your money
@_date: 2014-06-26 00:19:24
seriously. the only people i think that are mining, are the ones that bought a boat ton with the futures contract when they were dirt cheap like around 0.0029 a GH/s. i honestly can't fathom why someone would want to drop any kind of serious BTC @ 0.007 per GH/s

I distinctly remember ordering a jalapeno, and hearing that a few media outlets had one, and thought, they were real and existed. they existed, however because i didn't receive it for 8 months there was significant opportunity loss. i was reassured two weeks, and the two weeks never came. i had a gut feeling that if they had the devices, they were most assuredly mining for themselves, and we the bitcoin community footed the bill. yes, i took a risk, in placing my trust, and i'm less naive, but that doesn't change the fact that i'm pissed off. this company deserves whatever is coming their way.

i only think that we are JUST beginning to figure out a true face value for this technology to be effective. in order for bitcoin to reach 100 trillion USD market cap, each individual bitcoin will have to sell for 4,761,904.76 and even THAT is conservative, considering that there are some BTC that's already "lost", or unrecoverable. so coinbase selling BTC for ~~$800 is a steal. really it is. the exchanges will be richer than banks. this is why governments fear the threat of BTC, and emerging cryptocurrencies pose to their business model. it has the potential to redistribute wealth on such a mass scale. especially when businesses adopt it. the early adopters, they will be the ones who "profit" the most. this is why government are trying to "nip it in the bud". they don't want this technology to scale to that size, especially if they can't control it. humans, we have the potential to truly change this world, and fix a lot of the problems we face. regulations won't kill this. it will grow, and it won't stop growing. this technology has the potential to perpetually redistribute wealth, forever. stick with bitcoin for the long haul. i promise you, you will not regret it, ever. period.
@_date: 2014-02-07 09:29:52
the people who mine alt coins are the early adopters of bitcoin who are putting their old gpu-rigs to work. so it's more about getting into more than just one pie. when scrypt based coins get their asics, we're going to see a revolution occur in the alt coin space. for the mean time, a lot of them are manipulated in pump and dumps. there's money to be made in that if you're a player/pumper

I lost 4 bitcoins, a sizable sum at the time. I was distraught. I have recovered a little. More than my bitcoin, I want the truth of what truly happened. I have a feeling that Mark Karpeles is definitely hiding more than what he leads on. I'd love to have my bitcoin back, however I'm glad that mtgox wasn't immediately bailed out. It rose awareness to security. I think the exchanges and services that many use today are held to a much higher degree of accountability. It's bittersweet, but I'm still a believe in this technology. It brought fiscal power back into the domain of the people.

i'm one of the younger enthusiast of bitcoin. i looked at it as a long term investment. i have ~~5.5 BTC tied up there. now while that may not seem like a lot, i have sacrificed so many paychecks to attain those 5.5 BTC. if mtgox doesn't do the right thing... i just don't see myself trusting bitcoin in the future. even if it hit a million dollars per btc, i'd only remember THIS. this brief period in time. when i sacrificed SO MUCH, and lost it all. i really hope, and pray that MtGox will do the right thing, and resume withdrawals, both fiat and especially btc. this will leave a permanent dent in this community if they don't.

@_date: 2014-02-02 08:47:30
obviously $5m per BTC overnight is unrealistic, but in 4 or 5 years, this figure might be looking more realistic. i don't care what stock you own, what portfolio you have, i promise you it did not appreciate 5000% last year the way bitcoin has. humans are rather finicky, if we see S-Curve models pointing upwards, we say, this is too good to be true, and take our money out. if you're a seasoned veteran, you sell when it peaks, and buy back at an exceptional discount when it depreciates exceptionally. this attracts attention of new investors. new investors maintain the norm for a couple of months. repeat cycle. there is always money to be made. that's why on reddit, you'll always hear from the naysayers, and speculators. they want the market to crash, to buy back their btc cheap. btc is designed for perpetual growth. combine it with the fact that it's convertible into the most popular currencies around the world, and this means that the growth is coming from all around the world. call me crazy, but $800 is a bargain. 2013 was the first year that i want to say institutional size investors got on board. we're going to see more and more for years to come. here's a decent read/video

This is me 
I've been vegan for three days now, vegetarian for at least a year. I'm riding the bus to my job, the one I go to six out of seven days of the week. I've watched all the zeitgeist films like a million times now, and am totally an advocate for a more sustainable and fair society here on planet earth. Because Bitcoin removes the state from money, I believe in it's future potential and practical utility. For the first time in history, the power to mint currency is in the hands of the people. This week I've given away $25 worth of bitcoin in five dollar increments to my friends, and at least one, my best friend, is signed up to an exchange and buying. I'm totally all in. Any extra money I have, I buy BTC. My stash is growing, and I'm never selling. I might use some of my BTC when it's "high", but I'm never selling. There are speculators, and then there are believers, and I'd rather this community be filled with the latter. In the coming days, I'm going to read Andreas Antonopoulos's book, about "Mastering Bitcoin". I want to learn the nuts and bolts of this. I've mined three times, once prior to ASIC's, 56 nm, and 28nm generations. I quickly realized that mining is exceptionally competitive, and the only practical way moving forward is directly purchasing Bitcoin. I love talking about Bitcoin to people, and getting a job in the space, with a wage paid in bits, would be a dream fulfilled that didn't even exist a couple years ago.
Merry Christmas to all, and be blessed

this technology is in it's infancy. when the reward halves again, i think that's when we're going to see any kind of major increase in price. i would cite 5 million per BTC as a long term valuation (+10 years). i see BTC as THE major crypto, and the others with their own niche markets as supplementary, with their own agendas. BTC is where all the attentions at. i wouldn't get too caught up with the 5 million figure. that's my personal number that i'd feel comfortable "cashing out" at. yes, i'm that optimistic.

let's face it, bitcoin is only going up. it has occasional hiccups, but the longterm trajectory is upwards. I make the argument that anyone, not just a Western Union, but me and you for instance, I could spend $50 today on BTC, and in 2020 when bitcoins are a million bucks a piece, that fraction of a bitcoin is now worth in the ballpark range of $100,000. i could save money in the long run by utilizing it later when the valuation is high. in this example by a multiplicative factor of 2,000

yeah, i actually bought earlier today at like 780, it was like the middle of the day, wish i would of waited, but yeah, the rebound is quick, and strong! that's what i love about btc. especially when it's been stable at 800 for a couple weeks. there is definitely an incentive to bring it back up, and in doing so, might actually raise the price higher than the crash, ha ha
@_date: 2014-02-02 08:36:05
$100,000,000,000,000 divided by 21,000,000 BTC equals $4,761,904.76 per BTC
granted, not all BTC has been mined yet, but this is future values we're talking about here. In 2140 it's totally possible for $100 trillion market cap to be realistic. in the meantime we're going to witness the value of BTC climb. I actually think $100 trillion is conservative.

the difficulty also rises today, which is why they can't justify charging the same btc for lets say an S3, but they can charge whatever they want for an L1. i'm assuming the L1 will be akin to the S2, in that it will have it's own PSU, and have blades from the S3
@_date: 2014-10-23 09:46:19
Example, the going rate for a full Bitcoin right now is about $370. If you owed a hundred friends  $3.70 each, to pay them in Bitcoin, you'd send them 0.01 each. Or if you had a thousand friends, and owed them $0.37, you could send them 0.001 BTC each
@_date: 2014-09-21 06:48:00

In China you can start a mining operation, and get both the hardware, and electricity subsidized by the government, if you know how to play your cards right. That's probably your best bet at making a return. Small guys like me and you, not a chance. At $400 a BTC, returns with the highest efficiency miners on the market today, are projected at around five to six months, and that's assuming the current difficulty (which is about to shot up twenty percent in less than four days) stays the same. Even some larger operations are even having trouble justifying staying in business much longer

You might have luck with localbitcoins.com , You'd have to get in contact with someone with 100K worth of bitcoin. You can determine that they have the coins by having them send you a signed message from the address they intend to release the coins from. There are numerous security risks that you have to take into account, so this route might not be viable for you. It requires some degree of trust.

well it depends. what's the hashrate? what size is the chip node (65mm, 28mm, 20mm)? what's the brand? what's the efficiency?
generally speaking, most miners are looking right now to roi, in about 6 months on the lower end, 3/4 months on the higher end. the secondhand asic market is ripe, especially if you do it, just as the price is going up, you can resell your asic at a premium if you time it just right

I should also mention that this week they arbitrarily lowered the price on their umisso contracts from 0.00135 to 0.001125, and "credited" everyone with 20% more hashing power. While I'm not complaining, I might not be able to realize those gains at the 0.00135 price when the umisso market opens up.

A sly nod, a tip in the jar
@_date: 2015-05-13 03:52:15
I'm not sure why I even worded it like that, I'll simply be homeless.
I indeed have a part time job serving at a restaurant, however the costs of living outpace the income I earn. I believe in Bitcoin, and it's power. If a handful of strangers from anywhere around the world can help me out, then that should speak for its legitimacy as a platform to raise capital fairly quickly.
I live on Maui, and if you're not deeply ingrained into the economy here, it's pretty easy to become homeless. It's also something that isn't shamed here. This will be the first time in my life that this has occurred to me. I was in a work exchange program that expired, I have to fend for my own.
I intentionally didn't post a BTC address for that very reason. I could have easily posted one, made it public, and "got rich". You don't have to trust me. No one has to trust me. If it's in your heart to contribute, then do so. If not, don't. I don't really have a "reputation", other than occasionally going on the bitcoin subreddit, and posting something, but if you'd like I can PM you more personal details, and you can get a "feel" for me.

I would represent a wish, someone would want to make future bitcoin economies, we'd introduce our 25 million worth of bitcoin, to help build infrastructures in that community. We start with ten places we want to all change at once, and utilize this asset more and more over their fiat, because bitcoin is rising, and it stops when people don't use it like one, and "hoard". The very first communities, preferably to a very poor place, where 25 million worth in bitcoin could go a long way. I'm a pioneer on a frontier that hasn't been charted yet.

thanks for the offer, but i just want these transactions to go through. i made a transaction on coinbase, but it's on hold because one of the inputs is from this wallet, and it hasn't cleared yet, so i have to wait 24 hours for it to automatically cancel before i can try again, sans-pending transaction.

yes but the fees themselves are worth more than the btc i'm moving
@_date: 2014-06-05 06:56:35
they'd probably need quantum computing power, at which point, the core developers would probably have to do a hard fork of the blockchain. plus because bitcoin has a ledger that's public, anyone could see that. there might be a few people that own a percentage of bitcoin, but i doubt any single entity is in control of double-digit percentages. that might change as time goes on, but right now... no. that's just simply not the case

I think the Chinese miners have the most to lose in tx fees, if Segwit/Lightning network comes online. However, if the price goes hyperbolic, and hits $1,000,000+ that issue is mitigated, and there'll be practical economic incentives to preserve the integrity of the network, so as to avoid what happened with Ethereum. My personal solution, and I'm not technical in any sense, would be to preserve as much of the code as possible, implement a free-floating dynamic block that automatically adjusts in size with regard to transactions in a block. With that said, I think that the SegWit team is approaching the issue correctly by waiting for 95% signaling, before implementation.

Ethereum split in two competing networks. The "official" version, and "Ethereum Classic" that wanted to preserve the integrity of transactions from the "original" chain

Bitcoin needs a cryptographic social network. Anonymity by default. I mean sure, we can leverage an already existing platform like Facebook, to use Bitcoin. However a legitimate startup, from the ground up, would be much more disruptive, and effective. Adding as a "feature" on FB, would likely go unnoticed, or underutilized. Think about this, having a platform to easily send money to friends and family, in the style of PayPal. It would deal exclusively in Bitcoin, and it'd be up to the individual user to exchange them on another platform for fiat
@_date: 2014-11-23 20:11:14
Because Bitcoin has utility, when you mine it, you don't necessarily have to trade it on an exchange, you can utilize it to purchase goods
@_date: 2017-02-27 06:43:37
the idea being that larger blocks would take longer to propagate... thus increasing the likelihood of orphaned blocks? fascinating... the longest chain is the gospel, so if you were a pool, fudged your block with your own transactions, creating a larger block, you could potentially start work on the next block earlier... and the next block... so forth and so on...
here's the thing, 5G will be a thing in a few years, and i think propagation will figure itself out in china... the blockchain size is already huge, but i think those costs will be offset by a really-really-high-priced btc, and i think it'll happen sooner than later, so there'll be demand to fix scalability. i just really hope we make the right choice, and don't rush into SegWit or BU or whatever, only to realize it's buggy, and wallets aren't ready...

I agree. When I was telling my best friend about Bitcoin, he's like, "that's cool and all, but how do you make money off of it?", and I'm trying to explain to him that Bitcoin IS money. We need to get that mentality out. Don't get me wrong, it's nice to see it grow, but it has to be an organic emergence. I think with what gox was doing it's bittersweet. But now we can start from scratch, and distribute coins to as many as possible

@_date: 2015-01-08 17:01:07
I'm friends with people who've been burned by MLM (multi level marketing) scams, so they're hesitant to jump in. They think I'm trying to sell them something. What I do is have them set up a wallet on their phone, send them $5 worth of BTC, and show them the practical utility of it. The huge elephant in the room though is when someone brings up Mt.Gox. Mark Karpeles has done so much reputational harm to Bitcoin, and set Bitcoin adoption back a couple years. Sure the Mega corporations will be first in line to accept our bits, but they're meaningless unless we can get them in the hands of people. So that's my strategy. I give BTC away charitably. How people choose to utilize it is up to them.

There almost always will be downward pressure, because you wouldn't want a currency to exponentiate too quickly. Although immediate credit cycles might make it appear to grow too quickly. This is high risk, high reward. As time passes, Bitcoin will surpass in faith to most fiat currencies, because at the core of its product, is something similar to cash in value, but in a secure digital form. This promise more than anything should incentive miners to keep a stash growing for personal as well as savings as a store in value. The economics of building a deflationary currency that is collectible and increases in value over time should be reason enough. I just want to be first in line to buy as many as possible, in the near to immediate future.

if you're a really large bank, or someone with lots of money, and you're trying to hide it from the prying eyes of a government entity that wants to tax that money, it'd be really easy to hide it in bitcoin. especially at 100 trillion market cap. it'd simply get lost in the blockchain. granted it's public, so really anyone can see. but unless you voluntarily gave the IRS or any "authority" the address to your wallet, your BTC are safe, and away from the prying eyes of taxation entities.

Someday, a single Satoshi will reach a single fiat-note parity, and it'll be worth it to harvest the coin. Today, in our current state-of-affairs, probably not.

it's not going to show up on your main balance. the trick is to not have any incoming or outgoing transactions from your bank for a while. get an accurate number for what your account balance is. request coinbase to charge your bank. you should see a a difference in your pending balance. maybe like -$3.31 then figure it out the hard way. in our case the difference is 3.31, what two sets of numbers both being at least $1.00 will reach 3.31. try inputting them until you get it. so start with $1.99 and 1.32, if that doesn't work try $1.98 and $1.33, and so on, until you guess it correctly. that's how i set my account up. it's a hassle, but you only have to do it once. i'm assuming you're trying to verify so that you can activate "instant buy". the alternative is phoning your bank, and risk them shutting your account for playing around in the bitcoin space. although wells fargo, i think are trying to implement bitcoin into their business model, so it might not be all so bad

This is good for Bitcoin. I think Coinbase has done a great job so far. Sometimes they bend to the government's will, but allowing users to control their own private keys is always a plus.

You're retarded brotha, Bitcoin is more than 1's and 0's, it's a decentralized, censorship-resistant asset, that affords one autonomy from any nation or state. Sovereignty is one thing, economic sovereignty started in 2009, when the genesis block was mined. Don't believe the FUD. Read the white paper, look at the code, if your brain doesn't start clicking, you can't be helped. Bitcoin is the most important invention yet. I'd say it's right up there with the printing press. Mass adoption is coming. Concern yourself with holding on for dear life, that's a fool-proof strategy. You'll always have your Bitcoin if you hold.

The blockchain is the underlying protocol behind Bitcoin. It's a public ledger of all transactions. It is maintained by Bitcoin miners who are incentivized to mine, because of a block reward that gets solved about every ten minutes. Blockchain.info is a website, that publishes the Bitcoin blockchain. If that site were to shut down, the blockchain remains unaffected. There are other websites that let you explore the blockchain as well.

I will make and send for you. i.e. - want to send like 15 seconds of Gangnam Style? No problem. Want me to send some family video on your YouTube account, no problem. Send a Snap to user: dripdropwet and I'll send you a sample video of what I'm talking about. Be sure to include a hashtag like  or  or  just so that I know that's what the snap is for. I'm very active on SnapChat

i'll offer a discount if you mention you're from reddit. the original price is 0.01, but for you guys 0.008
pm me beforehand

okay, so here is some advice that might REALLY REALLY help. Go to your main browser, in this case I will assume Google Chrome, because this is how I know what to do, what I am about to tell you.
From Google Chrome,
Go into SETTINGS &gt;&gt;
click "Show advanced settings..."
under "Passwords and forms", if your husband
had the box "Offer to save passwords I enter on the web" ticked,
then click on "Managed saved passwords", from there you can
see which sites (hopefully Bitcoin exchanges, and mining pools he was a part of) he was a part of, and their passwords to access them. Some
exchanges like Coinbase might ask for what's called "2-factor" login. This is an extra layer of security. Look for an application on your husbands phone called "Google Authenticator", this will give you the required set of numbers to login to sites that require this method. I know that you can do something similar from Mozilla, but not so sure about Internet Explorer. I really hope this helps in your investigation, and I'm sorry for your loss.
If you have any questions, feel free to email me, sirluismiguelrivera or 
PS - I would look into selling his bitcoin mining equipment, it may fetch a pretty penny, especially on Ebay.

sorry, i just noticed this is a repost. this is actually who i got it from, via their facebook post. here's a link to their reddit post -&gt;&gt;&gt;
@_date: 2013-11-09 07:56:16
what should i do?
i get it. actually i have an alternate blogger account that i haven't updated in a while luismiguelrivera.blogspot.com
i had this idea, and i'm really excited about it, and this is my best effort, how should i move forward?
the reason for the 0.01 minimum is because i have an alternate wallet that i can't send any money out of because it's filled with a bunch of really small micro-transactions from a faucet service. and i wouldn't want this new wallet to be plagued with the same problem. here check it out yourself
@_date: 2013-06-21 15:02:12
this is great! thanks!
@_date: 2013-05-25 22:19:46
i'm not sure how quick you can do this, for me, it was about three days (to verify my bank account), but open an account on coinbase.com and you can sell your bitcoins there, and have the money wired directly to your bank account.

that guy on the right, the banker, is so sketchy. does anyone else get that feeling. like he knows he's met his match, so why not intentionally set misleading information out there, and insist that it's accurate. his kind of scare tactics are deplorable.

guys, schemantics. this is my idea, sorry it came out all at once, in a single stream of consciousness, and i didn't make the effort to punctuate it. read the message. it's pure.
@_date: 2013-06-30 15:49:32
i would save a little more and buy from these guys:

oooh la la,
here you are
THANK YOU!
@_date: 2013-05-21 02:19:50
i've emailed the guy everyday for a while, no replies yet
@_date: 2013-05-25 21:32:30
yeah, i have a local wallet on my computer that gets funded from those occasional free btc faucets, the only thing is that i can't pull any of the BTC out because it hasn't "matured" enough (100 days old), without incurring ridiculous transaction fees. if i were you, i'd use an alternate online wallet, like mtgox, and use them to fund your btc-e account, that way you can avoid paying the transaction fees
@_date: 2013-12-27 02:29:35
yeah, i know it sounds bad, but when i was moving money out, the fees were larger than the amount i was sending, and i was like, thank god! now i don't have to worry about it. i'm trying to start from a clean slate too. i need my wallet to be as tiny as possible. how much more btc would you suggest that i add? 
@_date: 2013-06-05 06:49:33
basically. if they're giving away a free/faux currency, i want to cash it in for a REAL crypto-currency
@_date: 2013-06-06 05:52:45
i got you. what's up ;)

this just makes me really sad. i honestly thought and felt like they were running a legitimate service. You can't even get on the site anymore. It just redirects. I've been trying to email the guy for a refund, and I have gotten no response. I provided transaction ID's and all that jazz. Of course, they're all marked as "Spent". I only lost 1.05 BTC, but I feel really sorry about the guy down here, that dropped 33.5 BTC, that's so much money, and it's all gone now... hopefully, he/she will do the right thing...
@_date: 2013-06-13 17:41:13
i upgraded mine. i was an april order, so who knows when i'll get mine. 2 weeks, seems to be the rhetoric, but i really believe in them. they're trying their best, they just have a really big plate, and a lot of hungry people. Order# 100039516 just in case there are some generous BFL engineers, who just so happen to read this comment ;)
@_date: 2013-11-17 01:13:34
i did a campaign on there, and recieved a bunch of microtransactions from them, the only thing is that they'll clog up your wallet
