You should run a bitcoin exchange for you customers as part of your online banking system. Customers could transfer BTC into their accounts, and trade them and their USD holdings  freely on the exchange, but *only* with other of *your* account holders.
Ostensibly you have bulletproof records on your account holders, so if law enforcement comes a'knockin you know exactly where the funds came from and went to. "Thank you officer have a nice day."
You would instantaneously take the lion's share of the BTC trading/holding market in every company you operate in. Seems like a good opportunity to me.

I'm really trying, friend! Why do you think I keep asking you questions?
Here's what doesn't make sense to me:
You're claiming that we can have legal systems that are completely opt in. Then you claim that if I do something bad to you I am subject to your legal system, even if I am residing outside of it's jurisdiction.
That's a contradiction. Either I am subject to it, or I'm not. Here's an example of two situations that are legally indistinguishable under your system:
1) I murder your son in cold blood, return to my home and refuse to participate in your legal process. Your legal system rules that I have to pay restitution. Your police come onto my property, force me onto a tiny corner of my lot, build a fence around it and claim the rest of my property for you to take as restitution.
2) You decide you want the copper on my land. You're the mayor of a big city with a crooked police and court system.  You have your son murdered (who was encroaching on your power) and frame me. I refuse to participate in your legal process. Your legal system rules that I have to pay restitution. Your police come onto my property, force me onto a tiny corner of my lot, build a fence around it and claim the rest of my property, including all that copper, for you to take as restitution.
Your legal system (the social contract of anarchism you're advocating) makes no distinction between  and  In the current U.S. legal system, I can file a series of appeals to higher courts. Eventually, yes, someone could pull the wool over the Supreme Court's eyes and get some fraud through, but you'd have to do it over and over in a series of courts. Under your legal system, any rinky dink county court could just seize my assets and I would have no legal recourse.

The way I see it, there are two kinds of decentralization, weak and strong. Weak decentralization just means the work is split up amongst many players, but you still have to trust someone. Email is a good example. It's decentralized, but you have to put 100% faith in your email provider to transport and store your messages. 
Bitcoin, Tor, Bittorrent, etc, are strongly decentralized. That means not only is there no central authority, but you don't even need to trust smaller authorities. The protocol itself provides service guarantees. Your transactions will be confirmed, your packets will be routed, etc. You only need to trust yourself and the protocol.
The proposed exchange is weakly decentralized. What we need is a strongly decentralized exchange. 
Ripple appears to be such an exchange. And colored coins can in theory provide the same, although to my knowledge no one has yet put together a proposal. I'm not aware of any other "strong" decentralized exchanges.

Out of curiosity, have you thought much about whether that would be a bad thing? Maybe everyone's way of life would be disrupted, but do you have reason to believe it would affect things of importance, like the number of humans living below a quality of life threshold?
That's a genuine question. I honestly have no freaking clue. I just hear people talking about "global financial collapse" as if it's some sort of obvious disaster. From what I can tell the global financial system has two parts: 1) providing much needed financial services to people who are running businesses, and 2) coercing people into taking debt they don't need so a percentage of their income can be skimmed off the top forevermore (the World Bank and Visa being prime examples). 
Obviously 1) is important and 2) is nefarious, and I don't know what would happen to either under "global financial collapse".

I don't get this line of thinking at all. You could, instead of buying shares, just buy the Bitcoins and hold them. So it's only a good investment if you can make money *relative to what you'd make sitting on the Bitcoins*.
I ordered a BFL miner, and I have a good shot at making my USD back... and it's a smallish amount of money so I'm not worried about that.
But I spent money that could otherwise be sitting in my BTC account, and what i *am* terrified of is that if BTC goes up while I wait for my preorder I'll miss out on that. So with respect to this investment, I'm thinking purely in terms of Bitcoins. The USD is immaterial. The only question is: will I make back my 18 Bitcoins.
Seems like a similar thing applies here. The only question is: Will you ever recoup those 1.3 BTC. If it relies on an ASIC miner still having a meaningful in the face of 2 years of difficulty increases.... I have a hard time believing you will. But maybe.
As for USD, yeah, you might make it back after 2 years, and have missed out on 2 years of Bitcoin growth.

This is why the whole "deflation" argument doesn't make sense to me. That statement just sounds completely absurd to me. Demand will outstrip supply *forever*? If demand will outstrip supply forever, what's preventing the price from rising until the demand curve flattens out? Isn't that just what happens in free market systems?
Isn't that the *point* of a free market system that no matter what the dividend schedule looks like, once the market is fully aware of the schedule, it will coalesce on a stable price? And only when the market's understanding of the dividend schedule changes does the price change? Fixed... growing... shrinking, it doesn't matter... all that matters is whether the market's *understanding* if that curve changes.

If we settle on mBTC and the price goes to $100k then we'll have ended up right back in the same boat.

I ordered mine with Bitcoins, so it doesn't matter what happens to the price (up or down). All that matters is how long it takes for me to recoup my investment in BTC.
In that sense, buying a mining rig is sort of a hedge against a drop in BTC price.
That said, I ordered it because the worst case is a slow or partial break even, the best case is a decent chunk of "free" Bitcoins, and no matter what I'm helping decentralize the network and doing a fun, nerdy project.
And even after buying the rig I still have orders of magnitude more value in coins than what I put in in USD.

I suspect it's only going up from the 1.8%. *Several* organizations are working to dump 20+ TH/s capacity *per month* into the network. My projection is that hashrate will double by June, and hit 1000TH/s by September.
As someone with a (very late) preorder for a BFL single, that scares me. I'm got 20 coins down and I wonder if I'll even see one of them back.
The other part of me is optimistic that the current hesitation about the profitability of ASICs will keep demand low enough for a while that I'll be able to earn my coins back in the Fall. Who knows.

Yes. Them and people with "free" electricity. I wonder how much mining will end up done in college dorm rooms and under peoples' desks at work.
For me, I just want to mine my investment back before we hit breakeven. It's a question of how many people are gung-ho enough to jump in and drop the cash on an ASIC in this time of uncertainty.
I may mine long term, for the fun of it, and to provide decentralization to the network, but it seems likely I'll just end up selling my rig to someone with cheaper electricity and less thorough calculations.

It's not just the encryption... Imagine if Bitcoin didn't have the mining process, and instead of a proof-of-work secured blockchain, you could assign your transactions to a blockchain provider, and they would be the source of truth on the blockchain for their transactions. These blockchain providers would be federated, so you could pay from a wallet in one blockchain into another, but you had to rely on the blockchain provider to clear your transactions.
That's still decentralized, and it's still encrypted (you still have to sign your transactions) but the blockchain is not truly p2p, and is "weakly decentralized" by my definition.

Colored coins are fascinating from a Metcalfe's Law perspective. Because they are build on top of the Bitcoin infrastructure, new CC currencies actually stand to benefit from some of the Bitcoin network effects. They can use existing Bitcoin open source software, they benefit from growing hash rate, etc. 
They can't take advantage of every Bitcoin network effect... For example, you may not be able to trade them on exchanges unless the exchange supports colored coins. But they are not totally isolated the way that, say, Google Plus is isolated from Facebook.
What that means is Bitcoin could grow very strong, and a new CC currency could emerge and be able to compete directly with "vanilla" Bitcoin for large segments of the Bitcoin market. When we talk about the possibility that the Bitcoin economy grows to a $100B or $1T or $10T market cap, that value could be split up unevenly between various colored coins. If the "Bitcoin" economy is worth $10T, but $9T of that are in a colored coin with, then the effective market cap for your "vanilla" Bitcoins is only $1T, and the price of your vanilla bitcoins will be a fraction of that lower cap.
Until recently, I saw my Bitcoins as a fixed share of the Bitcoin economy. But I realize now colored coins are a way to dilute that share.

Other commenters have done a great job explaining how the transactions get confirmed or not.
It's also interesting to note what happens if you also control 51% of the mining power in the network:
Let's say transaction A get's confirmed in a block first. Whoever you sent the bitcoins sees it's been confirmed, and hands over whatever goods you were paying for: a suitcase of cash, whatever.
Let's say you get lucky, and when you fire up your miners (with power to eclipse the rest of the network), you find the very next block. Instead of building it off the most recent block (which confirmed transaction A) you build if off of the *previous* block, and confirm transaction B.
Now there is a fork in the blockchain, one branch with transaction A, and one with transaction B. They're both exactly the same length, so you fire your mining rigs up to full blast. At this point you're in a race with the rest of the network to make sure that the B-chain grows faster than the A-chain. That's why the 51% matters. If you have 51% of the power, you will win this race.
As soon as you can get the B-chain to be longer than the A-chain, transaction A is essentially "unconfirmed". Now whoever received transaction B will see that it's confirmed and hand over *their* suitcase of cash. 
Voila, two suitcases of cash.
There are a few loose ends though:
 - Generally, if you're transferring large amounts of money, you're going to wait for more than one confirmation. The more confirmations on transaction A, the further behind the B-chain will have to start, and you'll need more computing power or more time to catch up.
 - In the event that miners notice one transaction get confirmed several times, and then a new blockchain forms from way back, that's going to look really obviously suspicious. There's a good chance that miners, bitcoin clients, etc will refuse to switch over to the B-chain, even if it's longer, because it's obviously fraudulent. Especially when news of the suitcases of cash gets out. This would cause a true split it the network, where a transaction might be confirmed by one node but not another.
 - If you are a mining pool operator and you pull this shit, you can expect pretty much all of your users to abandon ship.
 - The cost of doing this is in the billions of dollars. And that's not an investment, that's money that will literally go up in waste heat. So it's unlikely that it'd make financial sense to do it. 
 - It's more likely that it'd happen via hacking. But the problem is you need to *sustain* the mining power long enough to race in front of the A-chain. And if you hack a mining pool, someone will notice and shut it down, and then the B-chain will wither and die.

The blockchain will fork, we'll all talk about it for a week and Slush/Gavin will become a footnote on 
The only reason Gavin was able to move quickly during the fork was because he was making sensible calls. If he was trying to do something nefarious, miners would have stayed on the 0.9 branch.

The difference between what's happening now with Bitcoin and what happened with PayPal/E-Gold is that the Bitcoin train has already left the station. 
If the US, or the EU, or anyone tries to regulate Bitcoin infrastructure startups tightly in their country, it won't *stop* those services from existing. They will just pop up in Russia or Israel or Turkey or Japan or China or Iran or South Africa. I can't say where they will turn up, but they *will* turn up.
And at that point these regulations become a competitive disadvantage for the countries that enact them. The cost of business for U.S. corporations will go up relative to less regulated countries.  It'll be costlier to send money overseas. And instead of having new Facebook-scale bitcoin startups in Silicon Valley paying federal and state income taxes, they will be somewhere else.

What happens if I run onto your property and murder your children and then run back onto mine?


OK, but resources (water, air, animals) have a habit of wandering. What happens when your lead leeches into my water supply?
And what about babies? Do they get any property, or they just get whatever scraps people give them? The great cruelty of property to me seems to be that children are born with nothing into a world where perhaps no one is willing to carve off even a little bit for them to get started with. Resources beget resources so that is a very unfair reality. I don't believe children are ethically responsible for their parents' crimes, nor do I think they ethically inherit their parents' triumphs.

Does the notion of perpetual deflation strike anyone else as completely absurd? The idea that investors would just stand by while a commodity grows predictably decade after decade just strikes me as utterly hilarious.
The market can, and will, put a price EVERYTHING it can. Including deflation. That's what markets do.
Timothy Lee [explains it in lay terms]( over at Forbes.
Bitcoin is not deflating. It's moving as global understand of its prospects change. As soon as there is something of a consensus in the financial world about what drives Bitcoin use, the price will stabilize.
Not stabilize and grow, stabilize. Like [Microsoft over the last 10 years](

It's not just the Overton window. I suspect they actually don't give a shit about catching flies. What they seek is healing through solidarity. They want to sit around and share horror stories about how shitty the flies are. The purpose is bonding amongst feminists, not conversion of non-feminists.
But as is customary, men tend to think that everything is about them.

You ask how it would be possible for Bitcoin to become the currency for Cyprus, so I'll answer directly:
It's made more complicated with the Euro, so let's pretend for now that they are still on the Cypriot Pound.
Cyprus would purchase some number of Bitcoins, let's say 25,000 of them. That would cost somewhere north of $3M, pocket change for them. Cyprus then sends all of those Bitcoins  to one address.
Next, Cyprus publishes that address and declares that all outstanding Cypriot Pounds are hereby redeemable for Bitcoins that they will draw from that address. And all Bitcoins drawn from that address will be redeemable for Cypriot Pound notes from the bank. Cyprus' GDP is about $25B, so each of those Bitcoins would essentially be a $1M note. A Satoshi would be worth about a penny.
Now anyone with cash can go on spending it like normal, but they can also "deposit" it with the government and get CyprioBitcoins back.  These CyprioBitcoins (the specific coins that came through the Cyprus government), since they have a much higher value than vanilla Bitcoins, would trade separately on exchanges. Your 0.0001 CyprioBitcoin would be worth about 1 BTC.
This may sound familiar. It's the Colored Coin concept:

Bitcoin is tangible, it's just small. When people say "I can't hold it in my hand" what they really mean is "I don't understand what I'm holding when I hold it in my hand."
If you understand how computers work, you understand that everything is physical and that there are real, physical structures that govern Bitcoins.

Let's say you buy a 50 gh/s miner from BFL today for 20BTC, you receive it September 1st and difficulty has doubled by then. You'd be earning something like 2 BTC/wk. That's a substantially better return than the ASICMINER share.
I'm not saying that's a likely outcome, but its not impossible, given many people are cancelling preorders, BFL is actually shipping, and the hashrate seems to be (at this moment) settling into a linear (if a bit steeper) growth curve.

Yeah, I love testing. It makes development immensely more fun and less stressful. That said, even after several years of TDD I still find it very difficult to write non-brittle tests. I frequently end up in "testing hell" where my test suite is just massively not suited to what I think the refactoring should be.
Probably I should just get used to the idea of spending a large percentage (20+%) of my time refactoring tests. But it just feels shitty. I end up instead trying to understand how to write better code and write better tests so that they're scoped right in the first place. But I'm just not there yet.

If I installed a keylogger on your computer and got your Mt.Gox password, typed into into Mt.Gox and withdrew your funds, the password system is working as intended, but I would still consider you "hacked".
I would say a system that works as intended but doesn't succeed at securing what it's trying to secure has indeed been hacked.

Do you think it's hard to switch mining pools? Do you think miners aren't reading an Bitccointalk all day? If a pool tries o pull shenanigans, miners will know it, and vote with their mining
The reason people use Gox is because it misty works and had never had a hack that affected account balances. If Gox goes pear-shaped, yeah it will affect the price, temporarily, as people move to other exchanges, but Gox has absolutely NO power over the sanctity of the network and the proocol.

I just used them to move some money from my Dwolla to Mt. Gox too, and it worked great. Not sure how long it took because I thought they were going to deposit BTC but they deposited USD, and I didn't notice that until a few hours after the transaction, but I think the transfer was instantaneous.

Paying your taxes is not a problem. Technically, if you owe income taxes you're supposed to send them to the IRS *as you go* anyway. So, as you earn BTC just convert whatever percent you owe to dollars at the asking price at that moment and send them to the IRS. Then come April you're all good, no matter what the Bitcoins are worth.
If you make any capital gains/losses from changes in BTC price between when you're paid and when you have to pay your taxes, you can just pay that at tax time. If you made gains, you'll have BTC to pay for the tax. If you had losses you won't owe anything. Either way you don't owe the government until you convert the BTC back into dollars, or spend them.

You're right for an individual block, but miners can look at the overall rate of transactions and calculate the minimum fee for them to hit their own profit needs and refuse to include transactions below that amount to try to put pressure on users.
It's kind of a tragedy of the commons situation though... someone could just grab those fees in the next block and you're sort of screwed.

As someone who pre-ordered an ASIC miner at $150, this pleases me. It would be nice if it would hold out until I get paid ~~and my MtGox account is verified~~ so I could buy back into my position at a lower price.

It doesn't matter how far into the future that gets pushed. It will be priced according to the return horizon of the aggregate investors. If the median investor wants money to spend 20 years from now, that's how far into the future they need to predict, and that's how far they will predict.


I agree with you 100%.
There is consensus amongst a small group that the price target is &gt; $100. People who understand the intrinsic value is the float of all the transactions that Bitcoin is uniquely suited to + probability of stabilizing * value as a store of value if it does). I suspect that target will be somewhere between $3k and $1M (0.01% - 33% of GWP), but that's another discussion.  As more and more people join in that consensus, and that target range narrows, the price will continue to rise until there are enough people in the consensus with enough wealth to hit the target, and the target is narrow enough that price stays fairly constant even as people within the consensus shift their position from bullish to bearish.
At that point, we will have a good indicator of the fundamentals (how many new person-to-person transfers are added per month, how many new purchases of goods, how many people are shifting their savings into BTC) and we'll have a good bead on what the adoption curve looks like.
Once there is global consensus about that curve (hashed out amongst traders on the exchanges) then the price will basically be fixed.
Now, there will still be political events, shifts in the Gross Bitcoin Product, etc... things that all currencies experience. But that will just introduce variance. I don't believe the price will be driven up due to the fixed supply at that point.
@_date: 2013-04-26 19:05:15
OK, so you don't think there will be long term deflation, you're suggesting the price will oscillate?
