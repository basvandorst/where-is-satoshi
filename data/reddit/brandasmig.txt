You can't see current exchange rate in that terminal :-)
I tested this system when it just appeared(about half year ago) and how it work:
1. You enter money in terminal
2. Terminal gives you bill with "secret" number
3. Then you should open website  and enter your bitcoin wallet number and "secret" number from bill
4. Wait for bitcoins
User can buy bitcoins with VISA card from their site. But looking at their exchange rate I don't know who is using it.

Same price you can pay for bitcoins without terminals for that company. In their website user can buy bitcoins with VISA card, and exchange rate will be the same - about 285$ for 1 coin. I verified that terminal today and add few photos in comments for subject post.

I bought some coins and add photos in comment. Rate is 286,95 USD for 1 coin. It's about 19,5% premium =)

You pay money and recieve bill with "secret number". At home you should open web site  , enter your bitcoin wallet number and "secret" number from bill and they will send you bitcoins. But they have very unsavory exchange rate(now it's about 260$, while in world it's about 230$)

In that "ATM" you can only "buy" bitcoins. But actually they are using terminals only for receiving money from you and give you bill that you should activate in their website -  In that website user also can buy bitcoins with VISA card and sell their bitcoins. But exchange rate here so unsavory that I don't undestand who will use it.

Just checked iBox and made some photos =)
I spend 50 UAH + 1 UAH for terminal fee (~2.4USD in total). So I convert 50 UAH to 8.3 mBTC with exchange rate 6041.77 UAH to 1 BTC (286,95 USD for 1 coin). Same way I can buy coins in their website with my VISA card. There is no 17% 'fee' for using terminal, you just bought coins with very bad price =)
