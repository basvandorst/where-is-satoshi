You won't be able to withdraw your BTC from cryptsy. You should have gone for a cold wallet. How much have you got on there?
BTC is safest in a safe. Not coinbase and certainly not cryptsy.

I don't really care about Bitcoin, really, as my focus is on several altcoins with more future...
@_date: 2014-02-21 20:43:27
I have gotten into my (never used) account, but don't want to risk money on them. Shame they never started with alternative currencies... on other exchanges, those transactions are almost instant.
@_date: 2014-03-06 01:26:51
One answer. Paper wallets. If you want to get out of the digital security because you don't trust it, you make a paper wallet and put it in a place you think is safe. It could even be a bank...

Still not integrating LTC is what made me wary of Mtgox, their communication about it was not being specific about it at best. At the time it seemed they really wanted to ignore Litecoin. Maybe personal issues via connections with the developer of Litecoin? Just speculating here.
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:07:33
Only the ones that took the chance to invest at Mtgox will be benefitting in the short term.
I must say, I think in the long term the price will go up. But the outcome of Mtgox will make the pace of the recovery.
@_date: 2014-12-03 23:59:44
They do provide an answer nobody of the Bitcoin devs is giving to the decentralisation issue...
I chose those coins I personally favor over those hundred of other coins that I agree are shitcoins. But try to see what drives the price right now. I've been a hodler from the beginning of 2013, both in Bitcoin and alt. But Bitcoin is really losing my favor because of this ASIC companies going solo issue.
@_date: 2014-04-23 11:07:30
And yet, if we could make devices with built in mining, but for heat generation... it would decentralize and ordinary people can heat their house/water with computations.
@_date: 2014-12-02 15:00:50
If you look at it long term, cryptocurrency networks in general need to be decentralized. If one player or a couple get the upper hand in computational power, they will be the target of attacks on the networks. See ik like a swarm of machines. If all machines would pack together in 1 or a couple of buildings they will be easy targets. Decentralisation is swarm logic:you can take out some targets, but the network as a whole won't be affected. So ideally everyone should have one miner at home, providing heat and cryptocurrency. In reality not everyone's that technical or has the investment power.
I hope I informed you on this issue. Because it will become a big problem if everyone just lets those companies break network stability. I see this becoming an issue in the coming year for Bitcoin in particular (as the altcoins favor decentralized mining in their programming). I hope some Bitcoin programmer will look at multi algo mining for example to adress this.
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:27:43
Where is it illegal? Maybe inside the building of any big bank?
@_date: 2014-06-14 09:51:22
And that's the problem with a centralized network, once the servers have to be maintained, every transaction has to wait for the network to get online.
@_date: 2014-02-24 09:36:10
Yeah I've been waiting for LTC implementation since summer, but they seem to keep people waiting for all their promises.
@_date: 2014-12-08 22:14:33
Many people oversee the decentralisation requirement that Satochi points out in his white paper. Bitcoin is still pretty centralized and the network is becoming weaker if it doesn't decentralize with it's growth in computational power. Being under 51% with 1 pool is not enough. It should be more divided by incentive. But I don't really have a solution for that (except go multi-algo or something else).
It's in my opinion the biggest threat to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:47:40
On Mtgox the price will go up after this gets sorted out, but the other exchanges will suffer the downtrend for a while. I think it will be levelled in a week or so.
But if they don't make it... the price on the others will go up in a breath :)
@_date: 2014-12-02 11:58:32
Seems like ROI is pretty important to you. Ever thought about the fact that cloud mining centralizes the network and thus making it weaker and worth less in the end. What those companys are doing isn't good for Bitcoin in the long run, it might even kill it.
But hey, it's only ROI and profit that counts, right? So you can have your precious fiat Dollars to spend on useless stuff.
@_date: 2014-10-03 21:26:48
And there's the biggest argument to decentralisation: Why have big server rooms that need to be cooled when you can have houses (or water) heated by computation? Way more efficient than a heater based on a resistor coil or other solutions.
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:12:59
I hope so, it would be the best for Bitcoin at the moment.
@_date: 2014-12-03 23:32:37
The secret question about centralisation, it isn't funny, really.
@_date: 2014-05-11 19:20:07
My theory is that this is the reason China doesn't want Bitcoin (yet). They first have to cash in on all the borrowed dollars they still have.
@_date: 2014-04-18 13:23:45
But the Bitcoin qt wallet can be safe right? (when backed up and encrypted)
@_date: 2014-04-23 11:04:48
Not that much effect yet. And if Bitcoin would disappear, another coin would take his place. So it wouldn't be cryptocurrency generally in trouble, but only the coins with the same vulnerabilities.
@_date: 2014-04-21 15:13:02
Bluetooth makes a connection software wise between devices. It's prone to vulnerability attacks.
QR codes don't have this problem. Only people changing the QR to another adress or malicious site could give issues. But those are real life.
@_date: 2014-12-03 23:29:28
Nobody sees the centralisation coming for the Bitcoin network and the problems it will cause? I'm an ASIC miner myself, following the industry closely and seeing a shift to cloud mining and big mining facilities. This will cause problems if you know about the concept of Bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-02-20 22:25:08
Their front page doesn't even hint at a real problem, and I guess the problem is Mtgox has a hidden agenda (not that I have seen any real agenda from them :).
@_date: 2014-06-14 10:32:14
Then it's only a matter of ghash getting hacked or the owner(s) being forced into stuff. So the network depends on their security, pretty centralized if you ask me.
@_date: 2014-01-19 21:15:17
Because you pay takeaway.com, and they pay fiat money to the restaurant owner. Takeaway.com uses bitpay for their bitcoin transactions.

Anybody on Mtgox selling BTC right would be mad or desperate...
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:44:21
Yeah they get out of there but the price has been lower than other exchanges for a while now. I think a lot of them will want their fiat (back) to pay mortgages or investments.
@_date: 2014-12-03 23:19:53
They do react to the centralisation problem witch Bitcoin is facing right now. It's like an elephant in the room.
@_date: 2014-12-02 22:14:43
If you have a local community you can always create your own pool, and p2pool mining is the really decentralized version (although there still is a server, but you can failsafe with alternatives).

People that trade on exchanges should know about other people's experiences on the exchange. I lurk a lot on cryptocurrency sites and Mtgox have been promising LTC integration for some time now. Payout delays are common for some time now (also on cryptsy). Communication is bad when u want support for some time now.
All this I only read on the interwebz, but a warned man is worth 2, as we always say.
@_date: 2014-04-12 09:15:51
That doesn't cope with the Bitcoin way of decentralisation. Those data centers *centralise* the power of the network to clusters, with more impact on the network when they get in trouble.

Bluetooth in itself can be used for data transfer. Maybe you mean NFC? That would be a better solution, regarding the range also.
@_date: 2014-12-03 22:32:13
If you look at the pool issue, there should be safeguards, but big mining farms are a bigger issue in my opinion. It makes the network vulnerable. Cloud mining is a part of the problem.
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:00:15
1: People (the members) will do everything to get their money back.
2: You can limit withdrawals, it will make the levelling of exchange prices go slower. It will make a delay on Bitcoin price evolution.
3: I don't think the bitcoins are gone. Other exchanges admit to some Bitcoins being in a crysis (held hostage) right now, and I think the lower price is a sign that it could get worse.
4: We need regulation in some way. If people invest money in something, the company should be held accountable for it's customers. I have never seen Mtgox give any clear statements or promises for LTC, same as now with the Bitcoin issue.
@_date: 2015-05-27 11:02:36

If the infrastructure is set, private companys with terminals, merchant api and easy currency conversion, nothing can stop a country from using crypto.
But for a government it's not easy to convert the debts they have to crypto. They would need bitcoin investors that would lend them the money (to get a negative account in bitcoins).

100% of energy input gets converted to heat.
@_date: 2015-05-05 14:23:08
Computers in general generate 100% heat from their electricity input. The movement of the blades gets air moving, but the energy required for that is minimal and also eventually results in heat (by conversion of the sound and kinetic energy in the air to heat by friction with other air and objects).
Look at a radio for example. It also generates 100% heat. It doesn't matter it makes sounds, this energy gets converted to heat also.

I cannot predict the future of Bitcoin in the short term (weeks or even months) but in the long term I personally think I'm right. All those companys will have to hold Bitcoin and price will soar (and that's only when the economy gets better, more profit so more margin to invest in crypto). It's not what they're doing most of the time right now.

@_date: 2015-01-13 17:38:28
Maybe then my message will get some ears here: I personally think the Bitcoin price will stay low until the big for-profit-miners are pushed out because of too high costs.
This would be the most logical and safe prediction (no time or price) in my opinion. Redistribution of computing power (and a massive sell-off of ASIC hardware) will result in more people holding less. But still, they won't insta-sell like nowadays.
@_date: 2015-01-02 23:56:00

@_date: 2015-01-04 12:57:47
That autoselling will continue for big ASIC miners as long as they are going for ROI. Bitcoin price is under pressure because more people want to sell Bitcoins than there are buying. Electricity costs have to be paid so that's the bare minimum to sell as you mine. I personally think most miners keep just 5 to 10 % of their currency.
@_date: 2015-01-03 14:32:58
Maybe a bit confusing but Hashcoin has to do with GAW while Hashcoins is an Estonian company.

@_date: 2015-01-04 19:43:49
I personally think many enterprise miners will stop mining before the price will go up. But you can also see it as a good thing, it evens out the playing field with more decentralisation and more spreading of the coin.

Yeah you may think it's meaningless but I'm a (small scale) miner myself, so I know how much money such an operation can cost. I personally hold al my mined crypto but that's because I can. I have solar and a job/financial reserve. But should I scale this bigger, I would know where all the costs are going to be, leaving me with not that much Bitcoin left. I would be forced to sell all but maybe 5 to 10%. OP gave the global numbers, but it gives the same message. Adaption will have to grow for Bitcoin price to go up, and that is my conclusion.
@_date: 2015-05-09 19:23:14
It seems pretty random, too. Some people have done business several times with crypto currency companies. Suddenly they get a letter from their bank.

@_date: 2014-10-02 18:11:06
Yes, for average Joe who wants his ROI in time because he doesn't have a reserve in money and has to sell the coins he mined.

The consensus in the Bitcoin network is in the hands of full wallets and nodes. If developers bring updates that people don't want (eg larger block size or more coins generated), they just don't update their software and the rules of the game stay the same. Both Ripple and Stellar can do whatever they want with their coin.

Care to think about why? The only solution for getting the price up is getting demand for it. You are promoting a scamcoin with your store, duping others or giving people who already are duped a chance to promote it even more. I will do what I can to point this out in the future.
No offense, but you better change this.

What did you order? Paycoin is a scam but this site isn't.
@_date: 2015-03-15 13:37:17
But it promotes Paycoin as a popular altcoin, while it isn't. Much dissatisfied holders and people right now seeing this and thinking that Paycoin is legit. No Amazon or Walmart payment option yet? Because they lied.

Both "infected" and target computer has to have specialized software to be able to do this. They just have proven that communication between 2 computers via heat emission and sensing is possible.

It's a bit too sensationalized to be ignored, that's why I reacted.
@_date: 2015-03-15 17:04:46
I'm not saying you are scamming, but you are promoting a scam. If in the description of the paycoin products you sell, there is a warning that paycoin is a scam or dead, it would change the whole situation.
You don't see the point? I will ask other redditors if they see it (and your site will get more views).

Bitpay isn't the only one:

Most businesses (officially) don't take this kind of money where I live, not even the 200 version.

It was invented in 2009...
@_date: 2015-03-15 17:16:37
Yeah, but everyone knows Seahawks lost. Paycoin hasn't gotten the official stamp of scam, that's the difference.
You can still sell MtGox merchandise, and it's not promoting them, because it doesn't exist anymore.

btcQuick is not operating and it has been decided that the company will be dissolved and the remaining funds will be returned to the investors. 
We decided that this would be the best option in light of our new merchant account being a complete joke, ACH payments are extremely fraud prone, U.S. regulation ,and our bank account has been put on hold. Due to the Credit card and ACH chargeback windows we will have to wait 6-12 months before we can return the funds back to the investors.
I will issue an official memo in the coming week along with a current assets report/listing.
Thank you for your support,

No, I mined with cpu, and because it was weeks to get a Bitcoin mined, I figured it was not worth it. So I started the Boinc client again to donate my cpu cycles to science (World Community Grid).

Talking about scams, why is paycoin so visible on the cryptochips site?
@_date: 2015-03-15 21:24:17
I'm glad you understand it's nothing personal.
You are right it's a philosophical thing. But also ethically wrong in my opinion. I hope you have a change of heart soon, because when this Paycoin thing explodes like MtGox did, you could be seen as a promotor (and maybe in on the scam, no direct accusation from me). I personally hate witch hunts. It's for your own good I tell you this (and you have been warned by others).
@_date: 2015-03-15 16:25:59
I've been following the crypto world very closely, and I've only lost a few Dogecoins at a mining pool that went offline. Almost every website where they ask you to invest money, turns out to be a scam. Ripple has something similar going, and that's why I stay far away from premined coins in general. They start centralisation at the point you are dependent on their website to be online, otherwise working with it gets too difficult. So please stop promoting the scamcoin. Others will lose money just as you did.

It makes Bitcoin a more clunky program than it already is. Wait even longer for sync and it is already longest of all CTC. No good idea in my opinion. But for a programmer's perspective I fear it's the only solution. They also could get rid of the first part of the blockchain so wallet users don't have to download it and it will relieve the qt wallet download for newcomers for a while.
@_date: 2015-02-09 22:20:56
The programmers could decide to get rid of tha first xxxx blocks of the chain to avoid the massive download people right now are facing when first using the qt wallet.
@_date: 2015-02-22 19:21:49
Yeah I seem to be having the same problem. I know a lot of people, even techies, but the one guy that even showed interest mumbled something about making a new, better coin on his own. He knows it's there and what it can do, but doesn't see Bitcoin or even altcoins becoming the cryptocurrency of the future.
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:43:19
What did you mean by the IN THE CHAIN comment then? It implies sidechains to me because that's the principle of the blockchain. Or am I wrong?
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:23:06
I personally find the block size getting too large and a 20 MB blocksize will only add to the problem. The argument that hard drive space is cheap is no argument. Don't expect new users with a hard drive that's already stuffed to buy another just for the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-02-09 22:37:03
No, It's off-chain just like you replied to my side chain answer. Once the site goes offline and you can't access your account, it becomes a problem, especially when the owners syphon all the money to another adress. Or has Changetip a backdoor when that happens?
@_date: 2015-02-09 23:00:53
Update me on that... I don't know what decision you mean.
@_date: 2015-02-24 19:50:07
I think this article will give more insight into this matter. They even emailed people on their mailing list a few days ago to say them monarchs are in stock.

Dear yakpimp, if you want to adress scammers, why not remove the paycoin stickers from your site?
@_date: 2015-02-09 22:23:06
The low transactions and long time per block make it in my opinion too slow for going to the supermarket, for example.
@_date: 2015-02-09 22:44:34
But I think the community should collide and get a concensus on what coin to use where. Now every coin has its haters and fanboys and it's not really helping in getting a good message to the public. 
News media shouldn't be trusted. People with knowledge and understanding should lead the way to a neutral view of the current situation. Many coins are bound to die eventually, but I think more coins will survive these early years than anyone could imagine.
And I'm looking at Dogecoin, ofcourse :)
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:24:26
Sidechains create different bitcoins and that's not really wanted. You cannot send Bitcoins to a wallet on a different chain.
@_date: 2015-02-09 22:33:58
I'm not trying to force anything. Merchants force Bitcoin in this position just because it's not designed for the massive scale consumption transactions. Sure, most of them will use Bitpay but it gives the impression Bitcoin will be the next payment ledger but it won't. And in the long term I doubt the CTC that will meet the criteria does not exist yet. The current system of payment and transaction is too complicated for 1 coin to manage and the community has to face this reality and act accordingly by informing the public. Now it seems like most of us are in a rat race of ROI and profit.
@_date: 2015-02-09 22:25:39
Bitcoin isn't about miners, it's about consumers and their impressions first using Bitcoin. Miners are exchange addicts that don't really see the problem (and I'm a miner myself but I hodl ;)

In contrast to the banking system, cryptocurrency as a system (open source code) has no secrets. All the info can be found on the internet, albeit sometimes not that easy.

I pay no tax on crypto so double of nothing is...

I think he meant Bitcoin won't be a relevant currency for daily payments in stores etc. The protocol is already being adapted in many innovative cryptocurrencies and I personally think there will be room for many different coins. Decentralisation in my opinion is also not relying on 1 blockchain, because when it breaks, everyone will have a problem.
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:48:33
I personally run a node because I have the bandwith available. People should be advised not to download the whole blockchain, and I think that isn't emphasized enough.
@_date: 2015-02-09 22:03:48
Problem is off-chain transactions aren't decentralized anymore, making the strong point of Bitcoin not that strong anymore. Whatever happens off-chain isn't in the Bitcoin concensus jurisdiction anymore and is in the power to whoever manages that adress.
That's the problem with trading right now. When you have much assets off-chain on an exchange, you have risk of losing it without ever being able to track wherever your money has gone (all money is in 1 or a few adresses I mean by that). Bitcoin is great for investment, but not scalable for world consumption.
Other CTC are in my opinion better, but I don't think any CTC can handle all transactions in the world. There will be room for many different currencies.
@_date: 2015-02-03 17:39:27
I've never seen someone say they got refunded more BTC than they paid for it, so I call bullshit.
@_date: 2015-02-09 22:50:18
Not with absolutely holding to the principles of Bitcoin: decentralisation to lessen control. If there's off-chain transactions, it's all up to the trust you give to the holder of the adress you sent money to. It's all up to you to secure your funds now if you have much. No Bitcoin company or website can guarantee anything. Most secure (and redundant) right now seems to be multiple copies of paper wallets in very secure places.
