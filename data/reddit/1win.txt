I was thinking of doing public address cards, hodl cards i guess. No real point, thinking of making them made to order for a couple sats. Just excited about the space as a whole, but I guess people could make them for themselves. Maybe something in stainless steel would be better. Idk. Thoughts?

I made this a little while ago but here is how to make a btc wallet yourself in python! this way you dont have to generate it online. stay safe peeps.
I started out with paper wallets for my btc when I first learned about how to store bitcoin. I made one on bitaddress.org, but the vulnerability of trusting a website to do it for you wasnt very reassuring. Neither is the fact you could be keylogged or the government sec spies could be watching you or xyz. Next best thing was a desktop wallet or a chrome app but I cant see the code so I didnt trust it and I wasnt about to buy a hardware wallet for something i wasn't sure about so there was no easy super secure in my gut feeling i know its safe way of storing my bitcoin. Well I recently learned some python and I want to share a way for you to verify the code, safely generate a wallet, and even have people on Reddit vet the process / code.
(I am on a windows computer so for reference, all instructions will be for windows computers, but the code should work for mac as well.)
To generate a bitcoin wallet you will need the following. 
*Python installed on your computer 
*The "bitcoin" python tools bitcoin library installed
Here is where you can install / how to install these. 
*Python 3.7.3 
Bitcoin (bitcoin module 1.1.42 
To install the bitcoin python module, open cmd after installing python, and enter the following:
"pip install bitcoin" 
Let this process finish.
After both of these are installed, right click on your desktop and create a new text document, and open it with text editor. Then copy and paste this code inside. (Feel free to read it, it comes with explanations as to what everything does). After that, name the document, change its appendage to .py and make sure to set it to .*all file types before you save.
    
    from tkinter import *
     is window module
    from bitcoin import *
     is bitcoin module 1.1.42 found on pypi
    
    Window = Tk()
    Window.geometry("259x100")
     window and sets size
    
    def button1_commmand():
        a = random_key()
        print("Btc private key: ", a)
        global b
        b = (a)
     1 generates random key locally using pip installed bitcoin module algorithm
    
    def button2_commmand():
        print("Chosen private key: ", b)
     2 sets chosen private key as one to generate other keys from
    
    def button3_command():
        global pubfrompriv
        pubfrompriv = privtopub(b)
        print("Public key from chosen private key: ", pubfrompriv)
     3 creates public key from private key
    
    def button4_command():
        addfrompub = pubtoaddr(pubfrompriv)
        print("Public address from generated public key:", addfrompub)
     4 creates address from public key from chosen private key
    
     in terminal for results
     follows is window &amp; button configs
    
    WindowMenu = Menu(Window)
    Window.config(menu=WindowMenu)
    
    topFrame = Frame(Window, width = 200, height = 25).grid(row=0, columnspan=3)
    bottomFrame = Frame(Window, width = 200, height = 25).grid(row=0, columnspan=3)
    
    button1 = Button(topFrame, text="Generate Private Key", fg="red", command = button1_commmand)
    button2 = Button(topFrame, text="Choose Private Key", fg="green", command = button2_commmand)
    button3 = Button(bottomFrame, text="Generate Public Key", fg="blue", command = button3_command)
    button4 = Button(bottomFrame, text="Generate Public Address", fg="black", command = button4_command)
    
    button1.grid(row=1)
    button2.grid(row=3)
    button3.grid(row=1, column= 2)
    button4.grid(row=3, column= 2)
    
    label_1 = Label(Window, text="Action 1")
    label_2 = Label(Window, text="Action 2")
    label_3 = Label(Window, text="Action 3")
    label_4 = Label(Window, text="Action 4")
    label_1.grid(row= 0, column=0)
    label_2.grid(row= 2, column=0)
    label_3.grid(row= 0, column=2)
    label_4.grid(row= 2, column=2)
    
    def quit(self):
        self.root.destroy()
    
    Window.mainloop()
     of this is button and window dimmension configs
    
     can input your private keys to  to test it out!
     sure to generate offline, and now you can be 1 step safer than generating it online or through a web wallet!
     sure you never share your private seed with anyone
Great job, now you have a python script generating you bitcoin private and public keys. All you have to do is double click on the .py file you just created and a cmd window will pop up, along with 4 buttons for you to click on. 
Make sure to generate them offline, hodl tight, and tell people about bitcoin.

Nah Bitcoin = Bitcoin, like how Doge = Doge, Litecoin = Litecoin. Otherwise call it Litecoin Core. Since Litecoin cash is also a thing.
