Lol yea when 1.5 bitcoin is equal to $5,000 
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:18:23
Buy and hold for a couple years. Simple as that. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:01:43
This is it folks this is why bitcoin is where it is. Simple and easy 
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:06:26
It broke very briefly about a week or so ago and it just shot back up no problem. So I wouldn’t look at that as a metric to gauge anything by
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:19:43
Well it’s not a rumor to those in SK... it’s a real life possibility. Looks like things are shaping up for the best tho
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:14:35
what rumor are you talking about?
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:19:21
All good! Hope the new year treats all of us well in the crypto world! Lots of excitement to follow I’m going to safely assume lol 
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:47:39
Yes they will lol 
@_date: 2018-01-28 14:06:09
“Imploded” confirmed in 9th grade. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:32:55
That explains the shit market. Are they reopening sign ups to new customers? 
@_date: 2018-01-15 09:43:44
Very possible 
@_date: 2018-01-23 02:33:59
I taught myself everything I know, you have to look for patterns. And just jump in and do it. We’ve all made mistakes and dumb moves. I nicknamed myself “Mr bottom”. I call bottoms like nobody’s business. Called the $10,050 bottom today for bitcoin. Bought back in with everything today and haven’t looked back. Patterns, the time of day, movements and behavior, watching the order books, it all has to come together for you to be a good trader. I only day trade when it tanks. It’s much easier that way when it’s on a massive downtrend. When it’s just peaks and valleys... don’t dare even try you’ll lose so much of your shit. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:48:44
Eventually that pattern will break lol
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:14:55
Believe it or not, that was t sarcasm, I was encouraging others to read your comment as it is spot on!
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:37:24
It might have come from the top, but it’s clear whether or wherever it came from is backing off and it will not be “banned”
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:31:28
No. DYOR. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:51:42
Huh? Why?? Thought it had reached a top and would be dumped? Was it on coinbase at the time? 
@_date: 2018-01-20 12:53:09
Ok my friend we get that tether exists. You don’t have any proof they are “printing it” so all you’re doing is spreading FUD right now
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:25:31
It climbed $2,500 in a couple hours... let it relax for a bit, it’ll keep climbing. I’m confident. If it were on a downward trend we’d be in the $10k range again. It’s $11,400 now. Once it hits $13k you can breathe again. Let it do its thing! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:30:29
You’re talking about a fork... I’m not aware of any planned forks of bitcoin anymore 
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:11:29
Low 14k I believe is a great price long term to invest. If you’re in it long term why take the chance it goes down to 12-13k or possibly even lower when there’s just as big a chance it touches 15-17k again before year end? Depending on how much you plan to buy, that $2-3k increase might be costly. And once the FOMO sets in, it’ll easily break 20k next year. Right? 
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:38:47
Just hold it lol I hold both but I got lucky and caught the big run up a few days ago with Ripple. I got in under a dollar and at $1.23  by selling bitcoin for it. But I still have some bitcoin. I believe it’ll recover. If it doesn’t I’ll sell it into something else 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:52:07
This bubble is just getting started... it’s got a year or more before you can be scared of things getting out of control. People still have no idea what this stuff is... 
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:40:21
Yea for two weeks then it’ll jump. It’s done this a number of times 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:24:58
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:35:32
No I’m merely saying that if you put in more than you were willing to never see again (a common rookie mistake), and you can’t live your life without checking the charts all day in an anxious fashion, selling is ok! Besides, at some point in bitcoins history, the shaky hands WILL get the last laugh. It just hasn’t happened yet. Just because bitcoin has always corrected doesn’t mean it will this time
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:27:38
You can’t... it’s all about intent. If your intent is to legitimately send money to your grandma...then of course you can do that. If it’s to avoid paying taxes... that’s called tax evasion lol doesn’t matter what you can or can’t do according to current laws. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:12:11
What are the Chances of success? What would have to happen for a short to occur and the price drop? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:08:52
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:27:16
Exacto-fucking-ly. Frankly this was insider trading at its worst and fucks everyone else over but those in the know. Not cool. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:22:26
Annnnd 13k! This feels different than last nights dead cat bounce. It’s longer and more sustained. Lots of menu that was sitting things out is coming back in now
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:32:17
Yes... like always... that’s why it’s just easier to diversity and just hold. One coin will spike then the other then the other etc etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:42:48
I don’t see it breaking through that for a while. It’ll hit 10k before it breaks back near 20k anytime soon
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:17:17
XRB can handle 7x transactions as XRP... I’m invested in both 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:22:49
$11,000 and $13,150 
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:56:55
If it hangs in the high 15k range all day today, I’d say 16k is imminent. But day to day it’s slowly climbing back up
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:46:05
Huh? Miss a word?
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:09:44
I adopted early as well. But anyone who bought over $15,000 up to $20,000 didn’t. And most out in wayyyy more than you or I initially did. Because who wants .002 of a coin anyways? It’s a psychological thing. People want a “whole” of something. And so they put in $1,000s of dollars to get as close as they reasonably could to a “whole coin” maybe with the intention to put more in later. And now their down 20% with no upside in sight. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:18:16
But to think the price going from $13.5-$16k is a “pump” enough to drive it down below $10k? Huh? That wouldn’t make sense. I can understand it bringing prices back to where they were yesterday but not below the lowest this thing corrected to last week...
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:56:22
I just don’t see that happening, it’d take some major event to trigger that. Not panic selling. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:11:12
What do you mean no liquidity? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:41:00
Keep spreading FUD 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:20:48
What makes you say that?
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:40:12
Just time time? Ripple is trading over $2 still. It only hit a high of $2.30 it’s within 10-15% of it now. Idk, as long as bitcoin stays down like this id just leave the money in Ripple. One is booming one is dead weight right now. Yes I know... buy low sell high and that’s what you did essentially, but give it some time don’t be like those people that sold their ripple when it spiked to $.87 last week or two ago. It’s showing no signs of slowing down, and it is behaving no differently than it did after it’s two recent spikes. It’ll spike up... dip... consolidate... slowly climb back to the ATH then spike again. We’re currently in the next consolidation around $2. I’m predicting a slow climb back up to $2.30 then another spike to $3. Or it could all fall back to $.20. Lol but the smart play imo was to just wait. As long as bitcoin is struggling your position hasn’t changed 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:48:46
You can wire money to both those exchanges and just send the coins to coinbase if youre so inclined to use their platform for trading. People are so scared to wire money IDK why.. its worth fees relative to what youd be purchasing and its also really easy and insured and can be traced and sent back by both ends. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:08:27
Anyone with 10 coins right now will be a millionaire in the next two years that’s my projection. No guarantees below 10 coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:02:51
Can you explain this to me lol I can never seem to understand this advice 
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:58:27
where can you buy XRB? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:37:51
Guys one day when this thing is $50,000 you all are going to WISH you had money in it now. Like today. This is the same exact shit I was staring at in September when it was $3,000 and not $13,000. It had just fallen 45% in value from $5,000. I looked at those $3,000 bitcoins like they were toxic waste. You couldn’t get me to put a dime into them.... that dip and this one... they are identi-fucking-cal. It hovered around $3,500-3,800 for weeks after the “dead cat bounce” to $4,150. Imagine looking at the prices fall again from $4,150 to $3,500 and how you might feel just when you thought it was all over. THATS WHERE WE ARE NOW. But it never quite got back down to $3,000 and and I don’t feel it’ll ever quite get back down to $10k as is the case now. And then it slowly just took off again after a month long recovery. This time next year... if you all hold on, you’ll be buying much more expensive Christmas presents in the form of cars or TVs for those with not a lot of coins lol Long story short: buy more or hold. Don’t sell. And only trade down if you know what you’re doing and good luck even then. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:54:30
I do feel like he is the one placing sell orders all day every day suppressing the price. Letting it rise... just enough then selling boat loads of bitcoin to tank the price. Sells on bad news makes it look like people are dumping. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:36:49
The value is in its utility. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:35:35
If it’s ever used in day to day transactions that 11k price the guy bought in at will seem like a drop in the bucket... he’ll be a millionaire 10x over. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:02:12
I actually changed my mind and bought in soon after this, traded enough to have made my buy in lower than this price. I remember myself making this comment everyday and thank my lucky stars I realized how stupid I was for thinking those things. And it was your comment that changed my mind. So thank you. One day if these investments ever pay off big I will send you some bitcoin I am serious. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:51:37
Yes this exactly 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:09:55
How?!!! Lol I want my .0000002 bitcoin gold lol
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:00:03
Coinbase charts say It went from $950-$1,000 ?? From Sat-Sun Dec 31- Jan 1....??? Maybe you should go look
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:12:09
Yes it is projected to rise to $100,000 a coin. I think if you believe in bitcoin that is what you have to believe it will do. Buy accordingly. It’ll come back... some say after the futures start trading 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:45:00
Alex Jones is a big fan of Monero. Fox News is talking positive about bitcoin.. And crypto currencies in general have an anti liberal, more libertarian political philosophy behind them. You won’t see a dem say “abolish the Fed” etc. So with all that Trump would be a supporter. Him supporting it is a good thing, but I don’t think he gives a rats ass about it frankly. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:30:08
Where do you people hide? Where were you when it was headed to $19k? Same people saying the SAME EXACT THINGS in all of those panic threads back in July and Sept. You guys must come out every time you smell blood just hoping this thing fails I swear 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:45:40
Where did you hear this news about BCH/bitcoin trading? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:54:07
I think anything below 15k is a good deal and up to that point you’ll make money... so $12k a coin leaves you $2-3,000 of growth. It’ll eventually pass $15k, but I’m predicting a dip at that number, so I don’t see a major pullback till then. Best thing is to wire your fiat to an exchange and just buy in with half and wait for a correction with the other half. That correction might not ever come though or it might come hard as fuck and the price drops to $5,000 again or lower. It’s just a way to play it safe because if it does tank hard you wanna be able to take advantage of that! I watched it dip from $11,800 to $8,500  last week... no fiat yet to buy and so I’m helpless to take advantage. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:56:17
Huh? I don’t see this rally fizzling out soon. People waking up or coming home will see it just jumped $3,000 In 2 hrs. And is climbing they’ll buy more 
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:20:35
Explain ..?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:41:06
Keep saying this... doesn’t make it true. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:42:32
It’s price manipulation... people trying to keep the price down  
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:07:26
See what? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:28:00
As I read your username... I regret not supporting Romney. Wish he had beat Obama... then we wouldn’t have Trump
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:27:36
It’s trading sideways all day. This is good. It’s consolidating around this price Mr. FUD. Back when it crashed in September it stayed at $3,700 for two weeks straight going down to low $3,500 then up to $4,000 and all in between. Finally it climbed back up to $4,000 and never looked back after that. If this was going to 10k again it would have already. It’s touched $16k twice. Some FUD last night killed the rally it was under, that’ll die out in due time and it will regain traction. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:45:12
Volume was very similar. I remember watching it then. Volume went wayyyyy up when it was falling then stabilized around 20k when it was slowly rising again. Very similar to now. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:00:58
Im willing to hear out your reasoning for this 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:13:06
Because it’s going to end up way down before all this is over. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:32:04
Huh? How old are you? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:58:10
The fact they’re cash settled is an even stronger argument for a short position... don’t actually have to own the commodity 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:06:19
People went head first into the mania phase last week and spent $1,000s of dollars on bitcoin near the ATH and are now deep in the red down anywhere 20%-30% from their investment ($19k-$14.5k). Losing $1,000 overnight is not an easy feeling for most. And in an asset this volatile, there no telling how much more they might lose or if they’ll ever get it back. So to say bitcoin will be $50,000 next year is pure speculation. Nobody knows. It could easily be back under $5,000 for all of next year and 2017 could be the “year of the bubble” just like 2013 was. It’s all up in the air. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:37:58
Don’t think they’ll ever add litecoin they are eth backers 
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:30:07
Not true. Ripple has a US dollar pair on bitstamp so when it goes up bitcoin value is irrelevant 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:34:42
But they don’t pay like that in other areas. Location is everything 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:37:40
Noticed that too! Bitstamp is higher than Coinbase LOL
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:17:19
Me too. This thing has had a lot of time now to tank. If it was going to happen it would be happening. A “slow bleed” or a dead cat bounce wouldn’t leave us with a $14.3k bitcoin at 7pm eastern today. This is the time of day this shit briefly runs upward (around 5-6pm eastern) then tanks (thanks Asia). What I think were seeing is a consolidation around $13.5-$14.5k similar to the consolidation after September’s crash when it consolidated around $3,700 for a couple weeks after falling from $5k to $3k. We had the same run up after each crash ($4,150 and $16,150). Eerily similar and it’s got me very bullish now. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:37:25
Who was that? Lmao
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:25:23
Yep. 10k here we come!
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:47:58
Here it comes. Back to the low $15k... 
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:32:11
It’s not a bad sign until more people do it. This is just a few people 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:13:35
Once it goes live again for buying and selling the price for Bcash is going to skyrocket again... don’t you think?
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:14:57
Don’t you think once Coinbase/GDAX allows buying and selling again the price will go back up to 8k? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:59:25
You have NOT MISSED OUT my friend... where do you think bitcoin will be in 5 years? Ten years? Over or under 13k? I’m gonna hey over lol 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:26:37
You might be right ! Just dropped from 17.5k to 16.5k
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:49:57
Action? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:44:53
Basing your purchasing decision in the 1 hr window today? Lol wat?
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:48:33
Dead cat bounce 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:55:35
News broke last night about Korea banning exchanges and everyone panicked. It lost the momentum it had built. There’s also an issue with exchanges not being able to verify new customers due to massive demand... I’m still holding 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:01:26
It’s already hit 20k lol
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:06:33
How do I buy it? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:45:24
No way it’s that high by Jan 31  lol you’re smoking crack
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:42:01
For now... it’ll dip back down to the 10k again
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:07:50
Barring any crazy news, it’s not gonna go lower than $13-15k now if you ask me, the time to have sold was yesterday at $17.5k. You missed your shot. Now is too risky you’ll lose guaranteed. Only way I’d ever sell here is if it legit crashed to like $5k. Then I’d bail and take what profits I’ve still got left 
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:31:14
End of Jan things should be up again 
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:34:36
It came back $.30 in like 20 mins. It was only worth $.30 just a couple months ago lol snows the time to buy more honestly 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:15:29
The fucking truth right here! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:09:01
No but it was the Ron Jeremy penis enlargement pills delivery confirmation. Fingers crossed they work!
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:04:34
It’s been under $17k for the last 2 weeks where were you then? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:50:08
Prob about 2-3 hrs 
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:58:00
but that volume isn't sustainable and is already over 20k
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:48:36
If it touches $15k again today idk if $12 is reachable again even with Christmas 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:05:45
It’s only $3,000 away from $10,000... it’s dipped $3,000 back when it hit $5,000 lol what makes you think it won’t drop that much again? I’m predicting a $5,000 drop back to $10,000 after it hits $15,000. No one knows for sure what’s going to happen, but I can tell you this with 100% certainty: bitcoin WILL drop again lol 
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:26:52
Well it just shot up to $15.6k now, so it’s done with the sideways movement in the last few hours of $15.1-15.4k. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:43:16
Not every house is over a million dollars though lol
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:39:55
It’s like someone with $100,000 now who decides to invest it right now at $10-11k telling everyone they became millionaires off of bitcoin when or if it hits $100,000 a coin in a few years as people speculate. Well they already had $100,000... to begin with... lol
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:19:04
They said they’ll enable that Jan 1
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:36:41
Wait... you expect it to dip down to 4k? After it hits 15k? I’m confused 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:11:13
Same here. I need a $377 litecoin price just to break even. FML that thing is not moving at all. Hopefully it climbs back up over $300 soon just to ease the stress.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:02:48
You should have already bought ! Like at $11-13 range!
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:31:29
I completely agree. However, I do see it above current prices before the end of the year. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:43:23
Above 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:11:09
Raiblocks didn’t flinch when bitcoin tanked this morning in fact it kept climbing 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:08:17
I sold and bought back in to the tune of losing $4,000 worth of coin... traded like a fucking savage and made it all back... whew. Also bought more on the way up. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:51:10
I think a lot of people are holding till $100,000 a coin. At that point, it’s gonna be too hard not to sell
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:33:28
Bitcoin and litecoin will both have their time again to pump. And Ripple will plateau. It’s all cyclical. Give it a couple weeks.

In the long run yes I feel like it is! But people who bought two days ago, broke my and many other golden rule: they were greedy when others were greedy. But it’s human nature!

I’m not the one talking out of my ass. Specifically trying to scare people
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:27:48
It’s prime time buying in the US... Friday evening. It was a hair under $18k 24hrs ago and went down to $13.5k 10hrs later early this morning. If it tops out at $16.5k tonight, and drops again, it could easily break $13k. From there it might not recover so fast and the shaky hands go down with it. After the futures launches in the next 10 days, expect to see some low numbers and just have money ready. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:57:15
It’s over 22k now.. and climbing. It’s the holidays man it’s low volume people are with family 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:18:04
I see all cryptos exploding in the next few years. Lots of people sold their bcash right as it hit and price tanked to $200. Few months later it went up to $2,800 and while its since fallen its still way higher than it was. I’ll hold on lol 
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:23:34
But the next dip is going to comer around 15k to maybe 11k where we’re at now... but maybe it doesn’t drop to 11k... maybe it goes to 17k back down to 12-13k.... either way, I’m waiting on my fiat to make it into gdax...as the price keeps climbing. So I hope it stays about where it is lol
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:10:12
Huh? It went from $700 to $5000... 700% increase in 6-7 months 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:23:43
Very possible
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:50:51
I hope so but I doubt it. Just hoping it stabilizes in the $14k range a bit 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:33:50
People will see the price drop because they’re going to look at how the futures values the price... hint: they’re not going to be betting on it hitting an ATH anytime in the near future after it’s in the middle of a downward spiral and right after a crazy 40% rally... it’s almost certain prices will drop so why would you bet they’re going to go up? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:25:58
It did this morning. I saw it. The prices on their charts aren’t accurate after a few hours. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:13:48
How much is bitcoin gold trading for?
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:35:32
Shit if it hits $1,000,000 then I’ll give him $1,000!! Lol 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:38:25
It’s going to get bloody, and a lot of people are going to read this comment and ignore it and regret it tomorrow and Tuesday into next week. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:51:17
He has no idea wtf he’s talking about 
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:18:53
Usuallydead cat bounces don’t level off for 24hrs. They peak then start to fall again 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:41:53
It’s almost like history repeating itself 
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:01:33
Once an ETF is greenlighted, you better hope you’re holding bitcoin at that time. Because that is when the price will become unattainable to own a whole coin in their lifetimes. $50,000-100,000 a coin wont be out of the question at that time. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:05:47
Haha same here 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:47:42
Amazon was a bubble also in the 90s. Bitcoin was a bubble in 2013. And in July of this year, Sept of this year, and October of this year, and also just now of this year lol In all but the very latter instances no matter how much you lost, you’d be a millionaire now if you had any significant holdings then. That’s why dead people are the best investors. Don’t panic sell and only trade when it’s tanking hard after a bigggggg run up like what we just had at 19k. And that’s if you have the balls to even do that. Diversify. And just forget you have money in this. As long as it’s your own money, and you don’t owe it to someone else and you can live comfortably and pay your bills without it put as much of it in as you want. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:06:27
Well I stand corrected.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:12:30
Can you explain what that means for the price of BCH? Is $4,300 the top you think?
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:13:18
Can you explain what a trading bot does and the purpose behind it? And what things you are lookin at to see what they are doing? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:43:46
Get back to me Tuesday when it’s 10k.. lol 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:47:27
It’ll probably drop back to where the rally started as these dips usually do... so I’m thinking $10-12k it’ll bottom out at. Any bad news hits in the next day or so, and I’d predict $8k 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:04:25
Always an exception 
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:12:04
So the real price of 1 bitcoin is $1,000? Is that what you’re saying?
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:42:34
People are selling to be able to pay their owed taxes is what I’m taking away from it. Like for instance I owe $5,000 in property taxes... I sell $5k of bitcoin to cover. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:45:24
This is my prediction. Such easy money to make by doing this. This run up is a mania. Be fearful when others are greedy.... be greedy when others are fearful. Time to buy long term...now is ok. But you will be at a loss for a period of time. Time to buy short term is next week. This cant keep growing $5,000 a day. Itll hit $100,000 by years end lol  
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:12:58
Right but that took time you can’t cash out right away
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:41:58
And rise and drop and rise. And anyone who doesn’t buy now In a year will be wishing they did
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:52:25
I remember comments like this when bitcoin was at $4,200 and had dropped from $4,900 and everyone was saying this is the dip... two weeks later bitcoin had touched $2,900 again. A 40% drop in price. As the price inches downward it will drag more and more recent buyers into the “oh shit it’s crashing better sell now” thoughts. And just because you say or I say that the price will come back, maybe it never does. That what anyone involved has to know. One day, those panic sellers who protect their initial investment will be looked at as very smart people. So none of this talk is fud. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:14:44
Seems to be hovering around 14k as the resistance 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:16:53
I got $5! Lmao sold it already 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:15:19
But that was 60 mins ago... lol you mean another 60 mins??
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:38:13
How do you know how many buys were posted? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:25:17
Which fork?
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:24:53
Not that this is a political thread or to turn it into one... but elections for either party come in cycles. Democrats popularity is due to rise very soon, just as it did in 2006-2010. It’s been 6-7 years since Dems were a popular party. They’re due again. And Republicans will be in the next ten years. And so on and so on lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:52:51
Not in the way they would short it.. you can always pull your funds out, but that’s not how they would do it, they would buy a contract and do it that way... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:07:33
It’ll either be below $10k next two weeks or over $20k lol flip a coin! 
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:06:16
Stop posting this in every thread it’s annoying and is off topic completely.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:56:36
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:53:19
Buy litecoin. Or invest in newer coins like SALT or even Ripple which isn’t newer but still has major potential. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:50:18
IOTA? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:31:09
This is a perfect TEXT BOOK example of a bull trap. This price still has a long ways to fall... people don’t realize that prices don’t fall in a day to their bottom, just like they don’t rise in a single day to their tops. Buying into These prices above $15k today will make people very nervous come Tuesday when it’s about to hit $10k again. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:19:09
For today....
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:40:28
What huge increase? That was this past week. That WAS the huge increase. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:31:43
Got a link for the lazy person like me?
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:14:44
I might just let it sit. At that price it’s really only way to go is up lol 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:47:32
He’s doing that because a lot of FuD spreaders here we’re hoping it would touch 12k today. That it is now a stones throw away from 14k again and Lilly to hit it later on tonight kind of kills that dream. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:35:26
Keep saying that I’ll keep making money while you do. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:10:51
Called it like 2 times today. People dismissed it 
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:19:01
Damn! He lost $5,000 in just 4-5 days...ouch!
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:18:47
I just went and bought some BCH at $3,500 hoping it skyrockets back to $9,000 again lol Also sold a small bit of bitcoin just to leverage my bets here because it always seems they move in opposite directions lol 
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:57:01
Why would coughing prices for bitcoin to rise have any effect on the fork? Do you think people are buying into bitcoin now just to get 2x coins? If that’s what you think is happening and you think that THAT is what will cause prices to fall below 10k you’re either dumb or spreading FUD
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:32:30
Different....yes, as worse as the situation when bitcoin dropped from 5k to 2.8k when China banned it? Not even close. If bitcoin can withstand that, it can withstand this no sweat. BCH has been around a long time and if it were to take marketshare away from bitcoin it wouldn't be dropping to $1,000 again soon. So yes it is different, but in the end, it wont matter how or why, and OPs advice still is good. BUY NOW. Once this thing gets its feet underneath it, itll be insane what prices it will reach. Don't believe me: then sell it all now and leave. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:32:18
It’s because he sees the price “trading” at $9,500 on gdax. That’s just a glitch or artificial spike from last night and isn’t the price it’s trading at 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:48:41
Its a store of value that’s its utility at the moment 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:22:53
You and I won’t be alive when that happens...
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:35:34
Wonder what that means?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:48:59
That’ll be tomorrow lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:06:32
Which helped me stay strong during this dip. Literally a carbon copy
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:01:52
You need to own XRB and XRP. I might get myself some IOTA also. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:51:14
It’ll dip hard again. But I’m predicting nothing major until 15k. If you wanna bet, that’s when a good time to short would be... I’m considering it
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:32:35
I traded my litecoin for Ripple yesterday. Fuck sitting in the red on that shit 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:27:34
I can almost taste the salty tears that will be flowing from your eyes here in the very near future once trading goes live on GDAX :)
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:48:31
Aside from the Mt Gox crash It was below $1,000 for years and only just in Jan jumped above it again. Then... it never looked back
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:23:53
Bcoin crash is still Bitcoins bitch. Bitcoin took a dive so did bcash...and even harder. It’s just an alt. Never will be more than that 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:31:54
People do NOT LISTEN TO THIS GUY HE IS SPREADING FUD he doesn’t know shit 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:12:19
It sure fucking is! Just ate through a 115 coin wall in seconds 12.5k! Cmon 13k! Lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:03:39
How did it help you? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:10:51
That must have been an ACH transfer . Those typically take that long. This was a same day wire. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:24:01
It hit it last night and went back up near $18k in mere hours. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:54:13
A 50% drop is pretty drastic... I don’t see that happening anytime soon IMO. And we just saw a drop from $19.7 to $12.7... that’s $7,000 lol that’s close to 40% in just a few days. It’s gonna hover below $20k for the rest of the year. But once it breaks past $20k.... watch the fuck out because $100,000 won’t be too far off
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:42:48
What do you mean don’t be fooled here? You think this upward movement is a fluke? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:46:16
It means big money is coming in and it’s coming in with a purpose other than to “HODL”.... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:26:57
Well it just dropped $3,000 in an hour lol 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:37:12
Mods are on the ball today
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:08:53
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:10:34
For what like $50? Lol go work an extra hour or two at your job lol
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:08:08
This is why I have my holding as follows: 20% bitcoin 40% litecoin 30% eth and 10% everything else. Bitcoin has issues but once they’re fixed it’ll take off again and I’ll adjust accordingly. If it doesn’t... well it’s not a huge loss and whatever else takes its place will more than make up for any losses. Gotta diversify!
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:28:01
Buying to short it no doubt
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:47:17
Yes hard
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:06:49
Where do you see these things? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:40:13
Just like anyone who wants to make a million... you’re not gonna get to that point anymore investing hundreds. It’s gonna take minimum $50k investment now to make a million in a few years if trends continue. Likely $100,000. So yea if you have $100,000 now to throw in, you have a shot at becoming a bitcoin millionaire. Or lose it all lol
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:49:02
It’s gonna go lower than that
@_date: 2017-12-30 02:31:38
Yep. We’re on week 2 now. I honestly believe mid Jan we’ll be well back in our way to 20k again 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:38:40
At $100,000 I sell everything. Alts like litecoin will be in the $5-10,000 range so I sell those off to. If it is a bubble, it’s just starting. Besides, what other commodity drops 30-40% regularly? It just went from $19k-13k in a matter of two days. I’ve said this before... but bitcoins ability to bounce back actually makes the bubble talk less scary. Because it’s my belief that if it is a bubble, it would recover after just a few months, maybe a couple years. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:39:29
In about an hour it’s gonna gonna be posts saying “dipping under $14k” lol there’s no way an asset can literally double in 2 days and not see a retraction of some sort. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:11:07
What price spill the beans lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:36:38
Well yes of course no one is saying that futures will keep the price low forever, but short term... not a good time to buy right now lol And if you have bigger balls than I do: it’s a great time to sell and get back in at a better price lol 
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:57:59
I cannot wait for that day!! Gonna buy in hard at that point. If it’s at $25,000 to $18,000 so be it lol or $50,000 to $25,000 oh well. At least I know I got in “low” 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:33:51
We’re not gonna see 10k again. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:46:49
He means in Jan 1 you’ll be able to trade bcash for bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:32:09
It’s $13.3k on bitstamp and $14.3 on coinbase wondering if I should send over half a coin from bitstamp to coinbase and mKe $500? Lol would that work?
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:31:31
No and I have no idea why the charts are like that. Lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:29:41
That’s why my .1 BCH hasn’t confirmed in Coinbase yet and is still pending... shit. That was stupid to try and send it over... that’s gonna be costly lol 
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:56:05
You just randomly said “this weekend” and pulled that out of your ass. You have no idea what it’ll do this weekend 
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:01:40
Actually it feels like it’s been slowly doing what it always does: crawl back up very slowly to the pervious ATH then blow by it... but I think this time the Korea news has people worried...so more cheap coins for people like us who are building a portfolio of this stuff with what little funds we have lol 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:46:26

If it can hit $4700... $5000 is gonna happen... idk when but I'm inclined to say soon 
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:28:52
Interesting can you explain? Who sets the price? Or what sets the price? 
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:03:30
From the perspective there hasn't been so many people looking to take down bitcoin...like yourself... yes I agree lol but that does not help your argument 
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:22:05
How about now? It's down $500 below the ath
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:03:26
Best concern troll I've ever seen. So subtle in your ways. GTFO
@_date: 2017-08-07 12:55:03
@_date: 2017-08-07 18:18:38
Right but it JUST hit $3,000. It hasn't been 50c in years
@_date: 2017-08-14 19:33:40
Never understood why to "sell the news"
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:10:22
Buy more at the bottom of this dip. When it gets back to $4,400... sell off what you bought yesterday. You're welcome.

Holy cow!

I just bought my first eth yesterday with the profits from my recent bitcoin purchase. Can you direct me to the eth discussions on here? I've made $40 already, I want to buy more but not without doing my homework more. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:45:27
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:13:53
How did you know to sell yesterday? What if it went to $6,000? How did you know yesterday was the "top"?
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:49:56
Listen, I don't have much stake in bitcoin. I put a few thousand of fun money into it, I've yet to lose a dime, even if it drops much lower. Point is, I'm responding to you in an objective manner. No one can say that scaling issues cause bitcoin to live or die. If that were true it wouldn't have doubled overnight AFTER NESCOIN came out. NES=8MB a reference to you know what. So for me, I'm seeing your logic, then looking at real world events which don't support you. And no: it'll prevail just like it always has. Whether with segwit2x or not. If segwit2x takes over, I'll own as much of that as I do now when it forks and it'll be the new dominant coin and that will go to moon as they say here. This is a golden time to be in crypto and we should all be putting in whatever fun money we can find and leaving it for the next decade. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:29:31
Yea and then skyrocket back up to $4500! lol 
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:45:06
Still don't get it! Lol
@_date: 2017-08-07 12:17:31
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:29:58
It's up $1,000 in a week... it took off lol 
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:07:34
I'm not certain of anything... that's why it's fun money. Congratulations on being blessed, it's a big part of why we're all here, so we can say that in 2025. I was just taking real world events, that bear a strong correlation to the argument you are making and using them to say "you're likely wrong". Scaling issues and altcloins with more features are not holding the price back. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 23:47:42
But bitcoin has gone up during every controversy. Why would the price be impacted here if this one exchange goes down? What is a tether btw? 
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:24:49
"I remember when bitcorn was $3,500" I wish I had bought more
@_date: 2017-08-14 13:22:19
Feels like it's breaking through now... thinking of placing another order 
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:12:39
It's here. Better buy
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:04:21
Possible Ripple could be like ETH? As in valued in the $100s? 
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:04:03
Why? Do you think this is the "top"
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:09:11
lol discount was last week at $3,250
@_date: 2017-08-12 23:12:36
Well it dipped today from $3,975 to $3,775... $200... how much of a dip are you waiting for? $1,000 $1,200? Those kinds of dips might not come for a while, at least that's my 2c. Remember just few years ago 2014-2016 bitcoin was only worth $200. Now in just 5 mins it can lose the entirety of its 2015~ value. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:59:42
Didn't he die?
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:37:21
Who?? Lol
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:08:36
3,800 now... 
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:37:49
Well if we ever do I'll be buying a ton lol
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:35:49
$3,650,000. Buy when it dips to $3,650.
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:10:21
It's never been phased before... that alt coin that has 8mb blocks... the one that just came out that everyone knew about, only caused bitcoin to go up $1,000 almost overnight. Scaling issues will be dealt with soon with segwit and lightning. End of year, transaction on bitcoin will be cheap and fast and the price will reflect 
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:26:39
This is EXACTLY what I did. I wanted to buy half a coin today but settled on a quarter coin. If it corrects, I'll go buy more, at a lower value or at the same value I bought in at... this time with the knowledge of where it can go ($3,800 as of today).

How do you move from BTC into eth?

I read the article but still don't quite understand how the hack was going to work
@_date: 2017-08-14 18:28:22
That's when I bought. When it crossed $3,550 after staying at $3,540~ all day, I knew something big was on the way. Hell, I knew something big was coming once it crossed $3,500. But I finally gave in and stopped waiting for it to "correct". Happy I did so. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 11:18:37
$3,825* lol
@_date: 2017-08-07 19:49:09
So it looks like the REAL chaos is still ahead when the 2x fork debate heats up later this year. Could be another good time to buy..?
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:43:02
It actually got up to $3,950! So close to $4k

@_date: 2017-08-14 17:51:11
I read the article but don't understand: are they saying bitcoin will fall to $3,000 and never go higher? Or is that the lowest they think it'll fall before rising again? 
@_date: 2017-08-12 00:36:28
Funny because this is/was the ATH ... good going 
@_date: 2017-08-22 03:19:09
Maybe The music will stop one day... but maybe when that day comes, it'll just stabilize in value. I don't see any losers or winners when that happens. No one  here is advocating putting your 401k into bitcoin or selling your real estate investments and throwing them in here. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 16:48:18

Finally a thread on some price discussion aside from that dead sticky 
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:33:06
What would drive it down to that price?
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:53:20
No they're not... 
@_date: 2017-08-12 01:36:39
If it ever hits $10,000... I'd try shorting it then... lol 
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:15:20
I'm still kicking myself over that! I watched it hit $1,800 and read a comment here that it would hit $1,200 or lower in the next week, 2 days later it went back to $2,800. Fuck me. But right now I do feel is a bad time to buy. It will come down again, even if it's only a small dip it will drop again.
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:24:12
Yes. But if you say it'll never be below $3,000 again, I think it will. And yes I realize I could have just bought some last week, but I didn't. But now I know where it can go. Those who buy now at the ATH will regret it because it will fall back. All those graphs you see when people post bitcoin prices, the are squiggly lines for a reason. It goes up, then down, then up higher. There will be another time to get into bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-07 12:16:20
Last time it was in this position I bought $500 worth at $2,800. Three days later it fell to $2,000. I am close to buying 1 whole bitcoin right now, but I just can't justify getting in at $3,300! It's not that I don't see long term potential, but I do see it going under $3,000 again sometime. It might be a while before it does but it will. It was briefly $1,800 just three weeks ago. I'm putting my chips into that bet: we will see sub $3,000 bitcoin again. That's when I'll buy. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:09:58

Bitcoin is to the internet as our ability to send money to anyone, anywhere is to a dial up modem. If you don't under stand this analogy... I can assume with some reasonable certainty your ACT OR SAT scores weren't very high.

You're just like the people that thought it would dip hard after Aug 1... LOL If a correction happens it'll be before or during Nov and after that if it recovers or never even dips at all or any sort of other good news/resistance by bitcoin... game over time to fly!

SAME HERE! I was eating lunch with the gf and was like "oh wow bitcoin crashed hard to $1,850" and it was only middle of July and the geniuses on this subreddit were all saying how it was likely to hit $1,200 or so as the "bottom". Two days later it was back to $2,800. But then i was still hopeful it would fall more so it kept waiting... bought some today juuuuuust before it took off. A small consultation lol
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:11:27
I have 5.85! Lol
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:15:22
I'm so tempted to buy right now, but I just can't at this price. If it never comes back down, oh well. But at $3,300 I'm not parting with that much cash to own a bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-08-21 02:14:19
Coinmama charges wayyyyyyy more $$$$ for their bitcoins than other exchanges. They'll sell a bitcoin for $4,550 when the price on gdax or coinbase is $4,250... their fees are crazy and also, they don't give you all the bitcoin you bought... by the time it's confirmed every time I buy my coins I don't have that much in USD EVEN AFTER paying the fees. My 2 satoshis.

Put it all in now. It’s gonna be 50k by June. You’ll be worth over a million dollars in six months. $10k is nothing. People will wish they could buy a bitcoin for $10k when it’s $50k or even $100k.

A lot of tax issues come from your “intent”. If the intent is to gift it to someone who then gives it back to you for the purpose of avoiding taxes, then that is a problem. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:33:57
No but it’s gonna have it’s ups and downs along the way. Have cash...lot of cash ready for when it corrects to buy in as close to a bottom as you feel comfortable. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:06:19

@_date: 2018-02-01 22:39:15
Maybe. So far that’s what it’s looking like but honestly at some point in time this thing isn’t going to go down again. Where that happens at is anyone’s guess. I’m waiting to see if it breaks past the $8,700 level again a lot of analysts predicted it would bounce off of. So like usual, thus could be another dead cat bounce or be the start of a new upward trend for months to come. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 19:27:35

And it lost in 18 seconds,,, bad sign. Headed to the $7,xxx now
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:25:07
I'm interested in this idea, can you go into more detail about why 6 hours after is just as good a time to buy as sometime before? 
@_date: 2017-09-16 13:11:55
How do you know this?
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:28:49
The goal is to purchase a ton at a low price then sell it when it gets high up in value. Then, when it falls again they buy back in but this time they get to buy way more, vastly increasing their position. Yes they ultimately want the value to go up, but they also want it to plummet as well. So I hate to break it to you, but the big players do bet against the market 
@_date: 2017-09-01 06:40:18
What happens then?

@_date: 2018-02-21 19:48:18
This is not healthy at all. The market behaving like this is not normal in any sense of the word. A 15% drop in under 24hrs? Not normal. This is planned and this is a “dump”. Last week or 10 days has been a pump. Expect to see the $9,000s again or lower 
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:22:47
This was how the last set of rumors started.. and what does JM know about what China will do in regards to Chinese mining of bitcoin? People relying on him for hard facts right now is now a good idea imo. I don't even think China knows what it is going to do lol 
@_date: 2017-09-02 21:45:41
Explain your reasoning 
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:38:27

@_date: 2017-09-03 01:07:26
Right I alluded to the fact that bitcoin blew past $4,000 in my post. It seems odd numbered $1,000s so far have been a barrier and even numbered $1,000s have been no issue. Yes I know that has no bearing on the future lol In any event, you are absolutely right I should have cashed out to fiat. I'm still new at using gdax and I wasn't sure how the fees would be in doIng that.  
@_date: 2017-09-09 18:14:38
If you have some balls and aren't afraid to lose few hundred on a whim you could make serious $$$. I have a system and I plan to stick to it. Right now is pure gambling to try shorting at any price. At $4,300 at $4,400 at $4,200 etc at any moment it could blow up again 
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:00:39
Last week or so bitcoin has shown better returns. That said, eth is up $50 since I bought one at $340, but I sold it to buy back into bitcoin, I just feel like it'll grow faster that way
@_date: 2017-09-08 16:54:00
Your image says $4,400
@_date: 2017-09-15 08:36:02
I'm waiting for news like that to buy back in. People look at the price to determine to buy or sell. I look at this forum news and rumors. Wish I had sold earlier.

This is likely where the bottom will be in the next crash. It’s going up and isn’t stopping anytime soon. Bitcoin will see new all time highs this year and sooner than we all think. I went in with half, I’ll go in with the rest if it when it has a sizable dip. I should just go all in now. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 19:34:38
Agreed. You guys will be the billionaire, we will be the millionaire lol 
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:45:57
It's literally the most volitle asset you could put money into at this point in time. Wait till later on in the year to buy in. After the segwit2x shit is over and the China shit is over. So beginning of Nov. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:38:10
So you still think it'll fall back to $3,000 again?

@_date: 2017-09-16 14:00:02

$4,200 for a bitcoin is absurd. Price needs to correct. Up $3,000+ in a year (over 400%) can’t be sustained. People are going to wake up one day and realize they own thousands of dollars worth of random numbers and letters they can’t do anything with, and it’s not gonna be pretty. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 23:40:33
It has. Seems the new floor is $4,500

Volume is way down. Everyone waiting lol
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:42:17
Basically let's say the guy who purchased 2 pizzas for 10,000 bitcoins put that amount on a credit card at the time of the purchase. So his debt for those two pizzas is 10,000 bitcoins in 2010 which was about $20. Let's say he set up an auto pay system that would pay off 200 bitcoins of it a month. By now in 2017, with 1 bitcoin being worth $4,500~, his debt went from $20 worth of bitcoin in 2009, to $45,000,000 in just 8 years. Now this is a moot point if the individual in this example was still eating 1,000s of bitcoins in the early days and held onto them and is currently a billionaire in fiat. Lol 
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:52:44
Litecoin seems to be worth more relative to bitcoin since the last "dip". At $4,500 litecoin was $74 and now at $4,400 litecoin is holding at $75 on average.

I've never tried to short bitcoin. Never fucking will. It's too risky the way it goes up. It's a PURE guessing game as to what is the "top". However, buying the "bottom" is a little easier IMO

@_date: 2017-09-08 15:29:55
I bought into litecoin the last time it dipped. Any litecoin in the $60 range in my opinion in one year is gonna pay off big. The ATH is almost $100 for 1. That's on average "$30 off" savings to use this subreddits meme terminology. At these prices you could buy 100 of them and the payoff will be massive in 12 months in my opinion. My goal is to have 100 litecoin by end of year and just HODL lol I just feel that once they pass $100 they'll never dip under that again. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:25:18
It's been strong support at $3,700... care to elaborate if you still think it's a dead cat bounce?
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:24:29

@_date: 2018-02-21 17:23:40
It didn’t break 11.7k yes reason to panic. This is where it topped off last time. It’s not a good sign, no matter how fast or slow it rises that it couldn’t break that barrier. Still in a downtrend

I'm planning to put in an order close to Nov when or if the price crashes/corrects and for many times more than OP, however, it won't be borrowed money. It'll be my money. If it goes away... poof... it's gone and I'm still ok. I'm still in my 20s, I'll survive. But the prospects now are too big to ignore. I think we're all relatively sure bitcoin is headed to $10,000 next year and $30-50,000 in 10 years. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:13:36

I bought at 75, was going to buy at 80. Seems like it's floor is 70, so just hang in there. Not many people saw litecoin going below 80 again let alone 70 after it hit 95. You're still 10 below the ATH which it will hit again... cmon it's just few bucks a coin and you're there. Just wait this out.

I clicked. All I got was a bunch of technical knowhow regarding Bitcoin, your thoughts on segwit2x and some idiocy about bitcoin being "infinitely divisible" therefore it's not a deflationary currency. As to any actual analysis why bitcoin will become less than $2... you just don't ever provide any. Until you can give a reason for such an extraordinary claim, I'm gonna go out on a very stable limb here and call you some kind of shill that is spreading FUD with positions counter to bitcoin or someone hoping to add to his positions again at $2. 
You my friend are what I refer to as a "smart idiot". You're someone who is very intelligent in some areas of a subject, but outside those areas you're dumb as rocks. 
Again, I'd love to hear you backup your $2 a bitcoin FUD.

First time I've seen this posted. I completely agree. Irma had to have some impact on the price of bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:34:50
I tend to agree that things like the "internet" "google" "email" are comparable to bitcoin. I ask people all the time about it, no one knows what it is. No one... literally lol I know it's anecdotal, but he's right at least in his comparison: 8 years into the internet was late 1980s or early 1990s depending on who you ask. Bitcoin, if only for the fact no one knows wtf it is, or they have heard of it as "some hacker internet money" is still early in its life.

Consolidation? It consolidated around $3,800-$4,000 for way longer than it's been around $3,500-$3,600. My gut tells me it's going lower. But you never know

Do you think it's a bubble created by a bunch of retards? I'm not following your rant. I would assume that if a million coins are sold at once to fiat the price would drop significantly, what am I missing?

I'm waiting for news like that to buy back in. People look at the price to determine to buy or sell. I look at this forum news and rumors. Wish I had sold earlier.

Same here. I sold at a loss (due to shitty trades) at $4,000. I bought back in at $3,300 but fucked up the earnings by trying to trade the dips as it rose. Lesson learned. I cut my losses, withdrew the remainder of funds, which was still substantial, to my back account and will but 1 single coin again at $3,000 or hopefully lower come end of Oct. It's not done falling as I type this it's back to $3,600 from this mornings high of $4,050.

What am I looking at here? I do agree that it's very close to that $5,000 resistance mark. That's a nice round and very intimidating number. I think if there is ever a time to short, it could be now.

There's a ton of uncertainty still with China. There are NEW rumors they are banning mining, and/or peer to peer OTC trading of bitcoin. Also, the price shot up $1,000 in 4 hours last week... that's not normal... it's dipped back to $3,500 a few times this past week. It might head there again. If so, I'm gonna buy in. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:55:22
It's at $3750 now still think it's gonna come back down? 
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:34:41
What 1 whole bitcoin is worth shouldn't be relevant. Things aren't purchased in whole bitcoins. They are purchased in tiny fractions of them. So for instance, that big basket of groceries would likely cost around .1 bitcoins or about $500
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:02:44
It's not priced in. China wasn't priced in at $3,500 when it went down to $3,000...

But they can try. And they can certainly add some risk involved in the process.

When it fell to 9,000$ few weeks ago and went up to $12.9k just days later, I felt like the market had recovered. This bounce up from $7.5k to $9k is nothing compared to that, be careful guys, ive lost a lot of funds and Ive timed the market very well, but it always comes back. Its above $9,000 now but it was at this level yesterday also. There might be some stabilization here and it might jump above $10-11K but this might not be over. These big rises are normal in a bubble like this. Sharp rises followed by slow bleedouts. If its $13k this time next week, you can breath easy. Otherwise if its struggling to hold $9-10k its only gonna come back down. This is not an asset Id want to be in just yet. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:46:56
What is a moving average? I'd be careful about buying at $4,000... it's a rocky road ahead in the next 6 weeks... Chinese exchanges closing, segwit2x hard fork. I believe what you're saying is true, that looking at metrics like a moving average (which I don't know what that is but I know it's one way to determine future price) can be helpful in still waters, but anything can happen to bitcoin price up to Nov. lot of money on the sidelines again...

It's hit close to $3,600 now. That's $600 increase in 2-3 hrs. Is that still hitting shorts...? Or have we seen the bottom at $2,950?

@_date: 2017-09-06 17:46:21
It's corrected twice for a combined $1,500 in the last month alone... dropped $800 from $4,400-$3,600 then just week or two later dropped from $4,900-$4,200. I think we're in healthy waters right now but who knows. I'm going to keep a couple bucks on GDAX ready to buy big time if it hits a major correction. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:38:10
So you still think it'll fall back to $3,000 again?
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:21:02
I’m gonna cash out around $7-8k, unless that number doesn’t come before the hard fork in Nov. then, I’ll cash out my profits only and just keep my initial investment. See. Yes I do. If you don’t think people are going to sell and take at the least some profits from this rise you...you have to admit that would happen or it’d be worth $100,000 by next year lol and $1,000,000 in 2-3 years

It’s not a bubble... the value flowing through bitcoin (money moved either way through buy orders and sell orders) is still very comparable to the general total volume of bitcoin on in existence. A bubble forms when something becomes worth way more than it’s utility or usefulness allows. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:36:58
Dropping 13% in less than a day isn’t a healthy correction.

They WILL be closing. Chinese may issue licenses again. But they WILL close. They are very large, and likely needed few extra weeks to shit down. Don't read more into things than there is.

The second part: ....not so much. Fraud requires intent. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 13:52:20
Unless it dips down to low $4,000s or you sold a shit ton of Bitcoin and bought back in at $4,500, I don't see your selling at $4,850 mattering. And trying to short like this with any consistency just isn't feasible so any money you might have made here will be negated when you try to short at $5,850 and it goes to $6,850 a week later 
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:26:05
Me too. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 03:08:31
It might crash back to where it is right now... or could crash from $45,000 down to $20,000 and you'd never get your chance to own even 1 bitcoin. $4,750 a bitcoin is going to be "fuck you money" cheap one day... buy it now and in 10 years you'll be a millionaire if you have $100,000 to spend now that is 
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:39:22
It's hit close to $3,600 now. That's $600 increase in 2-3 hrs. Is that still hitting shorts...? Or have we seen the bottom at $2,950?

Keep spreading FUD. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:50:11
It's definitely priced in. At $4,000 ($980 below ATH and 20% of ATH) it's got to be almost all priced in. I know people are saying it'll drop further to $3,900-3,600 etc but these same people also said bitcoin would drop to $1,200-1,300 when it was crashing in July prior to the fork. I think by years end well at LEAST see a $4,980 bitcoin again likely $6,000. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:37:04
So do you see this recovering?
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:43:54
It flirted with the ATH at 2,800 back in June before the fork... I wouldn’t see $4,800 as a ceiling anymore but a floor. 
@_date: 2017-09-11 22:15:41
They banned ICOs temporarily. Once regulations are in place it'll be legal again. Exchanges are likely to follow the same path but no way they get banned.

@_date: 2017-09-02 17:33:14
Well no shit... I shorted it but I shorted it and bought ETH which went right down with it. I didn't lose anything in the end but point is, if anyone didn't see this thing dropping as it neared $5,000 you had blinders on. I know it didn't show much resistance when it $4,000, but I think $5,000 carried a significant more amount of psychological weight to it than $4,000. If only ETH held up... shit! Lol
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:07:22
The FUD is gonna keep money on the sidelines and stagnate growth IMO. It's currently $1,000 below the ATH, which would normally be an amazing time to buy no matter what, but that FUD could turn out to be real damaging not only short term but long term. Banning Chinese miners and creating a third fork of the legacy chain... simultaneously no less, would bring the price down. On the other hand, if a consensus is formed and the fork is avoided and China doesn't ban miners or even P2P trading and rainbows and butterflies appear in the sky and everything ends happily ever after then yea... buy the shit out of it now lol I'm waiting on the price to move lower before I buy frankly. I lost a lot of money trying to trade this last dip that I honestly can't afford the risk of even getting in at $4,000. So take my comment with a grain of salt. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:31:32
You can't make decisions on whether something is possible is my point. Anything is possible. You have to weigh the odds and look at the circumstances. It goes back to the old "you could get hit by a car" argument. So do you still cross the road? Yes you do. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:07:29

Here's what people don't understand. Not all the bitcoins have been mined. Just wait. Wait until all of the bitcoins are in circulation. Them wait 5 years after that. If you had bought right now... you'll be a millionaire by then. I foresee one bitcoin being worth 100,000 easily. Those with 10 or more bitcoins now, who hold for the next ten years will be millionaires. I don't think that is unreasonable. I'm in now with my first $500 ($470 now lol) but I'm going to keep buying them at $500 a month until I hit 10 bitcoins in a few years. That's my strategy.
