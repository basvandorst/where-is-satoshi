Branches have no control over estate accounts. You should have applied for probate from a lawyer and presented that to the bank. Banks aren't keen to just give money to somebody without making sure their backs are covered. What if there was a legal dispute later, CIBC would be responsible. If you mom dad left u at the beneficiary it would have been easier.

I'm doing this right now. I bought in 2013 at ATH when the price was touching $1100. Kept buying when it hit $199 a few years later. Not large amounts, what ever I had lying around. I only broke even in 2016 Spring. Never Sold a even a tiny fraction. 
But when the Bitcoin Cash fork happened, I sold my BCH to build a Eco Conscious Yoga Retreat in the Philippines. I plan to accept Bitcoin and ETH once the project is up and running.

CIBC is a publicly listed company. It's been existent longer than Canada has been a country. It's very much Canadian institution. I believe pretty significant amount of their stocks are owned up employees( they have 45,000 employees). 
Their looking to move into the US and recently bought the US bank, Private Bank with HQ in Chicago. 
But it's usually criticized Financial Analyst for being too Canadian centric. Their dominance is in rural northern parts of Canada where in places where they are the only bank.

I'm so happy to see this! Very often now, people forget why Bitcoin became popular in the first place.

I'm not technical person..but I got strong stench of a snake oil salesmen from Roger. He just didn't seem genuine in his argument though he was very forceful in trying to convey it.

How does applying for Probate in US help with a legal process in Canada? It's a different country, it would have be recognized by the courts here. 
Again, I'm sorry that you had shitty experience. If you Mom had significant amount of assets, they would be reluctant to hand this over with out due process. All this stuff is usually handled by lawyer's that understand the nitty gritty of how estates are handled. 
I never assumed your dumb or for a that matter a fuck. It's a hard time for anybody to deal with and at points they feel lost dealing with a massive bureaucracy . But as i said, if your mom had left you as the beneficiary or given you power of attoney over the account, things would have gone much easier. 
You have no idea, how many ppl come out of the wood works right after somebody dies claiming it's suppose to be theirs funds. There's a lot of weird characters that hang at out retirement homes that try to take advantage of elderly.

They're investing in their own closed and verified user blockchains. Like ripple for instance. I see banks being important part of increasing adoption by everyday ppl. They might not push bitcoin but it'll still increase adoption indirectly.
