Probably none.
Most people who had large sum in there are traders or arbitragers that had probably made substantial profits previously.  
The newer and inexperience bitcoiners/miners who sold at gox because of higher selling price in Nov-Jan will suffer some losses, but unlikely to be substantial enough to commit suicide.

Waiting to see how many people doing such trade get defrauded by the goxbtc seller doing a "chargeback".    
Afterall, these are off-blockchain transfer between gox account.   Just need some social engineering manipulation with the gox helpdesk to get the transaction reverse :)

Roger did genuinely think that mtgox is solvent, as can be seen from him trying to buy cheap gox BTC just couple of days ago

Ever noticed almost every patches from Windows, OSx, Linux, Java and other popular software that we used today, is a security patch.   
Don't think too highly of developers that think they can code properly.   It is far easier to look for holes than to patch up the holes.

When you are buy mining rigs, you must always calculate your return-of-investment in term of bitcoins and not dollars.
If you bought a mining rig at 20 BTC (regardless of what the BTC cost at that point) , and in the life time (realistically 9 months) of the machine you can make more than 20 BTC, than it is a good buy.   Otherwise, you probably made an bad investment.
Regardless of mining profit, they can always still be used as heater to warm your room during winter.

Mtgox will announce that withdrawal is resume.   But the hot wallet will only have 100 bitcoins each day.
It will take another 200 days for the 20K+ of cheap bitcoin bought recently to leave the exchange.
6 months delay on Fiat withdrawal and 6 months delay on Bitcoins.    Fair and square.
@_date: 2014-01-27 14:14:41
It's applicable to all countries that do international wire using SWIFT.
For the manual withdrawal, I believe they could be using their personal bank account of their staff instead of the corporate bank account.
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:31:53
If you are asking this question, I assume you don't have any fund in MTGox yet.   
As such, I think you should probably just continue to sit on the fence and watch how the whole saga evolves.
@_date: 2014-01-27 14:22:03
Most exchanges these days don't keep too much bitcoins on their hot wallet because they are worrying about their server getting hack.    When you perform a withdrawal during time where there isn't enough btc on the hot wallet, someone at gox needs to trigger the process of transferring btc from their cold wallet.    
This will only happens during Japan working hours, and ever since the drop in their trading volume, they don't seems to work on weekends anymore.   Hence, if you do btc withdrawal on Friday evening (Japan time) and the hot wallet is out of btc, you will most likely need to wait till Monday morning (Japan time) for the transaction to complete.

There are plenty of support for gox.     The trade volume from the last few days speak for itself.     
The supporters just joined the troll to bash and crucify gox on every occasion just to create as much FUD as possible so that they can pick up cheap coins from the people that are easily panic by what they read on Internet.

Did the author even bother to visit First Meta site to see that First Meta is not an Bitcoin exchange and instead only deals with stuff like IMVU credits and Linden dollars?

Trust no One. None of the bitcoin exchanges has any form of deposit insurance unlike many of the online brokerage or FOREX exchange that are FDIC insured.
If you must day-trade on bitcoin exchanges, only play with what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:54:22
You can only do that if you are selling coins via localbitcoins
Otherwise, you will need the coins to be on the exchange before you can put up sell order.

You can profit from arbitrage between the exchanges.  But you will need to do your homework and understand the risks during each steps of the arbitrage.       
People who are already doing this for profit are unlikely to share any information with you, since more competitors equate to lesser profit for them.
My only advise for you is to start with a small amount that you can afford to lose or get stuck in gox and experiment with the processes yourself.

It is hard to resist the temptation of insider trading in an unregulated market.

People buying from mtgox with their trapped money are mainly due to them not knowing their option.
You can pay mtgox 5% processing fee to withdraw the money.  Sure, it is still a shitty option and you will still need to wait.  But that sure beat buying bitcoin at 20% marked up and suffer a bigger lost.
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:40:19
Why would anyone sue them? They always deliver -- just have to wait "2 weeks" for your mining rig.

The 120k bitcoins that they have (but missing) can account for roughly $60mil, enough to cover the customer's cash deposit.

There are probably 1001 ways for MTGOX to steal your money, but what you described is not one of them.
Stop making retarded allegation.
@_date: 2014-02-10 10:47:29
My understanding from the press release is that an attacker can trick exchanges into thinking that a successful withdrawal was unsuccessful. Hence, fooling the exchanges into sending the bitcoin a second time.   Essentially a dupe exploit at the expense of the exchange coin bank.
Mtgox probably suffers quite a fair bit of coins from the attack. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:32:34
Most of the trapped fiat would have been spend on buying the virtual goxbtc in the last 1-2weeks.

If Nasdaq listed companies that are fully regulated can cheat on their account books, where did you get all the guts to believe a statement made by an unregulated company that don't even operate within your own country. 
None of these exchanges published their financial statement. We can speculate all we want, but speculation won't get you the truth. There is no basis to trust one exchange more than the other.  Buy/sell and leave -- and if you need to keep funds on unregulated exchanges so you can day trade, understand the risk and prepare for the worst. 
Only idiots crucify an exchange for their losses because they didn't do their homework in the age of Google.

"The new system is just now getting under way, so there is still a back-log of withdrawals that we need to process. Our team is working hard to increase transaction speeds, but there is approximately a two-week back-log we need to overcome"

You can raise the withdrawal limit by talking to the support and depend on whether you send them Notarized Document or not.
