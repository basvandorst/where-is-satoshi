I'm not sure about the economists at but most economics majors and professors I talk to are very excited about it. Are they skeptical? Yes, but they are also excited at the prospect of what bitcoin is capable of. 
As far as I'm concerned, I do like bitcoins as a concept. I think a currency that is free flowing as bitcoins can make capital movement from once person to another, one business to another and even one country to another as easy as clicking a button. There are very few middlemen in there, little regulations and law to slow down the process and reduce costs as well. 
But here is the biggest problem with bitcoin: It is not accepted wide enough. A value of a currency depends on what you can buy with it and so far not enough commodities are available in the market that will accept bitcoins. 
So, what is driving the value of bitcoins right now is pure speculation. Which is also another dangerous aspect of bitcoins. Bitcoin has garnered more attention as a financial asset than a mean of exchange which means people are storing them not to buy things but rather invest in them in hopes of a return. This brings the risk of over valuing bitcoins and when something like that happens in a market, bubbles form and the market crashes. 
The future for bitcoin is blurry, I would not accept a single prediction by even the biggest analysts out there. What it will all boil down to is whether the acceptability of bitcoin widespread enough to be able to buy normal household goods and services at the same pace at which investors are running around for the currency.
