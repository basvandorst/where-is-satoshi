if they hadn't dragged ether into this now it would have happened later through a bankruptcy filing.
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:55:28
you are just trying to rationalize your selfishness.
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:06:10
you also admitted that there wasn't anything users could have done to prevent this from happening.
@_date: 2016-08-13 12:44:32
Even with 0 fee the majority will not choose btc.
cash back schemes and dispute settlement possibilities are a pretty big deal for consumers.
You just blame everything on the fees so you don't have to acknowledge that btc might not be very well equipped for retail.
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:48:06
since you live in taiwan and are a victim, have you talked to a lawyer about freezing those accounts?
@_date: 2016-08-13 15:56:18
bitcoin as a whole is undeniably growing.
An area to watch in my view is land registry security. There are a number of pilot projects running where they anchor the local land registry to the blockchain. This virtually kills the possibility of things like title deed fraud.
When people realize the bitcoin blockchain is used for these type of purposes, it's appeal as a store of value will benefit tremendously.
@_date: 2016-08-13 12:39:20


maybe that should tell you that btc can't really compete as a retail payment network.
Merchant adoption was very beneficial for bitcoin because of the mainstream acknowledgement but it can never be the end goal.
@_date: 2016-08-05 22:54:22
do you think there could be many taiwanese nationals affected by this hack and would they be able to pull of a freeze in short notice?
@_date: 2016-08-05 19:48:54
if people wouldn't trade btc it would be worth a fraction of the price 
so keep leeching but do it quietly in the background.
@_date: 2016-08-02 22:51:01
so how are these losses going to be dealt with?
Are all bitfinex account holders going to be affected or just the ones that had their bitgo wallets drained?
Could users have prevented their bitgo wallets from being drained? Can't recall any security warnings or recommendations concerning this issue.
 
Who is to blame for this hack, finex, bitgo, users?
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:56:33
flibbr!? 
how about you tell us where you reported the hack, what jurisdiction, which LE department.
Surely you can disclose this or tell us why not.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:26:35
So how is this going to be dealt with? Haircut4all and we move on, bankruptcy and years of agony or years of infighting between $,ETC,ETH,LTC and BTC account holders over who gets to take the hit?
In anycase, i don't really see you guys coughing up 60M
What % of bitcoins in your care was lost?
@_date: 2016-08-10 09:57:09
it's ca. 4% of the remaining value and to me that seems like a very low figure.
anyway, where we first were getting 24% back from mtgox we are now left with 20% and still counting down with no completion in sight.
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:05:33
That should simply not be possible according to the bitfinex website
Further, since we now enforce multi-institutional second factor authentication (Bitfinex will be the first factor and BitGo the second factor),  attackers are required to compromise both institutions before getting funds.
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:56:50
But how high are those reserves and what % of profit have the shareholders already drained in the past.
@_date: 2016-08-10 11:28:06
yes but they only recovered 24% of that so ca. 4%
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:51:12
no clue
bter had a similar situation but only around 7000 btc were stolen.

Hi Zane,
Could you already disclose what % of total assets was stolen?

lol the free market is doing what it wants right now.
Low value use cases have been replaced by high value use cases that don't give a damn about a $30 fee. Those high fees might be bad for you but they are good for bitcoin.
This entire 'bitcoin is broken because of high fees' narrative is orchestrated by whiners like roger ver who have invested in businesses that are priced of the bitcoin blockchain (casinos, bitpay, etc) They conveniently blame bitcoin for their own failures.
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:22:25

In  theory this could result in a 51% attack even though every game theory scenario would prohibit a rational actor from doing that.
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:36:08
where did i appeal to authority?
I merely pointed out reality as i experienced it over many years. Should I be sorry for being an early adopter? My experience is that the 0 fee years weren't exactly a successful time when it came to onboarding the $2 a day crowd or retail payments for that matter.
mine is anecdotal evidence, i know. but what exactly is your evidence that makes you so sure? I am genuinely interested but you can't just go around making definite statements without any evidence backing it up.
why so snarky? if you are so sure that low on-chain fees are paramount to cryptos success and big blocks are the only way forward then go for another coin. I really wish you the best of luck.  
@_date: 2018-01-28 06:17:37
I Am fine with AML KYC.  capital controls is another story and that is what gives Bitcoin value in China and India.
Capital controls allow a dysfunctional monetary system, like India and China have, to burden the population with the failures of the state.

Coinbase is just looking out for nr1.
They want a centralised coin like ETH or BCH to take over. It's much easier for coinbase to strike a deal with the ethereum foundation or roger ver then it is to argue with a bunch of cypherpunks that don't have any decisive power anyway.
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:23:27

Right so those people can't even afford a smart phone but it's the $1 fee that keeps them out of Bitcoin.

you should look into one of the many other use cases like Proof of existense/immutability/data integrity. It solves an actual problem because it provides trust without having to rely on humans. Might not be a big deal in the developed world but it is a game changer in the developing world.
Google companies like Chain, Bitfury, Factom, Chromaway, Tierion, and so on. They all use the bitcoin blockchain for proof of data integrity/existence/immutability.
Bitfury is a great example, they secure the georgian land registry via bitcoin. A secure land registry opens Georgia's property market to foreign retail investors and this creates growth for all Georgians.
Compared to this, I regard retail payments as a sideshow. There are very few legal instances where crypto is preferable over paypal so it will always stay a niche case.
What do you think will do more to advance Bitcoin's proposition as a store of value? Buying coffee on-chain or securing the property stock of entire nations?
BTW bitfury is fine with paying a $50 fee because $1000 would still be a steal!
Bitcoin is being developed into the base layer of decentralized trust and it's the only game in town for that role.
@_date: 2018-01-22 06:06:52
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:41:02
So let's run through how this shorting risk would work in reality.
To do what you suggest you would first have to become a pretty big hub. How else can you create enough panic to move the market? To become a big enough hub would take years.
So once you have done all that, you would be willing to squander it all for one  short opportunity?
Again, where is the ratio in that strategy?
Besides, short term price movements are irrelevant in relation to long term design choices.
@_date: 2018-01-08 11:44:34

yes retail payments were partly responsible for the 2014 bear market.
Retail payments were great as a proof of concept and it got bitcoin some mainstream attention and credibility.
Problem is that certain groups like to pretend it is the one and only use case for crypto. On top of that they are fine with destroying cryptos unique selling points to keep the fees low so they can buy their coffee.

LTC and BCH chains are empty so coinbase can spam it as they see fit.
Coinbase obviously does not care about the long term of coins (just themselves) so should LTC chain ever fill up then coinbase will just blame LTC development and hop over to the next chain
Coinbase is locus and it needs to be exterminated. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:57:30
that micropayment business could use LN to move it's funds straight into an exchange and cash out that way.
The exchange will also be a channel factory so people buying bitcoin from the exchange will have their coins parked in a LN channel from the start.
On-chain will be for high value transactions only. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:26:31
Yes and this is happening already. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:52:12
nope segwit and LN won't help them solve coinbase's past mistakes, bigger blocks would.
so coinbase have been lobbying for bigger blocks. Not because they care for bitcoin or the community but to hide their own gross incompetence.

I know that retail payments were on the decline long before the fees went high.

lol hardly anyone uses bitcoin to buy those games, it's the main reason for discontinuing it;)
Imagine if you take out al the under age gamers that use it (illegally) then there would be virtually no one left;)
It doesn't matter, retail payments were a great first proof of concept use case. Merchants would get free publicity and a cutting edge image and bitcoin got some mainstream credibility. 
In the end bitcoin retail payments are just a sideshow for idiots. A way to relieve them of their bitcoin for some shitcoin. The shitcoin will lure the idiots in with low fees through fast, large blocks.  
Sadly, the idiots don't realize that this fast, large block route will lead to centralisation down the road (if it's actually ever going to be used for something;).
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:02:39
This might come as a surprise to you but there have been more than a few examples where humanity managed to improve things over time. 
Asics will get commoditized and renewables will have a massive impact on decentralisation. Give it 2 years and the POW mining industry will be unrecognizable and much more decentralized than any POS system could ever dream of.
@_date: 2018-01-28 12:20:26
oh ok so they were priced out already in 2013, 2014 2015 and 2016 when fees were near 0. or did the $2 a day crowd switch to doge?
i spend a lot of time in these type of countries (again have you ever been?) and i actually do need to leave the expat enclaves into the poorer parts.
over the years I have gifted dozens of bitcoin to people in these countries. obviously not to the $2 a day crowd because their only focus is daily survival as in how to get food today.
the people i gave bitcoin to treat it as a store of value.  what they were hoping for is a trade route circumventing their legacy currencies and bureaucracies.
This is where lightning could come in. I guess we want the same thing but you want big blocks to get there and i think this is a dead end because it will lead to centralization and ultimately the same capital controls these people experience today. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 10:49:14

The $2 a day crowd does not have smart phones. Have you ever even been to a fourth world country?
They would be much better served by a village LN hub. They could actually make some money of it instead of paying fees.
And I know about coinapult doing the sms thing in 2013 already. Thing is that nobody in the third world used it back then because their priorities aren't with day to day payments but with hyper inflation.
Roger ver et all have been lying about a blockchain being a free resource. That's not Bitcoin' s fault.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:44:10
yes exactly;)
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:34:26
The idea is to not trust humans anymore. centralized databases work pretty well in the developed world but it's a disaster in most developing countries.
The centralized database will still exist but a decentralised layer is added. This decentralised layer prevents the notaries and civil servants from defrauding people because the chance of getting caught is increased to 100% via the bitcoin hash. it either corresponds with the centralized land registry entry or it doesn't.
real estate is just the start. The 'trust industry' is worth trillions. Banks, notaries, stock exchanges and even governments derive their power and value from the fact that we (the people) have to trust them. If we force centralised legacy organisations to anchor their data to a public blockchain then that gives the people the power to audit the top. 
at this moment bitcoin is the most secure chain out there. Another public chain could come along but the present competitors all have the wrong priorities (low fees through fast, large blocks). Those priorities will set in motion an unstoppable centralizing force should these chains ever experience load like the bitcoin blockchain.
Again, fees are a side show for idiots. It is used to fleece noobs of their bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:46:27
The 1000 own 40% buzzline is one of the many FUD lies currently circulating to shake out weak hands.
Those addresses are predominantly owned by exchanges and other custodial services. They hold bitcoin for other people. So 1 of those addresses could hold the bitcoin for hundreds of thousands of people.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:37:59

I hope you are right as I am invested in several coins.
They all have their use cases. Bitcoin is being developed into the  baselayer of decentralised trust. Litecoin and bcash are more then welcome to go for the retail payment market.
 What bugs me is the constant trashing of Bitcoin by bcash supporters. As if retail payments are the one and only use case.

My bet is that they will keep going for option 1.

oeps sorry haha. I actually agree with you;)
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:11:24
small retail payments will make a come back but on the second layers (lightning, LIT, thunder, etc). On-chain, it is not really sustainable. That's why pretty much every other crypto is ~~copying LN~~ working on second layer solutions to accommodate small, fast payments with enhanced privacy.
It's like the internet. You couldn't run youtube on it from day one. 
Building that responsibly and securely takes time.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:31:49
the reason for factom to prefer bitcoin is the same reason why ordinary people should choose bitcoin as their preferred store of value/speculation.
Georgia is the first example of a government submitting it's data to the scrutiny and security of the bitcoin blockchain and many others are in georgia's trail. Every company, institution or country that does this strengthens bitcoin's position as a truly immutable, unattackable blockchain. How can one country attempt to ban bitcoin when another is using it to tackle corruption? 
Bitcoin development has immutability and censorship resistance through decentralisation as it's top priority. Other coins have other priorities and that's fine but they almost always exclude that coin from competing in the 'proof of data integrity' arena against bitcoin.
I just happen to think that proof of data integrity/immutability is the blockchain's killer app. It has the potential to eradicate corruption and allow for the people to audit the 'top'. 
Having a stake in the main contender to become the base layer of decentralised trust sounds like a pretty good speculative bet to me.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:11:46
I have no problem with bitcoin cash. It's their general marketing strategy that annoys me. The bcash community spends more time trashing bitcoin then they do promoting bcash. Furthermore, their constant misrepresentation of crypto as a one trick pony (slow paypal) is damaging to the entire space.
Retail payments are maybe 5% of bitcoin's speculative value. Bitcoin has tried retail payments since 2012. It didn't really take after the early adopters were done cashing out. Luckily bitcoin moved on to higher value use cases that don't care about a $50 fee. It's the free market in action. Too bad for Roger Ver's casinos but they got priced out. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:50:51
 Again,payments are maybe 5% of cryptos speculative value. It's just one app! Besides, retail payment volume can only happen of-chain no matter the crypto. So every crypto is ~~copying LN~~ working on second layers to accommodate small instant transactions with enhanced privacy.
Bitcoin does not have a problem, certain use cases have a problem. Low value use cases (casino's, bitpay, etc) are being driven off chain by high value use cases like proof of data integrity.

Fees are an afterthought to these companies.
Retail payments will make a come back but not at the expense of bitcoin's unique selling points. certain use cases not being able to pay the current fees is no reason to destroy bitcoin.

in the year 2140. This might seem like a long time but the block reward halves every 4 years, next in 2020. So by 2028 the block reward is only 1.5625 btc.
bitcoin is meant to survive us all. Your great grandchildren should still be able to use it. This can only happen if miners can count on a steady fee income. The most reliable way of forecasting fee income is when you can count on a full mempool.

LTC is the only one of your examples that is at least attempting to be censorship resistant, immutable and decentralised.
I don't own LTC but do hold iota and eth. They have other qualities and use cases but they are definitely not competing in the same arena as Bitcoin.

I believe that is the ether fan boy's dream;) Bitcoin is the most anti establishment coin out there. it is being developed into the base layer of decentralised trust. In the end it will allow 'the people' to audit 'the top'.
I wish all the other coins fun with their high txps and fast blocks, while it lasts. 
 
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:34:31
retail payments are just one application. It represents maybe 5% of bitcoin's value. If your retail tx is not at risk of censorship or reversal then there really isn't much of an advantage over visa.
There are a lot of disadvantages for the consumer though. Such as no cashbacks, bonus points, insurance, etc.

People are bullish because those high fees show that transacting on the bitcoin blockchain is in high demand. No other crypto can charge such high fees as bitcoin. The high fees ensure bitcoin's survival in a 0 block reward environment. Miners need to keep being rewarded after the last bitcoin has been found.

@_date: 2017-12-26 12:17:13
It would be a temporary fix with serious implications down the road. 
Bcash, for instance, wants 1GB blocks. Who would still run a node If it meant having to up and download 1GB every 10 minutes, forever? A few casino’s and some miners, that’s who. When nodes are concentrated in a few hands then censoring becomes very easy. We would be back at the paypal situation where we can only transact if our overlords allow it. 
1GB blocks would also make it easy for things like the great chinese firewall to block bitcoin traffic. 1GB every 10 minutes is a bit more obvious compared to 1mb every 10 minutes. Big blockers don't care about any of that. They want low fees now at the expense of the future.
People like roger ver are fine with this paypal 2.0 outcome. They would be the ones running the nodes;) It's self interest in its purest form. This entire bcash nonsense started when casino's and other 'free blockchain' use cases were priced out of bitcoin by higher value use cases that don't mind paying a $50 fee. Instead of investing in second layer tech to accommodate their needs they decided to kick the can down the road with bcash and declare bitcoin dead because it cares for the future, how ironic.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:05:03
so you are saying bitcoin is in high demand and your cheap fee tx is no longer valid, on-chain.

the electricity thing is such a lame argument.
Most miners go where there is an electricity surplus. Either the electricity goes to waste because there is no demand or it is used to mine bitcoin and create some jobs. Tough choice!
Furthermore, the world is switching to renewable energy anyway so the electricity argument will have 0 merit within the next decade.

That would be the  Venezuelan national crypto currency. 0 fees, unlimited txps and instant confirmations.
Just like any other alt that achieves this goal, they got there by sacrificing decentralization, censorship resistance and immutability.

@_date: 2017-12-07 12:34:34
no it's not!
miners go to areas with over capacity. The electricity is being produced regardless of demand.
The choice in these areas is letting the electricity run of into the earth or using it to mine bitcoins (tax revenue, jobs). Does not seem like such a tough choice.
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:45:20


People on those income levels aren't using crypto to begin with and never have, don't be naive. They are not driving the venezuelan adoption. 
Besides, what people wish to use is not relevant at this point in time. Crypto is still in the early stages of development. The second and third layers are suited to serve the $5 a day crowd, it won't happen on-chain.
I have a very hard time believing that all these low fee don quixote's are actually out fighting for those poor venezuelans. Most are just butthurt that their 0 fee (leech of the chain for free) business models are doomed. People like roger ver or erik voorhees don't give a damn about the third world.
 
Have you ever even been to a third world country? I spend about half my time there. Low fees aren't their priority. Protection against their kleptocratic government is the priority and bitcoin has been doing that job like nothing else before in history.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:38:58
retail payments are maybe 5% of cryptos speculative value, it's just one app. besides, it can only happen in a meaningful way of-chain. Every crypto is ~~copying LN~~ working on second layers to accommodate small instant transactions with enhanced privacy. 
Bitcoin's so called 'problem' is being the only crypto that attracts use cases that don't give a damn about a $30 fee. It's the free market in action. Low value use cases (casino's, bitpay, etc) are being driven off chain by high value use cases like proof of data integrity.
 
I just happen to think that proof of data integrity/immutability is the blockchain's killer app. It has the potential to eradicate corruption and allow for 'the people' to audit the 'top'.
Bitcoin development has immutability and censorship resistance through decentralisation as it's top priority. Other coins have other priorities and that's fine but they almost always exclude that coin from competing in the 'proof of data integrity' arena against bitcoin.
Georgia is the first example of a government submitting it's data to the scrutiny and security of the bitcoin blockchain and many others are in georgia's trail. Every company, institution or country that does this strengthens bitcoin's position as a truly immutable, unattackable blockchain. How can one country attempt to ban bitcoin when another is using it to tackle corruption?
Retail payments will make a come back but not at the expense of bitcoin's unique selling points.
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:29:54
the high fees are great because it shows how valuable 'bitcoin as a service' already is. 
The casino's and coffee buyers that can't transact on-chain anymore have been priced out by higher value use cases. Anyone complaining can take it up with the free market.
and yes, proving that bitcoin works in a 0 reward environment is a massive achievement. the idea is to build bitcoin into something eternal after all.

We all want the same and it will happen for bitcoin! 
The choice is between cramming it all on chain or building second and third layers to handle the load of a p2p ecash system. (btw bitcoin is hardly ever p2p because you need miners and nodes so... satoshi really messed up with that stupid title;)
I support second and third layers. Once the base layer is no longer decentralised it does not matter what you do on the second and third layers because they are all compromised.
 
Immutability and censorship resistance through decentralisation is what sets crypto apart from mastercard. So i am sceptical of coins that compete with bitcoin by squandering those USP's in favor of cheap tx fees, fast confirmations and high txps. That's like 99% of the competition out the window.
IOTA holds promise but they still do not have a reliable wallet and i don't see them turning of the coordinator any time soon if ever. IOTA with the coordinator still is a good deal because it solves some actual problems. It's not problems people in venezuela are dealing with though;)

Well if it reaches 1500 I am buying hand over fist. it does not break the long term trend.
big miners went bankrupt in the last bear market and people were saying the same things as you are now.
Reality is that with free electricity mining is always profitable. I am actually hoping that miners go bust so their asics get auctioned of at pennies to the dollar.
Bitcoin is big in Venezuela, for a large part because a Venezuelan group bought all the knc miners after their bankruptcy and sold them on to Venezuelans. Electricity is virtually free in Venezuela so these miners are still profitable today.
As for a 51% attack, why? That will be a sure fire way to get your asics bricked via a pow change.

Also decentralization is not an advantage in most cases so that knocks out ca. 99% of alt business models. Especially if you use decentralized architecture and then run it as a centralized company like every alt does. I mean, how is that adding value beyond fleecing noobs of their money via an ico?

@_date: 2018-08-17 10:19:00
the link above gives you the facts so you can stop lying to yourself and others
Oh and before you start about eth doing more transactions, that's actually a sign of inefficient blockspace use by ethereum.
You see, with eth one output is one input. Bitcoin already has batching working so one output could be 1000 inputs. So 1 tx could actually cover 1000's of tx's but they don't show up in the tx stat because it only looks at outputs (you also pay only 1 fee so that's pretty sweet).
Ethereum devs are in the process of 'borrowing' batching and child pays for parent tech from bitcoin. They will give it a cool new name so that all the ether fans can keep believing that eth devs are great innovators.
edit: EOS totally dwarfs ETH tx count. They are both centralised so why not go for EOS, the one that actually works?

Merchants should share the wealth with us on a permanent basis. They have an immediate 2% gain through the transaction fee’s. 
Giving us a 2.5% discount would be a marginal cost to them and I am sure the other advantages Bitcoin offers are worth at least 0.5% to them
After all, besides the benefits OP already mentioned, a merchant creates a competitive edge through lower pricing and free publicity within the Bitcoin community. Convincing merchants to go this route should be easy and a priority for both Bitpay and Coinbase.
In fact we should stop spending bitcoin unless we get a discount.

sorry i didn't make my point clear enough. I am not looking to replace the notary or any part of the current system. We would all be dead before that happens.
It would, however, already be useful to have additional proof of ownership as protection against corrupt notaries and land registry civil servants. 
It would basically be a product you would sell to honest notaries, real estate agents and property developers in corrupt countries.
The below is just one example of title deed fraud that would be far less likely to occur with additional incorruptible proof of ownership.

It is impossible to overstate the significance of this (old) news.
Sidechains will finally let bitcoin capitalize on it's core selling point: trust by computation.
Transfer of title over a blockchain is a superior product compared to the legacy trusted third party alternatives.
That's why we should stop referring to bitcoin as a cheap way of exchanging value. it is not cheap but superieur and that's what justifies all the resources going into mining.
Because of the superior qualities of the blockchain as a trust provider, the transaction fees on sidechains can be magnitudes higher then what we are used to now.
Justifiably higher fees would solve the long term mining incentive problem.
i think we will see more downward price pressure but the future has never looked better

@_date: 2014-03-23 07:32:36
a sane argument would be that the finite supply nature of bitcoin would ensure the top 1% ownership percentage dwindling down to a more acceptable figure because the top 1% will keep spending their bitcoins over time. 
Another argument is that the newly mined bitcoins will typically not end up in the 1% hands as happens with fiat currencies. 
OP's arguments are the ones of a lottery winner that has gone bonking megalomaniac.
Currently the top 1% is the main problem of bitcoin because most of them got lucky and do not have the intelligence or the skill set to guide the world towards OP's expressed ideals.
I would bet that the majority of the bitcoin 1% hasn't been successful at much else (with dealing drugs and stealing as notable exceptions).
The best thing the 1% can do is shut up and spend spend spend

that's because nobody uses those chains for actual real world commerce.
any chain that overtakes bitcoin will run into the same capacity problems because there is a limit to on chain scaling.

what's needed now is a massive bitcoin crash.
That will teach the miners what the market wants.
I wouldn't be surprised if testing the market is what they are after. 
Next, maybe one of the chinese pools starts signalling segwit and if that results in the price going up we will get segwit.

AXA ventures was one of 12 initial investors. Their contribution was $8M max. That buys them virtually no influence.

Along with pretty much everybody else that has some proven technical knowledge.
@_date: 2017-02-23 16:21:36
Sorry but you have been lied to by r/btc
Core IS the code (not some evil closed of group) and anyone that writes good code can have that merged into bitcoin. 
It's just that won't happen unless you manage to convince over 100  core contributors that it is a good idea.
BU is 5 guys without a track record. 99% of their code is copied from core and the other 1% is untested but has already proven itself to be buggy.
BU also looks to introduce a human element into machine to machine consensus. This is the same as killing bitcoin.
BTW I am not against bigger blocks, hardly anyone is.

he might be anti bitcoin but at least he studies up on the subject before sharing his opinion.
r/btc pretends to be pro bitcoin but they are just bag holding alts (on roger's recommendation;)
@_date: 2017-02-07 16:04:29
Great to hear, problem is that there aren't any real developers among the BU crowd.
So as per the usual the BU crowd doesn't actually create anything. They just wait for somebody else to solve it and then complain because using the blockchain isn't free as was promised to them by satoshi's alleged vision.
Don't forget: the BU code consists of 99% core code. Only the bugs are developed by the BU team.
All BU does is block progress and justify it with some bogus censorship NWO conspiracy theory that allows the BU crowd to feel like the good guys, the revolutionaries. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:51:54
yes he would have preferred it that way but now he supports what's on the table: segwit. The tweet is from 20/11/16 and segwit signalling had already started
Gavin is a rational actor. He looks at the tech and leaves politics and personal grudges out of it. It's admirable and something r/btc could learn from
@_date: 2017-02-19 13:56:17
Jihan wu is overplaying his hand now.
It is one thing to have centralised mining but if the king pin starts wielding it as a weapon, the mainstream will pick up on it at some point.
Then we are in for the mother of all crashes and it will cause permanent damage to (the illusion of) decentralisation.
This shitshow could potentially make the mtgox disaster look like an innocent prank.
Jihan Wu is either stupid or out to kill bitcoin. I find it hard to believe he is stupid.

that's just the image he likes to portray of himself. 
Just browse through his court transcripts. Then imagine somebody like that pressured by 3 letter agencies. 
Roger has a big mouth but it would take one bitchslap to instantly turn him into a good little STATE servant.
@_date: 2017-02-08 10:54:47
letting miners decide on the blocksize is allowing them to bump of nodes and it will lead to centralisation and censorship.
This is a risk not worth taking if the only upside is buying coffee on chain
@_date: 2017-02-23 12:46:34
lol no he doesn't know
have you ever heard him discuss bitcoin? he still doesn't get why nodes are important. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 09:43:01
but they didn't change to ethereum! Those ideas were shelved after the dao hard fork. that should teach you something  about the risks of contentious hard forks.
There is no limit to the amount of transactions they can combine into one hash onto the bitcoin blockchain so a blocksize increase is not a necessity to them
@_date: 2017-02-23 15:28:54
you mean the mining cartel?
@_date: 2017-02-28 15:46:05
spam is any business model that depends on the blockchain being nearly free.
nothing is for free and just because certain people have been spreading the free blockchain lie does not mean we have to give in to those people and their unrealistic wishes. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 14:44:00
The discussion over at r/btc is just comedy gold.
Their main argument against segwit boils down to it being too complicated and so it should be blocked because they don't get it.
@_date: 2017-02-21 00:58:08
what's telling about this episode in roger's life is how he still denies any wrongdoing. He refers to it as a victimless crime. 
Driving drunk without killing anyone is also a victimless crime. I guess that's OK with Roger as well.
This is the risk mentality he now wants to use on bitcoin via BU.
@_date: 2017-02-19 17:46:44
yes bad P.R. but his $100M war chest will be like a needle fighting a sword. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:14:18
Bitcoin being concentrated in the hands of very few early adopters is the biggest flaw of this coin.
You proof this point by only talking about the mistakes mtgox made without even considering the possibility of attempting to find an disown the criminals responsible for this heist. 
you r a real smooth talker but all you really say is: The coins are gone, meh. On to the next clusterfuck.
Are you serious? Well i guess you can't expect much vision, empathy or ideals from a gambling baron/ bitcoin oligarch.

Computers double in power every two years, while the population doubles every few decades, so this is rapidly becoming less and less important. Basically, bitcoin couldn't have worked if it had been released 10 years earlier, computers are now at the point where there's a bit of pain today, and a decade from now we'll be able to handle a blockchain orders of magnitude larger with ease. Satoshi knew this. So let's stop worrying so much about the size of the blockchain today.
@_date: 2017-02-28 10:08:50

now now i wouldn't call him a nobody because i just found this piece of genius browsing through his posts:
I'm in favor of some hardcoded dynamic blocksize algoritm, but this solution isn't popular and seems it can't work if there's a fixed supply (e.g. xmr), which is probably the reason why it's not popular.
Thank you u/xpiqu, we just have to lift the btc supply cap and all of our problems are solved. 21M is a silly number anyway. 
@_date: 2017-02-27 09:26:12
people don't actually use ethereum beyond speculation so the ethereum chain split didn't have any implications other than more speculation.
a bitcoin chain split would deplete the market cap of both chains making them less suitable for high volume low volatility transactions like bundled remittances. Being able to move funds without moving the market is a crucial part of bitcoin's network effect.
a chain split would kill that benefit and it would give alts some hope of becoming number one instead of bitcoin.
dethroning bitcoin is what BU wants. BU pumpers are predominantly shitcoin bagholders  
@_date: 2017-02-12 16:35:41
So it is not a problem yet but the whole point should be to prevent it from becoming an issue.
Bitcoin will not be a good store of value when it isn't worst case scenario proof. Betting on moore's law and an ever increasing btc price is not the way forward if you want to install trust in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:40:37
it is not about bitcoin or it's value. it is about the blockchain technology.
@_date: 2017-02-04 16:34:58
all BU has is roger ver and a handful of chinese miners. Literally everybody else worth its salt in bitcoin is on the segwit side.
But the miners can make it look like BU has real world traction and roger ver has his shill army brigading so this shit show could actually end up splitting bitcoin and send us all back to goblin town.
The fact that miners are now threatening core with 51% attacks should they decide to split is just typical and no one in their right mind will want to hold any value in a blockchain controlled by these types of thugs.

you have been lied to by the people that build businesses around this notion that the blockchain is a free resource (casinos, coinbase, circle, etc).
It is a decentralised global asset ledger. The most powerful anti corruption weapon humanity has ever seen. 
it is ludicrous to use it to buy coffee or run a casino on top of it. Those were merely the first proof of concept use cases. Now it is time for those businesses to find another blockchain to leach of.

bitcoin makes it easier for chinese people to invest. they can circumvent capital controls using bitcoin. 
It would be useful if they can pump it straight into property because in the U.S. no one asks questions about the origins of the money if you buy property.
This is due to the NAR's exemption from anti-money laundering regulations. 
cutting out the bank by going straight from bitcoin to property would make it considerably easier.

@_date: 2017-03-02 16:14:36
no we need high fees to show the world that bitcoin is viable long term.
if your business depends on a nearly free blockchain then you made a critical error and you only have yourself to blame.
did all you guys got a little leaflet with standard replies to sensible arguments? you all sound like the same sockpuppet
@_date: 2017-02-08 10:47:01
yes and if the money transmitters just batch a bunch of bitcoin transactions together (as they already do with the korea-philippines remittance corridor) then the fees per remittance will stay low.
@_date: 2017-02-10 12:28:03
that risk is neglectable (95% threshold) compared to a contentious hard fork.

why should the blockchain be nearly free so some casino can keep  spamming it, day in day out?
@_date: 2017-03-12 15:29:45
well that is just an assumption and you are probably wrong
LN hubs can run behind TOR not exactly something the AXA crowd is after.
You and I can become a hub. LN gives meaning to the phrase be your own bank because with LN we can actually become one and nobody will know who is behind those 'banks', let alone stop it.
Compare that to the centralisation pressure BU would create. Mining centralisation is already the biggest threat to bitcoin and BU wants to give miners near absolute power. Including knocking nodes of the network by an ever increasing blocksize.
Roger ver said it himself he is fine if bitcoin turns into paypal coin and BU is the way to get there.

LN is open source even blockchain.info is working on an implementation based upon that code (7 more LN projects in development right now). Ironically roger will benefit from it since he invested in blockchain.info

what has he done? he has been misinforming people about what bitcoin is since the day he got involved and crowned himself bitcoin jesus.
Now the chickens are coming home to roost because a POW blockchain turns out to not be a free resource (who would have thought). 
Up until now that still didn't stop roger from repeating the same free blockchain lie and on top of that he uses this lie to pump a plethora of alt coins for over a year now.

satoshi completely missed the advent of asics. 
'one cpu one vote' is a major miscalculation on his side. Besides, the white paper was full of mistakes. Would we have followed it, bitcoin would have died a long time ago.
In case you missed it: bitcoin is not religion and satoshi is not god.
Typical how you immediately have to fall back on your holy white paper bible if the discussion takes a turn you can't fud your way out of.
If AXA has so much power: why don't they stop blockstream from making bitcoin censorship resistant? Why would they allow the TOR functionality if what you say is true?
What is the function of peer to peer electronic cash? it is being able to transact even if tptb want to censor your transaction. 
Just because some people mistake that for buying coffee and other trivial purchases that will never be censored does not mean we have to give in to these ridiculous wishes.

ehm because the BU crowd constantly talks about attacking the minority chain after the fork.
Because they refuse to put anything in place preventing such attacks.

@_date: 2017-03-19 16:16:58
you just refuse to understand how open source works.

@_date: 2017-03-05 12:03:58
1. r/btc is dedicated to it. At some point you have to retaliate in kind. 
2. so he gambled, that doesn't make him an authority on anything
3. he endangered the lives of everybody in his apartment building and the mailmen unknowingly delivering his illegal explosives. He never showed any remorse. To this day he still calls it a victimless crime. 
4. he has been pumping alts for over a year. he dedicated an entire sub to smearing core through baseless conspiracy and censorship theories. BU is an attack on bitcoin's unique selling points and for what, being able to buy coffee through bitpay?
you are right he is a fucking joke but his money makes him a danger and it's about time people spoke out against it.
@_date: 2017-03-12 12:05:35

check the post history of the most prolific posters on that cesspool of a sub and you will find the majority neck deep in some shit coin or another.
Especially roger ver has been pumping alts for over a year and that guy should disclose his btc holdings or stfu because i would be very surprised if he has more than a 100k bitcoins left
@_date: 2017-03-02 07:16:03
it isn't that black and white
the bitcoin as gold crowd usually realizes that it won't happen without some utility beyond store of value. There are plenty of second layer apps in the works that give bitcoin that utility as ultimate proof of immutability.
The big block side think that the only use case is P2P cash. if that fails, bitcoin will fail, at least in their minds.
They are blind to the fact that paying for coffee with btc doesn't actually provide any utility because nobody will ever try to censor your coffee purchase. So why would you want to use a 3.5 exahash computer network for that? 
@_date: 2017-03-11 18:36:04
nah it's trolling to create a conspiracy censorship narrative.
It's trolling to treat a loose collective of developers as a closed of group that thinks with one mind.
It's trolling to push a bogus axa, nwo, bilderberg story as fact.

Venezuelans do use bitcoin and since they aren't hung up on some simplified version of satoshis vision (like the BU crowd) they just use bitcoin debit cards to relieve the strain on the blockchain and save on fees.

it is so sad how you guys think that p2p cash means being able to use btc for the most trivial purchases like coffee.
p2p cash means that you can still transact even if governments, banks, etc want to block/censor that transaction.
That is what gives btc value. A POW blockchain is by design not meant for day to day purchases.

@_date: 2017-03-13 08:56:30
bitcoin is about excluding any and all risk to maintain immutability and censorship resistance.
BU gives miners way too much control. They could centralize bitcoin by knocking of nodes via an ever increasing blocksize.
When most nodes are gone they can start censoring transactions because nodes will be centralised in a few big data centers.
There are plenty of parties that want to see this happen but none of them have bitcoin's best interest in mind. The pboc would love it for instance (capital controls). Or the U.S, they have a beef with wikileaks so they would want to see their donations censored of the network. 
That's a really bad trade off if all we get in return is cheap fees so people can keep buying trivial shit with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-10 09:06:34

Satoshi was just wrong! one cpu, one vote give me a break. He totally missed the advent of asics and its implications.
Besides miners have an investment horizon of 12 months. they are not committed to bitcoin's long term viability.

you have to be truly delusional to think that any exchange is going to list BUT as BTC. All BUT has is the chinese mining cartel (one guy) without it nobody  would even know it existed because it is clearly the most inferior alternative to core. Classic and XT were genius compared to the BU shit show.
It isn't just GDAX either. Bitfinex and the japanese exchanges are of the same opinion. Furthermore CEO's tend to listen to their CTO on technical matters.
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:29:26
2 days ago a critical bug was found in BU, nothing but crickets on that from roger but his minions spin it into an attack by core.
Yesterday roger is already back out in force bashing core and promoting BU.
If that is not misinforming people i don't know what is. So no need to dive into his earlier work.
The market is crashing and the exodus into alts is accelerating because the market now realizes: these guys will stop at nothing until they forcefully fed bitcoin it's BU death pill.
Anyone supporting BU and roger ver at this point is either a mindless idiot or on the payroll.
You are not a mindless idiot Zane so that leads me to my next question: is head of otc sales a part time job?

@_date: 2017-03-08 15:29:08
BU is not about bigger blocks. It is about centralising control by knocking nodes of the network via an ever increasing blocksize.
The ultimate goal is only a handful of large miners being able to run nodes in big data centers. At that point bitcoin will just be another paypal where transactions can be blocked if they don't align with the interests of tptb.
One of Bitcoin's most important unique selling points is censorship resistance. Wikileaks for example still exists and thrives because nobody can stop people from donating bitcoin to them.
BU will kill this quality and for what? so that roger can keep spending his bitcoin on trivial purchases like coffee that will never be censored to begin with. that's a really bad trade off, don't you think?
Nobody over at r/btc ever brings this up because they either don't know, are altcoin bag holders that want to kill btc via BU or shills paid by roger ver.

burger joints don't expect to operate rent free do they?
that is basically what all the blockchain leechers expect to do forever (casino's, payment processors, etc) they better get bumped of now because nothing is free in this world, definitely not a POW blockchain.
When do burger purchases get censored? that's right never, so why use a POW blockchain for something trivial like that?
P2P cash does not mean buying coffee it means still being able to transact even when tptb want to censor a transaction.
That's why donating to wikileaks is a valid blockchain use case but paying for a burger isn't.
Besides a typical burger bought via bitcoin is immediately converted into fiat by the vast majority of merchants. So you guys aren't really spending bitcoin you just create sell pressure for bitcoin.
I can tell you are sincere in your concerns but please open your eyes because the ones orchestrating this r/btc BU attack on bitcoin have a vested interest in killing decentralisation and destroying censorship resistance. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 12:30:00
problem is that r/btc dismisses anyone that didn't actively speak out against the censorship on r/bitcoin. so even people like nick szabo or organisations like bitfury are no longer relevant to them. Whatever they say is immediately downvoted into oblivion by the vote brigadiers (censorship) on r/btc.
At this point virtually anyone worth it's salt in bitcoin has spoken out against BU and especially EC.
At some point you have to consider the notion that maybe roger ver etc are clueless or worse malicious.

The network can only be valuable long term if we figure out how to make mining profitable in a (near) 0 block reward environment. 
In such an environment miners need full blocks and a constant backlog to reliably predict fee income because that is all they will have. 
If blocks are not full fees can not be reliably estimated and miners can not make any meaningful cost/income predictions. This would make mining more like gambling instead of a rational business. 
If anyone can come up with a better solution then great but so far full blocks seem to be a necessity.
BU does not address this at all. They just want to kick the can down the road. This makes bitcoin look like a ponzi scheme where it relies on an ever increasing price to stay profitable for miners (until 0 reward doomsday happens). So it looks like they don't see bitcoin as viable long term and are in effect baking an expiry date into the system.
@_date: 2016-01-15 03:54:38

that's just a lie perpetuated by roger ver et al.
Think about it, why would a POW system be used for trivial purchases like that? Is your coffee purchase at risk of being censored, no!

what's interesting is how price immediately reacts to an increase in segwit signalling and that it is the opposite reaction compared to an increase in BU signalling.
This has been happening since signalling started but now it gets more apparent. This might convince more miners to do the right thing and signal for segwit.

nobody denies a blocksize increase is necessary. The battle is between a responsible secure and realistic path forward and a BU core out blocksize increase now at all cost increase

@_date: 2017-03-16 10:34:18
Well, i see much more value in bitcoin then you seem to do. 
I would really urge you to think beyond the present. there is more to bitcoin then merchant adoption and the world buying coffee with bitcoin. 
i will not get into the obvious technical limitations of on chain scaling (at least you admitted that you have no technical understanding of bitcoin;)
However, you are also wrong on the economic side: bitcoin can't and shouldn't compete with paypal and credit cards because realistic people (so not radical idealistic zealots) will shun bitcoin for B2C payments because it is inferior in every possible way for that purpose, compared to CC and paypal. 
i would advise you to look into the second layer applications in development right now. Factom is a nice example or bitfury, symbiont, chain, chromaway, etc take your pick.
They make merchant adoption look like what it is: a side show for idiots.

the confirmation bias is incredibly strong with you. Are you now seriously trying to claim censorship while your post is visible for all to see?
did you even read my comment buddy? If so then answer the question: where would BU be if it couldn't hide behind censorship and conspiracy cop outs to avoid discussing the topic based on merit?
step back for a moment and try to see what is being censored here. In the real world it would be called libel and it is ground for legal action. People can't just lie or make baseless claims about AXA, NWO bilderberg and all that nonsense and expect not to be banned from any sub.
r/btc is a coordinated attack on what makes bitcoin valuable. i am going to give you the benefit of the doubt and assume for now that you fell for their conspiracy propaganda.

Ethereum might not have started out as a scam but if you fail to deliver as spectacularly as ethereum did then they definitely are one now.
The article doesn't even mention the biggest part of the scam: You only need ether to buy gas. Gas needs to be cheap so ethereum is better of with a low ether price. The market gets this and that's why ethereum is still nearly 90% down from ATH.
You could write a bible sized book about all the scammy things ethereum central management has done. What happened to the promise to never have more then 100M ETH? We are now closing in on 110M ETH!
ethereum central management also lack a moral compass. Comes in handy for guilt free scamming and sucking up to every autocrat that lets them.
It does not matter what they set out to do originally. Currently ethereum are the biggest enemy of the crypto revolution. they are wolves in sheep's clothing. Ethereum is now governed by greed and only exists to serve the corporatocracy.

Their way of doing it is definitely spammy. 
Komodo offers the same service with 1 tx per block. Just like every other proof of immutability as a service company needs only 1 tx per block. Only jeff garzik's clown car company needs a ridiculous amount of blockspace to proof immutability. That's not suspicious at all;/
Veriblok's USP is that you can use it to spam bitcoin to then turn around and say: bitcoin is too expensive, buy my shitcoin instead! All you have to do is pump the price of veriblok so that more of veribloc's pop miners are willing to pay a higher btc tx fee.
I guess, if the veribloc's price goes high enough bitcoin miners could censor pop miners and mine the veriblok reward themselves.

no i am saying that companies like bitpesa have trouble selling the remittance bitcoins on their local markets. 
bitpesa can't send the bitcoins abroad and sell them on an exchange. They need to convert those bitcoins for local currency because they pay out the remittance in local currency.

But none of that matters to the bcrash crowd. They just want to buy coffee with bitcoin and are fine if that means sacrificing immutability and censorship resistance.

why don't you just open a bank account in china and connect it to OKcoin or huobi? Opening a bank account in china is super easy for non residents.
Then you can buy bitcoins in the U.S., send them to okcoin, sell, transfer yuan to your chinese bank account and pay your suppliers from within china, instant and free!  In fact, you will usually make a profit on the spread.

Unfortunately i think they are achieving their goal of amassing as many bitcoins as possible.
They know exactly when the drama starts and stops so they get to short and long accordingly, before anyone else.
Then there was the altcoin bubble which was ignited by the blocksize war. Again, a war they perpetuated and controlled.

probably because in the long run tps is not as important as the total value being transacted (on and off chain).
paying for a single coffee on chain is idiotic so any fee is too high but if a second layer can bundle a million coffee purchases into 1 on chain transaction then the miner fee can and will be substantially higher. That's why scarcity is so important and a reckless blocksize increase is suicide.

*The website promotes an offer to create “an extra record (elsewhere) that [...] is stored in a blockchain, meaning that it is super secure and impossible to forge or tamper with (even by Bitland). You could say that it becomes written in stone,” the service explains.*
none of what they claim would be possible without the bitcoin blockchain and that's why they use it. Pretty rude to not give credit where credit is due

"Only bitcoin is pure digital gold… and I totally buy into that. All the others tend to give up some of the aspects of bitcoin. For example, being totally decentralized and having no central control. That's the first one they have to give up to try to have a business model."

Mining centralization is just a phase. 
With samsung, GMO, Halong etc entering the ASIC game, bitmain's power is waning and ASICs will soon be commoditized. An ASIC's planned obsolescence will be long enough to make even the most remote areas feasible for bitcoin mining.
Soon places like Greenland (and any other cold desolate shit hole with renewable energy capacity) will be begging miners to come and make their renewable energy potential into a money making machine. Bitcoin mining can be to Greenland what oil is to Dubai!

That is actually why i got into bitcoin (the wordpress story) 
Unfortunately i had to accept that the only practical option bitcoin could give the unbanked was to compete with WU with their 10% fees?
That is happening as we speak. 20% of remittances from S.korea to the philippines is using the bitcoin payment rail and it slashes fees from 10 to 3%.
the remittance agents bundle lots of small transactions and use the  blockchain for settlement between them.
It is maybe not exactly what was 'promised' but it is a good first step.
second layers are the realistic way to get the unbanked financially connected. It is what it is, unfortunately.

The question is when do smart contracts benefit from a decentralized architecture? The answer is almost never. Just look at dappradar.com to see the total lack of demand.
So far, the only successful use case was running ICO's. So again: fleecing noobs of their money is the killer app.
The result of all this 'activity' is a totally bloated blockchain. Try and run a full archival ethereum node. You won't be able to do it.
Running a bitcoin full node is cheap and easy. Anyone can do it. This is vital because it safe guards decentralization and it is one of many reasons why ethereum is totally centralised.
Anyway, decentralization was just a buzz word. In the video below you can hear the CEO of the Ethereum enterprise alliance explain how they don't care about decentralization or ether (minute 19 and again around minute 40).
Ethereum is mainly a smooth centrally organised marketing machine.

Immutability is probabilistic. We will never reach 100% immutable but a rational actor will choose the closest thing. Nothing comes close to bitcoin in this field. 
I think making data fraud and corruption proof is a pretty good use case. It sure beats buying coffee;)

An alt coin aspiring to fill that gap will most likely have to compromise on decentralisation. 
You just can't run visa style tx's on chain and be decentralised and censorship resistant.
That's why keeping the base layer lean and mean is so important. An immutable and censorship resistant base layer will give the second layer retail payment projects (thunder, bitcache, LN, etc etc) a chance to compete with the visa's of this world.

Could you explain why you bring gold miners into the mix? Bitcoin miners go to where the electricity is produced. Gold miners have to produce electricity where there is gold in the ground and then they use the electricity (often diesel generated) to pump mercury and other poison into the earth. So i really don't understand how you think gold mining is even in the same environmental league as bitcoin mining.
Poor countries with subsidized electricity are a tiny niche in the mining eco system.  Venezuelan miners still run rigs like the ones  bought out of the KnC miner bankruptcy 4 years ago!!!. If electricity costs 0 then planned obsolescence of the rigs isn't relevant anymore. At 0 per KwH rigs are always profitable but this is obviously a marginal part of the mining eco system.
I am referring to energy without any potential buyers.  This market definitely is one of bitcoin's USP's or do you know another industry that can operate anywhere and be up and running in a matter of weeks?
As an example ca. 40% of global hydro power production is not being used and bitcoin is the only industry that can absorb it. Absorbing this volume would already allow for a $1.000.000 bitcoin price with a marginal environmental impact.
There are many more examples of how bitcoin miners are buyers of last resort. the solar plant that was completed in the Atacama dessert without a grid connection in place for instance. That project would have gone bankrupt if it wasn't for bitcoin miners. They were the only ones able to absorb that supply in short notice. If it wasn't for bitcoin miners that project would have been sold for pennies to the $, probably to the corrupt officials that made sure the grid connection wasn't delivered in time;)
Your assumption that it is hard and expensive to move miners across the planet is flawed. Planned obsolescence for mining rigs went from 3 months in 2014 to 3 years in 2019. This makes shipping mining rigs always possible and cheap. This is not exactly the case for transporting electricity.  
your u/greengenerosity name suggests that you think all energy consumption is despicable. If that's the case then we have to agree to disagree;)

They are thinking like penny stock pumpers. They thrive in a small illiquid market where they can create the movements and front run them.
If bitcoin makes it into the mainstream their role is over. Destroying bitcoin in favour of the alt of the month is how they will survive and thrive.
evoorhees and shapeshift is a great example. No explanation needed.
bitmain would be toast if bitcoin reaches a big enough market cap for AMD and Nvidia to enter.
Coinbase will be obsolete if bitcoin's can be bought and stored at your local bank.
TLDR: Most of the NYA backers have motive to destroy bitcoin. Just look at u/fatassdab he openly admits that he needs bitcoin to die so his alts can rise. These are the type of people backing the NYA.

Use cases like the one above. For proof of immutability bitcoin is the only game in town.
proof of immutability can be used to eradicate pesky little nuisances like say, global corruption and fraud.

@_date: 2017-11-11 15:56:53
by spamming the chain they increase the fees for everybody else.
so instead of $0.5 they now have people paying $5. that extra profit most likely outweighs the costs.
On top of that they get to pump their shitcoin of the month through their 'high fees broke bitcoin' narrative.
Fortunately, this is just a phase. Miner commoditization is around the corner and this will break the mining cartel.
What politicians like roger ver don't get is that this is not an election. You can fool people long enough to win an election but you can't fool people all the time into adopting inferior tech.
As long as bitcoin survives it will eventually rise again. It is the only coin that is staying true to crypto's unique selling points: censorship resistance and immutability through decentralisation. That's why the defeat of the 2x attack is a huge win long term.
The blockchain that takes this type of traffic will win the store of value race.

I think that would be too risky and costly to be rational.
My bet is that they have no intention of letting 2x succeed. They just want to create maximum fud in order to accumulate more real bitcoin.
WCS is if they want 2x to succeed. That would mean to me that they want to kill bitcoin in favour of ethereum/dash/zcash, etc etc.
Most of the companies backing the NYA have a very limited lifespan if bitcoin actually goes mainstream. Those companies are better of as a big fish in a small pond then as a tiny fish in the ocean.
Bitpay, shapeshift, coinbase, bitmain and virtually all of the other nya backers stand to lose by bitcoin's rise. They are better off if crypto stays small and fragmented.
Just a few examples: would people keep using coinbase if they can just buy and store bitcoin at their bank?
Or what happens if bitcoin reaches a high enough market cap for AMD or nvidia to get in the asics game? Bitmain would be toast. Bitmain is better of if bitcoin is destroyed and everybody starts mining dash or zcash.

Mining centralization is just a temporary state. Other much larger players are gearing up to compete with bitmain and the rise of renewable energy will make many more locations suitable for large scale mining.

lol instead of repeating empty buzz lines from r/btc you should do some research.
LN is build to run behind tor. Anyone can set up a hub and make money of LN hopping fees. LN gives true meaning to the phrase 'be your own bank'. Bitcoin in it's present state is just 'hold your own wallet'
How do those characteristics equate to central banking? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:34:29
unfortunately, the technical reality and what bitcoin was 'supposed' to be according to some do not align.
venezuelans won't be affected by $100 fees. Most bitcoin entering venezuela comes from mining. It is trivial for a mining pool to send bitcoin via something like thunder, bitcache,LN etc etc instead of on chain. So these small amounts will keep moving on the second layer and only batched tx's get settled on the main chain at the high fee.
anyway, Bitcoin holds far more value for the everyman because of it's bottom up accountability properties.
Georgia and Ukraine a.o are in the process of anchoring their state operations to the bitcoin blockchain. 
This has the potential to eradicate fraud and corruption on a government level. I think this has a profound impact on people's lives. Much more so than being able to make on chain coffee payments. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:39:51
well, did you ever consider the notion that everybody can use it as they see fit. The fee market will decide who keeps using it and who moves on to another chain.
Things like this don't mind paying a $1000 fee. 
Bitcoin's proposition as a store of value benefits greatly from projects like land registry security. Buying coffee on chain is just pointless compared to use cases like this.
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:12:19
In case of bitpay, I hope so.
Bcash and Bitpay are a match made in heaven. Bitpay was already struggling long before the fees became high. 
They failed to understand that most people don't buy bitcoin to spend it. Spending bitcoin is fun for early adopters but pointless for the majority. 
Now bitpay is just using high fees as an excuse for their failed business model. 
Bcash will prove that bitpay didn't fail because of high fees but because of a one trick pony business model.
This will prove that retail payments are a sideshow at best.

dude I am just stating facts and I have been pushing the 'narrative' below for 2 years now.
 one of bitcoin's unique selling points is the fact that it is able to consume an unlimited amount of energy on a planet which has dramatically misallocated renewable energy resources. POW is the only industry that can operate anywhere, all that matters is cost of electricity.

Check my account age. I am well passed being in it for the money. You don't know me so don't make assumptions about my motivations.
The world is bigger then Deutschland. The majority of the global population does not live under a trustworthy regime like you. The CCP, for instance, will move to pure digital money within the next 5 years and that will definitely be a prison coin. The CCP already bans Chinese people from traveling if they say things the CCP does not like. Without physical cash they can just switch of your money completely if you dare go against the party line. Nothing but bitcoin will be able to help you in such a scenario. Bitcoin is not meant to replace fiat it is meant as the last line of defense against such an Orwellian future.
Nobody in their right mind is advocating for the world to adopt bitcoin and abandon fiat money completely. That's just you making simplistic assumptions. Bitcoin is here to keep governments in check and provide an escape for totalitarian regimes like the CCP going full on Orwellian.
You as a German or Austrian (whatever) should know how fast things can turn into an unsafe place. Did you learn nothing from the Weimar republic, Hitler and the NSDAP? You are the insane one if you don't get this.

you do realize that every blockchain will run into the same problems should they ever experience any heavy load.

High fees are necessary! How do you suppose a blockchain survives in a near 0 block reward environment? Do you think miners would just keep on securing the network out of altruism?

From an environmental view point bitcoin is way more sustainable then tesla and ethereum. Elon can be forgiven for not grasping this yet. 
Vitalik should know better. He peddles the idea that POS' main virtue over POW is the environment. vitalik is obviously wrong because one of bitcoin's unique selling points is the fact that it is able to consume an unlimited amount of energy on a planet which has dramatically misallocated renewable energy resources. POW is the only industry that can operate anywhere, all that matters is cost of electricity. Because of this POW can give the geographically disenfranchised a chance to compete on the global market place by utilizing energy which they could not transport/sell before bitcoin came along. Today, we have babushkas in Siberia supporting their pensions via bitcoin mining. Who knows who will benefit next. We are merely minding the cradle of this new asset class and energy consumption is one of it's unique selling points. The fact that most people see energy consumption as a disadvantage makes me incredibly bullish on bitcoin long term.
Anyway, to me POS vs POW is not a technological but an ideological matter.
POS is rent seeking. It would turn the crypto revolution in yet another 'poor yield to the rich' scheme ran by the new version of the same cabal that's running things now.
POW rewards the every man going the extra mile, literally. If you are willing and able to set up shop in some remote place like kazachstan, iran, greenland and many more places few people would like to live, then you can make bank mining bitcoin even below $1000.
over 80% of bitcoin mining is using renewable energy. No other industry comes close to this %

Some people sure but it is a small minority. Libertarianism is a fringe ideology because most people (including bitcoiners) realize it is basically just a fancy word selfish bastards use to sleep well at night.
On the other hand, a government can only function if there are checks and balances. In the digital age free money like bitcoin adds an escape valve should a government go Orwellian like the CCP is doing right now in china and every other country that lets them in. 
~~If~~ When physical money gets abolished it is good to have the choice between freedom coin (bitcoin) and prison coin (digital fiat). It will keep governments from getting to 'ambitious' in micro managing their populations.

BlockFi is just a company if it implodes tomorrow bitcoin would just carry on. It is **optional**. Same goes for LN, Liquid, iBTC, etc. Whatever happens to those things will not affect the base layer.
ETH 2.0 POS needs stakers to secure the 64 or 1024 shards (Vitalik, the glorious leader, hasn't decided yet;) It is **mandatory** and it's failure would destroy ethereum 2.0.
Not to worry though, Ethereum central management would just launch another conceptual rube goldberg machine called ETH 3.0.

Bitcoin as money is just one app. Personally I find bitcoin as the trust and truth machine a more interesting use case and that's what the second layers below are using it for.
Things like [exonum.com]( and [chainpoint.org]( build on top of bitcoin to prove their data is tamper proof. They anchor loads of data to the bitcoin blockchain with just one on chain tx. They are second layers.
Even microsoft's identity system build on bitcoin can be considered a second layer to bitcoin. [
Ironically, Ethereum and EOS are turning into second layers for bitcoin as well. Tons of BTC locked up in EOS smart contracts and makerDAO is drooling over bitcoin being added as a collateral option in DeFi. iBTC is one example already running in production but more decentralized options are coming.

projects that don't make it their USP to trash bitcoin and actually deliver some sort of value are fine by me. So Litecoin, monero and grin are OK.
It's projects like nano, iota, ethereum and bcash that get on my nerves. they intentionally simplify complex issues to sell their coin to the uninformed. 
They are scammers so no mercy for them and they need to be called out. Just think of all the people who lost their shirt in some ethereum ICO or the poor souls that got tricked into thinking bcash was the real bitcoin.
It's our duty as a community to call out scammers. There are 7129 scam coins and counting. Every casual investor we can save from losing their money on a scam is one potential extra hard money bitcoin supporter

I agree with you 100% but this is not the mindset of our opponents.
They are thinking like penny stock pumpers. They thrive in a small illiquid market where they can create the movements and front run them.
If bitcoin makes it into the mainstream their role is over. Destroying bitcoin in favour of the alt of the month is how they will survive and thrive.
u/evoorhees and shapeshift is a great example. No explanation needed.
bitmain would be toast if bitcoin reaches a big enough market cap for AMD and Nvidia to enter. 
Coinbase will be obsolete if bitcoin's can be bought and stored at your local bank. 
TLDR: Most of the NYA backers have motive to destroy bitcoin. Just look at u/fatassdab he openly admits that he needs bitcoin to die so his alts can rise. These are the type of people backing the NYA.

personally, I have an ideological problem with POS in general. They are rent seeking attempts. Poor yield to the rich schemes for the digital age. POS rewards doing nothing but voting according to the party line.
POW rewards work and literally going the extra mile. If you are willing to set up shop in some desolate region that happens to have abundant Geo-thermal or hydro power then you will make money. POW can do to places like Greenland what oil did to Dubai.
Not really familiar with cardano. it's like 3 companies running it with a ~~charismatic leader~~ narcissist with delusions of grandeur at the helm. As with all alts, it's pretty clear whose heads need guns pointing at it to control that chain;) 
Investment wise aren't all these things ultimately utility tokens and they are only needed to power their smart contracts? There are so many smart contract platforms that they will be getting into a race to the bottom eventually. No need for these tokens to have a high price. Cheaper might even be better.
Those kind of platforms might have a future as a second layer to bitcoin. EOS and Ethereum already have tons of bitcoin locked up in smart contracts. Those chains take all the centralizing load while bitcoin hodlers have the option to use their DeFi, games, etc. The bitcoin base layer stays nimble and secure while bitcoiners get to enjoy all the same functionality. Just go to the makerdao sub and see them drool over ways of adding bitcoin as a collateral option. It's pretty ironic how these platforms are actually helping bitcoin scale.
If bitcoin fails the entire eco system fails. If any of the 7000+ alts fail nobody will care;)

In case of mass adoption the cost of running such nodes would dwarf the cc costs these small merchants have. a pure payment coin like nano would need mass adoption or else the volatility and slippage would make any payment a total headache for merchants and consumers alike. Then there is the accounting nightmare because every payment is a CGT event. 
These are just a few of the many reasons why a company like bitpay has been struggling long before the bitcoin fees went up. High fees were just a convenient excuse for bitpay. their ill thought out business plan was doomed from the start.
Try to think like a rational person who isn't a fan of bitcoin or nano. Why would such a person first buy bitcoin/nano to then spend it on things he/she could have used the fiat for in the first place? They would pay more (exchange fees) to get less (airmiles, cashbacks, dispute resolution, insurance, etc etc).Telling people that bitcoin is meant for this makes the entire community look like fools.
P2P cash means censorship resistant money beyond the control of governments. To use such a powerful tool for purchases that don't run the risk of being censored or reversed is just pointless
Meanwhile bitcoin is used to fight fraud and corruption but nobody ever talks about that because bitcoin is supposed to be paypal or else it failed.
 secures the land registry of Georgia via bitcoin among many other things.  has many paying customers and they assure tamper proof data via the bitcoin blockchain. This is way more interesting then bitcoin as paypal.It's these type of use cases that will cement bitcoin's position as digital gold.

considering how exchanges will be able to onboard thousands onto lightning with just one onchain TX the fees can easily go into hundreds of $ without affecting the user experience of retail users.
Then there is the Immutability as a service industry. They can secure virtually unlimited amounts of data with just one tx. thousands of $ would still be cheap to them. [ is a great example of this system.
Bitcoin is scaling in many different ways and they all allow for very high on chain tx fees without burdening the cost onto single users.

PayPal has instant transactions as well.
Nano can only scale by centralising. Should nano ever get any sort of adoption then a few corporate nodes will run it and you would just have to trust those entities to not censor or reverse your tx. Free transactions also leave the incentive alignment issue unsolved.

  [Salmondish]( points·[6 days ago](
These numbers do not takes into account --
Malicious miners and transactions which would demand more CPU/RAM to validate. The paper you cite does not take into account attack scenarios
Block propagation latency causing centralization of mining
Running a node over TOR for privacy
Syncing a node from a satellite in locations without fast internet
You also assume that everyone in the world has access to fast bandwidth like in major cities in Germany. Nielson's law doesn't apply to every location and doesn't take into account soft caps and bandwidth limits.
Bandwidth required is actually much higher when nodes are not cooperating during certain types of sybil attacks
1GB blocks would require a raid array of ssd drives , not regular HDD, thus your math is wrong here too. 127MB/s sequentially is not going to cut it
Moore's law does not assume the prices of CPUs half every 2 years, Moore's law is not even keeping true these days in regards to transistor count and price and performance are different matters entirely
I could go on, but there are so many inaccuracies and flawed assumptions in your post that it is better you start over by doing some better research on your own.
  
[capn\_hector]( points·[6 days ago]( 6 days ago*
Blocks don’t come in at an average rate, everyone tries to pull in the block as fast as possible after it's released, gig at a time. That changes the billing somewhat, most DCs charge at like 95th percentile usages, so if you are pulling in at say 100 mbit/s for 5% of the time, you would be billed 100 mbit/s, not 2 mbit.
Also, the fact that blocks are so large would lead to a huge increase in uncles and small-depth reorgs due to increased propagation time, so you will want to wait longer for blocks to finalize. At a conceptual level, this is a straightforward trade of throughout for latency.
This will increase bandwidth consumption as well, since you will have to download those reorged chains too. And larger nodes will have to push those GB blocks to smaller nodes as well.
It also creates a perverse incentive for dishonest miners to work on private chains, since they already have an advantage of several minutes before the block propagates to the average node.
Finally, at 1 GB per block, you are now filling an 8TB drive every 51 days, and you can only fit about 12 drives per rack unit *at best*, so you are adding a rack unit every year and a half as well. And god help you if you need to cold-start a node, you are going to be downloading literally hundreds of terabytes before too many years go by. That’s not going to happen outside of a data center, and even smaller data centers are not going to be happy with you monopolizing a fast pipe for months on end (and you will certainly pay for it).
I get that it’s an extreme example, but while maybe 8-32 MB are perfectly viable, 1 GB is definitely not a good idea.
@_date: 2019-04-13 16:48:53
Will you still run a full bch node if it means having to upload minimum 5gb every 10 minutes? You would need a pretty fast internet connection.

I actually think that the extreme focus on bitcoin as paypal is preventing people from appreciating bitcoin's primary qualities.
To me it is primarily an immutable ledger which you can use to prove data integrity. I also appreciate bitcoin as a sovereign store of value and value transfer system.
The 3 use cases above can thrive when fees reach $100+. Buying breakfast is just not a good idea. You spend way to much resources (electricity, hardware depreciation, etc) for such a tiny transaction.

Only large corps would run a node in this ideal nano world you describe.  Bandwidth requirements would exclude the private user. Nano would just create a new type of bank. Your tx could be censored by these new corp banks and we would be back at square 1.
 This is why bitcoin blocks are kept small and volume is offloaded to second layers like lightning which scales a lot better then nano and adds privacy beyond what even privacy coins can offer.
But hey, as long as nobody uses nano they can keep the lies going.

 Nano is a centralised fin tech company competing with paypal. It just pretends to be similar to bitcoin to trick uninformed people out of their money.
5 staking nodes control over 51% of nano voting power. All these nodes had to doxx themselves because the nano users don't trust anonymous nodes with their coins.
If the 5 nodes that control nano decide to censor or reverse transactions then all the nano users can do is point their coins to another node. There is no ~~other~~ way to penalize rogue nodes.
So if the known nodes that control nano get a court order telling them to censor or reverse transactions then these companies will all comply because the penalty of not complying with a court order is way more costly then just screwing over the nano users.

Does the merchant keep the btc or does it get converted to fiat via something like bitpay. Almost all merchants immediately convert to fiat (market selling) for accounting/tax purposes.
I Agree that bitcoin's value comes from it's use cases but the bitcoin as paypal use case is pretty pointless.
Bitcoin is useful when your transaction would normally be censored. So donating to wikileaks makes sense, buying coffee does not.
Bitcoin as paypal has been failing since 2012, long before the fees went up. It turns out that people just don't buy something that they expect to go up in value to then turn around and sell it for something they could have bought with a credit card.

Bitcoin is more then money, it's just the first application of this tech. 
The future of crypto is in proof of ownership, time, creation, etc etc
Currently there are 4 land registry pilot projects running and they all anchor their data on to the bitcoin blockchain.
The 4 are Honduras (Factom), Ghana (Bitland), Sweden (Chromaway) and The Republic of Georgia (Bitfury)
When blockchain based land registry protection takes of it will also galvanize bitcoin as a store of value. There is no telling what that can do to the price.

Unfortunately I am a tech noob so I don't know why they (officially) do it.
I do know that it is not wasteful if you want to pump shit coins. Congesting the bitcoin blockchain is essential for a serious pump.
They recommend miners to not do more then 1 bitcoin tx every 3 minutes which is an insane amount. One of their tx' is ca. 300 bytes. The amount of miners and fees paid should grow with the veriblock price.
Doesn't this make it easy for an attacker to congest bitcoin by pumping veriblock?

It is not meant to replace the centralised systems in place. it is an extra security feature. 
Just because a government wants a fraud free land registry doesn't mean it can trust it's civil servants and notaries to do an honest job.
This is where a decentralised blockchain comes in handy. It makes it impossible for people within the state to commit fraud and this will greatly benefit the appeal of such a country to the mainstream real estate investor.

A vital characteristic which sets bitcoin mining apart from every other industry is the fact that Bitcoin miners can  operate anywhere on the planet.  So bitcoin miners do not create extra electricity demand but they just go to locations with electricity overproduction. Bitcoin price would have to go to like $1000.000 to make absorbing all the global electricity over production feasible.

It's not just a currency. That's maybe 5% of the speculative value.
It's only useful as a payment system when your tx runs the risk of being reversed or censored. Almost everything else is just selling bitcoin for fiat via the purchase of goods and services.
The use cases below are far more interesting and they will galvanize bitcoin's appeal as a store of value.

This idea you have that bitcoin is being transformed into a settlement system for banks is just wrong. 
i recommend you have a look at companies such as Bitland, Factom, Chromaway and Bitfury. They are all engaged in pilot projects where they use the bitcoin blockchain to secure the land registry of a country. 
This type of settlement will greatly benefit ordinary people in developing countries.  
settlement is the future and it can come in many forms. Everything that needs proof of ownership, time, existence, authenticity, etc can use the bitcoin blockchain as a tool to provide  this ultimate proof .
You dismissing all this as just a settlement system for banks is very unfair to all the people actually working towards this goal.
bitcoin is just not so well suited as a payment system and most people don't want to use it for that anyway. Sorry but get over it!
You are wrong and very dogmatic about it.

This was never the sole purpose. Retail payments were just the first application, a proof of concept. Some vocal fools, like roger ver, are just to stubborn to accept this.

So after 4 years Kevin Dowd still does not understand that miners have virtually no power. Nodes have to go along with whatever miners want or it will not happen (see segwit2x and UASF). This constant tug of war is a vital part of bitcoin’s game theory.
Mining used to be centralised in china because miners needed to be as close to the ASIC manufacturers as possible. Now all that matters is the electricity cost. This is why mining has gone global and is getting more decentralized (Again, miner decentralization does not really matter because of the power nodes have but still).
Kevin’s second argument is even weaker. Censorship resistance and immutability through decentralization is what gives a crypto value and nothing else.
Every crypto after bitcoin will be more centralised (and therefore inferior to bitcoin) because it was born out of greed. Those greedy people do not do a satoshi and disappear but instead they seek to strengthen their own position through scams like POS, pre-mines or insta-mines. Alt coins call those scams innovation to fool people like Kevin.
Fact is that over 6400 different alt coins have been released and over 4400 of those coins have already died! Kevin still does not get why those coins die and bitcoin survives. It’s because the tech is not what sets bitcoin apart from all these centralised P&amp;D schemes pretending to be a bitcoin competitor. It’s the game theory, stupid!

The goal is to use them in your everyday life to buy things and pay bills.

Bitcoin is being primed to become the universal ledger of trust. It enables value transfer (anything that has value) without having to trust anyone.
Check companies like tierion, bitfury, chromaway, filament, factom, etc etc.
They all use the bitcoin blockchain for proof of immutability.
Bitfury, for instance, has already finished a pilot project with the republic of georgia which will result in bitfury using the bitcoin blockchain to secure the entire land registry of Georgia.

Youtube videos pumping iota don't prove anything. You just made my point.
The iota trade off is the closed source coordinator! that and their general 'just trust us' attitude should ring plenty of alarm bells because it goes against the essence of FOSS.
Still, I wish iota all the best because I am a hodler since $0.18 but they do not take any load of the bitcoin blockchain at this stage.
I also think iota's fair price at this point is around $0.2. They are years from actual production ready use cases. They tend to wildly exaggerate their 'partnerships'. Notice how all the partnership announcements come from iota but are not backed up by their alleged 'partners'. 
Maybe bosch does not regard you as a partner when all you do is rent an office in a chicago incubator sponsored by bosch.

After renting some office space you should buy a bosch sensor and code something on top of it. Once you have done those 2 things you are at the same 'partnership' level as iota is today.

As somebody that meddles in renewable energy projects i think bitcoin mining is the best thing that could have happened to the renewable energy industry. 
bitcoin mining can make renewable projects viable from day 1. it no longer matters if the grid is already connected to a renewable energy plant. bitcoin miners can set up shop in a matter of weeks. We can already see pow miners actively scanning renewable projects set to come online with sub par grid connections.
Further ahead i can see some of the most poor desolate remote places being turned into the dubai of the arctic thanks to bitcoin mining. Areas that would never be able to get a grid connection can now utilize their renewable energy sources for bitcoin mining and make a tax killing for the local population.
This sounds a lot better then POS which ultimately boils down to 'the poor yield to the rich' in the digital age. If energy use really is the only argument against pow and for pos then forget about it.

Barry pretends not to realize that not mentioning those things constitute big enough changes to withdraw from the NYA.
Barry even has the nerve to shift blame to waylon coins because his poorly worded agreement still does not officially mention those crucial parts.

Retail payments are just one use case. For bitcoin it was a proof of concept use case. personally I am much more impressed with things like this.
Projects like this do not care about a $5 fee. They could handle fees in the thousands of $ and it would work fine. Better actually because  if bitcoin can demand $1000 fees it secures the survival of the network in a 0 block reward environment. 
What do you think will happen to bitcoin's proposition as a store of value when people realize bitcoin is used to secure the property stock of entire nations? Bitcoin makes land registry fraud virtually impossible. As someone coming from real estate I can not stress enough how big an accomplishment that is.
Lightning, thunder, bitcache, etc will be able to handle micro payments on the second layer. 
Censorship resistance, immutability and decentralisation are the unique selling points. It would be short sighted to sacrifice those things in favour of cheaper tx fees.
Regarding IOTA: we will see if it still works without the coordinator.

google, like facebook, is a great example of how we came to regret having a few people in control of something so powerful.

because there are a ton of second layer solutions out there who all need segwit to be implemented. They will allow bitcoin to scale to the levels needed to realize your dream.
no blocksize will ever be big enough to cater to your vision for bitcoin. 
Besides, a blocksize increase will have to happen down the road but the question is do we do it responsibly and safely or do we go YOLO let's just BU fork and see what happens (look what happened to BU nodes today, again!)
BU proves there is no safe blocksize increasing implementation production ready. 
so if you want to wait another 2 years for something which will never happen then you are betting on the right horse with your simplistic blocksize increase demand.
Typical how it is alt pumpers who seem to want this kicking the can down the road strategy for bitcoin

Semantics aside: segwit does allow for 1000x scaling as opposed to a blocksize increase which is just linear scaling without eliminating the associated risks.
on chain scaling is a simplistic kicking the can down the road strategy and should be considered only after segwit and it's related second layer solutions are implemented.
How big do blocks have to get for mass adoption to be feasible?
1 Terabyte will be too low so what good is on chain scaling if there will never be an end to the blocksize we need?
on chain scaling will turn bitcoin into paypal coin though so if you want to kill bitcoin's value proposition then you should support on chain scaling.

People want vice but that doesn't mean they want to be associated with it.  is doing a good job making bitcoin look like the official currency of vice.

bitcoin does not need to be feasible on a large scale.
it needs to be feasible when there is a threat of censorship. That's one of bitcoin's strongest unique selling points.
All your coffee buying needs can be handled on second layers but the core protocol needs to be beyond the control of anyone.
that's why it is so important that nodes are nimble enough to run behind TOR.
LN second layer can also run behind TOR. 
Why give up this protective shield to make on chain transactions that no one wants to censor?

According to Bitcoinbelle
JVP sat on a panel with wright. Afterwards, he was explicitly asked if CSW was Satoshi and he said NO.
But now all of a sudden he claims to have met him in 2005 where CSW made a massive impression on him. 
Sure sounds plausible.
Bitcoinbelle is one of these people who are just to honest for their own good so i take her word over JSV and CSW any day

it's backed by the strongest computer network in the world but it is beyond the control of anyone. 
So, it can't be manipulated or diluted. It also can't be censored so capital controls etc mean nothing if you hold bitcoin. 
wikileaks is a prime example of the benefits bitcoin's censorship resistance creates: wikileaks would no longer exist if it wasn't for them being able to receive donations in bitcoin.

i really want to see BCC die!
That's why i think it is important that as many people as possible claim their BCC's. If we don't then who is going to dump that shitcoin to the core?
If we don't claim those BCC's the supply will be limited which will make it easier for vermin and co to turn it into a P&amp;D coin.
I was hoping bfx, stamp etc would allow us to withdraw BCC but not trade it. That way everybody will send their BCC's to the few exchanges that do offer it and then the dump will be unstoppable and unrecoverable.
@_date: 2019-05-13 10:37:46
A sovereign store of value. So a practical, digital version of gold.
Bitcoin won't get there by pretending to be paypal.
What would improve bitcoin's appeal as a SOV would be the proof of immutability application. So countries securing their land registry via the bitcoin blockchain would increase bitcoin's appeal as a SOV. luckily for us bitcoiners, it is already used for this;)
 [ 
Making data tamper proof is a huge selling point for bitcoin. It can help make data (and people) fraud and corruption resistant. 
 [ 
I think Proof of data integrity is a more attractive selling point then being able to buy coffee.
You are right that spending bitcoin on products that don't run the risk of being censored or reversed is fun but it is important to acknowledge that this is not bitcoin's end goal. It is merely a proof of concept use case.

The general public has a serious short medium term memory issue. 
The 2013 hype cycle was pretty intense as well but it did not stick around in your brain because YOU didn't buy any bitcoin back then . The same applies to the people that did not buy in the 2017 hype cycle. To them bitcoin will just be a vague memory of something going up really really fast and some will buy bitcoin because if it starts going up....
@_date: 2019-05-14 07:34:46
on chain, bitcoin can never be a paypal competitor. It's mathematically impossible without centralizing the network.

If you want to pump a coin then low fees are a great tool to trick noobs into losing their money on a shitcoin.

Sure go for it. Anyone can use bitcoin as they see fit. The fee market will decide if it make sense. Just be aware that merchant adoption has been tried since 2012 and it failed long before the fees went high.
Rational people keep asking themselves: Whats the point of it?
Currently merchants are forced to immediately convert to fiat for accounting purposes. so bitpay, coinbase, Gemini, etc are market selling bitcoin on your behalf.
Banks are fine with this type of merchant adoption because the money stays in the fiat system and banks make money on your fiat to bitcoin to fiat (via the purchase of goods and services) conversions.
Now, if you just hodl bitcoin then the banks do have a problem. Fractional reserve banking would come crashing down when just 5% of the people withdraw from the fiat system and store their wealth in bitcoin. Spending your bitcoin on things that don't run the risk of being censored of reversed does not aid that goal.
@_date: 2017-06-12 10:27:56

You are right, fees are insane.
On chain fees are too low and need to rise exponentially! 
Tough on the people that were misinformed into thinking that buying coffee on chain is a valid use case (it isn't) but we have plenty of other use cases left beyond digital gold.

Because of batching it is not clear how many tx are being processed daily. The upper limit is over 4.000.000 tx a day instead of 260.000
Send in $ is a much more interesting metric. The 2015 average will be around $200M. The 2018 average will be around $10B so a ca. 50x increase in $ send per day.
