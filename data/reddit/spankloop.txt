No, she did not.

I agree. I think the question of why one should use bitcoin over visa or venmo is a pretty broad question though. I think it requires a discussion of the benefits of cryptocurrency in general. This is a really intricate topic and there's a lot to cover. Regardless though, that isn't necessarily a reason to avoid the question.

Could you describe how block size and centralization are directly related? I'd love to know more. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:37:28
Yeah, I would have liked to have seen that question answered. Could someone answer this here? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:03:53
Yeah, I agree.

I agree that it is great seeing a woman represent Bitcoin. Your comment reminds me of the following tweet by Michael Novogratz:  I agree with him completely. 
Edit: The tweet reads "It feels to me that 85% of the crypto community is male. for the revolution to thrive we need more women on the team. i know its a complex issue but change starts with awareness.

I thought that one of the analogies that Stark gave was pretty interesting. Stark described an increase in block size as increasing lanes in a road to ease congestion/traffic whereas using the lightning network is essentially teleportation.   
Edit: Just to hijack this comment, I apologise as the title of the post is slightly misleading. As pointed out below, Elizabeth Stark is CEO and Co-Founder of Lightning Labs, Lightning (Network) is the protocol.

That's another way to put it, haha. I must admit my technical knowledge of blockchain isn't deep enough to fully contribute to the debate around increasing block size. Nevertheless, from my current knowledge and drawing upon that of "experts", it seems that the lightning network could alleviate many of the current issues.

Thanks for clarifying.

This is a really interesting comment. Thanks for sharing the link to your post. I'll definitely look into it some more.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:10:19
Haha, definitely. Stark is CEO and co-founder.

I'm glad you were able to get the treatment, friend. I'm from Kurdistan but I'm living abroad. Could I ask how you bought/sold cryptocurrencies in Kurdistan? What services/exchanges etc. do you use? Thank you
