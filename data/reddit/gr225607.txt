Why not use Quadriga CX (in BC Canada) they have better fees - free withdrawal and deposits and lower than Coinbase buy fees (  )

Ya, looks cool too, similar to BitWasp. But, how is this decentralized, isn't it run from a server. I'm probably mixing up my peer-to-peer and decentralized terms.
... Okay reading some of the articles at the bottom, very technical, I'll read it later, but seems decentralized and web based! Cool!
@_date: 2014-07-10 18:06:24
Wow! Cool! That should do the trick. I'll look a lot closer at it soon :)

I think I found the answer ["With Bitcoins: Provide your Bitcoin address and the Bitcoins will be paid out to you. The exchange rate of Euros to Bitcoins on the payment date will be applicable. As soon as we have transferred the payment the amount will be available to you in Bitcoins." ](
Still, what are your experiences?
@_date: 2016-05-25 18:35:06
Ya, it's super to hear you had a good experience as a user :)
I'm also interested in hearing the experiences of a property owner. I wonder, if the owner can only withdraw BTC if the user paid in BTC, or if all transactions, including fiat, can be converted to BTC for withdrawal. I wonder, because for taxes, I think you only report income when BTC is exchanged to Fiat. So withdrawing and keeping it in BTC could legally control the actual income you have to report for taxes.

Actually, here is the only real place to talk about it 
But I wanted some non bias opinions.

The price went up because the Chinese were buying btc to buy AM shares. The shares were at the lowest point in history. And if you know AMs plans the shares are going to sky rocket. But now that it has started to bull, there won't be as great a need to buy btc, so naturally btc will go down a bit.

Wow, really makes you wonder... Really, what is the big difference between Bitcoin, Fiat money, Gold, Silver, etc... All these currencies will enslave the human race with debt, with the 1% always winning. Think about it. If there is only 1 BTC, dollar, or gold in existence, and you lend it out with a 1.1% return, where does the other .1% come from? Right? (ie. you lend out 21 million Bitcoins at 1.1%, where does the rest come from?) I think the early Christians, (and is it the now Islams?) got it right by not religiously (now it could be morally) allowing  interest on loaned money (you lend someone a dollar but only expect a dollar back).  
Deep, right? (Please excuse my grammar)
