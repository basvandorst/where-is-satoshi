Anyone can contribute to the Github repository, but let's say Gavin for some wild reason decided to push an update that did not have everyone's best interests in mind.
People mining bitcoin would basically fork. They would separate into two groups - one favoring code before the update, and those favoring the code after. They would mine separate blockchains. This acts as a voting mechanism, and you can see real examples of this by looking at altcoins. People had a different vision of what they wanted "Bitcoin" to become, and they created their own "coins".

People hate him because that is the mentality of this sub. There is no proof that he stole anything! I really hope the truth comes out so that people can move on.

Ah yes, just give them the Byzantine General's problem. I also agree that this is a solid approach to people who are moderately intelligent, but have trouble understanding transaction confirmations.

I'm not even going to wake up. How can I sleep with Bitcoin rising?

Why yes, yes I am thank you :)

There is no proof that Mark stole the bitcoins. Blind accusations of him doing this makes you no better than the corrupt judicial system we face today. Hypocrites.

There have been flaws before, and they have been fixed. So, it is absolutely *possible* to update the software.
However, there can be consequences..

Not everyone will agree with this, but in my opinion it is "trickle up". It has been said that "coins flow from weak to strong hands".
