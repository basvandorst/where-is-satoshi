Trade one close environment for another? What's stopping M$ from banning the apps here too? At least with Android you can install 3rd party apps without needing a store.
Some people never learn from past events.

Neither Apple had any interest when it all started. I don't trust Google either to keep the Bitcoin wallets on the play store (especially when they have google wallet, sort of a competing product) but if all goes south I know I can still install the app from other sources.

Actually it's going down for real because Russia is invading Ukraine.

This already happened a few years ago.

Alien invasion. Abandon all hope!

Maybe they will eventually ship. The problem is that others have shipped ahead of them causing the diff to go up. Now it's not a question if you will get yours but rather how much would it take to get a ROI. And this really sucks because people who bought from BFL were betting their money on a few days ROI and a lot of profit. This makes BFL the worst investment ever. They took people's money/btc and managed to break every promise. Maybe mined a few thousand BTC while "testing".

Well.. no worries about Romania.  The government is too retarded and too busy to steal money from its budget. Also the parlament is full with of fat guys wo rised goats and sheep half their life and saw the 1st smarphone/tablet when they were elected. I don't think anyone here would even dream of passing any legislation regarding bitcoin or exchanges (notice the word dream) because they would have to wake up from their sleep ( on their comfortable seats inside the House OF THE PEOPLE).  Also... understanding the term Bitcoin wold take them forever.
P.S. my sarcasm is based on a true story

How about a donation to Unicorn's witnesses? Trolling aside I respect everyone's right to belive in whatever he likes (as long as you let me belive in my Unicorn) but why every church needs money? In my country there are more churches than schools and hospitals. Apparently no God (whatever the name is) is able to handle its finances...

If I would put a miner in someone's server I wouldn't use the name cgminer, minerd, or anything that has miner in its name. To be sure look at the output of top and see if there is any process that uses 100% cpu. Also if that server has ATI graphic cards see the output of aticonfig --adapter=all --odgc and look for the gpu usage percentage. If it's 100% someone is using your GPUs for mining (or something else).

If the current network is ~ 140TH and BFL ships 285TH doesn't that mean BFL is capable of a 51% attack?

I guess you wanted to replay to "Here comes LTC" ... lol

It's ok. System-idle is the cpu power not in use (free). It's a sinonym for unused cpu.

It's Dwolla's who is losing here more than MtGox. The title should be MtGox no longer doing business with Dwolla.
