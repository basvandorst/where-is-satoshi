Need money to invest in bitcoin? How about selling your shoes? We've got a buyer for you right here.

Hahaha! 1) Cash is the most secure? He's never heard about forgery or inflation? 2) 'be cautious, read the fine print' - maybe start by doing that yourself?, 3) 'it's a security, not a currency', legally unclear, and in normal language terms also unclear. Are cigarettes used as money in prisons a currency? According to economics books yes. I can't believe this dinosaur has an important role in our economic system, time for young hackers to take over.

I would like insider trading to be legal. As an investor, this would give me confidence that the stocks are priced based on all available knowledge, and thus fairly. As an investor you are not obliged to buy or sell your stocks. If a bad quarterly result is about to be announced, after the information is traded on, the stock will drop in value. As a normal investor who holds the stock, you will no matter what be hit by this. The only difference is whether it happens earlier because the CEO has started selling some shares, or later when the info is made public and all investors start to value it at less. I would rather see the share drop in price to the fair value earlier, than continue trading at too high value because there is bad information, yet to be released.

Sold one coin last week to buy an Omega watch. Glad I didn't sell a bunch of coins for a sportscar like my good friend did 1 year ago...

I want a world with just one single currency, easy payments and no seignorage, haircuts, or conversion rates. But I don't want a too strong central global government or global reserve bank. Bitcoin is the closest candidate to this dream (functioning as currency, but not transaction system), I will HODL, HODL, HODL, until I spot a better candidate.

:o - that face when you sold some of your bitcoins, but are still happy you have lots of bitcoins.

... basically every economist agrees that countries become wealthier over time if populations and governments save more and spend less. So this is more a positive thing, than negative. Only problem is that governments that want to smooth out business cycles or bail themselves out without declaring bankruptcy, will no longer have the capability to print money for that.
