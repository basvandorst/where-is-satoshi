I agree the WWW isn't secure enough from a bitcoin point of view. My point was simply that people aren't going to be able to use bitcoin on a wide scale (as other users have pointed out) unless some better method is found than sending money to a wallet that is only represented by a long string of digits. Any currency needs to be human-understandable if humans are going to use it on a wide/global scale.

I find this situation analogous to World Wide Web addresses. The WWW wouldn't have taken off if people had had to enter an IP address every time they wanted to visit a site.

I love when a CEO says "My company will never do [X]." Never is a long time, man. And CEOs come and go.

If it's so firmly in the interests of these big exchanges to move to SegWit in terms of lower fees, why do we have to pressure them to do so? Why aren't they doing so of their own accord?

Ah, okay, that makes more sense. Thanks very much for the clarification.

This is something I have trouble wrapping my head around. I understand the concept of a finite number of altcoins and how theoretically that should resolve the inflation/deflation issue experienced by fiat currencies. However, in practice, given that any altcoin is worth whatever the market will bear, isn't it somewhat fallacious to say that an altcoin is immune to inflation/deflation?
I mean, I often hear people say "altcoins are a great store of value compared to fiat currency." But if I have 1 BTC worth $19,000, and the value of 1 BTC drops back to $1.00, then it's essentially the same as if the bitcoin currency experienced huge inflation, isn't it?
That argument presumes fiat still has a role, as an exchanging currency. But even if everything in the world was bought/sold via Bitcoin and there was no more fiat currency, the amount of goods that 1 BTC can buy would still be subject to change, so I'm still not sure how Bitcoin removes inflation/deflation.

Presumably bitcoin would start its life in the "fiat-less world" as being worth whatever the "last fiat equivalent" was. From there, it'll be whatever worth whatever people think it's worth. For instance, if salaries average 100 BTC a month, the price of a car would be something like 1,000 BTC, milk would be a fraction of a BTC, etc. People setting prices for things would be aware of how much BTC people make in a month, how much their costs are in BTC, etc etc. The "value" would set itself over time in terms of "buying power" for actual items.

But that's not what's happening, correct? And I don't see how it can be designed to be one way or the other. Any currency's value is determined by how much people think it's worth. Zimbabwe's currency underwent hyperinflation because no one thought it was worth anything anymore. Bitcoin is undergoing huge deflation because huge numbers of people think it's worth a lot, but if that changed suddenly, and bitcoin crashed down to almost zero, it could swing from deflationary to hyperinflationary in the course of an hour. In other words no matter what the "design" of a currency is, it'll respond to inflation/deflation pressures that are impossible to control and are simply dependent on valuation, isn't that correct?

So you claim it's nonsense, I'm curious what you think is nonsense, then you refuse to provide any evidence at all of what you feel is nonsense, and just want us to take you at your word? OK.

Ah, thanks for the explanation. Geez...when I was a kid, I don't remember this many wingnuts being around :(

OK, I'll bite. Such as....?
