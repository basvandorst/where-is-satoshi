I wouldnt, I hold bitcoin securely because of the properties and upside potential.
But this way people who don't understand bitcoin, or even dont like bitcoin can use its transactional benefits while holding their precious US dollar. 
once they've realised how much they could've made if they simply held onto bitcoin themselves maybe they'll try figure out how to go about that.

@_date: 2014-05-16 02:03:51
its still not a bad thing, if what people want is a way to use bitcoins transactional benefits without the volatility then you don't get rewarded if it goes up, and as you dont lose if it goes down. He is only taking on that risk other people dont want.
