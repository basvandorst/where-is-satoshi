You are right.  If we cut our the Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash drama, there are many valid altcoins out there that have unique benefits, and which may be more functional than either BTC or BCH. 
But it's like US democracy. It's easier to polarize people between two options than to try to make them pick the best of 30 options.

In 2014 bitcoin also held over 90% of all crypto market investments. Now that it holds just 35% and we have multiple altcoins in the 10-20% range, it’s a totally different market.
1. Why would we expect identical results in different markets?
2. Why would something that makes up 3% of the crypto market have the same impact as something that makes up 90% of the crypto market?

They can do this. They did do this. Back in 2008 everything was getting A and AAA ratings even when it shouldn’t have.  Deceptive ratings were a huge contributor to the market crash at the time.
Presumably the SEC has stepped in with more regulations and controls on ratings rackets, but I don’t know.

Time perspective makes a huge difference when looking at activity changes.  
The one month shows BCH getting absolutely crushed (80% decrease) while Bitcoin experienced a 20% slump.  Pull up the 3 month chart and they're up 100% while Bitcoin is down 15%.  Go back 6 months and they've both held about even, with BCH beating out BTC by a slight margin.
What makes BTC's price a "correction" but BCH's activity a "crash?"

That's great.  I'm hesitant to qualify Bitcoin's value on what *may be* implemented over what *is currently* implemented, but I'd certainly reconsider my stance on Bitcoin once it happens.


The simple answer is that Smart Contracts are what allow crypto to be better than traditional currency or credit.  We already have convenient, insured, liquid investment vehicles.  The question in my mind is "why use Bitcoin over my credit card?"  Contract guarantees are something current fiat and credit vehicles don't currently offer, so I think that's quite important.


You're right, smart contracts aren't perfect either.  As you implied, the biggest concern I have is that off-chain sales aren't prohibited, so enforcement and implementation are still up to the vendor.  I'm not sure what the best solution would be that doesn't require supporting regulation.


Let's imagine a worst-case scenario, based on real posts in You drive off the lot in your brand new car, but before you get home you crash it.  The next day the dealer calls and tells you your loan was denied but you can get another one at a 3% higher interest rate, and that you also have to cover an extra $800 pricing error.  They offer to let you back out of the sale, but since the car is totaled this is now a logistical nightmare.
Where smart contracts come in is that everything is finalized by the time you drive off the lot.  The loan is secured when the money is sent over from the bank to the dealership.  The car is secured at the offered price because the title transfer has already occurred.  Insurance can't lapse because the business day ends at 5PM, because coverage is renewed at the time of payment and not a the time of "processing."

There's a point to examining sponsorship of ideas, though.  When selecting a cryptocoin to support for long-term feasibility, you need to know the direction it's going in, and what technologies it will and won't support in order to make a prediction for the future.
Even in this sub, Bitcoin doesn't have a clear direction on whether it wants to be a currency, a trading vehicle, or a store of wealth.  There's no centralized agent acting on behalf of the population, so these decisions are fleshed out experimentally through forks.


That's a great point.  imagine if Einsteins works would have been recognized if the universities that backed his research and published his works...well, didn't.  If Einstein self-published his original theories instead of relying on scholarly journals, how do you think they would have played out?
Even better, why not look at a scenario where this actually happened?  Galileo tired to oppose the church with heliocentric theory, and was exiled from the scientific community.  It took nearly 200 years for his works to be accepted publicly, and nearly 300 for the church to reverse it's position.

You may be overinvested, in which case the only right move is to sell back down to your comfort level. If you're overinvested, you have make an expensive mistake. Don't compound that with additional mistakes trying to "make it back."

Bitcoin is highly secure, but it does use an older algorithm (SHA-2, specifically SHA-256)  In theory there are more secure algorithms, but security often comes with tradeoffs.  SHA-256 was selected as a balance between security and efficiency.


Potentially, but it depends on adoption.  A better product won't be adopted if people don't want the better product.  A big driving factor will be convenience and ease of use.


They're two different forks of Bitcoin with two different ideas behind implementation.  Both sides have benefits and downsides.  The "hate" is from people who want to polarize to one or the other.
Basically, both want to be recognized as "Bitcoin."  Bitcoin has worse fundamentals (higher trade times, higher fees) and Bitcoin Cash has the worse brand recognition (just another alt), so both sides feel threatened.  That leads to polarization and "hate".


It is slow.  It's being improved with second layer solutions like Lightning.  This wasn't really a question, so....yes?


I don't think it is.  I think smart contracts are important, and they're something Bitcoin doesn't offer at this time.

30% of 1.0kW and 30% of 1.3kW are not equal.  "30% less" than 1.3kW would be
    (1 - 0.3) * 1.3kW = 0.91kW
The correct formula would be:
    1 - (1.0kW / 1.3kW) = 0.231
It uses 77% of the power, or "23% less."  Saying Antminer uses "30% more" would also work.

A few other interesting observations, which (personally) make me cautious.

Us growth markets aren’t in a bubble?  The entire model of a growth market is in finding companies that are experiencing unsustainable, above-average growth, then trading them out for new companies once they’ve begin to flatline (or crash).
Go look at [GPRE]( classified as a "growth company" in 2017.  The Goldman Sachs financial analyst, [Adam Samuelson]( rated it as a [buy]( in 2015.  A cherrypicked example, but a relevant and recent one.

I'm not saying it wouldn't have negative impacts on Bitcoin, I agree with you there.  But we're in a completely different financial ecosystem than we were in 2014.  Given the increased maturity of the market and the availability of many new alternative investments, wouldn't the crash be expected to be notably shorter this time, perhaps 6-8 months instead of another 3 years?

Pretty much, yes. Multiple exchanges mean that at any given point, each exchange might have a slightly different USD value per coin.  They each have their own order books and bid-ask spread.
The prices between exchanges stay close not because of any internal mechanism, but because if they get too far apart, people can just start buying on one exchange and selling on the other for a profit.  This naturally helps the prices reach an equilibrium.

1. Moores law originally predicted doubling in *number* every year, then doubling every two years, then miscommunication by Intel as doubling in power (size + quality + architecture) every 18 months.
2. Moores law refered to the number of transitors that could fit on a chip.  Using an exponential or S-curve is a great idea for population modeling, but using 12/18/24 months is completely arbitrary.
I think we're in agreement.  Moore's Law isn't appropriate for predicting Blockchain adoption.
I'm really curious though, Bitcoin is often compared to Visa when considering Transactions per Second. Visa is credit.  Credit is very different from Fiat, because it's based off loans rather than earnings.  It's *designed* to add debt to the ledger and settle it out later.  It's designed to accumulate interest and fees.  It doesn't work like currency, and it will have different adoption rates than currency (it already does...).  So maybe, just maybe, the 2000 tx/s that Visa has is a bit higher than we need to aim.  Maybe 500 tx/s would be sufficient.  If so, that would change the required scaling speed significantly.

What happens if you buy in at 10x leverage, Bitcoin takes dip this week to 14k, and you are now floating a $50,000 debt?  It sounds like you wouldn't be able to cover the margin call.


I don't have any suggestions for brokerages, but I do want to point out that deregulated currency and leverage don't play very nicely with each other, because traditionally leverage *is* heavily regulated to protect the lender.  You may not have much luck finding what you're looking for, based on that alone.
You might find it makes more sense (although it's still a generally bad idea) to take out an unsecured loan through a bank or private lender instead of through the exchange.  You can leverage your investments that way, although it may be at a slightly higher interest rate.

I actually invest in a ETF that holds bitcoins ($GBTC), rather than directly buying bitcoins.  But my advice for holding actual Bitcoin would be to use an exchange-based wallet for short-term trading (one or two trades per week) and a paper/local wallet for larger investments and slower trades (one or two trades per month).


Least was a few hours (which never really worked out for me).  Most was probably ~7 days.

You're right, Bitcoin is the gateway, not the end-game.  Bitcoin has its faults and will adapt with forks and changes, but the ultimate crypto currency that will change the world of finance as we know it may very well be a fork of a fork, not Bitcoin Core.
But when will that real gamechanger come about?  If other currencies are faster, cheaper, or have intrinsic value, why haven't they eclipsed Bitcoin yet?  When will they?  Until they do, isn't Bitcoin still the industry leader that is most likely to point to those more valuable forks, and that ultimate game-changer currency down the road?
Bitcoin has a lot of value in the crypto market that comes from it's branding.  It has the most mining support and the most recognition outside the experienced adopters, and so it has the most potential, even if it doesn't have the best implementation.  That has to be worth something.

I know it's an unpopular opinion on this sub, but I do think we're in a bubble of hyper-speculation.  I hope I'm proven wrong down the road.


That's a great question.  It will be very difficult right now for something to get dominance over Bitcoin.  It is first to market and has that branding and support.  I think if an altcoin does overtake it as the primary chain, it won't be for a while.  But first to market isn't a permanent defense, just an early one.  Myspace was crushed by Facebook and Twitter.  Ask Jeeves and Yahoo were beaten out by Bing and Google. 
But here's the thing.  A fork is a split in two directions, not a branch off a main root.  So either of those forks could continue on as "Bitcoin Core."  If we want Bitcoin Core to have 2MB blocks, or Segwit, the majority of the network just needs to agree to call it the main branch.  So as much as I hate to agree with Roger Ver, Bitcoin Cash could have been Bitcoin (and Bitcoin could have been Bitcoin Cash), has the network accepted BCH as the primary fork.  They just didn't.


Bitcoin could go anywhere, but it's a really hard question to predict which branches and forks will ultimately be the winners.  It's up to the community, and the community votes on branding and media as much as they vote on technical superiority.  This isn't an entirely rational decision, so it's hard to make a rational prediction.
Personally, I believe some alt coin (within two branches of Bitcoin) will be the "winner".  But that's just speculation.


As a store of value, the [risk adjusted returns]( of bitcoin are currently a bit better than stocks or gold, so until that changes I'd say yeah, it's a great store of value.
As a currency, I myself found it to have a high barrier to entry.  There are too many types of wallets and too many transfer methods (not to mention high transfer times) that make it difficult to enter.  If I have to spend 3-4 hours teaching someone how to use Bitcoin, and getting them set up with apps that may not be supported in 2 years, that's a problem no one is discussing.

Bitcoin is fractional currency.  A "whole bitcoin" has no additional inherant value from a fractional bitcoin.  The sooner you can escape that mentality, the better off you'll be.


Why didn't you invest more money last time?  What was your reasoning behind that decision?  Does that reasoning still apply today?
Don't put yourself out of your investment comfort zone just because you are afraid of missing out.  What happened last month is no longer relevant today.  Invest only if you think it's a good play from today onwards.

**Let's start here.**


Any investment has a risk of loss.  This is a very important concept.  A small risk is still a risk, even if you accept it.
**I have a few other concerns with your post.**


If your guesses are correct, sure.  But a lot of the time, the market may look like it's going to stop going down, and then goes down further.  Or you sell because you think it's a peak, and then it goes up more.  It's really hard to do this accurately, and you have very limited information to work with.
There's an easy way to test this yourself.  Go look at the charts right now.  Try and predict whether the price will be higher or lower in 10 minutes.  Then see if you're right.  Repeat that a few times.


No.  You will not make 33x your money in a few days.  A good trader *might* double their money in a week or two with bitcoin.


While you only stand to lose $1 of your initial investment, you only stand to gain a few dollars as well.  Small investments equal small losses and small gains.  Large investments equal large losses and large gains.


This takes a lot of time and energy.  The people who watch charts all day are the people who make a living out of day trading.  You could do this in your free time, but...
There's another problem.  Prices fluctuate and Bitcoin is volatile, but they don't always fluctuate constantly.  You do see a lot of 1-2 hour "flat" periods, followed by a 5-minute spike or drop.  If your free time is mostly during "flat" hours, you won't be making any trades.  
**And now my own input.**


It does work, both in theory and in practice.  I trade Bitcoin (technically Bitcoin funds).  I've made more good trades than bad ones, but the truth is there are bad trades.  Sometimes I get prices wrong, and you will too.  That's OK, but it means that things go slower than you'd expect if you're only looking at the good trades.
In the end, day trading bitcoin makes me money, but it's important to realize that I make much more money at my day job than I do by trading.  It's not some magic get-rich-quick scheme.

One serious point of contention for this article is that while gobal *wealth* is around 280T, global *investment* is only around $80T.  This significantly skews the numbers if you note that people will not be selling land, houses, and emergency funds in order to buy Bitcoin.  These alternative investments have functional, intrinsic value that Bitcoin cannot replace.
This also makes the assumptions that Bitcoin can match gold for utility, exceed it by 5x, and then inflate further.  Let me address that in two parts.
1. A single currency becoming the primary store of wealth, investment, and transactional currency all at once would reduce diversification significantly, and introduce stability concerns.
2. Once bitcoin became the primary global currency against which all others currencies were measured, the impacts of further inflation would be extremely severe.
The math is sound, but I think the assumptions behind it are a bit sketchy.
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:48:53
People asked the same question at 1k, at 10k, and now at 20k.  They will only be right once.


One of the common ideas is to measure the market cap against other currencies.  So for example if you think Bitcoin can be as valuable as gold (8T market cap), then 8T divided by a finite number of 21M coins results in a $380,952 valuation.
There are other methods to generate valuation, but that's a very basic one.  If you think Bitcoin will take on a 20%/80% split with gold, and still let gold handle most of the wealth storage, than a $100k bitcoin is not unreasonable.


If the bubble doesn't pop, yes.  Maybe even within the next few months.


This requires some real work and time.  An alt coin or Bitcoin with some major revisions might, but I don't think Bitcoin in its current form can replace that much liquid currency.  This is more of a 5-year projection, maybe 10-year, and requires Bitcoin prove itself to not be a bubble during that time.
There are a number of factors that could prevent this, but it's still a reasonable valuation.


This is possible but impractical.  People are very likely to stick with gold and land instead of transitioning to non-tangible goods.  I agree with the math to get to the valuation, but the practicality behind the math is wanting.


If it hits 1 mil in our lifetimes, we're probably experiencing severe economy-crippling hyperinflation as government currency collapses and the governments that back them fall apart.  The citizens will the first to hurt from it.  Pray it never gets this high.

I’d suggest starting with whether the price of day trading can accurately be measured for longer term equities, and expand to BTC from there.  There is *current* research on how things like Retweets and Facebook Shares affect market price.  That kind of material would work very well for machine learning adoption. 
Though, I do suspect you’re right that it can’t be accurately predicted long term.  It seemed like it was used more for ugh-frequency trading. So setting your predictive timeframe for the research (seconds, hours, days?) will be important as well.

Value is a strong sentiment of what the market as a whole feels the concept is worth. Real dollar value is subjective, but if value changes significantly or experiences price walls, it gives a good idea of where the current sentiment sits.  Of course it's not the only relevant piece of information (we still want more people to adopt and understand the technology), but as we get more and more media exposure and less experienced investors, valuation becomes a stronger metric.
We can also measure the number of nodes or miners.  But unlike price, this doesn't tell us how bitcoin is being used at the consumer layer, only the technology later.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:51:22
There are a few ways to valuate Bitcoin, and strict valuations won't always apply in hyper-volatile markets.  So don't expect the same formulas to work consistently.
But one of the valuations I'm partial to is a factor of the gold market cap (8 Trillion), since both are currently used to store wealth.  If Bitcoin takes up 4% of the gold market, that's a 320B market cap for 16.6m coins, or 19k/coin.
5% (400B cap) on 21m coins comes out to approximately the same valuation, if you want to use a model where future coins are already factored into today's price.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:09:08
It's the value of holding bitcoin, not mining it.  That valuation model is basically saying that 5% of people think Bitcoin will be better (long term) than gold, and 95% of people think gold is better. Or more accurately once we factor in other valuation stores, it would look something like 50% government bonds, 30% gold, 5% real estate, 2% bitcoin, 1% other crypto, etc.
The point of calculating against gold-only instead of all those other factors is both simplicity, and that gold and silver are pretty close to bitcoin in being anonymous and decentralized.  It's a very simple method that is not going to provide a flawless valuation.  However, it *is* a way to demonstrate that Bitcoin has a value, and what price range that value might sit in based on its popularity and acceptance.

I do this sometimes, and I've done it successfully so far.  But learn from me when I say it's not a perfect strategy either.
Giving you estimated numbers, I bought at 7k and sold at 9k, then bought at 13k and sold at 15k.  Bought in again at 17k and sold at 19k.  Total profit, let's say **6k**.  If I bought at 7k and held to 19k, I would have made **12k**.
Trading on volatility was a nice profit, but I missed out on $6k and took on additional risk by trading instead of holding.  It's not a perfect strategy because you miss out on the upswings *between* trades.

Land is generally a very stable investment.  It goes up in price with population, and there aren't a lot of factors that can drive it down.  The downside is that it's highly illiquid and difficult to sell.
Bitcoin is extremely volatile.  It can rise very fast and grow in two weeks as much as it would take land to grow in 50 years.  Or, it may crash and lose money that wouldn't be lost in land.  Of course it's also relatively liquid so if he needs some of the money, he can pull it out as needed.
Really it's a matter of preference.  If you want to play it smart, you should probably have a stable backing to your investment portfolio first, and have bitcoins *on top* of that stable investment, instead of going all in.  If your friend sells the land, what other investments would he have besides this $10,000?

What is actually happening is I traded the exchange 3 BTC, and that transaction is recorded.  The second transaction is only recorded if and when you (or someone else) withdraws.  But until a withdrawal, the exchange can use and reuse or even create those "coins" as much as they want on their *private* balance sheet, without being held accountable by the *public* ledger.  They are only held accountable by the ledger when people withdraw, and then only for the amount withdrawn. 
Please correct me if I still misunderstand.

It's even worse if you scroll down the [actual listing](  They bought the condo just two years ago for $315k, and with two more years of appreciation (7.4%/y) it's "worth" about 363k.
Their asking price 7 days ago (when the listing was made) was 434k, and today they're asking for 533k.  Even if they accepted US dollars, it was a pretty bad deal from day one.

Memes aside and on a more serious note, traditional currency works similarly (5, 5k, 5M, 5B, etc.).  No one thinks a housing price of $235,000 is unreasonable, because 235k or 0.24M are easy numbers to mentally grasp.  Quite a few video games have used the concept as well, using Silver, Gold and Platinum coins instead of just forcing you to use a single type of coin.
The problem with just renaming units is that we're stuck in the same situation 6 months down the road, and we're stuck refactoring the currency names *again.*  That's not a good idea for something you want to become mainstream.
A more practical example would be to use the metric system to divide out the coin base into real, nominal "coins" instead of just fractional bitcoins.
* 1 Bitcoin = 10 DeciCoins
* 1 DeciCoin = 100 MilliCoins
* 1 MilliCoin = 100 Sastoshi
We can break down Sastoshi further as needed, although I'm not sure that the current system would allow that (technical barrier?).  This way, people can more easilly visualize how they want to spend "one Sastoshi," instead of trying to figure out what "one Bitcoin" looks like.

I've gotten calls from my bank before on a few occasions to confirm multiple unusual transactions.  Once it was something I did intentionally, once it turned out my card was stolen.  Any good bank is going to have something on their back end to identify unusual pattern spending.  


And there's why you got flagged, because it's an unusual spending pattern both in general, and for your personal transaction history.


They may want to know why you're not keeping your money at their bank.  That sounds likely, since their whole business model is built off people using their bank to store money.
But most likely, since they're bringing up money laundering, they may be concerned you are [structuring withdrawals]( and following up with their own federal obligations to ensure you (and they) are following the law.

@_date: 2017-12-16 06:15:10


There is risk-free or reduced-risk reward, but it is much smaller.  Higher risk does equal higher reward.
But risk has an implied downside.  The idea could fail, and the money and time spent could be lost.  **If** that happens, then you'd be worse off than if you hadn't invested in Bitcoin at all.
That's why over in and it's advised to invest based on your *risk tolerance*.  If you think Bitcoin has a 10% chance of success, you invest ~10%.  If you adamantly feel it has a 50-50 chance of replacing traditional investments and fiat currency, you might invest up to 50%.  If you think Bitcoin is the future and no one will ever convince you otherwise, you might go all-in.
It's Ok to take on some risk.  You *should* take on some risk. But it's typically frowned upon to gamble all of your money on something you're not 100% certain of.

No need to make it complicated by renaming it.  We already break up various units of measurement into smaller, differently-named units all the time.
Let's try a different approach:
* Bitcoins can stay as they are
* 1760 BitCoins will make up a MCoin.
* A new increment called Fcoins will be added that are 1/3 of a BitCoin.
* FCoins can be divided further into 12 units, called ICoins.
* Each of those ICoins can be divided into quarters for ease of use, and so forth.

I'm no bitcoin expert, so please correct me if I'm wrong about any of this.


Bitcoin is open source.  No one "owns" the idea, it was designed by an individual but then made public so that the public could "own" the concept.


That's the whole point.  Centralized currency like government dollars are prone to inflation and deflation, may or may not be backed by physical goods, may change or remove its backing (gold standard/silver standard/fiat in US currency is a good example), and generally requires trusting the centralized entity to not cheat.
Decentralized currencies removes the trust factor by using public, verifiable ledgers, and encouraging full transparency of all transactions.
Cryptocurrency removes the inflation/deflation factor by limiting the number of coins to a finite, known number, as well as enforcing hard, undisputable limitations on introduction rates to ensure adoption stability.
Bitcoin is both decentralized and cryptocurrency, so it gains both benefits.

Think of it like traditional currency.  The US dollar is serialized and unique.  You could collect it, in theory.  But when you look at your bank balance, what is the "serial number" of those dollars in your account?  How collectible are those dollars?  When were they printed?  Are some of those dollars worth more than others?
Bitcoin is itself just a ledger value in a database.  It is not serialized, and it is fractionally divisible.  If two people each send you 0.5 bitcoin, the resulting 1 bitcoin is not an "original" bitcoin, but it is represented in the same way.
None of that lends to collectability.

You may not like the gold argument, but many people do.  Gold is not just used as a tangible good, and bitcoin isn't just used as a trading currency.  Both are effective as securities, diversification against domestic markets, and stores of wealth.
But let's say gold is better than bitcoin as a security.  Let's even say it's 10x better.  Bitcoin's market cap would then be 10% of gold, or 700B instead of 7T.  700B distributed over 21M coins is a valuation of **$33,333/coin**.
It's all speculative, but Crypto doesn't have to be "as good as gold" to get to the current price valuation.  It can be 5% as good as gold, and still support the current price.

Something to keep in mind is that every transaction has someone on the opposite end.  When you buy a bitcoin, you're buying from someone.  When you sell, you sell to someone.  Their dollars go to you, but you haven't actually created more fiat, just transferred it.
To generate sizable wealth you also needed to invest significant amounts in Bitcoin.  Investing at $500 (fairly early for most investors) would still require a $33,000 investment to hit $1,000,000 today.  Most people aren't going to dump that much into something so speculative and unproven, and even those who would may have sold some of their investment off at $1000, $5000, or $10,000, instead of holding indefinitely.
And finally, growth slows down over time.  Bitcoin may still be a good investment, but it isn't likely to shoot up 30x in 3 years again.  Maybe it triples in value in that time.  Now, that means an investment of $333,000 is needed instead of $33,000.  How many people are going to have that much sitting around, and how many will be putting it all in a speculative investment instead of properly diversifying?
I think you're severely overestimating the number of Crypto Millionaires.

I'd relate it more accurately to a startup that pays you heavily in stock options.  If you work 9-5 at a startup, you run the risk of that startup failing,.  If that happens your stock is now worthless, and you have a little bit of experience and knowledge to show for your time.  But if the startup is successful, the stock grows and your salary retroactively becomes 500k/year.
The same is true for Bitcoin.  If Bitcoin fails, you end up with effectively worthless currency that can't be spent, because people aren't accepting it.  If it succeeds, it can be worth hundreds of times more than it is today, making your time spent today (or five years ago) much more valuable.
So yes, Bitcoin can be related to a startup.  In theory (and in highsight, in practice) you could invest in bitcoin instead of working at a startup, **and there's no real difference.**
There's a third scenario though, **and that scenario is very different.**  Going to a non-startup (or "fiat" currency).  When you do that, your salary doesn't change much.  Maybe you get some money into some traditional stocks and grow your money at ~10% per year.  But you know that working for a tried-and-true company, there's no major downside.  You never really run the risk of bankruptcy, so you know you'll always have a paycheck.  It won't be as big, but there's no risk of it going away.

Wouldn't this be sorted out by the time verification clears?  The long verification times are a big problem that does enable this, but assuming we could get near-instant validation, wouldn't all the double-spent transactions just fail and collapse into the longest chains?
Or would this only happen when the person with the cold storage wallet tried to move their coins back to the network (at which point they're now the shorter chain and their money is gone?)

No idea.  A lot of people mined coins rather than investing currency directly, and the investors that got in early generated significant market value for just a few hundred dollars.
I can try and estimate though, using some very rough numbers.  Let's assume 10% got in at $50, 40% of Bitcoin holders got in around $500, 25% at $5000, and 25% entering the market now and generating no value (so far).  For now let's assume no miners that held their coins, because that's a huge headache to try and estimate.
That comes out to:
    (10%*1b) + (40%*10.5b ) + (25%*105b) + (25%*388b) = 127.55b
So that puts us at 127b spent to generate 388b in wealth.  That's no small number, but it does mean that Bitcoin's market cap looks about 3x bigger than it actually is.

If you have 21m bitcoins, each worth $1 USD, then the total market value is $21m.  Now let's say you increase the cap to 22m bitcoins by forking the code and creating more. You still have $21m invested into the market of 22m, but now each coin is only worth $0.95.  Unlike the debt ceiling the new coins don't disappear into the ether, they are distributed and held by other members of the community (miners), so they have a direct impact on value.


If each bitcoin is worth less on this new chain, then the only miners and transactions on this chain will be people who want a chain where their own money is worth less. So you've missed an important part: incentive. What's the incentive for people to mine or transact on the 22m blockchain when the 21m blockchain offers more to those people?

@_date: 2017-12-19 02:59:57
Think of a dollar bill. It isn't backed by anything, it has value because the government says it does.  The government controls that value by printing or removing money, and by changing interest rates to encourage spending or saving. A dollar bill has a serial number to prevent counterfeit bills from being printed. 
Bitcoin is a communally accepted currency that cannot be artificially impacted. Inflation and deflation are natural, and no one is behind the scenes printing or removing money to away the market.  Further, it also has serial numbers (complex equations) which tell you not only when and where the coin was created, but it's entire history of owners. The record is huge, but publicly auditable. Rather than rely on banks to privately check for counterfeit bills, the public reliesnon each other to check the coins and verify their history. A transaction isn't "complete" until that audit is complete.
The biggest benefit is that it is very transparent so everyone can look at the "printing press" and see what transactions are being made, so there's no need for fancy reports and no risk of hidden money or secret trades. The biggest downside is that without market controls, it runs the risks that the public losing faith in the currency or market manipulation cannot be effectively prevented, only observed.  Since its deregulated, everyone can see someone hoarding coins, but no one can stop it from happening. 
Then again, the public has lost faith in many government currencies in the past. So it's not a new risk, just one that is harder to mitigate.

Ok.  Let's talk about FDIC.
First off, what is it?  It's insurance that covers a limited amount of money on a limited subset of account types.  That sounds great, until you realize that having too much money can actually be a problem.  Oh, and if you're robbed at home or on the street, sorry FDIC doesn't cover that.  Even inside the bank, if your money is in the wrong account type or you keep dollars in a safety deposit box *with the same bank*, you aren't covered.
FDIC is a cool service, but it's protection for the banks that is pitched to the customers.  It covers the bank in case of robbery, fire, flooding, etc.  It doesn't necessarily cover the customer, that still depends on a number of variables.  Is FDIC bad?  No of course not, it's awesome.  But it isn't very broad in scope.
So what's my point?  Well, what does FDIC have to do with mass adoption?  Limited scope, slow adoption cycles, and optimized for banks over customers...what part of that is a driving force behind fiat's success?

They aren't both bitcoin. They are both variations of the original Bitcoin chain. One of them gets to carry the bitcoin moniker and ticker, and that is the one that received majority consensus of being the next iteration of the technology. 
"Bitcoim core" was the more popular chain. It gets to be known as Bitcoin and hold the BTC ticker. Not because Roger Ver or anyone else says so, but because tens of thousands of people reached a majority consensus.
Having a majority doesn't mean everyone has to agree.  It's OK to support Bitcoin Cash or feel its better than Bitcoin. But we need to acknowledge that something with 30% market support means 70% don't support it.

Blockchain is just a ledger, and they keys are required to authorize transactions on that ledger.  If I go in and mine a transaction where you send me 50 BTC, the transaction would be rejected by the network consensus because the transaction is unsigned by you.  I can write and mine the transaction, but no one would accept it as valid. 
But who signs the creation (or destruction) of bitcoins?  The protocol, right?  There's no private key used to create bitcoins.  Arent creation events are handled very differently from transfers?   And wouldn't destruction events be handled in a similar way? 
So why can't the protocol destroy and reissue coins?  It would require developer and community consensus, of course. But what's the technical barrier?

Probably the same thing that happens when people die with no next of kin or extended family for their Fiat to go to.  The money doesn't vanish or get reprinted; instead, the state would be eligible to collect it.
Since Bitcoin is decentralized, instead of going to the state, it would probably be redistributed to new miners or across all current accounts on the blockchain.  We don't currently have a system in place for detecting and handling "dead" accounts, but one could be added as it becomes necessary.

Big banks typically take 2-4 days for transferred funds to clear, and checks can take multiple weeks before they're finally processed.  This is increased by a notable amount with international transfers.


Transferring domestically is typically cheap.  Transferring internationally triggers foreign transaction fees, anti-money-laundering fees, currency conversion rate inflation, international taxes, and a few other fees.  On a large transaction of a million dollars, you will clear several thousand dollars in "hidden fees."
I suppose I'm not really clear on how "actual functional banking" would solve these problems for large ($100,000+) transactions.

Legal regulation has to be unbiased and consistent.  If you want your money back when an investment would have done well, you have to also be prepared to get nothing back when they "spend it on crack."  As a real-world example, if a brokerage shuts down and you can't sell your investment in Radio Shack, you can try to reclaim your initial investment instead of just getting pennies back.
Legal regulation is also very difficult to base around hypotheticals.  After all, there's no way to prove that with access to the money, you wouldn't have sold in 2016.  Why is it fair for the law hold the brokerage accountable for the 2016-2017 returns that might not have actually existed?

One very key difference with bitcoin is that you also wouldn't be able to overdrawn the account.

How do you know they're not saying "A Bee Sea"?  Didn't the NATO phonetic alphabet come about because audio iterpretation is a known and frequent problem? 
Lets say an AI "hears" the noise as hei4287dj38, referring to a wallet address. This section of audio was actually slightly malformed due to the lossy compression, and it isn't a valid address.  The system has to guess using AI.  Should it "guess" hei4286dj38 or hri4287dj38? What are the implications of guessing the wrong one?
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:46:11
Sure. But think of it more simply. You have the inputs, 1, 2, and 3.  Your "hash function" is real simple. X + (Y + Z).  So you run your inputs through the function, 1+(2+3), or 1+5, or 6.  Your "hash" is 6.
Now stepping backwards from our hash, we have several possibilities for X, Y, and Z:
* 0,0,6
* 0,1,5
* 0,2,4
* 0,3,3
* 1,1,4
* 1,2,3
* 2,2,2
That's a set of 7 valid combinations, and by shuffling the order you can actually get a lot more.  You might have 20 valid solutions out of 1000 possibilities.
Now, consider that SHA256 is much, much more complex, uses not just addition, but also bit flips, bit shifts, and regular math, and you may end up with something silly like 1949383748 valid possibilities out of 2^256 possibilities.  Then consider 90% of those have too many leading zeros and are not valid hashes for Blockchain per the current difficulty. You might end up with just a few thousand valid solutions.
**So yes, you can reverse any cryptographic hash into a set of valid inputs**. They may not be the original inputs, but you *can* generate valid inputs.  It's not impossible.  It just doesn't make a lot of sense to do it, since guessing inputs is so much faster than reversing outputs.

A 51% attack is easier to do when 51% of the hash rate is a significantly smaller number. Isn't it significantly easier to generate 5TH/s then 25SH/s?
Gaining enough weight in a market to impact pricing doesn't even require ownership of 51% of the currency. 10-20% can make huge waves. Isn't that significantly easier to do with a currency where the market cap is much smaller?
Smaller networks are less secure by merit of being smaller networks.  Most influence and attacks require gaining some kind of significant control over the network, and that's always going to take far fewer resources to do on a smaller network.

I really appreciate you taking the time to respond.  I agree with most of your thought process, it makes sense to me.  I'll single out a few points I want to comment on though.


I don't entirely agree.  If forced to choose in today's system, I think I would prioritize life over privacy.
With that said, we shouldn't be forced to choose!  We deserve privacy *and* security.  It's one of the reasons I'm very interested in Blockchain (and Crypto).  It may not get us all the way there on its own, but compared to insecure systems like Social Security Numbers, it can get us much closer.


The idea of decriminalizing money laundering is a viewpoint I haven't heard before.  Thanks for sharing your views on it.  I don't know if I agree or disagree yet, but I'm going to think about it.

It's a lot of the same FUD.  New news is picked up and rehashed by nearly every news source following crypto.  Everyone wants clicks and ratings, so they're media outlets are incentive to spread news (good and bad).
The media doesn't need to have some secret financial agenda to post negative news.  Their agenda is to generate article clicks.


What major resistance level were we at this week?  What about last week?  The week before?  Are they particularly far apart from each other week-to-week, or are they indicative of market stability more than market influence?

Well, it's a complex topic, not one I really want to dig into today, nor in a cryptocurrency sub.
What I will say is that as an individual, taxes suck. As a country, they're one of the better options we have to remain an independent entity in the global environment.  A country needs a constant baseline of income to remain operational. That baseline comes from taxes.
Maybe we can find a better method, but we can't eliminate taxes without addressing the problems they solve.

It’s not just you, I skimmed the article as a well.  It is a really long read, with a lot of “filler” between the main points.  You’re not wrong for wanting a summary. 
Just as a heads up, both your questions are covered in the article.
The basic idea for why VC is bad for blockchain, as far as I understand the article, is because they invest aggressively and overprice their investments at low to no risk to themselves. They don’t need to make profitable decisions, they need to make decisions that make them look like they know what they’re doing. One 500% investment will do that even following 30 bad investments, so they’re incentivized to help fund ICOs whether or not the underlying coin is particularly useful.   This results in many “useless” coins diluting the market and bringing down the value of “useful” coins.

**Volatility** is an issue, I agree with that one. A store of wealth needs to store wealth, not fluctuate +/- 70% over the course of a week.
But **liquidity**?


They seem to be missing the part where when you do this, you don't get spot value for your coins, you get whatever the vendor is willing to offer. If you want spot price gold is often *not* liquid and can take several days (or longer) to get a buyer at a fair market value.  It's stretching the truth to call an asset liquid if that liquidity comes at a notable loss of value.  By that measure, CDs and Retirement accounts are also liquid, since there's just a penalty for withdrawing early. 
As for **time**, the jury is out. If the metric is "gold has been around longer," that will always be the case.  If you want to cite time frame as a criticism, then you need to tell me how long bitcoin needs to be around to reach acceptance.
It shouldn't need to be said, but do keep in mind the WGC has a vested interest in qualifying their own asset (gold) and devaluing competitor assets (bitcoin).  I would prefer to hear an independent third party's take on this.

As I understand it:
* Difficulty goes up and down, not just up.
* Costs decrease or increase with difficulty adjustments, meaning costs to mine rises and fall.
* If interest in mining falls, difficulty goes down, taking cost down with it.
* As cost goes down, interest in mining increases.
* We reach a happy equilibrium range for difficulty and cost.

Yes, if it replaces all fiat as an equal or better alternative. That isn’t likely to happen though.  The US dollar and the Euro are not globalized currencies, nor is gold.  Bitcoin may overtake some fiat, but can it overtake all fiat?  Can an open source project succeed where coalitions of governments have failed?
What are the odds of success?  What are the barriers and risks of such a system?  How do we get government and big bank buy-in?  What happens if an altcoin overtakes bitcoin in popularity?
So yes. One bitcoin could someday be worth up to $1,000,00, maybe even more. But after you factor in the risk that it fails to accomplish this, the valuation drops sharply and you end up at closer to 10k (today).

Kind of.  Hashing is used for a lot of things besides cryptocurrency.
Hashing is basically running a number (or several numbers) through a series of equations to get an output of a fixed size. For example, let's say you want to verify a credit card number is valid.  You might take the 16 digit number and run it through a specific hash function. The result might be a 3 digit number, which you then verify matches the 3 digit CSV number on the back of the card.
In cryptocurrency the inputs are some data from the current and previous block, as well as a randomly guessed "key." You run the numbers through a complex equation, get a number  back that is 256 bits long, and then check it.  If that number starts with 18 zeros, accept it as valid. If not, reject it as invalid and try again with a different guess. 
The catch with hashing is that unlike with math, you can't simplify or reverse the formula.  Once you have a result, it's (currently) impossible to figure out what inputs created that result.  It's a one-way equation, which is what makes it great for security.


Nothing. The code is all open source.  With litterally thousands of different cryptos available our there, many people *have* just created their own.
The more practical question is what incentive people have for using your crypto over other cryptos. If you make your own coin, how do you ensure that you aren't the only person using it?


Market demand. Bitcoin isn't priced like a product, it's traded and bartered between individuals. Price is made up of many individual trades. When you see the price float around s 10k for a few days, it's not any one person that decided it.  It's *hundreds of thousands* of transactions at that price, meaning tens of thousands of people believe it's a fair price.  There is no one idiot, this is the a significant portion of the market in agreement.
As for "why 10,000" instead of $5000 or $15000, hard to say. You can come up with a formula to justify any number. Truth is though, it's just a volatile market that's hard to predict, so there's a whole lot of speculation.

@_date: 2018-02-07 16:02:43
As I understand it, hash rate adjusts. Normally that means it gets more difficult (find a smaller hash) but as block times get longer, I believe the protocol can just say "OK, it's been two weeks and you guys aren't solving these 18-bit hashes very effectively. Let's try 20-bit hashes (easier) and see if you've done any better in two weeks."
We just see difficulty move in one direction (even though it can move both ways) because of the massive popularity rise and technology improvements over the last few years. There's been no reason to adjust difficulty back down yet.  There may be a reason later on.

It’s a long read, so admittedly I skimmed the article. But what I did notice is that this article took a persuasive stance that went off the logical rails a few times.  There’s an overuse of the word “taxpayer theft” and even a throwback to calling VC’s “commies” that didn’t sit well with me.  There’s some really good information in there, but by calling VCs names you’ve diluted the (good) points that preceded the insults.
I will say that it’s interesting to hear about *why* venture capitalism is so focused in certain regions, and what tactics they use to get into startups (like ICOs).  Those sections are really informative and I learned several things from reading the article.

Popularity/volume is the *biggest factor* for security in any form of blockchain.  That's the whole point of how blockchains work.
You can add all sorts of secondary supports, and they'll definitely help, but it's unlikely that any single security measure will ever eclipse the security offered by a 5x growth in popularity/nodes/capital.


Come on dude, it's not hard to understand this is a generalization/simplification.  I'm sure you can find a few examples of coins that are more secure but have a lower market cap.  But you can't ignore the other 1000+ coins that fit the trend.

Even if you do want to use these two data points (actually 731 data points, since they used daily data to create these charts), we can tell a different story.
If you use the Sharpe Ratio (a measure of risk-adjusted returns, rather than just volatility or returns alone), you'll see that while the volatility did increase, so did the average change.
    2016:     1.8% / 0.0308 = Sharpe Ratio of 0.58 
    2017:     4.1% / 0.0533 = Sharpe Ratio of 0.77
    Change:   (0.77 / 0.58) - 1 = 0.327 = 33%
In other words, the data seems to show an *33% improvement* of the quality of the investment, even though the volatility has increased.

I suppose I don't see why an individual creating a new bank would be any different from the many credit unions you see doing the same things.  Even if they openly support bitcoin, they still need to factor in risk when deciding whether to lend money they may not get back.

Miners no longer get a fixed amount of bitcoins, and now only get fees.  Because the reward drops incrementaly, the reward for coin 19,999,999 will already be close to zero. In fact it will be close to zero long before that

Not a lawyer, but when the media says THC is “legalized” that only refers to the state level.  It’s still federally illegal, and each state is still subject to federal laws. When something is legalized in that way, it means the state police no longer enforce that federal regulation. If the federal police (FBI) want to come enforce it, they still can.
That’s what happened here. Buddy pissed off the FBI and now the nature of the product (hash oil) will be used as evidence, since this is a federal trial and not a state trial.

Surge, No.  Move upwards, yes.  Some big players like Microsoft already accept Bitcoin, but a few big players isn't enough.  A few big players adopting bitcoin as a secondary payment method isn't the same as widespread adoption.
Arguably, I think that having many *smaller* businesses pick up bitcoin will have a much greater impact than having a few big companies accept it.


They can try to regulate whatever they want, the problem with regulating a decentralized currency is a lack of control and enforcement.  If they say there's a 50% tax on bitcoin tradesw, people just won't report their bitcoin trades.  How does the government enforce that tax if all transactions are anonymous?
However, they *can* regulate the exchanges, employers, and businesses, even if they can't regulate the currency itself.  If the government wants their cut (and they will), this is where regulation will happen, not on the actual peer-to-peer transactions.


Probably true.  Most of your fiat isn't even in paper bills anymore, it's just a value on your bank account.  If everyone made a run on the bank and demanded their money back, there wouldn't actually be enough paper money to cover it all.

So you felt bitcoin was undervalued and worth more, but you sold it at the undervalued price.  That's called "fear of missing out.". You deviated from your core belief in the asset to try and make a quick buck.
You didn't lose money because you didn't HODL.  Memes are generally bad investment advice.  You lost money because you invested against yourself.  If your fundamentals changed then you *should have* sold.  But in your case you believed one thing would happen, and then traded as though you expected something completely different to happen.

In terms of size, 500k blocks at about 1MB each means the total ledger is currently well under 1TB in size.  Down the road (think 10 more years) this may become a problem as we near 3-5TB, but also ask yourself how storage capabilities will improve in that time, and how Bitcoin's protocol itself will change to scale more efficiently.
As an example change, we could implement a running version of the ledger where we have users keep only the last 100k blocks instead of the full blockchain.  This would keep local ledgers constricted to 100MB while maintaining larger ledgers only on machines that can support them.

* If you buy back in at the higher rate, are you prepared to have the altcoin drop back down 35% to its original price?  That's a ~32% loss to you.
* If you wait for it to come back down, are you prepared to sit and watch it go up another 100% without investing?  That's 110% profit you've missed out on.

Of course. Linked lists were around in the 50’s, distributed databases were around in the 70’s, and *publicly standardized* cryptography has been around since the 70s as well.  These are not new technologies. Blockchain is not a new technology in itself, it is a combination and reimagining of several old technologies into a new form.
However, there is another side to this. Hashing (1930’s) and cryptography (2000 BCE) we’re not combined into Secure Cryptographic Hashing Standards (SHA and DSA) until the 90s. At this point we had effectively created a new technology standard. People don’t really implement one without the other anymore, at least not in mainstream public use.
So from a coding standpoint we have to ask: if blockchain isn’t new technology, can it still be a new standard?  Can it *replace* distributed databases, linked lists, and cryptographic hashing with one technology?  And while incentive for mining are necessary, can blockchain exist separate from a currency token, with other incentives?
Very rarely is the first iteration of a new technology the gold standard. We added automatic transmission and suspension to Fords automobile to make commercial vehicles, and we removed the propellers from the Wright Brothers’ plane to make commercial airliners. What will change by the time we get to “commercial blockchain?”  Will it still look the same as a decade-old white paper?  Does it still look the same today, with Lightning and Segwit?

Adoption is a process.  Not everyone is going to want to dive in all at once, and not everyone has the same level of buy-in that you do.  If you want to build a vendor network, you let them participate how they want to, and then convince them at a later date to participate how *you* want them to.
If you only accept people who are already 100% committed and refuse to support people who have partial buy-in or are still exploring the technology, you will have a small and ineffective network.

Why make a video where the entire text is in the video description?
Why make a video that tells me nothing about the product you’re selling?
Why make a website that wants my information before explaining what you’re selling?
Why make a reddit post linking me to a website instead of linking there in the reddit post directly?

Exactly, and that knowledge would keep someone who understands the fundamentals from investing their life savings into a single asset.

Certainly possible, the idea I proposed is very primitive, and requires consensus. I'm not assuming we'd get that consensus, just that the idea could be developed into a form that *might* get consensus.
At a high level, we would have to agree on some kind of assumption: say, accounts with zero transactions for 20 years can be assumed "lost."  Whether we use 20 years, 50 years, or some completely different metric would still need to be explored.

I did a few weeks ago. Sold at 10k only to cave and buy back in at around 13k.  Ate the 3k drop twice...
It could go either way. You might buy back in today only to see prices drop to 6k again, or it may just go up from here. What do *you* think bitcoin will do?  Invest accordingly.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:12:29
Even if you could be sure the price would go back up, a 60% drop isn't going to be comfortable.  Anyone in their right mind would be uncertain and concerned.  The fear, uncertainty and a doubt your feeling are completely normal reactions to losing half your investnent.
What matters now that we're down here is whether you accept the fear and calmly adjust your sell price and holdings to match your expectations, or whether you double down and make irrational decisions.
Forget the memes.  Forget any money you've already lost.  Ask yourself one question. If you had that money in your hand today, how much bitcoin would you feel comfortable buying at today's price?

I didn't leave them out, I just rearanged them in a way that was slightly less ordered.  21e8 moved to the end, and "genesis 0's" were left alone.  They're just now part of the leading zeroes.  I intentionally made sure that all  the relevant digits are still there, and that your analysis still holds valid for this new hash.
What I'm wondering is whether you and others would come to the same  set of conclusions if the order was switched up?
    \ 21e800 c1e8df51b22c1588e5a624bea17e9faa34b2dc4a
    \ 00 c1e8df51b22c1588e5a624bea17e9faa34b2dc4a 21e8
Here's my two cents.  Any hash without enough trailing zeroes is discarded, so the complexity of forcing something with trailing zeroes is something we already do every 10 minutes or so.  Nothing too special about that.  What's special is that 21e8.  There are ~~1.679 million~~ 65,536 combinations of four hexadecimal digits, which isn't all that extrodinarilly large.  Consider that we're 500k blocks into the chain.
Are 1 in 65k odds all that unlikely in 500k attempts?

The point is to address OP's question about why the Reddit staff won't take action against an entire sub for the actions of some of its community.  So long as the sub isn't going against [Reddit's Content Policy]( site staff isn't going to step in.

I'll give you some even more relevant examples. Who sells third party hardware wallets?  Who offers cloud mining service?  Who gets the Bitcoin ATM fees?  And who manages the brokerages people use to purchase crypto for fiat?
We already use financial institutions and third parties to make crypto easier to use.  While people can hoard fiat under their mattress or crypto in a paper wallet, most people turn to financial institutions *for convenience*, not necessity.

I rewrote my post, and also did not realize the numbers were hexadecimal.  16 place values, not 36.
The likelihood of stumbling across this randomly with 1 in 16.7m odds (16^6 ) with 500k attempts are still not crazy, though I'll admit the odds are quite a bit rarer if you're trying to force 6 digits instead of 4.  Statistically, this event had about a 3% chance to occur at random, if you're willing to be flexible on difficulty.
@_date: 2018-07-14 22:56:31


Could you point me to where you're seeing that?  Everything I'm reading points to block hashes being in hexadecimal format (0-9, a-f).  The hash you provided also has no characters outside that range.

So then anyone can look up my account balance and know how much I get paid, because it's tied to my name.  This impedes the ability to negotiate sallary, creates animosity among coworkers, and puts targets on people's back for kidnappings.  Privacy in bank accounts may be underrated, but it is fairly important.
But more importantly, let's say we do find a bad guy. A corrupt politician with 700 BTC in his account, who has a history of trading with Russian campaign accounts.  What can we do?  We can't freeze an account or seize assets in a deregulated ledger. Is our only course of action to arrest him and hope he doesn't flee the country (with all his money...) before we get to him?
These are kinks privatized banking has worked out already, and which need to be addressed if bitcoin is supposed to be "just as good" as traditional banking at stopping money laundering.

I didn't make it through the whole article because even that doesn't make much sense. This assumes that bitcoin replaces the entire world supply of bullion, without addressing *what happens to thst bullion*.  Does it magically disappear from the economy or something?

Kind of. You still do have to pay taxes on those things. The fact that you can lie about your income makes things harder, but it doesn't change the fact that legally, you have to pay taxes on it.
Your employer also still has to keep decent records to remain in business, including reporting income from customers and employee wages.  This hasn't changed with bitcoin.  All the same checks to prevent you from lying still exist, and all the same loopholes to lie still exist.  If you refuse to pay, the IRS can still garnish your paychecks before they ever get to you, or sue you and get a court judgement demanding you turn over your bitcoin assets.  Those tools also don't change just because you use bitcoin.
The counter-question is, what part does the bank even play in taxation and tax collection?  Bank asset seizure is just one tool they have.

Investing on what you think the market will do day-to-day is effectively gambling.
You should not use cost basis/buy price when assessing long positions, because you can quite litterally sell your investment realize your gains (or losses), and reset your cost basis to the current price at any time.

Reputation is the biggest one. Think about how your mom might have called your Playstation or Xbox "the Nintendo".  Just like lots of parents see a game console and think "Nintendo," a lot of people see cryptocurrency and think "Bitcoin."  Thst brand recognition carries a lot of weight.  When you get someone to try crypto, adopt crypto payments, or learn about crypto, it usually starts with Bitcoin before (sometimes) branching out to other options.
So, you get a scenario where everyone who uses Etherium has almost certainly learned a bit about Bitcoin, but not everyone who has used Bitcoin is familiar with Etherium. The same is true for smaller alts.
That's not necessarily the only benefit, but don't underestimste the strength of being first to market.

Follow the golden rule: **Only invest what you can afford to lose.**  If you haven't hit that point, buy more.  If you have, hold.  If you over-invested, sell off some of it.
If you're still not sure, you should either sell off (because you don't understand your own investment decisions) or you should do more research (so you can determine the actual value of the assets you're holding).  Relying on advice from strangers and memes is generally not a smart way to manage your finances.

Sounds like ~50x leverage. 
Without leverage, the worst you can do is lose is that $22.  With leverage, you can potentially lose $1000.
Scale it up a bit.  Do you see a problem with owing the bank $1 million when you only (had) $22,000 in your account?
@_date: 2019-05-14 07:10:15
Very true, I missed that as an option.  Thanks for mentioning it!
However, [according to this]( 


While I've never looked into it, I imagine you'd be making a $50,000 salary paid out in whatever the current bitcoin exchange rate is, not a ฿50 salary every month.  This is because of both payroll obligation and volatility:
* If Bitcoin inflates 2-3x in valuation in one quarter, suddenly their payroll inflates with it.
* If Bitcoin deflates by 2-3x, people who were making reasonable salaries may now be making below the poverty line/minimum wage, and the company is still on the hook for the difference.
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:06:02
The exchange rate and strength of the dollar do matter here, because bitcoin is strongly tied to the dollar as both an entry and exit point.
Why do we need an entry point?  Because the only way to get bitcoin is either buying it directly with your dollars, or buying mining equipment with said dollars.  You can't get in for free, not on any substantial or sustainable level.
Why does the exit point matter?  Because many things still can't be bought with bitcoin, and when you want to pay your utility bills, having a way to convert your bitcoin into your locally accepted currency is still quite important.
Ok, sure.  Bitcoin *shouldn't* care whether the stock market goes up or down, what the price of gold is, or the exchange rate to the dollar.  But in reality it does, at least for now.  It's simple minded to think otherwise.

The statement I responded to was about reducing risk to zero. My point is simply that you can only reduce risk to zero if you can cash out your initial investment, and that this may not be as quick or easy as it sounds.
Bitcoin may reach 100k but it also may stabilize at 1k.  The "cash out" strategy works realy well one of those scenarios but completely falls apart in the other.  That's a risk worth noting.
@_date: 2018-12-29 15:58:41


Assuming you can do that.  Quite a few people had that plan at $10k, myself included.  We were caught holding the bag and unable to take that initial money back out.

@_date: 2019-05-27 06:03:13
I'm not clear on how some of these things equate to a huge valuation.


The same logic applies at $10,000 USD, because each "bit" will be worth $0.01, with the *added advantage* of still scaling properly to fractional currency without rounding issues.  Tying one Satoshi to $0.01 USD is such an arbitrary number.


Wouldn't this already be mostly factored into the price, since it's a known feature of the technology and has been known for over a decade now?
