Oh well, if your goal was an illegal activity to begin with, then yea...I guess. 


The largest I can think of is ~$500. If you can't afford a min balance at that level, why are you playing Bitcoins?


Completely avoidable.


Well, it is up to you to incur CC fee by not paying your bill to due. Also avoidable.

Ha, wasn't thinking. But yea, a currency can't exactly reach negative value...yet. 
@_date: 2014-06-27 13:17:08
I wonder would OP would put money to his month and pay all his vendors using Bitcoin, not credit card. 
After all, that make him a "consumer" as well. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:12:54
Actually, it would show up one way or another. For corporations, they have to report their revenues. If all they do is put B.C in a offshore/off-the-books account, it would look like as if their inventory were being sold at a loss. 
At that point, it will certainly invite an audit. 
Furthermore, Bitcoin as a currency is a bit unstable. Companies like a stable currency to work with. Unstable currencies like BS drive accountants like me nuts.

If this was a regulated Bank, they can't use customer funds to pay off general creditors.
But it is not. So lawyers GAME ON! :D

1) If you refer to Wires, TBH as a former Bank officer I don't even want to do it. The process to do wires are insane. You need two officers to key (dongles, code and shabang) into the system via two secured comps, then at least one person at the other bank need to credit it to the other side's account. I hated Wires. We raised our Wire price just to ask our clients to STOP DOING IT. 
2) Frankly, until Bitcoin have a solid price band (and non of this zero-1000-50  roller coaster shit), Bitcoin will never replace paper/saving account. Why? Because the most attractive part of a currency is its acceptance and STABILITY. If the value of my bank account can move between -100% and 400% in a day? I don't want to be near it. 
Edited for error.

TL:DR.

Soda, hamburger and ketchup are not used as currency. We consume them as food. At least try to compare apple to....oranges?
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:00:52
It prevent banks from processing Bit-Coins, so it is a technical-Ban. So bitcoin is more of a barter item now. I.E you use a gold coin to buy groceries.

Guess what? The person who report 30K income living in a mansion is probably already UNDER-REPORTING her income. AKA CHEAT. 30K a year wouldn't even cover the property tax. Unless you propose to move a majority of U.S population to the Kayman islands, good old IRS will always hunt you down. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 20:45:00
As opposed to the good old days, where the sellers just sell and flee.

If it want to be a respectable currency, I hope it will be exactly 1 BTC. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:53:01
They aren't. :P 
Companies that accept Bitcoins have to convert it into cash and pay Uncle Sam. Individuals have to pay it on their 1040 as a gain on their investment (No different than if I was playing the currency market). 
Yes, you could escape the tax by not paying, but lets put it this way, so did Al Capone. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 17:26:37
Well that is part of the problem. There always would be a faction of Bitcoiners who want to "wild wild west" of 0-5000 USD/BC and will always try to encourage it.
And as long as that is going on, BC will never gain mainstream.
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:36:29
Good call. 
Now how would he spend his ill-gotten savings? Either through black-markets such as the silk road, or through legit vendors. The first is actively targeted by the Feds for destruction, the second usually would have to report sales tax anyway. 
Now, escaping income tax is in theory possible, but the IRS has always to good old eye test. Ms. Lily Smith is living on a $30,000 income while owning a two stories mansion. Something isn't adding up...

CEO of China? o_O
@_date: 2014-03-14 19:36:47
Pfft...no. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:53:41
Well in the United States it wouldn't. If he really pulled a stunt like that you could pierce the corporate shield and chase after the BCs.
I am sure in Japan it works similarly. You can't use the law to protect ill gotten gains. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:19:12
Ah, I see.

On other hand, my girlfriend brought her favorite book series from a online seller, we ended up with 6 packs of hand soap instead. 
The sword cuts both ways you know. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:46:30
China didn't ban bitcoin...it just regulate it as a commodity.

On other hand, IIRC a bad debt can be written off as a deduction to your income. My losses purchasing dubious products isn't tax deductible. 
And people who dispute too many transactions would get a hit on their credit card/credit rating too. 
In term of advantages, Businesses still have more protection than the average consumer. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:24:05
Just curious, which banking fees are you talking about? Are you talking about Interest in Loans?
And BTW, Bitcoins are already getting taxed. As a merchant, you would have to pay sales tax.
@_date: 2014-03-14 17:03:04
WOW MMO gold was once upon the time a "Bitcoin" way before Bitcoin came out. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:28:42
There is also the issue this is an initial investment. That machine, licencing rules don't come cheap. Once the company recover 100% of their base cost, they would lower their pricing. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 17:24:48
On other hand, you realize every business have vendor's as well. OP's business plan is to have Bitcoins to prevent buyer fraud...but someday he might as well be shipped sub-par products from somewhere in the Internet...
@_date: 2018-10-26 14:08:54
It isn't that cheap, it is just subsidized. So if you abuse it you will be arrested. 
@_date: 2018-10-26 20:07:53
Actually no, electricity are made cheap through funding by the CCP, but there is specific rules of conservation attached to it. 
If you have power usage 5 to 6X of your neighbors, the government will investigate. 
@_date: 2018-10-25 20:53:31
Lets drastically shrink the economy then.

ITT: Couple kids found out about Bitcoins and suddenly they think they are John Galt. 
Relevant quote. 


@_date: 2018-10-30 14:05:57
That is a silly argument. The Government even tax illegal profit like Narcotic proceeds and Hit Man for Hire payoffs.
Even if you claim "Crypto is anonymous, da government sucker can't find me", they will always find a way. If they can't then they will make it illegal.
The very last thing we want to see is a "War on Bitcoin" like "War on drugs"
Edit: Even if Crypto become super anonymous and impossible to track, Governments can put pressure on Corporations from accepting them. If stores stopped accepting Cryptos, then cryptos will lose most of their meaning. 
@_date: 2018-10-26 21:14:43
They have limits you know. An average family of three likely have electricity of X, a small business with Y etc. 
If you suddenly show up with twice or fix times that figure and it happen consistently, it is a red flag.
