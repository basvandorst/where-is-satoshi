If you would like to discover Bitcoin by chatting with other people, I would recommend you to install Telegram and check the communities on [coin.army]( 
For beginners, I think a good group to check in is [Bitcoin Chat]( or join your local community. 
@_date: 2016-08-23 06:23:01
There is a discussion going also on [Telegram](

True, but  I want them as they happen, and it takes a while to appear here. An
@_date: 2016-04-02 23:18:44
Simple, next will be everything on Bitcoin. If it worked so good for drugs that definitely will be great for other things.
@_date: 2016-04-30 16:00:19
Put some bits inside the cap and people will love them. A small amount like a recycling cash rebate in Bitcoin. People will love the free Bitcoin and you can advertise different Bitcoin businesses on top of it.
@_date: 2016-04-19 21:07:12
No man, don't want to hear anymore about r/btc and XT, uncensored is fair. Will check the sx to see what is there.
@_date: 2016-04-23 17:03:21
Talk with your customers, give them the option to book your service on demand. Probably you won't get tipped in Bitcoin so much, as there are few users spending it, but you can make people tip you more FIAT with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-04-08 11:05:26
That's why this platform should be done on top of Telegram. 
@_date: 2016-04-28 11:41:52
You are wrong, google will do his job, and if people need your shit, they will find it. People are firing now for power, they got rich and now want power. 
@_date: 2016-04-03 02:09:23
There is an app on top of telegram, that place you in contact with the local bitcoin community, maybe you can find someone to sell you some coins.
@_date: 2016-04-03 02:13:16
You can't tell, there's only a few that are able to imagine what Bitcoin will become, probably for most of them is the way for a better life, more cash, bitches and powder. 
@_date: 2016-04-19 01:02:14
Tltr . What catch? People will pay %6 fee, buy Bitcoin and spend it on open bazaar.  1 million am I wrong?
@_date: 2016-04-08 12:12:19
So are you the developers of this bot? Definitely you should add shared wallet, currently using Copay, but it will be fucking awesome to be able to make shared wallet directly based on your telegram user. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 18:46:05
Build a solution for everything!!! If you don't know how to do it I will explain.

Should be nice to be able to notice user again after some time, like RemindMe bot. Would be nice for people to get a message after an year something like: Yes you ignorant, the price of bitcoin was $460 when user mentioned ion Dec 19, now it's $100.

Currently, old hardware is useless on the main chain, because of difficulty, but think about, maybe next year  will be useful for the side chain.

I think nobody does, 20 years ago would you imagine reddit? Look on how he carefully chose his words when speaking about bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-12 02:50:25
Start with 1000 bits @_date: 2014-12-02 01:52:06
Good point. I was thinking to spend some money on a physical coin, but better I give a paper wallet with more bits
@_date: 2014-12-17 11:36:14
Even for $10 I guarantee that I will have couple of mockups, now if the designer consider that he need more for this job, he can always ask. 
designcrowd.com does a great job, but most of people don't know about it, so instead placing a request on Odesk that I'm looking for a designer, I could place $10 on the app, and some people will make recommendations about how to get this done. 
Don't focus on this logo design example, think that coca cola can use the app to promote their new products. They place $1000 in escrow and will split this amount to all users that take a picture with the new coca cola product.
@_date: 2014-12-03 22:24:50
I consider the idea pretty interesting, because I would use it every day for both work and fun, and I spend some coins monthly. dunno, I've got couple of ideas in the past that found after years that were done by some others because I was lazy. 
@_date: 2014-10-30 12:03:24
One more try for 500 bits @_date: 2014-12-02 02:00:53
If you have in mind to buy one as a gift, better use a paper wallet and add some more bits on it.
@_date: 2014-10-28 00:09:05
I bought a blowjob, expensive but worth it.

Well let's make it double 2000 @_date: 2014-12-14 02:07:11
because you haven't sold them yet. when you'll lose your faith, and sell be sure that the price will get back on track to new high
@_date: 2014-11-08 16:07:54
It seams that you have a good knowledge about it. Can you explain exactly how it is supposed to work. I have a big tip for your effort. 
@_date: 2015-05-06 05:43:43
yes I have a product and I'm trying to push it to the bitcoin community, I'm sorry but I'm not a good writer and most of the time people misunderstand me, that's why I want to have a voice chat. 
@_date: 2015-05-06 05:34:42
this is not about my trading skills, come to hear what app I'm trying to build and at the end, if I won't be able to convince you to use it, take my bitcoin and we can talk about trading.
@_date: 2014-10-30 11:44:55
I feel that you bought a large stash of aether that's why you want sidechains dead.
@_date: 2017-02-01 12:58:19
 is a mobile wallet that allows you to manually set the fees.

I would defiantly use it, seen that now they have Magic+, probably they have lot of customers and few delivery guys. The idea is great and probably most of you can't imagine how big this can be, imagine an Openbazar for everything, not only for good, just everything, where instead of shops you have groups of people who operate a business, totally on bitcoin, with employs who get paid instant for their work in bitcoin and so many other interesting things. You can even combine a social media to give this shit a little more of color, but to be the ultimate shit to be able to make it the second big thing after mobile phone, you need to add something from that sesame credit shit. I cannot write.
@_date: 2015-01-05 23:18:08
i think this is directly related with this dump
@_date: 2015-01-24 21:54:50
Check with airvpn
@_date: 2016-01-03 01:36:07
What if that game will be actually happening in real life and bitcoin will allow you to have access to a big amount of people worldwide ready to provide you answers to your questions and ideas, you will be able to survey different people in exchange of some bits.
@_date: 2015-01-21 23:47:29
hope it won't get downvoted, let's make the change guys
@_date: 2016-01-31 22:31:34
$1 @_date: 2015-01-06 14:51:03
no, most of the people don't consider the idea unless they came with it, if is someone's else idea, they don't give a shit
@_date: 2016-01-02 16:28:41
I'm already there, but they mostly discuss about trading or their personal life.
@_date: 2016-03-08 17:25:03
Why the fuck you don't take those USD transform them in Bitcoin and pay each user 2-3 bits / impression and instead having 1 adblock software, we will have multiple platforms that compete who pay more to their users.
@_date: 2015-01-22 19:42:55
this should be big... isn't it?
@_date: 2015-01-01 22:09:16
you're right, I've got my mind somewhere else
@_date: 2015-01-01 19:24:04
Trading bots were offline I suppose 
@_date: 2017-02-01 13:58:01
It does, but you need to use a different middle man, 
@_date: 2016-01-03 09:35:05
I totally agree with you, I'm long enough into Bitcoin to notice already some of the benefits. Currently I'm trying to figure out what is the problem that prevent other people to discover Bitcoin and be useful for them. 
@_date: 2016-01-03 12:40:35
So if me along with a couple of friends, decide to buy and deliver cigarettes, soda and food for lazy people and get paid in bitcoin, will get us to jail? 
@_date: 2016-03-04 15:56:54
BTC pay outs for what? Advertising?
@_date: 2016-01-07 18:09:51
they are under ddos I think, I was able to witdraw some coins couple of minutes ago.
@_date: 2016-01-07 04:14:36
There won't be any spaceships, you will be able to browse many  stations where people request or trade different things. 
I see that you're a traveler. Imagine yourself running a business similar to  inside this game, uber,airbnb, anything can be build inside this game. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 17:02:26
No I don't want to exchange fiat to bitcoin, I just want to give some bits to my customers, there are no local laws to restrict me doing this.
@_date: 2016-01-11 17:53:08
There should be a trick to allow me to do this, I can even come with bitcoin from my own pocket and don't take any money from company. 
@_date: 2016-01-03 10:08:57
No is not, think about SR, if you have a product and Bitcoin make it easier for you to get it, they won't care about the wallet, they will adapt and use whatever they find. 
Probably you're the geek, who is never satisfied about his work, and think that it can be done better. Stop trying to develop software and features for your geek friends and look around on what masses need.
@_date: 2016-01-03 01:32:16
What if find local businesses to refund 3% of your bill in Bitcoin? Will this work? 
@_date: 2016-01-30 23:42:32

You will have some hard time trying to explain to homeless how this works or even harder when it come for shelter to agree to work with this.
I think the best way to make this work, is to chose some of those homeless and offer them a job, to work like a proxy between you and those who need help. You can ask him to do different things like taking pictures of people who got help, receipts etc. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 18:38:38
Yes. Maybe you can ask them add a separate room for people to discuss only bitcoin, someone can chose different topics and people to discuss on them.

Everything is like it should on TS, I don't have a problem with their chats, it's a great community with some great people. Don't get me wrong, I'm just looking for other people interested in discussing Bitcoin, to know that no matter what time it is, there are some people that you can abuse their knowledge, without any price action and other dramas.  
@_date: 2016-01-07 02:15:03
The game will be as simple as possible, you take people needs or problems and try to resolve them with bitcoin. You need a sandwich and it's to late to go outside, no problem, there is another user who need some extra money, for the fair price, he will feed you. 
You need something more complex, no problem, whatever you need, there will be guilds or players ready to solve them.
@_date: 2016-01-03 12:14:28
Don't know how it's at your end but locally if I earn $1k my employer must pay 600, I have no problem to get 1.3k and pay my own life insurance and shits. Maybe I'm wrong, never got a job and don't know the full benefits of working for someone. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 03:56:13
Actually will revolutionize all industries. 
@_date: 2016-01-18 20:53:37
imagine that we've just invented our first cars and already the engineers are screaming that we need 14 lanes highways, even if the majority don't know about this invention
@_date: 2016-01-18 23:27:17
I mean why the fuck to pay 7% to sell my precious bitcoin, when I can have a dude who buy them for 3% and I don't even need to drive 10 miles.
@_date: 2016-01-07 18:10:27
think they are under ddos, and this is manipulation, I haven't got any emails and couple minutes ago I was able to withdraw my coins
@_date: 2016-01-07 02:01:24
The game will be played by everyone, I mean people should hear about Bitcoin because of game.
Everyone start by joining his City Group of this game, he will meet other dudes interested in bitcoin, they will start chats, followed by beers and never ending discussions about bitcoin.
Second step will when users will start buying and selling bitcoin for low fees, I mean why I should drive 20 miles to the nearest bitcoin ATM to sell 1 coin, when I can send a message to the local group, and if there is someone interesting in trading bitcoin for fiat, he will contact me. 
I'm bad at writing what I think, if you find it interesting please join this shit and let's get this game started, I'm trying to do it for more than 1 year.
@_date: 2014-12-17 11:47:47
openbazar has nothing to do with this, you can compare the concept but is not the same thing that I have in mind. 
Imagine the app like a reddit post, where on the top is the request and bellow users discussing on it, the OP can select couple of users and create a group chat, like on whatsapp, all of this done from the mobile phone. 
Think about if I need to change 2BTC to fiat. Currently my local atm charge more than 7% fee, so instead of this I will place the request on the app, saying that I will offer 4% to the one who bring me the cash. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 16:59:57
Because is damn wrong, at least at this time, people don't have bitcoin and those who have, don't want to spend it. 
Starting from this, maybe is better for me to give them bitcoin, maybe they will visit my business daily just to take some bits, dunno. I will post results once I have it tested.
@_date: 2016-01-03 09:50:57
I think the question should be this. Will your customers be interested to earn some Bitcoin each time they spend their fiat with your business? 
Everybody try to convert business to stick the Bitcoin accepted here logo in their window even if there so few users that own bitcoin, so we need to change this, we need to teach business owners that they can have more benefits if they lower the prices with 1% and return that amount in Bitcoin to each customer. 
People love Bitcoin but they don't want to spend their fiat on it, so let's find a way for businesses to reward their clients in Bitcoin and this will rock. People will hunt places that give you Bitcoin for your purchases.
@_date: 2016-01-31 22:23:27


I think this is the word that made you the winner.  $8
@_date: 2016-06-03 22:51:57
That's the best I can do at this time. But you have my word I'm doing something great. 
@_date: 2016-06-09 08:07:40
True, but China never stops buying cheap, so either way I think we will see some deep before this month end. I think most people will jump into shitcoins, price will drop and will be followed by a massive purchase that will take the price to the roof, followed by a second one generated by the altcoin sales. 
It's not Bitcoin I know if we don't see this before halvening
@_date: 2017-01-05 21:19:11
because some of them will
@_date: 2017-08-28 12:05:46
then you should start and dig for my private key

You're talking about online credit card processors. How many times you've made a restaurant charge back, for what reason? 
@_date: 2016-11-01 17:04:28
Not if I sell something. Let's say I sell lemonade and each glass has a QR code on it, I'm still a lemonade seller and I'll pay tax for it. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 01:49:07

I know about them, but there is not a single service that pay your salary in advance daily in Bitcoin. Probably is not interesting for you but frankly speaking everybody should opt for this way.

thanks again, you helped me save a lot of time. see you around

yes but you can always use it on localbitcoins with other traders, your goal is to buy bitcoin, it's not important who sell them

bullshit, why the fuck you don't associate each coin with a bitcoin address and authenticate them by using mint main address from where you deposit on dollar on each coin. someday that $1 will be more valuable than the coin itself. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 11:50:11
If you quit you're an idiot. Install Copay as wallet, transfer your remaining coins and enjoy the ride.

I'm trying to find a bitcoin wallet that can be used as an anti-counterfeit solution for a wide area of products from  clothing to hardware equipment.
@_date: 2016-11-07 12:47:55
I don't think there are any merchants that will take the risk of processing your credit cards and pay your Bitcoin. Is this for an online business or a rl store?
Don't expect to get lot of Bitcoin payments, most of the users hold their coins. If you want to take any advantages of associating Bitcoin with your business, use [CryptoBack]( and reward your customers with small amounts of Bitcoin on each sale. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 17:48:35
Thanks for the advice, I will have it in mind.
@_date: 2016-11-01 17:05:05
nobody want's to leave their "mom's basement"
@_date: 2016-11-26 01:44:28
you can try and build a market where you match people who have bitcoin want to buy different products online with your customers, so your customers can pay for their orders directly and you will get bitcoin. 
this will be considered by many a stupid idea, but with some small tweaks and restrictions you can make it work.
@_date: 2016-11-16 08:12:33
Why don't u ask directly the German Bitcoin community on telegram... You can find it on coin.army
@_date: 2016-11-07 20:29:08
And how come that drugs and luxury products companies don't use any of those services? 
@_date: 2016-12-30 10:24:59
You should have those words, probably mycelium is asking to back up them before using the address to receive funds

So do you think it's expensive to print a tamper proof bitcoin address on each item you want to protect? You can easily prove that item is authentic just because the address will have a small amount of Bitcoin received from the Manufacture Main Address. Chinese will be able to replicate the sticker but there is enough a single customer to move the coins and the entire batch will be fake. 
@_date: 2015-07-31 12:28:37
Would you do it? 
@_date: 2016-02-21 15:01:15
Is it [Robocoin](
@_date: 2016-02-02 00:37:24
I would spend my Bitcoin for this. 
@_date: 2016-02-21 14:46:41
this is interesting, thanks
@_date: 2016-02-26 19:30:03
they are ok, I just did a payment couple of minutes ago. They got some problems in the past, they also have some current issues, but I think they're the best on market. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:53:33
I remember someone trying to build one some time ago, [tixie]( I'm interested also if someone wants to build one. 
@_date: 2016-02-02 18:54:04
Since couple of months ago, I thought that  OB will be a new version of SR, now seams that things have changed, anyway don't think their current framework will be good for this kind of services. 
@_date: 2016-02-21 19:01:03
Here I think they managed to change the software somehow, but people avoid them as much as possible due to the high fees. This is the blue window that transformed in drive through.
@_date: 2016-02-20 18:01:31
now, compare your life expectancy with Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-02-21 14:40:06
So the [top]( expensive keyword is $50 (100k bits), I think is a nice amount of bits that can be paid directly to users instead going into google pocket. 
If you sell this to people like: hey install this extension, we will just simple replace replace your current ads with ours, and pay you each time we display them on your computer. Don't you think there will be enough people to do it?
@_date: 2016-02-01 10:32:00
If you manage to open a merchant account, you should verify you clients by asking them to show their credit card and id over Skype. 
@_date: 2016-02-21 14:55:04
we have so many bits that we can make a standard from those who abuse the system and pay more to those who don't.  
@_date: 2016-02-06 12:24:58
[ePimps]( it's on my list. Hope will be ready soon.

to help new people understand how bitcoin works by using it, to understand more about wallets, transaction fees etc. Also I would love to see more businesses that reward their customers with small amounts of bitcoin instead placing bitcoin accepted here logo in their front window. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:46:44
am I able to get a coin faster if I pay more? 
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:47:54

@_date: 2015-04-30 20:10:07
@_date: 2017-09-12 11:49:35
then you should find a way to print currency backed by bitcoin and ship it to africa for them to buy goats and mules where there is no internet coverage. can you do it?
@_date: 2015-04-13 17:45:52
dude you see it wrong, maybe I got my coins by mining back in 2009, or selling weed on SR. newcomers will never spend their precious FIAT for bitcoin
you build fancy exchanges, implement bitcoin payments with thousands of websites, but still people don't own and don't want to spend their FIAT for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-26 19:39:59
good let's check a different approach. What if $1 will go to your pocket and for the remaining $10 you buy meal for the next beggar you find on the street. 
would this make a difference?
@_date: 2017-09-27 12:05:47
I got free money so I have no problem to give some to others. If you do the math you will see that I've started this in June with $230, paid some to users and I still have left $250. The value of those bitcoin will grow faster that what I spend on my visitors. 
@_date: 2015-04-25 02:29:04
regulated by who? 
@_date: 2015-09-21 21:13:50
Yes. Also I did a test some time ago and paid people a small amount of money in bitcoin to provide me different shopping receipts. This way I try to figure out how I can help [this]( kind of business to grow.
@_date: 2015-04-26 19:06:39
yes, more than sure someone needs them more than me at this time.   
@_date: 2015-04-26 19:04:54
@_date: 2015-04-13 23:34:25
it doesn't matter if price is dropping or not, newcomers like bitcoin but they don't want to spend their fiat for it. instead building new exchanges, give them something for work to earn some bits.
@_date: 2015-09-21 18:11:17
I see an app installed on my phone that can help me accomplish anything, anything with bitcoin, no matter that I need something in real life or just a piece of information online. 
For example why should I try to convince my buddy to take bitcoin in his restaurant when there are no people spending t? Instead I would rather open the app and let the crowd know that I'm willing to pay $2 for each guy who visit my buddy's restaurant and send me a picture of his dinner receipt. 
@_date: 2015-09-13 22:49:41
"No, ATMs will just bring bitcoin into the operators wallets and will feed their greed for money. It will go mainstream when we will truly understand how many things you can accomplish with it and understand that the key is not to drive 10 miles to pay 5% to change bitcoin when maybe next door is a guy who 1% of that sale will bring him food for his family."
@_date: 2015-09-22 00:02:46
If I tell you nothing, would you even listen what I want to do? 
@_date: 2015-09-21 20:06:47
Buy me a mouse and I pay you bitcoin +3%.
@_date: 2015-09-22 01:14:35
If someone will come tomorrow and bring you cash for your coins what the extra % that you are willing to pay for this service?
@_date: 2015-09-21 23:34:45
See in my mind is only one thing: fuck I can buy cocaine with bitcoin but I can't pay by bills or I can't buy [cacao]( because nobody have interest to build a marketplace for needs. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 00:29:47
No, even if the concept have some similar things, it won't work for what i have in mind.
First of all it should be a mobile app, something more like [magic]( but instead having a team of [trained people]( who get paid in fiat, better have a community who hunt for bits instead of karma. 
@_date: 2015-09-17 01:01:45
@_date: 2015-09-22 01:26:56
Yes I can get your point.

@_date: 2015-09-22 01:36:29
Yes show your id and also the last 4 digits of the the credit card. It will be to expensive for a scammer to make profit by spending money on fake id and credit card, more than that you can ask him to show you a second card with his name on it, for extra security.
@_date: 2015-09-21 19:50:02
I see it different, I don't need to discover those inefficiencies and problems, I just need to build an environment where people can write their needs, give them value with bitcoin and allow others people to compete to win those bits.
I don't need to drive 30 miles and pay %10 fees to change my coins into fiat when definitely on my street there are at least 3 people that never heard about bitcoin but for a $100 profit they are willing to open a coinbase account and bring me cash to my door.
@_date: 2016-10-04 12:21:22
@_date: 2015-09-28 00:18:30
Probably you know about localbitcoins and this is not an option, or is to complex for your client. I would like to understand something, maybe in the future this won't be an issue. 
So the perfect scenario for you would be a person to meet your client, get the cash and transfer bitcoin to you?
@_date: 2015-09-21 23:17:02
You focus on businesses, but we don't need them take our bitcoin. I don't give a shit if Dell to takes my Bitcon or not, as long as I can find someone to spend his fiat buy my laptop and deliver it to my door. All i can guarantee are money in escrow to cover the laptop value and some bonus for this great service. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 00:56:43

A really good way to advertise such a business is to return 2-5% from their monthly rate in Bitcoin. This way when bitcoin will grow, they will be able to buy their own apartment with that shitty crazy drug internet money, returned from their landlord.

About ordering them from Amazon, I saw that one item is not available for shipping to Romania. Easiest way for me would be to find someone in Netherlands or UK even to order them online or locally from a shop and deliver them to RO. 
@_date: 2015-10-18 18:56:27
dude, your business will soon die, there will come new people that will consider 3% fair enough to drive all day trough the city and do trades with people, without ID scan. the most amazing thing is that even the ATM operator from my city started to do business directly with people who come to use the ATM.

@_date: 2015-10-17 16:29:29
There are some,  cointasker, bittask, coinworker etc, but none of them work like this. 
- We have the community who own Bitcoin and can't wait to spend them
- we have those fellows that don't wanna spend their fiat for bitcoin but will work for bitcoin
- and finally and the most important ones, we have millions of people worldwide who look for extra money, who won't fucking care if they  earn GBP, EUR, BTC if at the end there will be USD in their bank.
Let's create a bridge between all those worlds and things will grow in Bitcoin. It's true that a decentralized solution for this and some smarts contracts would be great for this.
@_date: 2015-11-10 04:39:25

ok, not sure if AFF is a scam or not, but I see many users having an account there.
I have in mind a Chicks for Geeks platform, where you can spend your bitcoin to discuss with girls or why not, to find one to join you at the next bitcoin conference, this if you're not idiot enough to send the money and get scammed

I don't see a future for those ATM businesses. Why the fuck to agree to pay a % for shit services plus couple of miles drive.
You want to make money by helping people buying selling Bitcoin? No problem, from now on, I don't want to travel 30 miles to use the ATM and pay %7, I want you to come to my door and make the exchange, if I still pay lot of fees at least to worth it.

don't know where you live, but it seams that here people still ask me for my wifi password when come to visit me. anyway, tor think is a good way to route traffic, but please don't underestimate  people who want bitcoin, and if they can obtain $5 by mining some shitcoin, more then sure that will bring their old router back to life.

Think about this. You have $1 and want to buy a great gift for your friend. 
You make the post, lot of people from all around the world will come with ideas and at the end you can have a custom gift from the other side of the earth, all paid with Bitcoin.
The idea is to create an environment where you can allow users to create businesses on top of Bitcoin.

I don't sell them, I just allow other people to use my phone and I receive Bitcoin as bonus. 
@_date: 2015-10-27 13:44:41
I'm a dude and that's why I say, rather then paying fees to a LB trader I would prefer to pay them to other guys who are interested in bitcoin. 
I'm lazy and since bitcoin, I prefer to pay a fee instead doing couple of posts and waiting for their reply.

And what does Magic for the Bitcoin community? Are those people working for Magic paid in Bitcoin? Is is available worldwide?
@_date: 2015-10-21 23:57:06
Tell me one thing that can't do with bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-22 15:51:03
True, but soon enough for each proxy a new business will appear.
@_date: 2015-10-19 08:36:57
Check my post history, i've already tried to explain how such a platform should work. First don't think it's needed to have up / down votes. 
Post are displayed online only if the OP lock an amount of BTC in escrow, this way users will know for sure that the money exist and if their answers are useful, they will get rewarded some bits.
If you put the voting system on such platform, my opinion it will get abused. If not, you will have a list of posts that you can filter by amount of BTC, time when was submitted, how many people got involved in solving it. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 23:50:51
big enough
@_date: 2015-10-17 14:59:56
Yes they do, but instead using trained agents, let's spend those coins with people who want to get into Bitcoin. Think about, most people don't want to spend their fiat to buy coins but would gladly share some of their knowledge or skills to earn them.
I bet that each request that goes to Magic can be solved cheaper and faster on this kind of app. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 06:59:59
Good point. +1

If you're interested about bitcoin you can read by yourself, if you want to change bitcoin to cash, it's possible, but there is not an easy way for the most blockheads to do it, but trust me exist and if you want, we can test it.
@_date: 2016-05-04 14:34:52
well, you don't need bitcoin for this, just stop eating and your ass will be just fine.
@_date: 2016-10-31 23:05:58
Haha no, 
I've seen your product a couple of weeks ago, it's interesting and I'm sure there will be couple of people buying it. 
If you want to sell me something you need to build something else and target a different category of customers. I would love to have a chat with you and the guy from cryptosteel. I've managed to bring him on Telegram, so if you have time please pm your telegram username.

Yes this was also my first believe, but is wrong. 
Imagine that pp became so popular because of eBay and Bitcoin will do the same, because of seal oil.
@_date: 2015-10-17 19:23:37
If you understand and it's a good idea, please help me to find more people to be aware of it and maybe someone it's willing to do it. 
At this time have no more Bitcoin left, lost last of them by getting too greedy on x100, but I have a decent income and hopefully I will be able to invest couple of Bitcoin monthly for someone to try to make this happen.

I'm not sure if marketplace is the correct name for this because something like this was never build, and when I hear marketplace I imagine a place when if I need something I will have to search for it, and this need to be changed, we need to focus on people who own Bitcoin and make things easier for them. 
Look for what I would spend some Bitcoin right now. I just eat something that a friend said is total vegan, but cooked by his wife and I'm totally sure she placed some eggs inside. I would love to spend some Bitcoin, for the community to help me find a lab around and send a sample for test, like that lab from Spain where you send drugs for test.
It can be done and if you want let's use this scenario to test the concept. 
$10 for person who find the lab in my area able to do the tests
$20 bonus for person who deliver the food to the lab
And think about, this can be solved remote from a person from Australia, he just need to Google my area for the lab, pay the tests and the courier with his credit card and task solved. He will get the value of the transaction in BTC + some bonus.
More than that, the courier can see my request and directly come with and offer for me, it can be another business that can start on top of the app.
Monday when corporate workers get back at their desks, I will make a post locally trying to find someone to take my Bitcoin and test the food.

I'll join, but just transfer my bits to and make Copay great again.
@_date: 2016-07-21 07:01:27
I don't argue about that, they will lose their jobs but just before this happen, I want those people to be aware of better money and instead hunting dollars per hour to do new jobs for bits per minute. 
@_date: 2015-10-31 11:47:43
Yes mam, got that from the first time.

How come that we need those improvements exactly now when the price is mooning and why can't we wait one more year to see exactly what will happen with adoption. Please don't tell me that Bitcoin is not able to last 2-3 more years as is today.
