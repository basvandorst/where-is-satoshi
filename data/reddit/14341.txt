I'm not talking specifically about compact blocks or xthin. If an alternative client is trying to break consensus rules, it is **technically** working on different protocol.
Your analogy on bittorrent is wrong because that protocol has its own specifications for alternative clients to follow. Once you break it with your 'client', you have another file sharing protocol and it is not compatible with other clients.

Your on-chain tx always need miners to pickup. You’re speaking like governments can’t regulate mining pools?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:08:52
A valid block’s hash must be produced using the hash of previous block, and must not contain any invalid transaction. If there are two block mined same time, one which is broastcasted slower must be orphaned. 
Pending transaction will remains in mempool until it is picked, or expired after a predetermined period of time. Yes miners can pick lower fee tx over higher-paid tx, or they can even pick no tx at all (empty block), but that would undermine their economic incentive.

This question need a lot more detailed and complicated answer. In short, mining nodes have solve math problem to satisfy given conditions (previous block hashes, current difficulty...) to get the reward (currently 12.5 BTC a block).


Yes mining node can pick whatever from mempool. Normally, transactions with highest fee per byte of tx size are automatically selected so miner can get most reward out of a block.


Yes if your transaction is valid with current consensus rules. Otherwise your mined block gets rejected by other nodes in network.

I’ve never used any hardware wallet because i feel satisfied with my cold storage set up, but I heard good reviews about Trezor and Ledger Nano S. They are straight forward and easy to use. Your private keys would never be leaked outside of secure enviroment, even if you plug your hardware wallet into a compromised computer. 
Both devices has open source firmware, you should try to flash device by yourself with latest opensource firmware before using.

Brute force is only helpful if there are few characters left need to guess and you already know position of remaining characters. You remember almost nothing for a quite long password.
Even if cracking was possible, we had no chance to help because we don’t have **actual wallet** to test against. We would end up creating a list of billions and billions possibilities and send it to you so you have to try one by one manually! Sound impractical, right?
Also, how do you know “partial master private key”? I can’t imagine some one that back up partial of privkey but not whole! This isn’t going to help either, it does not relate to password. Password is just used to encrypt your private key on hard disk. If you have entire master privkey, you can just easily restore wallet without even knowing the password you lost.

The entire reason for Bitcoin to exist is removing trusted third party, such as Coinbase. Unless you're a day trader, it is advised to not keep your coins in any exchange, no matter how secure they are. You're not actually holding your coins, you're just trusting that Coinbase won't be hacked or run away with your coins. *"If you don't control your private keys, you don't control your coins"*.


Set up your own wallet that only store private keys on a [secure] device belonging to you, preferably a cold storage. This practice is not easy for average people, so they're advised to use a hardware wallet such as Trezor.

You're misinformed. Segwit did not compress transactions, in fact it increase tx size very slightly.
In Segwit 1MB limit still exists but only counted for non-witness data, total size of non-witness and witness data can exceed 1MB.

Blockstream has nothing to do with miners, because Blockstream does not oversee protocol maintenance.
Also, Bitcoin was never designed to serve miner's interest. If miners refuse to adopt new innovations they will be eventually obsoleted and removed once users migrating from Bitcoin.

LN would not be more centralized than Bitcoin mining already are. Surely you could have much more hubs to choose than the number of mining pools you can pick to include your transaction.

Indeed, but XT' approach to scale is wrong. Citing Moore's law which had been wrong once is a dumb idea.
To truly scale, bitcoin need payment channel and subchains built on top of main chain. I was an advocate for BIP  101 long ago but now i believe Core's roadmap for scalability is much better.

F2pool and Antpool has been widely believed to be under control of same people, for example [this]( and [this](
I wouldn't be surprise if F2pool will be next pool to signal BU. Soon Antpool/Bitmain will have to reveal themselves during this debacle, their datacenters are owning more than 50% of total hashing power. This means 'miner support' for BU is actually just Jihan Wu and few other Chinese guys.
@_date: 2017-03-13 22:36:11
1) In which written proposal BU intend to fork with 'more than half' of hash rate? I'm not asking how you define majority. I'm asking a) which *quantitative* metrics BU will use to determine **safety** of hark fork; and b) which reasoning BU will use to convince market those metrics is valid. You can't answer, because there is none. I bet the only answer you could find from your fellow BU supporters is 'it is ready when miner think it is ready' huh?
2) I'm not trying to prove that minority chain is longest chain. My point is that if minority chain *survive*, the fork is failed. A hard fork is only smooth and successful if it maintain unanimity (no chain split).
I guess you don't have ability to follow the discussion here. Your comments answer nothing.

Unanimity of blockchain is one of properties giving Bitcoin value. A chain split would destroy that


Difficulty of minor chain can be intervened by a fork so it can survive. Ethereum's case study proved that mining follows market's decision, not the otherwise. ETC chain were supposed to decease, until Poloniex suddenly added that market.


Ahh, the same old arguments "no incentive to do that", "no rational miner would attack"... You are just ignoring problem and hope it go away. Same defending arguments from BU supports when they was asked about possible attack vector introduced in "emergent consensus". Have you ever heard of Murphy's law: *Whatever can go wrong, will go wrong* ? Bitcoin was never designed to blindly trust miners "not to attack network", that's why we have nodes enforcing rules.
And don't forget, it doesn't need any malicious miner to fork the network. All it needs is an incident just like what happened at bitcoin.com pool.


BU doesn't even have any threshold, it can literally fork any minute. Last time i checked, ETH rushed fork were initially supported by more than 90% hashing power.
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:05:40
Botnet mining is a finite resource, and actually neutral. Monero has CPU-friendly POW and it is doing fine. Underlying tech is more important than POW algo.

1) You didn't answer my question. Which amount is considered 'majority'? Clearly you don't even know, you can't even find it anywhere because there is no proper plan for BU to fork. And, would that 'majority' be safe enough? Ethereum incident proved that even 90% isn't safe. There is no censensus if market and users opinions are ignored.
2) Minority chain can fork itself with an update to adjust diff, it will survive eventually.

Those fee collected would cost much more because LN is only practical solution for mass scaling. Large transactions would still want to be mined on-chain and these txs are willing to pay a large fee. Think about on-chain tx as wire transfer and LN as credit card.

Except that "the rest of BU miners" also under control of Bitmain. Just think about it, we have only one company producing mining equipments for everyone.

And how do you know if "network is ready"? BU has no threshold/grace period to trigger the fork. There is absolutely NO metrics/statistics to indicate "safety" of the fork. That's definition of hostility. Even &gt;90% of hashrate does not make a fork safe, Ethereum's failed hard fork is an example. Market, not miner, will determines minority chain to survive or not.

Double spending 0-conf is not difficult as you think, you don't need miners colluding with you. Creating double spend tx using same input with higer fee could guarantee a significant success rate.

1) And how are they going to fork, obviously their plan is not only "signaling". My concern is about safety (a.k.a no chain split) of the fork as BU supporters promoted, because there is absolutely no quantitative measurement of "safety".
2) I were referring to rushed hard fork in response to DAO hack, which was pushed by Ethereum foundation as "safe", "no split" It was supported by more than 90% hash rate, but minority chain (ETC) ended up surviving. ATH in term of BTC is still far away.

2MB is fine, but it wouldn't solve scaling problem. The concern is that there will me massive blocksize increases come after that because Gavin always want to put every transaction into main chain.

RBF was in original Satoshi client, it was disabled in 0.3.x and only activated again in 0.12. Before 0.12, double spending did not disappear and 0-confirmation transactions also was not safer. Not to mention that miners could have been running customized RBF all the time without us knowing. So no, Peter Todd's RBF doesn't make accepting 0-confirmation transactions more risky, it has been always risky.

Handled by accepting them into blocks? Attacker literally pays nothing by spamming 0 sat/B transactions. Node operators are the losers here by wasting bandwidth/CPU/storage. If attacks persists, they will eventually have to upgrade hardware or turn them off permanently.
Considering node operators receive absolutely zero from running nodes, they has little incentives to upgrade. Only people thinking seriously about decentralization will try to run a full node, those people aren't going to accept inflation of blocksize by pushing spam attack.

Real world demand for bitcoin will be digital gold and uncensored payment network.

If you want bitcoin to compete with centralized network like Visa in term of efficiency, you've chosen wrong solution.

How does the fact that LN is not an investment could sabotage its usage? You need a valid argument to support your claim "nobody want to use LN because it is not an investment". 
You need to "lock" your money in a bank in order to use your Visa.
There was plenty people locked their money in e-gold, Liberty Reserve... because they can transact freely despite that these payment methods are not investment ... until the owners was arrested.

Because all altcoins are centralized with some sort of "dictatorship", they can push changes faster. One characteristic of decentralized system is its resistance to change. We did not hard fork internet from IPv4 to IPv6 simply because we can't.

You guys are hypocritical. There are these threads that you complain about miners loosing income due to transaction limit. But there are also other threads that you complain about increased tx fee due to exactly same transaction limit.
Also, your argument is flawed by looking into security model purely from miner's perspective. As I said somewhere in this thread, Bitcoin was never designed to serve miner's interest. Security of network is directly affected by strength of ecosystem including market and adoption of the currency. Simple logic is higher adoption, higher price would attract more investment in mining to secure the network. Failure to adopt new innovations could cost Bitcoin  crytocurrency and consequently miner's investment could totally be destroyed.

Sacrificing innovation for the interests of miners is like banning CD/DVD to protect interests of VHS sellers. Fortunately, Bitcoin is not designed to serve miners. Any altcoins attemping to attract miners instead of users has failed miserably, vertcoin is an example.
Talking about as "long term" as you mentioned, SegWit/LN could evolve to its own trustless payment system or could be adapted into any altcoin. If that scenario happened, Bitcoin would be obsoleted and miners would be finacially suffered much more than choosing to adapt innovations.

You argued that nobody want to lock their coin in LN because "LN is not an investment like Bitcoin", remember? I were simply giving an example that Bitcoin is also a payment network, in which a set of users seek to overcome restrictions by turning fiat into bitcoin and then fiat again. So again, where is the source of only "15 nutters" doing so?
The fact that you don't even know who is lending your money is quite concerning. How do you pay your credit card balance at the end of month? You always need to "lock" your assets in some form, so your bank can confidently let you pay later. And don't forget debit card, you need to lock your money in a checking account so your debit card can work.

How many times you have repeated these words in this thread? You can't call them "centralized" if you can transact in **trustless** manner. If LN was indeed centralized people would rather continue using Bitpay or Coinbase than waiting for it.
LN is truly innovative and it will happen eventually without depending on Bitcoin miner's decision, either in Bitcoin or any altcoin or even its own settlement network. Bitcoin was never designed to serve the interests of miner. In fact, miners would totally lose their investment by refusing to adapt new technology into protocol, making Bitcoin obsoleted for anyone to hold.

No it doesn't. Other exchanges can only switch the ownership of USDT from one user to another. They do not convert USDT to USD. Only Tether could do that, because Tether is issuer of USDT.
If Bitfinex/Tether did not have fiat they're supposed to have, there are always people holding bag, and price between USD and USDT exchanges would be diverged heavily. We have yet to see that.
Kraken's USDT/USD pair has been always there since before Bitfinex/Tether banking problem. USDT is still tracking USD pretty well.

Almost every newcomer think they're *too late* for Bitcoin and try to outsmart others by jumping into alts. But they forget that there are a lot of people are doing the same so they're not outsmarting anyone.
Even Bitcoin maximalists (including myself) invest in alts but only for increasing their BTC stash.
Almost every crypto chat group I joined only talks about alts.
I have a group of friends investing in crypto. I am the only one I know having majority of assets in Bitcoin. All my friends invest heavily in altcoin in searching for *the next Bitcoin*. This mentality made alts market cap jumped from about 10% - 20% of BTC market cap one year ago to be on par with BTC.

If they wanted to pump BTC with non-existent fiat, why don't they make that internally winthin Bitfinex so nobody can know instead of making public transaction in Tether blockchain? I don't think Bitfinex is stupid enough to choose an even worse method than what MtGox did.

Indeed, to achieve maximum efficiency LN network will naturally converge into few big hubs. However, the network is designed that these hubs are trustless (or minimal trust required other people would say). In worst case scenario in which the hub disappear, the damage to users would be very minimal. If this scenario happens to traditional, trusted payment services (like Coinbase or Bitpay), users would lose all the money.

So what's the reason to waste money building Asicboost circuitry into every existing modern Antminer? Just to mine worthless testnet coin? You must be delusional to believe that.
Talking about more evidence, Antpool has been mining many blocks with symptom matching the usage of Asicboost, including weird transaction shuffling in blocks and empty blocks containing only few transactions:


You're talking about entirely different subject called Antbleed, not Asicboost. Yes the code is old, but if Bitmain wanted to shut down your miner, they would only need to set up a live domain matching the hardcoded remote server in the firmware. This server could literally take them only few minutes to setup.

As far as i know, Confidential transaction hide amount of tx while Zerocash hide everything, including inputs and outputs (basically whole blockchain is unreadable).

Bitcoin is trustless by design, mining centralization is a weakness of protocol but that doesn't mean Bitcoin is not trustless. Unlike Zerocash which require trusted setup. Furthermore, not only setup process requiring trust, the verification of generated initial parameters also need massive amount of time and computing power which cannot be afforded by average users (i.e. more trust required).
Zerocash is built upon completely new, unproven technology unlike Bitcoin which was built with proven cryptography at the moment of its release. I like Zerocash, it would be great as a mean of sneaking money around without anyone knowing, but probably not in term of investment because there are to much risk involved compared to other cryptocurrencies.

You clearly have little technical knowledg (just like most of desperate forkers). Witness data are not accounted at all!

if you pay low fee then your transaction is not in priority to be mined.

@_date: 2015-11-05 17:50:47
Bitcoin can handle only 3 transactions per second because of 1MB blocksize limit. There have been several solutions proposed but debates led to nowhere due to conflict of interest between core developers as well as mining pools, big services ....
Bitcoin at current capacity is not ready for mass adoption.

No they can't. However if you include inputs from both addresses in one transaction i think someone might be able guess that those 2 addresses came from same wallet.
@_date: 2016-10-20 18:37:15
You simply dont understand. The point of capacity increase is letting transactions mined at cheaper fee. Even if I am the only one sending SegWit tx, I would still get full benefit.
@_date: 2017-05-16 18:16:16
I don't think that will largely affect their bussiness. Xapo is mostly used as debit card, not as a hot BTC wallet. I send some BTC to Xapo and spend them through their card, which mean i only need to pay fee for incomming tx once every few months.
@_date: 2015-11-05 21:42:09
Actually original Bitcoin has no blocksize limit. Satoshi introduced 1MB cap as temporary spam prevention with idea that it can be lifted in future. However scaling Bitcoin isn't simple as increasing the limit. Large block size will lead to more centralization of network because much more resource is required to run nodes. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:21:01
Different activating mechanism. Current segwit implenmation is triggered by 95% hashing power to minimize disruption. UASF doesn't care about any supporting metric, it activates purely based on block height.

Depend on how correctly that Metcalfe law is applied. I see some ‘analytics’ passing around but i thinj it is wrong because:
1) they ignore the fact that Bitcoin transactions are frequently batched. One tx can have multiple output to multiple recipients. A withdrawal from an exchange is usually a big tx
2) they ignore off-chain transactions (such as LN or Coinbase/Bitpay offchain tx, even trades within exchanges can be seen as offchain tx.)

Reduced UTXO set is another benefit but does bot relate to the topic we're discussing here (benefit on reduced fee). It would not be wise if you're trying to reference something you dont understand.
Miners usually select transaction based on highest fee **per kb**. Segwit does not change this policy but it reduce overall size of tx by separating witness data, hence it reduce overall fee.

@_date: 2017-05-05 21:09:35
Yes it is. You will need to restart entire process of proposing, coding, peer review, testing, deploying, signaling. Then you need a sufficient amount of time for majority of network, including economic nodes to prepare for the hard fork. By 'sufficient period' I certainly mean much more than only '28 days grace period' proposed in XT/Classic. At the end, you'll need at least 2 years to have SW+2MB HF activated, why don't just tell miners to activate existing solution?
SW+2MB is just a political compromise. We don't solve technical problems by using political solution.
@_date: 2016-10-21 00:46:16


Actually it does. Limited capacity results in transactions has to compete to each other (in fee) to get included to blocks. Assuming fee needed for my tx is $0.1, same tx in SegWit format would need only $0.05 because witness data is not counted toward transaction size. That's why I said Segwit allows me to get benefit without relying on other users.


SegWit does not remove that power from miners.

I'm not sure you're really stupid or just pretending to be stupid. UASF a.k.a flag day upgrade was traditional upgrading mechanism for bitcoin-qt/core, introduced by Satoshi since day 1 of bitcoin. It does not depend on any metric to upgrade, new functions was triggered purely by planned block height. It was actually Core recently introduced hashrate-based upgrade.
@_date: 2017-05-17 00:45:39


Ironically, the people you think that 'crippled Bitcoin' tend to be Bitcoin maximalist. Meanwhille the crowd saying Bitcoin is crippled is pumping alts in the same time.


Only in you need to scale Bitcoin to world adoption as a polular daily payment network for consumer. But we're not reaching that level anytime soon.


I've seen this argument hundreds of times here for more than a year. Therefore i'll repeat my counter argument: Segwit allows user to have benefit without depending on how many peers has upgraded.


Nobody EVER argued removing hardfork to larger blocksize. Have you read Bitcoin Core roadmap? The debate is not about whether to do hardfork, but how to do it. Certainly pushing a HF within 28 days is reckless.


A truly decentralized network is difficult to upgrade. Altcoins can hard fork easily because their development and network is centralized in which founders can easily shove any upgrade to community without being questioned. Recent Monero hardfork had to be pushed within 15 days from notice and that show how centralized they are. That's not a victory you should celebrate. (Disclaimer: I am a Monero users since when it was launched in 2014, so i'm not fudding it, just trying to be neutral).
Resistance to changes is inheritant property of decentralized platform. For example: SMTP is still most popular mailling protocol despite being obsoleted, it popularity grew to a level that you simply cannot upgrade without breaking compatibility. TCP/IP is also decentralized that you can't 'hardfork' to remove IPv4 for IPv6 because that would kick millions of devices out of internet. Instead, IPv6 was treated as extention of IPv4, this is definition of softfork. I hope this example gives you a perspective how upgrading Bitcoin in future should work, as it continue expanding and decentralizing.

We dont have factual data of node count from 2010/1011 but a quick googling shows that number of node in 2013/1014 is indeed significantly higher than now. This is probably because many home nodes was forced offline due to ever-increasing required bandwidth and diskspace.
Pruning introduced in Bitcoin Core has brought up the count a bit, but still nowhere near 3-4 years ago.
@_date: 2016-05-20 22:53:30


Wrong. Merchants can still accept 0-conf transactions if those tx do not have RBF flag enabled. In case tx having RBF flag, merchant can just wait 1 confirmation before delivering product. Btw, 0-conf has never been secure as Peter Todd proved with his 'malicious' doublespend.py.
@_date: 2017-05-17 01:02:07
Outdated arguments again. Diskspace was never road block to larger block size. CPU and bandwidth are the concerns. You won't being able to do on-chain scaling without fixing quadratic hashing first (Segwit does). Otherwise you'll open a massive attack vector to the network because node's CPU will be bottlenecked.

You're wrong. Visa has peak capacity of 47,000 tx per second. You would need 8GB blocks to achieve this on-chain throughput. Let's skip hard disk capacity, because that's easy part. The difficulties are: a) network bandwidth to serve 8 GB block every 10 mins, to multiple peers **concurrently**. Price for this kind of bandwidth a year would much larger than 10k; b) CPU resource to verify 8GB block before next block arrive (which could be within seconds).
Conclusion: 10k PC wouldn't do the job.

Another stupid argument. Users has obvious incentives to upgrade wallet to have lower fee. Meaning it wont take years as P2SH upgrade.

Uhm what? You was trying to defend ABC because 'there are alternatives to Gitian' and 'no need to copy Core'. But you failed to show which alternative practice that ABC is using at the moment.
This research task seems to be yours rather than mine.

not FUD, a guy was recently arrested with the information provided by Coinbase. If you read an exchange's TOS carefully you'll realize your privacy won't be guaranteed.
Not to mention in case of security breach, your personal and financial information would be sold or leaked. Remember Mt Gox database leak?
@_date: 2016-07-02 22:15:53
Most of Classic supporters has flocked to Eth, including Classiic founder Toomin. It's not a surprise seeing why they're so actively spreading FUD about Bitcoin's future.

A well planned hard fork with overwhelming consensus: yes.
A rushed and controversial hard fork: no. I dont want Bitcoin to br splitted.
@_date: 2016-07-22 03:16:47
Woah so unknown miners are now the ones ruling the court and deciding your permission to divorce? That's totally revolutionising our world /s

Yeah they have been bored since 200s i guess.
@_date: 2017-07-27 20:38:21
Because "the other side" can't produce any innovation on their own other than just changing blocksize, they decided to fire core by copying their works. That seems to be a good strategy /s
@_date: 2016-07-24 00:12:46
Then you misunderstood.
@_date: 2016-07-29 03:56:46
Fungiblity means all coins are treated equally. Your problem is the fee, every tx has to pay fee. You fee would be too high because you collected too many dust, it is totally unrelated to fungiblity.
@_date: 2016-07-29 16:20:28
The measure i'm using? Security, decentralisation, unambiguity, immutability. None of them are "working fine". 
@_date: 2016-07-22 12:18:34


Except that you have invested so heavily in DAO.


Bitcoin do get the consensus, the consensus not to fork!

@_date: 2017-05-17 00:22:37
I dont need to read your comments again because i know perfectly what you means. Popular wallets are ready for segwit, so no need to abuse the argument 'but wallet need to upgrade'.
More importantly, I also added that in case nothing is upgraded, you will still be able to transact on segwit-activated chain while the HF requires nodes to upgrade. That is advantage of being backward-compatible.

No brigading needed when you have voting bot.

Yesterday Brian made a blog post saying two chain existing is totally fine!!! So calm down everyone, Coinbase have everything under control!!! 
@_date: 2016-07-22 03:43:21
Ah this stupid comparison again. Bitcoin had a bug, but DAO's hack has nothing to do with Ethereum security. Why would a fork needed to fix just one utility built on top of it? Bitcoin did not fork to fix Silk road, Mt Gox, Bitstamp, Cryptsy.... even when some Core developer lost money in Gox. Ethereum, however, forked just because Foundation members personally invested in DAO. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 13:31:44
Only coins generated from block  is certainly attributed to Satoshi. From which he sent a transaction to Hal. Other early blocks were likely mined by him, but not 100% sure.
@_date: 2016-07-28 21:42:51
The only poll that matter is percentage of hashrate voicing support, at this moment there are roughly 3% of hashrate doing so. 
@_date: 2016-07-28 00:01:45
TL;DR: Brian admits he was wrong on analysing the risk of mETH hard fork but still claims that the fork was successful and both ethereum chain existing is totally fine (wtf ??)
@_date: 2016-07-29 12:43:12
So they can keep customer's ETC and sell them on other exchanges for their own benefit? That's definition of stealing.
@_date: 2016-07-27 16:35:06
The tweet reminds me of how Brian Armstrong was bragging that classic 0.11.2 is most popular node software. These guys has history of being proven wrong quickly. I like how rich non-cryptographers pretending that they understand Bitcoin and trying to influence its development.
@_date: 2016-07-31 16:20:10
Best practice would be transferring your coins to new HD wallet. 
@_date: 2016-07-29 01:06:14
That's not a fungiblity problem. You have too many inputs leading to enormous transaction size.
@_date: 2016-07-29 23:55:06
Neither ETH nor ETC worth the investment for Bitcoin maximalists.
@_date: 2017-05-13 22:48:32
The second block in quick succession would not be full, but you still need your CPU to verify first block (8GB) BEFORE this second block arrive, right?
@_date: 2017-05-17 00:01:57
You're wrong again. HF requires electrum nodes to upgrade or wallet get kicked out of network. Segwit SF does not require that. If you upgrade you get lower fee. If your wallet or some electrum nodes you're connecting doesnt upgrade, you're still be able to transact.
Since segwit is also a capacity increase at roughly double size, it does reduce fee. 1Mb to include same highest tx fee while remaining 1mb will pick txs with lower fee from mempool. Overall it significantly reduce required fee. I've never argued that Segwit will clear mempool (which also include no fee spamming txs). I'm not that stupid to want mempool cleared.
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:48:22
That's why I said good luck convincing market to buy their chain.
@_date: 2016-07-24 21:23:03
Mining pool is fine, the problem is centralization of mining hardware manufacturing. Still, POW is best choice of distribution. 
@_date: 2016-07-30 03:03:33
72 millions to be exact, if you combine both ICO and dev premine amount.
@_date: 2016-07-30 03:00:56
Unambiguity: now there are two chain instead of one.
Immutability: The bail out pushed by Vitalik and crew proved that smart contract is not actually machine-driven as promised. It can be intervened by human.
Security: Both ethereum chain is now under replay attack.
@_date: 2016-07-06 14:54:13
Circle also has to comply with same regulations, but the complaints is much less than Coinbase. The reason must be something else.
@_date: 2016-07-28 21:54:00
Ring signature is interesting, but the bloating issue due to large transaction size come with it make scaling way more difficult. I hold some Monero and can say that the blockchain is already occupying nearly 20GB of my diskspace without any real usage. Just imaging how much diskpace and bandwidth requirement would be if Monero has same transaction rate as Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 06:21:36
So i should change 300 to 500, ok?

I was talking about 4% hash rate support for Bitcoin Classic fork. You must have problem with reading and understanding.
@_date: 2016-07-28 21:46:27
I don't understand how blockchain is splitted, no longer unambiguous, under threat of replay attack but these guys keep assuring people that it's fine.
Ironically, before the fork happened Vitalik and his crew even made a series of blog posts saying HF is not dangerous, minor chain wouldn't be existing!!!
@_date: 2016-07-29 16:21:27
Did you forget that Bitcoin Classic is already available to miners?
@_date: 2017-06-14 17:30:29
And how does forking into third chain as Bitmain planning would 'prevent the attack from BIP148'?

Your analogy has proved that Ethereum's smart is even worse than regular contract we already have in real life. Since VB and his crew are police and judge, both at the same time! Is that what you call "enforcing property rights"?
VB and his mates in the effort of saving their personal investment in DAO, has showed us that "machine-driven contract" is bullshit.

It is difficult to spot accumulation just by looking at volume since vast majority of volume are made up by day-trading activities.
@_date: 2016-07-30 21:27:03
I doubt they are insolvent just because of leaking unknown amount of ETC. They're a big company anyway so they can purchase ETC from market if customers demand to withdraw them. Still, Coinbase made many bad predictions and management, especially relating to Ethereum hard fork.

@_date: 2016-07-24 00:09:59
He personally want to switch. But he won't because:
1. He knows that there is more than enough hash rate preventing the fork to happen.
2. Majority of miners supports Core roadmap to scaling. Even at the most classic-friendly pool, core voting still dominate.
Also, from technical perspective 2mb block limit would be meaningless when SW provide roughly same capacity increase as one of its benefits. All the talk from the other side is purely political.

Authy is much better and compatible with any service using Google Authenticator. It also allows you to have online backup.

Payment processors would never been abused by RBF tx if they pay attention to RBF flag of a tx.
@_date: 2017-06-10 21:26:01
Increasing of tx in altcoins caused by increasing price and speculative hype. It does not mean actual commercial transactions are migrating into other chains.
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:53:08
That would require a centralized authority/service to verify that you are actually dead. Still not a trustless system we want.
Our best scenario at the moment is split your seed in half. Give your wife/children a half and remaining to your lawyer. When you are dead, your lawyer must give another half to your wife. However, if your wife and lawyer are fucking each other or colluding together, they can steal your coins without you being dead yet.
@_date: 2017-06-19 06:23:13
I heard so since more than a year. If people leaving really resulted in higher price, more people should leave!
@_date: 2016-07-31 16:54:57
"5 miners" is over exaggeration. Mining pools is not problem, without them the chance of finding a block in solo mining would be like lottery. The problem is hardware manufacturing which is very centralized. This mean even CPU friendly POW would eventually lead to same problem because there are only few large chip manufacturers in the world.

60 million premined for ICO and 12 million premined for devs.

If ETH flippenning is what it take for miners to acknowledge that Segwit is the only way forward, i'd welcome it.

If Bitcoin hadn't start to rally since 1 year ago, other coins wouldn't gain such market share.

You are only idiot here who didn't know that UASF a.k.a flag-day upgrade was a traditional method used by Satoshi from day 1. Hashrate-based upgrade was introduced by Core later.

Neither SW or 2mb fork are true scaling solution. SW is like prerequisite for LN.

Miner does not represent market, because they need market to survive. They are seller, market is buyer.
@_date: 2016-05-20 23:00:40
No, your point is that RBF kills 0-conf transactions while in fact it does not.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:51:09
You're free not to run their software, especially segwit.

If the scenario Bitmain pictures was indeed to happen, there would be only 2 chains: UASF and Bitmain's private mining chain, no legacy chain anymore. I fairly sure which chain market would choose as Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-28 22:32:58
Scaling, especially by increasing blocksize, has direct impact to decentralisation so my above comment remains relevant.
@_date: 2017-06-11 20:03:15
How does that conflict with my reply?

@_date: 2016-07-28 01:04:51
Brian is also touting that, but he seems to forget Ethereum is now fundamentally broken because of hard fork and it has yet being reflected by market.
@_date: 2017-06-14 16:08:22
Bitmain will hardfork only in case BIP148 success, meaning there is no legacy chain anymore.
@_date: 2018-12-27 15:42:38
There is nothing wrong with Electrum client of any platform. Apparently some rouge Electrum servers try to fool Electrum users with messages asking them to 'upgrade' into new wallet from a malicious source (not official electrum website or github repo). The user was naive enough to follow that instruction and installed malicious software, then he lost the private key.

Was you reading his blog (now inactive) last year? Every post contains double space. However if you look at HTML source, those was html tags, not actual double space because it was not possible typing double space in Wordpress. This means Craig purposely place those html tags there to clone Satoshi style. If he was real Satoshi, he wouldn't need to do such cheap trick.
