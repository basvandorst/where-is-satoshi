Austerity means lowering the deficit, nothing more, nothing less. Greece has achieved an extremely huge adjustment on that front, so big that it [tops all EU countries in terms of cyclically-adjusted primary surplus]( It is also by far the most austere in terms of [cumulative structural deficit reduction.](
But even if one were to accept your small government ideologically driven definition of austerity, you would still be wrong. [So far the vast majority of the the aforementioned adjustment was done not by tax increases but by cutting expenditure.](
Step out of your personal echochamber for a second and you'll realise that there's more to economics than "hurr durr cut taxes to get growth, we need smaller government". And then you might stop feeling the need to shoehorn your personal ideological crusade in matters where it's almost completely off-topic.

I'll give it a go too because honestly explanation is rubbish. 
Imagine a close friend of yours went a bit crazy during the sub-prime mortgage boom and with the encouragement of his bank took too many loans to buy real estate. When the market crashed his real estate lost a lot of value and suddenly he can't refinance his loans any more. So he comes to you and he asks for your help. 
Your response is to give him all the loans he needs to meet his debt payments for the bank. Why? Because you're a stakeholder at that bank yourself and you don't want the bank's balance sheet to take a hit. So you give him an extremely big loan and you tell him that in return he has to live a very austere lifestyle so he can pay you back. 
5 years later, he has sold his car, he stopped paying his health insurance and pawned almost everything he owns, all to meet your demands, but since he's in poor health and without a car he also lost his previous job so he now works at a fast food joint and makes much less money. Which means he still needs your loans to stay afloat. 
At this point, he no longer owes anything to the bank, he owes all his debt to you. You give him new loans every month, he immediately hands all the money right back to you as a debt payment and then you ask him to cut his expenses more because he's hurting your bottom line and you want to minimise the loans you give him. 
So he finally snaps and tells you that he needs debt relief and help to find a new job. These ludicrous demands cause you you to laugh in his face so he goes to his family and calls a vote: should they continue with this same plan for a few more decades or should they just stop paying you and face whatever consequences there may be?
PS: The analogy isn't perfect because sovereign debt is not the same as household debt, the structure of the euro plays a prominent role in the crisis etc etc... but it's good enough as a start.

I was always weirded out by the fact that bitcoin development was in the hands of a handful of developers that could do with it whatever they wanted. I guess it's the time of reckoning for that flaw.

That does not in any way refute my points above.

[From Wikipedia:](


But please, don't let facts and commonly accepted definitions get in the way of your mental gymnastics. Feel free to ignore them to make a petty ideological point. 


That would be an extreme version of austerity that when applied to a whole country in the best case would quickly make you lose the elections or if you're a dictator and there's no elections then you get a nice revolt and you get executed after a show trial. Plenty of examples throughout history, [here's my favourite](

In my story the guy is also running a deficit and he also has a fast increasing massive debt. Why? Because fiscal austerity in a flattened economy is self-defeating. [It's not some marxist leaflet saying that either, it's the freaking IMF.](
Here's some Greece stats I used as inspiration to write "he has sold his car, he stopped paying his health insurance and pawned almost everything he owns"
* cyclically adjusted fiscal deficit turned into a surplus on the back of a ‘world record beating’ 20% adjustment   
* Wages fell by 37%
* Pensions were reduced by up to 48%
* State employment diminished by 30%
* Consumer spending was curtailed by 33%
* Current account deficit dropped by 16%.
If anything my analogy is less harsh than reality.

I gave you the commonly accepted definition which is exactly what I said above. I don't understand why you're so outraged. That's what the word austerity means in the context of economic policy, I'm sorry it's not what you wanted but that's not my fault.

Don't bother. Most people here are minarchists or anarchocapitalists. The kind of crowd that buys gold, thinks fiat money is a conspiracy that will destroy everything and deflation is good for an economy. I sometimes wish there was a subreddit for discussing the bitcoin technology from the other end of the political spectrum. Oh well. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 15:42:19
Because deflation causes people's debts to stay the same in nominal terms but become bigger and bigger in real terms. How would lending money to investments work in a deflationary environment then? Would you have interest rates below zero? If you do that, then people will prefer to keep the money in  their bank/wallet rather than lend/invest it because that would by default give them a higher yield. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 17:13:06
It can, but then in aggregate, a lot of loans would not be able to be paid off because all the borrowers would have to compete with a decreasing pool of money to get the extra bit of money on top of what they were given. Does that make sense?

As someone who hates Apple and would never buy anything from that company, this thread and the "activism" it promotes is the worst I've ever seen on reddit.

I am only following bitcoin because I was expecting it would spawn things like your project. So you did well to post here. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 16:53:47
I don't see how "uncontrolled deflation" has anything to do with it. The point is that for a ton of things, the "how much you expect to make from this loan" would need be zero or negative interest in order to make sense and in that case you'll have no incentive whatsoever to lend the money because keeping it would be more valuable to you. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 16:22:35
Let me put it in a conversational style: Suppose we live in a deflationary environment, and you have a lot of money. You are thinking about lending someone some money. What interest do you ask for? 
If you ask for a positive interest, then their debt pile will grow fast in real terms. If you ask for a zero or negative interest, then you might as well not invest at all, you'll make more value by keeping the money for yourself.

Not how it works. Expectations about the very finite final quantity are baked into the current price. Bitcoin is a deflationary currency because by design it's meant to, all things being equal, increase in price relative to other goods, over time. 
It won't be a problem unless there is widespread adoption, but let's not pretend that bitcoin is inflationary or that deflation is good. 
@_date: 2011-07-04 13:14:58
Well, where does it come from?
@_date: 2013-12-07 11:41:08
This is pretty stupid. It's obvious that it's bitcoin whose value is unstable compared to other currencies. When you compare other "normal" currencies with each other, there's no 50% gain/loss within a single day. Only when you compare them with bitcoin does this happen. 
Edit: Wow, thanks for the downvotes; this sub is a complete circlejerk. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 15:07:11
That might be true but it has little to do with my criticism of the joke in the submission. Comparing the dollar with bitcoin and finding the dollar unstable is silly regardless of whether bitcoin might prove to be less unstable in the future.

I see. I thought it was one of those "they say bitcoin is crazy fake money but look at the dollar: the same criticisms that are brought against bitcoin you can bring them against the dollar too".

When bitcoin was discussed in during the peak of the recent boom, the comments were filled with people (who I assume came from here) who accused everyone that was sceptical of being jealous that they didn't buy bitcoins when the price was low. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:11:20
I thought the "joke" was that "if the world was fair, then the dollar would be questioned as much as the bitcoin". Which is why I wrote my comment. If the joke was intended to be about bitcoin's lack of stability, then I guess I misinterpreted the intention of the submission.
