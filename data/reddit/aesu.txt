So did gold until 1970, when it peaked, and has never recovered, adjusted for inflation. 
You're gambling on bitcoin never entering a 50 year bear market, like gold has been in for the last 50 years.
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:52:54
I do mean 1980. 1970 was the start of the bubble. Adjusted for inlfation that return is more like 500%. But if you bought in 1980 the return would be about -50%.

Coinbase is by far the most legitimate exchange, with multiple, large, serious institutional investors who would take fraud like misrepresenting user numbers extremely seriously. If you dont believe their figures then you're looking for a reason to not believe their figures.
Considering there are at least 5 other large exchanges with similar, or larger volumes to coinbase it is extraordinarily conservative to assume they have only 50% of the non overlappign userbase, combined. Giving 225 million active crypto investors. If we, again, very conservatively allow that they each only know one person they have bought crypto for, or talked about in detail, we have 450 million people very directly engaged in crypto. That's one in 10 adults. 
If you think one in ten people can be invested in or close to invested in crypto, without the other 9 at least knowing about it, you're selling a narrative. Sure, some rural farmers probably dont know about it, but everyone in developed society has heard about it.

No one is actually using bitcoin. 90% of coins are kepy on exchanges. It is being used as a speculativw tool to make money. The complexity and risk of ysing a wallet is too high for most people.
Coinbase has published its uswr numbers. It a matter of fact and rwcord. Likely less than 5% ever have or ever plan to take them off the exchange. They will never leave coinbase. In fact, as more early investors move to exchanges to cash out, its likely 95% of Bitcoin will never leave exchange wallets.

This is poor logic, since unless you'd desperately needed the money, if you evenly remotely believed in the concept, why wouldn't you lave even 10-20% in to see if it reaches even a fraction of it's potential(i.e where we are now)

I don't now anyone who isn't completely exposed to bitcoin. Coinbase has like 15 million user in the US alone. If you eliminate children, people in care, and people who are likely too old to be the core demographic, that's like 10% of all american adults. 
If 1 in 10 people have purchased bitcoin, it is far fetched to imagine most people aren't aware of it, probably in a fairly advanced, albeit second hand way. The average household has slightly more than 2 adults living in it, so 1 in 5 american households own bitcoin. 
At this rate, we'll soon be at the point where 50% of households own bitcoin. this is it. This is the steep part of the adoption cycle. We're almost at a trillion dollar crypto market cap, for gods sake. That's 1/7th of gold 1/3 .com boom, and 1/50th of total stock market capitalization. This is the beginning of the end of growth, without any question.

Not at all. His analysis is sound regardless of investigation performed. It is generally excellent advice to stay away from anything soaring orders of magntiude in value over the course of weeks.

You cant think of it that way. The jump from 40-80x was much more nerve wracking,a s we had to go from 100 billion to 200 billion cap. Each doubling is a bet in itself.

If it grows at the rate it's been growing for the last year, in 4 weeks we will hit $800 billion. In 8 we will be over 2 trillion, and in five we will be at the world gdp of 80 trillion. in roughly 10 weeks, the total market cap will be greater than all existing wealth. 
This absolutely cannot keep growing at this exponential rate. Where it stops is unclear, but it has to stop in the next few months.  If you think it's going to stop and just merrily go sideways so you can cash out, well... More power to you!

Adjusted for inflation, you'd be up about 20x in the DOW, and about 3x in gold. However, in the dow, you would have been in profit ever single year. In gold, you'd have spent 60% of that time at a loss, and most of it at break even.

The one attribute it doesn't have in common with gold, is the limited supply. No one can split gold and create a supply of gold cash, gold gold, gold diamond, gold sw2x, out of thin air.

Considering it started at 0, it would be an infinite amount. But the total change is not relevant on its own. the volume is more relevant. In 2012, the volume traded was very low. The total market value was equivalently low. So, if you wanted to invest more than a few million, you'd be in trouble, since it wouldn't have been available, and even if ti all were, youd soon own all the bitcoin in existence. Which would probably kill it, since the porject has relied on many people being invested.
So, although in percentage terms it has increased greatly, the amount of real money you could have made is limited, both because you could only have invested a relatively small amount in 2012 and because even moderate volume sells have crashed this market. If you wanted to take a few billion out today, you'd have had to have invested millions in 2012, potentially changing hisotry and stopping this growth from having happened, and also, you'd crash the price today to the low thousands. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:18:59

You can find almost any prediction for almost any asset, in retrospect. If we were at zero, you could find examples of that, and you could find examples of people predicting 100k+ if we were there. Same is true of the future.

No one is calling bitcoin fake. i dont know what that would even mean. It clearly exist. As for a scam, again, youd need to be specific about what aspect epople think is a scam. It may be used by some shady exchanges as a pump and dump scheme, or a lot of people might expect to simply get rich from it by selling it to someone else at a high price. Not sure if you can entirely call those scams, although the first is definitely illegal price manipulation. 
I've been in crypto for 5 years. I have never cared if it's a price manipualtion scheme, or the future of currency. i think theres a bit of truth to both. Either way, the price is going to go up, and youd be mental to short it. The people calling pyramid scheme would be the alst people to short it, since they're literally saying people will manipualte the price up.

Most people use an ISA account which invests the money into something else, for long term saving of small amounts. Larger amounts, pretty much everyone invests it into a long term vehicle.

Sounds very sensible. Everyone here seem to have forgotten or simply wasn't around for the last bubble where we shot up to 1200 in a couple of months, then crashed to 400  in a few days. Then we spent almost 3 years in a bear market, going as low as 10% of the peak. 
Any investment which loses 90% of its value at any point, is generally not a good one, since you have to be very strong willed to nto be tempted to sell in such a bear market. Also, it suggests very strongly there is no real underlying value and the assset is highly speculative.

I have n clue why or how it happens, but it has happened, now 5 times. it's undeniable, and very clear on the charts. Unfortunately I sold at 6k, since thats the growth previous bubbles had seen. Still made a nice chunk, but its been hard to watch.

Not with the intention of it growing in value. People understand fiat is inflationary, which is why they invest in other assets to grow wealth.

It's not about stupidity or complexity. it's about efficiency. If you have 500k in a cold storage wallet, it is always going to be proportionally more expensive to keep that secure than if it is part of a much larger haul secured by a bank.
You need to completely hide the fact that you have that much money in crypto. Since that's likely impossible, you need to secure it. And yourself. Since, anyone could potentially extort the private key out of you, with zero recourse on your part. 
The ability to reverse a bank transaction, and the ability of the bank to keep an eye on what's going on is actually hugely valuable. If you have your provate key stored somewhere, you need to secure it to a very high standard, in an extremely expensive safe, with sophisticated electronic security systems.
Since the cost of these systems doesnt' scale linearly with the amount of money stored, it will always cost a fraction of the cost of self storage to secure it in a bank.
And that's ignoring all the other huge advantages a bank can provide, like contactless payments, standing orders, credit, overdrafts, and more.
The real question is why people would use any given crypto, and not any other one, or more importantly, one which is guaranteed to hold its value, like USDT, or some equivalent state backed crypto, if they just want the benefits of crypto, and not a money making scheme.

Problem with this argument is that banks could easily bring down the costs to transfer money. It will always cost banks a lot less to actually transfer the money, than via the bitcoin network.  The blockchain is expensive and slow compared to what could be achieved between banks. And bitcoin would have to become a currency for that $100 transfer to be worth your time. After you've payed the 0.1% bitcoin fee and likely 0.5-1% on either end of the exchange, not to mention your time, and the risk of volatility.
@_date: 2014-05-14 15:36:41
It really doesn't. A public ledger will ALWAYS be more expensive than a private one. It costs paypal fractions of fractions of a cent to perform an internal transaction. They wouldn never use it as their back end. Yes, it could be cheaper to transfer to a users wallet than their bank account, but that's got more to do with the US banks monopoly. In the UK, and most of europe, bank transfers are free, so bitcoin would cost more, even there. 
Bitcoin is not a payment system. It is a currency. The majority of transactions should be off chain. The majority of users should use 'bitcoin banks'. The power of bitcoin is that power users CAN exist. You can keep your bitcoins under your bed, you can commit anonymous international transactions at low cost, you can manage your own security, etc. 90% of users don't want that. But more often than not, stubborn bitcoin purists dismiss the commercialisation of bitcoin through things like circle and bitpay as a dilution, or bastardisation of the 'true' bitcoin way. They fail to realise they need the average user with a circle account, who performs all their transactions off chain, for their coins to be worth anything. 
Bitcoin cannot sustain on speculation alone. It needs mass adoption. And the masses need simplicity and security. They will have it.

If bitcoin goes up in value, you owe a lot of berkshire shares, which almost definitely will have went up, or at least maintained their value.

at 100k the daily inflation will be 260 million dollars. Roughly every 4 years, that'll half. So 130 million in 2016, 65 in 2020, and so on. 
If you think 260 million dollars of inflation  a day is viable, then yes 100k is possible. It would also, btw, imply a total market cap of 1 trillion dollars, which is about 1/50th of the total world GDP. 
Possibly most importantly of all, due to diminishing marginal return, that 260 million dollar inflation rate is mostly spent on miner electricity costs. Which means we're expending almost twice the entire electricity consumption of california on bitcoin alone, when we have viable PoS coins... Something has to give.

Well, us dollar inflation is in the billions per day. So, if bitcoin achieved global reserve currency status, it could easily sustain 100k coin inflation. 
Also, the inflation rate, before 2016 would be 2600x100k which would be 260'000'000 a day, or 10'000'000 an hour, roughly. About $170'000 a minute.

Botcoin isn't about decentralisation anymore than cash is. It is a feature, and an important one at that. But it is neither essential or necessary for most users. Botcoin will remain niche if it doesn't grow on the back of centralised payment systems led ke coinbase bitpay and circle. Most people don't want the features of raw bitcoin, and they definitely don't want the risk and associated technical problems. I want and need those things, and many others do. But for bitcoin to be useful for its core features it requires a solid transactional base and strong economy which can only be facilitated by brining in the general up public

This is an example of the sort of fallacy that makes this community a laughing stock outside of this subreddit. You aren't comparing like for like. 
Bitcoin is a public ledger system. Banks and other payment networks like visa or paypal use private ledgers to track transactions. They also offer a whole load of things bitcoin doesn't, such as insurance, loans, consumer protection, and much more. It isn't the ledger that costs the extra money. It's all the other stuff. 
In fact, a private ledger is necessarily cheaper to run than bitcoin. The energy required under PoW will always make a public ledger more expensive, unless we change the proof system to a powerless alternative. Which may be possible. But until that happens, bitcoin is costing more, on a per transaction basis, than any private ledger system. 
You guys need to start applying some common snese and some respect for logical fallacies, if you want to be taken seriously as a community.

You still aren't making any coherent sense. Bitcoin is, fundamentally, a distributed public ledger. It's just a ledger, and we use mining to secure the authority of the ledger. Banks don't need to do that. Banks  and payment systems have internal ledgers that only they have control over. They don't need proof of work. They don't need miners. And I know you aren't technically literate, but they don't need any employees to do it manually. It is completely automated. Just like bitcoin. 
And if, for some insane reason, visa is employing people to manually update its ledgers, then they could easily switch to an automated method at almost no cost(the problem is very much solved; it's basic computer science). So, for its primary purpose as a record of transactions, bitcoin will always use far more resources than paypal, visa or your bank. Unless it switches to another mining protocol. However, due to a number of other inefficiencies associated with the protcols required for a public ledger, such a thing will surely always be more expensive, or atleast as expensive as a private one. 
Bitcoin has absolutely no advantage as a technology outside of securing a currency. It's not an efficient transaction system(99% of transactions will, and should occur off chain). Nor is it particularly easy to secure(most people will use a bitcoin bank of some sort).
The importance of bitcoin is that the blockchain is there. That it is cash when you need it to be. Just like real cash. Most of the time, youre happy to pay digitally, but you always have cash to fall back on. 
Bitcoin is not a competitor to the financial services industry. It's a competitor to traditional currencies. The technology doesn't do anythin better than the financial service industry. It secures a public ledger. That makes for a great base for a currency. But not much else. 
You're being spun a lie, in order to pump something which has value, but not as easily marketable a value as "it's better than existing financial services". And most of you are buying into it because you have no awareness of how traditional systems work, or really how bitcoin works.

Exactly, thinking about it as one big long play is moronic. It's a constant series of risk/reward. 
If you believe in crypto as religiously as someone who would theoretically hold to 1 million, then the risk, from your perspective is the same at $1 as it is at $500k. But the reward is 1000000x your money, vs 2x your money. The risk to reward calculation is constantly moving away from you, unless your belief in crypto is increasing by orders of magnitude every year. 
Not to mention, historically, assets dont add trillions of dollars in months. Even years is hard. It took gold almost a decade to move from 1 to 8 trillion. So, although 8x your money in a decade is great, that's a lot of time holding crypto, and potentially a lot of scares, and mor importantly, many other opportunities passing you by. 
@_date: 2019-06-28 16:14:21

You have absolutely no clue how many bitcoin millionares we have. 99% are not going to publicise it. Unless they have sold, and live in a country which publishes capital gain sources, then we dont know who has what. We do know there are a lot of bitcoin and ethereum billionares. 
Morfe importantly, i, and you, shouldnt have any interest in trying to double your money once we're in the tens of trillions fo dollars, since objectively, doubling it to 20 trillions of dollars is exponentially harder than any rises to date, which could have been perfomred by a handful of rich individuals. 
There will be a million better risk to reward investments  to put your money in than crypto, at that point. I wouldn't even care if it went into the higher trillions. The risk to reward relationship is terrible at that point, unless you're an institution or fund that is trying to grow huge sums of money.
@_date: 2018-06-23 17:02:11
if you currently have 100k in crypto, you need the total value of all crypto to reach 2 trillion, to make it to 1 million(7 figures) To make it to ten million, we'd need to hit 20 trillion dollars. That's more than gold, silver, the dollar, and the euro combined. 
Which is fine, if you think that's possible in 5 years. But given the present chaos, scams, and technological limitations to crypto, that seems extraordinarily optimistic. 
And that's all assuming you have 100k. 
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:02:49

I brought it up as part of a long comment, that was self contained and didnt contradict the other stuff you said.  You were the one who focused on the getting rich thing and implied it was still possible to get rich, 9 months from now, no less.

If 1 bitcoin is 1 million, its total market value would be 21 trillion dollars. thats 3x the value of gold.
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:34:42
Lets look at it logically. If you look at any chart, you can see the rate of growth is increasing in an exponential fashion. We went from 3k to 9k in less time than we went from 1k to 3k. If we extrapolate on that basis, we will go to 15k in the next couple of weeks, and then to 25k in less than two weeks. 
If you think well go beyond that, in order to maintain this pump, without going into a scary reversal, or somehow going sideways out of a completely vertical, and lets face it, speculative rise, we need to start gainaing roughly 100 billion dollars in value every week. Then 200, then 300. It gets a bit silly. At that rate, wed catch up with gold by march, and have all the worlds assets under our belts by december next year.
If you think that is possible, pour your life savings in. Otherwise be very cautious. Everyone here is trying to make money. When people are tying to make money things go down as fast as they go up. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:51:57
i dont think it matters. you can only double your money from 500k to 1 million. I can think of many better bets to double your money than gambling on bitcoin going from 10 trillion to 20 trillion. Even the 250k-1  million isnt worth it for me. I'll be more than happy at 100k.

Its effectively impossible since no one would buy at that valuation 
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:20:29
Bitcoin has a total value of around 260 billion dollars at 13300. Gold has a total valuation of 7 trillion. If bitcoin rocketed up, vertically, to half the value of gold, in the next 2 years, you would make around 15 times your money. Which means, in order to afford a $250k car, and absolutely nothing else, not even the insurance, fuel, or maintenance on it, which is usually 5-10% of the value, you would need to invest $18k dollars today.
To be rich enough to actually truly afford a supercar, i.e own a nice apartment/house in a good area, cover all yoru taxes, living costs, etc, and afford a supercar on top, you would need to invest a minimum of $100k today.
I seriously doubt even 0.01% of this sub has 100k lying around that they can gamble on bitcoin with. So, the only people in the second pictures scenario will be those who already have a very high income or wealth today.

@_date: 2017-11-27 21:49:42
There have been hundreds of opportunities to make hundreds of times your capital in the last 40 years. It's likely there will be hundreds more.
However, crypto is no longer an opportunity by those standards. We presently have a 300 million dollar market cap. Even by very optimistic estimates, such as crypto reaching twice the price of gold or more in a decade, you only stand to make 30-40 times your money. Obviously nothing to shirk at. but remeber the last couple of doublings of that wont be a huge opportunity. Thousands of stocks have doubled in a few years. It's not a huge opportunity once we're beyond 1 trillion, which looks soon. At that point, the growth potential is much less than many other speculative investments, yet the risk is still relatively high. 
The times of getting rich from crypto are over. Now are the times of maybe doubling your money a few times. no different than investing in goog, appl, msft, amzn, nvda, and so on...

How much an investment goes up is utterly irrelevant, if it can decrease equally as rapidly. The volatility of an investment is extremely important to people with real savings.

The long term risks are multifold. For casual investors, yearly volatility of bitcoin magnitude is definitely a risk. 
As for long term, you have already described crypto as a serious threat to existing finnacial systems. There is no way, none. Zero. Zilch, that america would allow cryptos to reach the valuations you suggest without shutting the down or resting control over them. They cannot possibly risk enriching unknown parties, who may now be worth more than any human ever, and have anti-american ideas.
Thats a huge risk. Dismiss it however you will. But if you think, for any reason, investing in an asset which threatens every nation state on earth, if it reaches your target prices, is a good idea, you're not a good investor. Maybe a good gambler.
But you're not even that, at this point. Since, even asssuming unbelievable returns, crypto total cap going to 5-10 trillion dollars in the next decade. Which would be extraordinary. I think we can both agree on that. It would really mean some huge political, social and economic breakthroughs have occured in a very short period, for crypto.
Even if we do assume that blue sky scenario, and you spread your bets perfectly across all crypto, you're looking at a best case return of 50x your money. 
Which is no better than if you found a startup trading at 10 million, and expected it might reach $500 million. Something thousands of startups who eventually went bust have achieved. Yet your risk, with crypto, is that governments see it as a threat and literally outlaw it. 
I can point to hundreds of investments with a 50x upside potential, which pose no threat to nation states. Crypto is no longer a good gamble. it's certainly not a good investment, since there are no fundamentals to invest in. It's a speculative asset. 
And speculative assets do not make for good investment vehicles, as golds decade long bear market, demonstrates.

this still doesn't explain how bitcoin could become more valuable than all the worlds currencies combined, in any reasonable time frame.
The major problems would be, if one of the people with hundreds of thousand of bitcoin today had complete faith, or enough wealth to never need to sell, they would become the wealthiest person on the planet, by an order of magnitude. Wealthier than any government, and their identity may not be known.
Even if that didnt happen, long before that point, bitcoin would become such a serious threat to major governments that they would attempt to shut it down, make it illegal and force people into state backed crypto.
The idea that you could make 133k out of 300 in 5 years is not reasonable.

What you're describing is closer to a pyramid scheme. A pyramid scheme is a sort of decentralized ponzi.
Bitcoin was never going to make a great currency. It's deflationary. It's not a good currency. However, it always was phonetically  good speculative asset. It has no balance sheet, no underlying value, no P/E or quarterly returns, so the price is free to move up and down on FUD and FOMO alone. Reality doesn't have to interfere. And when it does, it's just used as an excuse to see-saw the price(see last week)
Whether bitcoin , or crypto has underlying merit or not, it is presently being used as a wealth transfer system via pump and dump mechanisms.
Anyone who thinks differently is trying to perpetuate a fantasy, or actually lives in it.

I'm thinking about the average investor requiring stability in their finances. They cannot afford to be stuck in a several decade bear market, or lose to some unexpeceted regulation or fault that no one could foresee. If crypto crashed the 90% it did after the 2013 rally, and they had to wait more than 3 years to break even, a lot of ordinary investors may exit and lose money, or cannot afford that level of fluctuation in their net worth, for debt reasons, or otherwise. 
I think we're both generally in agreement. But crypto is not an investment. It is speculation. Which is fine. But thats what it is. You're not contributing to research, development, or asset growth in a  meaningful way when buying bitcoin.
You're gambling that someone will pay more down the road. It's not a bad gamble. It's not a great gamble, though. It's a fine gamble, but whether this is the final bubble or not, it is very likely crypto will hit a peak which wont be seen again for decades, and many crypto will fail. This reality, that at some point, a lot of investors will likely lose money, gives it a similar risk profile to option contracts on promising blue chips. 
All that being said, I have 25% of my net worth in crypto. But my net worth is very little, and has mostly come from crypto investments anyway. I wouldnt recommend anyone put more into crypto than they can truly afford to lose.

Not if you adjust it for market cap, it's not. Facebook, spotify, snapchat, basically all succesful startups, have beaten or matched any crypto, if you could egt in early. Google, apple, msft, have all beaten it by a significant margin.
What you mean, is that crypto is pssibly the best investment a consumer investor could actually get access to in the early stages.
But your argument is crazy in any event, since the pertinent point is that most people cannot afford the risk of losing their funds so rapidly, regardless of how good the investment is.

Gold has been in a 40 year bear market. If you're comparing bitcoin to gold, then you're reinforcing Dimons point, which is that, at some point, a lot of people will lose, like they did after the gold bubble.
Sure, maybe in 40 years, if they dont sell during the crash, they can break even. But breaking even in 40 years is a terrible investment. 
And land is not at all analagous, since people absolutely need land to live on. People do not need bitcoin. Even if it is a fundamentally oudn tech, which replaces currency, it wont be needed. People could transition to another crypto over time. People cannot buy alternative land.

I didn't I said for equivalent risk. Rember 50x upside is the very best case scenario, if everything goes unbelievably well for the next decade. Even you admit 2 trillion is a realistic estimate, which is a 16x increase. But it comes with a very high risk. 
There are many investments with 16x upside potential, with similar risk profiles. Especially on smaller amounts of capital. Your point about me being a billionare reveals how inevitable you think cryptos rise is. There are loads of mid caps, loads of small businesses, and assets which could increase by that much. The point is, most wont. Theres a huge chance crypto wont. Thats why I, and most people are not billionares, for one. But the real reason is, that me and most people cannot invest the 80 million you would need to become a billionare from a 16x return. Or even the 20 million you'd need on a 50x return.
I said decades long. it's been in a 40 year bear market. 
And your comment about the internet is surely supports my argument. I am not arguing crypto is irrelevant. Just like no one really argued the internet was irrelevant. I'm arguing that buying intot the dot com bubble was a bad idea for most people. Many lost because they didnt time the bottom, didnt spread their bets, and even if they did, the few companies who survived it have only reached their dot com peaks in the past few years.
If crypto follows the internet, 99% of cryptos will be worth nothing after a huge bubble, which takes decades for the handful which do survive to recover. Thats a terribel investment. Maybe a goo gamble, if you think the real buble is to come, and you time the top. Good investments have very low volatility, risk, and steady returns.

Absolutely, exactly right. But those things can be materially analysed and predicted with a fairly high degree of certainty. Again, same is true of world population. It is not true that it is easy to build up. building up costs far more than building at ground level. And, although there is no hortage of land in the absolute sense, not all land is equivalent. Building houses in the deep dessert, rainforest, or moutainsides is not economically useful. People want houses where the jobs and economic activity are, and that's in cities. The global population is being educated, and wealth is increasing faster than ever. There is no reasonable ground to expect demand for property, education, or jobs, and the resultant exonomic growth that demand drives, to drop anytime soon. 
You can perform a detailed analysis and come to the conlcusion that the risk is very low. That's why these markets are already bid very high, people are expecting big things.
There is no way of quantifying the relative size of the cypto market. It is not at all clear crypto will be seen as a store of value, as its creation is arbitrary. You can create an infinite amount of cryptocurrency, at essentially zero cost. That is not a good basis for a store of value. especially when we have good traditional stores of value, which cannot be printed at will, liek fiat cryptocurrency, such as rare elements. 
The salient point, is that people need jobs and property. So economic growth and property value have a limited expected downside. Any particular cryptocurrency is not needed by anyone. At any monment, it could be forked, and the talent move away from it, people become boed, or a cabal of ultra wealthy could short it while pumping their own, newly created crypto. And, blockchain technology, although useful, does not require fiat tokens like most cryptos, sometimes uselessly, implement, today. It is perfectly reasonable to imagine a world where all expensive cryptocurrencies are backed by physical assets.

This exactly plays into the hands of our detractors by making us look like irrational cultists who blindly extrapolate past returns.
To get those returns from here, bitcoin would have to be valued at 10x gold, or almost the entire dollar value of all currwncy in circulation.
Thats obviously moronic. For one cryptocurrency to be valued at almost the global gdp in any reasonable time frame is not possible.

The whole thing is  clearly being manipulated by completely unregulated exchanges.

Lets say bitcoin price goes sideways from here. No increase, or decrease, for the next year. Lets say it halfs next year, and goes sideways. thats 2 years at an average price of $3000
You put in 200 dollars a month. That's $2400 invested at $3000. 
In order to make hundreds of thousands, you would require the bitcoin price to increase by 100x. A value of $300000 per bitcoin. In order to make millions, each bitcoin would have to be valued at 3 million dollars. Given the 21 million in circulation, that values bitcoin at 63 trillion dollars. That's almost ten times the value of gold. Importantly, it's roughly the value of all currency in circulation.
Going back to your within a decade calculation... You expect the avlue of bitcoin alone, excluding all other crypto, to be as great as all other currency in circulation, and 6x greater than gold.
I remeber, 2 years ago, as crazy as this sub always has been, we were discussing 1 trillion as a heady valuation. Now people are treating 63 trillion like its an inevitability. 
Something has to give.

It serves multiple purposes. One of which is wealth creation, via multiple channels, which rwinforces thw dollars value.
Inflation exist tp encourage spending and encourage invrstment. Thwre are mant deflationary assets to invest in, and inflation is marginal enough that its silly to suggest the average person is harmed by it. Most are in debt, so spend every dollar they get before inflation becomes a problem. The rest twnd to purchase appreciating assets. This all stops people hoarding currency, and allows it to serve its purpose as a means of exchange.
Bitcoin is not even a suitable alternative, regardless of inflation, as it is seriously bottlenecled, expensive and complex to use.

this still doesn't explain how bitcoin could become more valuable than all the worlds currencies combined, in any reasonable time frame.
The major problems would be, if one of the people with hundreds of thousand of bitcoin today had complete faith, or enough wealth to never need to sell, they would become the wealthiest person on the planet, by an order of magnitude. Wealthier than any government, and their identity may not be known.
Even if that didnt happen, long before that point, bitcoin would become such a serious threat to major governments that they would attempt to shut it down, make it illegal and force people into state backed crypto.
The idea that you could make 133k out of 300 in 5 years is not reasonable.

You completely contradict yourself. You argue loss of value doesn't, in any way discourage savings, yet you point out someone who holds their saving in dollars would have lost 80% of their value, plus unrealized returns. 
You can't have it both ways. either the loss of value is a disincentive to save, or it isn't. You're essentially arguing someone with no financial sense, actually a complete moron, who is saving cash in a non-interest accruing account, will lose value.
That's not an argument, since such people will, necessarily, quickly be deprived of any wealth. Only the people saving via investment in interest bearing assets will survive, in the long run. Your argument directly supports the argument inflation is good for investment, and discourages currency hoarding. 
I absolutely agree the dollar will end up on a blockchain, but an unregulated blockchain will not replace a national currency unless it is so owned by state interests, it may as well be a state blockchain.

His point is not that bitcoin will not reach a high price, or even that it might stay much higher than it is now for decades. His point is that it's impossible to predict.

All shares are not expected to increase in value. Plenty companies will go bust. but it is reasonably expected that the global eocnomy will grow over time, and with it the companies that it constitutes. Since shares are are shares of ownership in that company, by owning a broad portfolio of companies, you can expect your wealth to grow as the economy does.
As for property, the world population, again, is reasonably expected to grow over the next hundred years, and since we're not making more land, property should also grow in value accordingly.
Cryptocurrency has no such rationalization. Hence this nonsense about it just going up infinitely. After all, there is a rational limit to the value of any one company, or the economy total. There are fixed environmental constraints which cannot be overcome. I suppose, in that sense, the value of crypto is potentially ifninite

Please take your money out. What you're doing is madness. I have met a lot of gamblers who have taken your attitude that they can kill themselves if it doesnt work out because they're already depressed. This is an unbelievably common attitude. It rarely ends well. Chances are you wont, you'll just be miserable and possibly turn to drugs.
But your equation makes no sense. Bitcoin has just rocketed up 25x in 2 years. It is valued at 100 billion dollars, whilst in the midst of hard forks, stuck transactions, mutliple regulatory risks, and a failed ETF. Sure, we might go to 25k in this run. But we might do exactly what we did after the last 2 bull runs, and drop 90% in a short period of time. And this time, maybe enough people get burned that it's outlawed in most countries. 
So your best case equation for the near term is 5x your money, worst case 10% of your money. 
Your financial goals are to have 5 million dollars, to live your life as you wish. That's $200k a year with the 4% rule, plus a 5 million dollar retirement blowout. If you cant be happy with that, you never will, so it's a good goal. 
Now you say you already have 1 million. 
Lets try a different investment strategy. 
lets put 500k into a mixture of historically strong market trackers, aimed at the sectors you like most. You may have to endure a market crash, like in 2008, but so long as you dont sell, the economy will always recover(failing armegedon, in which case this is all meaningless, anyway), so we can assume a 6 -10% yearly return on this, depending on risk, and a bit of luck.
lets take the other 500k and split it into 3 chunks of 166k
Put the first chunk into a local property you can manage. Use what should be a clear 6-8% income from rent, if you manage it, as your passive income. That's 10k+ a year income before you lift a finger. And the property will act as a savings account which should beat inflation.
lets take a 166k and put it into your passion. a business or idea you've always wanted to pursue which could pay off big time. Or maybe someone elses passion. you must have ideas for high risk/high reward local businesses that you could try your hand at. Aim for a high book value proposition, where you buy equipment or property which act as a store of the capital, rather than something which speculatively consumes your money.
the other 166k. put it into bitcoin. Hell, do some research, and hit a couple other cryptos if you want. look for high return. but put the bulk in bitcoin. 
Lets establish a time frame. Lets say 8 years. You'll be 43, still very young, and fit enough to live as you please. Also, as you admit, bitcoin might take 5 years to see the gains you wish, anyway. 
Now lets do the math. On your 500k, you're making, lets say 8% a year. That's not impossible on that quantity of money, with some diligence.  After 8 years of reinvesting the interest, that's almost $100000.
Your flat? Well, if you dont spend the income from rent, and assuming a historical value growth, it amounts to almost $350k
Your business? Well, who knows. Maybe it tanks, maybe you only make back your asset sales. But maybe it does a bitcoin. Maybe you get lucky. Lets say you do. lets say you make 3x your investment. Thats almost 500k
Now, the bitcoin. Well, lets assume you're right, and it goes up 10x from here. Thats $1.6 million.
All together now... You've turned your 1 million into $3.4 million. But, the important bit, you've exposed yourself to a fraction of the risk. 
In one scenario, yous stand to gain 9 million, but lose 900k. In the second, you stand to gain only 3.4 million, but you can only really lose 300k(bitcoin, and business venture) The other assets, although the may have ups and downs, have such intrinsic value, it would take an economic apocalypse to end them. You cant lose so long as you dont sell them. 
So, if your goal is to actually have 5 million one day, and live the life you want, the fastest way there is to follow the second plan. The fastest way to guarantee youll never have it, and be forced to actually deal with suicide, is to gamble on bitcoin. I say that as a believer in bitcoin. but it does have risks which could drive the price to zero. That's what makes it such a harsh gamble. 
You are just 8 years away from being worth 3.4 million, if bitcoin meets your expectations. With that 3.4 million, you could pull in an eternal income of over 100k, while beating inflation on your underlying. Compound that for just another 8 years and you would be vanishingly close to 5 million. And at no point did you risk ruination.

The risk can be quantified. it is subject to real world, rational constraints. 
But that's irrelvant. You have completely, utterly ignored the  flawed core of your argument, which was my counterargument. Hardforks can occur. The supply is not necessarily fixed. Second only to that, which is the crucial flaw in your argument, is that, if all this were true, why not back crypto with gold, anyway. That way, if the Apocalypse doesn't happen, you know you at least have some value in gold. And, if it does, the crypto will rise on whatever basis non-backed cryptos rise, as it would now be identical to those non-backed cryptos in every way except there is a non-zero chance you might also get some gold.

I started by describign the risk return principle. They are valued highly because the confidence value, which is all that exists in an investment, is very high. That is, the risk is perceived to be low. You have re-described this principle to me with more elaboration, but my original comment covers what you said.


The value of rare minerals does not come from their physicality, as you suggest. It comes from their rarity. And the risk of theft is almost zero, since almost 100% of trades in rare minerals occur via some form of derivative. the actual minerals are stored in very secure ways, which makes theft as close to impossible as it can get. The same is true already of crypto, int hat most of it is in exchange wallets, albeit they presently are more vulenrable to theft than gold vaults. But, it would always be true. No one in their right mind would store a private key in a way which was more vulnerable than an equivalent value of rare mineral. This is a complete non argument. In reality, you would want to store rare minerals and crypto keys with an equivalent level of security. 
crypto is no different from a physical derivative like a gold certificate. At least, in so far as it is used in its most practical application, to tokenise physical assets, in that ownership is no more ensured. In either case, ownership is possession of the physical certificate or the private key. That is what determines ownership. In that regard, a certificate which relates ownership to your identity, and therefore is not fungible and cannot be exchanged with impunity by a thief, is in fact a more certain form of ownership. 
You absolutely can print bitcoin. A hard fork could easily increase the supply of bitcoin. There is nothing immutable about the supply. It is simply likely to be enforced by the ore community. But there is absolutely no guarantee, as you dangerously and ignorantly suggest that the bitcoin core community could not hardfork into existence a chain with twice as many bitcoin. Bitcoin is just a name we give to the supposedly dominant chain. But no one has any more right to that name than anyone else in law, at least not yet, and plenty of bitcoin cahsers believe bitocin cash is and should be the real bitcoin, and will leave bitcoin core in history. And that's just the cryptos with fixed supplies. currencies liek ethereum have infinite supplies. In many, the tokens arent even that intrinsic to the functioning of the underlying blockchain, and many more are centralized, and many are not open source.

You can say the projects which survive will be a subset of the projects which work. but most which work will be replaced, or sabotaged, or simple fail due to any number of unknowns.

I haven't experienced anything less than buttery smooth 60fps, on anything I play, so it's not an issue. I even get 75 fps in each eye on my dk2 in Elite dangerous. Beautiful stuff. So, I have no plans to upgrade, at all. 
I'd upgrade to the q9550, because I can buy it for less than £40, I don't have to buy a new mboard and ram, and reinstall windows and all my programs from scratch. And it's more powerful than my e6600. It also benchmarks fine. Although, benchmarks are meaningless if you're never even using 50% of the available power, and half the programs you run don't utilise the features that it benchmarks well against.
@_date: 2015-11-29 01:44:28
And, yep, highest settings on almost everything. A couple of CPU intensive games, like skyrim, i have to turn down certain things, and deal with less than a perfect 60fps. But they're all still tremendously playable. Way better than even xbox one/ps4 quality, which only guarantee 1800p, 30fps. I play at 1440p.
All the games i enjoy playing run at 60fps+. I've been playing the rainbow six beta at ultra, and loving it. I'm running a gtx 980, and it takes all the workload. 
The only game I've ever had any real problem with was BF4, which occasionally dropped below 30fps, when things got very intense. SW: battlefront has been excellent, though. So, if i wanted to play a lot of BF4, I would have to upgrade. Probably just to a q9550, though. I've heard it eploits multiple cores very well.

I'm fairly sure it matters when a million a coin would value all bitcoin at 21 trillion dollars. Which would mean, if Buffet thought there was even a 0.01% chance of that happening, he would presently invest 1% of his wealth, and when it's worth 1 million a coin, he would be the richest man in the world, in all of history.

@_date: 2013-11-25 20:45:40
Yes. This is the problem. We have already reserved the right name for the wrong denomination. The bitcoin should be the fundamentally usable unit. 
We just need to refer to mBTC or uBTC as bitcoins, depending on which is most usable. The problem with this is that it could reveal the somewhat shaky and arbitrary nature of a currency that is infinitely divisible in such a fundamental way. 
Nevertheless, bitcoin will fail if we don't sort it out. I have a degree in physics, and the current system is still not easy. It has to be easy.

I have five. I doubt there are 7 million users. There are only about 200k on the bitcoin forums. only 70k on here. At this stage, it is moderately tech savvy people who are invested. They would be on forums, or reddit.
I'd say there are probably a million active users.
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:55:01
I'm not sure. Slip of the keyboard, misplaced though, ommision, really not sure... 
I was probably thinking, if they are worth anything as a payment system, its because they make payment easier. I think bitcoin is worth a hell of a lot as a sort of low fee, high utility, digital swiss bank account. 
It's not that I don't think bitcoin is a great means of exchange. What I think is irrelevant(which is why I worry about how heavily downvoted I get) Someone provide me a reason why a pragmatic, non techy person would use bitcoins over current payment systems. I'd love to have an aha moment. I think bitcoin will be worth much more if it is a payemnt system as well as a wealth store. 
But I haven't heard a use case that is superior to current systems. I hear the slightly cheaper thing, because of low fees. But those fees provide protection, that the average joe would much rather have than a few percent saving on purchases.
I really want to be convinced that bitcoin is a viable payment system with something to offer the masses. But no one ever expands on why. I just get heavily downvoted, which forces me to assume its more about selling a lie, than bitcoin actually having clear merit as a payment system, outside of niche markets. 
I own bitcoins. I believe bitcoin is a great asset store, and even if it is a ponzi scheme, has some ways to go. I would love if it also became a payment system-I just haven't been told convincingly why that would happen.
@_date: 2013-12-11 18:43:09
The later is more likely now. The rise until now could have and has been fuelled by consumer investors; mostly nerds; putting in a small amount of their earnings. Coupled with a few big players willing to take more risk on, it has soared to its current price. 
But moving from here is a whole different ballgame. Either we need big institutional investors to come onboard in droves, or we need a massive number of the working public to join in. Both cases are much less likely than the growth until now.

You might not like tax, but if businesses stopped paying en masse, society is going to be going through the sort of turmoil that would make the success of bitcoin irrelevant. It doesn't make sense to say bitcoin will succeed because people will break the law using it, and piss off a lot of powerful entities.

Bitcoin doesn't offer anything as a payment system, though. All its utility lies in it being a convenient way of moving and storing wealth. 
The average person couldn't give a donkeys bum about anonymity, or a 1-2% discount on most purchases, at the cost of no payment security. I don't want to use bitcoin as a currency, and no one who has access to a developed world currency will, either. 
I don't know why people get caught up in the use of bitcoin as a currency. All its features make it a great store of wealth, not a great means of exchange. It is worse than the alternatives, so no pragmatists will adopt it. And they don't need to, bitcoin could soar on large capital investment alone.
I know I'll get downvoted to hell. That worries me. This is all starting to feel like a mad ponzi scheme, desperate to get the public exposed to bitcoin so they buy in.

I haven't been convinced that it provides any use as a mainstream payment system, though. I am completely open to being convinced and would love it to grow into that area. But unfortunately most 'bitcoiners' input is of the form BITCOIN ISN'T A PONZI SCHEME YOU FUCKING FUCKTARD! Which, more than anything else, makes me wonder if it actually is a ponzi scheme.

If someone own 10% of the monetary supply, and sits on it for 10 years, they effectively increase the value of the active coins. If they try to introduce the 10%, they inflate the currency. If that happend too quickly, the price plummets.

As I see it, only the circlejerking retards on this reddit believe that they should use their own currency due to the belief that "the man" is keeping you down. Get a fucking job and stop playing with "money" that is worth less than monopoly money.

Secret agencies never try to delude their population or control the world...

Thanks for a sensible, coherent argument. I think you are right. But we are further away from that than we are from it being used by more people as a swiss bank account. 
I think the argument that bitcoin has to succeed as a payment system in order to be successful is back to front. It has to be successful in order to become a payment system.

Did you buy? I realised bitcoin was genius at $27. COuldn't get money into an exchange, and forgot about it as my exams loomed.

I just sold some pci riser for 10 times what i paid a week ago... They were snapped up.

It's not a ponzi scheme because it is a perfectly fine store of wealth even if it doesn't revolutionise payment.

The sort of people who use reddit have a tendency for wearing them.

To be fair, if it played out consistently, you could make an infinite amount of money.

I switched from the s4 to a moto G. The g isn't as impressive on the hardware front, but it certainly isn't $400+ less impressive. But more importantly, it is nice clean google android. Really nice to use, and I prefer the bulkiness and the psychological security that comes with only having 150 to lose, as apposed to 500.

I really don't see people problem with satoshi. I like it. Has the same cadence as dollar or pound, to me. Sounds like it could already be a currency. 
Nevertheless, I think bitcoin should become the fundamental unit. And what is now a bitcoin should be known as a satoshi. That really, really has to happen for the currency to become a success.

Why will anyone use bitcoin, if this is the case?

As is downvoting or attacking people who raise legitimate problems with bitcoin. Just banter, guys.

Why is no one addressing the fact that bitcoin is deflationary? There is no incentive to use it as a currency if it is increasing in value. It is a commodity. 
I know eveyrone has pointed that out. But why is it not addressed. Bitcoin could easily become a commodity like gold, with value as an anonymous, finite store of wealth. But how could it be used as a currency?
