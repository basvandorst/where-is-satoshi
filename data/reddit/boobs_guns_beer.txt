I do it for fun with money I can spare.  And it's like gambling. I started with 500bucks. 
And made a profit. And now only play with that profit money. Every time I make profit half goes back into savings. 
My buddy mines crypto, and makes 100-200 bucks a month. 
I view crypto as a volitial  stock market that poor people can actually buy into.

No no, lecture away, if I learn something new, all the better. 
Or if you have a better method for doing stuff. I like to learn. 
Financially security is a goal I set for myself 5 years ago. And I finally feel like I'm getting close to that.

I have a 401k match where I work so i put a % of my wages into that. To max out how much they match. 
I bought a house recently and make extra payments on principle, my truck is almost paid off  (less the 6 months of payments left) 
I have around an 8 months of emergency savings, to cover the cost of my bills if something bad would happen)  And I'm installing solar panels soon(to help offset the cost of a mining rig that I'm gonna set up next year depending of if that is still viable), I car pool to work, and have a roommate to cover bills and the extra money I put into the principle on my house. 
I save ~500$bucks a month depending on bills until I have a 12 month buffer again. 
Then I'll look into starting another hobby.  Stocks and bonds is the kind of hobby I would like though. I like doing stuff that can potentially give me a greater return then the money I sink into it.
Not going into college debt, and letting work pay for it, has been one of the best decisions I've ever  made.  And I have 3 years of "free" college whenever I decide to go for the rest of my life
