Probably not going to happen until the Chinese economy crashes.

Perhaps because the small blockers simply want to approach the problem systematically and methodically. Avoiding any long term consequences of acting prematurely. 
And the big blockers just want to block the layer-2 stuff as a bargaining chip.

I'm more inclined to believe it was because of hostile motivations than reckless impatience.

That would take any exchange down to ~$0 and not get close to filling the order. It may or may not bounce back up afterwards.

Likely means they know where they are and are reasonably sure they will stay put for the time being. Siezed assets aren't stolen, just frozen pending litigation. We don't even know why they were frozen, there are plenty of scenarios that don't directly implicate Bitfinex or Crypto Capital in any moral wrongdoing.
Probably someone trying to launder money through crypto resulted in one of Crypto Capital's bank accounts being frozen. Or the rumors of corruption in the Polish banking/government arena are true.
That's best case scenario of course. The alternative is that everyone is lying and Bitfinex is insolvent.
Take your pick.

What do you think inflation is? It's the government stealing the value of your money to pay its debts. And what worse is that they still have to pay interest on that money to the bank that printed it for them, which comes out of taxes. It's  a fraud scheme that eventually ends in hyperinflation when the state can no longer afford to make interest payments.
@_date: 2019-04-26 06:40:44
But they did... Enough to float a loan to Bitfinex... Even the money Bitfinex can't access isn't necessarily gone. They at least claim it will eventually be released back to them.

You realize that gdax is the only exchange at these high prices yes? Everyone else has already broken these supports by far. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 10:25:05
Not really, 4500 was a known support level, the next is 4k and 3600 after that. We'll see both.

Moons the other way buddy, guess you aren't making it this time.

I did some math based on total fiat in the world, 2 mil puts it at the same market cap as all the fiat in the world. This doesn't include physical assets or stocks though.

Bandwidth increase because the amount of data you must send to multiple other nodes increases. If you sync with a hundred other nodes in an hour, adding a megabyte to the block size means you have to now send a hundred more megabytes. It adds up quickly.
This is a problem because most people don't actually have unlimited bandwidth, even if it's marketed that way. ISPs tend to start downgrading service to high bandwidth users on residential lines, if they don't cut you off entirely and send nasty emails. This restricts nodes to business lines essentially.

You don't get that big without the backing of deep pockets. Especially when you are as stupid and nefarious as Jihan. These people aren't in the business of Bitcoin to make a buck, they are in it to control it. And once you control it, you can either milk it for astronomical amounts (inflation for example) or you kill it as a competitor to the systems already controlled by the people with deep pockets. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 05:53:35
The bandwidth costs, oh my.

By that logic anyone can post anything they want, including your ludicrous insistance that it's not being used.

It goes to the same value every time, and it affects all three coinbase currency graphs. I think it's a bug, the graph doesnt alway show it.
I'm more concerned that the coinbase graph and purchase price has breen frozen for 5 minutes and is much higher than their api reports.
Though I suppose the fact that the api reports the incorrect values occasionally too could screw up any automated trading bots.

You don't do that for nerd fun, you do it because Segwit, the soft fork version, kills your golden goose (asicboost) that has allowed you to monopolize the ASICS market. You do it because bigger blocks exponentially increases the bandwidth cost of running nodes, forcing the smaller players out of the market and again creating a monopolistic environment. The end goal is of course, achieved by baby step measures, to control sufficient percentage of the Bitcoin mining/node pool to force through whatever you want, thereby effectively gaining control of the future of Bitcoin. There are many people with very deep pockets that are justifiably afraid of Bitcoin becoming the defacto currency of the world. They fear this because they currently have complete control of fiat currencies, controls that are not possible with Bitcoin.

This, money you can afford to lose goes in the purse, money you want to keep goes in the shoe.

Which is why Brick and mortar use of Bitcoin is skyrocketing. Especially in Japan.

Ah the grand failing of democracy, the tyranny of the majority. I'm glad most governments abandoned that archaic structure centuries ago in favor more reasonable republics, with their protections of the minority.

There is a certain order to it still. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 13:40:28
Nothing is going to solve that on chain. Increasing the block size will just mean that it fills up with even more span transactions. The fees will always balance out to what people are willing to pay.

I'm not sure that's technically capitalism given the unfair market conditions that have been fostered in America vs China by politicians and trade agreements.

Yeah, the scaling debate is likely suppressing any growth atm and will continue to do so until segwit activates or whatever happens with the UASF happens.

Alts are likely to crash too, as casuals lose faith in the entire market. Crypto sinks or swims with Bitcoin.
These people are also not above playing the very long game. Ask yourself who is probably backing Jihan. There are probably some very deep pockets there who would rather burn a trillion dollars than see Bitcoin take over the world in 30 years.
In the long run, another crypto would probably rise from the ashes, but that could be a decade from now. And it would likely suffer similar attacks that Bitcoin is suffering now.
