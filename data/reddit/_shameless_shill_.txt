I agree. I actually have buys set as low as $11.

Yup. And don't forget that BTC-e probably got hacked or ran off with the money. Sell now buy lower.

Better wait and see what they actually recovered. May not be enough to pay everyone back and then you realize they are missing and everyones coin is *overvalued*!!!
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:17:08
Cash out now and buy back in lower.
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:15:58
Take whatever you were going to spend on mining and buy the upcoming dump. Could go as low as 1k. Then wait 6months and be rich.
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:54:29
Exactly. But still not great for the economy at large. More drops incoming, I bet.
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:14:25
But you can lose more in BTC thanyou could have in Eth at the time because there is more room below. If Eth dropped a few cents, who cares, but when BTC drops a few hundred bucks then you're going to realize the couple of bucks you get for a shitcoin wasn't worth it. If you want shitBTC then just buy it cheap when everyone dumps.

Sell now, buy back in cheaper. Nice bounce right now.
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:20:16
Just wait till the next dump. Will be even bigger.
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:33:17
Yeah, I don't think you understand how these exchanges work. *If* anyone else truly has the keys then they are probably stealing as much as they can right now and preparing to flee. If the govt has it, gonna be a long court case before that Bitcoin moves again. Look at the timeline for Silk Road and Mt Gox if you want a clue. But I truly don't think BTC-e will be back except to refund money once the govt seizes it.

I wouldn't want to mislead anyone on where to buy but I know that a lot of people (like myself) want out before the first. I have buys starting at $2300 and going down to $111 (just in case).
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:04:12
Probably better to sell it off and wait for the dust to settle. Can buy back in cheaper later.
@_date: 2017-07-26 03:58:36
Too much crazy in BTC right now. Best advice I have is to wait in cash and see what happens after the first. Plus there's way too much funny business going on with so many exchanges. Bitfinex, BTC-e, polo...
@_date: 2017-07-26 04:15:30
Before for sure, maybe again after.
@_date: 2017-07-26 03:56:46
That's just people selling. Biggest dip incoming...
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:18:29
Sell now, buy lower. Bigger panic incoming.
