interesting... have any of the NYC venture capitalists been involved in the discussion yet? This looks like a bad thing for innovation in NYC around digital currencies which, makes me sad. That said, thanks to Ben (1 internets for involving the community - I hope that it is true and the end result will be something much different than this draft.

advice on lump sum vs spreading out to multiple addresses? Spread out makes sense if you are securing them all separately. Having 7 addresses on one piece paper is just as easily compromised as one, right?

While not totally anonymous (although could be if are you serious as noted earlier) it's more about limiting the amount of personally identifiable information you have to send across the wire to do business that shouldn't require it.

Def hat tip for this @_date: 2014-07-11 12:22:57
while practically speaking - sure doesn't make much sense. But look around, people love bitcoin and are looking for new ways to express that love. This is a great example. Ask a gear head why he puts chrome clamps on fuel lines nobody will ever see, when cheaper versions would do the same job.
@_date: 2014-06-15 17:53:45
He's right. There actually is. 
@_date: 2014-07-29 13:33:57
I sent them the post. They laughed, never heard of bitcoin. I think it's blocks.

Just left the fair. Had a great time, made two transactions - both were pretty painful for the merchant. The bitpay QR codes most merchants are using are throwing off the new coinpocket iOS app for some reason. The no  bitpay codes worked like a charm, hopefully others didn't have to manually type in wallets like we did. 
Even with the issues, was very awesome to see and hear so many people talking about bitcoin and using it. Great work, next week will be smoother.

anybody else on here watching? what did you think of the derivatives talk? It definitely makes sense that with proper hedging techniques individuals and institutions will be more likely to hold/adopt. Also 1 internets for the live stream link @_date: 2016-01-08 13:20:48

Do you keep both USD AND BTC balances on coinbase or do you simply but when you need? I haven't found a good reason to keep cash balance if I'm carry BTC as well.
