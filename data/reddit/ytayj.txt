Oh please, you're not an adopter, you, like everyone else in this community, are in it for as long as it takes you to fuck off with a few million.
Which will never happen.
But it's amusing watching you lot get blue-balled about it.

If you'd actually read the post instead of rushing in to save your own hide, you'd have noticed that his point was that he tried repeatedly, and was blatantly ignored and fobbed off.

Hahaha good luck finding help on here. There's a huge, deliberate, collective ignorance going on in this sub. Can't admit to any serious flaws in bitcoin because that might make MY slice of the pie slightly less valuable.
You're all fucking animals.

Aaaand then comes another crash.

Because tipping people 4 cents while basically doing free advertising for changetip is equivalent to those annoying fake-$20-with-bullshit-religious-crap-on-the-back bills.
It's spammy and absolutely reeks of desperation.

I'm sure you're completely right and that isn't at all like every other outlandish (and wrong) prediction there's ever been about bitcoin.

I don't have a crystal ball but I certainly remember you desperate fucks insisting it would go back up when it fell to the 600s, then 5, 4 and then 3 where it sat for quite a while, until now. Your get rich quick scheme is fucked, and it terrifies you because you paid in way over the odds and now you're never going to break even. And your sad solution is to try and silence any doubt on an internet hugbox in the pathetic hope that it somehow saves the price.
It won't.
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:51:45
The irony is that as much as you pretend to gloat about it, people quitting now will lose less than you.

Except BFL were outed as a bunch of scammers and suckers still bought shit from them, even to the point of angrily defending them from the tyrannical FTC.
Your invisible hand doesn't work when it's attached to a retard.

Hint: It's not actually about terrorism.
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:45:55
In reality, the scammer simply pumps out enough propaganda/goodwill/"I'm sorry" messages to get people to fall for his shit again. And it works every time. This has happened in Bitcoin so many times it's ridiculous.
There's also the element of a scammer threatening or buying out criticism in order to silence it, which, again, has happened in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:39:15
Well, it does, because it punishes scammers and acts as a deterrent for future scammers. Some guy getting angry about x company online does not.
@_date: 2015-01-27 22:38:08
So you're suggesting that Reddit be turned into a passive-aggressive online begging service. Fantastic.

They seem to think if they run around with their fingers in their ears refusing to accept common sense nothing bad can possibly happen to the price.
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:47:29
So you're basically admitting you went on a random spamming campaign a la Indian call center scammers? Classy.

They're using Reddit as free advertising and you're doing it for them and making them money, all in the pathetic hope that you can recruit enough people into the scheme to break even.
You're the biggest suckers on Earth.
