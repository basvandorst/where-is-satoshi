I am in the same boat, still don't feel like it was a bad investment.

The SAR is anything over $2,000 can be reported.  That said an institution can do a SAR for any transaction they find to be suspicious.

So are they just going to pay higher fees or is this even possible with the limitations?

Do you happen to understand what open source is or are you just making assumptions based on the words?  I think you should look into it more.  Open source does not mean profit free, and does not mean people are working for free.

I am interested, but you being a US based VPN service is kind of a non starter for me.  You can chalk this loss of a sale up to the NSA.

Can't you only create 10K colored coins per bitcoin?  I read a technical article that says that after 10K the fee to process the information goes up, as you are putting "junk" on the blockchain.  Does any one know anything about this?

That is the way they want it, a cashless society so all transactions can be tied directly back to you. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 17:34:51
what?  Dell already accepts.  Why would you not want them to accept bitcoin?  Do you mean pray that a huge retailer dosen't announce they discontinuing their bitcoin payment acceptance?

Lets not forget that people spend billions to get their taxes done.  This money could be utilized more efficiently to produce things of value rather than navigate regulations.  
@_date: 2015-04-23 18:07:34
Totally agree.

I dont doubt you, but can you link me to something that says that eating it will give you cancer?  From everything I have read, admittedly not a lot, the way it effects you when you breath it in, would not lead me to believe you would have the same issue by eating it.  I tired to look to see if I could find anything about eating it, but have been unsuccessful.
Thanks!

I mean yes and no, that is to presuppose a couple of things, like a rational market and exact quantitative value transfer.  This does not happen in the real world.  If activity is all of a sudden transferred to bitcoin the likely effect would be an increase in the value of bitcoin measured at a higher rate than what was actually transferred, as speculators/savers/investors, would take it as a sign of a bump in the value.  This all said I still really only see a massive increase in the value of bitcoin coming from more transactions, regardless of the value of each transaction completed on the network.

Just because the USD is not denominated in gold does not mean that they don't hold gold as a store of value.   The US has the largest gold reserves in the world, something like 8,000 tones.  The gold is used as reserves, much like holding Forex.  So yes the fed does hold lots and lots of gold.

ehhh, I mean breathing Asbestos is bad, but I dont know if its that bad for you to eat it.  The reasons absestos is bad is because the particles it lets off when it is moved/disrupted.  The particles are small enough to breath but to large for your lungs to purge efficiently.  So what you wind up having is some crap in your lungs just chilling.  Eventually this crap starts to grow cancer, for a multitude of reasons.  If you were to eat it, I dont think it would have the same level of damage on your body, if any.  Just my two cents.  
@_date: 2015-04-23 12:28:25
Care to elaborate or are you just wildly speculating based on your own preferences?

Well your article seems to mostly confirm that its bad to eat, specifically this part. 
"If you swallow asbestos fibers (either those present in water or those that are
moved to your throat from your lungs), nearly all the fibers pass along your
intestines within a few days and are excreted in the feces.  A small number of
fibers become stuck in the cells that line your stomach or intestines, and a few
penetrate all the way through and get into the blood.  Some of these become
trapped in other tissues, and some are removed in the urine."
Well fuck me I guess I will need to find a new source for my daily fiber. :)

You should give it a re-listen.  As a kid I hated Zappa, I could not understand the music, let alone the lyrics.  As I have grown older both have made more and more sense to me, and now I find him to be one of the greatest musicians of all time.

Which companies are worth a trillion dollars?
@_date: 2015-04-23 14:23:38
I agree that it does not cover debt, and I agree with the $330B amount, I just did the math.  That is still a lot of holdings in gold.

I mean for me I am not sure if the economic output (GDP) of a currency necessarily determines its value.  I think what a lot of people are missing, is if people use bitcoin for remittance or for a reserve currency for international trade, you would not necessarily have companies denominating their earns/profits in bitcoin, even though they might use bitcoin to do some amount of their operations.  I think volume and velocity of transactions will matter more than value of companies which are dedicated to the network.  Will bitcoin be worth a million dollars a coin one day?  I have no idea, and to be honest I don't care.  Will bitcoin be worth $1000 or $10,000, probably which means its still a good buy.

Do you understand how economics works?  Cause it does not work that way.
