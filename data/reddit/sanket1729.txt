This is preciously what I meant by contract or agreement between business and miner. This could be a legal document stating "If this business sends me an invalid tx, they will pay some amount". The other part of the deal could a simple payment from miner to business. 


I don't think that is the bottleneck at all, verifying is simple, the problem might be receiving the data of previous block in the first place. Verification of signatures can be done in parallel and immediately at the arrival of tx. During creation of blocks, only double spend attempts have to be checked which is also not very hard. Miners already have verified signatures of Tx's when they receive it as a parallel process. So, only double spend attempts have to be checked here. Which you don't need to check since all the tx's assumed valid by default as per the contract/agreement. 
There could be double spend problems when you don't know what is in the previous block as you can't risk including it in the next block, but this is not a problem in this scenario since the tx's that are created are only broadcasted to you(Miner) . So, there is no chance that they were included in the previous block

I think got counts the commit counts for bitcoin core as BU forked from it. So, you can see the most BU code is just copied.

Do you even understand what does 95℅ even mean? There goes your controversial nature. Are you aware how many full nodes support segwit right now? (More than 50℅ for sure, I am not aware of the exact number). Segwit aware nodes are optional, the old txs are still accepted. That is the benefit of softforks, only miners to signal for it.
 I repeat, if miners follow the segwit rules, which they will since it is 95℅ will have signal for it. It will take a 51℅ attack for miners to reverse it. The miners can do that even today. All previous soft forks have been activated this way. 
My wallet will function with non-segwit transactions. It just works fine. You will be paying more fees for it. All wallets will support it because they will lose to segwit supporting wallets. There is no security vulnerability here, you are just losing economically. 
Your comment precisely shows the FUD and misinformation.

Yup, complete summary of all the reasons :) 
@_date: 2017-02-19 07:16:32
So many sources for mempool counter. I really don't know which is correct, but I guess most of them  deleted some old txs in mempool assuming that they would get lots of fresh new one with higher fees. But somehow it did not work that way. 
Keep in mind that these are full nodes which show less count are probably run by enthusiasts. I don't see a reason for full nodes used by miners to delete those txs. 
With all the scaling debate, I did not even consider the possibility that there is nothing to mine. I always assumed blocks to be full
@_date: 2017-02-19 14:53:09
I think you are misunderstanding my point, I want to say instead of mining an empty block, you can mine a block with txs with a trusted source which you know won't double spend. This is an advanced form of empty mining. I understand how header only mining works, I am suggesting something better here. You can also get fees with it. What would you prefer in the case the complete 1mb prev block is not delivered to you. A empty block or a block with txs?, Simple answer :) . This is the reason why would do it for less than market rate. 
I am pretty sure that tx validation does not go back all the way upto coin minting tx. It only checks whether the current tx input is a valid UTXO and signatures. There is no need to go all the back to coin minting. Infact, my pc, an average one, does block verification in under 0.5sec. Miners can surely do it in 10 mins(As I said, they don't have to wait for block to verify signatures which hey already have in mempool) . Verification is not process intensive at all. 
All your points are seem to be the similar points which I made in the post, maybe I should have written the post more clearly. I was suggesting this as an alternative to empty block mining. You obviously mine normally when you get the prev block, but until that time instead of mining the coinbase, you can mine these trusted txs.

@_date: 2017-02-19 15:11:50
How do miners know what is spam? Even if they knew, why would they not mine it as long it gives them fees? 
Whatever be the definition of spam, let us consider a scenario where all txs are legitimate and blocks are full. In the scenario where miners are to mine an empty block, do you agree that it is in benefit for miners to make blocks with trusted transaction (A tx published after the previous block was mined and by a trusted party who you know will not double spend)    instead of an empty block? I fear this becomes even worse when block reward decreases. 
@_date: 2017-02-10 17:55:57
I like the idea of a contruct such as mini-node but I think there will be a fundamental problem, why will I trust the work done by your mini-node? Full nodes does everything on its own, so there is no trust assumption here. 
I think there are ways in which you don't have to store the complete blockchain, but then again they come with trust assumptions.

They are clearly against core devs which is why they have forked the code. If you don't believe me, just logon to r/btc and see the pinned posts. 
Even without looking at the rbtc I can say that all the top 10 posts will have some comments about blockstream conspiracy. 
They are not against bitcoin, but they are against bitcoin proposals by core

Yeah, blockchain.info has unconfirmed Txs count since like forever. It's quite misleading when they use an unconfirmed tx from stone age to support thier claim. 
I only discuss things at rbtc which are not allowed in rbitcoin. There was no sanity to found, I was already aware :) . Even if scaling was bigger than what it is today , BU and or any contentious HF is surely not the way to go.

Pruning will be implemented in Bitcoin core 0.14. 
As of making transactions smaller, I am not aware of anything can done along those lines. Something like segwit where witness data can be discarded after verification comes to mind. But that is not reducing transaction size, but can make storing it efficient. 
@_date: 2017-02-27 11:54:06
Why did bitcoin choose the UTXO model for state representation  of bitcoin? It could have also used the accounts:balance system which is used in banks. Is there any particular reason for it not doing so?
@_date: 2017-02-10 16:47:43
That is my point in the post. I don't think the number is proportional to the number of hours/24. I think having a node 24/7 is has a significant disproportionate advantage than running it partially

If you look through my history you will see all my questions about SegWit adoption and why are people against it. Following is my compilation of reasons of why people at are against SegWit. 
*  People hate SegWit because it is developed by people they don't like. Every comment there is just a step away from another BlockStream conspiracy. 
*  Some people just want a HF, even without understanding the consequences. Partly, r/bitcoin is responsible for it. The moderation policy here makes them feel that they are denied discussion because their arguments are correct. So, anything which is not a HF cannot be solution (which happens to be SegWit).
* People are against the idea that SegWit is being advertised as a blocksize increase solution. They feel that blocksize must be an HF increase, and by SegWit adoption they will only delay the HF.

I think before asking these things it is, we should first ask whether we really need a blockchain / bitcoin for the specific purpose. I agree, high fees is a problem, but it is not that big of a problem for examples you gave. 
For IoT applications where you don't really care about decentralization, they can simply be managed by central servers of respective machines. If you want to use blockchain for IoT, you can simply open a payment channel between machines which talk to each other frequently and resolve the channel once it is done. IoT transactions, because of their numbers would have to be done offchain, no matter the on-chain capacity is. 
People having no bank accounts do not access to smart phones or smart apps either. As it stands today, you either need internet and smart phone(localbitocins) or an exchange(which require KYC and bank account). 
Fees are not good, I agree, but these solutions can still be supported. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 08:04:30
Miners don't even need to ddos to produce your scenario. Then can simply make blocks of 100kb which is allowed by current mining protocol. 
1 of the reason they don't do it because it will decrease the value of btc. Since your profit is in btc, if you game the system like you stated, it will decrease the value of btc in USD. This is not a very strong reason though. 
A more important reason is "Even though you are gaining more than what you would be before, you will be losing relative to other miners as they will make more profit (they have high fees full blocks and compensate the demand) and in the long run outlast you". 
All the above analysis is assuming that fees increases to the scale which you suggested in the question. I doubt that will be the case tough.

This a false indication to get BU activated. Then, once BU forks off, mine the core chain rendering BU useless.

That's because two way side chain does not exist yet. Only federated 2 way side chains exist (1 peg is federated and other is not). Which comes with a different set of trust assumptions.
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:28:48
Yup. I agree, the frequency of those posts need to reduce. 
We don't need to stoop to emotional arguments or other hate claims to show BU's problem. Things like conspiracy and picking lines out of context are best left to Having said that, I would still like the technical arguments to be presented.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:24:18
Actually that's 8 weeks in real life. And moreover, the difficulty cannot change suddenly, it can only change by a max of some factor. 
A more likely scenario is that, the core chain would be in such strong consensus after BU breakup, they will hard fork with difficulty adjusted.

This must be a FAQ. What if everyone starts pruning, where would new fresh nodes get the initial blocks? No business has incentive to keep blockchain history as they can just keep the pruned data for validation purposes. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 16:35:28
I meant network in the sense that "nodes that are connected to you" . My spv wallet can be cheated by full nodes. But if it connected to my full node, I am sure I am not being cheated. 
If the network gives me 1.1mb block, I reject it and a fork is created. There are consensus rules which every full node must follow. I assume that good full nodes will follow it. If 80℅ of nodes start accepting 1.1mb blocks, there will be a fork. But my node will stick to remaining 20℅ since they are in consensus with me. I will spend my coins on blockchain which follows my rules.
You don't trust the network, you just have to ban nodes which forward invalid blocks and verify the blocks. Magically, everyone will have concensus of blockchain. Without trust.
 Even if all nodes cheat tommorow, you can detect that with a full node( you probably can't do anything about it though). That's the power of a full node.
As for transaction acceptance, miner incentives take care of it.

Yes, the problem of mainchain scaling will always be there. Whenever we increase blocksize, regardless of the mechanism ( HF or SF), we sacrifice some aspects of Bitcoin. The question essentially boils down to how much as we willing to sacrifice?

 Are ASIC’s evil?
No, dedicated hardware brings us closer to the thermodynamic limit, and is therefore eventu-
ally a good thing for mining decentralization. Also, because ASIC’s produce more hashes for
the same amount of energy, they produce stronger proofs-of-work with proportionally less
environmental impact.
However, ASIC’s bring with them a risk of manufacturer centralization, such as what we
saw with Bitcoin in the early days of ASIC mining. Market forces eventually broke this
monopoly8
, and one thing which sped up the process is that Bitcoin uses the SHA2 hash-
ing algorithm, which was designed for easy development of dedicated hardware. Therefore,
relatively little startup capital is needed to develop Bitcoin ASIC’s.
Further, regardless of one’s personal feeling toward ASIC’s, they are inevitable. Dedicated
hardware will always be more efficient than general-purpose hardware (exactly because it is
closer to the thermodynamic limit) and Bitcoin’s incentives are aligned for ever-increasing

Simply put, running a full node means you are not being cheated by network/miners. As trustlessness is an important characteristic of bitcoin, it is of great importance that a user(not only businesses) be able to run a full node. 
I don't want to trust others with my bitcoins. In an spv setting, other full nodes might cheat me. Personally, I think, Bitcoin will not be special if it loses its trustless nature. What is Bitcoin different than bank if I have trust someone else?

Think from an exchange pov. Core Bitcoin has been proven to be stable. BU Altered the current consensus rules. They brought in a new product. As per the defination of Bitcoin, the longest chain should be btc. But it is not necessary that the longest chain holds most value.
 Exchanges and users want the most value chain which will be decided by the market. I think exchanges prefer to be more economical inclined than technically inclined.

Validation speed only matters if you are a miner. For a non-mining full node, you can validation speed is not relevant at all. There is Block hash validation, signature validation, double spend checks and some arthematic checks. 
Blocks come in 1 per 10 mins. So you download 1 MB and can perform the above operations on the downloaded data. Validation after downloading should take less than 1 second which is nothing compared to 10 mins.
If you are mining, than you need dedicated hardware(Asics) to mine. It is there validation speed matters because you want to start mining as soon as possible. Miners have good software and hardware to speed up validation since they can/should afford it. But normal users do not need it.

It was an accidental discovery. Maybe I should have phrased it as "without actively looking for it". Does that sound less sarcastic? 
@_date: 2017-03-05 03:35:25
Maybe we have different views of full nodes. Your views is full node as a wallet. I am viewing it as a medium for elimination of trust. 
Even if I have very little economic activity, it is in my rights to check that I am not being cheated without relying on anyone. I think we simply lose the fundamental characteristic of Bitcoin if a normal user cannot run a full node. Bitcoin will only be trustless to business and not to all users. 
Simple question, what is the difference between PayPal and Bitcoin? Trustlessness. You take it away, there is nothing. 
Repeating, you don't trust 80℅ of the network if it lies. They will soon fall off, because they did not obey the rules (invalid block etc). Their economic value will diminish because honest full nodes will report it. 
Just to give you an example, miners and small businesses decide to upgrade to a system where miners mine 50btc block reward and give the businesses ( the full node owners) discount in fees. Clearly, something is wrong. No-one is economically incentived to report this incident. 
My personal node can figure out what's going on. I will stay away from the network until it is resolved. 
Another point would be, it should be easy to setup a full node regardless of whether you actually run a node. No-one will cheat because it can verified easily. If the barrier to run a node increases, the businesses you trust with full nodes can cheat you.

In academic community, the existance of attack matters. It does not matter who caused it, if it can be done by someone, it can be done by everyone and must be prevented. You can't assume that well wisher will not attack. That's not cryptographic security. I can dare anyone in this world to steal my bitcoins. They can't. That's the cryptographic security which we need. They can't find my private key from my pub key hash. Just does not work.

The fee calculation is implemented differently by different wallets. Obivously, the higher fees you give the higher is the chance miner will mine your transaction in the next upcoming block. 
My best guess is "Mycelium wallet felt the 5BTC transaction is a huge one, and hence needed fast confirmations, so it decided to pay high fees" . You also can set the fees for your transaction, but most people usually allow the wallets to decide it for them. 
You are correct in saying the fees should only depend on transaction size in bytes and not the magnitude in BTC. If you have high transaction size(in BTC), you put higher fees to incentivize miners to process your transaction faster. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 16:22:46
It is possible, but such a thing would not happen instantly. It will be a gradual effect. As we observe the gradual increase in leading zeros towards 256( current algorithm is sha256). We will simply change the crypto algorithm. 
In reality, the fact that you can realibly produce  high number of leading zeros means that SHA 256 is no longer a good algorithm. We need more bits , maybe 1024.

I live in Korea. The biggest exchange here is yet to accept BCH. I would double check this info, but to the best of my knowledge this is not true
@_date: 2017-01-03 16:32:12
Do you mean I should invest,   say 100$, every month. If I have 1200$ now, why should I invest 100$ every month than 1200$ in 1 go?  Do the fluctuations really matter if the total amount being invested is the same?
@_date: 2017-01-09 12:15:53
Agreed, 51% is easily detectable and the economic majority simply forks away from the attack. 
Still it does not break mining, it can only help in double spending. You can only still create 12.5 coins per block. The question asked if bitcoins can be created out of thin air, which I think is not possible without crypto-break.

When will you give up, scammer?
@_date: 2016-12-18 06:01:40
100 percent scam
No KYC.
Minimum limit 0.5 BTC.
No name of owner on website. 
Payment option in USD as the first option despite being indian company.
I would like to know what we can do as individuals against such sort of scams

Lots of leaning about technical aspects. And some new friends :)

Roughly, the difficulty *d* is inversely related to the target hash value you are trying to achieve. That is when you are trying to k where *h(hash|nonce) &lt;=k*. *d* is inversely proportional to *k*

I actually downloaded Bitcoin core and setup a full node last month. As per my observation, the data downloaded upto 2014 was about 20% of total data compared to the total data now. Which indicates that blocks were not full by that time. It took more time to download the later stages of blockchain as the blocks are being more and more filled. It took about 8 hours to get the complete thing downloaded and verified at a 500mbps connection.

Storing coins on personal wallets is recommended as you do not have to trust anyone with your money. That being said it is also risky if you lose your mobile wallet without backing it up. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 07:04:37
I don't see that as good news because it shows that the person who showed interest in 2010 is unsure about 2017. That's all bad news. As far lost coins are concerned, they are same as coins not in use. If someone loses bitcoins , it increases the value of other bitcoins. Having new supply only decreases the value.

The reason it's called Miniscript is because it is a subset of Bitcoin script. So, naturally the expressive power of Miniscript is less than Bitcoin script. 
Miniscript is able to express all possible conjunctions/disjunctions/thresholds of timelocks/hashlocks/ and (pay2)public keys. 
Turns out almost uses cases for script are covered by it. However, somethings like Peter Todd's hash collision bounty puzzles can't be expressed in Miniscript.

What do you think of a combination of PoS of PoW? Say, having 4 PoS blocks in between 2 PoW blocks. That solves the standard nothing at stake argument. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 02:10:55
Yeah, sure. Atleast, let us agree that need to stop this asicboost? 
@_date: 2017-04-07 02:06:09
That's not my question. But asicboost exists, jihan even deleted his tweets(which he claimed asicboost did not exist) and then says we have it, but don't use it. Do you trust him?

What parts are having cash shortage now? I think you go it upside down. There was a problem, but it's almost gone now. 
@_date: 2017-04-15 08:04:27
Is the problem resolved?
@_date: 2017-04-17 06:24:22
The first 4 withdrawals in a month are free of cost for other ATMs. After that there is a charge. So, I don't think it matters that much since most people don't use ATMs of other banks that frequently. 
I understand that it is a cash shortage is a problem in some parts of India. But in most parts including the part where I reside, it is not a problem. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 02:09:07
Thanks, edited for more clarity. I really intend to educate crowd.

As someone else pointed out, we have bigger things to worry about than BTC if quantum computing breaks!
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:27:42
Nice. Pondering more over it, upgrading to 0.15 directly means no2x. Because it is the first core update after btc1 release. 0.14 users have a choice btc1 or 0.15. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:22:47
Is 0.15 out, I mean release. Not rc

I have heard that Barry is one of the major investor in Korbit. So, I doubt that it will be of any help.

If your wife is not using it as wallet, it is not helping much. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:57:37
Yup, this is by definition a Hard Fork. But, I personally will count it as 1 if was in release version code. Was there any release version of btc1 which had the opt-in replay protection? Has there been a release version after the replay protection was removed?
@_date: 2017-05-22 00:32:29
So, do we expect an official binary release of this? Or will it be 0.15? 
Say this PR goes through, to use this immediately  will I have to download and compile the source myself? 
@_date: 2017-05-12 03:10:18
Can you please elaborate technically? Even a link to such source is appreciated. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 11:22:03
Well, ideally we want every Bitcoin to be the same.( fungibility)

I can give you names of many core devs who are not funded by blockstream. Can you point me one contradiction in the above claim?
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:00:07
Agreed, if we are going to do a HF, let's do it properly. For example, we can make all blocksize increase in future as SF. Let's reopen the HF wishlist

There is nothing wrong in asicboost. The problem was that a protocol update (namely segwit) was probably being blocked because it not support asicboost. That's it. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 16:47:44
Did you mine that block?
@_date: 2017-07-14 12:54:49
Here are some high profile names which contribute to bitcoin core who do not work for blockstream. Wladimir J. van der Laan, Jonas Schnelli, Alex Morcos, Erik Lombrozo. And about 1 hundred more who do not work for Blockstream. This contradicts your statement which claims 100% blockstream devs contribute to bitcoin core project. 
 I am still waiting for a single contradiction for nullc's statement. Bitcoin Core project does not bend to big money/ centralized players for their needs, on the other hand implementations like ABC follow Bitmain hand in hand, their entire plan for HF is directed by Bitmain(they even admit to it).

That was a problem. But when they sell s9 at , hashes per second. And antminer gives that. Whatever antpool uses for itself is thier own business. The bad point was everyone was wondering was miners are blocking segwit, and we see there was a hidden excuse.
