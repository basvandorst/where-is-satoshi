I took my initial investment out. Just so that I could play with the rest guilt-free. I might throw my initial investment back in tho so idk. Gotta spend money to make money but at the same time if you get too greedy you could lose it all. I like the idea of having my investment back but at the same time the second I put it in I knew I would be ok losing it

Where in my post did I say I was smart? I am perfectly aware this is essentially gambling and I am playing with fire, which is why I cashed out my initial investment. I do believe in bitcoin and will stay in it long term in some capacity.  I am really just having fun at this point. I’m not playing with my life savings here...

Not OP, but it took a week and I got them at the price on that date that I bought them

Everyone is asking this same exact question. That’s how long it takes to move money from your bank to coinbase!

If everyone loses faith in it and pulls their money out

Right now I am using Coinbase and Gdax which only allows me to invest in 3 coins. Where should I go if I want to buy IOTA? (I live in the US)

I am a Noob here who bought in at 9k and sold at 17.7k. Currently watching for the dip and hopefully can catch a wave after. I already cashed out my initial investment and put it back in my bank account so I didn’t “lose” anything. I have no understanding of market mechanics or crypto beyond 1 week of reading this sub. Glad I jumped on this rollercoaster!!

Why not? Look at the growth over the last few weeks.. it makes no sense. Nobody can predict exactly what it will do
