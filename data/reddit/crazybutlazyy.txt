What do you mean by private? As in terms of anonymity? Is that something you value with btc over cash etc.?

I have heard of him before, he's kind of a celebrity here isn't he? I think he has written a book too 
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:21:42
I meant that as a portion of what you put aside for investing, not total wealth. Of what you invest/save, how much would you say is in BTC? 
@_date: 2018-01-26 00:43:20
Interesting, I have never seen anything like that before. Does bit pay act as a bank or just as a means of taking your transactions? 
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:23:36
Absolutely true. Right now I'm thinking about how willing someone would be to use bitcoin as their only currency. This may be a real use of bitcoin as popularity increases and scalability issues are resolved. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:23:09
Most people are interested in the investment potential. Meanwhile there are actual issues w actually using the currency right now. My interest is in how people who actually use btc react to problems with bitcoin. How can the be alleviated, and how do those solutions impact the future of btc 
@_date: 2018-01-26 03:03:28
I find that interesting. I would guess that this circumvents the bitcoin network almost entirely for smaller transactions then. Saving real transactions for whenever you send btc to bit pay. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:27:34
That sound pretty interesting, can you provide a link to any info about it? Either here or through direct message? 
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:51:03
If u may ask, how often do you make purchases w bitcoin? Do you find it hard to find a vendor that accepts btc? 
@_date: 2018-01-26 05:06:36
That's super legitimate, bit pay seems to be the result of the lackluster adoption by mainstream companies. I like the model. Do you know of anything else like bit pay that exists? Anything that deals with bitcoin transactions 
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:51:54
Certainly, a lot of people are interested in investing in BTC. Potentially more so than actually using it for what it was intended to be. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:46:20
Would you say that you were interested in bitcoin more for potential profit or to try to actually use it for purchases? 
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:06:20
So crypto makes up a significant portion of your investment portfolio? Would you be saving/investing if it weren't in bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-02-23 14:10:53
Oh my goodness r/bitcoin! I just woke up to this amazing response! I was amazed with what had happened in just a few hours last night, but while I slept you guys put in 6x the responses that I had before I fell asleep. I am incredibly humbled and excited about this. I'll be giving updates during the school day, as I have early classes today, please stay tuned everyone! 
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:51:51
Thank you so much, please feel free to share this survey with anyone that you know is interested in Bitcoin or crypto in general!!
@_date: 2018-02-23 06:20:50
We can talk about this in greater detail tomorrow, because I have to go to sleep. send me a pm and I'll get back to you about what I am doing  
@_date: 2018-02-23 06:16:11
I'll be finishing this project withing the next few months, we'll see about a followup around then! Thank you for your time 
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:56:08
Not necessary, haha! I am very happy about the response I already have gotten! You are all amazing!
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:56:11
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:44:13
Thank you very much, I had a hiccup with the form, If you can please retry the form it should work better.
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:23:51
Everyone in this subreddit can help out! Please fill out a response if you can. I am looking for anyone and everyone possible!! This survey should only take a few minutes. Thank you all so much in advance!!! 
@_date: 2018-02-23 06:14:54
Thanks, i am getting great responses and the activity is way beyond what I ever could have imagined! 
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:08:13
I appreciate your time! Thank you.
@_date: 2018-02-23 17:29:00
It's amazing looking at all the hard work being done on its own! I have so many pie charts and graphs. It's beautiful 
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:55:07
Please try the survey again, there is no longer an email requirement 
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:41:06
Yes that is very valid, I have removed the requirement for adding email addresses. Thank you for the response
@_date: 2018-02-23 06:17:08
Everything I have seen so far has been useful! I am very excited about this project, I might share my findings when I am finished up 
@_date: 2018-02-23 06:21:48
I'm writing a paper using the information from this survey, if there is enough demand I'll submit it right here on the bitcoin sub when I'm done. This project should be done within the next few months 
@_date: 2018-02-23 17:29:59
Is a public high school student considered a government contractor? If so,  I guess I'm the fed! 
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:34:45
This survey shouldn't take much of your time, but it will help me so much for my Senior research project! I appreciate everyone that takes the time to respond. If you have any questions you can leave them here or send me a message here on reddit!
@_date: 2018-02-24 05:07:19
The survey has been disabled, thank you everyone for participating! We reached a total of 810 responses and I look forward to sharing what I would with all of you 
@_date: 2018-02-23 16:13:39
Over 700 and counting! I am absolutely astounded by the community response here! 
@_date: 2018-04-03 04:13:59
Sorry for the late reply. At this moment Segwit adoption is not at a majority percentage. The purpose of my research is to find whether there is community consensus with respect to these popular solutions. I should have directly acknowledged in my post that Lightning and Segwit are reliant on each other. I apologize for showing my ignorance. 
My overall goal is to understand if the community is willing to advocate, or support a solution that is intended to solve long or short term scalability issues. We saw a problem when transaction fees were peaking around 40 dollars, would it not be reasonable that a development supported by the majority of this community could prevent such an event from happening in the future?
This paper focuses on Bitcoin communities because they are a particularly interesting starting point for change, as many people here do discuss bitcoin on here and in real life. I felt that this subreddit is a significant starting point for any new developments, which is why I chose to survey this community. 
I have only recently heard about schnorr, and in a previous survey, that had 810 responses, had a section where people were able to fill in any software developments that they felt addressed the issues with Bitcoin (with respect to the transaction issue). Schnorr was mentioned less than twice, leading me to consider it less relevant in this community. I apologize if I missed out on this 
What is really significant here is that i saw that there was a majority population supporting both lightning and segwit, meaning that these two will be likely to actually be implemented widescale, due to the ability of this community to advocate for change.
