Thanks for the quick advice. My wallets are empty, but I will probably wait for a rate of 150$/BTC and invest one third of my savings. What do you guys think?
P.S. I really appreciate any help and support whether it's an advice or your personal experience - let me hear it. I fell like soaking up some intel!!!

Thanks man!!!!!! Oh my gosh!!!

That's tough, dude! Everyone should have the right to pursuit their own happiness, so I guess I'll just do my best!
P.S. It's not much, but I guess it's better than nothing. 100 bits to symbolically help you with your rent. You need them more.

Sounds logical. Do you think I'll be able to mine 1 BTC a month with a RaspbPi and one of those 300 MH/s sticks?

Won't do - thanks :)

I know, but still it shows that there's people who are sort of nice. I mean, why would someone give 3 cents to a stranger on the internet? You know what I mean? I just appreciate the generosity itself and a wallet with 3 cents is better than one that's empty, right? ;)

Yah I'm constantly being told not to - I guess I'll just listen

What? gosh thank you!!!! 😃 I love reddit.

You're absolutely correct.
I just think both versions should be fine. 
The equivalent of this conflict in Russian is the disagreement on whether it's "going/being ON Ukraine" in Russian (на Украину/Украине) or "...to/in Ukraine" (в Украину/Украине)
@_date: 2015-07-27 17:33:59
I'm pretty sure it's "the" Ukraine. (Was born there, should know...)

Some fancy Kiev hipster waiting for his Starbucks Visa to finally upload a picture of a cup to Instagram changed a Wikipedia entry. So what? That's just some newfangled nonsense. Ask 100 Ukrainians from different parts of the Ukraine - then you'll have an answer.
Why can't just both be fine? I think it's the same reason Russian can't be a second official language - "because SOMEONE said so"
Nothing's wrong with dropping the "the", but why does it have to be wrong not to?

Alright - go ahead, I can handle the down votes. Is that your idea of freedom and democracy? It's been "the" Ukraine for decades, centuries. Most people there don't even care about Europe or NATO. That's a minority movement. I just came back from Kiev a few days ago. You guys want to join NATO - whatever. EU - never! Fix your roads, change your mentality and get some proper politicians because the people you have now are just as bad as the ones you've scared away. Instead of a corrupt pro-Russian government, you now have a corrupt and uneducated pro-American government. I call them "uneducated" because they don't even speak proper Russian or Ukrainian. But they're Russian is still lot better because that's the language they speak on a daily basis. They only speak Ukrainian to the media.
Now we're like the fat kid that no one likes so we just want to fit in and be like the others so "please drop the "the""
Wake up we have bigger issues to fix. All I hear is "it's all Russia's fault"
Veterans are starving because their pensions have been lowered. And our currency was a joke which was supported by Russia. Now we have nothing.
Stop making up issues and start fixing the real ones.
Look at Turkey - they're light years ahead of us and still not in the EU. We're not even going to get Visa-free Schengen travel before 2030.
You call yourselves patriots? If they gave you EU passports you would be gone. You'd be patriotic in France, Germany and the UK!
Ukraine is a great country, it's my country and some Nazi bastards are demolishing it in front of my eyes! I don't want to be associated with those people. Ukraine is a country where the absolute majority of people know Russian and most people also speak it. Where people know their roots and are proud of them. I'm not against the Ukrainian language - it's actually quite beautiful. What I don't understand is this hate against Russia and the Russian language. We're brothers!

This is some personal second-level domain DIY website. And it's obviously pro-Ukrainian.
Doesn't look trustworthy to me.
Definitely not a legit source.
@_date: 2015-07-28 15:14:08
So it's about being like everyone else? Instead of being proud of our uniqueness we became the fat kid that no one likes and we just want to fit in and be like the others?
It's the United States of America btw., but that's beside the point.
