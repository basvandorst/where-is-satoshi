The btc overlay only goes back 10 months though.

I love how they let you deposit coins into your account, but you can't withdraw them until you're verified. I've been waiting three months for verification, still not verified, apparently its been esctalted to the AML team (6 weeks ago), but they haven't even responded to an email since that happened. Im completely at a loss with what to do.

At least 13! But those arw unfortunately mine :(

I for one have lost (?) my gox coins, and im waiting to be verified on another exchange so i can possibly (in the next week, when the price may stabilize) buy back in.
I lost all of my btc on gox, don't get me wrong. But i believe in BTC, and like a lot of others who lost them all on gox, i only had in btc what i was willing to lose.

I was in a similar situation to you mate, i put my coins into my mtgox account before i was verified, as verification wasn't apparently requried to withdraw. Turns out that isn't the case anymore.
Honestly, i'd still be waiting on my support request to be verified, if it wasn't for  on freenode.irc.net (i believe those are the details). Join that channel, quote your support case (if you have one), and they should be able to put the wheels in motion... SarahCoinBit (i think thats her handle) helped me get verified about a fortnight ago (the week after the 'no withrdawing btc' was enforced, unforunately).

About 10 weeks, which included the time i was rejected and not told, and also having the support request open but no one responding. I honestly believe i would still be waiting and unsure of why I was rejected if it wasn't for that irc channel

I have had coins sent to a wallet that is stored on mtgox, and i can't send the coins to another wallet until I get verified. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 10:37:44
I just bought in after losing all 13 of my coins on gox. Buying in at 10x what i paid for in April 2013 is soul destroying, but i truly believe in bitcoin. 
I also now believe in cold storage.

I don't think ill be clicking on that link...

I can confirm (for what its worth) that she is a mod at mtgox - she helped me FINALLY get verified about a fortnight ago. I quoted her my support case, and she was able to update it for me and sort out my verification.

I lost 13 BTC and i can't stop thinking about them, but i intend on buying back in as soon as i'm verified... despite the fact what i buy with now will give me 10% of what it did in April 2013.

Hopefully its protection from the US government too!

Hahaha yeah, like he did to Lau (?) in The Dark Knight
@_date: 2014-02-14 15:33:18
Can you please explain what you mean? 
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:01:39
Because mtgox has hubdreds of thousands verified AML accounts i think. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 10:21:11
Theres still hope!

I bought in at $73 and lost all my coins on gox. This title makes me feel hollow inside. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:33:17
add another 13 to that.
@_date: 2014-02-10 10:14:25
So long as they can 'fix' it and we can all get our bitcoins out of Gox, i don't care what their reasoning is.
@_date: 2014-02-26 10:38:44
I only had thirteen coins. They had been in GOX since November, when i placed them there thinking that  i had finally been verified. I wasn't, and it took me untiil AFTER the btc trading freeze to be finally verified. 
I didn't once try daytrade, and i was quite proud of that. Which is ironic, because if i had have, i would have noticed sooner that i wasn't verified, and maybe would have been verified sooner.
@_date: 2014-02-20 14:22:28
A friend bought them for me and placed them there in November. My verification request was denied (they never said why or even told me), and they only responded to my support request when i discovered  Unfortunately i discovered it two days before they stopped btc transactions.
For what its worth, i finally got verified last week. How cruel. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:32:24
Since mid December, when i tried moving them to a paper wallet and it wouldn't let me - it said i was still unverified. I got verified AFTER the btc transactions stopped. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 09:54:43
What a stupid analogy.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:18:34
Thirteen btc that i bought in April :(
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:27:09
Shit sorry man i just reported you isntead of replying too you...
I was going to say teh same, ive been waiting since November for my verification, and i had 13 coins in there i couldn't get back out.
