Pardon you sir, I believe you just meme'd

Bah, think that's a worry? Try shorting Bitcoin.

TLDR: Buy litecoin? xD

How convenient.

I wonder how much they get paid to click the arrows? 2 cents of bch? Obvs menial workers cos the ol grey matter is not with these guys and their comments.

Hijacking Bitcoin by vast corporate control? An army of trolls ready to downvote comments? And upvote poor insulting comments, about this sub and its users apparently. Look at the amount of upvotes that some are getting, so quickly, its odd and manipulative. At least those downvoting this app are not being paid to do it and do it from caring about a coin they hodl'd, cared for and support.

Maybe you don't get the nuance being new. But this is a highly controversial issue.

They haven't stopped.

I think that article talks about the issues, did you read it or kneejerk comment?
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:05:08
So did Satoshi? Coincidence?
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:08:50
Haha! It does, the facts speak for themselves.

Did you see the graphic? The screenshot from the appstore? Which reads "- Defaults to BCH Wallet"? It's plain to see. The only folks making a big deal here are the deniers, who appear to deny what is plainly in front of them. At least another commentator here admitted it was a "copy error" that has since been corrected.

I think you really need to read up on what you appear to have prematurely judged. Bitcoin is a rather large industry, perhaps research a bit more before coming to a prejudiced conclusion. A lot of intelligent people recognised why Bitcoin is good, perhaps they may know why?

Good catch!
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:27:00
Well said.

The app is controversial, it uses the Bitcoin name and yet defaults to BCH. No thinking needed, you obviously didn't before making that insane (war? really?) sounding post.
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:29:29
You don't think that is, at best, confusing? Intrusive? Misleading? It's a despicable misuse of the Bitcoin brand in my opinion, but as you say, I am sure others can reach their own conclusions.
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:55:49
The article cites how it defaults to BCH, how it takes the Bitcoin name. That's the controversy here.

Look at me ma! I'm top of the world!
