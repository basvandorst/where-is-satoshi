Same for my EUR deposit. Shows as complete (in funding) but not in ledger. Dogecoin went through.

A free Kraken account

I have a bank account in Europe and I have had incoming/outgoing payments suspended for KYC and/or returned. Recently I have had a payment to Africa that got suspended for 1 month.

Mempool-wise it's better to use Kraken these days

Same here. Daily deposits/withdrawals, clear rules, better rates than coinbase. Never had any issue/delay with Kraken. And then... this upgrade. They have repeatedly stated our funds are safe, I hope it is true.

Sender -&gt; Sender's Bank -&gt; Intermediary Bank -&gt; Kraken's Bank -&gt; Kraken
Kraken account level does not matter to intermediary bank. They wanted to know more about the transaction, and then they have declined processing the payment and returned it.
Not Kraken's fault. Complain to your bank.

Is your friend delusional? If true, he should get a lawyer.

I think as a buyer, you can buy where/how you want, it isn't illegal (but can be risky), whereas a seller, you indeed need to comply with AML.
