What an idiotic statement.  100k by 2030 would make it hands down the best retail investment vehicle on the planet

Other arguement - gold can be lab made now.  It's expensive, sure.  But in 50 years, who is to say that I can't create Lab Gold that is indistinguishable from real gold, and so gold becomes an inflationary resource, and that's a big problem.
What happens when we start mining asteroids, and metals/minerals around the world becomes a replaceable resource?
Bitcoin is IMPOSSIBLE to fake, and can move at the speed of light - that's powerful. 
You could also theoretically memorize your bitcoin address and key, and fly anywhere in the world, cross any country border with as much money as you want in your mind.  That's powerful.  Can't be seized by govts.

But what do you think happened when people realized gold was a store of value?? It doesn't happen overnight.  A good store of value can only be that, if enough people believe it to be a store of value.  And as people jump on the wagon, the price goes up.  As more and more people "buy-in" to using bitcoin as a store of value, the price will rise.  
You say the value is changing very rapidly, but YoY it's almost ALWAYS positive, except for 2014.  Thats 6 out of 7 years.

How do you expect bitcoin to catch on as a legit store of value, but at the same time you want it to remain at a stable price?  With a limited supply that is IMPOSSIBLE. Do you realize that?

Haha ok dude. I didn't mean ACTUAL gold, just like counterfeit money isn't ACTUAL money, but it can sure look like it.
Do you want to take a microscope with you every time you buy gold to make sure you're not buying lab gold/fake gold? I don't think so.

You tell me. 
Would you rather have $10k dollars worth of gold in your house, that if you ever needed to move requires physical exertion.
Or a thumb drive.
