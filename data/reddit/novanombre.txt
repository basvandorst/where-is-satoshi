This reads like half sponsored content for piper and half propaganda along the likes of peterT/luke's tired tirade against paper wallets.
The article is so biased I can't take much of it seriously and all it really says is paper wallets are easier to screw up.
Another point I don't see anyone ever claiming that a paper wallet is better than a hardware wallet, but that they are about the same level of security one is just more foolproof.

I've got to say I feel strongly the opposite, most of the people I see commenting on r/bitcoin don't appear to have any idea how Bitcoin works and they know nothing of the history, they "just want the price to go up", while most people that are against the centralization of development and of the data cap are *for* freedom of discussion and Satoshi's origianl idea of Bitcoin. 
There are far more early adpoters that think there is **no reason to fear a hard fork if it has been prepared for** and I can't find any evidence to dispute that. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 01:43:14
1) the data that supports your argument is from 2015 and says up to 4MB max blocks would only result in the worst 10% of nodes being dropped, that would aloow millions of new users some would run nodes
2) Satoshi said all full nodes should be in data centers in Bitcoin's future, he was okay with nodes and miners being data centers so there is no reason to think keeping so many small nodes at the expense of the network is a good idea

Satoshi suggested hard forking to upgrade when needed, there is nothing scary about it when done right and no one is curretnly proposing to do it no right. Educate youself please, for everyone who has to read these comments. 
@_date: 2017-02-14 02:39:34
Think about there being dozens of thousands or more data center like nodes, because every large business needs one to use Bitcoin, and bitcoin is being used by many people.
The people still don't have to trust that their funds will be stolen, and no group can steal anyone's funds.
That sounds decentralized to me. Also I think that was described by Satoshi as how bitcoin should oeprate in the future. 
@_date: 2016-03-26 17:13:44
I think a recent analysis says a jump in the data cap to 4MB wouldn't have heavy centralizing effect, even blockstream workers agree
@_date: 2017-02-15 04:32:32
1) HF were planned by Satoshi as a way to upgrade
2) HF were planned by Satoshi as a way for people who were unhappy with the code or development to gather support and move to a new set of rules they all agree on
3) there is no reason to fear a hard fork that is prepared for by all
3) if there was a hash power split, how would it happen? Right now btc-U would only activate with a bunch of the hashpower and that would leave the minority coin (with presumably already full blocks) to be slower and less secure. Plus if it costs more and is full, it might lose support quickly.
Don't you think anyone who wants to hurt btc see's there are only a few people right now with committ access and corrupting them is their best bet, followed by manipulating the public sentiment. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 01:44:32
Where are you getting that backwards idea? 
Bitcoin, at least Bitcoin from Satoshi, was about many txs, a very high volume of txs, all with small fees. Look through SN's ideas, lots of small fees is the plan, it's very clear the plan and the plan is why we are here.

Your post is exactly the type of problem referred.
Stop name calling, stop trying to divide and conquer. Each idea should be evaluated independently of its origin on its own merit. I have yet to see evidence that a 2mb data cap raise would hurt decentralization so trying to say everyone who is in favor of keeping the long held usability of btc is for a hostlie takeover is damaging to the community. 
If the majority agrees it isn't hostile, why don't we ever talk about the 'hostile stayover' then?
Censorship and a divided attitude (just like your comment) are the problems here.  That's part of the community. You are part of the cpommunity, so the community *is* part of the problem.
That is fairly obvious, you on the other hand make these suggestions that have no proof to back them up. IF you want to start following dollars you might find yourself looked disfavorabliy at the blockstream company

Interesting idea, what do you have to back that up?
To take it as is, who are these people do you think? And how or what is their plan to make money? Do you think there are a bunch of traders? Or people who are waiting for a magnitude level price rise so they can dump?
I don't really see how you can reliably make money off btc, at least not any better than anything else like a job. 
@_date: 2016-03-26 17:19:21
I disagree and I think Satoshi would have disagreed.
The ability for anyone to run a full node was not originally a long term plan for bitcoin. 
Should the nations of the world not produce VR games and applications because the internet service in the USA won't work with it?
[Here we discuss nodes being widely available but too expensive for normal people](
I think it's a great idea in theory but that it can't work with Bitcoin as deisgned, it may work with a new deisgn that isn't Bitcoin though.
@_date: 2017-02-14 21:32:30
No he really did mean full nodes, as full nodes were part of miners and he was okay with miners doing it then logically there is 0 reason to think he was not okay with full nodes also in data centers.
It's spelled out quite clearly, I would have thought you of all people would know this.

of course they work with blockchains still, one or a few blockchains will be big in the future, but bitcoin might not be one of them.
They might have done this because:
No one used it.
No one can use it (blocks are too full to reliably use argument)
Impending regulation, fungibility or btc tracking concerns, bad reputation

Where are you getting this idea?  I get that some of the COre devs think so, but I never got that impression from the whitepaper nor anything SN ever said, you can see almost all his posts online.
In fact, Satoshi spelled out how we should increase the blocksize whenever we hit it, implying blocks should never be actually full.

The extra-nonce analysis shows a lower bound of 300,000 btc mined by satoshi and Wright claims 1.1 million which is a reasonable upperbound.
I don't think we can count this as lost, I think they get their own category.
Past that we know some burner addresses and OP_RETURN outputs that are gone forever, we know of some btc that were buried like a treasure hunt, but I think the biggest potential lost coins are early coins mined and forgotten when the difficulty was very low.
Also, didi you try searching for this question and variations of it? I've seen it a few times at least

I see what you are saying in the context where a reasonable number of nodes could not handle the maxed out block size at the time, but connectivity and most other elements of technology has improved since then.             \Does that not mean that we *can* not handle bigger blocks without a significant drop in node or miner count and without and significant 'centralization of mining' ?

@_date: 2016-05-21 17:18:44


Yeah I just don't think this make logical sense in happening.
For 1. Bitcoin was never made so every poor person could host the full blockchain, that is nonsense and who here has reasoned themselves into thinking that idea and not been fed it?
2. If Bitcoin become more popular and used, more people will run nodes in other countries and bitcoin will become *more* decentralized in nodes and maybe miners, not less.
3. YOu are operating on the assumption that bitcoin should pay its miners with huge fees from a few users, I think the whitepaper never spells that out but more long time bitcoiners always read it as a high volume of low (see normal) fees will help the miners.
4. You also appear to think internet and technolgy will never get better, yes we've hit a 'wall' in moores prediction but if you pay attention there are other ways we can still improve things to scale with time.
Altogether I think you have some valid points but they are made on false assumptions. Point  more specifically.

I think it is clear from everything here:     satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org      
That the system was *designed* to start so pretty much everyone could run a full node but when the system grew up it would cost more money to run a full node than just running an extra computer. 
We can argue all day about if it should or should not *actually* be that way in the future, where hundreds of thousands of business and individuals and state offices all ran their own full nodes, which run on good internet connections (that people will need for VR/AR internet) with not-total-shit computers  and storage (1tb costs $100 right now eh and will only get cheaper in the future).
What we should do is find out where everyone stands on each issue and graph them. 
A lot of us are envisioning about totally different systems in the future and we're all using the same name to describe that system.      
This is a flawed approach, Perhaps you want btc3af and I want btc1ca?     
 We are never going to agree on much if we fundamentally want different things in the future. 
@_date: 2016-05-21 17:23:00
Forgive me for thinking doubling isn't the same.
Bitcoin is designed with spare capacity. Case and point, the creator, who deigned it, said we should increase the data cap when we hit it, and spelled out his designed that Bitcoin shouldn't be held against that cap.
Bitcoin *is designed* to not have full blocks. That is the fact of the matter, and it is uncontested.
Now that we have that out of the way, we can calmly and rationally discuss how the movement of development and use has changed bitcoin and what some perceive as the best way forward from where we are.
@_date: 2016-05-21 17:35:20
Perhaps full blocks don't matter themselves but their effect on the ecosystem sure does
@_date: 2016-05-21 17:26:56
Too-large blocks no, but remember the 2mb stopgap bip102 was largely rejected by the community as not doing enough in making block size bigger.
No one wants to hurt btc, no one wants too large. But tests have shown we can have larger but not too large blocks with little to no problem, 2 MB would be fine. However the Core client devs have stated they don't want to succumb to community pressure and raise the size as they would have to do it again later.
Now here is another point, you say decentralization but what do you mean? The decentralization Bitcoin was founded on was decentralization of mining, so no one could do a 51% attack.      
IN the last year many people have brought up that word but they don't mean it that way. they have another idea, one that doesn't seem to make any sense based on reality and that is that every poor person with shitty internet should be able to host the full blockchain. That is the disinformation, that is doing the damage.
