You're kidding, right? It's exactly the opposite of a store of value. A store of value is a commodity that has a predictable value based on it's intrinsic utility or desirability. Precious metals, gems, livestock - those are stores of value.
Bitcoin is *no* intrinsic utility. It's only worth something today because the people who buy it are betting that someone else will come along to buy it for a higher price. 
If the speculators stop buying, how much value do you think it's going to store?

No it didn't. Knock that bullshit off.

Nothing people call 'theft', apart from having your money *literally* stolen, is **ever** theft.

That is patently false.

Yes, that's true. And if you're content to trade it with each other like baseball cards, then more power to you. 
But bitcoin has neither intrinsic value nor fiat backing. If you don't *care* about the technology, you need a different incentive to change your money into Bitcoin. At this point, it was trying to profit off the bubble. 
If Bitcoin becomes worth very little USD for whatever reason, the tech still has all the advantages that proponents claimed it did, but no one will use it. It's deflationary, so you can't count on excess currency to offset the lost value - If a Snickers bar suddenly costs $2300 BTC, would you buy it? What happens if the price goes up to $200 a week later... You just ate a half million dollar Snicker's bar. 
So you do what everyone does with deflationary currency. You hoard it until the day it becomes worth something again. Except everyone is hoarding it, so it isn't being used and remains worthless. 
As of right now, the Bitcoin community has not made a good enough argument that using Bitcoin is better than using USD for purchasing things. I'm not talking "demonstrate the proof of concept", I'm talking about convincing the local pizza place to read and learn about it, figure out how to accept it and translate it to their local currency so they can pay people who don't accept it. 
It's not an unprecedented journey - Discover had to do that in my life time. I watched the adoption of Discover happen. Now I'd be surprised to find a retailer that didn't take it (in the US at least). 
Until that happens, it'll be nothing more than a technical curiosity for people to trade with each other. Early adopter retailers who have no vested interest in the technology behind it will abandon it if it loses money, and all the ground gained this year will be lost. 
You can't make rational investment decisions with Bitcoin. There are no fundamentals to track. You either "believe" in it, or you are speculating that enough people "believe" in it. That is, at best, a 'gut' reaction. That's how you lose money.

You're the one who is confused. Or at least deluded. People are speculating Bitcoin in the hopes of making money on the arbitrage, not converting their dollars into some other currency that might, one day, be more useful than having USD.

People like to argue. My sister argues with her 2 year old all the time. It's silly out of context, but that's life.

Everything is low risk in hindsight. Only a fool considers anything bitcoin to be low risk on the open market.

The Google Wave protocol was sound too. But people had trouble figuring out what problems Wave actually solved for them on a daily basis. And now Wave is dead. 
And Wave was free. 
"Because the protocol is sound" gives you nothing. The bitcoin protocol can only be used to exchange bitcoins. If there arent' enough people who want to exchange bitcoins, the protocol will be just another fad tech that no one remembers.

Except every single person who bought a bitcoin would dump it because they almost certainly bought it when it was higher than $100. 
Now you're back to a fringe currency that no one uses or accepts. Except now it's even harder to get people to convert money to Bitcoin because they remember the shitshow that happened the last time. 
You got what you wanted: interest from outside the community. That interest doesn't give a flying rat's ass about your principles or how much more secure the currency might be. They wanted to make money and instead they lost it. 
Fool me once, shame on me, fool me twice.... can't get fooled again.

And this opinion is based on... what? A single market event in China cause all bitcoins globally to lose half their value in a single day. Transferring money into Bitcoin at this stage for any reason other than sheer bloody minded principle is a terrible idea. How many more bubbles will have to form and pop before you are convinced?
