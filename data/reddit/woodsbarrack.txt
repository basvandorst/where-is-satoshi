They can make all local exchanges close based on non compliance to regulations or whatever other reason.
They can block most of other international sites from the Great Firewall. 
That would reduce drastically trading and access to bitcoin for Chinese.

Very common practice in China. A thing gets hype, soon after it gets the attention of the government and they break down on it. Road traffic, prostitution, foreigners working with travel visas, bitcoin trading... 
They must have forced the exchanges to publish regulatory reports and users data so they can track people using those services when needed.

Hack it

Bet they will start by blocking the site access within the Great Firewall...
Bitcoin and crypto currency in general is probably a pain for the government cause they can't control the system. That is why they are forcing local exchanges to "cooperate" which basically means give them the access to anything they want. 
When the Chinese exchanges allow withdrawals again be sure that the government will have access to all data including every users coins if they wish.

Currency exchange in China is very much controlled and limited to 50k usd per year per individual (works for both buy and sell). This is controlled by the banks which are obviously tightly controlled by the government. If the exchanges can't get to a similar level of close monitoring they will be closed. And if they do not close they will for sure have to implement new restrictions and rules for trading and withdrawal.

They will block the site soon enough.

Why did I read coin-cident?

Coinbase shows you the spot rate but they have a buy and sell rate, which is used for buys and sells. You can find those using API. That's how they guarantee the price and makes an instant buy or sell.
Agree it's expensive with the fees on top. 
You can open a gdax account which is coinbase exchange and use your coinbase wallets to buy there, should be cheaper.

What the fork is happening here?

Or Is it fantasy?

Jihan? Or is it an intended pun ? ;)

I don't think it will have such an impact. Maybe the Euro will go down though which can impact markets in general but hard to say what will it do to crypto markets.

+1 to that

That's too bad they are closing your account for this.
Always thought that PayPal should have embraced Bitcoin and become a Bitcoin wallet / payment system. They would have been able to setup Bitcoin payments in shops etc.

I live in China and from what I know about the Chinese administration, if they really want to shut them down they'll probably start by putting in place such very vague rules. Then it's easy to refer to any of those vague rules to kind of arbitrarily close any exchange they want. To me it's not certain that's not their goal yet.

Reason is dead simple. So the government can have a copy of your private key.

HAHA couldn't be worst than this !
