Sorry, but you don't understand the trade. You are carrying a bitcoin for the length of the contract, there is no stars aligning, it is locked in stone. There is the cost to carry, and risk of storage, but no trade risk.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:18:27
You make the same $1200. As you sell for less then you bought the bitcoin, but you make more on the futures contract. If there is no leverage, then they move exactly in lock step.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:22:11
Ok, you admit you can't sell Cboe futures, and I can't. So how can the supply meet demand? The only people that can sell them are institutional investors who can't execute the carry trade due to regulations on them holding bitcoin (the actual bitcoin asset), so the only way they can sell is to take risk. Which they are charging for, of course. That $1200 spread is a risk spread, which could be near $0 if it was possible for retail investors to sell short. This is my only point, that the market is mispriced because of that fact.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:50:59
Sure, but I can't sell to meet that demand . . . And neither can you (assuming you are not institutional). This is a problem.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:51:42
From what I heard from the brokerages I tried, it will be the same situation.
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:52:28


Not sure exactly what you are trying to say, but if someone places a 1000 coin order on gdax with a limit of 17250 or higher, the exchange will match that order against the order book, at one time, and all 1000 coins will be matched against the lowest available sell price on up until the order is filled, or the limit takes effect. This is just how exchange order books work. If you doubt me, have a look at [the trading rules number 1.21, 1.24, 1.27 and 1.30](
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:50:13
Yeah, that's exactly my point re institutional investors. And even whales can't sell futures, unless they somehow have a broker that will let them. I'm happy to lay down any margin a broker would request, but no one will let me.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:56:52
No, you aren't understanding the trade. At this time there is a risk free arbitrage of $1200. Here is the long explanation:
Step 1: Sell a Cboe JAN8 futures contract, and at the same time buy an actual bicoin on GDAX. At this time there is a $1200 spread between the two, in your favor.
Step 2: Wait. You can wait for the spread to reduce, or you can wait until settlement, whichever you prefer.
Step 3: (assuming wait until settlement:) Sell your bitcoin at the exact time the contract settles. You will receive the same price which you must pay your counterparty on the contract.
Step 4: Move the cash from GDAX to brokerage.
Step 5. You are done, you now have a $1200 gain in your account.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:03:16
Well it's been up there for like 20 minutes now, and as you would expect the market is moving away from it. News from Korea and the futures spread collapsing is freaking people out at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:00:51
Uh, yeah, the point of futures is that I can sell the future and lock in that price. Which is exactly what I want to do, sell that future, buy the coin, and take my $1200.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:35:50
I don't know anything about what the exchanges were thinking in building these products, but really, this is not their problem. The problem is on the retail broker side, where they will let clients take long positions but not short. They are protecting against their clients getting nasty margin calls on a short where the underlying rises, but are in effect forcing them into this bubble situation because there aren't people selling to them.
On the cost front, it is not only the "storage" cost that you have to consider, there is also the time value of money. For bitcoin this is huge, because of the volatility and the high margin requirements you would (if you were able to sell short of course) have to put down a LOT of cash in your margin account to cover your positions, and keep adding more if the price is rising. Compare to the margin requirements for Brent crude of only $2530 per 1000 barrels. That is because the markets know that it is not so volatile that you are going to get underwater so quick.
So, you pay more to physically store the crude, but you pay hardly anything to hold the contract. It's the opposite for bitcoin, where you pay almost nothing to store it, but the contract margin requires you to have a lot of cash locked up (which costs you money, in the form of opportunity cost if cash, or interest payments if you take a loan).
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:56:33
Yes, that is a strategy that works sometimes. However this sell wall doesn't seem to be that, as it hasn't moved, and it stood solid for about 10 minutes while about 150btc came off of it, so seems to be an actual sell . . .
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:22:41
Well the other way around, I am paying cash for a bitcoin to hold for the month, then selling it to cover the settlement, but yes. Though the settlement in cash is good for this, as I can have cash ready at all the points I need it, and not have to worry about moving the bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:42:36
The contracts are cash settled, and the cboe version is a contract for one bitcoin. So if you sold one contract, at settlement, you will pay the other party (though the exchange of course) the price of one bitcoin at the settlement time.
So, since you have held a bitcoin the month, and you sell it at the same time, you take that cash, and give it straight to the counterparty. So that is how there is exactly zero trade risk. You are holding the bitcoin, worth one bitcoin, you sell it, getting one bitcoin's worth of cash, and you give that to the counterparty. Doesn't matter if it has gone up or down, it is still worth exactly one bitcoin. The time when there was a difference in price between the contract and the underlying was when you bought the coin, and sold the contract, and thats when you locked in the $1200 spread. After that point you are just waiting a month. Nothing can happen to change the value of the asset you are holding (one bitcoin), or the amount you need to deliver  at the end of the contract (one bitcoin). The price moves against dollar just don't matter, everything is priced in numbers of bitcoin (one).
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:37:08
The problem was that initially no retail brokers were allowing anyone to sell short. The only people taking the other side of trades were institutional investors taking an actual short position, and so the spread was a risk premium. Over the last two days the spread has collapsed, so someone is in there running the arbitrage.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:09:04
Huh? You are not making much sense. I would sell the bitcoin for 20k, give that 20k to my counterparty, and walk with the $1200 difference from what I got for the contract, vs how much I paid for the bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:28:17
If you have access to short the CME futures when they come out, and a healthy margin account, keep an eye out for a large spread between the futures and the spot price (cost of an actual bitcoin). If the same thing happens with the CME that did with the CBOE, there is a very easy and riskless arbitrage to capture that spread called [cash and carry]( See also [this article]( on Bloomberg discussing the problems. If you want to learn more see [my post here](
Note though two things, first as the CME contracts are 5x, you have to put down a lot more cash to play in this market, and second the CME futures will be much more widely traded, so I don't expect the spread to last as long as it did for the CBOE.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:41:28
Here, do you trust Bloomberg? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:13:47
Yes absolutely. The classic example is oil, but it of course costs more to store than bitcoin does. But even so, you will never find the opportunity to make 3% in a month, because other people will have jumped on it before then!
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:19:57
No one on CBOE, Ally will be allowing people to short the CME, but with 100% margin requirement, so you better have a large, liquid account due them being 5x contracts.
Also the spread has collapsed on the CBOE, down to around $300-$500 on average. Still some money to be made, but much less lucrative, seems someone is in there taking the arbitrage.
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:30:14
Yeah that's how I'm calculating the approx. $30k cash needed, 44% on the future sold, 100% on the bitcoin bought, and then some extra to cover the margin if the price goes up. (Not interested in any leverage, would do it pure cash). If the price goes up a lot, I would have to dump cash in to cover, but doesn't add trade risk, just reduces yield.
Also, yes on calling out counterparty risk, also there is risk of volatility during settlement, particularly this first run, as no one has seen it before. (I would try and settle on my own before the actual settlement date to avoid this, I'm sure the spread will come down as the date comes closer). But as far as the trade itself goes, it's riskless arbitrage.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:14:17
My question is why no one is trading the February or March contracts. Those are open now yes?
Edit, ah there we go, a few trades on them, but super thin.
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:10:38
No, if there was a 1000 coin buy order put in for 17250 or higher, it would fully match that sell wall, and that's that. The only way a bot can move is if the orders are small orders eating it, a single order is matched on the exchange, and whatever size matches is executed.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:59:45
Yes, this is the exact issue, there is nowhere for a retail investor to sell short.
I started a thread over here: 
Tl;dr a bunch of people who don't understand futures contracts :)
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:06:46
Heh, yeah, if you see the thread I linked, it's kinda stunning how confused people are. I'm not a trader, and don't have any experience with options (which still confuse me a bit) or futures, but I find these futures to be extremely easy to understand, and the arbitrage opportunities as well. There was a 36% apr sitting on the table for 3 whole days there, wish I could have snagged some of that!
@_date: 2017-12-11 08:53:21
Can someone explain to me why I can't do a cash and carry arbitrage in the current situation: JAN8 future is $18620, spot price is $16860. So I sell one future and buy one actual bitcoin. wait till settlement, sell my bitcoin, settle the contract for the same price, and presto, riskless $1760 profit.
I'm not sure exactly how much cash I would have to put up to run this trade, but seems like about 30k no? So a great yield for sure. Must be missing something . . .
Edit: Matt Levine at Bloomberg agrees that this (was) a problem: 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:25:29
Not really, because your bitcoin has gone down. The amount you get is always $1200, minus costs.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:19:18
Not for a single order, which is what we are talking about here. Anyway this whole conversation is pointless, as this sell order has held firm even though sustained buy pressure.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:03:40
No problem if you like bubbles :)
But it is a problem if not, because the market is mispriced. It implies a 4% inflation of the dollar over a month, which no other markets are showing.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:51:53
You always net $1200 - costs. I don't know how more to explain it then I have already done elsewhere in this thread. Also check out this  [good explanation from sleemandj](
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:06:17
Well not really, if there was buy pressure, it would take about 10 minutes to half an hour, depending on how much cash the arbitrage bots have on gdax. But as long as people are running scared from the wall and just nibbling? Who knows.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:14:53
Yeah I didn't really go into the costs in the post above, because that is not the point, but here it is:
44% margin on the futures contract sell + 100% cash price on gdax = approximately $30k
That cost can vary of course if the price runs up, as I will have to provide more cash to cover, but I think the 30k is a pretty safe bet. Note that if I am wrong and you have to throw more cash at it, you are not losing money, just dropping your yield.
So, guessing the yield will be around 3% over a month, so, pretty damn good.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:13:01
Yeah, I think the good opportunities have passed on CBOE, and CME is going to be too rich for my blood, I don't have that much liquidity. And the spreads there will probably be even lower. Thanks though!
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:23:45
That guy at 19001.11 is silly. Anytime you are going to put a limit sell order near a round number, put it ***under*** the number, eg at 18999.99. That way if a market buy pushes up against the wall but doesn't break it, your order gets filled . . .
Their order is only for $56 more total, but much less likely to get filled.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:46:05
You have a 8,500 profit on paper, but you have lost 7,300 on your bitcoin position. Sure, you can turn that into a long position by closing your future, but you are effectively taking a new position at that point (which I agree would be a good choice). Just want to be clear at this point you have exited the arbitrage and entered a new position exactly the same as if you bought a bitcoin long at 10k.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:25:23
No, but it does freak people out. That's a big sell order. For context, if it had been a market price order rather than a limit, it would have taken the price down to about $15,600.

No, but I have one bitcoin, and I just sold it for that future price. So its almost like I did know ;)

All I have to do is buy the bitcoin now, hold it, then sell it, and I will get exactly what it is worth.

See this is the educated debate we need here. You both have good points, but I do tend to agree with you, the only reason for many currencies in the world at the moment is due to archaic nationalism.

Aligned interests. Not that they care about the common people, but that they want to keep china from dictating the government of hk. This coincidently is also what most people in hk want for many reasons, political freedom, as well economic. Of course if they succeed they will then need to fight the corporate conglomerates to retain autonomy, but if they don't make it out of China's grip, then there is no need to worry about that anyway.
