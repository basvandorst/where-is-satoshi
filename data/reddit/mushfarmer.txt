MDMA is overhyped.  Just like shrooms and lsd it can give a PTSD/depressed person a boost, but it is only temporary.  And unlike shrooms/lsd there is a severe comedown with MDMA (an no, supplements like 5 HTP do NOT quickly restore your body's own serotonin supply, it is much more complicated than that).  
Years ago my brother tried MDMA because he had chronic depression.  It did indeed improve his mood for a while and he said it helped because 'he got to feel what it actually felt like to be happy for a moment'.  Days after he was back to being depressed but had a more hopeful mood.  The only thing that actually eventually brought him out of depression was a better living situation and a better job.  Which is kind of obvious that that would for many people.

Shrooms and marijuana reportedly do the same thing, and they are a natural source with thousands of years of safe use.  MDMA nor weed is a permanent solution.
@_date: 2018-01-13 15:08:13
Therapy with MDMA will not 'cure' depression, but this is what many people believe.   It is not a permanent solution even with therapy.  Permanent solutions are like the example I gave of a better living situation.

I totally agree MDMA is better than the current pharmaceuticals like zoloft, xanax, etc.   But if someone's life is crap and they are using therapy + MDMA to improve it, it will be temporary until that person's life situation isn't crappy.  That goes for any drug.

Depression I think is equivalent to stagnation.  That is why seemingly well off people can still be depressed.  LSD/shrooms/mdma severely break that stagnation and you are right they offer new perspective.  But even that new perspective can get old.  I've taken shrooms/lsd probably a hundred different times in my life.  There were times when I was depressed that it improved things for a week or two, and there are times when not matter how much i took it all it did was make me think about how awful my life was.  Even if those times had been during therapy the outcome would not have changed because my reality was still the same.

They target folks who take deductions, that is what flags you for audits 99% of the time.  The capital gains for bitcoin is such a complex issue the IRS isn't going to do squat against the little guys.  For instance, what if I buy bitcoin off coinbase back in 2014, move it to a separate wallet, then move it back onto coinbase and sell it later at a higher value.  How is the IRS going to keep track of that and know it is the same bitcoin subject to capital gains.

Honestly, I do not believe anyone is going to receive any payout, bitcoin or monetary.  At this point the Japan government realizes they are making huge profit holding on to the btc.  Even the claims list shows everyone's payout at only equivalent $450/btc price (price at time of case).  So even if JP government pays that out, they still have made a huge profit.  It is a tragedy for the little guy.

I had an account with Gemini for over a year.  Sold about 5g worth of btc (no buys), and they closed my account saying I was 'high risk' and wouldn't say anything else about it (i followed all KYC and never had a problem with any other exchange).  It seems to me they didn't like the idea of me not making any buys on their exchange.

unfortunately i dont think companies like coinbase are going to adopt LN because it slightly delays the liquidity of their holdings.  And LN has a multisig dispute system where if one party fails to sign a timelock gets released for the previous contract, which can take minutes/hours/days depending on value (to the best of my knowledge).

"Lightning" network does not "speed" up the transaction process, as it uses time locks where channels can wait hours/days for parties to sign the multisigs.  What it does do is take some stress off the main network, but it is only going to be applicable in situations where future payments are predicted between the same two parties in a short amount of time (I can't think of any examples).
Can someone tell me where I am wrong?
@_date: 2017-08-24 14:02:44
How are you going to convince Coinbase, etc to use LN when it locks up some of their liquidity to move coins, and creates timelocked multisigs that can delay transactions when there is a dispute with one of the parties on a payment channel/channel group?

Then that store owner records you (on video) as a thief/con like any other conman and works towards your arrest if you return.  99.9% of btc payers will be legit even on a 0 confirm.  That is the risk of business.

When i pay through bitpay the transaction is instant with 0 confirms.

Services like Bitpay are instant with 0 confirms.  I don't see  a problem.

IMO no one is getting anything back ever.  I think the JP government 'owns' this trustee and has secretly transferred/sold the coins in a heist.

I've known this for a while but never had a good source of the info, thx!  It was the first example in history of a mass breaking of contract law, and no one ended up paying and going broke.

And as the story goes all of the contracts were broken and NOBODY lost huge sums of money like historians make up.  It was not an example of a market bubble bust, but rather an example of the first major break in contract law.

Saudi Aramco, world's largest oil producer, is going public with their IPO next year which will reveal they have trillions of barrels in reserve instead of just billions.  The world markets will be rocked as the price of oil plummets.  Bitcoin will soar.

They don't, the fear is overblown.  That is why the IRS is fighting to force coinbase to give over their transaction records, but haven't won the case yet.

Payouts from the mtgox case will be in Yen pegged around $450/btc.  Which even that may never happen.

Only if the income was reported.  Coinbase says they may report exchanges in the future to the IRS, but localbitcoins does not report any transactions.  Otherwise you are going to be having to deposit 100k+ to redflag.

That's because you owed money on income that was traceable to a 1099, etc and a claim against you could easily be processed.  The $75k he cashed through localbitcoins isn't being reported by anyone.  His bank doesn't know where the 75k came from, for all they know it came from him saving taxed income throughout the years in cash and choosing to deposit it now.

Think about this, the government wants you to pay capital gains on btc-&gt;usd, but refuses to allow you to deduct capital losses (like mtgox folks).  How is that not theft by government?

The IRS is not going to audit this guy over 75k, they only have the resources to go after much larger fish with business accounts.

Most sites that use bitcoin payments accept 0 confirmation transactions (like bitpay service).  And same site have more info on you than just your bit address so if you defraud them they will criminally charge you.

Reporting doesn't mean they do anything about it, the IRS is understaffed and automation only goes so far.  I wired $10k+ several times 3 years ago from bitstamp into my bank account.  Never taxed.  No problems.

Then go with coinbase's usa competitor and quityourbitchin.  If it was an easy task there would be more large usa exchanges/trading sites.
