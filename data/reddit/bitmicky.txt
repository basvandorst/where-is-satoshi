@_date: 2017-08-03 10:17:53
agree, but we need homework for it 
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:06:41
an interesting jump 
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:52:52
@_date: 2017-08-25 05:56:30
it is possible
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:07:47
@_date: 2017-08-09 12:41:01
great jump! But why Bitcoin's price decreases?
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:33:55
"what if" means, we are supposed to
@_date: 2017-08-04 11:31:51
I read somewhere that Satoshi's coins are basically Bitcoins and we are Bitcoin user. I am not sure about it, that's asking on this platform. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:33:07
what? 
@_date: 2017-08-07 12:40:41
seriously ??? ;) 
@_date: 2017-08-04 05:21:30
wishing, Bitcoin is not going to have a tough time in future.
@_date: 2017-08-07 07:18:11
@_date: 2017-08-09 10:34:53
It's time to move on. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 08:01:55
what about Ponzi schemes?
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:45:30
he has a good point to excuse 
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:45:10
you can start 
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:32:56
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:53:20
I'll plan the world tour 
@_date: 2017-08-28 05:40:38
Uber is going to take an adventures ride, Dara has the idea How to run a Business.
@_date: 2017-08-04 08:34:12
finally, Bitcoin is going in control of a powerful authority 
@_date: 2017-08-05 12:16:14
great jump after August 1, I think it may cross $5000 soon
@_date: 2017-08-05 12:12:15
best couple ever 
@_date: 2017-08-09 07:16:45
may be. we are expecting the good one.
@_date: 2017-08-09 12:35:17
@_date: 2017-08-09 07:51:33
agree, 
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:09:11
or Jap-Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-08 06:37:38
it is not too bad ... 
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:59:46
you did a mistake dude
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:47:35
It is possible when Bitcoin covers its journey safely.
@_date: 2017-08-09 12:09:24
@_date: 2017-08-09 07:12:10
Everything is clear now. Bitcoin will remain the same with its dignity.
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:03:19
let's see 
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:42:18
@_date: 2017-08-04 08:28:25
split n split n split...................
@_date: 2017-08-08 07:30:09
it will come at 5K soon 
@_date: 2017-08-07 08:31:35
@_date: 2017-08-09 11:02:36
ok tell me, which circumstances are the reason for Bitcoin price fluctuation
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:55:01
The tortoise should try with whole power, will do it. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:48:17
it's great! more than my expectations. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 11:55:23
which platform is completely secure? Do you aware Germany's largest exchanges' act?
@_date: 2017-08-07 06:17:04
most of them are destroyed 
@_date: 2017-08-08 07:31:56
no 
@_date: 2017-08-08 06:44:35
Yes, you can buy but be aware of scams. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 11:26:18
I know that, em talking about the logical reason. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 10:00:47
things are going on. Doesn't matter good or bad
@_date: 2017-08-07 07:30:58
Is Satoshi Nakamoto has 1 million Bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:22:42
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:42:36
why? do you think about it? 
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:21:27
It's a miserable nightmare.... 
@_date: 2017-08-05 11:14:30
may be or may be $5000
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:11:54
that's a reason. we don't know the power of our rights. somebody say yes, our reply is yes. someone looks at the sky, we look toward sky without any reason. Actually, we are enjoying the nightmares. But the question is, how long?
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:56:10
Didn't get any thing? :(
@_date: 2017-08-08 07:28:00
you have to follow the limitations, 
@_date: 2017-08-04 08:31:13
hahaha not the first time they are doing this 
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:55:49
yes, I am sure, its the beginning 
@_date: 2017-08-07 07:14:28
You need to visit  
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:35:21
why? means, Bitcoin is going to have a tough time in future? 
@_date: 2017-08-28 05:46:18
so sad :(
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:03:44
@_date: 2017-08-05 11:01:45
Jesus! 
@_date: 2017-08-05 08:35:45
Woooww! not a big deal 
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:41:46
@_date: 2017-08-21 07:13:09
maybe? 
@_date: 2017-08-04 10:50:21
BTC will gets mad
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:16:23
 Bitcoin faucets 
@_date: 2017-08-04 07:17:18
funny money or best money? 
@_date: 2017-08-04 07:06:48
may be. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:51:34
agree.. but afraid of split again and again.
@_date: 2017-08-04 10:54:43
seriously? 
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:14:27
no, it's not illegal 
@_date: 2017-08-09 13:01:18
nobody knows, what happens next 
@_date: 2017-08-09 10:33:21
Afterall he is genius 
@_date: 2017-08-05 08:00:07
its price is unpredictable, August 1 's act boosts up its value.
@_date: 2017-08-09 05:16:17
you shouldn't :(
@_date: 2017-08-09 06:35:56
We will have digital currencies instead of fiat money 
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:08:46
interesting! that was real or fake? be aware 
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:37:48
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:45:52
Things are different but point remains the same
@_date: 2017-08-08 07:03:35
@_date: 2017-08-09 04:32:12
seriously! you should talk to her.
@_date: 2017-08-08 07:24:29
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:42:00
Did you think Illuminati exposed anything, anytime? 
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:23:40
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:07:50
Is it possible? 
@_date: 2017-08-07 07:55:59
hopefully 
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:06:05
exactly. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:01:22
I don't have any idea about this shit!
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:40:35
may be. and, yes I know Germany's largest exchanges' act. They hand over customer's data including IP addresses to police for investigation. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:55:03
online buying is the best option.
@_date: 2017-08-09 12:07:54
interesting morning ever
@_date: 2017-08-07 05:41:17
They are addicted to Bitcoin as cocaine.  
@_date: 2017-08-04 10:56:38
Wow! it looks amazing, what are the fees?
@_date: 2017-08-07 07:17:40
yes...  its too late but not the end. you have several options, you can them, trade them or mine them.
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:09:18
Once upon a time - its past now 
@_date: 2017-08-04 07:56:05
good, what John Macafee will do? 
@_date: 2017-08-05 12:37:10
agree with your guess, but isn't weird?
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:00:42
because when someone steps into the Bitcoin world, never ever think about leaving or coming out.
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:18:55
that information is publicly available on different platforms 
@_date: 2017-08-03 08:38:17
means we are going to have a wondering change. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:12:18
GDAX is much better
@_date: 2017-08-09 07:54:48
what's the matter?
@_date: 2017-08-07 10:55:10
amazing! great jump after a little nap 
@_date: 2017-08-04 08:02:07
anonymous support!
@_date: 2017-08-04 05:18:31
may be
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:04:25
agree 
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:52:54
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:41:12
I don't know you were telling truth or not. And, I don't want to know, but, It's just a discussion, It may a myth or rumor or whatever. I read a lot of data regarding this. But the thing is, we are on the same platform, we should have abusing sort of discussion. 
And, yes, it may or may not be that kind of Illuminati. we will get the answer after discussion.
@_date: 2017-08-07 06:17:37
@_date: 2017-08-04 07:21:07
Because they are more advanced :-D
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:05:22
its awsome 
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:09:04
oh! it's great. you are the real man who used to abuse anyone anywhere. seriously, it's a quality of real men.By the way, yes, it's public. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 07:19:33
didn't get your point?
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:48:52
they are going to invest in Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-08-08 06:03:56
good news ever
@_date: 2017-08-04 07:02:58
agree, but if coin's split process will going on, I don't think so, that it will have a shiny future.  
@_date: 2017-08-08 07:41:30
Bitcoin is not anonymous. All the data is registered publically. How can we say that it's anonymous?
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:46:57
How is Bitcoin going to destroy socialism? while we know, Bitcoin is a friendly product? 
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:58:32
seriously, they are people with a wonderful sense of humor. You know, like the psychopath, dual personalities.
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:49:13
I didn't get anything. can you tell me?
 
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:23:13
means we are going to fantasy land in future ;-) 
@_date: 2017-08-09 12:06:57
That's a good news,
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:01:07
I think it's a time to take off for an adventurous trip. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 07:33:14
obviously, Bitcoin has a bright future. Yes, I will be invested in it. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:39:32
isn't tricky?
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:25:46
you need a break :p 
@_date: 2017-08-07 06:54:53
I am waiting for them. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:54:25
yes.. its unneccesary
@_date: 2017-08-03 07:06:01
isn't weird? 
@_date: 2017-08-04 08:26:50
hmm.. hope for the best
@_date: 2017-08-09 07:14:07
@_date: 2017-08-03 12:49:09
It's confirmed, that it is not anonymous
@_date: 2017-08-04 08:09:53
they need to, But why they don't?
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:59:15
it's getting tricky
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:26:18
ins't ?
@_date: 2017-08-09 12:34:06
isn't costly?
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:41:24
a day after tomorrow 
@_date: 2017-08-18 07:49:46
@_date: 2017-08-07 06:59:10
not yet but hope for the best.
@_date: 2017-08-05 12:27:02
I don't think so, its price will be dropped 
@_date: 2017-08-07 07:06:20
It's all up to you, invest in which you are comfortable
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:28:01
Ukraine has taken a good step. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:05:13
it will take some time hopefully 
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:29:56
well done 
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:00:01
I don't think so 
@_date: 2017-08-18 10:24:09
good job
@_date: 2017-08-04 07:19:12
How can we? we were unable to stop August 1's act. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 10:15:09
These are predictions, somehow, it may true. But, the thing is, Bitcoin price gets more fascinating
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:33:59
aww! isn't too late? 
@_date: 2017-08-04 08:16:35
1.sell for another 
2.short sell 
3.buy cheap
@_date: 2017-08-09 07:15:26
good! 
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:52:08
I think it's 1993
@_date: 2017-08-09 10:53:41
for high jump!
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:57:11
no doubt, reliable platform it is 
@_date: 2017-08-07 05:56:57
Because of its price
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:36:42
wow! everyone's reaction 
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:49:40
I don't have enough Bitcoins 
@_date: 2017-08-08 07:39:59
ahan! no need of tissues. They already have
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:08:40
the dark theme on twitter, cool!
@_date: 2017-08-28 04:52:18
agree, but people njoy the changes 
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:50:34
its all about luck 
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:58:01
may be. we don't know. But it is clear that a strong, no no, strongest power is behind it. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 07:08:00
agree 
@_date: 2017-08-04 11:32:51
ok.. Thank you 
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:38:44
same here :(
@_date: 2017-08-09 07:13:29
Disgusting! How can we stope them? 
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:04:01
I think its not a big deal, nothing is going to happen. Everything will remain the same after today. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 08:07:39
yes, it is
@_date: 2017-08-07 06:32:16
I knew it! Japan nailed it... em glad
@_date: 2017-08-07 06:51:03
that was miserable, 
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:55:31
He knows, What he has to do. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 11:18:37
can you discuss it in detail? what will you say about Paul Walker's death?  
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:16:27
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:21:58
it's too late 
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:25:07
there is no way. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:28:35
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:48:26
you shouldn't wait
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:57:24
yes, But scammers' are the people who use 5% of their mind.
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:41:54
Gold is some thing else, while Bitcoins is different 
@_date: 2017-08-05 12:07:37
emmmmm.. Bcash obviously
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:01:50
I don't think so 
@_date: 2017-08-18 12:23:25
wow! interesting 
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:06:57
no, I don't think so 
@_date: 2017-08-17 11:54:29
Jesus help!
@_date: 2017-08-09 04:46:31
you should hold. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:23:17
@_date: 2017-08-04 05:56:07
hmm.... I think they want to take control of cryptosystem.
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:31:10
I don't think so there is a big bubble about to burst 
@_date: 2017-08-03 08:54:41
is this possible? what about the news, Bitcoin reaches $500,000 by 2030? Snapchat first investor's estimation. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 07:25:00
wtf? I didn't get it?
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:03:48
It's interesting 
@_date: 2017-08-07 06:22:21
should wait until segwit.
@_date: 2017-08-05 12:52:49
How can I get it? 
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:37:37
a step back for highest jump 
@_date: 2017-08-09 08:14:35
@_date: 2017-08-05 08:37:06
fingers crossed!
@_date: 2017-08-04 12:12:25
you should wait 
@_date: 2017-08-04 07:10:43
we will wait for the best.
@_date: 2017-08-03 07:02:59
glad to see this sort of things. Why it's not getting common around the world?
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:55:46
same here, I have the same issue 
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:36:46
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:59:05
@_date: 2017-08-09 10:15:03
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:15:26
@_date: 2017-08-04 07:37:11
I don't think so, ATMs need parents. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 07:17:40
agree 
@_date: 2017-08-05 11:17:21
yes! Bitcoin is kind ov cocaine. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 04:20:42
may be, but I don't think so. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 08:11:16
@_date: 2017-08-08 06:39:46
but it may
@_date: 2017-08-21 04:26:26
you need to wait
@_date: 2017-08-07 07:58:50
the Bitcoin revolution is my favorite
@_date: 2017-08-04 11:35:33
may privacy get change
@_date: 2017-08-09 04:42:35
@_date: 2017-08-17 12:48:16
2013, horrible nightmare 
@_date: 2017-08-04 07:16:41
glad to see the progress of the Bitcoin. can you tell me the transaction fee?
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:50:37
It doesn't create any impact on BTC's price 
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:42:38
How can I earn Bitcoin, Everyone around has the same question that how they can earn Bitcoin. People have different ideas, different queries about it. Unfortunately, nobody knows the exact way of earning.
There are a lot of process of earning, you can do mining, you have the option of Bitcoin lending and you can also invest in the Bitcoin. Hence, there is a number of ways where you have an opportunity to earn coins. You just need to focus on your target. When you reach the exact way, you can become a billionaire. Its only depend on your skills. How you handle the things?and how you manage your spendings?
The most prominent way of earning Bitcoin is trading. What is trading and how we can trade with Bitcoin? For the trading purpose, you need a huge audience. When you achieve your target you will be able to pinch your point of view accordingly.
Make money with existing Bitcoin is an easy task for you if you have the wide range of audience. You have the option to arrange a seminar and talk about trading with your business community and friends as well.
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:56:27
me :)
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:52:18
Are you sure?
@_date: 2017-10-18 12:43:19
I don't think so
@_date: 2017-07-24 08:03:07
In my opinion, China wants to be the hub of each technology. china's copies of everything ruin the real value of a product. you can see Chinese copies in your surroundings at low cost. but, on another side, low price of commodities or services provides relief to third world countries. Now, China is going to take over Bitcoin, it is not a big deal. Because Bitcoin is a currency which is not controlled by any government. The situation will be quite different if it holds 50%, and this is difficult to attain that percentage.

Global mobiles data revenue is USD 32billion per month and $4.8billion represent the returns from unused data. This is the DENT's calculation. If Bitcoin technology is continuously growing with the same speed, the Future of mobile phones and Blockchain will be bright. And the action of forwarding data will create incredible impact in under-developing countries.

agree Electrum is lightweight as compared to the Bitcoin core. But the thing is, Bitcoin core is lazy but more secure  
@_date: 2017-07-25 05:39:37
yes, transaction process will slow down. And automatically, prices will get higher. But, here the question is, why China needs to do so? while China has already taken over many sectors. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:28:26

I don't think so that all the data on Google is fake. Anyways, Bitcoin lending is a better option at the low rate.

we need to agree with following parallel upgrades to Bitcoin protocol. 
First, Activation of Segregated Witness at an 80% threshold, signaling at bit 4. 
Second, Activation of the 2MB hard fork with 6 months.
58 Companies in 22 countries are supporting the scaling, means scammers will have tough time 
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:32:38

there is a chance of split, not confirmed. If a segment of Bitcoin users activates the soft fork (USAF) as describe in proposal BIP 148. They will reject to not supporting the SegWit. If majority deny and don't support to SegWit through BIP 148 on August 1st, then split possibilities are there. Otherwise not. In the end, It is just a chance not confirmed. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 05:13:55

He is on the wrong track ... Bitcoin is much better for him as compared to the Altcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-26 12:10:58
I am excited. let's see what happens. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 08:48:50
its all depend on the situation. isn't? These days, Bitcoin is only processed up to 1 MB transaction in 10 minutes. Owing to the same limit, transactions take a long time for approval because of the heavy use. In a short, users have to pay heavy fees and increase in network nodes makes it more costly.
There are two algorithms are the Segregated witness and BIP 148 are there to solve the scaling problem of the Bitcoin.
hard fork is introduced which is not compatible with older software with the expansion of 2 MB instead of 1 MB.
The exchange rate may drop after 1 August 2017.

lets suppose, i have 1btc in my wallet, after split, i should have 1btc and 1bcc. why i don't claim in case of import key into a bcc wallet, if i hold private key? 
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:43:37
yes, you are absolutely right. But don't you think that each platform has such kind of nasty and malicious scams.     
@_date: 2017-07-27 11:02:21
can you elaborate it? 
@_date: 2017-07-26 10:53:50
you need to keep the separate wallet. second, try to avoid saving in your web wallet, protect your privacy means never share your private key with anyone in any case. keeps your wallet at cold storage and have a backup of your wallet. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 07:13:58
