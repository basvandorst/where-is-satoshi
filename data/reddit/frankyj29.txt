Btc needs something like this

How is this practice what you preach? I'm assuming he / she didn't HODL for this car. Or at least that's the perception they are giving out from this photo.

My goal was to do a test transfer to an exchange and then do some trading. I really would love for btc to become a currency that can work world wide but currently it's just a commodity that can't be used for mini transactions.  
It basically went away from what it started as and by no fault to the Dev team. It just grew to quickly to fast

Please read previous replies.  It was just a test.  Small amount for you maybe but at the time it was close to 1K. And for me 1K is not a small amount of change to do a test. And why would I even post here if I was spamming the network on purpose?  Sounds counter intuitive to me.

Just a reminder,  btc wasn't developed for investment but for getting rid of the fiat currency and banks.

Not as pertty but it does the job ��

Agreed.  I did a transfer for 0.05 BTC on the 19th from blockchain to Kraken.  Fees were 10$ and I'm still in confirming mode.  my question is both support Segwit so why were the fees so high!? I didn't even take the highest one of 20$. And why am I still waiting?  
I know you can't cancel a transaction but I'm hopping Kraken can refund me since it's taking so long.  
This is the reason why BTC can't be adopted by the mass.

10$ fee on 700-900(depending on btc price). Is definitely not economical. Lol. Fuck the miners but hell we need them also.  Sounds like a relationship ��

1.Any particular Visa/MC you would recommend? A quick search came back with cryptopay as a good method for MC or Visa. 
2. Are you suggesting to go to localbitcoin and sell them in the countries currency I will be traveling to?

HODL pictures of expensive car license plates are contradicting.  I one retrospect the user is telling you to keep your BTC but in an other they are saying to spend them. ����
@_date: 2018-10-13 23:05:08
Kudos for doing your research lol
@_date: 2017-08-07 20:53:46
I see what you did here. Well done, you get my up vote. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:48:14
Snort comes to mind,  amp for Endpoints another one

Why keep saying Hodl when posting pictures of things purchased with BTC?
@_date: 2018-03-07 01:31:18
Agreed. The entire thing is a FUD. Keep reading,  do your research and question everything but don't pass judgement on the 1st few sentences you read...keep it reall my friends 
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:48:13
Why is this not at the top of Reddit? How is this FUD? I would like to have a legal expert or blockchain expert put in more details on this. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 17:23:37
Agreed that the article is one sided but if the community is half witted as I think it is then they should up vote it with explanations why this isn't relevant. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 22:21:53
Finally,  someone who admits it without bulshit. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:15:42
hahahaha!!!! love the part in the clip where Jamie just bashes his own daughter...."My daughter just called me and told me she has 3 BTC...my formerly smart daughter"...WTF would you say that about your own child. 
@_date: 2019-09-09 10:54:00
And then pray to the BTC gods when you open it��
@_date: 2019-09-08 12:38:20
Hope you have recovery keys....Electronics touching  metal+ possible static electricity = going crazy if and when BTC reaches 1million and you can't do a recovery ;)
