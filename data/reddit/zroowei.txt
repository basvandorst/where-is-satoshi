eu banks ask the exact same info when you open an account, its mandatory kyc/aml stuff. bitstamp is just trying to cover their ass in case the taxman comes asking for info about you.


open a ticket and ask them.
since my bank asked me to update that exact info shortly after sending LESS THAN 1k eu to bitstamp, i didnt mind filling up the form when i got the warning a few days later on bitstamp.
whenever you deal with fiat you have to expect this type of shit. if you have a viable alternative use it and dont take that crap from them.


me neither, just fiat in and btc out.
