DOGE! It's a good thing for BTC too! I love 'em both!
@_date: 2014-07-23 18:48:24
Sounds great!
@_date: 2014-02-04 13:18:53
I'm a huge fan of both.  I like to think BTC and DOGE will be 1 and 2. They go well together ... yin and yang

What's the original quote?
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:52:42
Wouldn't selling $500,000 worth automatically place one into the highest bracket? Isn't that part of your income for the year? Thus, one would pay 20% taxes on their long term capital gains.
Or if you're unemployed all year, you could sell your $500k worth of long term btc holdings and pay $0 tax on it?

What would this be?
@_date: 2013-04-08 20:39:41
Actually that's a very large bedroom. Definitely much larger than average for the US.
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:10:41
I personally am not day-trading, BTC or otherwise. just watching from the sidelines. or furthering my experience.
@_date: 2013-06-14 22:38:12
~10%. Seems reasonable enough to believe.
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:48:57
and I just sent over 4500...:[

And Bitcoin got some fame from Cyprus, it was being mined during the banking crisis. 
@_date: 2013-05-13 11:30:52
DO you still own any bitcoins or did you cash out everything? Will you continue using bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:06:41
no. no I haven't. why all of a sudden?
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:09:33
Forget muting. It woke me up too. I cranked that shit!
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:20:12
I remember hearing about bitcoin a couple years ago and thinking people were crazy and not too concerned about losing their money with bitcoin. Now, to me, people are crazy and not too concerned about losing their money with banks.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:56:05
Oh I see now. Ha. Sorry, I'm all discombobulated.
@_date: 2013-06-13 14:44:07
No CampBX love?

@_date: 2013-10-02 15:42:34
Super cool. What about a currency exchange machine? Something that you can send and receive both fiat and BTC?
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:59:09
what the hell is going on?
@_date: 2013-07-05 03:32:39
This is interesting. Seems like it could be more friendly for people new to the BTC game. I'd love to try it out! Thank you.
@_date: 2013-05-30 20:36:58
Exactly! Bitcoin *is* money.
@_date: 2013-10-22 14:26:17
@_date: 2013-07-26 19:12:46
Do you know the timing on non-IAFCU accounts?
Thanks for all of your work with this!
@_date: 2013-06-14 16:54:45
That's reassuring. Thanks
@_date: 2013-10-22 21:25:59
How do you send a first-timer coin if they don't have a wallet already set up? Assuming that's what happened here.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:25:59
That's around $10,000 in cash 0.o
@_date: 2013-10-22 14:08:46
I hope he keeps doing it :)
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:58:43
If you transfer a large amount, percentage-wise, it's a small fee.
@_date: 2013-06-01 02:33:26
sir, I believe you were wrong... plz come back
@_date: 2013-10-25 16:35:11
Can be turned off by the owner.
@_date: 2013-08-03 02:00:45
Whatever works
@_date: 2013-10-23 17:40:33
Try Baidu trends on the Chinese for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:07:06
[I should have concurred](
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:01:52
haha, it's Bob...Bob had bitch tits
@_date: 2013-04-20 23:28:21
Where did you accept donations?

He may as well be referencing bitcoin in this speech.
@_date: 2013-10-23 18:19:04
[This seems to be their equivalent](
Doesn't seem significant (very low compared to March/April), but don't search keyword trends trail price?
@_date: 2013-04-09 11:24:00
I'll try: 1DV2YsveVxXtGpf4JFVPUA76fHyZfHYdKS
@_date: 2013-09-21 16:40:24
Yep, 5 of that BTC used to be mine....
@_date: 2013-10-25 16:35:31
Can be turned off by the owner.
@_date: 2013-09-05 17:40:52


@_date: 2013-04-09 13:31:46
haha. same thing here!
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:06:38
so where are we? anger at seeing all these damn charts, or have we moved on to depression yet?
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:51:52
Get ready to buy!
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:21:43
What is the point of a .2 second gif? Why bother at that point?
@_date: 2013-06-04 20:09:44
I think I'm missing the whole concept here. Is there an ELI5 of this? 
@_date: 2013-06-23 14:22:28
It's all good. It's a teaching moment.
@_date: 2013-07-06 23:07:43


@_date: 2013-04-19 21:07:09
and what does it give you?
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:12:02
Pretty baller. Buenos Aires always appealed to me. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 14:50:38
Same situation here.
One good thing to note is that I initiated a peer-to-peer payment just before the news broke, and they cancelled it and returned it to my checking account. So, I don't feel too worried. I'm sure they have a lot of work ahead of them. And who knows how many people have been sending emails. I'll try to maintain my patience.
@_date: 2013-10-23 18:34:36
Correct, I get what you're saying. People do need to first hear about Bitcoin before searching for it. This happens for many during big price movements. So, I would think there's some lag there.
@_date: 2013-05-22 18:08:08
That's good. One less thing
@_date: 2013-04-05 17:25:51
[waiting to hear something like this](
@_date: 2013-05-06 17:16:47
How do you read the bottom chart on this page:  ?
@_date: 2013-11-01 15:53:03
TIL. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-10-29 16:55:07
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:26:54
I'm thinking $1,000
@_date: 2013-04-19 13:51:05
TIL [LIX](
@_date: 2013-04-01 16:51:00
Truth, but there's psychology at play here too. There are reasons why casinos use chips instead of cash.
