What do you mean taking profits off the top?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:38:56
Do we still think that BTC will run upwards of 20k? My hodl game is wavering
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:12:20
That's awesome. Sounds like a good move! Congrats! Go one now, y'free. Go
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:07:00
Just waiting for 20k to actually happen. Damn.
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:02:01
Can someone explain what a sell wall is and how I can see this on gdax pls
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:16:36
Did you buy most of your BTC super low? What would you say about people getting into BTC today? Missed the train?
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:48:07
I see you bought at/around a new ATH. I have a ways to go before club membership. Should I continue buying or wait for dips?
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:10:58
Back to 10k plus. I'm new and I'm going through all the noob feelings. If we dip back into low 9k zone, I'm gonna buy more. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:22:13
Don't you worry that each month you'll be buying at higher and higher price?
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:26:36
Lol BTC would be at 20k by 12/8. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:33:19
At what price dip are you hoping to buy more? I think I may get some if it hits $9.2k again. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:25:11
Gotcha - and you're seeing this as an entry opp?
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:29:40
Jealous of all members of the 21 million club
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:21:54
Thanks. I didn't have the capital to get into it before, so I don't regret it. But this just seems so awesome haha.

Hey, easy stuff here but walk me through it. 
You invest $1,000 and see a 20% increase. Does that mean you sell on Coinbase, say, $200 bucks of BTC and keep it in your wallet and keep the rest in the game?
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:41:13
Can you help me understand what this means? Price goes down. There are whales standing by with the goal of keeping it low (so that they can buy more?). How do they make it go down? Scare people into thinking the shit is gonna hit the floor and then swoop in with more buys for cheap?
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:45:38
Gotcha 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:04:35
Yea, I feel that. I just started looking at this stuff this Tuesday lol so I'm defiantly new. Now that I have skin in the game, tho, I'm definitely attentive - perhaps too much. 
But after seeing the correction from my $10.2 to $9-8 It was hard to not tell myself to sell and wait for another dip and start again. Since it spent so much time in that range. 
Probably for the best m, tho, my Coinbase bank acct purchase hasn't yet cleared, so I've had to chill and wait and watch. 
I thought I was dumb for not dipping out after a solid 10% again. But now I see we've leveled a bit. 
Thanks man
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:40:38
Yep - someone linked me to the relevant sub and there were a lot of sad and anxious comments 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:35:34
Thank you for this! 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:35:36
Won't be doing it, to be clear. But it seems there are some people doing it and I'd like to know their rationale. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:24:57
What does this mean? Still don't understand GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:52:17
I don't say this often but damn I hope Ja Rule is right. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:23:14
12k on gdax
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:23:00
Sorry, I mean - what does that mean? A price dip?
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:59:34
What is Segwit? Sorry. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:19:23
Not a productive response but thank you. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:11:39
On what coins, if you don't mind. Right now I'm only on btc eth ltc. Waiting on verification on other exchanges for alts tho. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:28:43
Oh, I see. I'm just getting familiar with the culture around here. Thanks! And good luck! 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:34:48
Honestly, I'm real beginner but I would expect it to drop into the $9k range again. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:05:24
I would like to hear people's take on this. I bought on 10k. So I can't help but want to sell when I break even and buy on a dip and sell again when I've made a decent percentage gain. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:15:16
When did you start buying? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:18:45
Nice - I've only recently bought in and I'm hoping such a future is still possible. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:45:17
I'm in
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:07:28
Price dips this morning. Y'all buying?
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:53:09
7 days
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:46:23
I'm in!

Is Bitconnect a scam? Went down a Youtube rabbit hole.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:02:23
Where do y'all think/hope btc will be by 1/1/18. By 4/1/18? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:02:50
I bought recently at around $10,050. Waiting to clear. I'm getting nervous and wondering if I shouldn't sell when it clears $11k again. If it takes another dip to around 8k maybe I'll try again?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:09:24
Is mining still a thing for the average joe?
