I understand your point view, but to play devil's advocate, why is the US required to lift sanctions? The US has every right to put sanctions on countries when they believe it is in their best interest.

Yes, the proof that they exist is written on the blockchain.
You cannot however use or spend those coins unless you have the private address.

Here's the bonehead transaction.
Now I'm so much further away from the 21 million club.
@_date: 2018-10-21 22:15:15
It was a private transaction not a vendor.  I can hope he will refund but that is all.

Keep selling please, I want more!!

There is definitely a correlation, but you have to remember, most of the S9s were delivered as the crypto market was crashing. And once you have purchased a miner, that initial investment makes it much more economical to mine.

My only concern is how many bitcoin whales there currently are, I can certainly see them leveraging their stockpiles of BTC to increase their positions even further. 
I don't deal with futures anyway, but I would be very hesitant to bet for or against bitcoin the first couple months after bitcoin leveraged futures are released.
I believe we should all be aware that whatever manipulation can be done in other markets is likely easier with bitcoin as it is possible to have greater control on anonymity.
TLDR: HODL, don't start getting greedy folks. You have control over your own BTC, don't bet it away.

Because big movement of funds tends to cascade into other people moving funds the same way.  So someone sells 100 million, other people freak out and sell their bitcoin too, expecting the whale to sell even more.
Then, while everyone else is forcing the price down by following the dip, the whale buys back slowly and eventually has more bitcoin than he started with.
Basically people are dumb and sale low.

No problem, it was on Robinhood (I don't think they actually hold Bitcoin).  I made $1400 yesterday selling ATVI calls, so losing $500 on bitcoin when I know it will be up again in a few days is no problem.

I would check other subreddits, you are getting no help here.  Wish I had real advice to give.
@_date: 2019-08-28 20:25:38
I'm using robinhood.  And the percent is in the negatives, that is all I would like to admit haha.

Interestingly with the December 15 date, 2 years may be a loss, it has to rally really hard for that not to be the case.
I get your point and I'm not at all worried, just an observation.

Nah Satoshi will wait awhile before selling.

I'm a mix between a hodler and your typical autistic wallstreetbets member.
I have a long term position in bitcoin that I refuse to touch for 2 more years, and then I have my lets fuck with the market wallstreet/bitcoin fund.
HODL so far is winning out, by a lot.

Looks like a whale sold a bunch. A big buy wall got ate up.
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:17:35
I literally bought 3 minutes ago HAHAHA.

In 2011 (I think, I remember the price was $6, so whenever that was) I almost bought two GPUs to mine from a coworker I was into. She explained bitcoin and I thought it sounded really cool. I didn't think revolutionary, but just cool, something nerds would use and nothing more. Mostly I was super attracted to this girl who was into cryptography and computers, who could explain to me, albeit over my head, why I wanted to use a GPU and not a CPU to mine. Then she started dating another guy and I just forgot about it.
Obviously I regret not getting in at that point. On a side note, she still seems to be working a regular 9-5, so I don't think she was a HODLer.
