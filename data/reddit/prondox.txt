I think your brother was just really bad at dealing with emotions/disapointment/something bad happening. When something even moderately bad happens to me my first thought is: "im never going to overcome this/im screwed/I might aswell just end it. This all stems from low selfesteem. Don't beat yourself up over it, nothing you could have done, once you are so far down the rabbit hole of the depression there is no way back unless het person wants it.

I imagine the price Climbing back to be around 10-15% off his target in the next 2 weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:19:15
Im expecting a drop to around 6-7k by the end of the year

Gates is only picking up steam the longer he does things. Expecting him to do a insane amount of great things for the world population in the next 20-30 years.

Oh yea because people without education and without a reliable source of information will be able to set up safe ways of managing their cryptos and not have them stolen.

We all like and believe in blockchain but sucking block chains dick this hard is just crazy
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:23:19
I forgot about it for a while then noticed it was over 1500 so I was like yea lets see where this goes, being able to go for 250K now is really tempting but what if i can make even more money, double it or tripple or even more!!!!!!!! the greed is real, two voices are permanently in my head saying either man sell that shit and do away with the stress and the risk and the other one telling me to ride it out to 40k
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:58:53
Im getting more and more scared, I bought 25 bitcoins when they were 200 each, anyone wanna give me advice on when to sell? I hope to wait for 40k so i can sell for a full mil

You are complaining about memes on the internet?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:52:46
200k isn't life changing for me, it would be nice but it would not change my life much so I think ill just ride it out
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:24:28
You could say that about any point in the bitcoin history, OMG YOU ARE HOLDING ONTO 10K BITCOINS DONT RISK IT

If he wanst convicted for them he is not guilty. He wansn't even charged so for agument sake you have to assume he is not guilty.
@_date: 2018-03-27 07:28:23
He ran a huge drug distribution network. Yes he advocated safe drug use and all that but you guys realise he ran a drug net work? These charged coupled with the child porn stuff should have netted him like 20 years. Double life sentence is kinda insane.

Not really, if you are HODL don't move it at all tbh.

Can u give me a ELI5 of how to pay with bitcoin and what app to use. On the one hand I want to "invest in it" like half a bitcoin but can't be bothered to buy a ledger. I just want to use it to pay with so like 50 bucks on it or something. 
What app should I use / how to pay / where to buy?
@_date: 2018-04-10 13:36:48
We can laugh at those that were sceptic or straight up pessimistic but don't pretend anyone could have predicted Bitcoin ever hitting this high. Bitcoin and stocks are just gambles and bitcoin just did really well.

He says taxes are theft, you life in a country and have to abide it's laws. The government claiming a part of your money isn't "claiming ownership of something that doesn't belong to you"

Ah so you don't like roads do you? Who is gonna pay for roads / public services if no one pays tax?
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:21:26
Yes slave labour and taxes are the same issue
@_date: 2018-04-11 13:53:33
This actually describes this sub pretty well. On the one hand we want bitcoin / cryptos to become a mainstream way to pay for goods and services but we don't want to spend them because we are afraid we will lose out on gains. At one point will the hodlers be satisfied with the price and start using them as currencies?
@_date: 2018-04-23 13:19:05
Thank you for the information :) you use the greenbit wallet to pay but you can also just pay with the coinbase one right?
