Hey bigshig79,
take a look into the sidebar.
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:17:29
Check the sidebar lots of useful information in there.

Current exchange rate is 266 GBP. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 21:31:06
At what exchange rate and where did you bought the bitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-12-25 13:15:40
That should be no problem. Get a hoster and put Wordpress on it. There are many options for creating a store and add Bitcoin as a payment method. PM me if you have questions.
@_date: 2015-11-07 23:13:06
Yeah, no informations = no passwort.
@_date: 2015-11-15 21:23:30
I see. Thanks for you feedback. :)

China is asleep right now. Maybe they can start the next day a bit more furious.
@_date: 2015-11-14 22:46:13
I was like wtf.
Anyone explain pls.
@_date: 2015-11-21 14:19:56
If I am right, bitcoin.de takes only 0,05%
@_date: 2015-11-16 06:06:35
Unlikely. Because it is actually a W7 key which can be upgraded to Win10. I didn't made that clear so I removed the products temporarily. 
But when thats back up it will be 100% safe. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 22:31:46
@_date: 2015-11-04 22:30:11
I would atleast wait till China is awake. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 06:02:33
Absolutely right. Fixed. :)
