So now it's India again?

And let's just ignore the other side of paying with Bitcoin where you don't get refunded and have no way to get your money back. 
Let me guess. This suddenly is not a feature of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-06-13 19:57:06
How you can post this without any sense of irony is beyond me. Really amazing. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 20:42:56
Could you be any more childish because they've dropped the Bitcoin option? Man, seriously. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 20:24:26
Affected. 
Crazy how nobody on this planet can spell this word correctly. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 08:33:15
How many more scams are you gonna fall for?
You seem so surprised that all these cloud mining and ponzi sites are scams. Which is kinda strange because everything about them screams scam. 
I have the feeling you are terribly naive and fall for anything that offers you free money. Maybe that is the problem. 
And the fact that you're waiting for support and think they will still pay kinda confirms that. 
Stop putting your money in this shit and you can stop making posts here how you got scammed. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 15:29:29
they should switch to Bitcoin!
And lose 99.9% of potentially paying people. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 17:05:37
Wait, i thought "they" were fighting us. 
Please make up your mind. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 14:51:53
Yes obviously. Bitcoin is doing amaaaaazing and the price is about to go x10. Because reasons. Buy buy buy! You will get riiiiiiich!!1
@_date: 2015-06-11 23:11:24
You and 200 people before you who posted the same thing. Get over it. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 16:05:12


You forgot the part where it's highly likely the world won't switch to Bitcoin. 
But yeah, tiny detail, i know. Might as well ignore it. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 15:10:07
What rally??
Hilarious how i'm downvoted because clearly there's a big rally going on, right?
@_date: 2015-06-12 08:39:42
Well, there is the answer:
May i suggest you keep your money in your pockets from now because you obviously have no idea what you're doing and people like you ALWAYS end up losing all their money. 
But i know you won't listen anyway and will send money to the next ponzi you'll bump into. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 16:15:18
So when the msm mentions drugs + Bitcoin this sub goes nuts. But a movie that does this is suddenly good for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-06-12 08:36:19
You "invested" 1 dollar?
@_date: 2015-06-11 15:59:05
@_date: 2015-06-13 17:08:29
And another quality thread. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 12:44:24
Step away from the keyboard and take your meds. 
@_date: 2015-06-11 23:21:48
Go ahead! Or are you just the ideas guy?
@_date: 2015-06-13 12:58:00
I always have this when i use my cc. Absolutely mind blowing. 
@_date: 2015-06-13 18:19:32
Just like any other way people obtain money. 
Stealing, working, begging, selling products and so on. You couldn't figure any of this out yourself?
@_date: 2015-06-11 15:57:15
And what then exactly?
I seriously got downvoted for asking what will happen? This place is insane. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 13:16:57
That was my first thought as well but that would be so ridiculous that i doubt he was aiming at that. 
We'll wait for his answer...
Edit. Just downvotes, no answers. Surprising. 
@_date: 2015-06-13 17:59:28
Well, not to me. They work great, fast, i'm insured and can do chargebacks. Plus, you know, they're accepted world wide. No reason to use anything else. 
@_date: 2015-06-13 18:50:51
Only a complete idiot would fall for this. Warning those kind of people will have no effect whatsoever. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 08:41:49
You totally missed my point. You are extremely naive. How old are you?
@_date: 2015-06-13 13:24:39
You guys really thought him a lesson by buying all his coins!
@_date: 2015-06-13 19:47:06
Right! Who gives a shit about the price! Obviously nobody here. We all know Bitcoiners don't buy coins in hopes to get rich without working. No such thing! Upvote this man!
@_date: 2015-06-15 12:49:18
You forgot to mention what this has to do with Bitcoin. As the op's always do with these kind of posts. Really odd behavior. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 15:44:24
Huh what?
@_date: 2015-06-12 08:34:03
Completely irrelevant.
