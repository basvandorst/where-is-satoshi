Actually...   For those who don't want to trust an exchange, yes, I do many payments per day in/out of LBC (automatically, via a bot, but still have to forgo some profit when transfers get too slow).

I will offer 8% of the [funds stolen from me](   It's conditional on me getting back 100% of the funds.
I cannot offer any reimbursement for not-my-funds.

Nobody sane would ever bid in this auction...
They've set up an [all-pay auction]( which is an odd, but legitimate way to sell things.  An all-pay auction doesn't work if all bidders can't independently verify the identity of the top bidder though.
Imagine this:
* Person A has some secret files to sell.
* Person B bids $10
* Person C bids $50
* Person D bids $60
Person A can now give the item to person D and take their profit of $120 (remember it's "all pay").
Alternatively, they could pretend to be a buyer and bid $100, then walk away with a profit of $120, not have to give their secrets to anyone, and nobody would even be able to tell the auction wasn't legitimate.
For this to work, they are going to need to use a winner-pays only auction.

Agreed - the haircut on non-affected currencies implies they are able to convert one to another easily, immediately, and at a known price.
If they have already executed these trades, where did they do them?   If they have not already executed these trades, how can they be sure such a trade is even possible - any currency value could change anytime without notice.

How many passwords do you need to test?
If you're talking "one of the 25 passwords I've ever used", then simply try them all by hand.
If you're talking "I remember is was XcookieXXX, where XXXX were 4 random digits", then write or find a script to test it as others have suggested.  If you know the public key of the correct wallet, you should be able to do it all offline, meaning even if the script were malicious, it wouldn't be able to steal anything.
If you're thinking "I have no idea what the password was, I think it was 15 random digits", then I'm afraid no password cracker will find it.  There are too many possibilities to try.

The lightning network theoretically supports many kinds of coins.

If there are 50 different client implementations, the risk becomes that due to some ambiguity in the spec, it is possible to craft a transaction accepted by 60% of the network, which then gets mined and causes a fork which won't resolve until the 40% who don't accept it upgrade.

FBI finds site the software is distributed through and makes a modified version which looks the same but secretly reports everything back to FBI servers.
Then they wait a bit and go arrest all the users, with a nice evidence database collected by their dodgy software.

If bitcoin is to become mainstream, it will need 1 second processing for the median transaction.   For transactions of a value less than the block mining reward, propagating the change to the majority of miners should be sufficient to have a high confidence, and that can be done in one worldwide round trip, or about 150ms.
Card systems vary around the world, but contactless credit cards in Europe currently take less than a second in most cases.

That should theoretically be safe.
His one line of safety was TOR.   The fact that investigators wouldn't be able to find the server, since it's a TOR hidden service.
He could connect to the server or hosting company etc. fine without tor, and still remain anonymous.  The server would be linked to him, and vice-versa, but neither would be linked to the SR 2.0 onion address.
The court filing doesn't specify how the FBI found the server in the first place.  Thats probably the bit they used their NSA exploits in TOR for and don't want to talk about in TOR filings...

I imagine they have to be able to show the source of the money for tax purposes, for example.

How about paying for the subway/metro?   Are you going to wait 15 seconds for the gate to open?
Or paying for a toll bridge/road?   Are you going to slow down and stop for 15 seconds, or would you like a payment system you can drive through at 60mph?
There are lots of uses for fast payment systems.   The faster a payment system is, the more uses it will have.

The success of something like this is 1% the idea, and 99% the ability to make it happen.
If you have that ability, go and make it happen.

Where would said tree be stored?
If you publish the entire tree, then unless your account id's are cryptographically secure, anybody can see anybody elses balance.  You could make some lookup server that only gives you the bits of the tree needed to prove your leaf of the tree (and only give you those with login credentials), but a user still needs third party verification they have got the same root as everyone else.
Is this a one-time proof, or could it be extended for continuous proof (ie. at any point in time)?

Google bills you afterwards for ads.  It doesn't have a "balance" like paypal.

It's open source...    Patches welcome to improve the user experience.   Just make sure whatever you propose doesn't allow the user to easily accidentally re-enable a bad extension, since it's amazing how a persuasive extension author can easily say "It's a false positive, re-enable my app anyway!", leading the user to re-expose themselves to badware.
And badware can be very bad - running it for just 1 second is enough to steal auth cookies for banking websites, bitcoins, email logins and passwords etc.

We don't actually know how many BTC they would need to cover all their customers deposits.   There is no easy way they can prove that.

Changed query, chart, and numbers to reflect that...   It now *doesn't* take dust inco account, and correctly tracks transactions not addresses.
@_date: 2019-06-29 17:27:05
For those interested, this is the query which generated the data:
    
    SELECT
      last_touched,
      SUM(tot_value)
    FROM (
      SELECT
        MAX(day) AS last_touched,
        SUM(value) AS tot_value
      FROM (
        SELECT
          TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(block_timestamp, DAY) AS day,
          -inp.value AS value,
          inp.spent_output_index AS tx_index,
          inp.spent_transaction_hash AS tx_hash
        FROM
          `bigquery-public-data.crypto_bitcoin.transactions` AS x,
          UNNEST(inputs) AS inp
        UNION ALL
        SELECT
          TIMESTAMP_TRUNC(block_timestamp, DAY) AS day,
          outp.value AS value,
          outp.index AS tx_index,
          `hash` AS tx_hash
        FROM
          `bigquery-public-data.crypto_bitcoin.transactions` AS x,
          UNNEST(outputs) AS outp)
      GROUP BY
        tx_index,
        tx_hash )
    GROUP BY
      last_touched
    ORDER BY
      last_touched;
    
Run it on Google Bigquery (it fits in the free usage allowance, but only just, so you probably want to save the results rather than re-running it 50 times)

Note that the two large steps, on 21st March 2019 (5.1M bitcoins) and 18th Jun 2019 (1.8M bitcoins), suggests that a single person or entity controls balances that large, which makes them much bigger than bitfinex (100k bitcoins).
Anyone know who they are?

I tried that, but the Google query took 3 hours before I gave up waiting...   Have to query it some other way...

Eg. Someone creating a "bitcoin bank" which pays interest on deposits, and then loans out those bitcoin to others (while charging interest).
This type of lending with no fractional reserve requirement increases the number of apparent bitcoin in circulation, since person A says "I have 0.1 bitcoin.  They're in my bank account.", yet person B says "I have 0.1 bitcoin, since I just took out a loan and they're safe in my bank", and person C says "I have 0.1 bitcoin, since I just took out a loan and they're safe in my bank", etc.
Person A, B, and C are referring to the exact same bitcoin, yet everyone thinks they "have" 0.1 bitcoin.

The difference isn't as big as you make out.
Trackers and futures markets significantly affect supply too.  There are people who will capitalize on any difference between the futures market and the actual market by buying one and selling the other to make a guaranteed profit.

Any user who wants to keep coins longer than this merely needs to make *any* transaction involving them, and they will get refreshed for a further 4 years.   That doesn't seem too burdensome to eliminate a risk to the entire ecosystem.

Make two transactions:
* One from Address A -&gt; B
* One from Address A -&gt; C
Transmit one on each network.
As soon as *both* get a few confirmations, you can now spend from B or spend from C, knowing your transactions can only occur on one chain.
