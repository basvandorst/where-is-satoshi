Very cool! Good for him. I make a living off fiat too .. as does probably 99% of the others in this sub. But that's not to say I (or others) don't believe in BTC. :)

Ahhhh yes..... wires. So fun.

Kind of up to the bank and how they handle forced closed accounts. I'd ask!
EDIT: Was just thinking to myself.. if you have a good relationship I'd request some kind of phone number or dept to contact (like risk dept?) so you can talk to someone to figure out why they closed it. Most all banks have that area they direct clients to.

Where can I buy one of these stamps.... I will go thru the cash at the bank I work at and start stamping away

Wouldn't matter if you asked the person/manager there in the bank about it. Everything is monitored in back office and decisions are made outside of the staffs control in retail banks.

I have a membership with this gym. No lie.

Thank you for posting this OP. A lot of people don't realize this point that you made. I had a debate not too long ago about BTC and USD... this is something I failed to mention as it slipped my mind.

I mean.... they're spending money they don't have.

They're incompetent of running a successful exchange IMO. They have gotten too big for their own good.

From my perspective and what we all witnessed inside the branch it was very shady. 
Also, I'm not sure how well it'd be received from the client to get a letter asking for proof of where all this cash comes from. Doc's could likely be forged (if something illegal is going on), then they have to be validated, proven, opens up for legal action to be taken from the client (another headache) ... The idea sounds good pretty good but logistically would be a operational nightmare. It's easier for them to just say, "Bye Felicia."

I thought there was direct wiring instructions when you're in GDAX and you click on deposit. I could be wrong. I wouldn't know because I closed my Coinbase account back in December. They're a joke.
From a bank perspective (not that I agree with it just wanted to shed some light on it all) they are always protecting themselves from any potential risk. Compliance is such a huge factor and they don't wanna get fined for anything. 
We had a business client for 4-5yrs that about twice a week would come in and make their deposits... all in cash. Regularly. Lots of it. So after a few years the bank noticed this and started monitoring it. They found that the amount of cash wasn't in line for the type of business. Is it illegal to deposit a lot of cash for a business on the reg? Nope. But the bank says yes or no if they want to do business with you. She came in one day with a letter saying they were going to close her accounts in 2 weeks so she needed to take appropriate action.

Bitstamp does not support ACH transfers at the moment. Thats kind of expensive to get fiat in for US traders.

Hey OP! Sorry to hear they closed your account. I work for one of the largest financial institutions in the US as a relationship manager (personal banker) and I come across risk, force closed accounts weekly. Clients come in very upset. 90% of the time it's obvious why it happened. Fraud and such is the most common. 
Personal accounts and business accounts are looked at differently and follow different rule sets. Banks are always constantly playing the game of "cover our asses." One huge red flag is a business account making "personal" transactions. Because Coinbase is a personal money service (not designed for business or institutional use, that's what gdax is for) they probably had no choice. On top of that it's bitcoin, digital assets, risk, fines, shit! That's all they think.
Banking in the current form is so hilarious and broken. Yes I work in the field but I see the flaws daily. Don't even get me started on wire transfers...
Anyways, sorry to hear about it again. I'd recommend you use your personal accounts for Bitcoin transactions or check out local bitcoin. Good luck!

No I have not. Can you share an example? I am only aware of them buying / selling coins on their platform. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:11:36
I am assuming the answer already but .. When you asked your bank about the wire and if it made it to the beneficiary what did they say?
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:50:27
What part is not true? Bitstamp not supporting ACH? Or that wire transfers are not expensive?
ACH transfers are much cheaper then wires across the board for all US banks. Much much cheaper then $50.

So you pay taxes with your bitcoin and create another taxable event to pay the taxes...
Sounds cool on the surface but completely not viable.
