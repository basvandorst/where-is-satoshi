BitPay actually falls into an exemption in the money services business rule because they're a payment processor for merchants who are selling goods and services. Whereas BitInstant had to register and follow the AML regulations because they were straight up exchanging USD for BTC. It's weird. The two things the feds care about are 'exchanging' and 'transmission' but BitPay also doesn't 'transmit' by their definition outside of its activities as a payment processor, because it doesn't allow person to person transfers.

Money launderers aren't really, not yet. The people that launder money for the drug cartels are handling millions and millions of dollars and BTC is too volatile and still too small for them to hide in. At the moment the drug dealers who are getting paid in BTC are still trying to convert it back into hard currency. 
Bitcoin's real advantage in terms of money laundering is size, cash is bulky, you can't hide a million dollars in cash in a thumb drive. Bitcoin can also be transferred across international borders very quickly, which makes it slow for the police to catch up. Ordinarily transactions that are suspicious or are over 10k get reported to the authorities, but that's not a problem with bitcoin.
Bitcoin doesn't take care of the money laundering for you, but it does make some of the steps easier.
It would work something like this:
* Guy has a bunch of bitcoins
* Guy puts his BTC in a tumbler and gets 'fresh' BTC
* Guy creates his story for why he has a bunch of money: "I run a restaurant that accepts BTC" or 
"I do web design over the internet for BTC"
* Guy creates a trail of fake transactions that fit his story
* Guy buys new Lamborghini

I know, the only reason I could think of that the FBI would want LR's source code would be to try to de-anonymize the transactions. That seems to be their MO looking at Lavabit, to a certain degree Silk Road, and this.

A step in the right direction, even if it's for a bad reason, is still a step in the right direction. I'd like to imagine that one day, corrupt politicians will have nowhere to spend their dirty cash.
The leaders who are trying to keep Afghanistan open for business for money launderers are holding people like Mr. Fuad hostage hoping that the international community won't take strong action.
@_date: 2014-06-06 00:52:25
The issue is that it's the people who are opposed to the laws threatening to create the collateral damage, they're holding the honest people like Mr Fuad hostage. This isn't very different from "If you send in the cops, I'll shoot".

I agree, as long as you aren't breaking the law. I don't know why they refused the deposit, they could have been just being dicks. If you had documentation about the source of funds, and weren't being super-sketchy, then it would have just meant extra paperwork for them.
@_date: 2014-01-27 18:28:14
Yes, what Faiella was accused of doing in the complaint is buying their BTC and paying them in cash. Then he would sell those BTC to Shrem for cash.
@_date: 2014-02-03 22:16:19
I don't really see it as much different than selling anything else that could easily be used to harm people. If you're selling guns, morally and legally, you should be as sure as you can that those people aren't criminals.  
It's different from spying, because their concern is binary "Does this money laundering?" and only if the answer is "yes" does anything happen. If the system was being used to report political donations or to spy on activists, I would be very upset, but if (how) they do that is not this way.
Even if we don't count drugs. Just by virtue of the fact that the vast majority of people aren't criminals, the vast majority of AML/KYC won't have anything to report, that doesn't mean we should get rid of it though.

He could be using the account as a pass through, or operating a hawala. Money laundering can occur in essentially any financial transaction, the questions they asked OP seemed pretty routine.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:41:28
The "anywhere in the ATM network" aspect opens up a whole can of worms in regards to AML regulations. There are a bunch of rules about cross-border money transmission which would make this difficult to do internationally. ATM networks in general run squarely into a bunch of AML regs they need to comply with.
@_date: 2014-06-05 21:39:06
Afghanistan's problem isn't technical, so why would the solution be technical? This has been coming for years, and it's easily avoidable. The point is that their leaders don't give a damn about the honest people they hurt.
The heroin that's produced by Afghanistan's poppy crops also hurts a lot of honest people. Money laundering laws aren't automatically evil, I think this would improve the situation.

Charlie Shrem is not going to jail because he's a Bitcoiner, he's going to jail because he's a money launderer.
[I absolutley **loathe** Matt Taibbi (and anyone else who throws horse semen into someone's face) who is quoted ostensibly as an authority throughout this piece](  
You don't need to face criminal charges or anything else to have your banking license revoked, and if your regulators want to see your books and records they don't even need a warrant. Every time someone mentions money laundering on reddit, crowds of people show up and go "hurr hurr HSBC". Yes, fuck them, but the conclusion from that shouldn't be "money laundering is fine".  


Anonymous transactions are legal; being a mexican narco-gang is not legal, banking a mexican narco-gang is not legal. 


Maybe let's be careful before we listen to someone who 60 minutes "presented as a representation of misinformation found online." He's simply wrong, that's not an accurate statement. 


Driving someone to and from the liquor store is victimless; driving someone to and from *robbing* the liquor store is not victimless. Providing banking services is victimless; providing banking services to someone who you know is a criminal is not victimless. Damn right it's not really accurate, because the author purposely misconstrued it to be "not really accurate". Fraud and other non-violent crimes need their money laundered too.
Sometimes I cannot understand the people on reddit.

Are there gangs you *do* have a problem with? Corrupt politicians have to launder their money too, for example.

haha, no I posted this here because of the new information about the FBI approaching him to get Liberty Reserve's source code. I think this is useful here because it illuminates the reasoning and approach that the Feds take, which would also be applicable to BTC (especially because the decisions about regulation are being made right now). 
but I am actually mod of though
@_date: 2014-01-29 20:53:23
and one important extra thing, structuring transactions to avoid reporting requirements is illegal no matter what.
@_date: 2014-02-03 22:36:14
This is absolutely not that argument. This is the argument that before you go into business as a financial institution you have to agree to take reasonable steps to ensure that your services won't be abused to launder money. That AML/KYC is part of upholding that agreement. That, morally you shouldn't want to help money launderers anyway. That, while I am concerned about spying, this system is not being used to spy. And that, if you think drugs should be legal then fighting to legalize drugs would be better than legalizing money laundering.
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:39:17
 "It depends", as a general rule under federal law (US) you're ok if you're providing real goods and services for bitcoin. You need to be careful to stay away from doing anything that could be 'transmission' (so don't deliver the gold to anyone other than the person who paid for it). Additionally if you're going to be selling large dollar amounts of gold, there's more regulations you need to look into. If you're interested about money laundering more generally, come check out @_date: 2014-01-07 21:03:06
It'll definitely be interesting to see what the laws about bitcoin end up being.
It's pretty difficult to do bank things anywhere in the world and not involve the US at some point, that's why our bank laws have such a broad reach.
The AML laws apply to exchanges, not users; but with things like bitcoin it's easy to be both (at least by the technical definition) and be fairly undetectable.
Over at they're still trying to convert bitcoin into cash, if they stop worrying about that then we're in trouble.

Interestingly enough Preet Bahara was giving a lecture this morning about AML compliance at the ACAMS NYC conference

Your sister sounds like a smart lady, she gives you a shout out on the first page at least. (First bearer bonds, then gold, I hope your family isn't planning a BTC heist next!) Hello from anyway!
She's right that Bitcoin exchanges will have to comply with the US Anti-Money Laundering laws but only if they have a nexus with the US. The Bank Secrecy Act only applies when you have some connection with the US, not worldwide to everyone.
It's important to keep in mind that you can't really do anything with bitcoin that you can't do already with cash. Bitcoins distinct advantage over cash is that they make placement easier. Placement is when money launderers have to get their physical cash into the financial system (essentially turning it from paper into electricity). Cash is inconvenient, it's bulky and it's heavy, and you have to be somewhere physically to spend it. Plus nobody does large transactions in cash; even when you're investing in foreign cash you don't actually handle it anymore. With btc you effectively get to skip that step, and that's something but it's definitely not money laundering's answer to sliced bread.
The regulations have some lead time on this because right now the btc market is too small and too volatile for the really big bad guys to bother with. If you have any questions, feel free to ask!
@_date: 2014-01-27 22:41:39
hmm, TigerDirect is a retailer so they're not really covered by the same regulations as BitInstant was but if they were suspicious enough to report it I guess they'd try and find out who you were.
This guy knew exactly what he had to do though, his other business title was Chief Compliance Officer, he just ignored it. He's screwed, they're going to crucify him.
With the way the financial system works, essentially anyone who wants to do business has to comply with US laws. This is because they only need one "nexus" to get jurisdiction so if you want to do anything even remotely connected with the US it applies.
@_date: 2014-06-06 16:34:50
That would take away the influence of the people trying to fight money laundering as well. We need to find a way to improve the technical solution then.
If they don't pass anti-money laundering laws then not putting Afghanistan on the black list (of countries that don't have anti-money laundering laws) would encourage other countries to follow that path.
I'm not saying that Afghanistan doesn't need Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-27 19:53:09
If you wanted to, like Mr Shrem, you could decide not to follow the rules of the big mean government thugs; but like Mr Shrem they'd put you in prison. Maybe I should have titled it "What the BitInstant arrest shows about how Bitcoin will be purchased in the future for people who don't like prison".
@_date: 2014-01-07 05:03:12
This is a poor reason for why we need bitcoin. It's definitely their business where the money comes from, and it's also the law. Did the guy in the original thread have any supporting documents? Loans don't often get paid back in a lump sum in cash. There's no laws against accepting large cash deposits but you've gotta know its source. No offense to OP but £8000 in cash with a "My Father in Law is paying back a loan" and nothing else wouldn't have made me feel comfortable with the deposit.
The worst thing someone could do in that situation is to break it down into multiple deposits because, even if you got the cash legally, structuring deposits to avoid reporting requirements is illegal.

The people who freeze your account and take it are the government, and separate accounts aren't going to stop them. Banks don't really do that, the meanest thing a bank will do is close your account and give you your money back. A separate account might be easier to keep account of though.
@_date: 2014-01-29 23:30:37
Yeah I was more pointing it out for after tumbling. US AML/CFT laws apply to all US persons and transactions settled in USD anywhere in the world.
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:55:57
Yes, I was specifically talking about the extra rules that apply once you start doing business internationally. Compliance takes resources, and many people within the bitcoin community don't like the idea of being regulated, eventually there'll be a clear set of rules though and we can help make them.
@_date: 2014-01-23 00:00:34
State laws are more complicated than federal, and harder to boil down for people to easily understand (there are 50 different sets of them). Right now the way that the federal rules are, essentially:
* If you are using BTC to buy and sell **real** good and services you are fine
* If you are mining BTC and using them to buy things / pay expenses **or** converting them to fiat you are fine
* You are not fine if you are exchanging BTC for fiat **or** if you are "transmitting" them, for this you need to register and do some paperwork.
@_date: 2014-06-06 20:37:21
It's a perfectly acceptable for a country to say "I don't want my citizens to do business with narcotics traffickers" and then make a law to that effect. 
Essentially the FATF member countries are saying "You can't transact with our businesses unless you put strong anti-money laundering laws in place" and Afghanistan is saying "Look at how many people would be hurt if they couldn't transact with your businesses, also we're not going to do that".
You can look at banking like a product, like beef or minerals. Having standards about how that product is created is normal. If the EU wants to say "You can't import beef to here if you've pumped it full of hormones" or the US says "You can't sell your minerals here if they're being used to fund warlords" that's something they have the right to do, and in some cases the moral responsibility. People deserve the freedom "not to" just as much as deserve just as much as the freedom "to".
It would be great if only the money launderers could be effected. The system can always be made better, but it's up to us to make it that way.
@_date: 2014-01-30 21:27:17
I can't speak to regulations outside the US, but it seems like your best course of action is to show them that you have a rock solid anti-money laundering program. Show them how someone who tries to launder money through your service will get shut down.
Saying 'all technologies support money laundering', while it might be accurate, probably won't be the most productive line of dialog. Creating a bulletproof compliance program doesn't necessarily take a lot of resources, isn't overly difficult, and pays for itself in the long run. Realize that you're going to be under a microscope, so take it as an opportunity to win them over.
@_date: 2013-12-14 20:57:39
Here are some of the regulations I was talking about.

Hello from !
Your post didn't mention how much money you were talking about, but I'm guessing it wasn't above any serious reporting thresholds. The unfortunate answer is that whoever you talked to at Ebay was a little bit mistaken. The problem is the way these transactions are treated under the current regulations. "Technically speaking" you're in a grey area because the primary purpose of selling Casascius coins is transmitting Bitcoin, which makes you a money transmitter subject to the regulations on money transmitters instead of a plain user.
If you were planning to sell enough of them, you could register and it would be pretty easy to comply with those regs, but it probably won't make sense to do it on a small scale.
In terms of what you can expect from Paypal compliance over this, the worst thing they can do is close your account and give you your money back. Signing the affadavit is not really a big deal, I'd do it, it's mainly an ass-covering maneuver on their part.
If you have any more questions I'd be happy to help.
