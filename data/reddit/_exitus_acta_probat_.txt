No it isn't. ASIC's designed for SHA256 Bitcoin mining were not even invented/coded-for when Bitcoin was first mined using it. Bitcoin was first mined with CPU's.


In other words... competition.
Just because you failed to compete effectively does not mean that the playing field is not level... because it is a level playing field. You have the same opportunity to go educate yourself and collect funding, then manufacture or buy machines to mine with to compete on the playing field of merit.

Isn't competition the very best method of doing business?
Do you believe that competition should now be shelved and governance should mandate artificial controls?

It's reality, dude. 
55% of first, 67% of second, and 74% of third marriages end in divorce, and more than 7 out of 10 of *all* divorces are filed by the woman. Most end in psychological devastation and often financial ruin for men when a mans wealth is redistributed to the woman, she empties the bank accounts, sells the valuables, maxes out the credit cards and stops paying the mortgage after she falsely accuses the man to get him kicked out of the house to set a child custody precedent a judge will almost never reverse... add to that she takes his kids away from him and she gets at least half of everything left over that he worked all his life to obtain.

They're probaby trying to prevent being fined for money laundering by using Coinbase. Coinbase has robust AML/KYC and checks coin address chains for "bad coins." By using Coinbase they pass on that liability to Coinbase and show some due dilligence.

They don't need to prove it, although that certainly helps a lot. All they need to do is make a divorce judge believe that a spouse is being dishonest on the Disclosure of Assets. A Family Court judge can impute (guess and assign) assets accordingly and award her an equitable distribution of marital assets based on that imputed value that will probably be much higher that the actual value of the assets he's hiding. Of course he can appeal, but it is extremely rare for an appellate court to overturn a judges decision in a divorce.
That said, if he's been into Bitcoin for years, there are all kinds of witnesses that could be called to testify and seizing the logs of phone and internet accounts would be trivial. From those logs they will know what websites he visited and was a member of, then serve those website service providers with court orders for the server logs, which may include Bitcoin mining, exchanges, forums, social media, etc. The logs from the phone and internet ISP may even show mining and/or Bitcoin transactions. Additionally, financial transactions involving Bitcoin can be followed through financial institutions. Simply follow the money. 
Of course, if the wife never knew about her husbands interest in Bitcoin and he wiped his tracks from his devices and kept wallets obfuscated and encrypted, then there would be no traces of trails left over to spur further expensive and time consuming investigations mentioned above.

Not in my opinion. I recommend simply sitting on your coins on both chains and hodl to see how it all pans out. There might even be a third chain as well that you should sit on in a few months. It's way better than making the wrong guess and selling off one chain that could later be worth a lot more than the other.


Yes, it is *possible*, but the prices for the bitcoin in every chain added up reflect the total amount of money in Bitcoin, so if you hold existing coins you ~~will~~ may be in a much better position than getting rid on any now. It's safer than guessing. I say gessing because both chains have their good and bad points.
That said, when buying *new* coins, I believe that buying on both chains a coin amount commensurate to their value at the time of purchase to be the proper move to be on the safe side. Currently that is a little less than 8:1 in favor of Bitcoin Core. As the prices change you can also change your coin holdings to commensurate levels on each chain.

Illicit and illegal drugs are a plague on our society that steals the hopes, dreams and futures from our neighbors, friends and family, and increases our taxes because of the fallout of addiction with the expenses of social services, law enforcement and the criminal justice and prison systems. Also, petty crime increases exponentially as addiction rises so they can fuel their addictions, [**EDIT:** although I will admit that it appears that *some* violent crimes related to drug-dealing have decreased that may correspond to online darknet drug sales].

In July of 2007 during the run-up to the 2008 derivatives market crash, housing price crash and subsequent government taxpayer-funded bank bailout, Bear-Stearns (major hedge funds) price was tanking badly and Jim Cramer was advising his viewers not to panic and not to take their money out of it. He said that Bear-Stearns was basically safe.
He was wrong.
Cramer has always been a schmuck and will always be a schmuck. Personally, I believe that he may have been directed to support Bear-Stearns by General Electric and/or C/NBC executives. Really doesn't matter. Hack or sellout... who cares. The end result is the same.

If your coins/wallets are not registered in the system, along with your personal information, then the transaction is declined, much like if you attempt to use a stolen or fake credit/debit card/number, and the funds may even be siezed as well.
Then the transaction, coins/wallets, seller and you are targeted for investigation by federal authorities carrying the full weight of the federal government and all their power, force, coercion and authority. Plus, they will sieze all camera footage at the Dunkin Donuts and surrounding businesses near the time of this criminal event. They will get your face, clothing, general description and maybe even your vehicle description and license plate number as well as target any wireless communications from your personal devices.
Within moments your picture and description will appear on trains, buses, cabs, tv's, computers, tablets, watches, phones, advertising kiosks and billboards as a person wanted in connection to cyber terrorism/financial crimes for your crimes against the United States.

Always investigate any business accepting Bitcoin or other crypto. Do some "Legit or Scam" searches, check reviews on many review sites and do a domain name lookup. Never shop at one who has their identity information through a privacy service when looking for places to spend Bitcoin as they are often scams. Also, check out the company and addresses listed in those domain name searches and do a google maps check on the address given for the business... if it's a trailer park, rv park, campground, run-down house or one of those places that rent mailboxes, the odds are not in your favor of getting what you ordered, so buyer beware. Lastly, if the domain name search lists a person, do an online criminal record search of the name and try to match it to an address if at all possible, or any similar info. Some jurisdictions allow you to search for criminal records by name.
Due to the irreversible nature of Bitcoin transactions, your due dilligence is required, else all you're really doing is gambling.

Bitcoin is not failing. Interest, adoption, volume and valuation are near/at all time highs. These are all indicators of success.
There is nothing hostile nor toxic about my above comments. They are honest, factual and direct.
No one forced him to use Bitpay.
No one forced him to pay those fees.
Bitcoin is great for small transactions with low fees, but it was never promised that every 3-party provider would provide a specific and defined low fee for every transaction for every service type. 
**Here's the lesson:** Do not use Bitpay to convert Bitcoin to government-backed currency/credit, or if the fee is too high, do not complete the transaction.
Personal responsibility goes a long way.

This is an inaccurate meme. 
Seasoned hodlers are generally battle-hardened against such reactions to market volatility and down-trends.
Of course they are excited when the price increases and a little sad when the price decreases, but this meme proposes that they are hysterical or otherwise destroyed by corrections and down-trends, which is inaccurate for the overwhelming vast majority of hodlers.
Also, I would argue that most hodlers bought a long time ago and are still *way* up in profits.

No, by my logic no one should advertise that they are into Bitcoin and connect that with a high priced status symbol in public, because a violent criminal may understand that stealing a Bitcoin wallet is the same as stealing cash and may surmise that the guy has a lot of value at his disposal, and that if stolen it probably wont be tracked back to him, much like a large cash ransom of old $20 bills w/o consecutive serial numbers.
