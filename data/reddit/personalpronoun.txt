Not if you bought BTC last December.

If everyone's holding crypto, then what's the point of it? Isn't the point of a currency that you actually buy things with it?

I see the point you're trying to make, but a lot of cards actually have a private key on them that never leaves the card. The card number is given less trust (eg easier to chargeback) vs a transaction where the card proves ownership of the private key.

You don't produce electronics or jewelery, but there are people who do and they use gold to do it. Gold has an intrinsic value for those purposes, so gold will always be valuable for trading in - because someone, somewhere wants it for real life purposes, and they'll be prepared to trade to get it.
Granted there are way too many people valuing gold at way over it's intrinsic value, but that's speculation and not really the point - which is that gold currency *has* an intrinsic value. Fiat currency has a value because a government promises that it'll always accept that currency - which works so long as the population trust that government to keep their promise (i.e. not Zimbabwe or Weimar era Germany).
Bitcoin has a value if two parties trading agree that it has that value. That's it. If you have 1000 btc and everyone agrees that that's worth one mansion, then great - that's what Bitcoin is worth today. On the other hand, if you have 1000 btc and everyone agrees that 1000 btc is worth about as much as a cheeseburger at McDonald's, then that's what Bitcoin is worth. Bitcoin is only worth something while everyone agrees that it's worth something and there's no guarantee - no intrinsic value (gold) or powerful entity (fiat).

From his post:


Did you read it?
What's the "intrinsic value" of a Bitcoin if the person I'm trading it with doesn't accept that it's worth what I claim it is?
