Probably not just as anonymous, but good enough for  the average user. And much much safer to use your own wallet locally, assuming you know how to protect it from attacks.  
TorWallet actually allowed me to pull a small amount of money out of it a few weeks after it was started. The idea of a truly anonymous onion mixing service like bit-instant is appealing, but without a completely trustworthy person/organization running it it is likely it will eventually take all your coins and become unresponsive to communications.  
If you want to do something for the community make sure you review these sites and make the information available before the vast number of users fall for the scams. Otherwise they will continue to perpetuate themselves. TorWallet has been scamming for months (as far as I am aware), so it is probably still raking in enough coins to fund itself many times over, and that is not considering the original scam that probably took a large amount when it was still growing its reputation.  
You probably would want to use a way to trade coins with people you trust to help with anonymity. Just sending the same coins forward to new addresses doesn't really stop a user from seeing where the coins are ending up, but if you trade with others it means someone tracking those coins will start following the wrong coins at the point of the trade. Unfortunately that are not too many good ways to anonymously trade coins securely.
