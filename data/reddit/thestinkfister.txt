Well as I understand it takes a certain financial standing, position with a credible institution or amount spent to be able to make these positionless trades.  I’m not implying people betting on the long are stupid, I am implying that some trades are only available to those of certain financial standing.  
I only said that the financial incentive for the miners and largest holders would be to massively short Bitcoin and then sell at lower than market value to people and ensure their short pays off.  Some will have integrity but many will not. Not all hodlers are bitcoin evangelists or care about the possibilities,
I just don’t see how this is at all good for Bitcoin.  It’s the same thing from the Big Short except Bitcoin is a potentially transformative tool and MBS were worthless packages of mortgages done through predatory lending.  The shirt position far exceeded the

I’ve calmed down now, I’m still uneasy but I realize it’s irrational.

If this was a coordinated Bitcoin dump is anyone concerned that some large holders, even miners -may be holding short positions while wielding the power they have to make sure they pay off?  
I’m concerned again, especially if no one here is.

But people holding a lot of Bitcoins can short massively and drive the price down by selling their bitcoin under market helping to drive the price down.  
People are worried about this at least a little, right?

That and they can short bitcoin without holding it now.

I would just like to say that my first post on this sub was about my concern with Bitcoin futures, trying to find out what the general feeling about it was.  Most were positive regarding this, citing increased mainstream acceptance.  
My concern was short selling.  1-2 days after my post, the Bitcoin crash seemed to be happening.  When it fell under $10k I was shocked, but not as shocked as I was when I saw it back up over $15k.  This is not normal.  
I see wild ups and downs ahead, the war against Bitcoin will be started and something bad enough will happen that will make the US government take action.  
I hope I’m wrong.  But the amount of adoption needed to change the world, take power back, etc... is impossible and things are happening that make the layman even more skeptical.
Also, futures was the straw that broke the tulip markets’ back.

Thanks for the answer.  I have a feeling this is bad but it will take time to see if the incentive for miners and large holders to short outweighs their desire to escape centralized control.  
Do you think this will end up either hurting bitcoin or banks/futures exchanges or mildly bruising both?

Institutional investors (bankers, people with a certain amount of money) can now short Bitcoin without having a position in it.  They don’t need to hold it.  This seems like a disaster waiting to happen because confidence will dwindle, mainstream articles will pop up comparing this to 2009 and many miners and those holding large amounts of bitcoin wil end up massively shorting, then selling Bitcoin at lower prices to drive the market down and ensure their payoff.
