And hopefully we can continue to further improve the communities safety! For now helping others be aware of history’s scar and promote safe investing is highly respectable!

Some learn to juggle them. I call them active investors
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:44:13
Companies would be a more fitting word. I’m not even referring to redditors
@_date: 2018-01-25 22:13:17
Kinda why we got into this crypto business from the get go

Dollar cost averaging 
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:30:21
Elaborate reasons?

Your glass is half empty!

Murphy’s law!

I’m expecting weak hands to end around 7-8k so I’m dollar cost averaging more starting there. People are working on bitcoins utility in everyday life so it’ll retain value
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:46:29
As long as it has utility (usefulness) it will retain value (also looking at Monero retaining utility)
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:38:02
Need a hand?

Just watch Full Metal Alchemist. You will come to know the meaning of equivalent exchange.

Op needs to watch Full Metal Alchemist. Op will come to know the meaning of equivalent exchange.

He said 100k to 70k that was the indicator

Continue to be the light. We cannot expect everyone to see the truth, yet we may set an example. Many fear change, yet fear leads to hate &amp; hate leads to the dark side
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:03:07
This response was so kind. You are the light

I’m gonna hodl until the matrix meme comes true
@_date: 2018-11-12 22:46:43
Realist interpretation here imo
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:35:30
It’s always harder to hodl someone up than push them down. XD
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:07:37
Hodl gang is the real truth

I’m still looking for the proof on the reserves and I’m in. I feel it’ll make an outstanding connection between Fiat and crypto. Do I feel worried about it taking over? NO. I’m pretty sure that is still centralized. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:57:24
I feel like this is generalizing. Or at least maybe I’m hoping
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:53:11
Oh it’s only volatile one way I see now *wink wink*
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:19:19
IM NOT NO KID,CHILD!!!!

Would you bang a pig �� to save the princess �� ?
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:15:02
That’s a fair rebuttal 
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:16:10
Get greedy when everyone is fearful get fearful when everyone is greedy
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:47:23
In what context quantity of people or quantity of fiat?
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:14:31
I mean... I can’t argue with this
@_date: 2018-03-30 15:25:00
 glad you asked :3
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:09:40
So I can buy low 21 club here I come
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:35:04
This doesn’t prove it to be normal behavior. Still generalized just some headliners of 1 person here and there. We got people making incest babies in America, that doesn’t make it “normal behavior”
