Perfect case why UpToken seems to be a good idea!

you most likely also have fork coins on that address  - like bitcoin cash!
be careful with any private keys!

You basically have to change the private key (and so the public key) every 24h hours to avoid a person that scanned the key a day before to just sweep it again. Maybe you could use a brain wallet and add always to the end something e.g. like the first word of the headline of a worldwide newsletts (ny times) to have a randomly changing part of the brain wallet that is know to everyone once the newpaper releases.

The supported coins were BTC, LTC, ETH (sold out) and BCH.

It was in the national currency and i was to lazy to make the conversion. I guess the markup was about the same. Thats the purpose of those ATM in the end.

Well, i think most of those ATMs had the intention to serve the late 2017 rally. Since it takes time to produce them and to find locations they reach the market with quite a delay. Now the market is already saturated and the ATM actually just sit and wait there till the next cicle starts again.
