Good. 
Bitcoin is still very unsafe and risky for the average consumer 
@_date: 2015-06-14 23:58:41
Am I missing something? 21 million coins divided into 8 per coin is not a problem, because those satoshis can have a very large value. 
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:18:27
I'm only 14. I've done small transactions like for 2000 or 5000 us dollars and I asked my bank and they said it's OK. I'm not money laundering. I'm just buying some for someone. Under your point of view. If someone gives me 800$ to buy an iPhone for them IM a criminal. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 22:31:26
I tried for hours to install bitcoin core on Ubuntu. I'm also not that geeky and its a little complicated for me. I'm a bit of the average Joe you know
@_date: 2014-06-16 23:59:31
Can satoshi change the code even now?

@_date: 2014-11-16 14:12:28
I spend too. But you can say you HODL federel reserve notes but you also spend. I have a certain amount not available for spending and some for spending
@_date: 2014-09-30 11:03:18
Too buy bitcoins, yes its required
@_date: 2014-12-30 02:09:17
When did I ever say anything about storing dollars?
@_date: 2014-06-22 20:56:13
I have 90% in cold storage
@_date: 2014-10-10 00:05:37
That's what I did ;)
@_date: 2014-08-05 18:08:18
But wouldn't you have to send your bitcoins to your main address anyway?
@_date: 2014-06-20 00:29:52
No. How does that make you any sense?
@_date: 2014-09-16 11:59:25
Just select Bitcoin where it says Currency before you do anything and it displays everything in Bitcoin. You just have to manually send it to his address. Which I like since it's like vanilla bitcoin instead of using coin base or bit pay.
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:13:11
They currently don't have any US id's so they can't sign up for Coinbase or bitstamp or anything. Also I'm not "laundering money" I am buying bitcoin for him. And then selling it in December and returning it too him. He/she doesn't even have a bitcoin wallet. I will be buying. Storing. And selling under my control. He will never have access to these coins.
@_date: 2014-12-30 01:38:15
Not to sound like a butt head but I started using bitcoins last year. So far my money has lost value of about 280%
@_date: 2014-10-15 18:29:13
Incorrect, 
@_date: 2014-09-29 22:51:52
Good idea! 
@_date: 2014-06-14 00:19:29
Well almost all options there require a bank
@_date: 2014-06-02 21:33:38
There is a fine line between making a mistake and making a dumb mistake. A mistake is like not backing up your wallet, it happens to the best of us. But send HALF A MILLION dollars worth of BTC is simply an idiotic move. I agree that we shouldn't be kicking him/her but be realistic. 
@_date: 2014-12-02 16:27:01
The person I was arguing with said that bitcoin can't be traces and is mostly anonymous. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 14:04:25
It says it vulnerable.
@_date: 2014-06-11 19:07:25
I'm 14 so really all money I have I can afford to lose since I have no expenses.
@_date: 2014-06-12 14:00:34
Wow that's a bit odd
@_date: 2014-04-21 15:03:25
The blockchain also isn't showing this 0.6BTC Transaction At ALL. Look at my transaction history here 
The last couple transactions were the 0.4BTC I just recieved from coinbase. But it does not show my 0.6BTC Transaction. Blockchain isn't showing neither my 0.6BTC or my 0.4BTC transactions.
@_date: 2014-12-25 22:48:27
Why is that? He can buy any thing he wants with it now. Its the same as2$
@_date: 2014-06-19 21:21:26
From silk road? Lol jk
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:23:45
Thanks A lot! I erased bit coin in application support and now I downloaded and installed it and now it works! it's currently at 5,000. You've saved my life I don't know how to thank you. Also kind of a noob question but how can I tip someone bit coin on is I can't post addresses.
@_date: 2014-11-04 00:05:57
That's also important :)
@_date: 2014-04-21 15:19:39
-I decide to move my bit coins to a new safer paper wallet
-I sweep my Old paper wallet from 0.6BTC
-I now have these bit coins in my block chain.info wallet
-I scan my new safer paper wallet into block chain.info just so I have the address in my account and won't have copy and paste every time I want to send BTC
-I check the balance of my new safer BTC wallet and it shows 0.00
-I check my transaction history and it shows I sent it to the wrong address.
Now i'm screwed. Wait what exactly is a DDOS Attack, can I loose my BTC?
@_date: 2014-12-30 01:40:28
Wait wait, the whole point of bitcoin is to avoid banks. But banks aren't the  US Dollar. so why would you refuse when people say something about coinbase? 
@_date: 2014-09-16 19:06:15
@_date: 2014-06-01 18:14:56
Why the does it take so much work to install a program. You have to type in code and weird stuff instead of just downloading a .exe or .dmg. 
@_date: 2014-09-25 14:38:46
I'm not very "tech savvy" and I need directions on how to stay safe from this "bash" can someone please help?
@_date: 2014-06-10 21:17:36
I don't think 14 year olds do that anymore.
@_date: 2014-06-30 13:42:08
@_date: 2014-06-01 22:32:29
Why would I need security for running 1 program? I also tried for hours to indtal bitcoin qt but it never worked
@_date: 2014-10-09 17:31:33
You can, you have buy it through there website. They give you a code that you enter into vimeo, and then watch it. 
@_date: 2014-06-01 04:01:28
Wow thanks man!
@_date: 2014-06-29 18:43:59
Well this was a problem on my fault, the same thing could happen if I used a credit card or debit card the chances of losing them are almost the same. I made a huge mistake. I would rate my bitcoin experience 9/10
@_date: 2014-03-26 13:35:29
Remember guys, I requested them from CoinCult. Great work by the way, don't know how you do it. But your work is amazing
@_date: 2014-10-05 13:03:32
Circle doesn't even work
@_date: 2014-09-17 14:05:21
Oh well I didn't know that. I Only had a mac for a while now.
@_date: 2014-03-29 23:47:26
That's good. We need early adopter for the future generations
@_date: 2014-10-07 13:24:07
It would massively increase. Although I would say it won't ever go higher then 10,000$ a coin. Its just to high for just one Bitcoin. I would say it will stabilize around 3,000$ if it gets mass adoption
@_date: 2014-11-05 18:25:16
Try again next time.
@_date: 2014-08-04 16:48:25
Except with them you have to trust them.
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:19:52
I use bit coin for money....
@_date: 2014-09-21 22:05:12
1200$ for an iphone? Are you fucking insane?
@_date: 2014-10-02 00:20:52

@_date: 2014-08-08 14:31:29
@_date: 2014-06-30 01:24:55
That's what coinbase and BlockChain are for
@_date: 2014-06-20 12:26:50
I think I worded it wrong. What I meant to say was that a currency should not be able to be destroyed simply by computing power.
@_date: 2014-11-05 18:10:23
You put the change tip after it ;)
@_date: 2014-10-09 17:41:04
It is pretty cool, i'm watching it right now. It's amazing and the average joe can watch it without confusion.
@_date: 2014-09-16 11:59:37
Just select Bitcoin where it says Currency before you do anything and it displays everything in Bitcoin. You just have to manually send it to his address.
@_date: 2014-06-12 15:08:43
A email service based on bitcoin protocol. Instead of sending BTC you send messages
@_date: 2014-09-10 13:03:01
With the BlockChain wallet you can add watch only addresses. So you add a paper wallet but you won't be able to spend it.
@_date: 2014-11-02 14:15:44
Would it be a better idea to keep 2 normal paper wallets somewhere very safe, example: in a jar underground or similar. And then just keep a the rest on sd cards/thumb drives encrypted with true crypt? I mean I bet trucrypt is the same as bip38 if not better am I correct? although then I rely on technology. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 01:22:09
I actually don't own anything besides bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-11-02 13:43:23
I think encrypting even with your own name is safe. I mean if someone steals it, it's gonna take them atlas 2-3 hours to get the password. Also that's enough time to for you too remove those btc into a new wallet. 
@_date: 2014-06-12 01:03:07
Yes but I would also have to have the key somewhere written. But it doesn't matter since its encrypted right? Also I have a good amount of BTC. Should I divide them by 1btcper wallet or something else. I have 5btc
@_date: 2014-12-18 19:10:24
As long as you don't use a web based wallet, and use a good password. Bitcoin is as or even safer than a bank. And it can't be frozen and taken away from you.
@_date: 2014-06-11 22:29:30
@_date: 2014-06-09 02:20:24
Were did you get these?
@_date: 2014-10-14 02:51:13
Why not, its not like they profit from it
@_date: 2014-11-16 21:17:33
I've only invested a couple hundred bucks. For fun
@_date: 2014-10-08 00:21:38
But the address changes every time I open the app right? So do my bitcoins move along with it.
@_date: 2014-04-21 15:01:03
Yes but I copied the address directly from blockchain in my recieving addresses. Blockchain imported my address incorrectly. Also blockchain is not showing this transaction in my acccount AT ALL now. Its also not showing the transaction I just sent from coinbase. Some is wrong 
@_date: 2014-06-28 23:56:59
@_date: 2014-12-19 18:22:56
No, very if you have a password you should be OK.
@_date: 2014-09-15 17:39:14
Me personally, I would recommend blockchain.info  Very safe and is not owned by anyone and is decentralized. Also coinbase is a very good online exchange (If you 18 unlike me) and they also function in the UK as of a couple of days ago. Good luck!
@_date: 2014-05-27 21:05:12
Isn't MultiBit the only way you can use your backup? And I don't think there's a way to get your private key from them since I tried to find out for hours. Is there a way to find your private key on BlockChain?
@_date: 2014-06-17 20:35:07
By who
@_date: 2014-06-05 21:51:56
He sent me the $1000 in may, I sent him back his investment. I never made any money on him. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 13:33:24
That's an extremely unrealistic scenario. They might take down your sentence from 10 years to 9 but that's,as far as they will go.
@_date: 2014-06-07 19:26:51
I just bookmark BlockChain, no way of losing it that way
@_date: 2014-06-17 18:13:29

Just get a cheap safe (the metal will be thin) and setup a password with your eyes closed and just press rand buttons in 2019 or whatever just try and open it with saws and stuff

It was a torrent, it had a couple other files in the folder but I just ignored them which was a mistake on my part.
@_date: 2014-11-02 16:29:34
Depends, if you use dictionary words, and no special characters. I bet after a couple months of mom stop brute force. So really the chances are very loe
@_date: 2014-04-13 21:07:25
No need to be so mean. The price will almost for sure go back up. But people are panicking
@_date: 2014-06-29 00:45:45
Ok but this store really is a high quality store, it's not the "natural" stuff that's sold in publix or costco. Everything in the store is made from companies that are very small. Almost every label on anything looks like it's printed on a normal house printer and taped on. Which is a good thing.
@_date: 2014-11-17 02:25:33
I've been using bitcoin since last year and this is a first. I'm just doing a deed warning others.
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:02:22

@_date: 2014-03-25 17:59:05

Please note, the changetip isn't actually how bitcoin works. It's just a third party extension.
@_date: 2014-09-11 01:23:59
Well you will probably never encounter a merchant that isn't using bit pay or coin base. And they have they're own system that prevents double spend and makes it impossible.
@_date: 2014-09-29 16:32:22
0.03 is a very good price for three. When will they be available? Also what plastic do you print them with? I'm tired of keeping my paper wallets in a envelope. Also do you have a template on which I can print them?
@_date: 2014-09-10 12:51:57
The whole bitcoin ecosystem is based on math and encryption. Sure we've seen many bitcoin heists but all of these stolen bitcoins are from websites that don't actually use the blockchain to secure their bitcoins. You will never hear of a BIP38 paper wallet or electrum wallet being stolen. Unless ofcourse someone compromises your paper wallet and your password. 
@_date: 2014-12-31 14:11:21
The keys are encrypted, although with a 6 digit pin.
@_date: 2014-09-10 17:12:08
Its extremley quick. What do you mean?
@_date: 2014-10-12 14:46:38
The transaction will go through, but you need to connect it to the internet to receive. It or spend it
@_date: 2014-06-14 18:45:45
I'm from Stamford CT, only thing is that I'm 14 so it could be kind of weird.

I just wanted to see peoples opinions
@_date: 2014-09-15 19:39:01
Yeah Blockchain.info should really change their name, it's really annoying. They have no access to private keys and passwords. They can't steal your money even if they made an effort too.
@_date: 2014-06-20 02:54:47
Wow thanks for the awesome recommendation. Although he said someone would need 400 million to destroy bitcoin. Isn't that basically nothing for someone like Google or a government. Is this price increasing as difficulty increases?
@_date: 2014-10-12 14:43:12
Because its vandalism of government property.
@_date: 2014-11-20 04:11:05
Solution, use an VPN. I have a 8$ a month VPN (played for with bitcoin of course) and I don't even notice it. It just works and changes IP's every 15 min

Yesterday I opened an encrypted USB drive, it is triple layered encrypted and once I opened a paper wallet which was my dads bitcoins. His was also stolen. I immediatly closed it. The hacker must have had a keylogger and screenshots. I only keep 0.3 on my hot wallet. Also i'm not gonna use shitful linux bullshit. Wait for some more info before you talk shit about someone.
@_date: 2014-06-13 21:45:37
What type of backup?
@_date: 2014-10-09 22:08:02
@_date: 2014-11-05 18:01:49
Go to 
Click "Decrypt Private Key"
Copy and Paste the Private Key and try and guess the password. From their you can import the decrypted private key into an online wallet like blockchain.info.
@_date: 2014-06-29 18:36:56
The folder had a couple files in it. I ignored it.

Its more seamless and does not require a third-party email to function. The average Joe doesn't want to learn about PGP and instead would want it done automatically.

A wallet outside of paper wallets. for semi hot wallet use. By semi I mean something that is secure but can be used quickly
@_date: 2014-06-22 21:41:14
Why is that
@_date: 2014-03-25 13:51:41
I'm getting tired of people bashing bit coin. I never asked for what you responded with. I asked what paper to use and for a template. Not for you to express your opinion.
@_date: 2014-11-01 19:49:57
Not that I know of. Open image editor and copy and paste them into their. I can do it for you if you want
@_date: 2014-10-02 00:18:21

Labeling transactions inside your wallet is safe. Labeling it on the blockchain is something different.
@_date: 2014-11-04 00:05:42
Haha. Labeling your transactions inside an application like mycelium. I'm not talking about labeling on the blockchain.

Have some fun with paper wallets! It's really fun and teaches you about public keys and  private keys and also how to properly store bitcoins. That's how I learned most of my bit coining stuff.

I noticed my self that it takes about 3-4 minutes to access a trezor, you also must have a computer present and an internet connection. @_date: 2014-07-18 12:54:56
so suppose I bought some BTC on coin base, are they automatically white bit coins even if they are used with a bit coin mixer.
@_date: 2014-08-08 23:19:37
It's called in person. Just ask the restaurant that accepts BTC.
@_date: 2014-06-19 23:13:48
He doesn't want a third-party storing his bitcoins and his private keys.

You import the paper wallet into your account (Coinbase, mycelium, BlockChain etc.) And spend!

I don't see why everyone recommends Linux, I tried it yesterday and  its slow as shit.takes minutes to open a file or window. I tried everything trust me. Then I couldn't even get bitcoin at or bitcoind installed. Just hours of work to fix one and another pops up. Such bullshit I wouldn't recommend Linux or Ubuntu to anyone.

I would tip you 10000 bits, but i'm won't. You deserve a cookie.

Yes. But how wod the reciever know if someone opened it?

I don't understand why everyone recommends localBTC. First off most of them are paypal, western union or some other bullshit. And the ones that want cash are usually $700 a coin.
@_date: 2014-11-21 13:52:27
The wallet doesn't invade your privacy. The code doesn't allow him to see your balances. Even if it did, what's the point? he would just see that this person has this much BTC. So what?
@_date: 2014-06-21 01:21:55
Oh yes it does, it has huge problems. And bitcoin fixes these problems. Although bitcoins do have there flaws but in generain.
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:18:41
Except I'm worried my bank will flag me for doing something illegal. Which I am not

Well he is asking you to never use the wallets again and remove any funds from them. I wouldn't see the point of this if it was a hacker. Seems legit to me

A small update. I got my blockchain backup into multibit. Multibit shows I have 1.7BTC and shows my 0.4 BTC I just sent from Coinbase into my main account . Although blockchain.info does not show this. Multibit also does not show the transaction of those 0.6BTC. I'm getting really confused.
@_date: 2014-11-03 15:50:31
An example, 1 month ago I sent 1 BTC to a paper wallet. Now I look and I have no idea if I had bought something for that BTC or if it was just a transfer. My friend also asked what amount I transferred to his wallet a while back. How the fuck do I know? I don't remember. All my wallet says is 0.5829521 to 1Ldklfd09432
@_date: 2014-09-14 14:56:52

It doesn't have to compete. Although in most eyes of bitcoin enthusiasts it's a competition. Apple Pay is a very quick and easy way of paying for goods, similar to bitcoin.

Exactly, i'm 14 so it's easy to say the young generation is adapting to bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-08 01:56:55
I've been holding for a while now (Well over a year). You have a point, if bitcoin tenfolds like in previus years. Then the 10% loss of using localbitcoins will not be a big deal. But still using coinbase is much much easier and cheaper.
@_date: 2014-03-20 16:48:30
Hey man no need to be so aggressive, i'm just trying to make a point. When USD first came out it also had it's problems and needed fixes. Like counterfeiting, stealing, etc. Every new thing needs to grow into it. If you really wanted to you could find an apartment for rent. I'm just a lucky guy who is in a location were I can buy almost anything for bit coin. If you want to stick with cash/credit then it's there choice. Bitcoin still has to adapt to the new world and be easier to use for the average joe.
@_date: 2014-06-09 17:47:04
To be exact I have 3.1 BTC in cold storage and 0.80 in hot, I will go down to 0.5 soon

It depends on how much risk you are prepared to take, in my opinion coinbase is a bit more convenient but there is the risk factor. It's a decision one has to make.

@_date: 2014-06-11 11:09:26
Yes I would charge, it depends how long the process would take to generate it. Otherwise it would be free. And me not taking your private key well I guess you would just have to trust me on that one. I have done a lot of business here on r/bitcoin and people trusted me so I guess its up to you.
@_date: 2014-05-25 13:35:15
Why would that be important?

@_date: 2014-03-20 16:38:24
Well you are pretty much 100% right with the speed. Although i'm sure bit coin will develop a similar if not identical way of payment just like a credit card/debit. On the other hand the first dollar bill was 1862. We've come along way since that time and Bitcoin is only 5 years old. We will probably come up with something faster and quicker in the near future. Oh and no need to be aggressive.
@_date: 2014-07-29 17:26:13
You deserve an award. Hats off to you

@_date: 2014-11-04 00:04:52
Pretty much. I keep it in their to make sure I don't lose it. I travel a ton so I lose things easily.
@_date: 2014-10-14 02:52:40
I paid for it. Instantly got a email with no problems. Sucks for you :/ good luck
@_date: 2014-05-25 15:55:41
Oh sorry I. Didn't know. Its not vandalizing if its a good cause
@_date: 2014-10-15 12:48:50
But I'm operating without an Msb license.
@_date: 2014-10-31 16:42:50
Someone is keeping your money safe for you? Obviusley your going to have to pay them, it's not like their just going to do you a favor and do it for free.
@_date: 2014-10-09 21:56:36
Oh come on man, these guys spent a couple years making it and you already torrented it? just give people a chance to buy it.
@_date: 2014-10-05 12:02:19
What's the point of that?
@_date: 2014-11-03 12:41:15
I bet some deep web guy would have bip38'd it. 
@_date: 2014-10-31 23:47:17
Its not about trust. Its about if trezor accepted software will exist in 5-10 years
@_date: 2014-04-12 12:05:57
Ok I just have a couple questions. What tax rate do I pay? I'm a resident in Connecticut if that helps. Also do I only pay for taxes on my bit coin sells from 2013? and what form should I fill out? i'm also 14 does this still mean I need to pay taxes?
@_date: 2014-09-10 13:41:12
I personally love my M8 over my old S4. Can't imagine what could replace it.
@_date: 2014-10-06 15:18:16
Yes I know it's not good to be rude. I'm not rude to them at all, I haven't really said anything to them. I'm just rude here since I know i'm probably not gonna be talking with any one from circle. It's that I don't understand why it's only be getting rejected, and no one else is having this probelm.
@_date: 2014-04-13 12:45:43
That's why you shouldn't invest money you can't afford to lose
@_date: 2014-06-11 23:26:52
How will I get scammed if I'm not spending it
@_date: 2014-08-05 03:33:05
Thanks for the support!
@_date: 2014-03-29 22:13:49
Well my parents don't even know what bitcoin is. Your comment is pretty ignorsnt
@_date: 2014-06-27 01:07:17
Sarcasom? 
@_date: 2014-06-04 18:42:23
Do you just type like 200 bit coins and then @_date: 2014-09-05 01:48:42
Wow that's amazing, donated 0.008 ;)
@_date: 2014-11-03 17:47:29
That's the point i'm trying to make. Many people forget about this, and it may cause problem in the future. I'm just trying to give a heads up to the community :)
@_date: 2014-11-01 18:56:08
That's all you do? Make a second account and go troll? Get a life bro
@_date: 2014-12-28 22:22:29
You can't really use electrum for everyday spending. 
@_date: 2014-12-30 03:27:54
The problem was caused by bitcoin though. If it was a case regarding US dollars the cash could be traced through bank accounts and soon be found. 
Just a note, i'm not defending the dollar. I love bitcoin and swear by it. I'm just arguing the fact that r/bitcoin is becoming an unproffesional subreddit.
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:32:18
He/she is fairly wealthy and can afford to loose 10k. If the price is not up in December he will wait until it is a good time to sell 
@_date: 2014-10-09 17:49:29
No, just watching it.
@_date: 2014-10-02 15:30:39
Yes, but what will that do?
@_date: 2014-05-27 15:18:16
Did you look at the second image? She said she will forward the request to her supervisor.
@_date: 2014-06-05 21:53:38
Thanks sir!
@_date: 2014-07-23 22:25:55
That's awesome, although most brit's don't like Polish peeps. I don't know why, they seem like great people to me.
@_date: 2014-10-09 12:49:32
Restricting learning about bitcoin to 18+? why in the hell would someone do that. I'm 14, without the subreddit I wouldn't be using bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-08-07 12:59:42
@_date: 2014-11-03 13:42:31
Wow, that's awesome! 1$ @_date: 2014-11-03 18:31:08
I love that word
@_date: 2014-09-16 20:13:30
What the hell is your problem? I just shared a website that accepts bitcoin. Anonymous is a non-violent activist group. I never met up with "friends" to go out with people i've never met. All I did was buy a Guy Fawkes key chain. Like seriously dude. Anonymous has done amazing things farther more than you can even comprehend. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 15:43:57
Yep, an order takes 4 business days. So if you order before the weekend, for example thursday it will take 6 total days.
@_date: 2014-12-25 22:47:43
I actually did do it
@_date: 2014-09-16 13:49:37
Because during a revolution, it doesn't matter WHO is behind the mask because they all are one group. If you think otherwise your just a brainwashed sheep. 
@_date: 2014-06-11 23:07:17
I've been in bitcoin for over a year and haven't sold once haha
@_date: 2014-04-21 17:55:39
Since Blockchain was being so buggy. It looks like the transaction NEVER wen't through at all. I got saved. 
@_date: 2014-06-17 00:17:06
Wait, is satoshi the guy releasing all these bitcoin core updates
@_date: 2014-11-16 14:12:28
I spend too. But you can say you HODL federel reserve notes but you also spend. I have a certain amount not available for spending and some for spending
@_date: 2014-07-25 01:14:02
@_date: 2014-06-13 13:48:20
Wait so a P2P node is just someone running there own bitcoin core full node and connecting to it?
@_date: 2014-09-18 19:24:37
Except I must rely on third-party software. I use a seperate laptop only used for paper wallets creating and decrypting. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 11:26:33
I have a bank account by the way.
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:25:08
What do you expect the price to be my July 1st?
@_date: 2014-06-22 10:17:05
You do realize 60 million is like pocket change for a government
@_date: 2014-06-09 12:16:18
Most probably not, although try and run it next to an air conditioner or in a well ventilated room.
@_date: 2014-03-25 18:54:47
Yes i'm definitely interested. I'm looking for something just like your harvard one. If your actually in Harvard (Congrats). The color scheme is perfect. Although removing the harvard bit coin club and all harvard related things just remove them. Other than that it looks pretty good. Maybe replace them with bit coin logos? Same logos as the dorian one just change them to match the colors. I'll be waiting for those drafts. Good luck
@_date: 2014-08-11 07:40:02
It would cost me 0. I have 2 physical copies of my paper wallets. Then 3 copies of all of them on separate USB drives. Then 2 copies on my two computers. And one copy on a CD. All encrypted with true crypt with different passwords for each one and all are BIP38. Yeah I guess you could say I'm Gucci.
@_date: 2014-12-30 03:22:40
price went down 3x.
@_date: 2014-08-27 11:20:45
BIP38 paper wallets, can't trust any software or electronics.
@_date: 2014-08-05 03:12:07
Exactly. I think i'll just get a parent to make an account with coinbase since coinbase doesn't require an ID or any type of real hassle unless you want to raise your daily buy limit to 50,000 Feder reserve bank notes. I travel a lot by my self. I'm actually flying to Germany this Friday and my parents prefer me to use bitcoin then convert to Euro at an ATM If I really need to (Close to my relatives home). 
@_date: 2014-08-06 22:24:12
Wow! Thanks for all the help. Only question i'm a bit skeptical about. I use Chase. Would it be possible for me to simply walk in to Bank of America or something and just deposit money into your account. Don't I have to sign the deposit slip with my name?
@_date: 2014-10-31 14:18:02
The only reason someone would swipe a paper wallet is to use it in a hot wallet.
@_date: 2014-06-02 12:23:12
Yes I installed it onto the hdd
@_date: 2014-04-03 02:06:09
These things are awesome! Not only are they made from natural Hemp Oil but there also bit coin themed AND I paid for them in bit coin, pretty awesome things.
@_date: 2014-06-11 23:42:05
How so?
@_date: 2014-03-22 16:12:21
After reading your reply I actually do see a resemblance to apple. Although it did not go through my head while making it.
@_date: 2014-04-28 14:30:12
@_date: 2014-08-08 12:50:05
In those days a "Bitcoin" Will be barely existent. It will be just bits and satoshis. How many bitcoins does the rumking have? 10, WOWW
@_date: 2014-11-07 16:58:20
If you make 1500BTC a year you can probably afford this villa....
@_date: 2014-10-09 22:08:38
I just watched the whole thing. Honestly it was amazing. I was honestly sad that it ended.
@_date: 2014-06-17 12:28:21
Because you a little faggot bitch. Just kidding. The reason is that (in my opiniom) satoshi didn't think bitcoin would go so mainstream so he wasn't expecting the difficulty to do so high. Although its a good thing since it preserved when all the bitcoins will be mined. The longer the better. Just like rum
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:19:17
If I know the money is legal. Is it OK go do?
@_date: 2014-06-12 22:21:02
Why is that?
@_date: 2014-06-26 03:40:39
Yes it is very valid. Paper wallets worked the same since day 1
@_date: 2014-06-09 16:55:53
So yo would rather store your bitcoins somewhere on a random website. With no address and no names anywhere?
@_date: 2014-08-06 22:40:43
Ok thanks for the help.
@_date: 2014-07-25 18:44:05
But there is a risk of double spending
@_date: 2014-10-02 00:25:24
Imagine getting thousands of new users in under 24 hours. Let's give it some time.
@_date: 2014-08-05 03:09:05
I don't think Cash meetup is a good idea for a 14 year old. Could I just get a parent to make an acccount and buy from there?
@_date: 2014-08-05 16:04:57
Whats the point of using a new address everytime
@_date: 2014-04-14 02:03:24
You can't make such a broad statement without any proof. Bitcoin HAS gone up and tremendous percent many times, it is likely to happen again.
@_date: 2014-08-08 02:31:49
I'm under 18 so that's the reason i'm forced to use it.
@_date: 2014-06-19 20:16:06
I don't really trust brain wallets, since they require a third party service to redeem.
@_date: 2014-06-01 12:01:21
@_date: 2014-10-15 13:46:01
The guy in Florida sold 30,000$ in btc when he was arrested. U won't be doing more than 1k a day
@_date: 2014-09-28 01:28:55
Didn't I recently her news of Coinbase having over 1 million accounts?
@_date: 2014-06-27 00:56:33
There also sponsoring Zywiec beer. Make sure to buy there beer and ask them to accept bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-09-17 12:14:25
So you think police killing innocent kids is OK? You think government monitoring everything you do is OK? You think PM's destroying their country is OK? Something is wrong with you, I honestly feel bad for you. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 18:38:01
Except he would need about 500$ to start off.
@_date: 2014-04-21 16:43:46
Oh sorry, I kind of was in panic when I lost my 0.6BTC. I bet you would do the same. I wanted help as fast as possible so I wanted to type it as fast as I could.
@_date: 2014-07-12 03:25:53
I don't think going to the bank and depositing cash and waiting for the person to send you the btc is very time consuming and inconvenient.
@_date: 2014-06-08 13:36:38
This flaw in bitcoin is horrible, it could end btc forever.
@_date: 2014-09-18 16:34:42
Also is the pin a 9 digit? do I have to remember it forever? and also I don't understand the question mark thing. Do I click the question marks to reveal something? do I type in the numbers? I can't find this info anywhere
@_date: 2014-06-16 23:56:50
This is why I love r/bitcoin
@_date: 2014-05-25 15:25:56
My brother asked me if I could build a really fast PC for him. I asked for what and he said for mining bitcoin. I researched and I got hooked. And here I am. Thanks brother
@_date: 2014-06-11 18:13:05
The only thing that's holding bitcoin back is misinformation.
@_date: 2014-03-25 03:31:25
Oh no, I think you guys have got the wrong idea here. I just want to use them to store bit coins for a longer period of time. Giving them as gifts to my friends and family. I definitely don't intend to sell these. I will only be using them for long term investments. I just want it to be durable enough to not wash away or rip.
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:44:32
It goes to show that when someone recieves it they make an account through changetip, meaning they probably are learning about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:46:32
Exactly. Although since the price is so low people aren't as generous. When the price was 1000+ people were tipping like crazy!
@_date: 2015-01-01 14:16:28
Well coinbase IS bitcoin. You have to use it in order to use bitcoin (unless you work or get bitcoins for free). Just like the US dollar, you must use a bank in todays world.
@_date: 2015-01-08 14:40:19
You know who else moved to Tokyo?
@_date: 2015-01-11 13:52:41
You use words like "massive" and "high effort". Showing you are completely biased for bitcoin
@_date: 2015-01-01 14:15:02
It makes it look like you HAVE to buy bitcoins locally if your using mycelium.
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:19:00
Can I deposit money into the account, but not buy? So like I deposit 100 but only trade 30$ at a time?
@_date: 2014-06-17 18:13:57
Dogeocin is not a legitimate currency.
@_date: 2014-10-03 11:48:17
You can just backup to paper with BlockChain.info and import it comes here else
@_date: 2015-01-04 01:56:24
So something like darkcoin isn't a scam?
@_date: 2015-01-26 19:19:11
I think the problem was more that the rocket tipped too much for the rocket to save it
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:29:33
Wow, Bitstamp handled this really well. So far I think this is the most professional reaction to a hack. Kudos for Bitstamp!

@_date: 2015-01-04 18:12:49
When did I mention price?
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:33:47
Ok. Thanks for the help!
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:44:48
It's a service called changetip, search for it on google.
@_date: 2015-01-26 18:02:37
Because all the weight is above it. Imagine pushing a cart with a 30 foot steel structure balancing on it. 
@_date: 2015-01-21 00:35:44
It's the same as installing only windows. No more safer than just a windows computer. But as long as you use it for ONLY bitcoin and nothing else. It should be safe since you will have no virus, trojans, etc. Recommend you install ubuntu or similar.
@_date: 2015-01-05 18:25:48
What about paper wallets? If made correctly they should be the safest of all. With BIP38 of horse.
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:48:16
Random. If I saw something I liked, I would tip the person, just like you would tip a musician in town square. Mostly on youtube, to people I think are doing great with videos are just a funny comment.
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:00:20
I agree. Trezor is making it very easy for Joe to use bitcoin. Banks actually use similar technology
@_date: 2015-01-04 01:57:35
So your saying there's a chance
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:13:38
Too me. Its basic and not complicated. But I'm talking about normal people who don't really want to research it.
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:47:21
Which is why I said "Reddit and Youtube". If I see a good comment on Youtube I usually tip a dollar. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 03:41:10
You sir, were incorrect!
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:33:29
I'm with you! Hodl for life
@_date: 2015-01-23 17:26:06
The title cuts off his sentense midway. You could say Warran Buffet said "bitcoin so great" but really he said "bitcoin is great but will never succeed.
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:46:50
That's what I mean. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:01:08
Its just a name. I understand bitcoin
@_date: 2015-01-08 14:41:08
I've heard of people getting swat at their house for using purse.io
@_date: 2015-01-08 19:44:36
I'm not selling, but i'm just saying that for a "currency" this owuld be horrible and probably over. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 23:45:53
Tipping a waitress is standard these days, it's a normal thing to do. Tipping on somewhere like reddit means to someone "wow, my work was so good people gave me money to say thanks". 
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:00:52
Yes it is a problem. But we can't fox it. So we have to find a way to make it easy for joe
@_date: 2014-06-22 21:18:00
I have it bookmarked. Could it be just someone guessed my alias?
@_date: 2014-09-08 21:23:56
Haha my Mac always autocorrects it to bit coin when it should be bitcoin and no I don't support dol-lar
@_date: 2014-11-07 13:17:24
Thank you
@_date: 2015-05-18 20:27:01
Because bitcoin is often compared it bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:12:59
@_date: 2014-06-11 23:07:16
I've been in bitcoin for over a year and haven't sold once haha
@_date: 2014-06-07 17:55:01
How did you do that?
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:54:08
I've seen like 30 posts in the last 2 weeks about people's transactions taking more than a day to confirm.
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:43:20
You're right. But would you rather live believing that you might be a millionaire one day, or live believing that you could have been a millionaire. Bitcoin isn't going anywhere anytime soon, don't worry. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:32:13
I think he is complying that it's been 9 hours and no confirmations
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:28:48
This made it so hard for me, and still is to this day. Get a parent to open an account and have them buy it for you. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:14:11
I remember these posts in 2013, some people never change. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:26:23
Back in 2013 I thought I was late to the party. Times change. Always buy, regardless of price. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:40:00
Don't spend the money dude... you're 16 and you'll spend it on something completely pointless. Save it. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:02:52
I believe it's possible but as far as I'm aware he doesn't have a history in cryptography. Although I would doubt that he could learn it all in 8 hours.
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:27:03
I felt pretty dumb when I baught it at 1200$, It didn't bounce back for a very long time.

Nice one *fist bump*

Oh boy. Not gonna discuss it here but their are a ton of hard cold facts about 9/11

Well that's a good way to accept others opinions.

So you don't believe in evolution nor the big bang?
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:39:39
Argued with a JP Morgan about the future of bitcoin, he said it would never return to 1200$. Boy oh boy how good was that feeling of texting him $4700
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:14:15
I’m sure if there was a way to track it, 80% or more would be criminal related. Whether you like it or not, one of bitcoins main uses is for paying for narcotics and criminal activities. You can’t deny it.
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:55:32
There is no way to prove it. But based on what I’ve seen in the last 4-5 years, I see very little people buying bitcoins to transfer money, or at least in the us. 
@_date: 2015-04-04 12:33:38
Nope. Bought the BTC yesterday.
@_date: 2015-04-04 12:46:18
Nope. JetBlue flyfi is free

Most services like that have a limit of 1000$
@_date: 2015-04-03 12:49:12
Yes. 3,000 feet is the difference between banking and bitcoin.

How did you manage to send 6,000$ for free? Usually when I send internationally I pay 5% or more,
