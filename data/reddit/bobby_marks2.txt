They don't really need to. He admitting to losing X amount yesterday, which means they can figure out from these posts how much he holds in BTC. Then put him on the hook for payments in the relevant USD. They don't even need to prove he actually has it, because he's admitted to hiding it.

It won't recover if one crash leads to more selloffs. That's why trading cards tend to stagnate and drop off until/unless scarcity kicks in. But BTC can't become scarce unless it sits dormant, which isn't good for long term stability.

Trading cards and other physical collectables tend to climb in price due to destruction of some leading to scarcity of remaining copies. Bitcoin doesn't have that benefit, even if there is a limited supply.

I'm not talking little bumps in the road to growth. Eventually, there are no new adopters, no growth, like peak oil but in Bitcoin interest from the public. At that point, like a commodity, Bitcoin will become much less desirable to invest in, because there's no growth left. It will stop being a speculative investment and either be a pure currency or die.

The easy solution is to create a  super PAC, donate to that super PAC, and then have the super PAC donate to Snowden.
Works for US politicians.
