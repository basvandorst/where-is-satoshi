Nobody can predict what bitcoin will do, or tell you what to do with your money. If you believe in bitcoin and are ok with the potential loss of $500-600 if bitcoin fails, then buy one. If not, don't.

Nothing is inevitable. Nobody can predict the future.

Uh. You resist. That's it. If you believe it will continue to rise, wait. If not and you wanted a short term investment, cash out. 
If it's going to be hard for you to resist cashing out, go paper wallet and lock it away so you can't think about it or touch it for awhile.

With all due respect, everybody needs to STOP asking this sort of question. 
Nobody can predict the future. Nobody knows what will happen with bitcoin, from second to second, day to day, or month to month. Ever.
Buy if you have the funds and are ok risking losing them. Buy if you believe in bitcoin. Don't buy if you don't believe in it, or can't risk losing money.
We really need a sticky for this sort of question. It's getting annoying. And as more and more uninformed people start checking out bitcoin, this is only going to get worse. Sigh.

Is reddit your moral compass or something? We can't answer for you. But in my humble opinion, you'd be quite a jerk if you asked for it back. You gave it to him. You didn't tell him he could borrow it.
