I would also very much like to see a policy that describes what would happen in the event of a security failure.
Would there be any cases where you would suspend trading, either for an individual or for all traders registered on the site?
If so, can you outline the specific decision-making process that would justify you to take such an action?
If not, can you give an explicitly guarantee that you would never cease trading or hold funds?

He specifically mentioned getting a consistent exchange rate over a month, though. Does Coinbase do that?

The IMF estimates that 50% of the world will use Bitcoin by 2025?

I like "mikes" for micro-bitcoins (0.000001 BTC).
A thousand nano to a mike.

I'm in NZ. Bitcoin-OTC is my favourite way to trade.

Thanks for the offer. I took a tip from a fellow Redditor and transferred some cash via [VirWox]( in the end.

If it's a problem, just introduce a new way of writing numbers:


If you think that's weird, or that people might not get it, think about the weird combination of symbols we've learned to incorporate into our lives: ` ` ` `.com` have all become familiar without much of a fuss.
Or even better, add micro levels of BTC:


"I'd like to buy that sandwich for 5 micro-bitcoins, please."
Give language time to adjust:


And a bit more time:

I'm a kiwi, and I managed it with VirWox. I'll PM you the same instructions another Redditor gave to me.

Yeah, but at the end of the month you've still got all the money you've made _and_ the computers. You could sell the rig and still be up.
@_date: 2011-05-11 20:29:38
I'll PM you too.
@_date: 2011-06-08 10:31:25
Quite right. Back of the napkin, that's all.
@_date: 2011-05-20 00:36:03
Well, you got a discussion going at least.

Also, think how confusing it was with olden day money. How many pence sterling to a farthing, again? We managed fine then.

A lot of the solutions I see require you to send US$ via mail. That's tricky for me, being in New Zealand. Would anyone be willing to trade with me over PayPal for a small amount, say US$20?

Interesting problem. I might give this a go later.

I think the message to ultimately take away here is this:


If all we do is mine and trade, we suffer the risk of playing out the scenarios so succinctly put in The Underground Economist's blog post. We need to be supporting existing merchants and trade, and starting new businesses that use Bitcoins.

Can you describe the flow a little better? How is a transaction made? 
Why is the amount 0.58 BTC, but the conversion 8.12 USD @ 14 BTC?
When does the merchant use the currency conversion?
Does the buyer get to see what they're purchasing on screen?
Do they see any discounts taken into account?
How does the buyer complete the transaction? Does the merchant prompt them to use a Bitcoin app on their phone?
Is there a wait period while the transaction is verified? What's happening during that time?
Where do you see people using this system?

If you release the code, I might hack on it a bit (I'm partial to a GitHub repo, personally).
