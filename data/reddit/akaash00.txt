Roger sounds like a very annoying child that cant get what he wants so he screams, interrupts en cry about it.  I think alot of people dont like his attitude even his own supporters.

Go to school again. It’s basic stuff. At the first situation you take de 6k as 100% , with the second situation you begin with 20k as 100%. That’s why you are confused. If you always take 6k as the whole 100% then 20k up is total of 300%(200% increased) en back to 6k is -200%
