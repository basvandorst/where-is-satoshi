And this is solution? I'm asking - how to give those 12 words someone in a way that is secure, without third parties, after i. e. my death (not before).

It's not excuse. If they don't have time they should quit and pick up boys that have time. At this very moment, bitcoin isn't just a game, bitcoin can make a difference in world functioning. Do you all are too blind (because securing BTCs good name) to see this? I'm so sure that they could find good devs within a days.

It's ok if you hodl and scream at the same time or sodl and scream at the same time. Just respect your neighbors.

Thanks. Better that than "will" solution.

Maybe because I didn't know about transaction melleability until all world experienced it recently. And maybe because I think BTC dev dudes are much smarther than me if they are in BTC dev team. Bitcoin doesn't have many known bugs to fix so why this window was open for 3 years and how much time would be open if gox problems didn't came out to daylight?

That was my point. To plunge people in good mood.

Interesting. First time I read about "time lock tx". I'm looking closer to it at google. Thanks! So far looks like best solution. Yet not ideal but most secure from what I already know.

I was deeply inspired by zombo.com

Maybe in US this would be good solution. I can asure you that there is a lot of countries where lawyer isn't most trustfull occupation. So, any ideas that not require **third party trust**. Any ideas that not require another living being at all?

I just can't believe that after discovering transaction malleability everything that BTC devs did for 3 years was wiki note about "not rely on TxID"

at the end he's like

No. You don't understand that gox screwed because they COULD. Because they COULD use tx mability. If that bug would be corrected by BTC devs nobody of us would talk about it ever. Do you see BTC devs fault now?

Block 478570 frozen. Sice then BCH price increased a lot. I don't think it's stupid.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:39:27
It isn't if you can drive price up before actually mining.

I've created BIP38 paper wallet and give it to my girlfriend. She has "private key" for wallet but doesn't have a passphrase for unlocking it. In other words - she has one of two mutlisign keys. Second key I've added to deadmansswitch.net and that's it! She will get second key after I don't respond to any emails from deadmansswitch in 65 days.
