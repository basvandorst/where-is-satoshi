Ye I will. I know it's a matter of time unregulated internet funbux take over the entire financial system and you get rich, so I do have fun now. /s

Very recent one tbh. Now I have waken up, now I am a believer in the 1500 different cryptos that will replace the entire financial system. Now I see the truth, which is nobody ever lost any bitcoin or got scammed using it. Now I can see why bitcoin is the only way! TYVM

Sure! Is there any other alternative that accomplishes those goals in a more efficient way?
I don't see why "takes effort to mine" is good, and same with the finite supply. 
And you can exchange cash for goods and services (every single legal good and service), and with bitcoin... no. Additionally, cash is much faster and more secure than bitcoin.
So... I can't see why those parallels make bitcoin a valuable asset.

Well, so you hate central banks unless they help you to moon. Isn't it?

You actually do, as you need another fool who wants to buy your useless asset! But hey, I just don't see the wall!
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:21:31
I don't see it
