that's why my original comment stated "there are billions that don't have the disposable income to HODL". I believe that when more merchants are accepting of it, people might decide to put more of their money into it because they won't be susceptible to government inflation, which can occur drastically in some of these countries.

I wouldn't say "indulge in such nonsense", but I do believe there are billions that don't have the disposable income to HODL. Probably will take mass adoption by merchants in order to switch, as people will not risk their next meal on some tech they probably won't fully understand

Mobile banking is already very popular. For a lot of rural people it might not be a feasible thing to do, but for those with access to banks to set up their mobile banking, they may also have access to systems that would allow them to set up wallets

Out of curiosity, do people buy it as an investment to hold onto a  more stable currency ("more stable" and "bitcoin"... not common together), or do they have use cases for them there? I live in Brazil and I don't see any people using it here. 
I'm curious because I believe the many people in Africa (and the rest of the world) don't have the disposable income to switch to this kind of currency without needing to spend it on a more regular basis. Not as easy to HODL when you need to eat. Of course there is a growing middle class in certain cities that can, but I'm more curious as to if you see many people with less money that will come in to buy much smaller amounts
