I tried buying coins through bitinstant the other day with cash using moneygram. I filled out all of the paperwork right and my payment was stuck due to zipzap not accepting it for some reason. So here I am coinless and hoping someone can tell me a for sure way to buy myself some coins. I would have preferred it when they were less than 50 but anything will do.

I used Bitinstant the first time I tried to buy coins. I used the cash payment through Moneygram. The payment somehow became stuck and wouldn't go through. Bitinstant told me it was Moneygrams fault and Moneygram told me it was Bitinstants fault. Needless to say I ended up getting my money back from Moneygram and have never used Bitinstant again. I like to use the cash deposit method with Bitfloor now.

I'm a newb with the bitcoin. I was just checking out Coinbase and I think I'm going to give this site a try at obtaining a vast amount of coins.

LocalTill will notify bitfloor to credit your account pretty soon after you make the cash deposit. All you have to do then is place a buy order.
@_date: 2013-03-25 03:45:44
This shit is getting real old...

Someone is putting in alot of small orders causing lag it looks like.

I bought all I could afford to from them the other day. The package was here in 2 days and they have great customer service.

If the coins were worth 50-100k I would sell one and keep the rest and my life would be changed for sure.

When I switched phones I opened bitfloor security preferences and left the page with the QR code for google auth. open until I could get the account added on my new device. You probably could do something like that next time so this kind of thing won't happen on another site.

I have very little coinage, but I just like the Idea of Bitcoin and would like to start some sort of business or something involving Bitcoin. I won't be living off my coins for a super long while. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:37:57
I requested mine yesterday. Hopefully it will come through soon.
