I'm just wondering why you would want to be known as Satoshi. Isn't that kinda dangerous?
@_date: 2015-06-01 06:44:13
I don't even think it's more complicated, as altcoins are already doing this. Just copy the idea, and set a time in the future for it to take effect (say 6 months in the future, until when everyone must have upgraded already).
@_date: 2015-06-03 11:08:37
the blockchain is stored in those files. the total file size is roughly the size of the blockchain (with some negligible overhead). back then, there was only one client implementation, so this was literally the blockchain.
but this isn't even the point. the point is that satoshi clearly said that we only needed to keep the size to a minimal in the beginning, but that it wouldn't matter anymore later.
let me add to that: it's not only that it doesn't matter, but the size must scale to the demand, and we have to make sure that Bitcoin can handle the most massive amounts of data possible. if VISA can do that, anyone can.

I believe the alts don't stand a chance because of Bitcoin's network effects. It's first-mover advantage, not necessarily superior technology or parameters. If an altcoin is doing a particular feature better, then Bitcoin can very well just copy the idea. In the end, only a few systems can win (or maybe just one). We can't take hundreds of altcoins seriously.

I guess they had an EV (extended validation) certificate before and now switched to a normal certificate. EV's are more expensive, but you get the green bar with it.

Taking $500 from me is stealing, because now you have $500 more and I have $500 less than before. Copying the password was not stealing.
Hacking into my computer to access the passwords is a crime (not related to "stealing"), not the act of copying.
Btw I don't say that copyright infringement is a good thing. Obviously plagiarism is a pathetic thing to do. It still is NOT stealing.
EDIT: Just a note as to why it is important to me to differentiate between stealing and copyright infringement: Simply because stealing is a more nefarious act. It hurts way more. Copyright infringement can be a bad thing, but is far less offensive than stealing.

It's the dot-connectors that are celebrated as the inventors. They technically didn't invent anything themselves, they just combined the right inventions together to create what will become popular.
For example Apple never invented anything, but they understood what pieces had to go together to make e.g. the iPhone or the iPad a success where predecessors failed.
For this, you need a good "big picture" vision, broad knowledge (but not necessarily deep knowledge). The scientists or engineers who effectively invent new technologies have a too narrow vision to become successful themselves, they have very deep knowledge but not broad enough. It may be tragic, but that's just the way it goes...

I'm not sure I understand everything correctly, but why doesn't an SPV wallet just maintain the public keys of the (centralized) servers that it needs to connect to, and any interaction to the server is encrypted with that public key to make sure a man-in-the-middle attack wouldn't work? What other attacks are there for these types of wallets?
@_date: 2014-03-02 12:26:44
You still need force to en-force something...
"Unregulated" means that it's a whole lot easier to get away with fraud if you don't have to fear the government coming after you. We've seen that many times in the Bitcoin community, with a ridiculous amount of con artists stealing people's money (in such a short time).
Sure we could try to come up with technological solutions instead of force, but so far they have not been effective at all. I'm not saying we can't get there, but I'm saying: We are very far from there.

Faith in the dollar (and similar fiats) went down with the financial crisis as the people were royally fucked by our beloved banks.
This royal-fucking is going to continue and will get worse until a new system rises to power in parallel and the whole house of cards collapses. There have been experts who said that the financial crisis isn't over yet ([one example here]( and why would it be, we didn't change our ways. That new system could be Bitcoin, or something else, but the old system, I believe, will not be able to evolve, so it has to collapse with a bang.
Big systems seem to always reach a certain point where sufficient evolution is nearly impossible or simply not enough, that's when only a revolution can change things (for better or worse).
So it's time for inflation-resistant, decentralized crypto-currency :)

Right, but by "consumer adoption" I mean new people buying into Bitcoin. And I believe merchants adopted more than consumers, and mostly people who already owned bitcoins purchased stuff.
Merchants seem to see more in Bitcoin than your average Joe who doesn't understand it, and is a bit scared by all the bad news (Mt.Gox imploding, etc.), and quite frankly doesn't have a problem with the current system (credit cards et al). I just haven't seen that much excitement from the consumer side (judging from news and comments over the year).
@_date: 2014-10-11 05:13:53
I totally agree. Bitcoin can become "anti-fragile" if we allow stressors and learn how to deal with the threat in general and not with one specific threat.
If Satoshi Dice is a problem, we shouldn't block Satoshi Dice directly but try to handle this problem in general.
Bitcoin is obviously still not ready for prime time, even if it is already leaking into the mainstream. That's too bad. To me, it's still an experiment, and it needs to evolve a great deal to become a viable system.

You have to elaborate on that. You cannot base "obvious troll" on this post alone.

I also know that ebay has dabbled in creating a "Virtual currency" category several months ago.

If it can be determined for certain which mining pool contributed a block, can't we change the system so that the same mining pool cannot solve 2 blocks in a row? That they always have to sit one out... 
I'm sure this sounds misinformed and naive ;) A mining pool can probably pretend to be 2 different mining pools...

But it just simply doesn't matter how the decision was made against anarchy. The decision was made with guns and they have won. That **is** a decision!
The point I'm making against anarchy is this: It CANNOT work. If there were two countries living next to each other, one in anarchy and the other in some form of hierarchy. The anarchist country will cease to exist rather quickly, because maybe the country next to it wanted to expand...
Unless you have found some kind of technology that renders guns useless and cannot be abused by a central entity, and allow us to live in anarchy, there cannot and should not be anarchy. I'm not saying that could never happen, but we are far away from it, if it's even possible.

If the block size is raised, then the blockchain also gets larger and demands more harddisk space.
Why can't we have two types of Bitcoin nodes? Full nodes that contain the entire blockchain, but they must provide enough diskspace at any time. This is not something anyone can do at home. I would call them "Archive nodes".
And every other Bitcoin node basically contains a pruned blockchain that starts with a balance sheet of all accounts from a specific time (a year back or so). And then the blockchain from that time on.
Those balance sheets would be blocks themselves, and are also contained in the Archive nodes.
This would solve the harddisk problem, and we could just raise the block size. Of course, I would also like the transaction fee to go up a bit, because we don't need all those spammy "dust" transactions. So we don't have to raise the block size too much.
Can anyone tell my why this idea isn't feasible?

I'm a little uncertain about MySQL's future, because I don't think it's in Oracle's interest to make MySQL better, they most likely want to sell more of their ridiculously expensive Oracle database..
Also what pisses me off is that certain (simple, IMO) operations are not possible in MySQL with SQL queries (like renaming or cloning a database). This is only possible with command line tools. The MySQL Java library couldn't do that ... who the hell wants to execute a shell command in their application?!

Let's think about this for a moment:
Whose interest is it that the government plays favoritism? It's in the interest of that large corporation. So how did they do it? Lobbying. The corporation is the driving force behind this favoritism, the government itself wouldn't do that otherwise. Why does the large corporation do this? Because the government has armed forces that protect the corporation's interests with the threat of violence. If the government didn't have that, the corporation wouldn't lobby and they would have their own military.
Just look at corporations that operate outside of the law, they actually do have their own military (drug lords, etc.)

Anarchy is just a temporary state of chaos where nobody successfully stepped up to take the lead. But out of any anarchic situation, groups have formed and leaders have emerged and a hierarchical society was built - because I believe this is human nature. There are leaders and followers. And you as an anarchist can't stop the followers from following that leader.
I'm not saying "we couldn't possibly win". Empires have fallen in the past, and can fall in the future. But the group that makes it happen will then take over the rule, and again: No anarchy. If you are in power, you do not give it up voluntarily, that's simply not going to happen. There will never be anarchy unless there's an enormous paradigm shift that you first have to explain to me. Will Bitcoin be a game changer? I hope so, but Bitcoin alone is not it.
With the current human nature, and the tools and everything that we have, there is no possibility for anarchy. If you just tried to conjure up anarchy by causing chaos, you'll just have that: Chaos and more suffering, but you won't have your anarchic utopia.
About "successful guerrilla campaigns": You mean the Taliban against the US military? The Taliban are not promoting anarchy, they want to rule. So where's your success story here? There are only losers in this war.

Merchants who accept bitcoins and immediately convert them to dollars (like through Bitpay or Coinbase) put pressure on the price.
I think merchant adoption has been stronger than consumer adoption, and that's why the price went down slowly. Of course, at first the price went down because it was in a bubble ($1000 was overvalued at the time).
If consumer adoption rises, then the price rises. Maybe (hopefully) it's a kind of interplay between merchant and consumer adoption, in waves: The more merchants adopt, the more consumers adopt and vice versa.

Yes, as we've seen with GHash.io, the decentralized nature of Bitcoin doesn't mean equality among the participants.
But at least it means: No single point of failure / no central attack vector. A decentralized network is way more resilient than a centralized system. BitTorrent is still impossible to shut down. Decentralization is also the answer to DoS attacks.
Let's not forget that Bitcoin is also open-source. This is important. It means transparency and the possibility for anyone with sufficient technical know-how to contribute with proposals and code contributions.

the best cold storage of bitcoin is to have multiple copies of bip38 private keys in different locations, maybe one of them your (physical) wallet. if you lose your wallet, you still haven't lost your bitcoins. if they get stolen, the thief can't use them, so you also haven't lost anything.
they are safer than the $150 cash. however, cash is more liquid than paper wallets. so you cannot really compare the two...

here's how it works for gmail:
the 2FA would only be for your browser. 
your phone (or any device linked with gmail) uses a special password that is generated by google (very long password you cannot possibly remember). you only enter that password once in your phone and it is remembered forever. basically you have to generate such a password for every device you connect with gmail.
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:03:18

Easily because Amazon has the resources. But also: It is probably even easier to implement their own solution that integrates well with their existing systems than to work with Bitpay. The integration has to be done no matter what and using Bitpay would probably make it harder. At the end of the day, Bitpay is just a piece of software to them (no offense, Bitpay :)). Bitcoin payment processing software is not very hard to write, Bitcoin itself takes care of a lot for you already.

how are they different? reddit is a forum engine - it has boards ("sub-reddits"), topics and comments. and it has additional features like up/down voting and sorting by popularity to deal with the noise, which those oldschool forums don't have. this doesn't make them a different beast to me, but an inferior beast. what do they offer that reddit doesn't?

ok you changed your comment. maybe I have to look up the term regulation now.
wasn't it the japanese government who said that they don't want to do anything about mt.gox since bitcoin is unregulated (and then later said they will look into it anyway)? are you sure regulation isn't about positive action and also punishment for non-compliance?
edit: sorry, but we seem to be splitting hairs here. there cannot be punishment without regulation. you can only break the law if there is a law. 
Regulation on Wikipedia:
1. A process of the promulgation, monitoring, and enforcement of rules, established by primary and/or delegated legislation.
2. A written instrument containing rules having the force of law.

I watch almost every Real Time show. And frankly I like his show and I agree with a lot of what he's saying, but I don't like him as a person. He hisses at his own audience when they're not applauding the second he expects it, he makes wild accusations about racism but accuses others of making baseless accusations. He is very opinionated and no, I have never seen him admit that he was wrong about something. Also he tries to make his opponents look stupid when he disagrees, not always, but enough to leave a bitter taste in your mouth. There have been enough cringe-worthy moments and I think he's getting worse and more stubborn with age.

Without alterations to the protocol, Bitcoin is not scalable and thus will fail.
I disagree that changes to the protocol are centralized, because it still requires the consensus of the Bitcoin community (miners and full nodes). A hardfork doesn't work without the consensus, and thus it's at least a democratic decision.

But seriously, I agree. With 1-minute blocks you can still wait for 50 confirmations if you want to be on the safe side, but you now have the option to trust 1 confirmation and get a faster transaction (with a little bit more trust, but we cannot eliminate trust altogether I believe).

I have small amounts in a BCI wallet. With a web wallet + phone app, those coins are available from anywhere anytime, which is very convenient.
I don't see how other web wallets are more secure than BCI, so why would I switch? They will mess up just the same or worse, because security is god damn complicated. BCI has some experience, so I hope they can handle this.
Plus, if their refund efforts are completed to the user's satisfaction, I would say that's a pretty good security feature.

You don't have to consider past blocks at all, you are raising a limit. The past blocks are automatically within that limit and thus valid.

Lots of micro payments may "bloat" the block chain. But it's probably not going to be dust like what SatoshiDice did.

In the digital age it's a little weak to come up with a new "settlement network" only, or just another commodity. Especially when the promise was "digital cash" right from the start, and everyone was excited. It is software, so it can absolutely be all of the above, all at once. We should be ready for real digital cash that can replace all existing cash and payment systems eventually.
Apparently we are not ready, yet. But the cryptocurrency world is a great testing ground for various solutions, and one will emerge victorious sooner or later. It may not be Bitcoin, I don't actually care. I keep a close eye on various cryptocurrencies.

No. You shouldn't try to win an argument by making fun of your opponent and having your own retarded fan-boy audience clap for you. He doesn't always do that, but sometimes he can't resist attacking his opponent below the belt to shut him up because he's very eloquent and knows he can win any argument with his quick wit. He's very witty but abuses that power whenever he might be losing an argument.
Right out of the play book of "Thank you for smoking": You don't have to prove that you're right, you only have to convince the audience that your opponent is wrong.

All the halvings are perfectly predictable, they were designed from the very start of Bitcoin. Miners are always calculating their profits, and they are still here. The miner's reward is actually quite strongly putting downward pressure on the price, yet the price is still going up slowly. I expect the price to explode upwards when the halving occurs, and the miners won't complain about that.

All that matters is hardfork vs. softfork. SegWit could be introduced without a hardfork, therefore it is still Bitcoin. It doesn't matter whether you or I like SegWit, or any modification that doesn't require a hardfork.
The blocksize increase in Bitcoin Cash was only possible with a hardfork, and that makes it an altcoin.
I.e. if the 8MB blocksize increase was introduced via softfork, then it would still be Bitcoin.

The name is still what bothers me. A hardfork should not result in another coin named "Bitcoin XY". This will hurt both coins. Names are important, that's why companies make sure to trademark their brand and fight off competitors who try to use the same or a similar name.

It's better than the current one, but ...
it still looks like a typical company marketing website.
Bitcoin is not a company. The website shouldn't look like that. It should simply give the user the information he seeks as fast as possible, without any fancy imagery (e.g. the giant coin). Bitcoin.org has it more right than this, whether you like the design or not.
We could also give the wealth of information that is available on bitcoin.it a new home and make it more accessible to users. Better structured, quicker way of learning about Bitcoin, but still with the possibility to dive deeper if you want to geek out.
To summarize: Information architecture is WAY more important for such a website than design.
@_date: 2015-08-20 06:21:55
Why does he keep replacing the word "test" with "attack"? As if what the Coinwallet person did was a bad thing?
I welcome ALL "attacks". For Bitcoin to succeed, it needs to be invulnerable to any and all possible attacks ever made by anyone at anytime for whatever time period and whatever reason. ANY KIND. How do some people not get that? 
Bitcoin will die a fiery death if there exists a vulnerability that couldn't be solved programmatically. It's okay if vulnerabilities exist for a limited time of course, as with any software. But those need to be exposed rather sooner than later, that's why attacks should always be welcomed.

As long as those centralized services are actually using the blockchain, it's good for Bitcoin. For me it isn't about removing the banking system entirely, but to have the option to control my bitcoins myself.
For example, I can use Circle to buy and sell bitcoins, but at any time I can move them into a cold wallet and have complete control over them, where Circle cannot touch them.
A Bitcoin cold wallet is infinitely more secure than stuffing hard cash into my mattress - that's why this is possible with Bitcoin (but not with fiat money).

Even then it would take many years to brute-force. 1000^10 is a pretty large number (assuming 10 words).
But if just one word is not in the top 1000, and someone tried to brute-force for only the top 1000, he would NEVER find the password. So logically, a brute-forcer cannot assume your words are all in the top 1000. Realistically he cannot even assume you only use words. You could throw in a number somewhere.

here's an analogy: if you want to lose weight, you are going to have to make a decision about it (that you're going to do it, when, how, etc.). once that decision is made, you have to follow through. even if at times you don't see progress (and most of the time you won't see it), you must still believe that you can do it. doubt will lead you to having to make that decision again. people who re-assess their commitment to weight-loss frequently are destined to fail.
you can schedule a re-assessment in a controlled fashion, but in-between: you must follow through *blindly* or else you are going to fail. and it's very similar in business.

I'm not sure about that. Because I think that when Bitcoin will first take off (go mainstream) it may fall flat on its face because the network really is not prepared for big demand, yet. The exchanges aren't ready, the confirmations are too slow, the blockchain would bloat like crazy, transactions would start to take ages, etc.
I have a feeling that Bitcoin could explosively go mainstream before these issues are resolved. After the storm has cleared, some people will see Bitcoin as failed. But in that time, the issues can be resolved and Bitcoin can take off once more, finally succeeding.
I personally would give it more time. Also Satoshi might not be an individual but rather a group of people, since in the whitepaper it repeatedly says "we propose", etc.

Even more secure but less liquid are paper or brain wallets (I prefer paper). This simply means that you hold bitcoins on one or more private keys that aren't stored on any computer, but offline.
By paper wallet I don't necessarily mean paper, the key could just as well be written on plastic, behind a hologram or chiseled in stone. As long as you can keep that secure, your coins are secure.
And brain wallet means you remember a long pass phrase which unlocks the private key holding your coins. This would be the best security from theft, but has some issues. First of all, that pass phrase has to be strong enough so it can't be brute-forced. But if it's strong then chances are you might not remember it one day, which would be kind of ironic.

An e-mail address is useful for the user himself, in case he forgot his username and/or password, he can then simply reset it via e-mail.
I don't have a problem with sites asking for an e-mail address, it's not like I am forced to use an e-mail address that identifies me. You can create as many e-mail addresses as you like, you can even use trash-mail / mailinator if you don't want to set up an e-mail address.

Let's say you're trying to do something illegal, like buying drugs on the Silk Road. Usually, when you buy bitcoins (e.g. via bank wire or directly from a person), you are not anonymous. So the wallet that received those bitcoins is not anonymous as well. If you just transferred some coins to a tor wallet (maybe even a few times) and then used that wallet to buy the drugs, this can easily be traced back to you. A mixing service would make it exponentially harder to trace it back. "Plausible deniability" is a term you don't even want to use, because you don't want the police knocking at your door in the first place.

There is a difference, though.
If there's a problem with Bitpay, then the customer is screwed, because the transaction did go through - and transactions are irreversible.
If the credit card terminal isn't working, there's no way your payment would go through.
The issue with Bitpay is a far bigger problem. You would have to either convince the merchant that your transaction did go through or ask for your money back, but the merchant thinks that your transaction didn't go through.

Yes I'm afraid you can only trust these sites if you have frequented bitcointalk and reddit for quite some time (or are able to audit the javascript code yourself). So this isn't for everybody. With a bit of research you can come to trust the site and then use it to gift paper wallets to friends &amp; family. I have come to the conclusion that both bitaddress.org (or at least the copy I made from a version that was deemed trustworthy) and bitcoinpaperwallet.com are trustworthy.
Hmm I haven't used Bitcoin-QT in a while (because I use paper wallets generated from bitaddress.org for my stash, and the blockchain wallet for small change) but as long as you can retrieve the private key you can make your own paper wallets from that. However, I wouldn't be comfortable with a paper wallet that also has it's private key in a wallet client. I personally want it to be completely isolated.

Well, emails have been faxed... It always requires a transition, otherwise people won't switch. But you don't have to worry of course, because these transition needs are automatically filled by some enterprise that sees the opportunity - like BitInstant does.
These efforts help Bitcoin by making it possible for regular Joes to smoothly transition to the new technology. A Bitcoin Mastercard will take away the fear of many people who think that you can't do much with bitcoins (and that fear definitely exists). The more and more you can do with them, the more people will join.
Edit: Btw there are tons of other transition efforts in the Bitcoin world. BitPay. Pizza for coins, BitSpend, etc. If you removed all the transition efforts for Bitcoin, I don't think Bitcoin would ever be widely adopted.

Deterministic wallets!
You only have to backup your wallet once ever with Armory (and you can back it up on paper as well). With BitcoinQT you have to backup your wallet regularly, every 100 transactions or so - which is really inconvenient.
edit: also neat feature: instead of importing other private keys, simply use Armory's "sweep private key" feature to automatically transfer all funds from that private key into your wallet, discarding the private key. This is useful e.g. if you buy loaded keys from btcquick and the likes.

Also, Bitcoin is currently scam-city as well, and thus very scary, especially for internet-illiterate people. Every other bitcoin-related business that opens is a scam. This is frustrating, and we will need more regulation in the future.

"satoshis" should never be officially used IMO. You can introduce slang and call it that if you like, nobody's stopping you.
But the metric system is easier to understand, and they're called bitcoins and anything else would be confusing. So why not centi, milli, micro, nano?
Also, if the 8 decimal limit would be lifted, what are you going to call those units then? Are you going to introduce centi-satoshis then, or redefine what a satoshi is? That gets messy.

Bitcoin has a tiny economy.
Why can't you accept that it's a logical step to provide a Bitcoin Mastercard or VISA to get a ton of reluctant people to join in. It doesn't matter whether you like credit cards or not, but this is going to happen anyway. If not BitInstant, then someone else.
Because in the business world, transitions are always necessary. Maybe individuals can radically switch to a new technology, but businesses can't and won't. That's why Internet Explorer 6 stayed relevant for so damn long. The business world requires transitions or it won't update, period.
Edit: Another perfect example for a transition is BitPay. Merchants have an easier time accepting bitcoins if they are converted to fiat money instantly. Then after some time they might retain some bitcoins. Then at some point they might even decide to keep all bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-02-01 09:55:16
I thought about that, too. Inheriting riches seems kinda unfair anyway, since you haven't earned that yourself.

"Help" from politicians would definitely not be a bad thing. They would only cause harm if they were against it, but if they are on Bitcoin's side, the ride will be a lot smoother. We don't need help per se, but the absence of a "war on bitcoin" I would certainly appreciate.
Nobody knows if Bitcoin could be stopped if one or multiple governments **REALLY** tried. There are possible attack vectors, like the 51% take-over, CoinValidation, banning exchanges, ATMs and businesses who deal in bitcoins. They probably couldn't stop underground usage of Bitcoin, but they can attack anyone with an identity, and that's still a potential threat.
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:16:28
Of course I know what it means. But the Bitcoin price is determined by supply and demand, there is noone controlling it.
If you want to force a slow, steady rise you would need some central planner that artificially stabilizes the currency, as they do with fiat currencies. Which is what most people here are against.

Well... we do have to be careful and stay vigilant, because the concentration of power can still happen and will get harder and harder to undo.
For example politicians are all about figuring out how they can change a policy just slightly so that the vast majority of people will not get upset (or not upset enough). Then wait some time, and change the policy further and so on. This is how we can lose more and more rights and not even notice it.
And this happens not just in politics.

"The point of Bitcoin is that you don't need to trust others."
This is really not true, you need more trust than e.g. with a credit card, as a consumer. Chargebacks favor you as a consumer - if you're being scammed, you can simply get your money back, no big deal. If you send bitcoins to a scammer, you will never get them back.
However, for businesses bitcoin is clearly better, as they can't be scammed with chargebacks. So it's really a question of who should be protected more.
If a business provides real-life identity, contact information, is registered and verified, *then* I think that they should be protected more than the anonymous individual, making bitcoin the ideal payment solution.

they have little reason to do that; the USD (and every other fiat currency) is already electronic with e-banking, credit cards, etc.
what properties of bitcoin would they want to implement? peer to peer? certainly not, they would want it centralized. cryptography? well cryptography is already used when doing e-banking, but a currency based on cryptography, what for? bitcoin uses cryptography so that only the owner of the coins can control them, noone else. this is certainly not in any government's interest. anonymity? well of course :)
I think there are 2 properties they would actually want to copy from bitcoin: the public ledger and thus the complete traceability of *every* transfer ever made, but with zero anonymity. and lower transaction fees. other than that I don't see the point.

So you actually envision a future where we won't have the internet anymore, or no access to it? Even if the dollar collapses, that doesn't mean it has to affect the internet.

Finally: My livelihood depends on the internet. If it seizes to exist, I seize to exist. So that scenario doesn't really matter to me, as it would mean harakiri.

it's hard to be and stay anonymous with bitcoin, though. if you put up a bitcoin address for donations on your website, then people see exactly how many donations you received. and if you are not careful and transact to your other addresses, people can ultimately figure out how much money you have, and from then on see every transaction you are making.
also, the exchanges can track your bitcoins easily, because they have your ID and can track to which addresses you withdraw your bitcoins. if a government comes knocking at exchanges' doors to find out about the transactions of an individual they are looking for, they can get that information even easier than from banks I guess.
already popular addresses are identified and more and more will be. there will at some point be a search engine where you can enter a company's or even individual's name and it shows you all the known associated addresses.
mhmm... governments should actually LOVE bitcoin ;)

no, the thing is: I use Armory as a client, which has deterministic wallets and have a backup of that on paper. But this is still an online wallet, so it's vulnerable to viruses and such, so it doesn't hold much coin. Using Bitcoin-QT alone would be a pain since you have to backup that wallet.dat file every 100 transactions or so, which I can't be bothered to do.
I have the bulk of my coins on paper wallets, i.e. private keys printed on paper (and backed up in other secure places as well). They are completely offline and I never touch them unless I would want to liquidise some of it. That's for storage only, not spending.

If you only use Bitcoin as a speculative commodity for trading, then making a &gt;1000% profit is certainly nice.
But if you want Bitcoin to succeed, you have to look at this as a long-term investment, which means that you ultimately want to stay in forever (after all, Bitcoin is supposed to be a currency and a payment system, not a commodity). There is never a reason to fully "cash out". Well, only if it is clear that Bitcoin has failed for good. But if you believe in the future of cryptocurrencies and especially Bitcoin, why would you ever fully get out? Like Plumbum27 said above: Never go full fiat. By the way, this is always good advice regardless of Bitcoin.

You don't know that and so you shouldn't assume it. The logical assumption is: The reseller is a separate company. Mega accepts USD only, therefore the reseller likely pays Mega in USD. Anything else is just wishful thinking. I know it's seductive to think like that, but we shouldn't succumb to wishful thinking..

look at the transaction on blockchain.info, it will probably answer your question.
e.g. Armory always sends the whole balance of an address, sends a part to the recipient, and the rest back to you. you have to wait for at least 1 confirmation until that money becomes available to spend again.

I think there is a flaw in the scope insensitivity theory. If we are trying to save 200'000 birds, then we're going to ask a lot of people to chip in. As many as we can. So each person's contribution actually doesn't have to be that large, we are supposed to carry the burden together. You cannot ask one person alone to save those birds.
On the other hand, if we are trying to save 20 birds, we are only going to ask a couple of people. It would be silly to ask the entire nation to help out. But this means that these few people each have to contribute more (or at least equally as much) than they would have to save the 200'000 birds.
Edit: Also, you are usually donating an amount according to your means, not an amount according to the need of the recipient.

(see [Contact us](
Also they have several verification tiers. Without verification, you cannot deposit, trade or withdraw. But the first tier of verification only asks for your real name, birthdate, country of residence and phone number. The 2nd tier asks for your address, not even verifying it. With the 2nd tier you already have a daily deposit/withdraw limit of $2000, which should be enough for most people. Only if you want higher limits, you have to provide ID, etc.

yes but no matter how sure you are about it being overpriced, you don't know that. so it's risky to sell all of it. 
i understand that while you believe in bitcoin you are selling all so you can later buy back in at a lower price. but people got burned about that before when they thought that bitcoins were overpriced at $30, sold, and then bitcoin marched on to $100 never looking back. if you only did that with, say, 50% of your bitcoins, you couldn't get burned this hard and still make a nice gain when you are right about your prediction.

Isn't that what the "confirmations" are? If the difficulty was halved, then the approx. time for each confirmation would be 5mins instead of 10mins, right? With the current hardcoded variables we say that it requires 6 confirmations to be sure. Then of course the consequence would be that it requires 12 confirmations instead, to be absolutely sure.
But 1 confirmation is still way better than 0 confirmations. This is what I'm getting at... Even if 1 confirmation would then be less trust-worthy than 1 confirmation is now, it's still an order of magnitude more secure than 0 confirmations, is it not?
I guess the hardcoded variables have been thought-out, yes. But I simply don't understand them..

Only the bot-detection and rejection server-side works (but not perfectly, since not every bot has the word "bot" or such in its name, they can easily fake the user-agent). Telling robots to not index/crawl (via robots.txt or meta-tags) only works on honest bots like the one from Google. Malicious bots couldn't care less.
The best solution is anyway to never post e-mail addresses online. Just use a contact form instead, where it's a little easier to protect against bots.

I was talking about judgements of other people. We judge others automatically, whether we know it or not.
What I mean is that when you judge someone else purely on his motives (selfish or selfless) it's a poor assessment of that person. Like you say, everything could ultimately be seen as selfish, so the motive alone is not enough. Why do we judge people? Well, there are very good reasons: Is this person trustworthy? Is this person a threat? Of course, in general it's better to not judge too quickly.
You always have options. If a merchant repeatedly opts for the win/lose outcome, e.g. by trying to sell you a shitty product for lots of money, then this merchant is to be avoided. If a merchant opts for win/win, selling you a quality product for an adequate price, that's a lot better and I couldn't care less about his motives.

That's not true. Not from every country, not to every country. There's lots of blacklisted countries, there's lots of unbanked and underbanked people in this world that cannot send or receive cash. And banks can simply stop your transactions at will, they can freeze your accounts, extort enormous fees, etc. You may not notice this in a first world country. 
Banks even charge you for not having enough money ([watch this](
Bitcoin is only hard to access from a technical understanding standpoint (yes, the concept is still hard to grasp for a lot of people), but it is accessible to anyone with access to the internet, and most people, even in third-world countries have access to the internet somehow.
Once you have bitcoins, there are no restrictions. You can send bitcoins from anywhere to anyone globally, with the lowest fees possible (or even no fees if you can wait a little).

if someone pitched an idea to me, that i think people might actually buy and it could even succeed, but i hate it - i will not invest. find someone else, because i want you to fail, i don't want this to be "a thing" in the future.
if you invest this way, you most likely have no regrets. if it succeeds without you, you stood by what you believe, you basically took a vote. if you invest in crap you don't even like, you are shaping a future that you are going to dislike. this type of behaviour spells doom for mankind.

This is not a good world. If the community splits in two, with 2 blockchains going on, then everyone could potentially spend their coins twice (at least for a while). That's insane. Why should a merchant accept coins in one of the 2 blockchains if it could whither and die in a few months which basically means he loses everything he earnt there? If suddenly exchange sites refuse to convert these coins to anything, he'll be fucked.
Besides, I believe the major exchange sites have a lot of power in this. If they collectively decide to only support one of the two chains, the other one will die a quick death, as people will have a very hard time exchanging those coins to anything else. I personally would go where the exchange sites go, and the merchants will follow, and so will everyone else.
I believe a split could have very negative consequences on the faith in Bitcoin. What I mean is this: If there is a hard fork, but the victorious new chain is already clear - then it's a smooth transition, and the few nutjobs holding onto that other chain, well who cares about them.. But if the community splits like 50/50 over some major disagreements on how to move forward - that would be catastrophic.

1. go to [bitaddress.org]( this auto-generates new wallets for you. it's all javascript, so if you don't trust them, just download the website html and run it on an offline pc.
2. wait until it generated some keys
3. go to "paper wallet"
4. print this on paper
5. send BTC to the public key (on the left)
6. store them in a safe place
the private key on the right you can later use to import the coins into an online wallet (e.g. Armory) for when you want to spend them. I would split the coins into several paper wallets, basically like printing your own bank notes.
EDIT: if you trust your own memory, you can also create a brain wallet, which would be safer from theft but an issue if you forget the passphrase. you can also do this on bitaddress.org..

that's sadly true... there doesn't seem to be enough exchanges to make it easier to buy bitcoins. ironically the only reason why exchanges make it so hard to buy bitcoins is because of existing banks and AML / tax laws. the very thing bitcoin tries to free us from makes it hard to get into it.
and then up-and-comer exchanges like [Kraken]( simply don't get noticed here. it's actually easy to get bitcoins there with little verification for a deposit/withdrawal limit of $2000. I just hope they don't shut down because nobody notices them.

violence can't be the root of all evil as it's usually not the goal itself. also money is never the goal, since money alone is useless if it's never spent.
it's .... drumroll... the striving for power and control, and the desire to stay in power, no matter what.
violence and money are just part of evil's toolbox.

Yes. As I live in the EU, I do all my exchanges through BitStamp and it's absolutely hassle-free and cheap. I can recommend it, especially if you live in the EU, i.e. the SEPA zone.
Without SEPA, however, a deposit via bank wire would cost $15, so it wouldn't be viable for small transactions.

the minimum is $20, but you can pay whatever you want per day and your ad gets the appropriate time share depending on the total amount spent that day for ads.
e.g. if all ads together spent $200 for a day, and you spent $20, your ad is shown 10% of the time.
I don't know the realistic numbers, however.

"fiat lux" means "let there be light" (latin)

Silver and gold are only useful for storage of value but not as a currency.

The issue is, though, that most people are not familiar with accounting, but everyone understands the concept of coins, currency, cash. I guess that's why they are called Bitcoin. And the main reason for adopting Bitcoin is to use them as a currency to buy goods and services. The accounting concept is interesting, too, but secondary to the primary use.
There is so much to say about Bitcoin, you could dive deep into cryptography, etc. but for communicating the concept to newbies you have to start with the basics, and on common ground. You can always go into more detail as long as the person seems interested.

alright, I guess the correct term would be Ponzi scheme then.
From Wikipedia:
"A Ponzi scheme is a fraudulent investment operation that pays returns to its investors from their own money or the money paid by subsequent investors, rather than from profit earned by the individual or organization running the operation. The Ponzi scheme usually entices new investors by offering higher returns than other investments, in the form of short-term returns that are either abnormally high or unusually consistent. Perpetuation of the high returns requires an ever-increasing flow of money from new investors to keep the scheme going."

Can someone tell me why it would be better to raise the block size limit than to simply decrease the difficulty, resulting in the blocks being processed faster? 
Faster processed blocks would also mean more transactions per second, but with the added bonus of faster confirmations, which Bitcoin would need anyway if it should be used for processing payments in brick&amp;mortar stores. I am not too fond of the 10min wait for a single confirmation. 
Also, some have raised concerns that a higher block size limit would make it harder for smaller miners to compete, resulting in centralization. So a decreased difficulty should make it even easier for smaller miners to compete, if I understand that correctly.
Can someone enlighten me?

You don't know what the other exchanges would have done if they were as big as Mt.Gox. Of course the others had less issues because they have less traders on them.

There is no need for stronger crypto for Bitcoin private keys, it's ridiculously strong and cannot be brute forced.
But brain wallets are different, because you generate the private key from a deterministic pass phrase that you choose yourself. Noone can stop you from doing that. And if you choose a weak pass phrase, then your wallet is easily brute-forced. But this would be your own fault.

People who buy bitcoins now do so because they believe in Bitcoin's future. They are early adopters / investors. And if they are right, and a few years from now you can buy anything with bitcoins, they are handsomely rewarded for it. Patience is important, because I believe that a technology like this cannot mature fast. We have to go through all the growing pains, it's a paradigm shift in currency, not Facebook.
Of course you can just wait it out like the rest of the world and buy bitcoins only once they cross a threshold of usefulness. That's the safe road. You can't get burned that way, but you might miss out on an incredible investment opportunity.
Study Bitcoin (read EVERYTHING about it) and decide for yourself whether it has a future or not. Just like you would with a stock of a promising company. Knowledge is key. Then it's a simple YES or NO. If you can't make up your mind, regrets will follow.

The &gt;50% attack is a real concern and must be solved in some way before Bitcoin becomes mainstream.
It's really simple: If any of the largest governments decides to kill Bitcoin, all they have to do is buy enough specialty hardware to take over the network. Remember they can print money so they can buy/create as many as they want.
But if the block chain would then fork, it would create panic and destroy people's faith in Bitcoin (and also the new Bettercoin). If this system becomes mainstream, you cannot allow it to split anymore, you would have a huge mess.
So I'm definitely concerned about that..

I don't think so. A majority of jobs are repetitive and not innovative. Yes, you need maintenance, but 1 person can manage multiple robots, which will have replaced dozens of jobs.
Jobs for humans will be more and more qualified, for which you have to be well trained. Anyone can work at McDonalds with very little training, but not everyone can be a doctor. Not saying that I want to see that, but theoretically a McDonalds restaurant could be 99% automated with maybe 1 human manager. 
And let's face it: There will always be humans that are not able to do highly qualified work (for whatever reason), and for them it will be harder and harder to find work with increased automation.

I personally wouldn't trade Bitcoin. I believe in its future due to its unique properties, so I invested some money and I'm going long. Long, as in: Years. I don't buy and sell Bitcoins as it goes up and down, so the volatility doesn't affect me.
If people are trading Bitcoins, then yes they are speculating, but then it's their own risk, and believe me: They have been warned many many times. Any day-trader / speculator has to really know what they're doing, which I suspect most of them don't anyway. Speculators are more like gamblers to me.
Edit: This is the same advice as Warren Buffet would give to stock holders: Invest only in a company that you truly believe in and then hold for years, don't trade.
@_date: 2013-11-14 22:10:33

no the point is to switch to mBTC for a while (and I guess it will suffice for a couple of years) and then at some point switch to µBTC. I don't think we will have a problem with these switches. And to be honest, that's what is going to happen naturally anyway. I just don't see anyone being able to force any other notation onto the public.

One big difference between a brain wallet and a password manager is that you can brute-force a brain wallet without any access to a file or anything, you are basically brute-forcing ALL the brain wallets in existence. (or to put it another way: you are *mining* stupid wallets)
To brute force the encrypted file of a password manager, you would first have to get hold of that file, which is a big hurdle. And then I would say it's about the same, of course depending on what encryption the password manager uses.

How do you expect a new currency like Bitcoin to be stable at this point? It's not possible. With wider adoption comes stability, this is still in its infancy.

This is not exactly true. If you buy something, the VAT is already included in the price. It's the seller that has to pay the VAT. There is no additional sales tax.
The difference between VAT and sales tax is that you receive back the VAT on your expenses, thus only paying a tax on added value, not on sales.

I'd rather see mixing features built into the software without having to trust a third-party. Because many mixing sites so far were scams, you cannot trust them. You're basically sending someone else your coins and hope they send it back to you. And nobody is going to protect you in this case (certainly no government).

if you're just thinking about short-term, then you are at a high risk, as the bitcoin price is very volatile. just like it got up to $100, it could easily drop back to $50 in a matter of weeks or even days. the 2011 bubble showed that. it may or may not happen, noone can tell. so a short-term investment is too risky.
long-term, however, it looks different. if you believe that bitcoin will become widely adopted within the next few years, then the bitcoin price must go up ... a lot. like $1000's of dollars. I suggest you don't trade bitcoins, i.e. day-trading, but instead hold on to them and buy stuff with bitcoins when you need it.

To differentiate between selfish or selfless is the wrong approach. It's not that relevant. It makes more sense to look at what the consequences of people's action are. Is it win/win, win/lose, lose/lose etc.
There are definitely people who opt more for a win/win solution if they have the choice. Which is better for everyone, and thus trying to figure out whether this person acted selfish or selfless doesn't matter.

"realized gains" doesn't apply to a potential currency. if bitcoin succeeds, your gains are already realized while holding bitcoins, no need to "cash out". people don't seem to understand this difference. if you can pay for pretty much anything in bitcoins, why would you go through the trouble of exchanging them to us dollars?

You would first have to check if the AppStore even allows to use an alternative payment system for in-app purchases. We already know that Apple and Google are evil, so they might have included something like that in their endless terms &amp; conditions.
If it's allowed or not legally possible to forbid, then I think there could be a market for it as app developers could bypass the standard fee this way.

Second Life is a video game and thus always a fad. People aren't going to play that forever, even if it was a very open world. The developers would not be able to keep up adding new features to combat declining interest. Though an open world, it's still very limited and will never match reality. Even the best video game in the history of mankind will fade away after some time (sure, really good games will still be played by nostalgic nerds for years to come).
Bitcoin is not a game, it's a potentially revolutionary currency, payment system and secure store of value. It's value doesn't lie in entertainment but in utility.
Also, people have a stake in Bitcoin, be it merchants who accept bitcoins as payment, users who own bitcoins and especially businesses built on Bitcoin itself. They won't give up this easily, because the collapse would have more consequences the more Bitcoin rises. With Second Life, you simply stop playing and caring. That's not so easy with Bitcoin, I think.

since you have to pay rent and taxes with fiat money, and that's unlikely to change in the near future, most of your income should be converted to fiat money as soon as possible to not be affected by the volatility of the bitcoin conversion rate.

actually the word "never" is married to the word "believe", your belief in bitcoin's future. of course i say "believe" and not "knowledge" because you cannot possibly predict the future, but i am not speaking about blind belief. you still have to do a ton of research and watch the news articles, understand the fundamentals, etc.
the point i'm trying to make, is, if you believed in a company, you wouldn't buy stock for speculation. you would hold their stock forever, or at least for a very long time. this is what warren buffett is trying to teach people, and the world doesn't seem to get it. you don't dip your toes in, you don't go in and out, no you invest yourself into what you believe in. if at some point you are convinced that the company failed and cannot succeed anymore, that's where you get out and never look back.

"Just trust the math!"
errr.. you do realize that the mathematical algorithm doesn't come from a fairy, it indeed was written by a programmer and its rules are based on the ideology of that programmer. math is a tool that can be used right, wrong, good, evil, dumb and smart or any other way.
and ironically with bitcoin it is a sort of committee that decides if and how the algorithms are changed. yes, it's democratic and their decision has to be ultimately accepted by the majority of the bitcoin network. but it's still a committee that makes these decisions, everyone else is just a spectator.
i agree that an open source protocol is less likely to be tampered with in a bad way (though we will still have to see), but let's not kid ourselves here, it's still politics.

If Bitcoin succeeds there is absolutely no reason to "cash out" because then you could buy anything directly with bitcoins. I wouldn't want the dollars then. (edit: so I don't really like your premise because you are forcing me to sell the bitcoins no matter what)
If Bitcoin fails, they will be worthless and you will not be able to ask for high prices.
I figure 15 years is long enough to find out whether Bitcoin has succeeded or not. And I define success by: Being able to pay for anything including rent, with the only exception being taxes maybe. But probably even taxes by then.

there is a difference between SatoshiDICE (which is pure gambling, everything else stripped away) and casinos, which are also a social place where you go with your friends, have a drink, etc.
gambling alone is absolutely boring, that's why it's surprising to me that SatoshiDICE is so successful.

Most likely. The QR code is a big red flag for me. I can't believe people actually send bitcoins to that address. Scams are so fricken easy here...

Why has noone created buttcoin yet? Maybe the operator of [buttcoin.org]( should do it :)

The NSA was somewhat successful in that they have put a backdoor into closed-source encryption libraries in Windows, Mac, and what-not. Anything encrypted with these libraries can be easily decrypted by the NSA. This is some scary shit..

The plural of coin is coins.
As has been discussed many times on this subreddit: The system is called Bitcoin while the units are called bitcoins.

But you do know that e-mail addresses should never be posted online, anywhere, right? If you absolutely have to publish an e-mail address, you have to use tricks with JavaScript and the likes to make sure e-mail addresses can't be retrieved from the html source, otherwise hello spam and bye bye e-mail account. And I believe hex encoding doesn't cut it.
It's not just about the robots.txt file, because malicious bots of course ignore these.
Btw, this seems to work fine: Put a placeholder in the html source and replace it with the actual e-mail address via JavaScript. Yes, you have to jump through hoops to display an e-mail address.

oh I thought you made multiple suggestions... ok that's better then.. 
I'm still not convinced about the brainwallet idea in general. Simply because: The easier it is to remember, the easier to brute-force. And the harder to remember, the more likely you lose your coins just by forgetting the pass phrase.
You'll end up writing it down on paper, but then you might as well have created a paper wallet from a private key, which is impossible to brute-force.
You could make up fancy riddles and write those on paper, but that's just a little silly :)

oh my god, MPEx is the geekiest stock exchange I've ever seen. you have to send commands via command line? no web interface?

But WIR money has failed IMO, it exists since a long time and you can't do much with that currency. It's useless..
I would never join that. If Bitcoin is still the same in 5 years, I will declare it as failed as well. But I'm positive that it won't...

isbn number - bad idea for a brainwallet. anything that is public knowledge should not be used.
brute forcers could easily go through a table of millions of isbn numbers, and if a few people followed your advice, their coins are gone!

Armory, for my pocket money. And various e-wallets, just for testin' it all out for fun. But my vast riches are on paper wallets :) So I don't need much security for Armory, as it doesn't contain much money.
Armory requires Bitcoin-QT to run, but has deterministic wallets and thus only needs a one time backup.

I am not sure that's true. If the government allows the payment of their taxes in bitcoins, then they could connect that address to all your other addresses, unless you use a mixing service. But wouldn't it be easy for them to ban mixing services? (with AML laws) Isn't it easily identifiable if a mixing service was used? They could punish you if they detect that.

The bitaddress.org project was discussed here:
It exists since September 12, 2011. It has been reviewed by others (including casascius for example who spotted bugs in the code in earlier versions).
Seems pretty safe to me.
