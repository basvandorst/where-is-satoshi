A T1 isn't that fast.  Plenty of people have high speed broadband.  Most users don't need to run a full node anyways.  I don't see what the problem is.  It looks like there shouldn't be a problem with scaling based on modern technology.

What would prevent you from running a full node?  Even with big blocks you should be able to do so with a decent internet connection and a PC with a large hard drive.  4TB drives are about $120 now.   Have at it!

Not really.  The entire concept is that Bitcoin Cash adheres to Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper and who's blockchain starts with the genesis block.   Bitcoin is a peer to peer electronic cash system, not a store of value.  This is why Bitcoin Cash proponents call it the true Bitcoin, they're not trying to trick anyone.

"The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale. That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server. The design supports letting users just be users. The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be. Those few nodes will be big server farms. The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don’t generate."  - Satoshi Nakamoto

Only one block is mined at a time.  The first miner to successfully mine it wins the reward.  The next block is available for mining approximately 10 minutes later.  All miners are trying to mine the same block.   There is no way to mine a specific block.

Nobody's saying to switch to 1GB blocks right now.  This is just a demonstration that we can do so when it's needed.  By the time it's needed the technology will be much cheaper than it currently is and more players can run full nodes.

How much bandwidth is required?  High speed internet should suffice.  Network speeds are improving all the time.  Regular users don't need to run full nodes.  This is a non issue.

You are correct, however "not 5 minutes ago" usually implies "not more than 5 minutes ago".  I can see someone thinking that he claims to have received the TV less than 5 minutes ago and also claims to have had a 30 minute conversation.  That's kind of confusing, or unbelievable.

If he was Satoshi why wouldn't he just sign a message using a bitcoin known to be owned by Satoshi rather than all the smoke and mirrors he showed the media?
@_date: 2016-06-21 18:12:18
The coins known to belong to Satoshi haven't moved, ergo not taxable.  If CW is Satoshi and needs to pay a tax bill, he could easily sell some coin to pay the bill.  
The R&amp;D tax credit has no connection to Satoshi, just CW.  It doesn't prove he is Satoshi.
CW asked Jon Matonis and Gavin Andresen to send a small amount of bitcoins to an address known to be linked to Nakamoto. He would then send it back, proving his claims to the identity. The money was sent but never returned.
His behavior is bizarre.  For someone claiming to be Satoshi he sure isn't making it easy to believe him. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 11:04:16
What kind of demands can the Australian tax authorities make on him if he is Satoshi?  Taxes aren't owed on gains until they are made, meaning any gains made on BTC are only taxable once the BTC is sold.    
I believe he was involved with Bitcoin from early on, but doubt he's Satoshi.

With bigger block BCH has lower fees.  With lower fees come more applications and users.  With more applications and users comes more value.  More value brings more miners.  More miners brings more decentralization.   
In the meantime, let's enjoy the swings.  Buy low, sell high!
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:07:42
Consider this.  What if the developers and big guys are holding BTC back for personal gain?   Satoshi put the 1MB block limit in place as a TEMPORARY solution.  This limit is not a hard and fast rule, it is adjustable depending on what's required.  Computing power, storage, and networking is and has been improving year after year.  This was taken into consideration when Satoshi Nakamoto created bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:12:10
1TB is not very expensive. Storage space is getting cheaper and faster on a regular basis.   Your argument doesn't hold up.

I don't think these high fees can last.   People are paying the high fees because they have FOMO and no other choice.   High fees negate the ability to purchase things.   Why have high fees when we don't have to?  I guess we will see how things pan out.  Enjoy your high fees.

That's not how taxes work.  One is taxed on profits or income. The taxes are calculated on the value they are sold for not on what they're worth on whatever day the tax office feels like using. 
 When the real Nakamoto mined coins they were worth very little, today they are worth a lot.  The tax office can't pick and choose which value to tax on.

I bought my first BTC today using the blockchain app to receive.  Then when I got home I sent it to the wallet on my PC.  I displayed the QR code on my monitor, scanned it with my iPhone using blockchain, and sent it from the iPhone.  Seems as though the app can be used for sending.
On a side note I did have to pay a small fee though which I believe was because the BTC was being transferred quickly from one wallet to another.  From what I've just read, bitcoin fees are structured to prevent spam transactions from crashing the system.  I assume if I waited a while to transfer there would have been no fees.

I believe you can write off the depreciation on the equipment. You still have an asset on your books. The rate depends on where you live. 
For example in Canada they have a 20% depreciation per year. So if the rig cost $10,000 the write off would be $2,000 the first year, $1600 the second. If you sell the equipment you can write off the difference.
