Agreed. Next 6-9 days we likely hit a low around \~5780 and then start climbing. September and October should be big months and then November and December a new frenzy. I consulted with my inner self.

Yeah it's pretty confusing humor. I think Harvard is hosting a talk on the "My other car is a ..." bumper sticker meme. You should check it out as it might help shed some light.

There's some big time egos behind and supporting bitcoin core as well. That won't and haven't backed down. BU's attack may return with focus on forking their own turd as opposed to trying to destroy core. Them having success with their own ideas would represent the ultimate win. But undisciplined bullying will always lose when you enter the ring with a bigger bully. Core is the bigger bully.

actual quote: "The majority decision is represented by the longest chain, which has the greatest proof-of-work effort invested in it"
shallow interpretation: "it means that BU is Bitcoin and Core is altcoin"
How will BU enforce adoption of the name "bitcoin" to the chain that the vaste majority of people refuse to call bitcoin?
If people, exchanges, services etc. continue calling the shorter chain "Bitcoin" what will BU do? Cry? Tell Satoshi?

don't bring on anyone. develop the incentive for developers to develop into the protocol. What is there incentive right now? Get paid by other people? It doesn't work.

Let's review the trust as well:
In the pool, the finder is the only one who has access to the findings.
What does this mean? If i wanted to create FUD against bitcoin and in the encryption it uses i could potentially distribute some fake findings among the peers. Is there a way to inject or push fake findings to random peers? There's real incentive to do this. Increase findings, short bitcoin. 
While keeping the finder private and not sharing with all peers we are simply trusting the pool/project operator or even a nefarious peer(s) that the findings are legitimate. 
I haven't reviewed the code itself by it's likely no one is spending a lot of time reviewing it. If this gets more attention then people will spend more time debunking it (whether true or not) and the fact that findings are held only by the finder is the weakness. Why not generate an address and push a fake find message back into the network?
As it stands I don't see why anyone can trust these results. That doesn't mean they aren't legitimate.. But OP seems to be whining about people questioning their motives and the results. A simple solution for increasing trust would be to openly distribute the findings to all peers. The same way mining pools work.

Most people understand that what is implied is utter BS. Even without adequate technical discernment the giveaway is the last sentence:


Like that would be a consideration by anyone other than the patent owners. 
hey core i need some money this weekend. Can you tweak something and put out a really positive statement on Thursday so i can sell some BTC? It's for the children.

doesn't really matter how obvious they are at this point. They flat out say:
"Gregory Maxwell’s recent proposal suggests changing 2^32 collision to 2^64 collision to make ASICBOOST more difficult. The result of this would be a loss for the patent owners and the Bitcoin protocol. The patent owners will get nothing and Bitcoin protocol will become more complicated. "
haha. If they address the POW issue our patent won't be worth anything!! Wahhhh. Hey if the price of bitcoin goes down because they are blocking segwit Wahhhhh say every single holder of BTC. And rightfully so. Honestly, what choice do they have other than to plead their failed case.
First they tried to TAKE a bailout and now they are pleading for one. They need a bailout because their business sucks.
