I don't understand your comment. People adding services around the block chain/ bitcoin  can only help improve value/ usefulness.

They do both, when they have the coins on hand the price is locked. But if you just want to place an Order they will peg it to closing price.

"Whether cybercriminals can find a way to make Bitcoin more useful remains to be seen. But in the short term, it is unlikely to fill the void left by Liberty Reserve."
I think if they start running out of options they will make it work, so to speak.

Agreed, you want dedicated macines running the show efficiently.

It always has been difficult with coinbase. I had luck in the middle of the night. You can go risky with the option to order market price at close 5 business days from now.

"While I don't think it is headed to 0, I can see the price dropping to around $4 in the near future and maybe a little more than that. There will still be enough demand to keep the price from going extremely low"
Not much has changed. 
I wanted to do the same with r/bitcoin posts , but my reddit-fu is lacking.

I am glad they got the Krugman quote in there. 
@_date: 2013-05-31 10:56:00
Apparently without irony Calvery said: “I actually heard the CEO of a bank say recently that there is a reason that financial institutions have to obtain licenses and to register. And that’s because it is a great bestowal of trust to the bankers, to the financial service providers, to be able to be part of the U.S. financial system, to be able to be part of the global financial system. And that trust and that privilege come with obligations.”
Funniest paragraph.
