It can scale to VISA proportions with the lightning network. Increasing block size is not necessary for the lightning network to function, whereas if you wanted to scale by having larger blocks, you'd need blocks of several GB to scale to VISA proportions. Scaling-by-blocksize-increase quickly would become unsustainable.

Time and diffusion. As more people hear about it, more people buys some, resulting in a supply shortage (which will gets more severe with time), resulting in a price rise, resulting in more people hearing about it...
The way I see it, we've just found a new kind of shells that's more scarce, more convenient to use and harder to forge than any kind of shells we used before, and our tribe (mankind) is slowly transitioning to it. We're at the early stage of the transition.

Realistically speaking, we can easily get to a $1T market capitalisation, just by eating a third of Gold's use as a store of value. This would be roughly $50 000 a bitcoin.
If it's used as a worldwide currency, replacing the dollar, it could get to $10 trillions - this would be $500 000 a bitcoin, but if this were to happen there wouldn't be any dollars to trade bitcoins for; a bitcoin would just as the same purchasing power as $500 000 would have.

It's actually the opposite, Bitcoin's value depends on its qualities as a reserve of value for investors, much more than on its use as a mean of paiement for day-to-day purchases. $0.2 or even $1 fees are ok in this optic. I mean, millions of people and plenty of institutional investors currently use gold as a store of value, and the transaction fees on gold are much higher.
Besides, scaling bitcoin to the same kind of throughput as the centralised VISA and Mastercard would require 16 or 32GB blocks, for a chain that would be in the PB (Petabytes) range. Obviously this is not doable with current technology, and it would require some pretty huge technological improvements, unless you want all the mining to occur in massive datacenters that can be easily located, audited and coerced by governments. So scaling will imply some measure of offchain scaling anyway.

In all seriousness, if bitcoin catches on as a store of value alone (we're not even talking of fully replacing fiat here), we're talking of eating a good chunk of the $3T of gold as an investment. $1T in bitcoins is $50 000 a coin, making any one with a few dozen coins a millionaire.

You don't understand how a soft fork works. Blocks from the remaining non-upgraded miners are orphaned (ie the 95% other mienrs do not build on top of them), instead the 95% build on top of blocks that respect the soft fork; since it's a soft fork (ie a restricting of the consensus rule, not a loosening), the post-soft-fork blocks are valid by the consensus rules of the old nodes, for whom this is the valid chain.
What BU advocates for is building useless blocks that are empty or full of spam on top of the minority blocks, to make the minority chain unusable.

It would also be good to implement SegWit quickly (via UASF if need be) on the minority chain, so at least we allow the minority chain to innovate faster (through LN, Schnorr signatures etc).
I guess that after a fork, there would be no serious opposition to it from the community of the minority chain, since most of the current opposition (Bitmain and Roger) would be gone.

You shouldn't have invested in futures with her money, just in a couple of coins in cold storage.
I feel like a lot of people are investing in bitcoin in a way that's way too complicated: it's so much more simple and hassle-free to just buy and hodl some actual coins than trade in unregulated futures on unregulated exchange, on a market that's completely unregulated and probably fraught with all sort of pump-and-dumps and insider trading schemes.
Bitcoin futures trading can be a legitimate activity if you're a professional investor and are able to follow the markets all day, and have are able to trade while leaving a significant share of your capital on the sidelines. But for individuals with a real job, this is just Russian roulette. The price of bitcoin is correlated with almost nothing else (the largest correlation, in absolute value, that I've been able to find it is 0.09 with the USDCNY), and doesn't react to macroeconomic events the way other assets do.
The terrible thing is that the price of bitcoin is bound to go up for a bunch of macroeconomic reason we all know, so there's no point in going through all these hoops to make a profit, just buy and hodl in cold storage!

Interesting, I lost 2.25BTC betting that Hillary would win. I was actually rooting for Donald Trump, but back in September/October I was extremely pessimistic about his odds. I trusted the polls (which at the time had him losing the popular vote by 5-8%) way too much, thinking there was no way that they could all be so wrong at the same time. I thought that winning some bitcoin would be a good hedge against the disappointment of seeing Hillary elected.
Eventually he won and I was happy about it, while still being upset I lost 2.25BTC! I'm perhaps even more upset of having been wrong with everyone, and of having bought in the narrative the media fed us. I'm usually so skeptical about the mainstream media, and this time I decided to trust it because Trump's campaign genuinely seemed hopeless. But that's how you learn I guess. The world is full of surprise.
I bought back the BTC I lost immediately after the election, and it's greatly appreciated since then.

Core doesn't exist. There is no Core (or core, why should it be capitalized?). There are a bunch of open source developers who work on a repo, in which whatever happens to be consensual gets merged. "core" is a process, not an organisation. If core developers don't suggest a timeframe, it's not because a HF would be "against core policy" but because none of them (at least the most active ones) think that a hard fork at this point would be a good thing.
If you want to know why, you can try talking with them (I'm assuming you haven't already but i may be wrong), on IRC or elsewhere.
In all cases, designing specs behind closed doors with a bunch of rich dudes and then throwing them at developers shouting "these specs have consensus! Implement them or else!" will not get you very far.

I think RSK (and other sidechains, whether centralized or hopefully later decentralized) are complemntary with mainchain: use the mainchain for sound money to use as store of value, and use sidechains to use this value in day to day life. RSK isn't perfect but it's a good enough scaling solution until Segwit gets activated, and the lightning network arrives in bitcoin.

I wouldn't short the various ETH/fiat rates, nor would I short any cryptocurrency vs fiat currency; but shorting ETH/BTC might definitely makes sense IMO.

The upside is so enormous that I would buy even if the price was at $1000 or $2000. Bitcoin is the first borderless, uncensorable currency, and the ultimate reserve of value (has a fixed supply, has perfect liquidity, is impossible to seize through pressuring a third party).
But most importantly: buy because you agree with the vision of the future that bitcoin enables: a future where governments won't be able to erase debt with inflation, where tax enforcement will be much harder, and where governments have to respect individual rights and provide services of real value in order to survive.

Agreed. I meant, over short/medium term, shorting alt coins vs BTC can yield you a few dozens or hundreds of percent of gains.
But any investment that is not "long crypto" today seems absurd when you think of the room for growth that cryptocurrencies have. I also have positions in a few technology stocks like Google or Amazon, which I think have a huge upside, but nowhere near what crypto could achieve.

I'm in love with both the technology and politics of bitcoin. I feel like it's the most powerful vehicle for the liberation of citizens from governments. I hope that all is going to end well, and bitcoin will be the world's reserve currency, making inflation-fueled pork barrel spending by the governments impossible.

Very people in emerging/developing countries have bank accounts or credit cards, so it's hard for them to convert their fiat money into bitcoin.
One mean to circumvent this problem is bitcoin vouchers (like that proposed by 
I'm not associated in anyway with azte.co, I just found out about it today and thought vouchers of that kind could be a great way to help bitcoin spread in developing countries.

Hi! Out of curiosity, was it hard to convince the vendors to accept BTC as a mean of paiement? Had they heard of BTC before, or were you their first customer to pay them with it? Do they keep the BTC or do they convert it to fiat?

What makes you think that?
@_date: 2016-07-01 11:06:02
The problem is that, once you start reverting/blocking certain transactions because you disagree with their purpose or effect on the network, you effectively censor certain uses of the blockchain, and thus regulate economic and social activities that are powered by the blockchain.
I think that we should all respect "blockchain neutrality", i.e. any use of the blockchain should be authorised, and whether a transaction is processed and recorded into the chain should only be a matter of whether it's technically valid (properly signed, not a double spend, etc).
If we start promoting certain uses and restricting other uses by altering blockchain history through majority (or supermajority) votes, then we become no better than the great "democracies" that have given us fiat money and surveillance agencies.
We would also expose ourselves to being pressured by external actors (for example governments, "democratic" or not) into censoring blockchain uses that they disagree with.
Black listing adresses or cancelling transactions brings us one step closer to that.

In the US that's very little money, but in many other parts of the world (including some really nice parts, like rural France for example) it's enough to enjoy a decent if subdued way of life.

The main author of the report doesn't understands that the only point of a blockchain is to enable permissionless interactions between users who are unknown to eachother. For permissioned applications between known parties, a simple MySQL database will be much more efficient than a blockchain.

I actually think they won't do anything. Look at encryption. They cannot even put a dent in the problem. The US government is leaking data from every orifice, and can barely make a functional website for the signature program of its president (the Affordable Healthcare Act).
In fact, their evil deeds result more from their ignorance and cluelessness than from them being actually evil - at least in the West. By the time a critical mass of economic activity will have shifted to Bitcoin, they will be powerless to stop it from becoming the de facto currency in their countries (because inflation in fiat and deflation in bitcoin will incentivise people to sell fiat and hoard bitcoin, thus amplifying the inflation of fiat and deflation in bitcoin, until fiat isn't worth anything and bitcoin becomes the de facto currency). Greed, fear of missing out, and loss aversion are our rocket to the moon.
Of course, external actors (ie governments) can and probably will try to impose some friction on this phenomenon: but their only defences (internet censorship, currency controls) can only work if they're willing to go Full Totalitarian on their population; the Chinese government might give a crack at it, governments that have completely deprived their citizens from access to the internet (like North Korea) will be able to survive, but other governments (including the western ones, who are corseted by their own laws and public opinions) won't do anything, and will just sink.
That's just like, my opinion man :)

But issuance at a constant rate would turn out to be deflationary after some time, I believe. At some point, the total if money in circulation will be so large that the constant increment will be a smaller fraction of it than the GDP growth rate. Then you have a money supply that increases more slowly than the GDP, which is deflationary.
