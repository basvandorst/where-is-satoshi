I sold most of it a few days ago for some profit after holding for over a year and won't buy-in again until Tether et al is out of the market. I believe in BTC itself but not this de facto QE going on with the exchanges managing 'liquidity' for us. The manipulation using this USDT 'trust' instrument (lol) circumvents the entire purpose and appeal to me of BTC being a trustless, limited (like gold) asset. I mean if I wanted more fiat I'd just stay in dollars. BTC is limited, but Tether now proves BTCs price and market cap are manipulatable between exchanges like all of the other markets. No thanks.

Testing if I can post...
Edit: 
I'm with you on 'the system has failed' concern. Only good news I can think of is that a crack down on bitfinex and tether (and their 'spoofy' accounts) would at least temporarily shut down the manipulation since they apparently rely on tether to manipulate price/market cap. The risk then though is that other tether-like entities can pop up in other exchanges not directly bank account-related in the meantime, and people will just start exchanging in those allowing new manipulation. My hope is that eventually a totally transparent stablecoin will be adopted and this one would replace these tethers and help all the markets, though it could be a while. I'm waiting for that to happen myself since the whole point of BTC for me was to get out of fiat...could care less about the price and making a profit knowing it's so easily manipulated. As long as tether's in place you're betting against some crazy, unpredictable odds and long-term is a farce. My biggest concern then for BTC and others is that they will be replaced before that happens (by the stablecoin itself maybe) and that this was maybe the plan all along.
