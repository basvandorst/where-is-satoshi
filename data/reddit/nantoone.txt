The money doesn't lead to the prospect of new tech -- the prospect of new tech leads to money.
And it's not just a few people that decide the value, it's every buyer and every seller on the market. Millions of people and billions of dollars that ultimately decide what the price of a coin is. The market's a constant argument of people that think it should be worth less and people who think the contrary. The contrarians have a reason to think that way -- whether it be a technology, or in most cases right now, the prospect of a technology.

Hot damn you do not get it, like at all.


It's not the music store, it's the bongo company in this example. The music store gives you their own coins as a reward for buying from their stores.


Yep. Except it's wildly more profitable for the company and consumer.




Not like any rewards program that's been possible before.


Yes, the company would make their token representative of something their company offers. That's what gives it value. It could also act like a stock and represent the company entirely.


We buy and sell based on what we think they're worth.


Cash is a really roundabout way of doing simple trade. It isn't necessary anymore.


It allows us to take advantage of the value we create. You're creating value every time you're using a product or service. Every piece of your data and every second of your usage is valuable. 


The internet tends to get word around nowadays. Y'know, if somethings worth your time you usually end up hearing about it. But if you want to look at ads that bad, you can always turn them on and receive rewards for looking at them. Just another way to get money.


Never said they were eliminated, just that Mcdonalds doesn't have to use them anymore.


A predetermined automated algorithm. It's in everyone's best interest for the coin to rise. If the purchasing power goes to nill, the CEO's suffer just as much as the workers.

Ok so there's this cool thing called AI, and mobile wallets. And get this, they handle all of it for you. So let's say you need some BONGO coins because you automatically get 5% BONGO coins back when you spend BONGO coins to buy a bongo. And you happen to have some McDonalds Coins from the reward you got for buying McDonalds a week ago, and the Bongo Coin to McDonalds Coin exchange rate is cheap today. Your wallet automatically figures this out and tells you it can get 1 bongo for just X amount of BONGO coins, or CAD, or YEN, or whatever the hell unit of currency you want it to show you, and it'll get X worth of rewards from X amount of companies and their affiliates. 
That all happens under the hood. All you tell your wallet is you want bongos, and it comes up with the cheapest, most profitable possible way for you to get them. Then it invests your rewards and gets you even more money.
Why would companies pay people to do something? Because paying people directly for their time and business is far more valuable than paying an ad agency, ad creator, publisher, and all the middlemen in between to advertise a product in the hopes of gaining the interest of non-interested people. And, when you create a token economy and reward people for beneficial actions correctly, and incentivize them to circulate the currency, your coin and your company value rises.

There's always a merit for the adoption of new currency. Occasionally it's a meme, but most of the time it's new tech or the prospect of new tech. 
It's the limited supply that makes them a currency, but just because there's a lot of currencies doesn't mean they all have money flowing through them. 
If money flows into one currency and the overall marketcap stays the same, then it's just flowing out of other currencies. Not because it's just a "fad", but because they have some promising aspect or technology people want to invest in. That's also why all cryptocurrencies can't be grouped together - most of them do different things.
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:41:54
Exactly! Every time I go over there it's ridiculous how many of the things they complain about can be fixed with a crypto economy. UBI, wealth distribution, government greed, etc etc... I guess they will learn in time.

How much does that unused account cost BofA though? $12 a month sounds incredibly steep.
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:02:26


Never said it was a legitimate or wise merit, just that it is one.


If fiat has no limit then lets just make as much money as we want, right? Then everyone'll be rich. It's unlimited after all.


A universal currency isn't necessary with crypto. Currency will take on a different form with the advent of this technology. Businesses and companies will mint their own currency with the technology that is most suitable for them, and they'll incentivize people to use their currency in ways that'll benefit its economy. Currency is so much more capable than the fiat accessory we know it as today.

Holding is way riskier than trading. If you know how to buy and sell correctly you come out of 95% of trades successful, as opposed to holding and hoping for the best. It's guaranteed profit vs. not guaranteed profit. The mistake everyone makes is going in inexperienced and giving their money to the experienced. Teach yourself to be the latter
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:09:20
I'd say a more apt comparison would be Bitcoin = the internet while banking = mails/letters. And then a Chrome will come along and build on the technology in a way everyone will want to use.

Bitcoin proved that the technology works. That was it's purpose it did it well.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:24:13
It's not just with Bitcoin - there's coins that are actually usable and capable of changing things and if you go to most community discussions it's all people hoping for a price spike. Even massive upgrades to the technology mostly creates discussion about what % the chart will go up or down, not the potential for the technology itself.

I don't think you should skip out on it entirely, but only put in an amount of money that you would be completely fine with losing.
Collaborate with your parents and ask for them to use their card/bank account while you give them cash. Some popular websites for buying BTC are Coinbase and Gemini.
Keep your funds in USD on your account until there is a substantial dip in the price of BTC. That's when you want to buy it. Other than that just be patient and don't be stupid with your money.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:13:56
Crypto removes the necessity of currency in the way we use it today. Currency/fiat was only created to make trade easier under government, but crypto allows for there to be free direct trade of real-world objects from person to person again using coins representative of those real-world objects. Bitcoin will still exist and you could pay for anything for it, but it nor any other currency will be a singular measure of world value.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:38:50
The purpose of Bitcoin was to introduce a technology to society and prove that it fundamentally works. It's the ARPANET of today's internet.

Make an account on an exchange like Coinbase or Gemini. Don't invest what you can't afford to lose. Wait for the price to dip before buying in.

No matter what happens to bitcoin, there will always be some crypto nerds that still believe in it... always. Therefore there will always be buyers. Maybe they'll only buy it for $1, but the market is never going away.

There's always someone willing to pay for it. You just sell it to the highest bidder. Right now the highest bidder is ~$10,800.

The US dollar doesn't have any real world assets backing it up either... gold backing the dollar ended in 1971. The governments purpose in currency now is to state the worth on a collection of hard-to-recreate objects and manipulate it in certain ways to have everybody on the same page to make trading goods and services easier from citizen to citizen and now over the internet.  
But there's flaws... the governments and banks have human workers that need to get payed, and they have (occasionally) greedy human CEO's wanting to get payed way more for (occasionally) bad incentives. There's hundreds of millions of dollars getting payed to these people daily.
Now what if we dissolved all of that, automated everything, and redistributed the "would be" wage of bankers among the citizens in meaningful incentivized ways, ways that would make them stimulate the economy in a healthy fashion?
Instead of (occasionally) greedy humans manipulating the economy and making decisions we don't really have control over, there's a truly democratic way of automating it all while rewarding citizens for stimulating it through buying and selling among other things. What if we apply a similar idea to other businesses where automation replaces a majority of it's employment?
A perfect trading system would be one with a counterfeit-proof, verifiable object that could instantly be sent to someone across the world at the witness of everyone else in the world. After 2600 years of using the old fiat system, we now have this in cryptocurrency. 
Would you rather have your money backed fairly, for free, by the rest of humanity... or (occasionally) greedy people, nations, or governing bodies?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:58:35
The total amount of gold on earth isn't completely known. There is still some yet to be found and we don't know the exact rate that will happen. Whereas with Bitcoin we know exactly how much exists, exactly how much is getting minted, and exactly how it's distributed. Much more reliable.

The point this article is making is incredibly stupid. Bitcoin is dead because it's worth so much that buying every-day items would become too complicated?
Have they forgotten that the apps we use can show the value in any currency? You can say "this will cost $3.", scan the QR code, and $3 worth of bitcoin is taken from your wallet. You don't have to look at a decimal the whole way through.
It's like they're grasping at straws to find reasons for btc to fail.

Call me stupid but if everyone sells BTC doesn't that mean an equal number of people have to buy it as well? You can't sell BTC without a buyer so how are these crashes so big and the market so volatile? This is something I've thought about and there's probably an easy answer and I'm just dumb.

Eeh, it pains me to see someone buy so much at this point. The ceiling at 5,000 is a strong one, and I don't think it's going to cross it any time soon. You could be holding a little while to see profits.
Just for future reference, the best time to buy is during a crash. Especially with that much money, you could easily make 10%-20% with patience and timing.

I'm talking very long term. It's going to be slow, but it'll happen. It's not that Bitcoin will get worse or degrade, it's just that things that are better than it will come along. Alts follow BTC's price naturally during short periods of time, but overall Bitcoin's market cap compared to other coins has been gradually getting lower.
Bitcoin is serving the most important use of all. It's introducing society to blockchain technology, and BTC will get used widely because of that for at least the next decade. But eventually, the technology it introduced will evolve and be used in our lives in ways we never thought possible. It's natural and healthy for any technology.
I'm also not saying that it's downhill from here for Bitcoin, or that your investment isn't worth it. I'm invested in it. It could hit 100k before going back down, who knows. It's going to be a long, gradual process before Bitcoin dies, but there's no doubt in my mind that it will.
