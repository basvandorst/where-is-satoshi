sorry i should of mentioned i thought it was funny that bitcoin was assembled with GitHub then after Satoshi fired up the first Blockchain Giving birth spitting out Bitcoins who passed it out to the hardworking miners who keep the Life support system going to eventllay gaining popular in the mainstream forcing traders pushing it's value to increase %1000 worthy enough to pay the same dudes who built it!  ?Unreal  cuz above all Bitcoin is totally Unbreakable and now running on the largest computer power network in the world Geez His parents must be proud!

Bitcoin hasn't been hacked! the software or your own computer system﻿ containing your online wallet was hacked - i think this is the main point people need to realise before complete acceptance
