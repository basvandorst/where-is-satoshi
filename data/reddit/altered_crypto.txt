No one knows what Bitcoin will do. If you can't HODL without it affecting your day to day finances, then you should sell immediately. The common phrase is "you should only invest what you can afford to lose." Also, If this little dip scares you, you should sell and don't look back. Crypto trading isn't for you.
Most of the people that live in r/Bitcoin believe $10K is just a mile marker on the road to $100K or higher(aka moon). HODL's the way to go until you die of starvation.

I told my good friend that I feel compelled to drag him into bitcoin with me but that i didn’t want to pressure him or constantly badger him. I told him that if he wanted in, just let me know. I haven’t tried to sway him since. 
Bitcoin is a huge risk whether you believe in it or not. I wouldn’t feel comfortable knowing I responsible for someone losing their life savings. Best to let them come to their own conclusion and if they need help, provide it.

It's amazing how fast people's minds change when something loses 94% of it's value.

i had the same dream around the same time. It was hitting $7500. I haven't had another since tho. I have a feeling we're going to have a tough time getting over the 10K barrier. But once it goes...it's gonna GO.

I got on GDAX for like a second and got a buy in at $9000. Feeling pretty good right now.

If it wasn’t on purpose this time, it will be next time.

i was playing the odds that money would flow back into alts after the fork. Now i'm wondering if money was only in alts to shield against the fork. think maybe i made the wrong move.

Does it? He just listed two companies that he had shares in? Were they the only companies? It's possible he panicked and sold Pets.com shares too. Hindsight is always so much clearer.

I don't think anyone has the answer to this. I just got done selling off about 90% of my BTC holdings for a large spread of other crypto that's been sliding down the last few weeks. I'm betting they'll return to where they were stable 2 months ago and i should make some good profit. hopefully. No one knows. I personally think BTC has a chance to get close to 8K before the 2X fork, but will correct down to the 4-5K range. Then i expect volatility for a few days and a level off around 6K. But that is nearly a complete guess.

won't it drop from all the moves back into alts? I was expecting a drop off after the fork just from that. Anybody's guess, i guess.

Eh. You’ll win some, you’ll lose some. Not a big deal.
