How is bitcoin not a centralized ledger when only 1 ledger exists and everyone has a copy of it? Bitcoin's ledger technology allows for real time updates instead of relying(trusting) on accountants.. THIS is the innovation.

US labor force is now more reliant on government and corporations then ever in history.
Bitcoin promotes a return to self reliance and self employment.

Bitcoin is a centralized ledger that is distributed amongst many people. Can you explain what "decentralized trust" even means?

We've come down 80% in a year.

The disturbing part is we are barely higher than 2 years ago. This goes to show that pumping Bitpay and Coinbase accepting merchants has been nothing but a waste of time.

This community needs to be aware not to trust anything written by crypto news sites...

Blockchain technology essentially eliminates the need to store records with a specific party. Record keeping becomes transparent and distributed. Millions of blockchains can exist with "tokens or whatever you want to call it" representing claims to various real world assets. Like any economic transaction this requires an element of trust. Blockchain technology can be used to *decentralize* credit creation(claims on future wealth) with massive transparency, this could potentially reboot local economies. Credit becomes money when human labor is applied and turns it into wealth. Unfortunately this goes against bitcoin itself. Bitcoiners oppose the use of blockchain technology for anything that does not *directly* increase bitcoins value. Bitcoiners believe value is created out of bitcoin itself. Anything that does not boost the value of a BTC, is frowned upon by this community.

The higher the price goes the more money is needed to hand to miners to sustain it.

Stability is impossible because you cannot gauge how much fiat is moving around Bitcoin. Long run means what exactly??

The blockchain said let it be confirmed and it shall be done.

It won't work because miners create $10 million worth every 10 days. You would need someone constantly buying all the new coins created. In a single year we have $300 million being created so you can see the problem here..

Little bit of truth this subreddit does not want to hear.

I can confirm I've received 1 fiat withdraw from them so far and have some pending.

Price is a reflection of mood in the space. 14 month bear market and we have business closing every week. Price always leads.

Just frustrating that this subreddit shrugs off these trust issues everytime like it's ok.

prices in bitcoin are up 200% since last year, worse then venuzuela
