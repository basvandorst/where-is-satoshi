What's your go to?  I can't use a few sites (Gemini) because my state in the U.S. isn't listed yet, and I have a Chinese phone number.  (Won't risk not having a phone attached)
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:55:09
Will make a move by day's end (China) today.

I am American but living in China teaching in Dongbei, the N.E.  cost of living is quite low so I've just began to funnel savings into BTC.  Like many I am sad I didn't do it 2 years ago when I first year.  Woulda made my plan to move south much better right at this moment.  However, the best thing to rectify that is what I'm doing now.  I travel a lot and do documentaries about the underground scenes here.  Heading to Beijing for some Maybe Mars gigs on October 1.  You can see some stuff I've done here at   Anyway, I'd say anyone who is able should jump into the TESOL world until you get comfortable where you are, especially Americans.  Not being there during the new president has been a very grand privilege. Cheers.

No idea, but I'm buying in for 1/3rd, as a little movement toward 3,000 won't hurt too bad, but an upswing would.  Already missed my shot at $2,950, so, time to act, I'd say.  Doubt it'll dip into the 2's.  Worth the shot.
@_date: 2017-09-17 14:08:05
Alright...after missing my chance at $3,000 even, and watching this dip and bounce for 24 hours, I finally pulled the trigger on my first ever 1/3 of a coin around 3,550.  Only had dipped my toes in the water with a few hundred bucks before this!  Let the games begin!  ☠️
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:27:00
Still waiting.  $3,050... keep dipping, BTC!
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:21:53
Congratulations!  That is huge.  Now you can really watch it all unfold, and have more stake!  I am really wondering if I should throw in for a half at these prices, but I think I'll wait and see how September plays out.  Might kick myself later, but....with this volatility, anything is possible.  Here's to number 2!
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:32:03
Good calls!  If things don't dip below $3,300 today, I'm throwing down for a third.
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:26:10
OW MY HEART.
@_date: 2017-09-18 02:51:32
It's September 18th in China.  Can we get a new price thread?  O_o
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:21:34
I'd say buy 2 by the end of today. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:05:19
Excellent.  Gah, part of me feels like the difference isn't too crazy to make up at a grand at these prices.  I think if things start hovering to go above 3,800, I'm going in and hoping for dips later.  
@_date: 2017-09-18 02:52:01
At this point, I'm with paddy.  We'll see on 9/30 and 10/30, but now is the time, IMO.
@_date: 2017-09-18 02:49:44
I agree on some aspects, but for me, as a brand new entry, I need to start getting some skin in the game at a decent price.  I missed my chance at $3,000 even, so $3,500 is a good entry point.  If it were to creep back to $4,500 this week, a grand would go much less.  Now, if it dips harder, I can get myself up to a full coin that much quicker, and really start seeing growth over time.  My 2 LTC.  Cheers. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:21:34
I'd say buy 2 by the end of today. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:09:42
Can we also talk about Coinbase gouging an extra $150 on top of prices right now?  Been hovering my finger over a buy button for 48 hours now.  Haha.  FML.
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:49:43
$3,500 and dropping.  I'm kind of happy I live in China ATM!  What a weekend!  Brand new to this and hoping for a Coinbase buy of my first grand ever around 3,200. HODLING on that buy button until tonight if this drop keeps up!  
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:45:24
Upswing?  $3,250 and climbing.  Coinbase is gouging like a mofo.  O_o  
@_date: 2017-09-18 09:09:28
It did though.  After cursing myself for not buying at 3,000 I got in late Sunday for 3,450.  Not a bad buy considering we're close to 4 now.
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:32:32
Oof.  I am sorry.  I myself as a total newbie to this as of this week, am still circling the "buy" button for $1,000 at $3,300.  Hope it goes lower.  Going to see how September plays out.  As always : HODL!  
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:21:40
Ha. Edited. :P 
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:09:39
Please update us that you are still alive.  O_o

Only in the crypto world is $1,500 not a dip.

@_date: 2017-09-22 23:12:53
Bought in a little more at $3,500.  Edging my way to a full coin.  Should hit it by year's end.  :)
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:46:24
A week of FUD and a major, HUGE country closing down exchanges, i'm surprised it's not lower.  Big deal.  Good opportunities amidst the panic.  Feel bad for those who bought at 4,900.  Tough years ahead for them.
@_date: 2017-09-20 00:43:03
I mean, by that logic, just keep the price thread forever so we can all laugh at everyone's predictions over the course of a year....you know?  Why wipe once per few weeks.
@_date: 2017-09-17 07:11:13
Right, but I mean, if someone bought two at $4,900 they now MUST wait until it cracks the all-time high, just to make a very very small profit, and start over.  That really sucks.  Even that may take a while.  Guess we'll see how it all shakes out.
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:25:39
Okay...goddamn.  About to break into $2,000.  I am sorry (again).

Same... $1,000 @ 3,400 or so.  Let's roll!

Waiting until tonight at this rate.  Right before China goes to bed, is my plan, unless other news brews.  
@_date: 2017-09-24 03:33:45
Holding more than one now I hope!  Will never forgive myself for not getting in around then.  This is the best redemption.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:24:54
Why on earth would you buy in so high?  Man.... I can almost guarantee low 5,000's or 4,000's in less than a week, or November.  Hit dat RemindMe! one week tag.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:51:40
I'm happy either way, but ya'll are wicked foolish to buy at $6,000.  Goodnight!
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:50:07
Will see what China does today, as I eat noodles, and pull the trigger on a bit.  Worst case I buy more on an even better dip.
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:48:05
Eh.  I just don't buy that if you look at the history.  If they were thinking that long term, they'd wait to see what happens either next week, or in November.  
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:52:46
Who gives a shit about the forked coin if you're talking a $1,000+ correction on the thing you'd buy!  Just....take a breath.  Wait.

Uh....I would wait. Don't buy the highs, people. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:00:41
Oh man, the Batman ride!  Is this the 6 Flags in Illinois?  If so, does it still have the Batman 1 Danny Elfman music with the police car while you wait in line?  I doubt it's still the same....., but if so, I cannot believe it's still there!  20+ years ago I rode this with my dad every year.  Best memories. Happy Birthday.  Cheers.

Feel free to yell at me if it doesn't go to $5,000 or below in the next month.  Don't know why anyone wouldn't wait a while with all this craziness.  Mind-boggling.
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:59:28
truth.  waited at 3,000 for my first decent entry to the market (at my poor-ass price....) 1/3 of a coin.  waited...waited..didn't pull the trigger.....and boom, 3,700 in an hour.  now sitting with my toes in the water.  bummed, but, hoping we creep back down to that level so i can redeem myself.  ha.  first lesson learned.
