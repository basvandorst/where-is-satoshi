I buy on Fridays. I gather up all my loose change and tips that I get from my jobs and spread them throughout crypto currencies.

I can't wait till I reach my moon. I just want to get lasik done. Tired of wearing eyeglasses.

Eth and Ltc only cause coinbase shows it

Nice! Do you really need a license to fly a drone?

So what does this do with the price of bitcoin? Does it raise or lower?
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:22:04
I bought whatever the $30 Eth one was. It's been two days and no sign of profit. Apparently I should make about $40 in two years. I don't see my pennies!
If I could turn back time.. I would not have paid $30 for this service.
Stay away!

I'm just glad to be  apart of it when I bought in at 7k
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:10:39
I gambled my monthly pay. I charged my credit card (oh my the fee) when bitcoin was at 7k. I put the whole thing.
Now I'll be able to pay it off at the end of the month so there's no interest. I made my money back but I'm HODLing. I also earned 2% cash back cause it's a purchase.
I don't recommend doing it but if you know you can pay your bill in full and have cash back benefits. I'd so do it.

I'm more worried of what's going to happen when banks open. Either we see a huge dip or the rocket will be ready for lift off.

Thanks for the quick run downs!
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:40:14
Can you make me one
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:23:13
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:08:59
Ahh! Thanks for the info.

You're trippin.
I can read and you're just being stupid. You're getting your money back. Your bank probably trigger fraud or some shit so coinbase is giving your money back. 
You don't own any bitcoin till it's in your wallet. You don't have this "profit". Just cause the bitcoin price raises doesn't mean your refund will be at the price. It's the price that you bought it at.

Did you forget to select debit card as payment? It usually defaults to bank account.
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:20:39
Mine shows $1250
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:35:10
Just cause you bought at a dip and maybe your bank rejected and now you're saying you got scammed cause bitcoin price raised?

I read that you should reset and test the Trezor before moving coins to it. Too lazy to search for it.
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:44:36
Trezor or the Nano S

I didn't  read the article but from what I've read on Reddit is that the insurance is only covered if it's the USD wallet and not the coins.
So if you bought BTC, LTC, ETH then you're not insured.

Is this guy off the grid or something?
