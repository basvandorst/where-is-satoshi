That does indeed say that, but that doesn't have any proof that a vaccine caused autism. There is no definition of "autism related" and losing a court case != proof.
That wiki article also says also talk about the medical and scientific community thoughts: 
"The medical and scientific communities nearly unanimously denya link between routine childhood vaccines andautism, as no evidence has been found to support this claim". Nearly unanimous is a pretty strong indicator when it comes to science.
In fact, the one "autism related case" is described: "In 2008 the federal government agreed to award damages to the family of Hannah Poling, a girl who developed autistic-like symptoms after receiving a series of vaccines in a single day. The vaccines given were DTaP, Hib, MMR, varicella, and inactivated polio. Poling was diagnosed months later withencephalopathy (brain disease) caused by a mitochondrial enzyme deficit, a mitochondrial disorder; it is not unusual for children with such deficits to develop neurologic signs between their first and second years. There is little scientific research in the area: no scientific studies show whether childhood vaccines can cause or contribute to mitochondrial disease, and there is no scientific evidence that vaccinations damage the brains of children with mitochondrial disorders. Although many parents view this ruling as confirming that vaccines cause regressive autism, most children with autism do not seem to have mitochondrial disorders, and the case was conceded without proof of causation."
Science has proof, court systems are legal only. I was actually asking for the source of the two people coming out and saying that it was rigged.
