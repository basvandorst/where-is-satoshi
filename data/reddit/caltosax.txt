I'm now more bothered, because I wasn't able to withdraw my CAD from QuadrigaCX before the CEO died.... urgh.

I love seeing Litecoin ATMs. I hope they become more popular

I REALLY hope the owner of that recovery phrase has moved all of his finds elsewhere...

I bought in mid-2017, and sold enough in January to make back my original investment. The dip doesn't bother me because even if it went to $0 (which I highly doubt), I'm not worse off than if I'd never invested in the first place. It's tempting to put more money back into it, but I enjoy the freedom of not having too much at stake. 
I'm looking forward to the next price hike. Even if it's not for a few years, I'm refusing to sell during a down time. Maybe the next bull run will pay the down payment for my first house!

Good for you, on both accounts! I hope you are able to add that new child to your family soon. What a blessing! If I drank tea and lived in the States, I would definitely support you!

As you said, less hash power needed to find the reward.  isn't that the definition of "easier"?  Isn't it "easier" to lift a 10lb kid than a 20lb kid.  The end result is the same (you're holding a kid), but there's a difference in how much energy you've expended.
