I think they are highly incentivized to avoid bankruptcy for sure. They may not have a choice if there's an involuntary proceeding though. One thing is for sure, working with and vetting a plan with all customers is critical. I haven't heard many details yet.

The question arises -- what if there is not enough to get funds back to all? In that case, insolvency rules apply. Surely you'd be at least thinking about solvency as an executive in a situation like this.

Yet they paid a CFTC fine recently.

I'm not sure I want to do that yet. If it's helpful to Bitfinex I would happily pass it on to them.

For some time their cold storage was at Xapo actually. I'm not sure if that's changed in the last few months.

When the US, US Dollar, and money transfer is involved, very often yes. For instance, all US dollars at bank accounts are ultimately held in Manhattan, so they can be transferred on FedWire. For better or worse, you deal with dollars, the US has jurisdiction.

That is not how brokerages work. They have custody and take responsibility for being funded.

I just checked my account at bitfinex, the bitgo wallet had most of the coins removed at 2:25 AM, I presume pacific time from the report. They were sent to a non-Bitgo address.

Prison becomes a worry when actions are taken around insolvency that privilege certain classes of participants. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:31:33
They absolutely don't have that choice if they want to stay out of prison. Whatever the internal mechanics of their money storage, they are holding US customer funds and will be subject to some US laws, I promise you. In the US, you don't get to say "Oh, sorry sir, the drawer with YOUR cash in it was stolen, not anyone else's". They have custody of the funds, full stop, no matter how the funds are organized.

Wait, does this mean that if one user's multi-sig account had no coins stolen in the breach, and another did, you will margin close the customer with coins stolen? 
This seems like a very, very bad idea. Under no circumstances should anyone but bitfinex be responsible for securing user balances.

It was about 50BTC. I have the 'track wallet' feature turned on in Bitgo, so I was able to see it through my bitgo login.

There should be a slack channel!

Are you referring to Charlie or Mark?
@_date: 2015-12-15 18:30:10
Just wait.

I voted for you, Olivier, and floated the idea that we should shut down and just return donations pro-rata to members some time ago; the ones left active on the board are the ones who didn't want to do that.
Thanks for trying; you are in a small group of people who understand the difficulties inherent there; if I understand the by-laws correctly, after a vote of no-confidence, they need to re-hold a general election for your member category. 
I feel like creative-om ("We don't need a foundation"), although probably for different reasons -- the dream of a mix of community members and corporations working together on Bitcoin in a formalized setting seems dead to me, but I think it was a good shot, and worth trying -- if it had worked, Bitcoin would be stronger today.

This is a possibility that the bylaws account for, by the way: both of these seats should be filled by a general election from the 'individual' members. 
Historically, the industry and individual members (ex-Gavin) have had some difficulty working out a plan that they all like. I think that, in general, all of the recent board members have represented their constituents well, which is what has made me bearish on a 'big tent' organization like the Foundation working: the differences of opinion,  goals and approaches are vastly different.
You will generally at least only see one side of the concerns and debate on reddit; industry folks won't often put their side out on the Internet, so it can feel very one-sided. In reality, I thought, and still believe, that both groups have something to offer. 
For whatever reason, the Foundation hasn't been successful at pulling everyone together.

Satoshi will be removed as a "Founding Member" when the Foundation re-homes to England; UK Law requires identification information for all founders. That designation is a technical designation of the bylaws, by the way. 
There's nothing secretive and nefarious about him being a founding member; every version of the Foundation bylaws is online and accessible for everyone at  -- feel free to read and comment on them; all pull requests are voted on by the board as a whole.
Adding Satoshi to the Founding members was a courtesy, and I think understood to be one by Bitcoiners at the time. He has so far not exercised any of his Founding member rights, at least that I'm aware of.

Damnit, man! I've been trying to keep this under wraps for years now!!

I've never spoken to Ryan, and have no idea why he thinks I'm the cause of Gox's 'downfall'. I do wish he would stop referring to his readers as 'idiots' though.
There's so very much misinformation bandied about and there have been so many different phases of the Foundation's life that I have no idea where you're coming from inre: conflict of interest. If you care and are a Foundation member, come to Bitcoin 2014 in Amsterdam next week and ask at the Member's meeting open forum, there will definitely be time to talk about stuff like that if that's how the members want to spend the time.
Personally I am most excited to hear about Bitcoin in Africa/Botswana from Alakanani Itireleng. I've just been reamed by my banks trying to remit funds to Africa, and it pisses me off.

He can be immortalized if he makes the pull request on github. Just sayin'

Fascinating! I look forward to more.

Do you need capital? What are your credentials?

I'm enjoying eligius. Nice and simple.

I personally know one Bitcoin millionaire. Not me, sadly! I could have been, though, bought my first coins at $.06 per.
