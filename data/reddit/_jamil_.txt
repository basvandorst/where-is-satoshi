How many supermarkets accept it? How many landlords will take it for rent payments? etc..
How many reasons do you really need to get change? For laundry and.... splitting up a bill at a restaurant and... ? Pretty sure laundry machines won't be taking bitcoin anytime soon and multiple people paying restaurants with bitcoin comes with it's own problems.

...but it's cheap!

Yeah, leave bitcoin to be used by Silk Road, not those shady fucks over at Zynga!

How does having to be paranoid and not trust anyone create more efficiency? I could only see how you would have to invest slower and with less money - so that you don't lose more than is necessary - not the opposite

no worries :)

My god that's complete bullshit. Yeah it signals to others about a more accurate price, after those people have already lost their money - *as is what happened here*. Was it more efficient for those who lost their money to mt gox to see that those who had inside information could cash out early? 
Little disagreement my ass. Little disagreement in the libertarian circlejerk world.

Superior for purchasing anonymously, inferior in flexibility on what could be purchased with it.

Sure it certainly would. However, if you think he is being disingenous by saying that USD is secure, wouldn't you think he would be in the middle of divesting from USD? Actions speak louder than words and Buffets' actions are in USD

My god that's a moronic statement
@_date: 2014-02-21 04:18:59
such bullshit. completed contradicted by actual events in history

That is a very shallow and terrible analysis. I hope you don't advise people financially.

Obviously is a statist

They don't ignore that at all, but they do acknowledge what you seem to be ignoring.  That people will horde the resource to the extent that they are able (bitcoins in this example) rather than spend them or use them to invest. People have done this in the past for the exact reason that brings up. He's betting that it will be worth more for him to save (horde) it.

This is exactly why economists say that deflation is bad and (very slight) inflation is good
