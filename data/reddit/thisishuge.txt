The financial times app is browser based (you have to add it to your home screen on iphone) somehow they've managed to mask all of the safari stuff such as url bar so it feels native! I'm not sure how this was done but doing that for the Bitcoin wallet would be great.

True but Netflix could easily add micro-payments as an alternative to their subscription model. Besides, in the UK Netflix is nowhere near as rich in content as the US so I often just cancel my subscription and re-enable when there's enough stuff for me to watch. This is the case for most people I know.
@_date: 2014-02-22 10:30:20
This. The point is - why would they need to? Services will be built off of ethereum that are user friendly.

Transaction fees are optional/custom - price goes up, transaction fee goes down. Fees depend on speed of propagation through network dependent on miners including transactions in a block.

Was able to login through direct login link but withdrawals are not being processed. They are always pretty quick (less than 5 minutes) but has been stuck on "Waiting to be processed" for more than 30minutes now. I'm sure it's fine but this is making me uneasy.
EDIT: Update - I have now received the BTC - Don't panic everyone it's all up and running like normal.
@_date: 2014-07-01 09:39:59
They probably haven't automated deposits yet as I am still waiting for mine to be credited. I imagine when they do, smaller deposits will be accepted.

Time will tell but personally from reading through the prospectus they are pretty set to make a splash. Setting up in Cyprus really is the perfect scenario with the vast majority of the population despising conventional banks and storing cash under mattresses. 
The real "fair" price will materialize when dividends begin appearing. Take a look at the [prospectus]( price projections based on certain scenarios. 
The conservative projection sees the company making profits by July 2014 and the optimistic projection sees profits this month. These are dependent on Bitcoin price increases however time will show the success of the other exciting business areas that Neo &amp; Bee are entering!
@_date: 2014-01-07 13:23:55

You are right and there is definitely that risk. Bitcoin ATM's require fingerprints so it's more likely that if bad press came about that a form of id would be required in order to convert.
I know that in currency exchanges they often take a scanned copy of passport/driving license while you make the transaction for the same reason.
@_date: 2014-10-15 21:52:50

Why not make a pull request instead? Sounds like you've added some great features however it seems a bit unfair on the original developer if your fork takes off and gets all the credit.
@_date: 2014-01-06 00:52:12
If an exchange has zero fees it means that traders can do a market manipulation technique which involves placing the same bid and ask price (filling their own orders). This creates artificial volume and bullish tendencies. I wouldn't be surprised if a nasty drop follows in the near term before a "real" growth rally later this year. But hell who am I to make these predictions? I'll see myself out to :)

The easiest by far in the UK at the moment is Bitbargain. As long as you choose a seller with a good history the risk is very slim. But yes, cash for Bitcoin services are a must for Bitcoin adoption. It's only a matter of time before the banks clamp down.

Can we not pool together a fund to work on this?
If found we could give a percentage back to the original owner and the remaining percentage would be evenly proportioned out dependent on donation size?
e.g. 50% back to owner, 10 people donate 1 BTC and get 5% each if found?
Seeing as I'm in the UK, if the guy can prove existing ownership of the bitcoins (e.g. public key and historical transaction) it could be very worth it. I mean say it costs £100k to fund a couple of weeks of hunting - that's a risk with a very high reward potential!

When I'm buying larger quantities (£3000+) I will do international wire transfers to bitstamp and buy from there. Otherwise I make use of Bitbargain. The prices are higher but in slower times people will sell for just about 5% premium. You have to take into account the cost of getting money to exchanges (wire fees, selling fees etc) I lose about 2-3% to those fees easily.

I did not and am aware of that risk so have copies on pigment based black and white and also usb backups. Nevertheless, I intend to check on the stash at least once a year to make sure the paper is still readable and not fading. Even without archive paper it should still survive a pretty long time as it'll be in complete darkness.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:31:50
I've got copies of the wallets in pdf format on several usbs - that should suffice? Just in case the paper fades.

Encrypting is ok but what happens if you die or forget the password? Your Bitcoins go with you..
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:43:25
Actually found a couple of concerns with the code... I've posted on the forums but maybe you'll be able to verify?
"I've noticed that on the paper wallet page you have the option to choose how many wallets you wish to create. The problem is that the "random" secureRandom object is used for ALL of the wallets which you create on that page. Why is the object not refreshed on each wallet creation?
Let me show this with screenshot.
So this random object value is used for ALL of the wallets when creating them in bulk. Surely the secureRandom should be recreated for each wallet?
Also please could somebody explain this bit of logic for randomising the 256 digits in this bit of code:
      while (sr.pptr &lt; sr.poolSize) {  // extract some randomness from Math.random()
         t = Math.floor(65536 * Math.random());
         sr.pool[sr.pptr++] = t &gt;&gt;&gt; 8;
         sr.pool[sr.pptr++] = t &amp; 255;
      }
What is the reasoning of the bitand and the &gt;&gt;&gt; 8? Couldn't this be a bit shift to a different integer? Why 8? Please explain to me."

great thanks a lot! I think I will be using bip then :) (But not with hunter2)
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:41:57
I've dug into that bit a little...
The getBigRandom function essentially calls a big integer which does something like this:
return new BigInteger(256, rng)
				.mod(limit.subtract(1))
				.add(1);
Any idea what the reasoning for the mod and add is? Presumably BigInteger will be returning a random number regardless? I guess to be safe we could add some math here to do something else to the BigInteger (the this.priv value)

I agree with you. I have been hooked on bitcoin since 2011 and my friends have never taken me seriously. I'm 22 years old and in the past couple of weeks have bad 3 friends take positions in bitcoin. Looks like people are finally starting to take it seriously.
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:42:15
Agreed - I think we will float around $400-500 until the next rally now.
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:54:56
Your understanding is correct but large corporations have now got cold feet following the announcement. Take a look at this thread:   
I quote directly: 
"A very big store in China -Suning.inc (you can imagine bestbuy in USA)- had ever contended a plan to accept BItcoin via 'exchange conversion' yesterday, however, they stopped the plan after the news."
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:22:17
I really like this suggestion - I'm taking a look at the code now!
EDIT: If anybody knows where to look that'd be great ;)
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:53:38
What exchange do you use? Bitstamp offer pretty good rates for converting the USD into GBP (these are their rates from the unicredit website: 
I guess it depends how many Bitcoins you are planning on selling.
If it's small amounts you could set yourself up as a seller on localbitcoins or bitbargain but for larger amounts I'd advise using an exchange.
EDIT: Also if it's large amounts I'd be careful of your bank freezing the funds as they come in and being suspicious.
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:32:34
This is awesome I am ordering from there tomorrow!

Everybody has a price - every time we see a bubble and crash the wealth is getting distributed more evenly as people cash out. In the future - the continuous distribution will come from mining and transaction fees. Mining companies will make their money through selling the bitcoins they obtain - further distributing the supply. 
I think that you are underestimating the current uneven distribution of wealth across the globe with 90% of the wealth held with the top 1%!
@_date: 2013-11-09 13:39:21
I am in the process of creating super secure paper wallets. I am planning to use a unix live cd on a freshly formatted/never connected to internet laptop.
I have downloaded the bitaddress source code from github and verified its integrity using shasum.
To be absolutely paranoid I have next modified the source code and added an extra layer to the random generator just to be on the safe side.
I next plan to generate the paper wallets and evenly distribute my Bitcoins over around 20 wallets and store them in a safe deposit box in a bank.
Finally, I will flash the memory on the printer I used and done.
Depending on how much you are planning to store and weighing it with convenience should give you a good idea of how paranoid you want to be and what steps you should take. 
Personally I will not be encrypting my paper wallets as the whole reason I am creating them is incase something happens to me, my family will still be able to access my Bitcoins.
EDIT: The simplest/safest way to create them would probably be to just trust bitaddress.org and use it in an offline environment on a linux live cd. Personally, I am extra paranoid which is why I'm going to the lengths of modifying the code just in case (although highly unlikely).
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:28:36
Hey I used bitaddress.org (BIP38 encrypted). I downloaded a copy of the source from github, checked the checksum and then created the wallets on a unix bootable disconnected from the world.
I also modified the source code entropy to add some of my own because I very paranoid!
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:37:29
Can't see the option available under my "send via". Has this only been released to USA or something?
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:21:05
You raise some good points and yes everybody should be aware of this. The same goes for Casascius physical coins. Although at least he has built up a good reputable reputation (at least so far).
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:02:42
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:32:50
This is true - even with bitaddress.org being open source, there could still be something malicious hidden in there OR somebody could find a flaw with the way entropy is collected.
To mitigate this risk I modified the source code before using it offline to add my own manually inserted entropy.
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:40:04
Absolutely but if somebody can guess private keys then Bitcoin is broken or somebody got *^^extremely* lucky
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:00:20
Source? Can't find any valid source to back this up. Do you have any screenshot or anything at all showing this?
@_date: 2013-10-29 11:56:39
I think paper wallets with links to resources (perhaps a login portal?) would be more effective
@_date: 2013-11-09 13:48:10
People selling during bubbles is what helps with a more even global distribution of the coins
@_date: 2013-11-08 16:38:39
Ok so I have came up with a solution now - it probably over complicates things...
What I did was modify the fn that takes in the byte array.
In this fn: 
BigInteger.prototype.toByteArrayUnsigned = function () 
I added a loop to randomly change the bytes which will be used to make up the private key, thus creating a completely different key. At least that's how I understand it...
What was your solution?
@_date: 2013-11-15 10:28:30
Yes and make sure you tell bitstamp the order size you are planning to make before sending the funds
@_date: 2013-12-16 01:24:22
That's a lot more reassuring 
@_date: 2013-11-15 15:18:27

This is huge. 
The article suggests that the exchange has had ~£200million investment which is 10% of the entire Bitcoin market cap! 
I am switching over to this exchange immediately. Their rates are very appealing and their security policy is very reassuring (100% cold storage),

At the moment the network tries to mine 25 Bitcoins about every 10 minutes. So until the next block halving that's 150 Bitcoins an hour, 3600 a day, 111,600 a month.
Difficulty affects this through trying to match computational power to the number of blocks found. The algorithm adjusts the difficulty to aim for the approx one block every 10 minutes.
At the moment we are mining slightly more than this due the difficulty not being able to keep up with the increasing hash rate. When hash rate stabilizes then this should balance out.

To be honest this is anyone's guess. We are clearly witnessing the start of much larger adoption with continuous great news spurring price increases. This is turn is making people scared to sell for the risk of the price doubling over the next week! I imagine we will witness a correction soon providing a big player decides to jump ship. But how large this correction is depends on how strong the buyer pool is.

This is true and it is very difficult to know how many are truly lost and how many are just inactive.
In saying that, as Bitcoin becomes more valuable, people will look after them better or reputable companies will look after them for people. This means that future mined Bitcoins are less likely to get lost.
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:55:38
Not really crashing yet. It's currently more of a correction to make up for the huge rally yesterday and the day before. People are cashing out.

I agree with you but might add that when I first heard about bitcoin in 2011 my sole interest was to make a quick buck. Over time I have learnt to believe in the technology and not see tk as a get rich quick scheme!
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:01:53
Wouldn't withdrawal problems result in a panic buy on BTCChina with Bitcoins rushing off to other exchanges for conversion? Just like what happened with MTGox?
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:24:11
Pretty safe but I have backup plans as well. I have also stored copies on usbs within the safe and on usbs outside of the safe (within encrypted containers). The password for the encrypted container is held securely on the other side of the country with the usb with me. I have done this the other way around as well with one usb on the other side of the country with the password for that one held with me. If I die then my family should be able to figure out the bip38 password.

See my post about this yesterday: 
I think it's safe to not trust anybody when it comes to Bitcoin and assume there's a chance that there's a hidden seed in the code that can make the addresses pre-determined.
I have taken the liberty to modify the source code before using it to add an extra layer of random to the address generation **just in case**.
