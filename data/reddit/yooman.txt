Why is that?  both can just as easily kill a man.
@_date: 2015-04-26 02:29:45
I mean, I assume he wants to do it all legit and pay the taxes.  He's just a nerdy bitcoin evangelist who wants to popularize the currency.
@_date: 2015-04-26 02:56:02
What's the advantage of Bitwage?
@_date: 2015-04-26 12:33:09
Well, the 20% discount is only for the first 3 months, it's a 10% discount after that.  However that's still pretty damn awesome.
@_date: 2015-04-26 12:35:02
He was very much not joking, there was a thing at the bottom of his craigslist ad for the apartment, "20% discount if you pay in Bitcoin", and he has this agreement with several other tenants too apparently.
@_date: 2015-04-26 12:37:32
I'll ask him for a receipt.  But he even gave me a receipt for the security deposit, I'm sure he's already planning to give me a receipt for the payment.  He seems quite legit about all of it.
@_date: 2015-04-26 17:38:48
Well, yeah, but I'm trying to say he seems legit and I don't see any lack of paperwork.
@_date: 2015-04-26 07:31:46
I see that :( it looks like I still have most of the value... hope it holds up until 4pm today..
@_date: 2015-04-26 04:27:24
@_date: 2015-04-26 22:07:18
Yeah... but it's getting better!  At least bitcoin is even an option for my rent payments, and with a nice discount too.
@_date: 2015-04-26 17:40:24
This is a lease for 1 year, and he's giving the 20% discount on rent for the first 3 months if I pay with bitcoin, and 10% discount for the rest of the year.  I wouldn't save 20% by paying cash, since it's first-and-last and the amount is high enough, the 20% discount is worth the pain of getting the bitcoin (which I ended up doing, via coinbase instant and localbitcoin.com).
@_date: 2015-04-26 12:43:03
That is basically what happened, except through an escrow system at localbitcoins.com.  I met a dude at a Starbucks and gave him $500 in cash, and watched his bitcoins arrive in my wallet before I even shook his hand.  It was cool.
@_date: 2015-04-26 01:30:27
Looks like in the US they only support credit union deposits, bank of america, and wells fargo.  all of which are closed on sundays :(
@_date: 2015-04-26 17:51:31
I see.  Well maybe that's something I'll have to consider when I'm making a little more money :)
@_date: 2015-04-26 17:41:46
I'm not committed enough to growing a bitcoin balance (especially with the exchange rate as volatile as it still is) to have a percentage converted to BTC every paycheck.  No thanks, I got USD expenses to cover.
@_date: 2015-04-26 01:35:14
thanks but... no thanks
@_date: 2015-04-26 12:40:50
It ended up being doable.  I got ~$1000 worth from coinbase instant, then found a guy on localbitcoins.com and met him in a Starbucks to trade the other $500 in cash.  Worked out great.
@_date: 2015-04-26 12:41:22
Good idea.
@_date: 2015-04-26 04:56:45
I'll try :)
@_date: 2015-04-26 12:38:57
The public ledger would hold up in court if it was a scam, right?  If I can show proof that I own the wallet with that address?
@_date: 2015-04-26 12:44:01
Went with an in-person cash trade through localbitcoins.  :)
@_date: 2015-04-26 04:13:26
I see.  So to buy another $500 worth I need to wait half a week.
@_date: 2015-04-26 04:13:10
Hmm.  Strange.  Well, i'll see if I can figure out whether that's going on.
@_date: 2015-04-26 17:46:11
I'm all set now, thanks.  But for future reference I'm in western Massachusetts.
@_date: 2015-04-26 11:54:11
Thanks for the offer, I actually found someone else on localbitcoins and got what I needed :)
@_date: 2011-06-13 18:04:35
Seems like overkill, but I commend your dedication to data integrity.
@_date: 2011-08-27 18:30:43
WHOA, now that is an explanation.  Thanks!
Edit: however what I still don't understand is: what incentive does a seller have to offer options at all?  Why would anyone take such a potentially unlimited risk?  Just to attract more buyers?
@_date: 2015-04-26 11:56:07
I'm all set with my bitcoin now, so I'll be paying him in Bitcoin today :) if I hadn't gotten the coin in time though, I'd just have paid with a money order or cash, but he's offering me a sweet 20% discount for using bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-06-13 20:38:56
Good point, sir.  Once I get my mining rig built and I have more than a few bucks worth of BTC to my name, I'll set up something like this. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 11:53:17
He's giving me a 20% discount for paying in Bitcoin.  Cash is an option but I want to save 20% :)
@_date: 2015-04-26 12:35:45
Yeah, I found nothing open on Sunday.  Nowhere.
@_date: 2011-06-18 01:10:16
I've never played the stock market before.  Do you recommend any particular trading software / service?
@_date: 2011-07-26 08:22:16
A pair of ~$70,000 pizzas?  I MUST TASTE THEM
Edit: I'm totally awesome at math
@_date: 2015-04-26 02:09:26
Oh shit it is not a daily limit, it's a weekly limit :(  Wonder if it resets sunday nights... haha
@_date: 2015-04-26 02:55:13
He is offering me a 20% rent discount for using bitcoin, for some reason.
@_date: 2011-06-18 18:13:58
Ah, that's right.  As long as the drive has the same path every time you mount it (not always the case!) the link should work ok.
@_date: 2011-07-26 16:13:59
Durr, of course.  I accidentally the decimal place
@_date: 2011-06-18 17:53:40
I'm not sure about the context, but "symlink it back" generally means, after moving a file away from its original location, you create something called a symbolic link that fools the operating system (and bitcoin software) into thinking the file is back in its original location.  If you're not comfortable with the Terminal, you may want to avoid symbolic links, but they're pretty useful.
Here's how you do it.  I apologize in advance if I over-explain, I'm writing this assuming no prior knowledge of the Terminal.  For simplicity, I'll use file.txt as the file being symlinked.
* Move the file from its original location to its new location.
* Fire up a Terminal (on a mac I believe it is in /Applications/Utilities)
* Create a symbolic link with the "ln -s" command (see [this UNIX manual page](  The ln syntax is:
        ln -s link_target link_name
Your link's target is the full path of the file in its new location, and your link's name is the full path to where the file used to be.  Also, you'll probably have to prepend "sudo" to give the command Administrator rights.  Here's the command you'll want to use (you'll be asked for your password):
        sudo ln -s /new/file/directory/file.txt /old/file/directory/file.txt
A note on the full paths: In Mac OS, the path to a certain hard drive begins with /Volumes/DRIVE_LABEL/.  (in linux, it's generally /media/DRIVE_LABEL or /mnt/DRIVE_LABEL)  When you're typing out the path, you can press Tab to auto-complete the folder you're typing.  Use this to make sure you've got the right path.  Typing /-V-o-l-[tab]-D-R-[tab] will autocomplete to /Volumes/DRIVE_LABEL/.
* That's it!  Close your Terminal.  Your filesystem now thinks file.txt resides in both locations, and any changes to one will automagically be made to the other.  That's how symbolic links work.
If you ever change your mind and want to remove the link, you can just delete the link file.  Make sure you're deleting the one you created with ln, not the actual file (they will look identical in Finder!).  Deleting a link will not delete the original file.
Also, moving the original file will not update the link, and the link will then point to a non-existent file.  This can cause problems, so you'll need to remember to delete and recreate the link.
You can also create symlinks to entire directories by adding a -d flag to the command (ln -sd).  This is very useful for shortening long directory paths-- I use it to access my Dropbox from /dropbox/ instead of /home/yooman/Documents/My Dropbox/.
Edit:  I just realized, symlinks generally don't work between two seperate drives.  Give it a try, but I'm betting when you unmount and remount your removable drive, the link will break (I may be wrong).  Be careful, and keep offsite backups of everything.

Well, he's offering me a 20% discount for the first 3 months if I use bitcoin.  Even with some fees, if I pay less than $1700 i'm saving money.
@_date: 2011-08-26 22:21:15
I'm sorry, but this explanation does not clear anything up for me.  I remain completely confused and skeptical.
@_date: 2011-06-13 17:58:52
I dual-boot linux (ubuntu natty) and osx (hackintoshed snow leopard, for iphone dev), but primarily I use the linux partition.  Sounds interesting, but how is EncFS any better than just using dropbox?
@_date: 2015-04-26 17:42:37
They all take various amounts of time to confirm identity and such, and they all have low limits for quick-turnaround purchases (which can only be done at a handful of exchanges).  I was looking for help finding out which ones I needed to go to.
@_date: 2011-06-17 20:26:15
Well, with the mining difficulty skyrocketing, I'm not too sure many people will be buying more mining gear.  In fact, all the people who are giving up on mining will sell their AMD cards, and fewer people will buy them used.  [food for thought](
@_date: 2011-06-18 18:20:21
Nope.  The network recognizes your transaction whether your client is running or not, and the next time you start up your client it'll poll the network for transactions it missed.
@_date: 2011-06-13 20:38:41
Good point, sir.  Once I get my mining rig built and I have more than a few bucks worth of BTC to my name, I'll set up something like this. 
@_date: 2011-06-19 23:23:11
No problem!
@_date: 2015-04-26 02:31:07
Well, I just bought $1000 worth with Coinbase instant, i still do need $500 of bitcoin.  If you send me that amount and I see it arrive in my wallet i'd send you $500 any way you please, PayPal, BofA checking transfer, whatever.
@_date: 2011-06-13 20:39:11

@_date: 2011-06-17 20:17:30
Man, ain't that the truth.  I hadn't thought of that... I wish I'd bought AMD stock before all this.

Do what I did to make all my family's computers silently mine for me :P
Download [GUIMiner]( and configure it for MtRed (you'll need to switch the pool to Custom, and enter the mtred configurations; host=mtred.com, port=8337).
In GUIMiner, go to View-&gt;Summary, where you'll see an Autostart checkbox on the right next to your configured miner.  Check that box to make it start mining as soon as GUIMiner is launched.
Turn on GUIMiner's Start Minimized option in the Options menu.  This will make it run in the tray without actually showing anything on-screen when it's launched.
Using Windows' Task Scheduler, make a new task triggered on startup that runs guiminer.exe.  In Windows 7, this works great, but I've had trouble with it in Windows XP unless you give the task scheduler an admin password.
Open the Properties window of the new task, and look through all the options to make sure nothing will automatically stop your mining task.  I believe by default, there's an option somewhere to "Stop this task if it runs longer than X hours".  Make sure you disable that.
Exit GUIMiner and try to restart it by right-clicking your new scheduled task and running it.  Make sure it works-- you should see the bitcoin icon appear in the system tray.  You can mouse-over that icon to check on your mining status.
Use the Taskbar options to hide the GUIMiner icon from appearing on the taskbar, so that you have to click the little arrow to see your hidden icons.  Just an extra little discreet touch.
Reboot and you should start mining discreetly!

Wow, now that is safe.  I think a safety deposit box might be a little overkill, as I doubt I'll be moving around sums equivalent to more than a few hundred dollars.  But thanks for the insight, now I know what to do if bitcoin is ever outlawed.
@_date: 2011-06-18 18:16:30
I believe a nice looking "Bitcoin Accepted Here" sticker already exists.
Edit: [yep, I was right]( although I'm not sure where to get it.

**Those of you who were registered to MtGox with a Gmail account**: Enable google's 2-step verification.  [You can learn about it here](  I've been using it since I got hacked last year, so I'm not worried at all about my Gmail security (although I'm a bit pissed that this will probably open me up to more spam).
Basically, after you enter your password google will ask you for a 6-digit number which will be different each time, to verify your login.  You can get these verification codes via an android app tied to your account, text message, phone call, or just by printing out a sheet of them and reprinting it when you run out of codes.

I noticed the same thing, and I decided to buy while the price was down earlier today.  I made my purchase at a rate of about $13.90/BTC.  Luckily for me, the price seems to have gone back up since then and I think I managed to buy as low as I could have.  Hopefully it'll keep going up..
Also, I'm late on the mining scene, I just ordered the parts for my rig a few days ago.  I see a lot of people quitting mining, but I'm trying not to let that dampen my spirits.  I figure, if they're wrong I'll be taking their place and making a profit-- if they're right, my mining rig makes a sweet gaming rig anyway.
@_date: 2011-06-18 03:54:01
Ha, actually I have USAA car insurance because my dad used to be in the Air Force.  I had no idea they offered investment services.
