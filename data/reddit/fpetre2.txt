In reality you should have some form of diversification to reduce risk. Bitcoin could be worth 100k in a few years or it could be worth 0. But having Bitcoin, Index Funds, Metals, maybe some real estate means you are guaranteed to have some value no matter what happens in the future.

You dont have to eat the Chicken, but you can sell some of the gold eggs and buy other things with it that also have value.

There is also a third alternative where you can partially cash out to a nice profit so you get something no matter what, and hang on to the rest for the "life-changing" profits. This becomes no risk high reward, but it seems that greed holds a lot of people from doing this.

Not Real Estate. It will always have value, and can provide passive income.

There is an abundance of research that shows that the best long term investment is index funds. Picking stocks, even by professionals, usually does not outperform the index fund, and you will lose a lot of money in fees.

Huh? You can buy bitcoin if you want. I have both bitcoins (and other crypto's), index funds, metals, and real estate. The key to stable financial growth is diversity. But trying to pick and chose stocks statistically is worse than throwing your money in an index fund and not looking at it. This is supported by research the world over. There was a study where monkeys randomly picking stocks outperformed portfolios chosen by professional financial advisors, and the data suggested that it was statistically a wash over the long term.
