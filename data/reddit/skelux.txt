It might, but it also might not, rendering the whole analogy pointless. We're mixing apples with oranges here.

Or it could be that he is helping convince people to miss a huge investment opportunity, it could go either way. Bitcoin might shoot up and never come back down again, or it might crash and burn and remain worthless for the rest of your life. But considering past crashes and the current mainstream adoption of Bitcoin, it's a pretty reasonable decision to take another leap of faith.

All these thousands of dollars in profits I have made because of panic sellers, so fake. I am literally drowning in the fakeness of it all.

Absolutely nothing, because citing Little Red Riding hood isn't evidence Bitcoin will/will not behave in a metaphorically similar way.

The unique combinations of bits that make up our bitcoins are very real, and the whole reason the system works is because they can't simply be forged, replicated or stolen with any ease. How is it any different to physical money? I think little slips of paper with numbers on them are pretty inherently worthless too, but it is the fact many businesses and individuals accept them in exchange for goods and services that gives it value - same for bitcoin.
