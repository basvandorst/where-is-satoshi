Darwin originally wouldn't even bring up the fact that his theory implied humans evolved because of the religious pushback it'd receive. Nearly all naturalists of the time were parson-naturalists, literally church figures, who refused to look into a mechanistic view of nature for fear of being too heretical. [Charles Hodge]( announced that Darwin's theory was essentially atheism.
I'm not saying this has anything to do with the appropriateness of Bitcoin but you got enough upvotes that you should be at least partially checked on your assertions.

I'm not pissed because her explanation was one of the more complete ones I've heard on the topic of bitcoin - in the form of video/presenters. She doesn't mention how security of online storage is far weaker than the storage of it on a hard drive. She merely mentions it as an afterthought without emphasizing the huge security difference - which I don't understand because if she learned that lesson she'd still have all her bitcoins. She doesn't talk about the security a peer-to-peer open source currency gives that private currencies don't have. There should be a streamlining process that someone should be working on to make storing bitcoins on a hard drive easier yet still just as secure. There should be some more diversity in exchange markets that will be stable. She does seem skeptical about its future, but I also bet she doesn't consider the principles on which sound money is founded on. As I always say, Bitcoin may not be the answer, but it's the best answer we got so far.

Does anyone know approximately the date in November the fork will occur? I know it won't be exact but I'm not finding a range of days despite it being October

Am I going to have issues backing up the wallet now that I already ran into the problem?

Hard hitting investigative journalism right there.

Listen, I truly appreciate your response as I wasn't getting anything that easily explained with this issue anywhere else. I haven't had time to follow your directions yet, but when I do I'll send you a little something for your kindness! Let me know your bitcoin address through a PM or here!

Does this "money laundering rule" really affect anybody using the currency legitimately?
