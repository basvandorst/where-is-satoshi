There's a difference between Bitcoins that are "in use" and Bitcoins that are "in storage ". Understand the difference, understand the risk, and implement appropriate procedures.  Playing Bitcoin is a bit like playing Eve Online in nulsec. If something bad happens to you it's your own fault.  If you are not willing to accept that principle, then this is probably not your game, and you might be better off in the World of Warcraft.

Not at all. Know the risks, act accordingly. Every person will have to decide for themselves.  Bitcoin trading/gambling is for informed, disciplined, calculating actors.  It's not for amateurs.  The former will accept the inevitable loss, the latter will cry on the internet when it happens.

People can do things for free if they want to and many people do so.  Payment is an issue for the free market to settle.  When someone says Bitcoin developers "should" be payed, there is the implication that if you don't pay them and you benefit from their labor you have stolen something.  I reject the premise of the question.

I don't expect anything to be done for free, but I wouldn't expect to pay for everything either. Just out of curiosity, have you paid the developers?
@_date: 2016-04-22 18:03:03
The answer is NO. A third party accepts bitcoin: "At no time does Valve receive or hold bitcoin."  Probably means you'll have to sign up for yet another service and hand over more personal info.  Very little if any benefit to most people.
@_date: 2016-04-02 06:24:42
Should Bitcoin developers be paid?  Payment is the execution of a contract between a buyer and a seller for some good or service.  Are the developers selling something?

I think you are confused.  If I were a communist I'd say something more like this: "As an essential service to the common good, the state will pay for Bitcoin and extract that value from the population via increased income tax."
Obviously there are issues with this though because the state would also need full control of Bitcoin.

3.  If they do figure out how to collectively use Bitcoin, where are they going to get these billions of dollars worth? From US citizens? LOL enjoy prison. LocalBitcoins? Have fun buying bitcoins from FBI agents.
4.  Build a big beautiful wall, and let people come in legally. Kick out the illegals.

Yes a seed phrase is just as value and irreplaceable as a single private key. Any solution is going to become a compromise of convenience and security. A hardware wallet is such a compromise. It allows the security of a cold storage offline wallet (almost), coupled with the convenience of an online software wallet that allows you to actually use your cryptocurrency. If you don't need to use your cryptocurrency then you don't need a hardware wallet you just need a cold storage paper wallet type solution.
There's no way to get away from the fact that you're going to need to keep either individual private keys or a seed phrase safe somewhere somehow.

If you don't need convenient access to the funds then you don't need a hardware wallet. You can create an HD cold storage wallet with Electrum, and load a watching only version onto your PC so you have access to all the generated public addresses. All you need to keep safe is the seed. This is probably the best solution, but requires an offline machine.
If you don't have an offline machine that you can use to generate the wallet, then I guess the next best solution is a single address "paper" wallet (really it shouldn't be actually paper) that you can safely store. But for security, this wallet still needs to be generated offline. Don't ever trust a website to generate this for you.

If you are dealing with a potentially significant amount of money, my best advice is find someone you know and trust that can help you, and don't try to do it yourself especially while you are so in the situation. Your husband must have had friends or family that he discussed crypto with. Don't rely on the internet to help you. Mistakes here can result in total loss, and if your lack of knowledge is total in this area you don't even know what mistakes will occur.  You are walking through a minefield here. Be paranoid, don't trust anyone you don't know personally, and don't answer any questions. Good Luck.

Lol the statement is incredibly naive in that it implies or assumes, incorrectly, that monetary policy and central banks exist for the public good. They exist to transfer over time all wealth to the .001% and keep the population enslaved and in poverty, and ultimately eliminated.
All the money that has bailed out the big banks over the last 10 years could have easily paid off a home for every family in the US and more. Did the people get that money of course not.
We don't need to be given money. We need a financial and economic system that ensures our security and control over our own wealth, without interference or manipulation by the technostate. Enter cryptocurrency which will inevitably lead to empowerment of the individual.

This is something I would consider. Call your local University and talk to the Chair of the Software Engineering dept.

What you are saying is valid, but it doesn't apply to digital copies of works, only original productions, such as paintings, live musical performances, theatre etc.  It takes almost zero effort to make an almost infinite amount of digital copies of something.  Its bitcoin vs. fiat.  Its the copies that are counterfeit, its like gaining interest on currency created ex nihilo.  Copyright won't be reduced.  Under TPP it will be extended and more restrictive.  The free market can determine what the best use of ones labor is.  I'm pretty sure there was art before we could easily make copies of it.

Sorry for your loss, there's probably malware of some kind on your computer. Unfortunately the Ledger Nano does not protect against this kind of attack. All the Ledger does is sign transactions, and doesn't care if it signs a scammy transaction.
I recommend using Electrum with you Ledger Nano, because you can preview all the details of the transaction, sign the transaction, and then broadcast the transaction all in separate steps, verifying as you go for confidence. This may have saved you in this case because even if you accidentally signed the transaction, you have the option to not broadcast. This is the final fail safe, once you broadcast there's nothing you can do.

Few are going to validate your hypocrisy here.  If you do something you believe is wrong with a clear conscience because excuses, you are an immoral person.  
Now if you said "Free flow and sharing of ideas, culture and information is the only paradigm that respects fundamental human rights, therefore I reject copyright as immoral and wrong, because it opposes freedom of belief, thought and expression as well as deprives humanity of knowledge." then you would be able to download to your hearts content without compromising your morality and becoming a hypocrite.  Certainly others will disagree with this philosophical position and try to oppose it with force, but that's to be expected.
Paying people fair market value for their work sets an excellent example, so I encourage you to find some self promoting, self publishing artists that you enjoy and send them your bitcoins :-)

You havn't been "stolen" from in this hypothetical situation, and such prejorative terms as they relate to copyright have already been banned in court.  Copying for non-commercial private use is protected in many countries, including mine, as fair use.  It isn't theft, piracy, stealing or any other such nonsense.  You don't have moral high ground and things aren't wrong because you and your copyright troll friends at the RIAA or other lobby say so, and they are slowly learning that fact as they lose millions on frivolous lawsuits.

It has been proven in studies that those who copy and share spend more on average than the high horse morality copyright shills.  Artists do not have a "right" to make a profit on digital copies.  I know that is hard to accept because the industry has grown accustomed to an outdated, failed, monopoly capitalist, interventionist copyright construct.

Yes you have to trust the person/company that creates the physical to not store the private key.  Regarding the intermediaries, the physical is usually created in a way that it must be destroyed or at least seriously damaged to get to the private key.  You'd always be able to check the balance with the public key using blockchain.info or another method.  There is definitely risk involved.  I suggest creating a physical yourself as a novelty/keepsake.  Get 2 flat pieces of stainless steel.  On one piece acid etch the private key into one side and the public on the other. weld the second piece over the private key.  Use a grinder and polish to make it nice and shiny.  Profit?

With bitcoin trading below $7,000 on Monday, 64% below its all time high, many investors have been left wondering whether this is true cryptocurrency carnage, or if bitcoin has the ability to bounce back. 
Some have taken to Twitter and Reddit to exchange stories of lost potential, and what it means to see thousands of dollars in investments evaporate in a matter of days. 
But bitcoin, which increased 1,800% in value over the course of 2017, is known for its volatility. 
Despite consumer fears, professionals in the cryptocurrency market have much more long-term views when it comes to bitcoin's ability to rebound. Holding, or "HODLING" as its known by aficionados, requires patience and resolve. And despite bitcoin's relatively short history, many of these believers are taking comfort in the fact that bitcoin has never failed to bounce back from a hard dip, so far.
A $50,000 prediction — if only for a few seconds 
Anthony Pompliano, a former product manager at Facebook, is managing partner at Full Tilt Capital, a North Carolina-based early stage investment firm that is putting all of its next $25 million fundinto cryptocurrency startups. 
Pompliano said that while his firm focuses on investments such as cryptocurrency infrastructure and technology instead of the more volatile digital coins, he sees bitcoin's crash as a natural part of the market cycle. He stands by his prediction that bitcoin will reach $50,000 in 2018.
"I don't know if it's for four hours, or a day, or forever. I don't know if anyone can call that," Pompliano said. 
"If you ask most institutional investors, one of the most valuable aspects of bitcoin is that every time something has occurred that should kill it, it doesn't die and it comes back stronger," Pompliano added. "I think that element of bitcoin is incredibly powerful and highly underrated."
Pompliano said that part of the volatility stems from the same cyclical market forces that sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbling 1,700 points in two days. But, he said, bitcoin is traded globally and can swing dramatically upon news that another company or country has decided to support it, or ban it. This means that cycles, both good and bad, happen a lot faster in the world of crypto. 
"I would say historically, it has proven to be very difficult for individual retail investors to time markets. So what I have told people close to me is, if you want to buy an asset, buy it, hold it and don't look at it," Pompliano said. "Don't try to day trade highly volatile assets like crypto."
Invest in the technology, not the cryptocurrencies 
Robin O’Connell, the chief revenue officer at the currency exchange Uphold, was less bullish in his assessment of bitcoin's price, but he said that he doesn't see cryptocurrencies going away any time soon. 
"Anyone you talk to who says they know whether this is the bottom is giving you their best guess. Who knows," O'Connell said. "If you as an individual believe that crypto is here to stay — and obviously at Uphold we believe that — then [you believe] at some point this is going to correct itself."
While critics of bitcoin often complain that there is nothing to back up its value, O'Connell disagreed. He said that the problems it solves, such as international money transfers and blockchain-based smart contracts, justify the use of cryptocurrencies and prove their value. 
"Those things are to me the underlying fundamentals of whether this thing is successful or not — not how many people are betting that the price is going to go up," O'Connell said.
As the broader market took a beating on Monday, bitcoin believers took to Twitter to speak out in defense of their cryptocurrency:
After watching bitcoin for months I’m completely desensitized to 5% intraday swings. 

For the Dow? Biggest points drop ever. 
For bitcoin? Eh average Monday.
— Austen Allred ( February 6, 2018
 
As impressive as this Bitcoin “bubble” was, after the ensuing recovery, which could take many months, the next Bitcoin run that breaks past $20k will be majestic...
— Vinny Lingham ( February 6, 2018
Perhaps the most reasonable reaction was that of venture capitalist Fred Wilson, who has written about cryptocurrency investments in the past. 
Asked by Business Insider why he thinks the bitcoin crash happened, whether bitcoin can rebound, and if there are any lessons that people can learn from the last few weeks of price drops, Wilson responded with an epigrammatic email:
"1/ I have no idea
2/ I have no idea
3/ easy come easy go"

Faucets are a waste of time.
I'm leaning toward MultibitHD being the most newbie friendly wallet for windows and it automatically makes encrypted backups to your cloud drive service.  Mycelium for Android.
Good luck and remember, make the paper backup of your wallet ASAP.  Keep it secret, keep it safe.

The price per 1 bitcoin is kinda irrelevant.  Just invest an amount of currency that can be afforded and don't get hung up on interger values. Ultimately even a satoshi is an arbitrary division anyway.  I know this doesn't really answer your question.

Well, I think when he referred to "them" he was referring to businesses (because the purchasers would be anonymous).  I don't think I'd be opposed to a system where only the corporations/businesses pay tax.  At the end of the day the anonymous individuals can still decide where to spend their money, and therefore how much tax they pay via their purchases.  If you belong to a completely self sufficient group, in theory you would pay no taxes.

Yes in a fireproof safe and ideally printed on waterproof paper with a laser printer.  Multiple copies is a harder decision as this introduces a security risk if you do not have direct control of all the copies.  The backup is the only thing that guarantees that you will have access to your Bitcoins if you lose your phone or otherwise cannot access your wallet. Do not make an encrypted digital copies. Anyone that gains access to this backup can steal your wallet.  Keep it secret, keep it safe.

The amount of gold Canada had left to sell was minuscule and economically irrelevant.  Coinbase only represents about 15% of the trade volume anyways so not a big loss.  Canada has a really great bitcoin exchange industry, and bitcoin exists in a virtually unregulated environment.  Bitcoin will do just fine.

This is the unregulated wild west of investment.  Most advisors would probably assess it as extremely risky and akin to gambling at a roulette table.
