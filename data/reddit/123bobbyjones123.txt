There is no way to have a users signature check any part of the scriptSig. In this code, there is OP_CODESEPERATOR which would have allowed signing of transactions to be delegated. 
Peter Todd went in detail about this on the Bitcoin talk forums 2 years ago.
Also the original Genesis block hash is different here then in the source code released visible on Github.

I would spend the $800 on past debts. Clear up your old debts and you'll thank yourself.

If bitcoin is a currency, why not use it as a currency? Why persist with the idea that we will convert it to the queens money so as to, as you put it, "reduce rick of volatility"? Why wouldnt the merchant be using bitcoin as he would any other money?

I have a business. I use Bitcoin. My business has nothing to do with bitcoin. I need to invest $3,000 into equipment so my business can grow larger. WIthout this piece of equipment, I dont know how much more profitable we can become. The bank officer does not take my "$3,000 loan" seriously. With BTCJam and the like I can crowdfund for the money and pay back in (x) months. The company has my bank account verified, social media verified, telephone number verified, paypal account verified.
This isnt a commercial for companies like this, but their are real uses.
Spam e-mail is an annoyance. What if one said "E-mail is a bad idea, just a way to be spammed by corporate cock smokers".

No. For one, Bitcoin has taken off. Bitcoin 2015 compared to Bitcoin 2011 (not the price of a bitcoin, but its accessibility and acceptance) is like night and day. Secondly, we know who created Litecoin, Do you care who invented Litecoin? Does THAT matter?

Send all your coins to a myycellium wallet. Send those coins to BTER. Exchange for Doge. Send to dogecoin Core wallet. Send Doge to Shapeshift. Exchange for BTC. Send back to new mycellium address. Hassle, yes. Privacy, is better

Its disappointing Overstock sill uses Coinbase for their transactions. Theyve never really embraced the principles of bitcoin. In satoshis paper he argues that since commerce online relies on third party processors, we need a system where people can transact with one another. By using Coinbase, Overstock has used them as "VISA", a third party.

Lets say hypothetically bitcoin dies due to regulatory chokeholds and litecoin escapes by making some core changes. Lets now assume that Litecoin becomes dominant and the ONLY, again, the ONLY digital currency on the planet. 
Tell me, does it matter who wrote the code? or how much Litecoin they have? and if it does, please explain.

I had this same problem in florida during the St. Petersburg Bowl this past year. A bunch of merchants accepted bitcoin (via Bitpay unfortunately), and at one pizza shop there were three, count them, THREE, grown men standing around a tablet trying to learn how to do this weird internet money thing. There was a paper on the wall Bitpay gave them how to accept bitcoin. It felt forced. They never did get it working. The first sentence in satoshis paper is that online commerce has come to rely up third parties, Bitpay was the third party in this scenario. Had the people actual WANTED to accept bitcoin, the way you or I want to use it, then he would just send me an address and be quick and painless.

I run a full node, however,  halfway down the page you will see satoshis reasoning, and how only people attempting to generate bitcoins would need to run full nodes, and that mining will ultimately break down to specialized hardware used by "server farms". We're right on track

The discussion has been lively, sure, however their are some major flaws in the paper. I believe using testnet for communications might prove to be more difficult than it first seemed given the nature of "trust" needed between parties.

I plugged in a 2 gh/s bitmain antminer once to learn about mining and my best share was 6.27M. With 150 gh/s running solo 24/7 for months, the chances of finding a block are negligible, however, a small possibility is still a possibility.

I would suggest defining to yourself the definition of "need" as in I "need the funds". You can use your bitcoin to buy almost anything if your needing to make a purchase. Pay bills, buy house products, car, gas cards, gifts for others. Unless you need to pay the mafia cash, you could most likely spend your bitcoin on something the same way as your local currency. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer currency, use it that way. Its not a penny stock :)

Why recommend BitPay? Theyre like Mastercard in the sense of being intermediaries facilitating transactions? If you set him up with electrum or mycellium or a lightweight client like this he can receive bitcoins instantly no problem. With BitPay there is paper work because of US regulations, mycellium you just receive bitcoin with a button click. :) Kudos for changing the world, one person at a time
