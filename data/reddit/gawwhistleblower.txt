What is your btc address :D
@_date: 2014-08-21 16:05:51
I have more evidence that I will reveal.
@_date: 2014-11-28 16:53:35
1. They do not have enough hashes to cover everything they sold. It's like fractional banking but with hashes haha.
2. Yes it does as that is what is represented on the product page. To do other wise is misrepresentation. 
3. So you are saying it is ok to use shill accounts...
4. Most people will not be happy. The smart and ethical people will reflect and respond to concerns rather than just commit more fraud and hide behind lawyers like Josh Garza

Josh is known to use shills as he did here on BTCT:
He also actively bribes and threatens detractors like a dictator with an over inflated ego. This thread was real and josh either threatened the individual or paid him off to delete these posts. He is very good at making stupid mistakes but unfortunately has the money to dig him self out of them.
He 100% does not have all the hashes he has sold.  He publicly stated on Hashtalk.org he sold over 12m in scrypt hashlets. That would equal around 800~1000GHS of scrypt hashing power.
Tell me how he can hide that. Tell me where he has the power for that. That is over half the litecoin network...
Also, his supposed "zenpool" always had double the payouts 
until he realized that he can't support faked double payouts. That is when he lowered his payouts and tried to continue this ponzi with an ICO...
Also, non of the pool owners listed on zenminer sees any hashes from josh. Email them yourself and ask.
Regardless, this egotistical asshole is going to make us all look bad when the ponzi stops.
Remember, the guys on top of a ponzi scheme also benefits from continuing. That is why he has such a cult following sometimes.

More evidence will come. Stay tuned.
@_date: 2014-08-21 16:05:09
They created that forum because they could not handle the heat on bitcointalk.org. 
Hashtalk.org is a heavily moderated forum.
@_date: 2014-08-21 16:08:24
Yes, and this is detrimental to the bitcoin community. I believe people can do whatever they want and buy whatever they want.
It is the fraud that scares me.
@_date: 2014-08-21 15:51:02
He used sockpuppet accounts to fool people at bitcointalk.org. They are the poster child of censorship on the forum hashtalk.org.

Hi Theymos,
Can you point us to other GAWminer shill accounts such as the one here:
@_date: 2014-08-21 16:03:18
Do you trust a guy with mythical miners that promise to always ROI?
Who thinks creating sockpuppets is ok? 
@_date: 2014-08-21 15:54:02
If it is vaporware, customer should be aware of the risks they are exposed to. If the market some how turn in ways GAWminers.com did not expect and can not cover payouts....then what?
So the question people should ask is GAWminers actually selling virtual miners or a financial product?
@_date: 2014-11-27 08:33:01
 Profits are good for the guys on top of a ponzi pyramid. It is the suckers on the bottom left holding the bag that hurts. 
I think you are a shill. 
Jumples, You are always welcomed to refute my evidence with facts. 
@_date: 2014-11-28 17:10:06
Other cloud mining schemes/scams are outside the country. The scale of GAW is in the tune of over 120million dollars according to GAW.
They are also a US company with US citizens. If this company goes bankrupt it will just be more ammunition for people like Ben Lawsky and will hurt everyone in the community. Not just the people that bought into the GAW scam.
Also, have you read this:
@_date: 2014-08-21 16:09:30
No one deserves to be scammed. 
@_date: 2014-11-28 05:39:12
Also, forgot to mention, these messages ended up being deleted but we were able to get a screenshot before Josh Garza bullied the OP etc...
@_date: 2014-08-21 15:58:08
"We’ve produced a miner incapable of negative ROIs because the maintenance fees can reduce over time! Thats right, there will never be a time a Hashlet cost more to run then you make, and they will always make money."
"Hashlets will be the only miners that will be able to mine to the new ZenPool, the Most Profitable Pool in the World [...] that can deliver payouts almost twice as high as the top pools today!"
"Hashlets are upgradeable. How can a digital miner be upgradeable? Simple, because its digital and we built it"
@_date: 2014-11-28 05:33:11
@_date: 2014-08-21 15:52:10
Nope. I am a new person and might reveal myself soon. I am close to Josh Garza right now so I must stay private to protect my family. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 16:00:58
I might choose to reveal my identity in the future but as of now. I have a relationship with Josh Garza and do not want to jeopardize my family. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 16:01:50
If they just straight up said this was a financial product with no actual hardware backing them up then I would not be here. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 16:14:03
I am not selling a conspiracy theory. 
When Gawminers are claiming this: 
"We’ve produced a miner incapable of negative ROIs because the maintenance fees can reduce over time! Thats right, there will never be a time a Hashlet cost more to run then you make, and they will always make money."
"Hashlets will be the only miners that will be able to mine to the new ZenPool, the Most Profitable Pool in the World [...] that can deliver payouts almost twice as high as the top pools today!"
"Hashlets are upgradeable. How can a digital miner be upgradeable? Simple, because its digital and we built it"
What risks should be disclosed? 
@_date: 2014-11-27 23:20:17
We should let the law firm know what they are doing. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 15:49:16
The one million he had was after he was selling supposed "cloud" miners. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 16:15:11
I think the most effective way is to drop drip evidence. So stay tuned. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 15:55:09
Also, anything that assures ROI should be suspect.
@_date: 2014-08-21 15:59:51
I am actually very close to GAWminers and am not of those people. More evidence will come. Stay tuned. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 16:06:40
How do you know they have the miners? What proof do they give? 
What if they did fractional reserves as gavin said? 
@_date: 2014-08-21 15:56:01
Do your own google searches and searches on reddit. Please draw your own conclusions. 
@_date: 2014-11-28 05:35:01
Reactor is a stand up smart forum user. Much more moral integrity than the GAW criminals. 
He was upset because GAW promised a new Scrypt Asic controller that was going to revolutionize mining etc... etc... it had the ability to self heal etc.. etc.. 
People actually paid money for the software and it never worked. 
@_date: 2014-11-27 08:46:15
I love bitcoins and the great community. I just hope a few bad actors will not ruin it for all of humanity.
Also, I welcome anyone to refute my facts.
