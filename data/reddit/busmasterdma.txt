Do more research into the actual dangers of a 51% attack.  The most damage such an attack could possibly do would be to attempt a double-spend (of funds the attacker already controls).  And statistically the chance for success is quite low (and is actually even possible with &lt;50%, only even less likely).
This would have no effect on a national Bitcoin reserve.  If anyone (individual, corporation, nation state) is worried about 51% attacks, simply wait for a couple more block confirmations before accepting an incoming transaction.
Plus it isn't as if casually "someone would just 51% attack."  The size of the mining network is dynamic, and tends to grow with Bitcoin adoption.  Owning 51% of network resources would be no easy task today. Now imagine attempting that in the wake of popularity following an announced national Bitcoin reserve.

If you created that address through bitcoins.de, you should perhaps create one with the local client instead.  I'm not sure if online wallets support mining directly to their deposit addresses.  In theory it sounds like that would work, but I've never tried.

Good point, they are different scenarios.  A pool is surely a more complex operation than the faucet.  But still, given the historical records on payouts and a statistical analysis, one could develop a suitable algorithm of red flags and fail-safes.
An off-the-top-of-my-head thought: to send a payout, require a user to initiate the transaction on server 1, then also log-on server 2 (or respond to an SMS, email, etc from server 2) to approve the payout.

It depends on the configuration.  I've got hyper-threaded dual quad-cores, making for 16 addressable processors.  If I run a CPU miner with a maximum of 14 threads it allows for enough "breathing room" to not hinder my GPU performance.   
Also I understand the newer versions of the Catalyst drivers will use 100% CPU in some circumstances.

You could probably get a bit more efficiency by running a native miner instead of that Java miner, but you're still going to be limited by the hardware itself.

I would venture to guess that the pornography industry makes a good percentage of profits from automated recurring payments.  Paying directly with bitcoins would preclude this sort of recurring payments, so while a potential win for consumers, it would probably be seen as a threat to the industry's business model.
Edit: Of course chargebacks are probably high, especially for those easy-to-forget and difficult-to-cancel recurring payments.  Perhaps the lack of chargebacks could help entice the industry to adopt bitcoin.

Interesting.  An unscrupulous user could still claim ownership of a slightly modified version of the file, say for example 0:01 second longer, which would have a completely different hash.

Also light clients that don't locally store the blockchain whatsoever would work for some situations.
Also transactions can occur off the blockchain.  If one account transfers funds to another account at Mt Gox, it is never broadcast or recorded on the blockchain.  Or if someone hands someone else a Casascius physical coin, it was transferred but will stay off the blockchain until someone removes the hologram to redeem and spend the private key.

Based on those specs, the system sounds to be about a decade old.  Any GPU that old will not be up to the task of mining.  You could consider upgrading the GPU, but you will likely need a card to fit an old AGP slot.

The goal of combating media piracy and doing so in a decentralized p2p system seem to be at odds.  Verifying the rights to media content would always require a centralized, trusted authority.  Otherwise you would wind up with any user able to sell any content, whether they own the distribution rights or not.  
Plus such a system would still depend on the goodwill of a user not to violate the DRM and redistribute the media.  And if you're relying on such goodwill, again there is no point to using p2p cryptographic tokens.

Redacting a transaction in the blockchain would require recreating every block since the edited block.  Then again, since this proposal would require a change in protocol, perhaps the difficulty could be temporarily lowered in order to quickly recreate blocks to catch back up.
