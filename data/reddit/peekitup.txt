Like the same won't be done with crypto.

I go to someone who has a lot of crypto. I tell them if they give me some crypto now I will give them more crypto later. They trust me for some reason and accept.
I take that crypto and hire a few guys who will do what I say for crypto. I go to you and tell you to transfer all your money to me or me and the guys kill you.
On a large scale that's called war.
The guy with a lot of crypto either collects his interest from me or hires more people to kill me.
Same shit different currency.

As soon as crypto becomes wide spread and fiat becomes a thing of the past it will happen. 
Not saying it's happening now, where'd you get that from? 
It doesn't matter the medium of exchange, people will always threaten other people for personal gain.

Are you focusing on the elderly because they're easy to take advantage of?

Except how everyone measures Bitcoin by it's USD worth.  
If the decentralized sentiment wasn't true then there is no crash ever. 1 bitcoin is 1 bitcoin, why care about how much USD it can get?

"Person who would benefit from people buying bitcoin and who will sell out when it hits 50k tells everyone else to buy now!"
Such a misleading poll.

Earlier this year I could buy a loaf of bread for X USD. Today I can buy that same bread for X USD.  
Earlier this year I could buy a loaf of bread for X BTC. Today I can buy that same bread for 2X BTC.  
Enough said.

Earlier this year I could buy a loaf of bread for X BTC. Today I can buy that same bread for 3X BTC.

Then why measure bitcoin's value in fiat anyways?
People want stability. If I buy goods and services with a currency, and for no perceivable reason those goods and services cost twice as much of that currency in one year, I would call that currency unstable.
I don't know about you, but I'm paying similar prices for gas and food and rent and luxury goods right now as I did at the beginning of this year. If I had it all in bitcoin, I would be paying a lot more.
