Remember that the first 10k of capital gains are tax free. So unless you're looking to cash out a lot there is no tax due.

It is certainly not just trolls. IMO the 2mb HF altcoin will be a minor curiosity if it materializes at all. I doubt I will be adopting it other than perhaps to make more btc by selling off the altcoins.

I guess if it is illegal the law doesn't specifically mention localbitcoins.com, so most likely all such services would be illegal.

One problem is that the trezor wallet and I think also the firmware updates go through cloudflare. I guess the firmware is probably signed, but the NSA probably has the signing key already ;)
Edit: actually signed firmware is not required, just if it's unsigned then the bootloader will delete any existing seed. But if the user upgrades their trezor before using it then there is no way for them to notice if cloudflare injects an evil unsigned firmware. Also cloudflare could downgrade your firmware to a buggy/insecure (but signed) one while doing an update.

I haven't used it, but AFAIK Gemini has no GBP pair so using it probably means a swift wire and currency conversion. It might not be too bad but I doubt its better than trading in EUR on kraken, bitstamp etc.

Its OK to celebrate segwit activation by segwit2x while still hating segwit2x ;)

They don't need to though and won't.
@_date: 2017-06-20 11:14:05
Uasf bip148 just activates segwit. Segwit is going to activate anyway by the original 95% signaling by the segwit2x miners. Once they start orphaning non segwit blocks it will go to 100% signaling for segwit. If these segwit2x miners switch to mining an altcoin {2mb hardfork coin) at a later date that's their own affair.

Not sure but if you form a company in the us or EU it would be able to open an acct at any bank. It doesn't cost that much but maybe more than the fees to use a local bitcoin exchange depending on how much money you are spending.

Segwit2x is a hardfork, which means it is an altcoin. People will have to activitiely rewrite wallet software and install it to use the new altcoin. While this is going on the old bitcoin will still exist and will still be working fine albeit with possibly a lot less total hash power. Except now it also has segwit and soon some ln - perhaps initially providing free instant intra exchange and debit card transactions. I don't see how segwit2x gets off the ground.. Time will tell
Edit; thinking about it some more it would probably take a year or more before segwit2x became popular enough to get 1mb full blocks ;) the idea is ludicrous

Simple; Lightning transactions also require your private key.
@_date: 2017-06-18 12:12:58
Why leave? Segwit is now pretty much guaranteed to activate.. The only slight niggle is the potential for a loss of hash power if bitmain leaves, but there will be new generations of faster mining hardware and more newcomers entering the mining space to pick up any slack.
@_date: 2017-06-18 12:46:22
It remains to be seen if anyone switches over to segwit2mb, personally I doubt it very much. The miners can agree amongst themselves to switch, but just because they do us a favour by activating segwit before they leave doesn't mean anyone cares what they do after.
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:56:58
I doubt it.. Any attacks could be litigated or even prosecuted criminally. Plus they haven't threatened that and I don't think it would make people more inclined to join their new altcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-17 15:33:30
Agreed. Both are fictional characters and it makes a mockery of the justice system.

I would suggest getting a mortgage (yes I know you said..) Btc will probably keep going up and the pound down so it makes a lot of sense. You could also just not buy a house and keep renting.. Even throwing all that btc away on rent you might have enough for two houses one day.
@_date: 2017-06-20 10:41:46
Segwit looks likely to activate. Segwit2x is a hardfork and the only way to "activate" it is for you to install it. Meanwhile bitcoin running segwit will continue as before.
@_date: 2017-06-11 10:31:45
Maybe 
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:37:38
They can't take anything. The max block size increase can only ever happen on an altcoin. They've said they will activate segwit and it will remain activated if/when they leave.
@_date: 2017-06-18 13:50:04
That probably isn't strictly necessary, however it may well be the simplest option. There are probably discount flights to Cyprus that wouldn't cost a lot or take much time.

Segwit fixes the transaction ids and kind of provides a path for some additional future upgrades. It turned out that it could also allow more transactions per block since the signatures were now relocated out of the block. We have bip 148 because people are tired of waiting for the miners to adopt it.. I think it would have been better to wait but it seems that the threat of uasf has worked (as it did on litecoin) to get the miners to implement and activate it. Why do we have segwit2x? I really have no idea. Maybe to demonstrate failure? Like maybe its good for bitcoins decentralization to demonstrate that none is in charge (even tho such a psyop would have been carefully planned).. People are indeed using altcoins but they still use bitcoin. If the 700 altcoins have so far failed to displace bitcoin how likely is the 701st going to do it? You think copying peoples balances over will do it? Its been tried before.. It'll get some interest but not enough to take over and maybe not even be in the top 10..
@_date: 2017-06-18 18:21:59
I think the fees won't push people to use an altcoin that few others are using and the ln can quickly be deployed between custodial exchanges/wallets greatly reducing on chain transactions.
@_date: 2017-06-16 14:13:40
I'd say no. Credit cards attract high fees. Open a USD or EUR bank account instead. If you can get an EUR account at a bank inside the EU or ECC that would offer the most options.
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:06:20
I don't think its any easier and it definitely costs more in fees. Just use your bank account.
@_date: 2017-06-20 10:47:36
Control is not lost because you have the option to settle your payment channel as an on chain transaction if your counterparty becomes uncooperative.

There isn't really an NFC bitcoin wallet standard yet. Mostly people use qr codes and maybe Bluetooth. There are a few pos terminals. Try
