Can you enlighten me as to why you had to post it as a separate submission, not as a comment in the appropriate story?

That's what QR codes/NFC are for.
Transaction confirmation time is a bigger problem with paying for a meal with bitcoins.
@_date: 2011-05-26 22:48:20
The difficulty determines the [target](
To generate a block, you have to find a hash that's lower than or equal to the target. So if your (or the network's) hash rate is R hashes/second then you will on average generate R*target/2^256 blocks per second.
@_date: 2011-05-25 15:24:50
It is theoretically possible to have mining pools that don't get to decide what transactions are signed ([see here]( but from what I understand such model comes with bigger overhead and therefore might never be implemented.
@_date: 2011-05-24 16:20:31
I'm no authority on this, but here's how I understand it.
Let's say the attacker spent some coins in block N. Say we're now on block N+5, so the other party considers the transaction confirmed and ships the ordered goods (or whatever). Now the attacker decides she wants to spend the same coins again. Since she has access to machines with superior hashrate, she tries to make alternative blocks N, N+1, etc., in which the coins in question are transferred to some other address. If she manages to overtake the original legit branch, then the network starts considering the new branch to be the proper one (the network prefers the longer chain) and the guy who got the coins in the original branch is cheated out of his money. And she _will_ manage to overtake the other branch if she has access to more hashing power than everyone else combined.
@_date: 2011-06-09 02:27:32
That's not a fee, that's the threshold after which the pool pays you.
@_date: 2011-05-18 12:52:13
It is based on the length of the current 2016 block round and the network's current speed.
@_date: 2011-05-18 10:35:20
So why did you say 4 in the title when you arrive at 2 in the submission text? Also, the current estimate is lower than that.
@_date: 2011-06-30 17:44:49
Well, I'm arguing for argument's sake at this point, but the fact that inflation is there by design doesn't mean that it's good. Nobody here is accusing the government of printing dollars _by accident_. The fact remains that they're printing them and pretend that they belong to them, not inject them in random places like Bitcoin does. I'm not an economist, but since you pretend to be one on the Internet, the burden of proving that they're not stealing my wealth rests on you. The fact that it's part of the currency's design doesn't mean it's not a scam, it just means they're shameless.

At current rates? At least two months!
@_date: 2011-05-24 17:37:57
Yes, and the amount of time (number of blocks, really) is up to the receiver to decide. The official Bitcoin client shows a transaction as "unconfirmed" until it receives 6 confirmations (which should take about an hour under normal conditions).

Obviously Bitcoin price needs to stabilize for long term success.
Illegal is such an arbitrary term. Do you know that online poker is illegal in many countries? It doesn't even need to be strictly illegal, say I want to pay for porn or donate to Wikileaks, but don't want everyone to know.

They invested their time. It doesn't even matter if it was a big sacrifice on their part. What matters is that everyone could do it, just like everyone could buy AAPL at $4. It has nothing to do with Bitcoin's long term success.
@_date: 2011-05-17 17:26:34
The receiving party does not participate in the transaction in Bitcoin. The sending party announces that it wishes to transfer money and the network's consensus confirms that the transaction took place. You don't need to turn your computer on until the moment you wish to spend your money.
@_date: 2011-05-23 00:11:44


Why? I can make a copy.


That's true. Longer chain wins. But that also means a lot of transactions thought to be confirmed get thrown away.


They get thrown away as well (the ones from the shorter chain). Mining is just a transaction with no "from" address.

It's not like the bug only manifests itself if the amount is small.

@_date: 2011-12-11 01:10:11
You don't actually even have to be connected to the network at all to "receive" Bitcoins. See, your ownership of Bitcoins is not anything that happens on your computer. It's about the network's consensus.
You sure do have to be connected and synchronized to spend them though.
@_date: 2011-05-17 17:29:13
Yes, and get a newly minted 50 BTC in addition to the fee. The chance is slim though, unless you have a beefy ATI card in your computer. Or four of them.

Um, that's just how Bitcoin works. You can create a new address for every transfer if you want.

I see they subscribe to the impressionism school of circuit board design.
Seriously, why blur the picture if their biggest problem is that no one believes they're legit, not that someone steals their design by looking at a photo of the board?
@_date: 2011-06-13 16:06:53


They don't work very well if what you're buying is considered illegal by your government (like, say, online poker chips).
@_date: 2011-06-01 16:33:11
Perhaps. And perhaps there will be no disagreement about the proposed solution, which will be implemented well ahead of when we actually need to drop SHA-256 and the end user won't even notice.
@_date: 2011-07-04 15:03:21
That's OK, established macroeconomists never agree on anything either.

It's almost identical to the established logo.
As for its use as a currency symbol, let's just use BTC.
@_date: 2011-06-16 21:54:56
You're correct. It's still an absurd design decision.
@_date: 2011-06-01 16:06:16
Nothing centralized about it. If there are two or more competing solutions then the network will decide. Hell, for all we know there might even be a split.
@_date: 2011-08-12 15:13:49
What's to stop me from giving you a "bitbill" and then spending its contents using a copy of the private key?
@_date: 2011-06-09 13:53:10


No, I meant their personal human brain time.
Again, it doesn't matter if there was any risk. Bitcoin's success is not dependent on whether the early coins were distributed in a manner deemed "fair" by some obsolete economist. In fact, that's the genius part in the design. Bitcoin is/will be a success exactly because it gave incentive for people to take part in it. It just confuses people like Adam Cohen, because they expect financial systems to make bankers and governments rich, not kids in their mothers' basements with too much spare time.
tl;dr 1. It doesn't need to be fair. 2. It _is_ fair.
@_date: 2011-05-23 12:48:50
And that's probably where the guy on IRC got the idea.

Not really, it's just for pre-paid top-ups. You can't pay your bill with Bitcoin if you're a post-paid subscriber.

They're different things, Raspberry Pi is a general purpose computer running Linux, about as powerful as lower end smartphones. You can connect things like a keyboard, mouse, monitor, Ethernet, wifi and Bluetooth dongles to it directly. Arduino is a microcontroller with very limited processing power and memory. It is very cheap and good at interfacing with hardware though. Also it has an easy to use IDE to write software for it.
There is some overlap in that they both have GPIO pins, but they're really not the same thing.
