Thanks. More will come later!
@_date: 2018-10-11 12:42:46
I have some ideas for a next challenge to include rewards for the less technical solvers. 
@_date: 2018-10-11 13:41:07
I think I underestimated many of you but I see it as a positive thing. Now I know I can beef up everything and make it more difficult next time. The next challenge will be totally different.
After registering you have important data and I would consider this part ONE of the whole thing.
@_date: 2018-10-04 15:19:26
Yes, you can.
@_date: 2018-10-04 15:38:48
UPDATE: 
At least someone is right on track. (The 0.1 BTC has been moved)
@_date: 2018-10-04 11:38:31
People are posting hashes to the "hidden" page url.
Let me tell you one thing:
Don't bother posting there if you don't know how access the 0.1 BTC.
(You won't be able to provide the correct hash yet)

If you were scanning or trying to hack the site you might have been blocked.
If not, please be patient. The site is under heavy load.

Good morning all.
First of all I  want to apologize for not answering all emails.
You guys were asking me about financial advice, money for startups or family, a headstart by providing a good tip, or other strange questions. I could not even understand all of them. I can not help everyone, please accept my apologies! Someone was very very angry at me and blamed me for a lot of bad things that happened in the world. Sorry man, I can't save the world! :(
I can not answer all those emails personally, I'm sorry. I will try to answer those that deserve a reply as soon as possible.
Important updates:
\- Last night the first successful registration happened. Many of you know what I'm talking about. If not: keep going!
\- About 4.5 hours later the second wallet (0.2 BTC) was discovered. The funds moved to  
I don't know who solved it, yet, but I will certainly reach out to the first (and only, for now) registered email address.
 
@_date: 2018-10-02 13:55:45
Hints will come if I don't see progress.
@_date: 2018-10-03 18:01:54
Someone donated 0.00000546 BTC to the puzzle main address.
I have no idea who.
@_date: 2018-10-06 13:10:12
There is no need to send coins in order to proof ownership.
Please verify the signed message in a wallet like Electrum instead.
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:49:09
I never changed the original image, after going pulic. I don't even have one of 1850145 bytes.
How does the EXIF data of your 1.8Mb image look like?
@_date: 2018-10-02 13:54:10
You should be able to verify the segwit message signature in, for example, Electrum
@_date: 2018-10-09 21:22:14
The email address is on the website. And I can tell you for sure it is working. I do get a lot of email lately.
@_date: 2018-10-07 19:07:16
I wonder why people are sending tiny amounts of BTC to the main challenge address 
@_date: 2018-10-04 11:36:19
I downloaded the website template from a free template site.
@_date: 2018-10-11 14:08:32
The puzzle was made with only one reward in mind : 310 BTC.
Then I thought it would be too dificult and I did not want to watch it for years myself.
For this reason I added smaller rewards in between. They acted more as a checkpoint and not necessary as a reward but I had to name it.
@_date: 2018-10-11 16:43:22
The next one will be totally different. They won't have an advantage because I won't be reusing any previous methods.
@_date: 2018-10-11 12:40:28
Yes, I agree now. In my next challenge I will again hide multiple rewards but maybe split even so that there are like 5 equal prices. 
This one even overloaded the server, running on an SSD. Too much people were working at it. The server load dropped massively after the 310 BTC was found.
Clearly less people are trying for the 0.31 wallet now.
@_date: 2018-10-05 14:24:12
Over 10 people asked the same question: can I solve the riddle by printing it out on paper and looking for clues while on the bus.
Let this be my first hint: Partly
@_date: 2018-10-11 16:45:35
Why are people sending emails to me in their own language.
I don't speak russian, german, french and god knows what the other languages are.
I get too much email. I won't google translate them.
@_date: 2018-10-04 12:59:30
It's too early for hints my friend :)
@_date: 2018-10-02 13:56:46
No, there is no reason for me to do something like that.
@_date: 2018-10-02 13:57:25
It's too early to give hints already :)
@_date: 2018-10-09 16:08:16
Registering is not important but might help because it confirms something.
@_date: 2018-10-10 19:48:47
A couple minutes ago a notification came in:  **310 BTC has been moved**. 
Wooooow. I did NOT expect this to happen so fast!
The first registrations were coming in since yesterday and I expected the next steps to take a fair bit longer.
To my surprise the registration count increased from only 2 registrations (a couple hours ago) to over 130 (now) in a very short time frame.
Clearly a big group of enthusiasts are working together sharing their insights or some important findings were publicly shared somewhere.
I'm very surprised and impressed at the same time. For my next challenge I can clearly beef up overall complexity.
Congrats to whoever moved these 310 BTC !
( **And I would love to hear back from you! )**
Note: the 0.31 BTC wallet has yet to be solved.
@_date: 2018-10-11 14:09:25
Please send an email, if you did not do so already.
I might get in touch at a later time.
@_date: 2018-10-04 14:35:12
The form does not expect the hash of a private key. That I can tell you right now.
It already received over 20K hashes so far, from all over the world. It's just pointless trying to find a valid hash for it if you don't know how to access the 0.1 BTC.  You can consider this as a small tip (and save yourself some valuable time)
@_date: 2018-10-11 12:46:25
I can not answer this question without revealing part of the solution.
@_date: 2018-10-09 21:24:27
I don't know who solved it. I tried to reach out but no reply so far.
@_date: 2018-10-11 15:06:40
The guy who solved the 310 BTC reached out today.
He wants to stay anonymous because he doesn't want the internet to know who he is. It's understandable too.
A couple messages later I learned the guy worked alone but he used input from chatrooms dedicated to the challenge.  He said we should call him "Marc" and he will do a write up later. (I asked to wait until the 0.31 BTC one is solved)
Congratulations Marc!
NOTE: I'm surprised the 0.31 is still there?
@_date: 2018-10-09 21:33:34
At first I just loved the idea and I played along. Later I started to actually believe it would become accepted one day.
@_date: 2018-10-02 16:29:14
As said before: no hints rights now. Only if it takes too long and no progress is seen.
@_date: 2018-10-02 16:38:03
Hard to tell and it depends on how quick you are with all the necessary steps :)
Don't expect to find it in just a few hours or days but if you do, you're very good!
@_date: 2018-10-10 21:16:02
I will most certainly do so but at this moment the 0.31 BTC wallet is still unsolved. 
I'm surprised because I thought the solution to the 310 BTC wallet was the most complex one.
@_date: 2018-10-10 21:28:44
I will certainly do so!
@_date: 2018-10-11 12:43:57
The next challenge will be a totally different one. I have some good ideas.
@_date: 2018-10-02 18:45:08
At this time I can confirm the 3 addresses still contain .1, .2 and .31 BTC
@_date: 2018-10-11 12:43:29
Not likely
@_date: 2018-10-10 15:17:32
\- I had to make changes for the website because it wasn't able to keep up with the amount of visitors. Let's hope it's okay now. I never expected so much interest!
\- "aaron99" claimed to be the solver of the 0.2 BTC wallet (and he or she proved it by sending the correct private key).
\- 3 registrations so far. I can feel the heat!
@_date: 2018-10-11 12:45:00
I want to know who solved it :)
18 people emailed already claiming to have solved it but none of them were able to sign a message or send the private key as a proof.
@_date: 2018-10-08 11:07:08
This is beyond my control, let's hope people stop doing this.
Thanks for not locking without prior warning.
@_date: 2018-10-11 12:36:12
The next one will be totally different.
@_date: 2018-10-11 14:06:09
I personally expected it to last a bit longer too. And I never expected so many people to work at it in such a short time.
@_date: 2018-10-02 16:30:52
This one I can tell you: there is no O (ooh) but only a 0 (zero) if there's something that looks like an O or 0
