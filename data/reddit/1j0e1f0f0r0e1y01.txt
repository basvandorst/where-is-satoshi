My lazy correlation referencing publicly traded corporations that were reformed during obamas presidency because of the embezzlement that occured throughout the decade? Keep trying

Why because the social elites were embezzling the nati ok ns natural resources and putting the ordinary folk in squalor? How has the US had a hard on for Venezuela? Is it because we didnt give tax payers aid money to them?

You failed to mention how america affected venezuela. Were talking about venezuela. At least i proposed one legitimate example for my arguement. Stay on topic.

Ya embezzlement by social elites. If it wasnt socialism the what was it?

Capitalism is simply a facet of our constitutional democracy. Just like we do have socialism built into our constitutional democracy. Such as our military. You just keep going with the degrading comments, because your just proving who the asshat is

Its cute, your name calling, really! How about you try to be a adult and have a relevant conversation! Everything youve said is moot. Simply because your a immature 12 year old.

Do you have any substantial evidence. Sounds like a personal opinion. How do you take a high road with a unreasonable child?

Lol, you triggered

No you inbred, its called embezzlement. After the social elites stole the wealth from publicly traded corporations such as Petrobras(pbr ticker) and many others with vast natural resources the social elites printed enough money to collapse the financial market resulting in hyperinflation. Same thing happenened in germany after WW1 with a few small variations. So take your "simple fuck" mentality and try explaining manufacturing dissention.
