Yes you are right. While I can put the Android in-app application in the Google Play Store, most developers integrating it will have to use alternative delivery methods for their apps. There are a few exceptions to this in the in play store's T&amp;C, allowing purchase and download of content that is consumed out of the app (like music downloads).
@_date: 2014-12-09 17:17:52
I have an Android in-app payment system using Android (similar to Google Play in-app). From a technical perspective, it's fairly straight-forward. My first problem had to do with latency on blockchain so I moved transactions for purchases off-blockchain. This required creating online accounts.
These online accounrts resulted in the second problem, 80% drop-off rate since users did not want to create an account. Latency and transaction costs for virtual goods and micropayments are tough to solve using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-12-10 19:31:45
I'd like to thank everyone who gave feedback on this issue. It was very helpful in understanding why the drop-off rate is so high. I think that I underestimated the need for privacy among bitcoin users.
I've decided that I'm going to replace the auth system with bitid (or something like it) to keep the user anonymous. I'll drop the google+ features. I'll encourage users to just put small amounts of bitcoin into the Skubit system to do micropayments for in-app.
@_date: 2014-12-09 23:05:40
My understanding of Bitcoin Wallet in-app is that it allows the 3rd-party app to call an intent which opens a view, such as payment request or send payment. This meets the minimum definition of in-app, is on the blockchain and doesn't present any additional privacy concerns. Do you know if people use this for virtual goods (say levels within a game)?
@_date: 2014-12-09 02:28:22
This provides a way for 3rd-party Android applications to offer in-app purchases (for virtual goods) using bitcoin. In fact, it uses the same API and security model as Google in-app billing for Android. Mycelium and Bitcoin For Android are basically just ways to send and receive money, not an inventory and purchase system.

I did transition this over to BitID Authentication. The website is complete:
I still need to get the new skubit mobile client out and integrated. With hope, this will reduce drop-off rates.
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:58:35
I was struggling with this initially, as there are some drawbacks of using BitID for authentication. For me, these mostly centered around the performance and around re-inventing the wheel. 
Ultimately my decision for using BitID came from the fact that we can tie in these login addresses to the blockchain. This is really the exciting part. 
I’ll throw out a rough and incomplete example. I've been working on a system that embeds into blockchain transactions Firmata commands for controlling a motorized robot (Arduino). So say User A logs into a server with BitID address 1z123. He’s anonymous but I know there is only one user it could be. 
Now on the server, User A configures which motorized bots (or other things) he wants to control. Off blockchain, User A tells Thing 1, Thing 2 and Thing 3 to listen on the blockchain for address 1z123. Using BitID auth these Things can also verify that 1z123 is who it says it is. These Things will not listen to any address that can’t verify ownership. Now User B sends some bitcoin to address 1z123 with embedded Firmata commands. Thing 1,2 and 3 see the commands embedded in the blockchain and executes them. User A collects his money for allowing User B to control these Things.
@_date: 2014-09-25 23:33:26
I implemented something similar in Java. Basically, it performs off blockchain micropayments between users, with user initiated payouts (or withdrawls). I like the close channel concept you have as a way to commit the transactions.

I tested this with BitID Authenticator app on Android and it works for sign in to the website! Very cool to see sites supporting this.
@_date: 2014-12-08 22:20:53
Its more like a hybrid (like Coinbase). The reason for needing a login is that users can transfer money into Skubit and then can spend and transfer off the blockchain. But maybe this isn't clear to the user so they have the same concern you have.

According to Google Play's Terms under certain conditions, a developer does not need to use Google Checkout:
"Developers offering additional content, services or functionality within another category of app downloaded from Google Play must use Google Play's in-app billing service as the method of payment, except: where payment is primarily for physical goods or services (e.g., buying movie tickets, or buying a publication where the price also includes a hard copy subscription); or where payment is for digital content or goods that may be consumed outside of the app itself (e.g., buying songs that can be played on other music players"

Good point, next release I'll have it auto-selected to last created address so at least something is always selected.
@_date: 2014-12-08 22:59:00
Thanks for the feedback. Based on the numbers, I was suspecting this was the case: using Google Plus is a big privacy issue. I'll likely remove social aspects of the app. Since this is also micro-payments (in-app/virtual goods), the latency (10 minutes) for blockchain transfers is a serious problem, as well as transaction costs. Hence the need for online accounts and fast off-blockchain transfers. Given the constraints between fast micro-payments and privacy, I'll need to figure out the middle ground here.
@_date: 2014-12-17 20:39:20
The example you have given is one of the use cases that BitID protocol handles. You can try this out with the BitID Authenticator app. In the Android app, there is a login button that opens a camera view. 
Just point the camera on your phone at a QRCode displayed on your computer's web browser. Try the sample site ( The QRCode contains the BitID and reading this initiates the login flow on the phone. Once you have logged in from your phone, in a couple of seconds the web browser on your computer will show you are logged in there.

That's pretty much how it has to work since users aren't going to want to wait 10 minutes to buy the next game level because of blockchain confirmations. This needs to occur off-blockchain.
The important thing is that it's not converted to some other virtual currency (points) that you can't get back out of the system as bitcoin.

The paper is just applying a test to tell if there in brown noise in the bitcoin market data. It's not attempting to predict anything. With fractals you can also do tests for pink noise. It's called noise because you are looking at the distribution of the errors around some model. White noise would be error data that follows an exponential distributions (like the normal distribution). 
The reason this is interesting because if it is brown or pink noise you can attempt to find hidden signals. You know the errors are not random (normal distribution), they may have some pattern. 
The problem is that fractals are better for detecting low-level, long range dependencies within the signal. So it's rather hard to predict something like the stock market, as the fundamentals shift before you have enough data to make use of the hidden signals. I wouldn't even attempt using such things for currency market predictions but it is interesting to find out the types of noise that exists.

Price doesn't really affect most services, volatility does. So as long as bitcoin stabilizes at a lower price, it won't make a difference to people who use it as a currency; and in turn, it won't make a difference to VCs or their funded companies. 
Personally, since I'm building a site to sell digital goods, I'd rather see small fluctuations around $100, than big swings around 10K. It would make developers more comfortable that they wouldn't lose value between the time of the sale and the time of the payout.

Skubit does virtual inventory management for the developer (similar to Google). So everything is managed. If you take a look at the APIs Skubit provides, you can see there is a fully managed inventory for the developer. 
With Skubit, developers also have an app store for delivering apps. 
If you look at dcpos APIs, you see a few calls for making an invoice:
So that's why 0.5% is probably about right for dcpos's level of features.

Google is brutal if you stand in the way of their business model. In 2008, there were some guys (formerly of paypal) who provided in-app billing prior to Google even providing a billing solution.  Google yanked all the apps off using the in-app library within a week. Now that everyone knows that bitcoin is a currency with value, selling virtual items with bitcoin in the Play Store won't get far.

15% is half of what Google/Apple/Amazon take.
If any company says they aren't taking any percentage, then they are a charity funded by donations (which is fine), OR they are a company that will go out of business and leave their customers stranded OR they have some other core focus that they are trying to drive. 
Businesses that don't make money, don't care about their customers.

I'm not seeing a lot of overlap in the approaches. As small companies, we need to collaborate where we can before all the 800 pound gorillas move in and start dictating how things are done. Bitcoin is such a huge and growing market, the pie is just getting bigger.
If any devs are using the PC POS, you have a place to upload and deliver apps at skubit.
By the way, I'm planning on releasing Charon into open-source. That's gateway to F-Droid repos that would allow companies to host repos not controlled by Skubit. The front-end Skubit developer portal would call these gateways. I'll post more info in the future.

There is a historical reason for having free apps on Android. When the Android Market was being developed, T-Mobile offered to have their operator billing used for the Android Market launch. Google refused (as they wanted to build out their own payment solution). 
So that meant, Android Market launched with no billing at all. Many developers had their paid apps ready to go at launch. But they were so scared that by the time Google got around to introducing billing, alternative free apps would have gobbled their market share.  And they weren't wrong.
It took 6 months for only a US/UK billing rollout (and the rest of the int'l developers were still releasing free to compete). By this time, all users expected apps to be free. The damage was already done.

It is actually decentralized. The Skubit market client allows you to configure different F-Droid repositories and to add and delete content repositories. OR different mobile clients can access the Skubit repository directly. OR third-parties can host copies of the repository.  
You can even share apps between two devices hosting either a Skubit or F-Droid Android client.
So it's about as decentralized as you can get.

If you look at the Android app for SQRL, a lot of people love the concept, but are commenting that they wish there were was a site supporting it. I was unable to find one myself.
I think it is a tough sell for most companies to implement SQRL due to the majority of their users being already trained on password based authentication. 
The argument in the corporate meeting would go something like this:  For a lot of work, we can implement a system which let's us know less about our customers, Oh and these customers all need to either own a mobile device or need to install browser plugins on their computer. We have to develop those extensions too. Good luck getting management buy-off on that change.
The Bitcoin community is more fertile ground for these types of authentication systems. Users don't want to hand over all their personal info. QRCodes and scanning are already natural. It's a much smaller leap. Once it's proven out in the Bitcoin community, the rest of the technical community will see how obvious of an idea it is.

Yes, good point. It could provide a lot of revenue to developers.

Yes, depending on the reason for the increase that could be bad. Rapid increases in price of assets, without a fundamental reason for the increase, other than speculation, puts the the asset in a risky category. It's more at risk of tumbling back down. 
If however, the price increase were due to a non-speculative reason, say if China were to approve bitcoin for merchant purchases, then the price increase would be a good thing.
@_date: 2015-01-31 01:42:56


Yes, even if they circumvent it, they can upload to the store. If you look at the (short) history of skubit, I released the IAB first and only released the store last week because every app store I tried to collaborate with told me they weren't interested.

So to explain how fractals are applied, what your would do is create your base model (say a time-series model that has nothing to do with fractals). You would look at the distribution of errors around that model. If it looks like a normal distribution, test it. If it comes up with brown or pink noise, you can start scaling predictors of your model until the distribution removes the noise. In that way, these scaled values have extracted the hidden noise and been properly modeled.

You re right but even 1% is too high for managing a currency, which is a single asset. It doesn't require the same level of research and maintenance as a mutual fund. The list of risks on their site is extensive, including a common one usually in fine print in many funds:
"The BIT’s fees and expenses−which may be substantial regardless of any positive return− will offset the BIT’s trading profits.:
So they get 2% maintenance plus collect substantial fees that you never see. I'm not sure if they have "exit" fees but that wouldn't surprise me either.
Some people may think this is balanced by tax free status but the truth is it's not even close. I'd stay away from this fund.

I've had the same problem on reddit when I post anything technical I've done with Bitcoin. I struggled with this for a while.

I'm just failing to see anything that backs up the premise that volatility is necessary for adoption. What I see as supporting arguments are: masses buy high so other (greedy) people increase development of the eco-system to take advantage of them. 
What this would also mean is that when people stop getting screwed, the system collapses (dot com fall, housing fall). 
This sounds like Wall Street all over again. So under whatever system we adopt for currency someone has to get screwed for it to work? 
I'm more optimistic than that. I think just building value for the user is enough for survival of bitcoin as a currency.

Ok, then I would agree you, real increase in price valuation is good for Bitcoin. I think you and I have different definitions of volatility, which is causing some confusion. Statistically, volatility would be measured around the real growth trend (otherwise it's considered infinite and meaningless). So you kinda need to separate the two.
@_date: 2015-02-23 05:16:13


If Smart Contracts increase the value of bitcoin to the next level then that's real growth, it doesn't have much to do with volatility (which statistically is the standard deviation).  
Still I believe I understand what the OP and you believe, that volatility drives outsiders (or the mass) to buy at high levels. It's a fear driven thing that one needs to buy now before it goes up further. This is a very old pattern starting from the tulip mania in the 17th century till the more recent housing boom. But what I truly fail to understand is why people think this is a good thing for Bitcoin.

Sadly, this is true. I'm actually the former founder of SlideME and in the beginning we fought for every developer, every developer mattered. The only way to survive was good word of mouth from happy devs. And that involved talking with devs and finding out what worked and what didn't.
I exited the company after a few years but have kept an eye on the forums and what people say about SlideME and it's horrible some of the things I've seen developers reporting over the last couple of years.

It's Google's rule. Donations is a general term and the IRS further breaks down the types of donations for tax purposes. It can be qualified or non-qualified. 
If it's a non-qualified donation (taxable by the IRS) or a donation to a for-profit organization/company, Google is saying they need their cut. You are making money so they want some of it too.
If it's a non-profit charity (which in this case will be qualified), Google will do 'No-Evil' and let the charity have 100% of the money. You can imagine how bad Google would look taking 30% going to poor kids in Africa.

Thanks for the information, it's interesting. I'm not all that familiar with the players in this area. It looks as though PrimeDice also has an good API to develop against, although the documentation is rather skimpy. 
When developing, I was a concerned to find that the SatoshiDice JSON responses allow illegal escape characters. This caused my parser to break when someone had embedded such an escape character in their alias. We all know the security concerns around injection on websites; and with the secret key on the URL, this could be a vector of attack. So the site could use a good scrubbing.

This is interesting because it MAY preclude any form of bitcoin payments within apps, even for physical goods. It seems to indicate alternative payment methods must be in a web browser.

These sorts of security problems and changes in policy will tighten the screws on developers being able to develop interesting apps with the APIs. It may be better for Coinbase to just dump the APIs completely and focus on security. It's very hard to navigate both openness and security when users deposit so much bitcoin with them.
From personal experience, I did the initial version of Skubit's IAP based on the Coinbase API. I had it ready to after months of work.  Before release, I went to test new user creation and found Coinbase had changed the flow for mobile login from about 4 steps to over 15 steps (that doesn't include user registration). 
I e-mailed Coinbase about the problem and they responded that the steps were necessary for security. Obviously, I couldn't launch with such a bad user flow. That's when I decided to just setup my own Bitcoin node so that one company couldn't kill my business overnight.

Volatility as you are discussing here is caused by an inefficiency of the system. By inefficiency, I mean the classical economic definition of not incorporating all available information into the price. If someone comes up with a more accurate pricing, they make money while also reducing inefficiency, which is good for the system. The original post seems confuse things by taking the stance that volatility (inefficiency) is good because it drives development. In fact it is removal of inefficiency (and money made from that) that drives development.
