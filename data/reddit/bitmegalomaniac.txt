As has the efficiency of ASIC's by many orders of magnitude.
More importantly, at the time no one was seriously mining with GPUs let alone CPUs.  The first generation of ASICS had been out for close to a year and that were literally 100 times more power efficient.  
If the authors did not want to be seen as a hatchet job they should have used what was actually being used in their figures instead of what was being used years before.

That article is using GPU's and CPU's to generate the hash rate.
The only ASIC they include is the Butterfly Monarch that was (even at the time of the article) probably the most inefficient ASIC out there but even so, they base the figures off CPU/GPU only.
It would definitely be interesting to work it out today though but I suspect that article is another of the hatchet jobs of the time.

More nodes from different entities definitely help.
A pile of nodes from one person, while not hurting the network don't really help with the decentralisation of the network.  It does help in finding routes though.
You will probably be doing more service to the network with one well-funded node though instead of many poorly funded ones.

You use the private key to sign the pubkey (and any other data) to create the signature.

I had actually thought of that.  Those parts of seeds that I give out have a few copies and I tell them to keep them in separate places. Because it is only part of the seed one bit of them getting out won't compromise the entire plan.
So, in the event of both me and one of my beneficiaries dying in a skydiving accident the other beneficiaries will have to get the part of the seed from the one that has died's bedside draw or wherever it is kept.
This is why you need to be crystal clear about the entire thing, everyone needs to know what the words are, what they look like and who has them.
You, of course, run the risk of your beneficiaries conspiring against you and stealing your bitcoins... but I like to think my Mum at least would put a stop to that (my brother might want to though, but my sisters routinely will go in the opposite direction that he wanted to go as a matter of principal).


I am watching this space with great interest (and contracts generally).  We can do them now but they still require the beneficiaries to hold some sort of knowledge in the form of a key.  It could also be done with a n of m multisig but that will make my using my bitcoin painful while it is in that address.

I finally worked out that while I was discussing things in good faith your were a deceptive troll who had no intention of being honest (lack of self respect or personal integrity, you choose).
It is actually quite fortunate that you guys tend to be like that (dishonest).  It means that anyone entering bitcoin with an ounce of integrity can work out fairly quickly how desperate and dishonest you guys are thanks to threads like this.
It is why you guys are getting nowhere (and slipping backwards), there are just so many fraudsters like yourself around anyone entering an honest conversation is likely to come across one of you and find out first hand what you guys are really about.

First, get your IBS under control.  I have its big brother Chrones and I am very familiar with all of the shit (pun) that it puts you through.  You need to do literally anything to get it under control first and from what you are saying you have no control at all.  See your doctor and start experimenting with all of the (prescription) drugs that are available, quite a few people have some success but it takes time to hit on the right combination (and realize they the combination will change as your bowl does).
As I say though, that takes time and you can do something in the meantime.  Give up smoking (if you do) and work on your diet.  Eat only rice and drink water for a week, if that does not help, only eat pasta and dring water for a week, if that does not work only eat potatoes and dring water for a week.  Fish, eggs, protein shakes... just keep trying stuff, one at a time until you find something.  (Stay away from dairy though...)
I know it is boring and it is a hard diet to stick by but you really need to do it.  What you are looking for is what kind of protein won't give you shit (pun again).  The fact you are still alive means that there are at least some protenes that don't set your guts off even though it may not seem like it at the moment.
Once you have that shit sorted (pun again lol) you can get back to deciding what to do about everything else.

That not really a good argument.  Remember, to get on there is a recommendation by the community to newbies.  Just because they are currently compliant it does not mean the community has to recommend them especially since they have a long history of doing things badly.
Think about it, if you were new how would you feel if I recommended you to use a wallet that I knew had issues and you lost money?


Just supporting something else was not the issue, what they wanted to do is make the decision for you as to what is bitcoin and what wasn't.  That is about as anti-bitcoin as you can get.
Having said that, feel free to make a pull request to put them back.  I would recommend having a better argument than "They seem OK at the moment" though.  Bitcoin.org has a responsibility to give out as best as possible advice that it can give (or at least not hand out bad advice) and "ok at the moment" won't float most peoples boat.

No, every node counts.  Even though you have pruned most of the blocks you have verified the state of bitcoin (called the UTXO or unspent transactions outputs).

@_date: 2018-01-17 00:01:04


I don't think you understand how that works.
Let's say, I only ever open channel one LN node (instead of just picking one at random every channel open like you should) that node doesn't get to know who I am or who I am paying.  That is the same amount of pseudoanonymity provided by bitcoin network transactions except it is limited to just one node.
@_date: 2019-07-14 22:37:36
Segwit has saved on a lot of fees yes.
The network is now processing more transactions than ever while having lower fees than in its peak in 2017, mostly due to segwit.  Blocks are now permanently over the old limit of 1 MB and more an more people/organisations are switching over.  However, there are no magic bullets and every change made comes with upsides and downsides.
Increasing the blocksize further (it will happen) is one of those things that should not be taken lightly because the flipside to that particular coin in decentralization.  People tend to forget that the limits were put on for a reason and while they were intended to be temporary, the reasons for those limits have not just seriously dissipated.

As I said, there is no reason to always open the channel with the same node **BUT** since you like doing that even in that instance you have better pseudoanonymity using LN.  I say it again, your partial 'pseudoanonymus identity' is known by that one node and not the entire network.  They don't know who you are, they have NO WAY of knowing who you are transacting with.
With bitcoin, the common ledger &amp; change addresses allow anyone (not just one node) to uncover your 'bitcoin stash' via the change address and can use those same techniques to uncover who you are transacting with.
Neither is possible with LN.  
@_date: 2018-01-01 05:50:01
You put all the relevant data together using the transaction template, here is an example:
You then encode the transactions in bytes and use your private key to perform a ECDSA signature to complete your transaction for broadcast.
That is the gloss over version!

Perhaps.  I kind of like my beneficiaries though and I would like them to have it.  You may be leaving your bitcoins to people you don't like all that much though :P .


I was not mean ing paintings in particular.  I meant the type of method that involves the solving of some sort of puzzle or some sort of prior knowledge needed.  Us meatbags have the tendency to think that 'common knowledge' or 'common sense' is some sort of universal thing that most people know or can work out.
The reality is that what is 'common knowledge' or 'common sense' differs wildly between individuals (even those closely related) so much that something you think is perfectly understandable or easy to work out could be totally decipherable to them (or even everyone).  It goes both ways, something they think you should know or be able to work out could be just as decipherable.
Every time I hear those words I roll my eyes.
The safest thing to do (providing you like your beneficiaries) is to make everything crystal clear, well documented and even (if possible and needed) find someone that can help putting the keys back together to access the funds.

For example, since mining is a DC process, it is the same electrons being used over and over again in a loop.  The power delivered to the miners is AC, so it is the same electrons going back an forth.
I suppose if you want to count elections multiple times you could add them all up but I fell like that would be an odd way of doing it since then are never consumed and then you would have to count all electrons all the way from generation to ASIC.

Recently a friend of mine went to buy half his mother's small farm with his sister and her family. 
The deal was that he would pay for half (Cashing in some bitcoin), and his sister would sell her family home, pay outright for quarter and remortgage for the other half.  All was good and her bank was up for it. 
He would have to go guarantor for her mortgage but he also had a full-time job as well as enough bitcoin to cover the mortgage if necessary.
Anyway, he goes into the bank to sign all the papers and hand in a list of assets, income etc.  When the bank found where he got the money to pay for his half &amp; that he had more, they denied his sister's mortgage.
He told me that the bank wrote a letter and sent it to both him, his sister and mother saying "Because XXXXXX has cryptocurrencies  this mortgage is outside of our risk envelope"
TLDR;  His sister's mortgage was denied because he has bitcoin.

Not only are you helping by doing the tests on your particular environment but those test cases also work through EVERY (well, close to) single bit of important bitcoin code from transactions to the block downloads to consensus.  It is the best place to get an understanding of how bitcoin works at a technical level and it will also teach you a pile about how c++ works.

OK, let's examine what lightning network node does, it:
* Processes transactions for anonymous users.
* Collects a fee for processing transactions.
Now, let's examine what bitcoin mining does:
* Processes transactions for anonymous users.
* Collects a fee for processing transactions.
What is the difference here?  Why would LN be subject to things that mining arent?
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:55:20


No, the payer pays the payee, what they are talking about there is the route.  It is how the payment is delivered, not who pays who.

There are no 'small blockers', that is the ridiculous thing about it (and you seem sucked in sorry).  They have drawn an imaginary line in the sand and proclaim everyone who does not follow their cult is a small blocker.
There are people who want to throw caution to the wind with something that we know won't work and there are people who want a cautions approach upgrading in a sensible and controlled manner.  Anyone who is keen on LN (most around here) knows that blocks sizes are going to get bigger but want to do an evidence-based approach to those bigger blocks.
@_date: 2019-07-09 20:17:55


No idea what you mean by that, transactions are not signed into blocks.


No, LN is no more complicated than bitcoin itself, less so even, it just does a small subset of bitcoin functions in order to do what it does.  If you have the level of comprehension that you can understand how bitcoin works you have understood all of what you need in order to understand LN (and some).

No, you can broadcast transactions without fees, just don't expect them to get confirmations.
The problem is at coinbase, the size of your transition is fixed so as long as coinbase is doing transactions the fee of your transaction remains the same in any given time period.
You may get support from idiots with an agenda when you say that it is because of the bitcoin network, but since your transaction hasn't even been broadcast it is something at coinbase that is the issue.

I suspect that most productive coders that can churn out good code when asked how to derive a curve will tell you "it is just vodo magic".  If you do want to get to those levels then, yeah, a PHD will help but it is really not needed.

Firstbits lookup.  Once upon a time, it was rather common to abbreviate bitcoin addresses down to a shorter length.  If you look at Casascius Coins the public address you see through the little windows is something like 1Czfd2 (not a real one).
You could determine the address by scanning the blockchain.  A lot of block explorers could do it and there was a dedicated site (  ).  
I just looked around for a block explorer that still supported it and found:

While I do get what you mean, I think you overstate the problem a bit.  Managed correctly you can transact with a high degree of anonymity.  While people may be able to see your transactions they don't know they are your transactions and who you are transacting with.
Even better, technology coming online right now (Lightning Network) makes it so your transactions are not broadcast at all and no one but the receiver really gets to know anything at all, and he only gets to see that he received funds.
A new technology coming (Confidential Transactions) will allow you to do something similar on the main chain, but that is not here yet.

It is one of the unfortunate thins about using a custodial wallet like that, they get to set the policies as to how you spend/send your money.  There is an old saying in bitcoin, if you don't control the keys it is not your bitcoin.

That is despite has locked contracts not being used and 60 seconds on in that video the presenter saying so and saying why.  It is easy to see that your knowledge of LN is based on what the fools over in say instead of real knowledge.

What safeguards?  I am beginning to think you are misunderstanding how transactions work.
Either way, you need to create outputs for all of the bitcoins in a paper wallet in order to spend them, there is no way to just spend some of them.  You could transfer the change back to the same address but I don't see how that is any different than sweeping security wise.

For any that are actually interested in following what is actually going on (and there is a lot), try the mailing lists, IRC or slack.  There is plenty of discussion going on that you can participate in (don't be an ass though).

Blockstream is.  Microsoft is already in the game.  Regardless, it is an all or nothing thing, and if bitcoin is successful they all will be, we cannot make different rules for corps we like and dislike.

Good idea, we could make it so that back and forth transactions can cancel each other out as well as skipping the intermediary's like you say.
You could also use it so that you could enable 0-conf transactions because they can be on the network without actually hitting the blockchain for confirmations.
Ohh, micropayments too... you could literally send a satochi to a device like a lamp and get it to turn on...  we should call it "The Lighting Network".

There was most definitely a fork.
Two chains were being worked on at the same time, both had miners and users following them and it lasted for over 30 blocks and without intervention, both chains would have still been around today.

This is really what gets me, I want to know what people who are deep in bitcoin development have to say but I have to go all the way to the bottom to find them because people abuse the voting system to censor what they don't agree with.

I would like to add one (not sure if anyone will agree with me).
**Attempting to influence Bitcoin Development.**  No matter how 'good' the corporate is they should not be trying that on.  Individuals who happen to be in corporations, fine, but when you get the actual companies trying to set bitcoin policy I think we should draw the line.
I am sure Goldman Sachs will be very happy if we go down that route.

Jeepers, from the other two responses it seems bitcoin users are idiots.  We are not all like that though.
Sure, it would be entirely possible to geofence a wallet so that it can only be used in a specific location (like your house or some random address that you go stand to access your wallet) using a rather simple GPS receiver in the device.  While it is possible to spoof GPS they would have to know your chosen location and have enough technical ability to do so.
@_date: 2015-12-22 02:31:51
I would be surprised if they do, that whole thread is phrased as an attack.
EDIT: It is also blatantly obvious as I read further that most of the questions are nonsense, like this one.

From the article.


Keys for (most) mobile wallets are kept in the device's secure storage.  For good reason, not even apple, Samsung, Google etc have access to the users secure store.   
In order to decrypt this data that they are after they need to backdoor into that secure storage.

Not so much... Copper the element being heavier than iron is (mostly) made through a supernova.  So, copper that we have on earth first had to be 'brewed up' in a sufficiently large star to be ejected. 
It then has to spend a few billion years floating around in interstellar space before being coalesced into our sol system and into earth ~4.5 billion years ago.
So, at a conservative estimate, the copper we have on earth has been around 6-7 billion years old.

There is that, but it still leaves you in the position that your coins end up in a state that instead of being just tainted with your legitimate coins it ends up being tainted with everyone 'less than clean' coins.
I tell you what is going to make this sort of thing a lot easier though, LN makes transactions between users that don't (and will never) show up on any chain in the form of discrete transactions.
You will be able to load up a channel, spend it wherever you want, and then close the empty channel.  No associations with anything apart from your upstream node and even they won't be able to tell what you did with the coins.
@_date: 2018-08-19 04:30:16

No worries.  :D .
While, it is not a guaranteed solution it is, by my reckoning as someone in the devops industry with decades of experience, the best solution we have at the moment.
I also think you may be exaggerating your point a bit, while I have seen plenty of enthusiasm to a potential fix for the issue, I have not seen people guaranteeing that it is a solution.  So much so that significant volunteer developer resources are hard at work on other methods to help out with the issue (e.g. schnorr &amp; MAST).
If you frequent the bitcoin developer 'hangouts' you will definitely get a sense of this, very few are working on LN as the solution, and there are a lot of people chipping away at the problem from all sorts of angles.

flippant answer: depends on which bitcoin cash chain you are talking about.

SPV is anything that does not download to blockchain and verify everything.
There are many types of SPV and more than a few names (light wallet included) ranging from Full SPV (as defined in the whitepaper) to a lot of SPV'ish clients.  It is all up to how you implement your specific type of SPV and they all have various downsides compared to running a full client.
As a side note, at present, we cannot actually do SPV as detailed in the whitepaper.  When Satoshi first put bitcoin together he did not include something called Fraud Proofs that would make it possible.  Soonish though, we should be able to get them up and going with MAST and Schnoor.

I get what you mean, but it is a bit of a misleading way of thinking about it because of the way bitcoin works.
There are no bitcoins in the blockchain to update the state of, each new transaction is something entirely new to the blockchain.  I mean, you could think of it as a state change on bitcoin but Bitcoin itself does not think of it in that way.  It may lead to confusion when doing something like trying to find out what you balance is, you may think it is as simple as looking at the address and seeing how many bitcoins are in it when in reality you have to scan the transactions and add up the inputs.

I wonder where all of the "segwit won't work" people went?
I have seen a few of them saying "LN can't work" now, and a new crop of "XXX won't work" people but a lot of the original "XXX won't work" people have just disappeared.  I had them tagged in res to come back to after segwit was working...
Suppose they just made up new accounts in embarrassment after they found out they were wrong.
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:03:12
Simple explanation: Wait until it is confirmed and then give it a few blocks.
Detail: Any transaction not included in a block is malleable meaning that it can be double spent and you won't receive the funds.
It is well known, it is in the whitepaper and you should never count bitcoins as received until it has been included in a block.  Even then, you should probably wait for a few more blocks before you are sure because of the way blockchains work.  There is always the chance that the block was 'orphaned' (never liked that term) or that there may be a chain reorg (rare).
The safest thing to do is wait for it to be 6 or so blocks deep.

You keep bringing up the word "experimental", and that is fair, the whole ecosystem is experimental.
But let's look at what those experiments have told us so far, it has told us that bitcoin alone does not scale to billions of transactions daily that we require to become the global "go-to" money solution.
That does not mean the bitcoin experiment has failed, it just means we need to experiment more.  LN is that experiment.
If you have another experiment that you think would run better, please, do that.  In the meantime though, the rest of us will continue on what we think is going to work.

Not as a blockchain mechanism.  Changing bitcoin consensus happens outside of the bitcoin consensus itself, it requires people consensus instead of bitcoin consensus to agree on and make the change.
I know that sounds like double talk, I never liked the word consensus in computing, it should be something more descriptive like rules or something.  If it were called rules that sentence would read like this and make more sense:
Changing bitcoin rules happens outside of the bitcoin rules itself, it requires people consensus instead of bitcoin rules to agree on and make the change.

I don't see how... at least there is no facility for it without invalidating the entire blockchain from the update point onwards.

No worries :D .


Let's say you want to eat soup.  I suppose you could eat it with a knife but it would be easier, faster and safer (for what you are wearing) to eat it with a spoon.
LN &amp; Bitcoin is like that.  Bitcoin is great for a lot of things but it is not always the best tool in every situation.  If you want to make very small payments (micropayments) LN does that better.  If you want to to make time-critical transactions (instant) LN does it better.   There are other use cases like this.
For other things, where you need a "knife" bitcoin does it better (most everything else actually.. until someone invents a fork...).


So, in the metaphor, it would be like calling a spoon useless because it does not cut.  The spoon was never meant to cut, it was meant to spoon.
LN is meant for a set of use cases, it does them very well, but it does not replace bitcoin and its use cases.  Use the tool that is apropriate.

Pruning is not only native to segwit, so your scenario is applicable to any transaction so I will address it as such.
While node pruning had the theoretical possibility of 'loosing' transactions the set of circumstances that would have to align for a transaction to be lost (while theoretically possible) is highly unlikely.  
The following would have to occur:
* All block explorers would have to shut down (they cannot work with pruning on).
* All businesses would have to turn on pruning,
* All users would have to turn on pruning.
* All nodes would have to randomly decide to prune the same block (think birthday paradox).
So, yeah, while it is possible, a single user running without pruning totally negates the issue.

While some may be thinking that is an argument I would guess that most are downvoting you because you question has been asked **a lot** over the years.
However, since you are asking in earnest I will tell you what I tell people when they ask the question of me:
You probably should not invest in bitcoin, or at least not yet.  If you are looking for an investment opportunity (nothing wrong with that) it does not sound as if you have done enough due diligence to make up your own mind.  Asking random weirdos like myself on some internet thing is probably about the worst way to gather more information.
My suggestion is you spend more time looking at the fundamentals, what bitcoin is trying to achieve and how it can be of value to you and others.
Asking us numbnuts here you are going to get a totally biased point of view, we have (mostly) already gone through that process.

@_date: 2016-01-15 01:24:55
Let's say it is in your example, once group says 1MB and another with 51% hashrate says 1.25 MB.
Sooner or later someone will mine a 1.01 MB+ block, 51% of the network would say fine and mine on top of that block BUT 49% will say that block is invalid, reject it and mine on the previous block.
The 1.25 MB blockchain will never fork back to the other chain because there is more hashing power, the other chain will never fork to the other chain because it sees it as invalid.
You then have 2 bitcoin chains running in parallel each with only half the security and blocks that take well in excess of 10 minutes on both chains.
That example is oversimplified, the whole thing will be a lot messier than that.

A LN node can close a channel that is directly connected to it.
It cannot do anything to other channels that it is not directly involved it though.  It cannot even refuse to route for those channels without refusing all channels because it has no idea where the route originated from.

What about removal of misinformation?  After all, this whole thing started with a blog post (and subsequent thread here) by Mike Hearn entitled ["Why is bitcoin forking"](
These threads that are removed are all similar, they are making out that bitcoin is sing something that does not have consensus in order to raise consensus for it.
It is manipulation of the masses through misinformation, why wouldn't you remove it?

@_date: 2017-03-19 02:57:22
Well, there was a flock of seagulls...
Seriously though, how we got here was through a lot of bad behaviour, conspiricy theories, bad math and an outright misunderstanding as to how bitcoin works.
Now the sides are so entrenched in their positions that all they do is regurgitate rhetoric at each other no matter how silly the rhetoric is and take every piece of news as evidence that they are right (using mental acrobatics to do so most of the time).
The thought that keeps going through my mind is:
**Bitcoin has now 'made it', it is a thing now and there is no taking it back, the only thing that can stop it is us and it seems we are determined to do so.**

Welcome to Reddit!
You need to read **a lot** more.
@_date: 2017-03-29 21:57:14


Yeah, but the two are not equivalent.  From the miners perspective:
* Not running segwit now = no implications.
* Not upping coin limit when needed by bitcoin unlimited = Not getting paid.
I know it if fashionable amongst some to point at segwit and bleat about it but every discussion does not center around segwit.  This is a separate issue, surely you can see the difference?

OK, lets address that part since it is the only bit you see.
It is your selectovision kicking in again, the line says:
"On chain transactions will be settlement, off chain will be p2p cash."
And you are reading it as:
"On chain transactions will be settlement **only**, off chain will be p2p cash **only**."
Once again, your vision is playing tricks on you, the rest of us don't see the two 'only' words in there.

As long as you are talking about the file been read-only, then yes.
Being read-only means that it can still read the keys.
@_date: 2019-11-21 00:19:15
Do you mean read-only as in the wallet file being read-only (chmod 444 or however you do that in windows)?
If so, without looking at the actual code, you probably can.  All you need is access to the private keys (xpriv in this case) and you can spend.  Your wallet probably won't be able to update anything (i.e. the change address) but it will still be there.

There are.  The cable termination points are secure facilities similar to server rooms.
If they managed to get damage from solar winds you can be fairly certain that every electronic device that you and I own (and anyone who does not live in a cave) is fried.  Some specialty designed facilities should be OK though (Bunkers etc..).
It will probably be the end of bitcoin... and civilization.

Coming from someone who probably knows why there is no segwit support that comes off a lot like a "take no notice of the man standing behind the curtains" statement.

Because, that is the extra hash rate that they will loose after ASCBOOST usage becomes public, instead of wasting it or doing a 10-20% drop when segwit come on line, they have been using it to prop up BCC!  Once segwit activate, they will have to switch it back in order to maintain the same level!
I am a tard genius!

I gotta admit, I am a bit disappointed with c-lightning as well.
Not for the reasons you mention, but because it reaaaaaly has problems with channel announcement.  Channels seem to just drop back to waiting for signatures for no reason I can discern and unfortunately, I don't have enough spare time to work out why.
There are a few threads on GitHub about it, but no answers, explanations or what to do about it.
**EDIT:** Just noticed your title, it is important to note, bitcoin core and c-lightning are not the same things.  Two different teams even, not under the same GitHub account or anything.

Not really, there are 2,100,000,000,000,000 avalible units of bitcoin (satoshis).
We could add zeros to that at any time by making them further devisable.  As long as we don't change the base using (1 Bitcoin) and just make it more divisible we are not even inflating it.

What we have now is actually just one of the many ways to implement LN.  While it is the one most actively developed there are others with other ways of doing it (MIT is doing one... for the life of me I cannot remember what it is called).

Pull it of and get it under your own control.
History is full of people thinking that everything will be OK with their chosen exchange who no longer have bitcoin.  It is also full of people that did not trust their exchange and still has bitcoins.
I have lost bitcoin in just about every major hack that has ever happened in the past 7 years but it totals to about 0.00010000 or so because I never trusted them for anything past dust.

Yah, I see your problem and it is exactly how you say, each of those individual inputs and outputs are really going to add up to a lot of you are spliting any decent amount down to 0.05 outputs.
Worse, if you ever try to collect them up you are going to lose even more because you are going to have to sign each and every one of those 0.05 inputs!  What is really working against you is you are doing what is called a dust attack by creating a very 'chatty' way to store and retrieve your funds and we have been deliberately making it difficult for you (i.e. expensive).
Segwit is going to make it easier for you (and easier on the network) but it still is going to be painful.  
However... do a google for schnorr signatures.  It is one of those upgrades that are in the books once segwit is done that will enable you to aggregate all the signatures into one.  That is when you will be able to do what you want cheaply.

You want to hear a funny story?  We are in the exact opposite of where I started from.
When I came in there was general agreement that the 1 MB limit was a good thing, people were worried that the blockchain was taking up too much hard drive space &amp; bandwidth and we were putting together a single semi-corporate entity (the bitcoin foundation) that would pay the developers because Gavin convinced us it was a good idea :P .
Oh, how things change, if it is not one thing, it is the exact opposite of the first thing!

Seriously though, it is one of those unlikely events like the internet disappearing that we don't really have a formalised plan.

@_date: 2017-08-14 07:13:39
Not really.
The issue is that if they don't have the transactions they don't know what they are witnessing.  You could just full them up with transaction signatures and since they don't know if they are legit or not you would just burn through their hard drive space.

Yep, at this point he is just fleecing BCC holders for cash.  I kinda feel sorry for them.  At this rate they will go though the entire 2 week difficulty adjustment in 5 days, get stuck with slower blocks and unprofitable mining for another difficulty period (3-4 weeks) and then he will be fleecing them again with 3 minute blocks.

I have the feeling that IOTA (and ETH for that matter) are going to soon be relegated into the "Why do we need this?".
Bitcoin is going to allow all of this functionality to be built on top of it so why are we going to need a less  supported, less secure, less functional alternative?
This is just my opinion though... but why do we need these separate coins to do a limited selection of things that bitcoin can do?

@_date: 2017-08-22 08:11:24


Indeed, you don't seem to understand what he means.
Miners have every incentive in the world to not accept or perform any fraud in their blocks because the full nodes will reject them and their block reward (and the energy expended to create it) will be for nothing.

It is entirely possible, but then they could just mine a full block of their own transactions.

Yeah, that is the theory.  
Who do you trust to publish it though?  Who do you trust to implement it?

That is why I answer that bit first, the longest valid chain with most proof of work will win.
It happens quite often with small chain reorgs and it is sort of "built in" to the system.  It is completely automated, reproducible and predictable.
If it went on for days it could be quite painful, hundreds of blocks could be rolled back and transactions reversed, it would be mayhem.  Fortunate that if it did... the world would be ending at the same time so we would not really be worrying about it, it is that zomby invasion that I will be concerned about :D.

Sort of..... but not really.
When I first started in bitcoin there was Bitcoin-QT or bits of paper.  At the time bitcoin was also worth next to nothing and a brain wallet was a good place to dump your coins so you could keep them off line.  Even then though, you had to be exceedingly careful because things you can remember tend to be things that are low in entropy and can be guessed and that caught a lot of people out.
These days with seeds, mobile and hardware willit you have a ton of choices though, so yeah, they are not what I would recommend anyone use.

Given time and the will, you *could* support segwit as it stands today, it is not impossible, you have just chosen not to dispute what your users want.

They are *mostly* the same but just implemented in a different way.  They started diverging a few months back and will continue to diverge until they are separate things.  As it stands, most wallets are still just full nodes with some functionality disabled and a few things tacked onto the top.


Not at all :P .  Bitcoin development is decentralised and people usually do what they want.  It can be a bit chaotic but in the end, if something is worth doing, someone will do it.


There are no plans (that I know of) to do anything like that in bitcoin, the base layer is totally separated from the 2nd layer.
@_date: 2018-06-19 01:45:43
If you have one sure (technically if it is your own node you get the fees anyway so the point is moot).
However, when you route through other nodes they still will charge you.  Not much, something like 0.001 of a Satoshi (or 0.00000000001 of a bitcoin or $0.00000067 USD at today's rates).
@_date: 2018-06-08 06:30:58
Hmmmm, might be hard, how much statistical and probability math does a 5-year-old know?  I mean look at the Wikipedia article of the poison process used it is full of squiggly lines:
Seriously though, if you don't want to wade through that (I won't blame you) here is the short version:
Because there is no central authority to time the release of blocks bitcoin mining uses a poison process in combination with the mining difficulty so that blocks happen every 10 minutes (or so).
It does not matter when a block was last mined, it could be 1 second or one day, the next block will 'probably' be in 10 minutes.
I realise that is a sucky explanation, but probability math is not always intuitive like that and it is not really something ELI5 works on.  I did go through a few youtube videos to see if I can find something if you are interested more (past the wiki page):

@_date: 2018-06-05 05:34:40
Look, I really hate ragging on you guys, I have recommended your wallet many times in the past.
The reason this conversation is going nowhere is that you're not listening, to me or your users.  I come from a development background and I am fully aware that sometimes you don't want to do something because somewhere down the track (perhaps years) it could be done better.  You have decided it is better for you to wait that time.
The thing is, you are not your users and it is your uses that make you successful, sometimes you have to compromise in the present, incur technical debt, and do something that your users really want.  You need to be paying attention to what your users are telling you.
Implementing segwit as p2sh is not the cleanest, a better format may be available (no timetable on schnorr so who knows when), do you really think your users are going to hang around for an indeterminate amount of time paying more for their transactions?
Bread has gone from one of the most respected wallets in bitcoin to one that people are... to put it politely... antagonistic against.  Surely you have noticed this, surely that is not your intention.
Soon it will be a year since sigwit was available, at present we still don't have even a draft for schnorr, it could be (and likely will be) over a year before we even see it on the test network.  Who knows what is going to happen in the meantime?  You need to listen to your users, take the bitter pill, and actually do what they are asking.

Nice theory but no, it doesn't.
The average citizen does not have access to all of the financial tools to combat inflation that the "old world money" do.

Yeah, it is an unusual way to develop.  Usually, as you say you can look at things as a whole to work out what is and isn't working.  With LN you can only gather data from your own nodes and extrapolate from there.
Developing where you don't get an overview of the output... tricky.

The issue is that the Core client and the Segwit2X fork client have a different version of what they think bitcoin should be, i.e. they have a divergence in consensus.  However they are similar enough that the transactions will look the same and even the client strings will be identical.
Sooner or later, this is going to lead to a fork and the potential of chain re-orgs, replay attacks, block withholding and all sorts of other shenanigans.
So, core have made it so that their segwit enabled client won't contact the s2x client directly and have to use a 0.14 client as an intermediary.  It means that it is unlikely that the chains will reorg unexpectedly and there is a better chance that a replay attack won't accidently take place.  Unfortunately, it is about all they can do to avoid issues because they are not forking, the s2x chain is.

It is a theory yes, we know what an inflationary currency is doing, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, the gap is getting larger by the second.  The exact opposite of what your theory says.

Hard to tell, routes going to the LN are undetectable from the outside so your never going to get actual numbers.
There are a few people who have tried to work it out mathematically but they are flawed because they are not actually using the routing system and just doing random guesses.
On top of that, at the moment there seem to be a few problems routing between c-lighting and LND (compatibility stuff opening channels).
I have had good success, once I had my node setup and well connected I had very few failures.  That is just personal experience though.
@_date: 2018-06-19 01:55:50
Lightning works down to the millisatoshi level, so one one-thousandth of a Satoshi.
It is why microtransactions work, it makes little sense to pay a satoshi to transfer a satoshi but it makes perfect sense to pay one-thousandth of one.
That is not fixed either, we could just as easily be using nanosatoshi (one one-millionth) without any changes to bitcoin and only minor changes to LN.
@_date: 2018-06-18 05:36:52


Nope, BCH cannot do microtransactions like that.  The fee would be hundreds of time larger than the payment.
It is rather ironic that bch users are using bitcoin and lightning to inform everyone that bch is better... even though they could not possibly use bch to use satoshis.place because of bch's limitations... but they have never been the most succinct bunch.

It does not support segwit.  It costs me more to use your wallet compared to others because it is sub-par. 


Samourai Wallet

Look, the excuse you guys are giving is inexcusable, I want a bitcoin wallet, saying that it takes too many resources that you're dedicating to tracking altcoins is ridiculous.

There are many address formats, not all block explorers support them.

@_date: 2018-06-18 07:16:42


No, that is exactly how transaction mailability works.
Without being able to guarantee their txid a process that depends on that txid has to find an alternative method to making sure that it can tell the state of a transaction.  While it is possible to do LN without a mailability fix it would be the beast from hell... and probably very unreliable.
@_date: 2018-06-08 06:13:32
The real issue with bread is they just refuse to do what their users want, add segwit support.
I tried to talk to them about it, they just don't get it.  They say they are worried about user experience but they don't seem to care about the user experience of paying nearly twice the fees everyone else.
Now they are an altcoin wallet with sub-par bitcoin support... and they think that is the best thing for their users.

No, we have the same definition of inflation, we are just disagreeing about the effects.

@_date: 2018-06-28 02:26:13


Nothing :D .
Two reasons for that:
1. They can't.  Onion Routing keeps all of that channel data private so only the sender and receiver knows WTF is going on.
2. It is one of LN major benefits that it is so private, so any 'peeling of the onion' harms that privacy.
We are jsut going to have to make do with the limited information that we can glean from running our own nodes and doing our own tests.


There are a few people out there that would love nothing better than for LN to fail and they are in overdrive spreading FUD about it.  While we cannot crack the thing open and see how well it is actually working, I can tell you that it is working and getting better at an alarmingly fast rate, I sometimes wonder if the developers of the teams actually sleep at all.
As problems crop up they are knocking them down very quickly.  The major issue now is compatibility and even today I see a few bugs were fixed.
@_date: 2018-06-02 07:25:45


I don't think you do, you have had this feedback for months from many people.  You know better than those people evidently.


How many chains have you added since then, you're telling me it takes more resources than them?  Please.

Actually... he is talking about asteroid mining, not some random asteroid dropping out of the heavens on us.
There is a huge push on at the moment to put together the technology &amp; resources needed to either capture near-earth asteroid or bring them in from the asteroid belt into earth orbit in order to be able to mine them.  That is why you see places like NASA and JAXA (the Japan space agency) visiting asteroids (and bringing sample material back).  It also ties in with the Planetary Society's research into light sail technology.
A single medium-sized asteroid about 1.6k (1 mile) wide is estimated to have about $40 trillion worth of materials on it, including a sizable portion of gold, platinum and other precious metals.
It is admittingly still decades away before we actually do it (conservative estimate) but the financial incentives are there, we WILL be doing it.

That is simply not true, bitcoin users want segwit... so you implement altcoins?  Where is the listing to users in that?  Your actual users want cheaper transactions and yet your off chasing the altcoin market?  
Who did you think your users were?  We are bitcoiners, you should be looking after bitcoiners first.  Your wallet is one of the most expensive to use, your not looking after us.


As I said, you have decided what is best for us.  Stop complaining if we decide your wallet is sub-par then.  It is your choice to make transactions more expensive for your users.  Live with it.

From personal experience though, I can tell you that just the basics (ie.e. housing a food) have gone from under 25% of my income back in the 70's to well over 50%.

Changing the state requires them to broadcast a transaction on the blockchain so they cannot do that without your wallet seeing it.

I am not sure why you think that.
If someone can build a chain faster than everyone else combined they can build a chain with empty blocks.  Other miners may make blocks with transactions in it, but they will be superseded by the longer chain with 51% of the hash power.
Since the longest valid chain is bitcoin, and the longest valid chain has no transactions in it, you have frozen bitcoin (i.e. nobody can transact).
Perhaps you mean some other mitigating factors outside of the 'one miner having 51%'?

Not really possible once they have been mined, you can burn during the mining process by not allocating yourself the block reward.
If you want to "Most likely" burn them forever sent them to an address that no one has the private key for like the eater address 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE .

You are talking about an altcoin wallet that has a sub-par bitcoin implementation.
If you want to become relevant to bitcoin again, pick your game up, the excuse given (It's too resource intensive to monitor many chains at once, with a rise in technical debt that isn't efficient.) just is not acceptable.
You are sacrificing bitcoin functionality to support other chains?  No thanks.

Not really, nodes can have any balance (though I am not sure that is what you are asking) so nodes and capacity are not tightly linked.


Capacity and the number of transactions are not really linked in LN, if someone is going to make a transaction, they will make a transaction.
I am actually really unsure of that you're asking sorry.
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:10:02
Oh, yeah, I can absolutely guarantee you that nobody running LN nodes (or bitcoin nodes) is making money.
Just opening and closing channels cost many many times more than you could reasonably expect to make for it (at the moment).  Bitcoin has been like this from the start, I am running a node for the good of bitcoin, not for the good of my pocket, just like I run bitcoin nodes.
Having said that, there will be a point where it reaches equilibrium similar to how mining has.  You should be able to run one as a business for profit in the future, but not just yet.
@_date: 2019-06-19 00:44:18

It is caused by overt ASICBoost.

@_date: 2019-02-13 07:40:49


I don't think you know what irony means ANYWAY.


You may not have noticed, but the fuller blocks get, the more miners make.  Users pay more for their transactions, that more goes to miners.


I am not accusing anyone.  I am saying that it is possible.  


No, I can't.  But your theory assumes that they are.
@_date: 2018-06-07 08:04:35


Only if they have the private key.
The computational power to reverse an address to its public key hasn't been invented yet (and probably never will be, it is a one-way hash, safe from quantum computers even).

@_date: 2018-06-02 05:10:43
You are mistaken, that is not SPV.
You have a workaround (Just has Samourai Wallet have) but it is still not SPV.  Without fraud proofs you cant (and don't claim to) validate block details so you are making the best guess you can.  That is close, but it is still a compromise, just as Samourai compromise.
This still does not excuse you for not implementing segwit because you're more interested in validating other chains though.  Until you fix that, bread is sub-par.

Direct observation, the math is easy to do though.


How do you know if miners HAVE been clogging the network?


How do you know that?  


You put forward a simple hypothesis, I was responding to that.  If you don't like portraying miners a stupid don't do it.


What conspiracy theory?  I am putting forward a factual case as to how miners could mine their own transactions without it being shown in the mempool.

And without a global mempool all we can do is speculate about that.  Pushing me for numbers or guessing yourself is not going to change that.
As the network gets stressed with more transactions, that number changes and not for the better.

@_date: 2019-02-12 21:34:59


That is wrong because the miner does not need to broadcast hist transactions to other miners for them to mine.
He can inflate blocks all by himself with no chance of others mining his inflated transactions.
@_date: 2019-02-12 23:59:33


You haven't thought through this very well.
Just the fact that a miner is mining his own transactions taking up block space, that would otherwise be taken up by other peoples transactions, means that the mempool is not being processed at capacity.

All good, I encourage you to.  To me, the privacy issues around traditional blockchains really focus on the sending and change address.  It leaks so much information to the counterparty.  Seriously, I don't really want the guy I just transacted with to know it came from an address with 10 BTC in it... especially if I am standing next to him!


Don't fall into the trap of thinking if you don't see a use for it noone will.  People have been doing that with Bitcoin since the beginning.  I think a lot of them regret that now.


As you say, going to do more reading.  Good stuff because LN is NOTHING like gift cards :D .

10 minutes for confirmation all going well.


I downloaded the new Lightning Labs mobile wallet today (I have a node, but mobile is cool), made a few transactions just for the hell of it.
None of the people I make those transactions with know who I am, they cannot use the change address to see much I have or who else I am transacting with.  The node I made a channel with (not mine) does not know who I am or who I just transacted with or whos address those bitcoin up in the end.

Depends on soo many factors it is ludicrous (bandwidth, latency, connectivity, peers, peers bandwidth, peers latency the list goes on).  Certainly enough for plausible denial that anyone is doing anything deliberately because it can happen so easily when everything is working as expected.  Just upping things by 10% will have returns for them


My assumption (and the game theory behind bitcoin &amp; game theory) is that every player is a rational actor that is going to attempt to maximize their returns.  
If a miner can see a way to make a bit extra, it is almost their duty to do so.  Bitcoin only works because of everyone acting in their own best interests.

As someone who runs a node, I can tell you that I am not all that worried at the moment.
The thing is with the "capacity" is that it is the theoretical maximum (well, half of the capacity is the maximum) of transactions that can take place right now, this instant.  After this instant's worth of transactions takes place, the capacity can be used again in the next instant.
It is not like everyone needs to close their channels and start again, that balance is always available from instant to instant.

@_date: 2019-02-13 07:20:00


I do like simplicity, but a miner would not do that if his goal was to make more money, he would include just enough of his own transactions in order to push up the fees for everyone else.
It would also be INCREDIBLY obvious if he was only including his own transactions, just as obvious as if he were mining empty blocks.
Miners aren't stupid, if one or more decided to do something like this they would be aware of the backlash from the community if they were found out.  They will be doing their darndest to make sure we don't catch onto them.

The way git works any changes to the repository needs to be committed along with a hash.  Without those commits and hash's, nothing works so they cannot just go in there and start altering code.
So, Microsoft, in theory, could override commit access on the repository and make a commit of their own to do something nefarious but a look at the changelog would show the commit.
That being said, there may be a flaw in git that we don't know about BUT since everyone else's copy of the repo is a full copy of the repo there is another backdrop of eyes on the problem there.
TLDR; Perhaps, but it would be obvious.

@_date: 2017-11-02 04:25:03


Unfortunately not.
Normally we are talking about consensus as far as people go.  As an example, you and I can agree on something and that is consensus, if we disagree then there is no consensus.  If you and 10 other people agree and I disagree then there is still consensus I am just not part of it.
However, consensus in computing is something different, it is a binary set of rules that is always 100%.  A computer cannot disagree with consensus it is either consensus or it is not.  Here is a little further reading if you are interested:
Bitcoin is actually a consensus algorithm that takes that a step further.  Most of the time you hear a developer talking about consensus he is not talking about people agree or disagree with each other, he is talking about the rules that make bitcoin work.
It leads to really strange statements that are still perfectly valid like "There is no consensus about consensus."  Or "the consensus is that consensus is wrong."
It gets worse when one person is talking about one consensus and the other is talking about the other consensus.
I often think that we computer nerds should start calling our consensus 'rules' just so we aren't so fucking confusing to everyone else :P .

Basically only by Roger &amp; his devoted followers.  Not a single exchange I know of refers to Bitcoin as anything else apart from Bitcoin.
The only reasonable explanation for that is that it is an attempt to deliberately confuse people into buying BCH instead of Bitcoin in an attempt to gain more BCH users at the expense of new people getting into cryptocurrency.  (If you have a better one, please do tell)
That is why people are saying it is scammy.
@_date: 2019-02-13 06:29:45


Perhaps none, perhaps you can bring it up by 0.1% a day for weeks and make it a problem.
Pointing at the noise floor increase and saying that is being caused by miner transactions or by network stress is speculation.  Without knowing what is in others mempool literally all you can do is guess about it.
(I also think one random dude saying one thing in 2016 is a poor metric as a starting point but that IS irrlevent, it is as good a guess as any)

A pattern that is being deliberately obscured you cannot definitively say what it is being caused by.
A pattern that may appear like what we are seeing now where for no obvious reason there is suddenly more transactions that are being processed.  Do you know why the mempool has suddenly jumped like this?  I don't and I cannot see any definitive way of saying.
I am not saying that it is the case that miners are introducing their own.  I am saying that we cannot know for certain just by looking at transactions and what we expect to see from the mempool.

Nope, any stats are pure speculation because of the aforementioned factors.  IF someone IS doing it all they have to do is begin below the noise floor and slowly ramp it up.  Once the network is congested the noise floor increases as they increase.
We cannot tell the difference between them and the noise because of the distributed nature of the mempool.

* At present there are ~450kb of organic transactions in a block.
* They are growing fast, about 2* per year with a log progression.
* Given above, in ~2 years we are going to hit the limit of doing transactions like we do today. 
Now, there are a few things we can extrapolate.
* No matter what the block size becomes it won't be big enough.
* Right now there are a few drawbacks to larger blocks (orphans, selfish miners, more free space for free spam).
* There are things in the works that in combination with bigger blocks will solve the transaction per second problem.
Follow me?  Bigger blocks are probably on the cards but we are not there yet, we actually have time to do things right.

Sure, there was the first, Bitcoin that set off on its evolutionary path.  Then people made alternate coins to fit other use cases or do things in a different way.
It has been that way throughout the history of crypto UNTIL people started using it to deceive.  The Eth people never said Eth is Bitcoin, the clam people (the first fork of bitcoin) never said Clam was Bitcoin.  Namecoin never claimed to be Bitcoin.
It is a narrative made up to deceive, don't buy into it, in the (hopefully) long future of bitcoin there will be hundreds if not tens of thousands of them, they are altcoins.
@_date: 2019-06-19 21:35:42


Again, no.
Just because you fork from bitcoin it does not mean you ARE bitcoin.  Some of these altcoins have pre-mines for god sake.
I would say that 90% of these forks are just outright scams (my observation).  Bitcoin has always been Bitcoin, altcoins have always been altcoins, nothing has changed.

It happens when a block is mined shortly (i.e. seconds) after another block.
Because the miner has not had time to verify all of the transactions in the previous block they mine an empty block until they work out what transactions are still available to be mined.

You're speculating.  You don't even know what the noise floor is or how much it fluctuates or how much network loading changes it but you have stated that as a fact.
You have no bases for that fact.  You have no way to gather data to support that fact.
Don't get me wrong I have no clue if it going on either, but I admit that and I can see that even if I produced a pile of circumstantial evidence based on speculation... I wouldn't believe me.
Without a global mempool we cannot see where &amp; who transactions came from.  There are TONS of reasons we may see a transaction in a block that we had not seen before.

That is just a way of thinking, you think your money is "tied up" in crypto?  I think of my crypto as being where I want it and my LN being where I can instantly spend it.


Yeah, absolutely.  One of the "improvements" I did not even mention is the cross chain capabilities, we can already do it with litecoin but the bar for entry is very low, all you need is non-mallable transactions and you can do very cool things with atomic cross-chain swaps.

Not really, he is under the misunderstanding that those 71 satoshis are somehow 71 of the satoshis in that original transaction.
Since there is no such thing as satoshis recorded in a ledger somewhere just inputs and outputs there is no way a court could say that those satoshis were used in that transaction.

So, coming to the conclusion that the recent blip was caused by miner induced transactions would be a relevant one?  We have no other explanation and we know it is possible.


It is inconclusive information though.


But we cannot know why.  Is it congestion?  Is it someone consolidating?  Is it miners own transactions?

And pushes up the available fees as a whole.


Technically, that is your opinion.  Don't start passing your opinions off as facts.


What don't you understand about higher fees?  What about pushing fees up to make more fees are you confused about?

Because if you see a new transaction in a block that was not in your mempool you cannot prove if it was one you haven't seen or if it was a miner injected one.
You can speculate, you can take baselines as you say, but as the mempool gets stressed and things go up you have no metric to say how much of that is network stress or miner induced.
Keep in mind, that they will also be trying their darndest to make sure that it is within what could be considered noise.
With a global mempool, you can be sure, without one, you can speculate.

I did see you said that, but using the attack in a different, more obvious, way is irrelevant.  It does not stop them from fulling blocks with their own transactions increasing the strain on the mempool.


By not processing transactions from the mempool.  What about this are you not getting?
@_date: 2019-02-13 07:07:21


I am.
I will give you an example lets say I am monitoring the transactions in blocks that I have not seen before and it is 0.5% (just as an example).  All of a sudden I spot a pile of blocks that I have seen only 50% of the transactions in it.
What could cause that?  Here are a few examples:
* Miners are mining their own tansactions.
* A reorg just happened
* A large entity has got a legitimate deal with a miner to m ine their transactions and are consilidateing
* IT staff at a large entity just triped over the ethernet cable.
* Russia just turned their internet back on
* My node has not been keeping up with transactions because my peers are having an issue
* An undersea cable just got fixed.
* The network is very stressed.
Some of those I will be able to pick out by detective work some of the time but there is enough doubt built into the network there is never going to be a time I can prove something without access to a global mempool.
@_date: 2019-06-20 02:58:56


But since we are talking about bitcoin, they are alternatives to that.  I suppose there is a case for saying they are all altcoins though.
This leads me to another thing about the whole situation, there is nothing wrong with being an altcoin.  It is this desperate clamour to "be bitcoin" that has come up recently that portrays altcoins as something lesser.  You certainly seem to be objecting to the term and until the "XXX coin is the real bitcoin" craze no one even gave it a second thought if their coin was an altcoin.
Most thought it was really good, it meant you had something extra to add or some new way of doing things.

It sounds good in theory.
The reality is though short-term thinking is exactly what they will do and it had been shown with the BCH EDA, they just switch back and forth according to what it will get them right now.
It is not new thinking that just came about with the miners, the Banks did exactly the same thing and that brought about the 2007 financial crisis.  They had the exact same motivation to keep the financial system healthy that the miners do today but that, as the miners are doing/will do, shat all over the system for short-term gains.

Something over contrived.  It actually reminds me of the if this and if that's and then I do this while holding my touring like this that the original anti-crypto people came up with close to a decade ago.
I can name several "what if" that apply to bitcoin and/or the tor network that is the basis of LN but I don't.  You know why?  Because I would be as guilty of FUD as you are.
This type of routing, despite your FUD has been around for decades now (longer than bitcoin) without significant issue caused by the routing despite people and governments trying to play your what if FUD game, and yes, they are constantly trying.
As I said, I still have not seen a serious proposal of how to deanonymize LN transactions, and I still haven't despite the FUD.

Because they have SegWit, and that is 4MB all by itself.
SW+2Mb would be 8MB blocks and a study the bitcoin classic developers did a while back *seems* to show that it all starts to turn to shit after about 4MB blocks. (Currently, the 'end game' for the current scaling plan is for 133 MB blocks but that is some time off)

At some point, it could be connected directly or connected through a series of hops.
The important part is that it needs to be connected to LN.  The internal routing will take it from there.

Sort of, segwit removed the blocksize parameter altogether and replaced it with a different one called block weight (set at 4 MB) and put more fine-grained controls on how the size is calculated.


We know that this 4 MB block weight won't last forever so yeah, in the future you are going to see more than 4 MB or some other innovative way to jam more into that 4 MB (Schnoor signatures for example).


If you have a good read of the lightning whitepaper you will find in the conclusion:-


So yeah, we fully realise that we are going to need to do more in some way or another.  While there is a certain dishonest portrait of that put out by some of the altcoin communities, the amount of data in a block has already increased and will do so again in the future.

They have, it is part of the misinformation channel's campaign to make you believe they haven't.
Segwit as a softfork is ready for activation and a 2MB hard-fork is ready to be pulled, that is what was agreed to and that is what they have done.  I know a lot in core are busting to get segwit out of the way so we can start looking at what/when/how the 2MB patch gets pulled.
However, I don't think anyone (rational) is busting to do 2 major changes simultaneously.
@_date: 2017-04-13 05:51:59


Funny, I don't think you know how bitcoin works.


No, it is 1 MB of transaction data and 3 MB of witness data.


It allows more transactions by allocating the bulky bits of a transaction (the signatures) to a different part of the block (the witness data).
Because the transactions are now smaller (signatures don't count towards the transaction size) you fit more transactions into that 1 MB.
Where on earth are you getting your information from?
@_date: 2017-04-13 23:07:54

I imagine he is talking about the probability of generating a block.  Greg has come out that it could be as much as 30% but probably closer to 20% of a short cut.
He might be about to come out that his implementation of ASICBOOST actually only works to something like the 10% or less (not that we could verify it).
I expect the community will rip him a new one of he has been holding up progress for 10% though.
@_date: 2017-04-13 06:36:00


Ah, OK, I can see where the confusion is coming from.  I apologize.  It is not entirely witness data and that is why I did not understand what you are taking about (there still has to be a transaction).
The transaction will still have to be 1 MB though (UTXO weight as 4 to the witness 1) so that does not change if we have segwit or not.

This latest attempt will fail like the past few, people who actually know what they are talking about are already saying 'no way' and even with the ridiculously low threshold set it is obvious that it is not going to be achieved.
What I do find disappointing though is that so many bitcoiners are swayed so easily to try compromise the system and even now, during the third attempt, you are clinging to a FUD campaign.  Manipulated is the word that comes to mind.

It really depends on what they set it too.  I mean, if they set it to 200 or 2,000,000,000,000 I expect them to ignore the new altcoin.
To further that, if they bundle it with a pile of other stuff that they don't like I expect they will reject that too (AKA the BU altcoin). 
If they change it in a sensible manor with well founded reasoning I expect that they will follow it.
They certainly wont "follow hashrate" just because the miners tell them to.

I think it is a fairly common phenomena and it is not really all that bitcoin related.
What deceives people into thinking that 'simple changes' are simple is because the base technology is actually very understandable.  Given a day or two of research you can actually get a fairly good handle on bitcoin and how it works.  Certainly enough to use it and explain the basics to your friends.
However, like understanding how the man gets to the moon and *really* understanding all the bits that go together to get it there are two different things.  
@_date: 2016-02-12 01:18:00
Perhaps if the people of the western world would stop killing them for a bit we could find out.

Assumptions, you are assuming that it was a minority of users (nothing to do with a minority chain).

There are two circumstances where the person that did not open the channel pays for the closure fee:
* The person who 'received' the channel unilaterally closes it without negotiation.
* The channel was completely expended.

A wallet will be able to perform a subset of LN operations.  Like open channels, send payments, close channels etc..
In order to do that, it will contact a node that will perform the routing maintain channel statuses etc..
If you did not have wallets you would have to be online 24/7 to monitor the channels, open and close and route payments.  That is impractical, especially for things like mobile wallets.  Most people will be running LN Wallets and connecting to the LN through nodes similar to the way people use SPV wallets today.

You can only tell if a standard 1xxxx address is compressed after it has been spent because it is the keys that are compressed not the addresses.

I see no evidence of this.


Some of the most robust code out there is C.  I have processes written in C (by myself and others) that have run for decades without modification.


C is as good a tool as any and far better than lots of others.
I am actually fairly agnostic on the C vs Rust thing, both are good choices for this but I do find that Rust programmers use it as a crutch a lot so they can write subpar code and it still works and while that is good it does not compete with something written C.  C has a tendency to bite if you do things poorly tending to force better code.

It is an artefact of being a decentralised system.
It uses a [poisson distribution system]( so that blocks happen ever 10 minutes on average but like any mathematical distribution of points in a Poisson system it can be more or less in the shape of a bell curve (ish).
Why it is like that is that there is no centralised authority out there in order to issue blocks on a set timetable.

Most users won't be running nodes at all, they will be running wallets that interact with nodes.
They will be able to open channels, send funds and do most of the functions that you will normally use.  The user will just load into a channel and use those funds till exhausted.
They won't need to be online 24/7 and they won't be hot wallets.  You will use them just as you use wallets today (they will probably be built into the wallets we have today after all).

Those improve under lightning network.


That *mostly* improves under lightning network (instant irreversible transactions etc..).
However, there is an edge case where a LN node can transmit old versions of other LN nodes transactions in an attempt to steal funds and if said node is permanently offline it could confirm.  The flip side to that is that if your node comes online (or has a trustless third-party monitoring for it) you get to keep all of the channels funds so the penitily for getting cought is quite steep.

Bitcoins are actually stored... nowhere.  They don't actually exist.
And I am not being facetious, there is no actual record of bitcoins anywhere on the blockchain, just outputs in the UTXO.  Having a private key allows you to sign those outputs allows you to create new outputs but yeah, that is not the same as storing them.
That covers technically and practically but IANAL so cannot really cover the legal aspects of it.

That point is subjective.  You may not wish to optimize everything, I don't always agree.

No, Lightning supplements bitcoin but it does not replace it.
There is no 'Lightning BTC' as a unit of account to buy, your buying bitcoin (it *could* be over lightning though).  When you have bitcoin on the lightning network you still have a private key and the right to spend it and a balance in a bitcoin address.

@_date: 2018-11-04 05:19:31


That is why I was uncertain.  All bitcoin is in the UTXO, whether it is in a channel or not.  The only bitcoin that is not in the UTXO is the bitcoin not mined yet (or mistakenly never mined).
Being in a channel or being in an exchange or being in your wallet, it is all in the UTXO.


In theory, it will be smaller on disk because many transactions can take place over LN without splitting the UTXO into smaller and smaller bits.  Only the summary of all the transactions gets into the UTXO as two outputs instead of each individual transaction ending up with two UTXO entries.


The two people involved in the channel do a quick (automated) negotiation.  Usually, the person that opened the channel will pay.
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:50:04


The facts are that UASF made the miners activate segwit.
In law we have something called the ["But for"]( rule that is used to determine causality.  It is useful when there is a lot of factors that lead to an event.
You go back through the factors and say (in your head) "But for *factor* the *event* would not have happened.  When you find one that has no "but for" you have found the root causality.
You can say:
* But for miner signalling, segwit would not have happened.
* But for NYA, miner signalling would not have happened.
* But for UASF, NYA would not have happened.
But there is no "but for" for UASF that lead to the event of segwit being activated.  You could say "But for BIP 141 segwit would not have been activated" but that bip did not activate segwit, it was about to time out.
In the end, but for UASF we would not have segwit.

Finally debating with actual facts.  I really appreciate it.
The NYA failed in its goals and more importantly, the NYA was a reaction to the UASF movement (with a few additions).  It is not a chicken and egg problem, even if you say that the NYA activated segwit it was the UASF that prompted the NYA.
The result is the same, the UASF succeeded in activating segwit.

Yeah, I know...


He is, but the problem was that he was talking about nodes and I was talking about wallets as in the title to the tread... misunderstandings stemmed from there to talking cross purpose about two things (my original point being that you don't have to keep your LN wallet keys online 24/7), shit happens.
The bizarre thing is after I worked it out and pointed the misunderstanding out to him he totally denies that wallets even exist in LN despite me linking a few of them, hence the comment :P .

As says if you transmit another transaction using the same funds but include a higher fee there is a non-trivial chance that the miners will include the transaction with the higher fee in it instead of the original transaction.

Unfortunately, there is so much FUD and misinformation about LN it is hard to get real honest answers these days.
Certain members of the community are trying to promote LN as some sort of banking takeover that will replace normal bitcoin transactions because it suits there agenda but the reality is that it is just an extension with a specific purpose.
For normal people with a LN wallet they lifecycle will look like:
* Open Channel
* Spend Channel
* Close Channel
It was never meant to replace receiving funds for normal users, it is just meant to make paying someone instant &amp; secure because 0-conf is fundamentally broken and always has been.
**EDIT:** [On queue some of that misinformation and fud appairs.](  A regular deliberately misquotes what I said in order to promote FUD and misinformation.  Yet another example of their dishonesty.

That's right, it is used in negligence cases as well to determine the root cause.  Anywhere you have a series of events where you want to find the root cause is a candidate for "but for".

I find the hysteria surrounding fungibility a bit over blown to be honest.  Sure if you steal a pile of coins and transfer them directly to an exchange you are going to have problems but just normal proper coin management is enough to throw enough doubt on the source of the coins thet you would never be able to prove anything in court.
I always think back to the 20,000 BTC pizzas, right now your coins (and mine) are probably tainted with that transaction but I sure as hell didn't eat any of that pizza (you may have, but I could not prove it).

Right now they are, we aren't even out of beta yet.




Sort of, a wallet will only need to be online when it sends funds as well as opening and closing funds.
Think about it, how would you even have a LN node on a mobile device.  It needs a static IP, it needs forground processing, it needs a pile of things you could not do on a phone.
However, if you just wanted to open channels, send funds and close channels all you need is a small subset of LN functions that you can do in a traditional wallet.

The risks are you are keeping bitcoin online in a hot wallet.  Every service that interacts with bitcoin does this so it is not entirely unique but it is a bit troublesome, especially for the tech novice (and even a lot of experts).
The rewards is the fees that you will collect for routing payments.  Noone really knows what that will be yet.

That is the narrative that is being pushed by that sub yes.  Reality is somewhat different though.
Over here people realize that zero confirmation transactions aren't safe so unless you do something else any business who accepts them is going to be losing money.  It is just not a suitable use case for bitcoin directly.
The other sub will tell you something different but they are just plain wrong.
Transactions that can wait for a confirmation on the other had are a perfect use case for bitcoin and one of the main purpose of the recent upgrade (segwit) is to make it easier and cheaper to do those types of transactions.  So, no I am not kidding.

That's how LN wallets work.
Every now and then you load up a channel with funds using a (probably random) node.  You then spend that channel until either the funds are gone or the channel expires (and you get the remainder of your funds back).  You only have to bring your wallet online once during your channel nLockTime period to either refresh, close or force close your channel (having said that, there are plans for third-party trustless service to do that for you).

It is what the regular uses use.  Their wallet opens a channel with a node and uses it to route payments, here is one:
Sooner or later most wallets will have LN built in.  They don't have to be online 24/7 only every now and then to make sure that the node is not going to rip them off (and even then.. they can just get someone else to do it for them).
When the channel was opened a transaction was generated and signed at that time so the wallet can close the channel without access to the keys if the other person is up to no good.
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:40:53

No illusion. It was actual consensus.


It isn't clean unfortunately.  There was quite a large chance that the network would split and a host of other things could have gone wrong.
It was a f*ing unfortunate position to be in but the miners decided to hold segwit to ransom for their own reasons (you can decide on what they were).  In the end, it took the users to step in and remind the miners that it is us (uses like you and me) that give bitcoin value.  We can also take it away from them.
It shoudl not have come to that, but it was the miners who brought us there.

@_date: 2018-11-04 05:33:31
Actually, someone else said that... but it is (mostly) right.  It is a user pays type system, if you want to open a channel, you are generally the one who pays for the expenses.
It is the way that bitcoin transactions have worked from the beginning so it is not all that unusual, the person doing the thing pays the fees.

It was coercion as well, and yeah, it should not have had to happen.
The shitty part of history is actually the miners trying to tell you and I what we can and cannot do though.  If they had not done that (for whatever reason) it would not have happened.  The real downside to that is that the miners have gone from equals in the blockchain to servants.  We are not going to ask them to do things anymore, we are going to tell them.

That is actually an easy one, no they don't exist.
One of the funny misconceptions that comes out of calling bitcoin bitcoin is that there is an association with a coin.  Wile they are of course digital you can still imagine such a coin existing (digitally), only, they don't.
There is no record of coins in the blockchain existing at all, just a series of inputs and outputs.  So when an address actually has coins in it they don't actually exist, they are just an input that was cryptographically signed.

And the only reason I say C does it better is that I have never seen anyone make Rust perform like C.  I suspect if you hand optimize everything you could get it close but as I say, you would be bypassing all of the really good stuff in Rust to do it and it would be very odd looking (unmaintainable) rust code.  May as well do it in C if performance was a key factor.

Actually, there is.
They make out as if they are the only ones that want bitcoin to be a currency setting up a strawman argument that the other side does not.  The reality is that both sides want bitcoin as a currency but that does not fit with their propaganda.

I expect addresses to largely disappear into the background some time soonish so I don't see it being a problem for much longer.

That is fine, they don't need to support segwit to be able to send to a segwit address.

I really don't get your answer, you told him he couldn't send to his segwit address because of something that he did not say he was going to do (and does not stop him anyway, it is just not a good idea).
There is a leap of logic in your answer that I don't think should be present.

Please don't go back on your word.


Nice of you to spend their money BUT there is an alternative that will give 100% confidence instantly.  A merchant selling coffee would have to be insane not to use it.
I don't actually accept your like of 'logic' either.  Double spending is trivial to do, if we ever get to the sage that everyone buys there coffee in the morning with bitcoin there will be thousands of 'double spend services' out there with millions of users.
You think waiting for a confirmation is a bad experience, how do you think that experience will be for merchants?

Yeah... over the counter payments like that have always been a bit of an issue.  People have tried to tackle it in several different ways, usually off chain.

No I told you you were having a different conversation than I was.
Not being able to separate ideas is endemic levels in bitcoin and particularly in .  Try it for yourself, go over there and say you like something positive about a neutral technology (segwit for example) you will get a pile of people telling you about how AXA is trying to take over bitcoin.  It is retarded.


@_date: 2017-10-06 20:58:13


I don't actually think he is.  You are describing a few more steps that will make it work, a lot of people would not have thought to do that because they were unaware of the issue in the first place.
Some wallets don't even allow the steps you are describing.

And I keep coming back to, this is what I claim:
* The UASF had one goal and one goal only, activate segwit on August 1st, 2017.
* Segwit activated on August 1st, 2017.
What part do you want me to substantiate?  Is either of those statements wrong?
It had a goal, the goal was achieved.  It succeeded.  It is fine if you disagree, but show me some evidence that it did not succeed instead of asking me to repeat the same facts (again).

@_date: 2017-09-25 01:01:03
First let's go into censorable money.
Censorable money is things like credit cards, paypal, banks etc.  If the governing body of one of those outfits decide that you cannot transact with an individual, or an individual cannot transact with you or even that the individual or you cannot transact at all there is nothing you can do about it.  You transactions are censored and that is the end of the story.
Now censorship resistant money.
Censorship resistant money is permissionless, i.e. no one can stop you opening an account or transacting with whomever you please.  There is no governing body that can decide that someone cannot transact or hold a balance.
So, why do we call it censorship resistance instead of censorship free?
The entry/exit points of bitcoin are through a censorable gateway (i.e. credit cards, paypal, banks etc) so that can be a hurdle.  Additionally if someone gets together enough hashpower (i.e. a 51% attack) they can effectively censor your transactions IF they somehow know your address.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:19:18

No, unfortunately, other projects suck my time up.  I do run a node though for the hell of it and to keep abreast of how it is shaping up.


Right now you do, that will probably change though.  There is even a DNS SRV protocol for node discovery:


Channel announcements, incoming invoices, invoice requests, route requests, routing others payments.  Most mobile platforms have very limited resources for background processes.


I did not mean doing it all in one go.  I meant like:  Open a channel Monday, spend on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday and possibly close on Sunday (closing is not necessary, but you could do it).


Nodes will always be one half of the system (at least).


It is a payment channel, it is trustless.

Without seeing the transaction it is hard to tell what happened there. 
It does seem a lot, where there lots of inputs?
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:04:56
Sure, it is quite simple.
The UASF said that any blocks that did not signal segwit past that date would be forked off the network.
Miners had a choice, either signal and get the block reward or... get nothing.
On that date, the miners did the smart thing and capitulated.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:53:29


Arguing in its classic form, i.e. to make an argument for something.
I am arguing it is best to dump early as possible, you are arguing that there is no replay protection.
My argument does not alter if there is replay protection or not, I am just saying that it is best to do it early.  I do agree that replay protection is going to make it hard on users to do, but that is beside the point.
@_date: 2018-03-04 23:02:56

No, you probably won't interact with the recipient directly at all.  They (like you) will have one channel open to any point of the network and you will route payments through the network.


There are no central entities in LN so I will just end that one there.
While you are right, LN is not the be all and end off of all bitcoin issues (we still need to increase the block size after all) it does not seem like you have a good enough grip on what it is and what it does in order to judge.

LN while being billed as a fast, cheap and safe way to transact is so much more than that.  It gives us the building blocks to do stuff that is going to totally revolutionise the way we use bitcoin and blockchains.
Private, true smart contracts allowing things like atomic chain swaps is just the beginning.

Very excellent question.
Consensus in computing (like we are using it) is not the same thing as consensus in people, here is some more reading for when you are bored:
Consensus is always 100% in bitcoin, either it is bitcoin or it isn't and it is determined &amp; enforced by the software we run.
Changing bitcoin consensus is deliberately hard, you need nearly 100% "people consensus" to change the "computer consensus".  If there are arguments or agreement cannot be come to the "computer consensus" remains the same (even though the people consensus is divided).  Why it is so hard is to make it resistant to small or large organisations to come along a dictate consensus to ust (i.e. governments).
I sometimes wish we did not call consensus consensus ;) .  Rules would be a better word.

No, a hot wallet is online 24/7 ready and able to sign transactions.
A LN wallet would be like a SPV wallet (bread wallet, electrum etc..) you only bring it online to make a transaction and even then, you probably should use a hardware wallet to sign it.

The misinformation in this thread is staggering.
It seems that is just making people stupider by existing.
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:03:05


That is probably the issue.  The fees are determined by the size of the transaction and each of those inputs needs to be recorded and signed and those signatures are what makes up most of the transaction.
Again though, without looking at the transaction I cannot tell you much more but I have used electrum on and off over the years and I have never had it charge fees that have been what I would consider excessive for a transaction.

Yeah, nodes are the things that enforce the consensus.  They have the 'consensus rules' built into them and reject things that break those rules.
That is why miners cannot do things like steal your coins or give themselves more rewards than they are due.  Nodes like yours reject it.


Well, if there are not enough nodes to enforce those rules miners can start to dictate to us what those rules are.

Just so you know what would happen, if you sent an email without the dot (like dsmreg it would be treated as a relative address and not anchored to the DNS root.
So, if you were on a domain called bob.com. instead of going to the intended recipient it would go to dsmreg
Your SMTP server would then say na uh and bounce it back to you.
Interestingly enough, while most software hides the dot root from you these days relative addressing (without the dot) is still widely used and you have probably even used it without knowing.  If you have ever pinged another server on your network or opened a windows share by just typing its name in the resolver is appending the rest of your domain name in.

@_date: 2017-10-24 04:18:17
Let's break this down:
1.  If I send BTC from my paper wallet and use my private key, won't everyone know my Private Key?
No, you use the private key to sign the transaction, you don't broadcast it to the network.
2.  If so, do I have to transfer the remaining balance to a new paper wallet every time? 
Having said 1. above every time you transfer bitcoin out of an address you do so in its entirety. You can transfer bitcoins you don't want to spend back to the same address.  While you can do that, it's not recommended for privacy reasons (and a slight decrease in security).
3. Can't be right.

@_date: 2017-10-04 06:19:17
Entirely possible to make a transaction like that, you may have problems getting it relayed depending of the policies set in various clients but as long as there is a fee I am sure someone will mine it for you (miners often use their own software with their own selection criteria).
In practice though you will probably have an easier time transferring a tiny amount though but because the above code does not specify it I thought I should make it clear as a possibility.

Direct with nothing in between?  I doubt it.  That 133 MB is also considering current methodologies, something like schnorr could reduce that by 20-25% .  


I don't see why it would.  Instant transactions and microtransactions cannot be done safely on the main chain.

@_date: 2018-07-06 20:48:54
I think the problem here is that you may have been misled about block size.  If you read some parts of the internet you may get the impression that we are going to stick with the 1 MB limit in perpetuity.
This is not the case.
If you read the LN whitepaper they even mention as part of the scaling plan increasing the block size.  The example they give in the summery is even a 133 MB block when we have ~ 7 billion users.

You have seen how carry on right?  Personal attacks, conspiricy theories, ad hominems etc.
was flooded with them after a minor disagreement about how to increase the block size, one guy said "we should put it up to 20MB immediately" and the other side said, "woah, let's think about this first".
Some other guy released a modified bitcoin client that broke consensus and a shitstorm started (Personal attacks, conspiricy theories, ad hominems etc.) instead of discussing it rationally.
Theymos clamped the sub down and said anything that does not follow consensus is not bitcoin and is an altcoin and therefore belongs elsewhere.

You are never going to know, it is impossible to tell what an arbitrary transaction was for. 
On top of that, a lot of transactions take place off chain.  In addition, as layer 2 becomes more popular is going to make it impossible to know that transactions have even taken place.

I am glad that people forked off and make their own altcoin to better suit what they thought the solution was.  We can now compare directly between the two.

That is different.
I totally agree any service with a hot wallet that you run is at risk.  Exchanges, mixers, anything and that includes a lighting node.  Since the post was about wallets though I did not follow your leap and was still talking about LN wallets.
It has to be noted though, most users won't be doing that and those that are know the risks.
@_date: 2017-10-04 08:42:45


Your wallet needs to support it, it is called a sendmeny, here are the doc's:
Basicly it is 1 transaction with 1 or more inputs and more than one output.  Exchanges do it a lot so you have probably seen it before.
Electrum and Bitcoin-QT support it and other probably do too (I have no idea though).
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:31:16


It is selection bias and we all suffer from it to one degree or another (I know I certainly do and anyone who is honest with themselves would too).


I don't have the numbers either but the Chinese exchanges did 3-5 times as much volume that all of the other exchanges in the world put together.

While economic stability is also desirable my feelings is that we are years (or decades) away from it.

We just need to make sure that we don't let short turn conveniences eff the entire thing up.

It never actually leaves.  Your wallet is not showing it because it does not think it is spendable at the moment.  After some time the transaction just dropps off the bitcoin network and you can spend it again.

I would do it before, if you try to do it afterwards but you could end up sending on both chains.
You can do it now if you like, send some small amount to the exchange, wait until after the split, and then use the relative coins afterwards to send back to your wallet.
Just a word of warning though, make sure when they are back into your wallet send your entire wallet balance to make sure your include the tainted coins.

My recommendation would be pycoin:
I have used it in several projects over the years, he even has a code block to do exactly that in the README:
    from pycoin.symbols.btc import network
    key = network.keys.private(secret_exponent=1)  # this is a terrible key because it's very guessable
    print(key.wif())
    print(key.sec())
    print(key.address())
    print(key.address(is_compressed=False))
    same_key = network.parse.private(key.wif())
    print(same_key.address())
It also has really good BIP32 support etc.

* 2^63 or 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 grains of sand on earth.

That link outlines the risks.  It does not say it will never happen.


It is the opposite, we need bitcoin to be as sturdy as possible to build things on.  There is no point building a 100 story condo with all the mod cons if you don't get the foundations right.
You may not like the idea of this but if economic and technical motivations contradict each other the technical considerations will always win out in bitcoin.  It is pointless to build a trillion dollar industry on something that is not built to support it.

Not while a 51% attack is ongoing.
Because the attacker has a majority of hashpower he can build his on 'attack' chain faster than the rest of the miners on the network.  So, even if the other miners do find a block with the transaction in it the attacker can make his chain faster without the transaction in it.
This all, of course, depends on him maintaining 51% or more.

You could double spend before, and you can still double spend.  The pub owner might get a bit more warning if you set the RBF bit but it really does not change that use case.

You cannot do that forever, before long you start to run into bottlenecks that start to centralise things.
Take those 7 billion transactions a day, that is 1.75 petabytes that needs to be transmitted to the thousands of nodes out there.  It would break the internet (let alone bitcoin)

It is mentioned all the way through but just skip to the conclusion for the conclusion:
@_date: 2015-11-30 01:38:12
I don't know if people are doing it deliberately or not but most of the anti-arguments seem to hinge around three things.
1. 0-conf is reliable and in use.
2. RBF is compulsory.
3. RBF is hard to detect compared to double spends.
None of it is true.  It is so obvious to me I cannot understand why people think things like that.
I cannot say I am the greatest fan of RBF but it changes nothing for me or the vast majority of users.... I cannot understand the fuss.
@_date: 2015-11-29 04:35:36


Totally agreed, you can't.   RBF does not make 0-conf transactions unsafe, they always were.
@_date: 2015-11-29 03:45:05


Sure, a RBF transaction is flagged as such and cannot be hidden, it can be dealt with accordingly.
A 'normal' double spend will look like a normal transaction until it is actually double spent.

Transaction sequence and lock times.
Whoever has the later transaction signend by both parties wins.
@_date: 2018-04-08 00:13:59
Yeah.... with selfish mining someone with less than 51% of the network could also potentially create double spends.
There is a different mechanism to it, but it could definitely be done.  It is not 100% like with a 51% attack but it definitely increases your chances above the chance you have to double-spend something without a 0-conf transaction.
@_date: 2017-05-28 19:19:20


It is fairly simple, I will just take a few things to show you how it works.
Roads:  My annual tax contribution would pay for less than 30 meters of new roads and far less than 100 meters of road maintenance.
And yet I have many hundreds of thousands of kilometers to drive on.
Security: My taxes wouldn't even pay for a single person part time to protect me.
And yet I have hundred thousands of people employed in full time work is to do so.
That is just a few examples of many (health, education etc not even mentioned).  I could not pay for all of the benefits I get from my taxes.  Most civilized countries are that way.
I do feel for people like you who live in shit holes like Somalia though and get nothing back for their taxes (and get forced to pay them at gunpoint) but as I said, perhaps you should look at immigrating.

@_date: 2015-11-29 04:33:28
That isn't true.
it may look like that but they don't send out the payment accepted until there are confirmations.
Bitpay does let you do 0-conf but it tells you upfront that it is unsafe and RBF does not change that, it just tells the vendor that you might.
@_date: 2015-11-29 03:31:27
So people have to accept that if they do 0-conf there is a risk?
Apart from making it easier to detect does RBF change this?

I get that from paying my taxes.  Furthermore, since everyone in my country is paying into the same pot is is far cheaper than if we were paying into 1,000 different pots.  That is not a guess by the way, I looked up how much it costs for health insurance in the US and it is around about the same as I pay in tax total not including all of the other benefits I get.


I see what your are suggesting is inefficient and expensive yes.


Is this one private contractor that does all of the roads (i.e. a monopoly so they can rape me for cost) or will there be 5 different roads that I can take from my house to work and chose from the competition?
One way I get raped by a monopoly, the other is so ludicrously inefficient the public end up paying for 5 roads.

Basically yes, it allows them to broadcast a transaction that may appear to confirm in blocks (by other miners) but then not include them in their 51% chain that will sooner or later exclude the transaction.

Made up statistic.
But what you seem to be getting at is that 0-conf is not safe regardless of RBF or not.  I have to agree.
It has a few limited use cases IMO (respending things to increase fees to get confirmed) but I cannot understand all the outrage.  0-conf was never safe, RBF does not change that.

No, in order to RBF one transaction by another the first one **MUST** have the RBF bit set.  You cannot RBF transactions without the bit set.
If you could just replace any transaction by setting the RBF bit on another one that would be pointless.  We may as well have full RBF.

@_date: 2018-04-17 23:14:42


As each LN transaction takes place both parties must agree to sign the transaction and agree on the order of the transaction and that is held for the final settlement.


You can certainly try to submit an older transaction to the blockchain as a settlement (that is what this thread is about) but you would have already signed a newer transaction with a later sequence and lock time.
If the counterparty sees your older transaction hit the blockchain that is when they can take your funds for stealing.

**You're a hypocrite.**


@_date: 2015-11-29 06:04:59


Yep.  It is totally optional and transactions will be like they are now by default.
The use case is that if you were making a payment you could include no or low fees.  If it does not confirm you can go back and add some, then add some more etc until it confirms.


Developers work on what they want to.  This has been Peter's baby for quite some time now and he has constantly been knocked back by just about everyone.  He eventually tried it as an optional flag (what we are seeing now) and because it does not change anything unless the user explicitly says so and the other party is immediately aware that the RBF flag has been set it got through.
It does not actually change how bitcoin itself works so it is not a consensus charge.  I am like you and think it a bit pointless but since it does not actually change anything and I am not forced to use it it am not worried about it.
On the other hand, if it was compulsory I would be up in arms like the rest of you.

In reality, it is the other way around.
Even if segwit is activated you can chose not to use it and that is fine, no one is going to force you, not me, not segwit or even bitcoin itself.  It is entirely up to you.
However, if you increase the block size not only are you forcing everyone to update, your forcing nodes to store more, consume more bandwidth and increase their networks latency (not to mention the cpu increase).  When you start to talk about people wanting to join the network 10 years from now you may have just made it impossible.
So, having said that, does it change your mind as to who is forcing what?

Fraud proofs are required in order to do exactly what is in the whitepaper and we are chipping our way towards them at the moment.  A few things need to be done first but we are getting there.
My personal opinion is that SPV is usable as it is.  I would hesitate to keep all of my bitcoin in one but for day to day usage I am fine with it.  I wont be using it though when there is a fork or anything going on though because SPV cannot detect things like that (yet).
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:02:08


In that case you don't actually have any bitcoin.
First thing to do, is grab your phone, make sure it isn't riddled with malware, create a wallet, write down your recover seed and then withdraw to it.
**THEN** you actually have bitcoins, at that point start to think very seriously about getting a hardware wallet.

Not the same thing, segwit is optional and you can chose if you want to use it or not.  Extension blocks don't give you the choice, other people decide if your transaction and bitcoins are put into the extension.
@_date: 2017-07-17 06:34:21
You know... I have no idea :P .
It is one of those things that everyone in bitcoin development knows about, knows how to fix it and knows we are working on so no one has really 'whitepapered' it.  (There are a few things in bitcoin like that).
I did a google and found this:
It is a fairly good summary of what the problem is.
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:52:05


Don't panic, just calmly look at the wallets available on the app store (breadwallet, mycelium or copay seem to be popular) and decide on the one that you like best and move to that (make sure you use pen and paper to write down the seed that they tell you to).  At that point they are yours and you can do some reading and decide where to go from there (if anywhere).


I actually know very little about their vault.  I do know that having anyone else involved in storing your coins is probably not going to end well.

To make it *seem* organic.  If they kept the percentage of introduced transactions low enough it would be impossible to prove that anything amiss is going on.  We would probably cotton on quickly, but because we cannot see a globalized mempool, we cannot prove it.
It will also fool all of the fee estimators.


Absolutely.  Or just cap the block size at 50% or some such.  That would be a lot more obvious though but in the end, it is the same effect.

Do you?  Collectively people have lost literately hundreds of millions of dollars so far not following it, a new batch has just learned the hard way a few days back (BTC-e).  After every time people come out and start giving the same advice again and the new set of users come out saying that they wished they had followed that advice.
If we are overdoing it now what figure do you think that is becomes 'just right', tens of billions, trillions perhaps?

@_date: 2019-05-02 22:42:13


What a weird assumption you make there.  Where on earth did you get that?
A much more sensible way would be to mine say ~25% of your own transactions to push up fees by ~50% (for example, if you were going to do this you would need to work out the point of equilibrium).

You could, segwit works this way for example.


It is not in its current form, in the current incarnation the miner gets to decide.
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:11:43


It is sort of like that.  Bitcoin history is full of those banks been emptied and the banks just vanishing overnight though.  It happened only yesterday after all (BTC-e).


That is where that seed comes in and the hardware wallet I mentioned.  In the end though, your bitcoin is your responsibility, you can give someone else the responsibility but you no longer have bitcoin, just an IOU.  As I have said above though, there are a lot of people out there with IOU's from places that have just vanished over night


Nothing that I know of sorry.
@_date: 2019-05-17 01:54:46
Let ME spell it out for you, little boy
Just because you want your transactions not to be seen as spam when you do that... the rest of the world does not have to agree with your opinion to appease you.
Bitcoin was built for peer to peer transactions, just because you don't want to use it as such, it does not mean everyone else has to bow to your will and call your transactions anything else but spam.
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:42:09


It depends, most people have windows.... so yeah, it is better off on you phone than on that.  This is only short turn until you work out how you are going to store them permanently.  You may end up sticking with the phone, but make sure the bitcoins are yours first.


Even with a hardware wallet you still have to have that bit of paper.
@_date: 2017-07-03 08:28:38

@_date: 2019-05-03 06:56:08


Yeah, I think that is probably the only way it could be executed undetected.  Funnily enough, the lack or orphan blocks these days (because of improvements ironically) makes this easier to execute.  Having said that, 1 or 2 percent makes a notable difference to miners bottom line these days.
I am not saying it is happening, or even likely.  But "Basic math. You cannot guarantee that you will find blocks and recover your transaction fees." is just wrong.

They are not using it to transfer value.  It is spam.
@_date: 2017-07-17 01:08:38
They seem to be mixed bunch on the topic.
The main issue is that we never got around to implementing full SPV (yet) and that has lead to privacy &amp; security concerns.  So, some won't touch it with a barge pole and others readily use it.  
The same goes for Core developers (the other group he decided to lump together to make his imaginary group) but it is much harder to tell, there are quite a few of those and there is no way to get a true consensus about that (hardly surprising since Core is not a SPV client).
@_date: 2019-05-04 22:24:09


There is, but the fed shut down production:

I don't get what you mean, they are getting paid.  I don't think anyone begrudges miners being paid.  It is just when they do underhanded stuff and try to dictate to everyone else what they can and cannot do that people start to get antsy about it.
Their job is quite clear, they are there to secure the network and they get paid for it.  It is not their job to tell everyone else what they can and cannot do.

I do it by measuring my net worth in Bitcoin.

Basic logic.   You can if you don't broadcast the transactions to the network.  that way the miner is the only one that can possibly mine the transaction.  Making the attack free.
@_date: 2019-05-02 23:29:04


Really, where did I say that you mine your own transactions and none others exclusively?
I think we have a miscommunication here.  Apologies.
Back to my point though.  This is false:


You can guarantee you mine the transactions and recover the fees.  You can use it to increase fees on the network creating more profits.  OP does have a legitimate point (though one we have known about for quite some time).

While I hesitate to talk for everyone...  "We" will increase the block size as needed providing "we" can do it safely.
The thing is, what would you say the most important feature of Bitcoin is?  Would it be low fees... or the fact that it is decentralized?
If you are like me (and a lot of other people) you would say that decentralization is the most important factor in bitcoin, and decentralization must be preserved at all costs.  Even now, with the block size as it is, people are having problems syncing up nodes and while that is improving on a software level, it is going backward on the share amount of data that needs to be processed and transmitted across the network.  Fewer nodes, less decentralization.
Hitting the proper balance is tricky, but when it comes down to it, decentralization is the foremost factor to keep in mind.

The US is so far in debt to all those other countries a globally aggressive move like attempting to enforce their laws globally would bankrupt the US.  Debts would be called in, the reserve currency would change and the US would find themselves paupers.

Let say move evil megacorp (** cough ** paypal ** cough **) start to get hurt by Bitcoin.  Let's say it is costing them a few billion dollars in revenue a year.
So, the evil megacorp could decide to spend a few hundred million a year to 'scale automatically' bitcoin past a point where it is sustainable as a decentralized network.  Sucks for us, but that can do that anonymously.
