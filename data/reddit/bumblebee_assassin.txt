yup that's when you revert to silver coins, beans, bullets, and band-aids for currency IF you survive.  If that were to be the case then Bitcoin going to zero would be the least of a person's problems

What is your blood pressure like watching these swings?  Seriously!  You mentioned the Sunday futures markets, is this every Sunday?  Or is this a special Sunday coming up?

If memory serves (and I have zero experience to be certain) I seem to recall some stuff on running your business and its basically along the lines of "own nothing, control everything".  What that means is that the business owns everything, but you own the business and therefore control all the holdings, you still own everything but the business takes legal responsibilities.  The basic principle is that if the business goes tits up or there are legal problems, bankruptcy, taxing problems, etc, etc, etc then it is now on the business and not on you personally.  Find a CPA they would be able to help better
@_date: 2019-08-14 20:35:19

Want to know why he hates bitcoin?  Follow the money!  Just how many banks and investment firms is he deep in that are direct odds with Bitcoin?
This is EXACTLY like how he opposed the keystone pipeline that was supposed to go from Canada down through the Dakotas, etc.  IF the keystone pipeline would have happened then all his deals for transporting oil via Union Pacific would have been worthless!
FOLLOW THE MONEY
Then realize he's terrified for his rat friends in the banking industry

Long and short of it is he's buddy buddy with Buffet and thinks the same and has a lot of similar investments (ie banks)
Also, last summer he also said that he did own BTC when someone gave him some but sold it right away, he owns none currently

My short position could only hope for such a thing
@_date: 2019-04-25 21:32:54
pretty common practice from what I understand as well for avoiding taxes as you're using it to make a purchase instead of selling for other coins.  One of those gray areas of the cryptomarkets. Again this is from my understanding though which in this case is admittedly limited.

False, unless you're using a gpu from 5 years ago.  Head here for a quick idea on profitability between power/gpu.  Granted its not going to be 100% accurate and there are ways to increase profits but it gives you a rough idea on things.  Also this isn't exactly the sub for that kind of talk, so I won't go too deep here.

If I recall correctly a news station tracked down a person by the name of Satoshi Nakamodo, but when they interviewed him they found out he was a total techo-noob and had never even heard about Bitcoin.  If memory serves correctly he lived in the same neighborhood as Hal, and has been theorized that Hal took the name for his own anonymity.  Considering he was in on one of the first transactions for Bitcoin it would stand to reason at least.
If any of this is wrong please correct me

I have been thinking about them for sure.  Been thinking about them fort he last several months.  Been waiting for the dip for the n00b miners to sell their gear at rock bottom prices.  I've been watching, I've been waiting, and now in about a month should be able to strike at this PERFECT storm for someone wanting to get into mining this year.
I could be wrong, but then again I couldn't be anymore wrong than my trading strategies so far ;)

The cognitive dissonance in /BTC in the comments on the same link caused my brain to implode.

no, the most secure device I own is my wallets within multiple VM's on external hard drives, that do not get plugged in and do not connect to the internet unless I want to sync them up.
Or are you really saying that a device that can easily be hacked by a malicious ad, that inserts malware on your phone that is ALWAYS connected to the internet and has an unknown amount of vulnerabilities that have yet to be discovered and patched (Droid), without even taking into consideration manufacturer backdoors (Huawei specifically right now) or can be nuked because you dared change a cracked screen (Apple) or any number of things I haven't even listed much less buggy /malicious apps, etc.
Now.... about that bridge.... I can go as low as 1.5 BTC if you like

and what happens when a malicious app puts a backdoor and a keylogger on your phone?  The $5 wrench attack is quite easy to pull off too, its where I beat you witha  $5 wrench until you give me your passcode.  Just how long are you going to hold out under that hmm?

Didn't Andreas Antonopoulos mention in one of his interviews that the Bitcoin price spiked when Greece's economy tanked?  Could be remembering wrong but I could have sworn he used this as an example of how crypto is a safe haven in case of recession, I remain hopeful.
@_date: 2019-05-14 13:33:38


Precisely, as I said elsewhere, follow the money he already has invested.  Just like the Keystone Pipeline was at odds with his Union Pacific holdings transporting the same oil (which he fought tooth and nail and incidentally won with the same FUD tactics) , Bitcoin, etc are at odds with his current holdings so he will automatically be opposed to it and fight it by default with the same tactics.  He's just not used to losing is all.
@_date: 2018-12-28 16:41:18


Yes but the risk is mitigated to extreme levels as I am not carrying around my drives and they never leave their secure location.  With my phone I am.  Please don't get me wrong, I do use BRD wallet on my phone, BUT the amount maintained there is extremely minimal.... like sub $100 worth of BTC so I can have it on hand in case I find some place that accepts it for payment.

You mean like he wasn't also fighting against the Keystone Pipeline because it would have stripped him of his profits from Union Pacific shipping the same oil over the railways?
