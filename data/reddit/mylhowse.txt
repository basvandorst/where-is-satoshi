Is the 0.1 bitcoin payment locked in? If so, definitely bitcoin. If the payments are adjusted to be equal each paycheck, then I'd take fiat until more places accept bitcoin.

It's kind of lame, too. You can buy &amp; sell on the Robinhood app, but you can't transfer the coins to your own wallet. Robinhood performs the trades on external exchanges and tacks on a margin. 
I hope this isn't their long-term plan...

FYI it's fixed now.

Just a guess, so bear with me.
Earlier this year it looks like EVERY twitter password was being stored in plain-text: 
Although no breach was reported, it's still possible that these password got into the wrong hands. If your reddit and twitter handle are different, then providing a scammer with a way to link these addresses could help them guess username/password combos for crypto related sites.
Let's say that you use the same password for every site, but your twitter username is different from your other usernames. Once a scammer knows ALL of your usernames, they can try out your twitter password with all known usernames for crypto related sites (binance, coinbase, etc.) in an attempt to steal your coins.
However, the part about wanting your twitter link directly is even more suspicous. I don't personally have a twitter account, but maybe twitter stores personal user information in the URL that a scammer can use? It's especially fishy that he wants a link instead of your username...
