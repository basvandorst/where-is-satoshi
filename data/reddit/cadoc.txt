Can the smart contract reposses my house if I stop paying my mortgage?
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:58:55
If they're going to keep my money for me and give me loans, wouldn't they just basically *be* banks? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:17:08
So every time someone stops paying their mortgage, the person behind the smart contract would need to sue to lender to enforce the contract. That seems extremely unsustainable.

How is Bitcoin going to replace the banks when I need a mortage for my house?

The price of the altcoins is overwhelmingly dependent on the price of bitcoin, though. Bitcoin crashes -&gt; altcoins crash -&gt; cheap GPUs.
Though the GPU situation has gotten better, at least.

Who wouldn't go all wide-eyed watching the amazing rally that followed the Microsoft announcement?

Now play the americanpegasus game - is he literally insane, or is he vainly attempting to drum up enthusiasm as part of some inane pump and dump scheme? Maybe both?

Don't do it man. I'm sure you'll make them super sad. Can you live with that knowledge?

Can you blame people for being cautious, in the light of the countless scams and failed businesses around Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-01-23 13:41:40
It's amazing that this is what passes for "both sides of the coin" in this subreddit.
@_date: 2015-01-21 11:54:32
Sure, but as you can't use bitcoin as your sole currency, and you likely wouldn't even want to do it due to its insane volatility, fiat/bitcoin conversions are hugely important.
@_date: 2015-01-01 14:46:56
Pretty good, but you need to involve the international jewry in your theory to be taken seriously.
@_date: 2015-01-22 15:17:26


Depends on how you define "volatile". The change in the value of most major currencies is lesser *per annum* than what bitcoin regularly experiences in a single day. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 11:47:13
It's almost as if economic history has time and time again shown that deflation in a currency is bad for everyone but the richest few. I suspect that the ECB might intend for people to actually *use* the Euro, rather than hoard it for the purposes for speculation.
Fools, all of them!

Are you saying they haven't? I've seen predictions (far from few, in fact), back in 2013, that bitcoin will reach $10k+ per coin in 2014, just because the price increased a lot that year.

This subreddit needs some sort of "most euphoric comment of the week" award.

Kinda looks like bitcoin is helping your buddy sell cheap cigarettes from abroad, avoiding paying duty.
@_date: 2015-01-19 21:12:24
Even if credit cards are, by their nature, less secure than bitcoin, in practice they are *more* secure for the average customer. The level of security you have too constantly and consistently maintain to keep your bitcoins secure is high. If you fuck up once, that's it, your funds are gone. You can disregard even the most basic security when using your bank card, and you'll be fine, because if you fall victim to fraud your bank will compensate you.
@_date: 2015-01-22 12:26:57
They don't! People don't want to store their value in an inflationary currency! That's the *entire point*.
Look, if I could keep my money and have it grow a few % every year, why the hell would I ever actually *invest* it? Most investments return a very modest yield each year, and none are risk free. In this way, using a deflationary currency instantly kills a lot of the investment drive in a society.
There are more issues with it, but this is IMO the most important one.

Comparing the two subreddits, even if we diregard the total number of subscribers (which can be deceiving), has 102 shills operating right now, while there are 1,164 captains of industry currently in @_date: 2016-01-15 11:17:17
The actual state of the bitcoin network is the simplest argument against the existence of "paid trolls" opposed to BTC. It has been shown that you can grind the network to a halt for much less than it would take to employ several people to spread FUD online, so why would those imaginary enemies not do that instead? 
@_date: 2016-01-15 11:18:20
Oh you sweet summer child.

Via an exit scam.

You think so? Bitcoin is hardly used, and it uses more energy than Ireland. Banks handle hundreds or thousands times more transactions, if they were less efficient than Bitcoin they would probably account for all the global emissions.

How is the moderator supposed to determine whether a good was delivered or not? Also, how is a moderator chosen on an open, peer-to-peer network like OB?
@_date: 2016-02-13 13:29:10


That seems terribly complicated, especially considering both buyer and seller have to agree on a moderator.


Vendor provides a tracking number/proof of shipping. Seller claims that instead of a laptop, they were shipped a couple of bricks duct-taped together. How does the moderator solve that dispute?
@_date: 2016-02-13 00:09:07
How is the seller protected in that case?
@_date: 2016-02-24 00:57:36
Credit card fraud.
@_date: 2016-02-13 15:29:02
Exclusion from a centralised marketplace and refunds are tools available on Amazon or Ebay. OB is certain not to have the latter, and is extremely unlikely to have the former.
@_date: 2015-04-01 22:24:03
You wouldn't be able to actually USE bitcoin, because of the transactions per second limit.

Oh dude, you really think he's using even 1% of the money that was donated on this? That's a little sad.

Congratulations, you ascended to a level where it's literally impossible to tell if you're a fellow troll or the most euphoric (and historically ignorant) redditor ever.
