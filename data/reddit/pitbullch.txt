Since it only mentions Bitcoin, you might switch to purchasing BCH, ETH or LTC as your crypto entry currency instead ;-)

Oh ffs :-(

Click bait - universally despised by all right-thinking persons. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 19:00:22
Usual 1:1 IIRC.

Store of speculative value only now - not a useful currency.

UBS, Credit Suisse in Switzerland both fine so far.

Nat West, Nationwide BSoc both work fine.

All piss and wind: you know you’ll still buy your next game there, just with fiat not crypto.

Yes - but you need “guaranteed” stop losses to ensure a sell at the stated stop price - otherwise in a fast market you can be stopped out below - even well below - your stop loss price and get wiped out - as happened to a few people on Bitfinex a couple of weeks ago and they are still whining about it even though (a) margin trading is very risky and (b) margin trading of low volume shitcoins is like playing Russian roulette with 5 bullets and 1 empty chamber.

You had better run...

Do try to read the book - way better than the film as they left out so much.

...and there goes my coffee and keyboard - thanks for that !

Even though I like Bitcoin Cash, that’s quite funny.

Different subject, but same knuckle-headed attituded as Nazis and the KKK.

It goes unavailable half the time (especially during times of high volume) and throws up CloudFlare errors - if you do get in there’s a good chance you will be dumped out shortly after and need to login again. 
It basically is no longer reliable when you need it - a fatal flaw for such a platform. They either need to scale up or get out.

The irony passed you by then ;-)

TA was always bollocks when used against real-world stocks/shares - even more of a joke against crypto with the massive volatility it has. 
Always reminds me of horoscopes- spout enough random crap about neptune up uranus and it will partially apply to somebody somewhere.

At least one Swiss Kanton (probably Zug) partially accepts BTC for Kantonal tax payments - though IiRC it's capped quite low.

But the salaries are generally well in excess of elsewhere, taxes are very low and these two in most cases combine to more than nullify the relatively high living costs. 
Then we can talk about beautiful scenary, excellent transport, the mountains, cheese, low crime rate, fondue, excellent healthcare, chocolate, wine, free schooling and universities etc. 
So yeah - good place to live :-)

Coinfloor takes GBP fiat for BTC and (IIRC) ETH.

Always been the way - if you buy foreign fiat via a bank on MoneyLex or whatever, you can be sure you are paying either a direct fee, or an indirect fee via an exaggerated spread - or both.
