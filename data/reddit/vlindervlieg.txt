Yeah, I want to be hopeful, but I've seen so many powerful men (and women) in my lifetime who seemed to have good intentions when they started out, only to become corrupted and greedy from power over time...

Aaah, okay, it wasn't so obvious to me, some people are crazy to enough...

Hm, just a lot of unfounded claims, we'll have to wait and see what happens 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:47:59
Why not?

I think that the odds are way better than at the lottery, otherwise no rational human being would invest at all in stocks. But you're absolutely right that this is not a safe or reasonable way to save for retirement, it's more like gambling, but with much better odds. That's my thinking about hodling bitcoin. I don't see it as a real investment, but I enjoy the universe around it where you can learn a lot about current technological trends and also you can make bets on the future development of certain software projects aka cryptocurrencies.

If he practices what he preaches, he probably kept more than just 4 bitcoin in total.

Saudi-Arabian crown prince started a war on corruption recently. Not sure if his actual goal is to get rid of a few influential people who were standing in his way.

I like the idea of effective altruism, but I think the goal of "saving as many lives as possible" is very arbitrary and in some ways shortsighted and counterproductive. We don't need more human life on Earth, but less in absolute numbers, and more in terms of a higher average quality of life. So, I would say that the best charities are those who help people to have smaller families and healthier, safer lives, in a healthy, protected environment. Saving a child from Malaria is useless if that child doesn't get any education, and later starves because of a drought that is due to climate change and bad planning by a corrupt government.

SEPA means Single European Payment Area. Is Canada part of it? Or how is he supposed to use it? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:16:32
seriously? What a waste... considering that they would have been rich now if they had kept their bitcoin and their lives...
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:23:43
Thing is, nobody knows if there's ever going to be a huge crash. Might well be that bitcoin really is different.

Who are you speaking for? Sunni/Shiite/Salafi/Sufi/Ahmadyya/...? Who is "we" when it comes to Muslims?

I was trying to point out that his intentions are unclear. I'm sceptical that he's something like a messiah, but I obviously wish to the Saudi people that he's going to do more good than harm. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 21:28:41
Yes, you got the parallel I was trying to point out! 
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:06:51
This is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:16:11
Like there should be a disclaimer that Bitcoin is a risky investment?

Switzerland is adopting most if not all EU-legislation, because they find most of it advantageous for themselves.
