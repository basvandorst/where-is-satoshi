1. Escrow &amp; or due diligence
2. They have to obtain the bitcoins either via mining or service provision, sure they can hoard these but it's in their best interests to have bitcoins moving around rather than causing stagnation in the bitconemy.

For remote tasks like the web design it'll be fine, for repairs and data-recovery I think you'll still need to accept fiat but you can always turn that to bitcoin yourself.

The title is kind of worrying though even if it's only a question, if it was just 'DNS problems with bitcointalk' it would be better

Use localbitcoins and avoid the delays, speculators will keep the price zig zagging for a while so it's not worth buying via exchange unless you're holding.

Why in the world would you meet an internet stranger anywhere that doesn't have dozens of other people around? Might not help in the cop situation but it'll stop you being beaten and robbed.
