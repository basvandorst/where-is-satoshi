Because they can't be traced back to an original owner really. If these hit the markets we wouldn't be able to catch anybody using these, especially if they make their own ammo. Thats why our government doesn't want us having it at least, the gun nuts here can't wait though

That whole comment about not knowing about him or BH and then assuming half the people on are 14 year olds, excuse me that wasn't really contradicting as it was hipocritical. Either way it makes you look like a moron or a troll.
