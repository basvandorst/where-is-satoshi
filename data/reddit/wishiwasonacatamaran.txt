Actually two other markets were seized yesterday as well.

I feel bad for any NC State fans in this thread.

Eh, it's better than him just letting people suffer their losses, at least he is trying to do something good for people. 
Back on reddit or back behind bars?

Alright you know what, this is bullshit. You are attacking this man for no real reason. He fucked up, people fuck up, and I'm sure Charlie is a person who is mature enough to admit so. He even offered to repay you for a loss because maybe you were affected. But you weren't. You were not affected. You have no reason to attack him. If you had lost money because of him, he would have fixed it. Jesus I'm tired of people going after each other's throats.

It just hurts for me to be bitcoin involved. I found out about it at $8 a coin and didn't invest....it just hurts man

Technically you do pay for medical care in your country, it's just taken from you a different way.

Have you never drinken whiskey from a coffee mug? Pleb.
@_date: 2017-08-30 00:10:28
Won't argue that. Just think the the wording of the argument of "everybody's health care should be taken care of" is what drives people away. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:05:28
Maybe some. You seem to have a lack of faith in the existence of people who are genuine. They do exist.
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:22:47
By your logic everybody does everything ever with selfish intentions. Even doing things that benefit the greater good. You know. Like what a government is supposed to do.

I wired some money to a prince in Africa (who just needed it to free up his own funds) and he paid me back handsomely. I don't see what the big deal is.
