Thank you!

You can say anything about small amounts of money invested, but it only takes selling and buying the bottom of a good dip to make a huge difference. I started with £500 in May and now I'm in the process of buying a house with a 1/2 of the profits so far. I day trade, never hold a trade longer than 20minutes if it's going well, today's longest was 3mins. 
Dips make a huge difference, the stack increase and the subsequent price jump, make a huge difference. 
Yeah fine I watch the charts and I have alerts for all sorts of bullshit you'd rather not think about. But I have overtaken my pay from my job I started in May also, since September by a significant amount. 
Yeah yeah you can't time the market, but you can sure as anything see a whole ton of buy volume appear after a sell off for a good bounce to trade.
Preach hodl by all means, but remember, if you're willing to risk a little you can make a hell of a lot - as with anything. Technology or not, it's all a gamble anyway.

We shall see what happens until and after the 19th and 26th January when the most popularly traded futures contracts expire

We shall see what happens until and after the 19th and 26th January when the most popularly traded futures contracts, so far, expire. I'm not saying anyone is right or wrong. But this is what I believe the more rational explanation might be.

Whether the contracts are settled financially or not - you could still get someone heavily enough invested to dump the top, creating the top, and then use the financial gain from the increase in value of the contract to cover the decreased profit from keeping up volume selling lower until the effect has snowballed and everyone is selling. Then sell the contract, increase their stack of btc and let it ride back up. There has to be some investment group with enough clout to do this. I'm probably wrong. No doubt there. But it's definitely possible.

I think it might also be that most educated people get into a position where the fiat monetary system is more beneficial to them than it is to the average joe. Bitcoin and Blockchain themselves are not all that complicated to understand, as well as its potential uses and benefits but without specific cases where Bitcoin would benefit an educated person already in a good position in life, past the potential ROI in investment, how are they supposed to believe it's better? 
Sure, they can be their own bank but it really depends on your target audience, some banks bend over backwards for their higher paid customers. Bitcoin attempts to level that advantage. 
I don't disagree with anything that's being said but I can certainly see why it just wouldn't matter to them.

Filters work pretty well. Maybe a keyword filter for "saw this" would take out a fair few posts which you don't want to see.

Just a moment of low liquidity on the btceur. Only takes a second. Look at xlmeur on kraken and you'll see some monsterous versions of this.

It has been in the past, just not for any sustained period of time.

Personally, I have fib levels running from the top of the previous price movement whatever year that was, up to the top of this year's / last year's price movement, and that has a support at 4.6k or so which I have also seen knocking around chats etc. Charts could be telling fibs though.
But as others have said, why would it actually stop at 4/5k? Just talking tradable bounces here.

I guess the issue is that no one wants to buy incase the price drops / no one can afford to buy any more than they already have. So this leaves only sellers, and bots.
I haven't made a trade in a week, I used to trade multiple times a day. More profit can be found elsewhere for anyone bothered.

Have you got a sellers guide? Getting money out is much harder at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:44:47
Good answer.

They'd be able to buy a Bitcoin for that value too.

There are a lot of people buying crypto because it will make them money. A lot of those people do not care about decentralisation/anonymity/wahtever the other people are concerned about. Move on.
