I like CampBX, Dwolla was the thing I had issues with, there is very little transparency into the transfers you make via the service. I think that could be part of the appeal, but...yeah. I need to know where my money is if I am trusting you with moving it.

If they were laundering you'd figure it be more dispersed...rather than drawing this much attention from such a large transaction.
@_date: 2013-06-10 19:48:34
Nope, if the money comes from good sources it isn't.
Just something to watch out for. Lots of shady people everywhere.

Oh no this generally hoarded [item] is not being traded for [specific amount of currency] so it must not have any real value at all!

You can also ask people who have BTC to buy them through Dwolla (buy through them) if your accounts are frozen.
Although that's essentially money laundering, and may (most likely) be illegal in your jurisdiction.
@_date: 2013-06-17 06:06:23
That looks awesome!

I've only used bitcoin by going as far as setting up a wallet and grabbing a coin a while ago. I am really curious as to if bitcoin is being actively used day to day and how.

Green Ave market has a new restaurant around the corner. Oxford Kitchen I think. Manager at the shop was saying they were going to accept BTC there. Super nice dude.

There is always the forgot password link, no?

We should be wary that you cancelled your account before you could resolve the issue of you spending too much money?
I've never had a problem with Coinbase.

You know, I was thinking something along those lines, but I wanted to point out the other end of the spectrum here.
Ideally, the whole concept is GREAT. I like it a lot. But to justify the cost, which is pretty high, you'd have to have the infrastructure in place beforehand.
Other than that, a great option would be to link Coinbase/Etc in the Router/Switch itself.

I checked out bitcoinstore earlier in the week. It's pretty cool. I will have to grab some more coin next paycheck. I think I will use it as a liquid savings account (for short term saving 1-2 months) I need a new video card...lol

I'd throw in a coin to get this developed.

And just when the value hops too. =\

Hey there. 
As for a web based wallet, I usually use Coinbase. But the good thing about BTC is that as long as you can back up your wallet's files. You can link them anywhere. Right now, I use Google Drive, but you can easily setup an rsync command from linux, and maintain your wallet through Multibit on a headed system.
To secure your files:
May help.

I've used it to get a BTC, I didn't have any issues, just takes a few days for the banks to transfer money and Dwolla has to verify your account, etc.
The longest wait I had through the process was the 4 days it took to verify my account on Dwolla, and then the 3 days it took for the funds to clear. I'd rather wait a little while and then get the money to clear than take risks with less reliable services imho.

It was weird, when I grabbed a coin last week, it didn't make me wait 30 days.

Think link to the transaction which is publicly visible. I just need to take a look at it.

There is no order confirmation page. I accidentally pre-ordered. I hope they can cancel it. Shit. 
@_date: 2013-10-21 19:54:11
Looks like you need to have a valid credit card on file...I haven't bought from Coinbase since I saw that. Especially with the beta tag next to it.
@_date: 2013-05-02 00:28:56
Good catch dude. Have an upvote.
@_date: 2013-09-12 20:22:55
That is certainly a way save yourself a few bucks, if you don't mind committing fraud. lol
@_date: 2013-05-02 00:30:49
Which are the better ones?
@_date: 2013-07-24 16:10:50
I wouldn't suggest it...it's not made for currency exchange...just money spending.

You can still acquire shares of private companies, for investing. That's how stock options and angel investing often work with startups.

I believe they are trying to make a profit.

Once you have funds in CampBX, you could let them sit as fiat currency. You don't HAVE to buy BTC at any point other than when you choose their worth to you (by spending).
@_date: 2013-08-29 17:08:41
How does this work if your userbase has no BTC?
@_date: 2013-05-02 01:18:55
I was toying with the idea of trying this too. Maybe after a few more weeks, when I can take a day off.
Nice writing though!
@_date: 2013-06-18 15:15:30
Takes me about 4 business days typically.
@_date: 2013-05-02 01:19:51
Have you looked into Coinbase.com?
I don't know the details but it looked straightforward to set up as  BTC payment option.
@_date: 2013-07-04 12:59:49
I don't get it. They suspend withdrawals for two weeks, and they need to process a two week back log? Doesn't add up. Not at all.
@_date: 2013-06-07 04:59:44
Hey man. I can most likely just buy some off you for cash. PM me some details.

So $350 + $5000 = 5350 total cost of running an internet hub, where you most likely have a coffee shop operating with free WiFi as a competitor.
Makes sense.
@_date: 2013-05-02 01:27:18
I don't believe they do that as a standard practice. Have you opened a support ticket?
And just to check, are you factoring in the fee for trades? I think it is somewhere around 6% from memory, so you'd have to add that into your balance to make trades.

I think this has some merit, but I have been using my 1 btc to play on some online poker sites. Unfortunately I am now at .01 btc in my wallet, but it has value, and that means to me...that it is infinitely better than betting nothing (to learn some skill at poker anyway).
So for me, it's a real currency. You do however have a very strong point here.
