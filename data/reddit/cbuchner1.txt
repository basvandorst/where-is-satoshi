Yeah, like chip &amp; pin (EMV) credit cards? c't has shown that a lot of banks fail to properly validate transactions, so clones of cards can be made that allow for fraudulent transactions without knowing the original card holder's pin.

How about banks first make their own payment systems secure before bashing crypto currencies for lack of security.

You should do some detective work while the evidence is still in your email and browsing history.
Scan your browser history for URLs that could have been the phishing site. Check through which sources you've received the link (Email, online chat, ...). Or maybe it was it an innocent looking typo in the URL and someone abusing mistyped URLs for phishing?
You could do the community a favor by figuring this out and posting a description of the scam.

Nope, Windows desktop applications can receive notifications of pending reboots, and delay these until the application has cleanly shut down.
Text editors do this for example if the document in the editor has unsaved changes.
There is an option to override this and to force a shut down, and *that* would be considered a user error with the bitcoin client still running.
