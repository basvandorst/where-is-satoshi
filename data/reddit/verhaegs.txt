The size of the transaction is bigger. Each transaction can have multiple inputs and multiple outputs. Each input has to be spend fully so likely most of the time one of the outputs in going as change to yourself. But if in a next payment you need to pay 2BTC and you have 4 0.5BTC change outputs from previous transactions this can be used as four inputs to the transaction and one output to the payee.
The list of unspent outputs is called the UTXO set.

I don't have any technical problem with SegWit but I find on-chain scaling currently higher priority than the improvements in SegWit. If there would be node software with BU and SegWit combined I would run that.
I am in Bitcoin to payments as common as credit card one, e.g. peer-to-peer electronic cash. Both SegWit with 1.7-2.0X and Schnorr with 1.3-1.4X increase in block size won't be enough to allow for that. Lightning networks can make things like micro-payments possible that are not typical done with credit cards. But due to some of the characteristics e.g. being prepaid channels and the need of a on-chain transaction for both opening and closing a channel I don't see it amplifying the credit card style transaction capability - with a lot of users doing relative low number of transactions - as some people see it doing.
So in the end a hard fork will be needed anyway so it's better to work on that as highest priority as waiting will only make it more difficult.
Also the fee market is not a high priority to me, we can still wait at least for two halvenings before starting to really care about it. If we in the mean time increase the number of transactions per second considerably the fee per transaction can be kept lower.
In the long term I agree that every transaction can not pass through each node and we need some kind of sharding; the best implementation for that I leave to the experts. Unfortunately nothing seem to progressing on that aspect as the different parties in the bitcoin world seem to want to fight some shorter term battles...
Also doesn't consensus mean that I am allowed to have another opinion than Bitcoin Core and that I should follow if I am convinced it's the right way ? I am not mining so won't generate too large blocks I am just signaling on-chain scaling is my current highest priority.
@_date: 2017-03-08 19:29:57
I did read the two bitcoinmagazine articles but I did find it contained quite some hyperbole in the anti-BU parts and too dismissing on the economic theories put forward by the BU camp. Given the journalistic quality normally seen in other Aaron articles I can only blame it on "Jonny1000" who contributed to these articles.
What in the end we are talking about is replacing a hard coded limit in the code - that btw is also determined by humans - with a more dynamic determination of this number. As said in my previous post I am convinced current value is far too low anyway and the short term one-time scaling solutions won't solve this. Also it is a given you have to trust at least 51% of your miners or you are screwed anyway, that is a given in Bitcoin. Some people even claim it has to be 75% or even higher.
In my opinion it should not be up to the bitcoin developers to make final decision on this limit, it's an economic decision and that should not be determined by coders. In this respect I follow Gavin. I do find on some points Bitcoin Core is acting too much like the central bank of Bitcoin, e.g. they are the experts and know what is best for things like the transaction fee market. I have a natural distrust for people claiming to be experts and thus therefor should earn my trust.
I do agree the BU proposal is putting everything in the miners camp which is also ideal and is thus candidate for improvement but is at the moment IMO the best (or less bad) what is available. If Bitcoin Core gets their act together and continue working on their promised hard fork proposal where also bitcoin hodlers could voice their preference in a decentralized way I may well switch; of course given that it does not have technical problems not currently known and is not coupled with some other problematic policy changes.
I am certainly not going to support something ridiculous like reducing the size (temporary) to 300KB.

I basically agree although I won't hesitate to switch crypto if Bitcoin can't in the end solve it's problems. Indeed, with the current infighting the whole Bitcoin community is the losing side.
In the Linux world at a certain point there was a similar split between the core kernel and the Android kernel developers. This was stopped by Linus who declared that the discussion should be about how to merge Android patches into core kernel and not whether to do it. Unfortunately with the disappearance of Satoshi I don't see anybody in the Bitcoin community with the authority to declare that from now on discussions should be about how to combine on-chain scaling with layer 2 scaling and not whether to do one or the other.
The more intense the infighting in the Bitcoin community becomes the more ethereum looks the way out to me. They are doing both types of scaling and also looking at sharding.

The question is which part of the market is determining this high price. Is it the classical financial market to which Bitcoin has become an investment and to which Bitcoin was a reaction or is it the day-to-day user ?

AFAIK different channels don't see what is spent in the other channels. So either you allow only one channel per wallet or you need to block money locked in a channel so it can't be spent as normal BTC, e.g. the original stance.

On global scale Bitcoin is still peanuts and can still be tamed by heavily restricting what regural banks under state control can do with it. The speculation by the youngster on normal stock markets is also a much bigger problem for them at the moment.
Given that a lot of these Chinese miners are loners I don't think at the moment Chinese government is trying to control them directly at the moment.

@_date: 2017-03-06 11:28:22
You should not only look at transactions per second but also to number of users. Each user needs at least one channel and this opening has to be done on-chain (max 3 new channels per second). Even with lightning network we are far away a serving the same amount of users as VISA (&gt;800M).

There are several things included in SegWit; some less controversial some more. Including them in one block and have an all or nothing decision is already a political act in itself.

I see regularly Core dev(s) claiming hard forks are just too difficult and we don't need them anyway.
@_date: 2016-11-28 09:05:39
I do think it is the wrong question. To me the question is how many users can be served.
With lightning networks you can go to almost infinitive tps by having a relative low number of channels doing humongous amount of processing.
This is not like the VISA network that is often taken as reference where a high number of users are doing low number of transactions.
@_date: 2016-11-24 19:30:26
SegWit only increases blocksize with a factor 1.7 and Schnorr is thought to have 1.4x increase.

There are much more options.
Bitcoin is also open source, so I have the choice to make patches to the code and discuss improvements with other developers and finally have a compromis patch merged in one or more of the bitcoin trees.
In order to activate SegWit there is 95% concensus needed, miners have the option to activate it or not.
I have the option to speak out over my priority in Bitcoin scaling, not only just take or leave.

I don't find the reference back to the 'hard too hard' but did post that block size should go down rather then go up: 
Some other remarks:
* Also the signatures of the core devs seem to be of end of last year. So it is difficult to know if it is accurate.
* The scaling post also seems to focus on 'non-bandwidth-increasing' e.g. off-chain scaling, so people who stand behind the post can well think layer 2 scaling is enough.
* There were some proposals for flexible block size and things like that, but I don't see anything happening related to that from the Core side. I don't get the impression anymore that the reason for SegWit is to allow easier on-chain hard-fork scaling in the longer term.
* As far as I know a new user needs to make at least two on-chain transactions to open 1 side-channel in order to be able to do off-chain transactions: 1 to recieve bitcoin and 1 to lock it into a channel. Given this fact I do see a need to increase block size with at least a factor of 10 in order to reach VISA scale number of users (&gt;800M) in a reasonable time frame.
@_date: 2016-12-05 23:38:42
For each new user at least two on-chain transactions need to be made before he has a LN channel. One to get bitcoins and one to lock the bitcoins into a channel.
If we take VISA with currently more than 800million users you need 1.6G on-chain transactions to get that many open channels. With 1MB block size you can have 250 000 transactions a day so it will take 17.5 years to get that number of channels. Let's take effective block of 2MB with SegWit and another 1.4 increase for Schnorr you still need 6.2years of using all blocks filled only with opening of channels.
If bitcoin decides to not be a peer-to-peer cash system I'm sure altcoins will take over.

I am sure core developer are smart enough to not go for the all or nothing after the deadline. I'm sure they will search for a compromise to get (most of) the advantages in the Bitcoin protocol. Maybe - god forbid - do it via a hard fork if that would be able to get the needed consensus...

I have seen this comment a few times lately but ~~as far I can see in deeds the work on finding out the risks of hard forks is on hold~~.
Edit: Just read [this]( so it seems there luckily is some more work ongoing then I lately perceived by looking the wrong places although it seems to be not free of the necessary political maneuvering. I really hope the involved miners and devs can get out of this catch-22.
I also hope they don't require a 95% of all users signaling before a 'soft-hardfork' because then you are 100% sure it never will happen.
@_date: 2016-11-21 19:22:16

@_date: 2016-11-24 19:37:51
I agree, there is a trade-off but in the long term in my opinion we will need sharding to scale. Unfortunately I don't see anything happening in that respect. I now see some camps bittering on a small term scaling problem and all losing at the same time.
@_date: 2016-11-10 12:27:18
Don't see why. Maybe in the github age people may not realise that version control systems like git were called DVCS e.g. distributed (=decentralized in Bitcoin terms) version control system in opposition to subversion which was centralized.
In git everybody can have it's repository and freely take patches from repos from somebody else. It does need some common way of working or the picking of patches becomes too much overhead.
The current bitcoin source code in not modular enough which means that maintaining patches and keep it based on most recent code generates too much overhead.

Nice thing about language is that it's not science and one can change word meanings.
In the end it does not matter how you call it. I consider it as an immature altcoin but in it's immaturity is also more free to tackle problems. It does not seem ready for broad adaption but due to the infighting in the Bitcoin seems likely to be able to in the mid-term tackle the scaling problem to become a globally used peer-to-peer cash system.

I'm in this camp, I don't see how we can get to 800 million users (this is current number of VISA cards) with current proposed off-chain scaling methods. Off-chain scaling is to make things like micro-payments possible that are not fit for current payment methods like VISA etc.

I own bitcoins but my main interest in Bitcoin is for being able to buy things with it over the world. A peer-to-peer cash system as described in a white paper by some guy named Satoshi Nakamoto.
To be able to do that it needs to have value and should be somewhat stable in value. It's not my main storage of value, that is my house I built and where I'm now repaying the mortgage.


But for gold there are certain regions like India where a lot of people put a lot of value in it; also girls like it to show off/feel beautiful.

I have a server for 20EUR/month that is currently running Bitcoin full node together with Litecoin, NXT and Ethereum; I have 1TB of storage. You don't need SSD speed for disk storage as network bandwidth is limiting factor and could enable pruning and still run a fully validating node.

I agree having all nodes in the same datacenter would not be good; reason I did not name my provider and it's not AWS or google. It's an IAAS provider just providing the hardware, OS I have to take care of and is not part of their support and not something they want to have to take care of.
But the same reasoning can be done for having nodes concentrated in home ISPs.
If Verizon, or AT&amp;T decides or is forced to block miners you have the same problem. And because that domestic ISP connections typically fall under telecommunication laws, government typically has more control over them than your datacenter datapipe.
PS: In the end I do think it is an illusion anyway to think that Bitcoin could resist being blocked by government and still be usable as day-to-day peer-2-peer cash system.

Big difference is that each hop in the network can decide on a fee for passing the transaction. This makes the routing algorithm much more complex than Tor. Maybe I missed something but as far as I know this routing problem was not solved yet.

Of course, people who think that one can have bitcoin without approval of the government are having false hope.
Likely the government will never be able to stop you from having a few private keys to which some bitcoin are linked but they will be able to stop you from using it as everyday cash or even store of value.
This includes running nodes etc.
Luckily most of the (democratic) governments don't seem to have the intention of making Bitcoin illegal.

Indeed, IPv6 is the simple solution for IPv4 address shortage; it works and has plenty of addresses. Sometimes KISS (keep it simple stupid) is the best engineering solution but a good project leader is sometimes needed as engineers sometimes have the habit to make things too complicated[*].
Watch the video again and think in one channel operation per month per user; with channel operation closing or opening a channel. segwit2x has enabled segwit which enables side chains but for side chains to flourish also enough on-chain capacity needs to be in place. I would say we need two orders of magnitude on-chain scaling and the other 5 to 6 orders of magnitude have to be taken up by off-chain scaling solutions.

@_date: 2019-04-08 10:54:03


The block size determines how many channels you can open per second. Some time ago I did some calculation of how long it would take to make as much LN channels as there are credit cards. This was several years and I made the assumption that the blocks would solely be filled with LN opening transactions; no closing of channels, no other bitcoin transactions and no extra channels for payment hubs.  
I did include segwit in computation but not Schnorr signatures and things like that.
@_date: 2017-04-01 18:07:25
The problem is that the channel has to be big enough for the wages to be paid and that money will be locked into the channel even if you spend that money. So for the wage payer that whole amount of money has to be invested.
@_date: 2017-04-05 11:07:56






That's not what I meant. Let's take this channel configuration (1 sender S, 3 intermediate processors P1, P2, P3 and 1 receiver R=me):
       |- P1 -|
    S -|- P2 -|- R
       |- P3 -|
S wants to send 1.5BTC to me; P1 can still send 0.3, P2 0.4 and P3 0.3. So 1BTC in total. How is it then decided which channel to make bigger or to make a full new channel ? Even if a new channel will be generated for the 1.5BTC will R then need to be involved before the BTC can actually be sent through LN ?
If only 0.7 needs to be sent, will then two channels be combined ? Or has S to split it up and R has to know two payments belong to each other ?
@_date: 2019-04-08 13:45:26
Every transaction takes a number of bytes; each block has a maximum size; blocks are on average only produced at a certain rate. Thus block size determines the number of transactions possible per second.
@_date: 2017-04-05 18:27:05






I meant that S had enough channels open with P1-3 - let's say 1BTC with P1-3 each - but R can't receive 1.5BTC in total as only 1BTC left to send in the channels open to him.
@_date: 2017-04-04 17:33:05


But the payment processors who provision their channels with more bandwidth than the first payment need to invest the extra money, it's not something they got from third party to give to you but that they need to have available when opening the channel.
BTW, is there a mechanism to create a new channel when a user needs to receive an money that is above the amount he can currently receive through it's open channels ? I have never seen talk about that.


Now that is a problem. If I have a lot channels it means I need to do a lot more  transactions to take actual transaction of chain. I'm not really looking at microtransactions because that's not what VISA is currently used for either.
What number of users are you planning to reach with Bitcoin ? Did you try to calculate how long it would take with current tps or even with SegWit included to give all of them lot's of channels ?
@_date: 2019-04-08 13:50:08
In the end what counts is how much data has to be stored of each channel opening and how much they want to limit the growth of this data.  
So there is trade-off between the number of users and the effort needed to run a full node.

If the payer of the wage needs to pay 3BTC to me he needs to open a channel of 3BTC from his side. That 3BTC will be locked into the channel even if I spend part of the amount through LN. Additionally I have to spend this BTC through the channel of the wage payer or close the channel. In the former case the wage payer determines the fee to route my payment, in the latter I have to pay the on-chain transaction fee which the small blockers want to become big.
If next month the payer has to pay me 3BTC again and I only have spend 1BTC from previous month he will need to make a new channel of 2BTC or close the old channel and make a new one of 5BTC.
Given all this I think the possible transaction reduction possibility of LN is highly overrated and I don't see how this system can be made behind-the-scene for the user.


I'm no Bitcoin maximalist and am running a bitcoin, litecoin, NXT and ethereum node. Currently bitcoin is still the reference crypto but if the devs of all bitcoin camps are not able to solve their problems it won't stay that way.

No, the block size determines the number of channels that can be opened per second. The only way to increase it is to increase the effective block size; e.g. store more data off-chain or increase the main chain block size.
Other improvements in LN won't have any impact on the number of channels that can be opened per second.
@_date: 2017-04-03 23:37:38






Exactly, the channel is 3BTC in my direction but I still have 2BTC so the payer can only send 1BTC in that channel to me and thus has to open a new channel for 2BTC. The payer could have made a channel of 5BTC the first time but then he would need ot have invested 2BTC from himself in the channel.
As rightly pointed out by the first 3BTC payment should not be seen as needing to locking in money but conversion of on-chain BTC to LN BTC, so exagerrated the problem in my previous post.














In your system Coinbase starts to look more as a classical bank. I agree not with fractional reserve banking or me not loosing money when Coinbase goes bankrupt. But it is far away of me having my own paper or Trevor wallet.
In your system if on-chain fees are high I am basically locked in to Coinbase as closing the channels would cost me too much; in such a regime Coinbase will also be able to ask higher fees for LN transactions if not too high compared to on-chain fees.
I am not against lightning network but it can only function well if also enough on-chain bandwidth is available. I also think it's main use will be for small to micropayments and not for bigger payments.

One of the most important things to consider is which one you can store the safest. Paper cold storage for bitcoin or for gold, funds, physical gold at bank or at home, ... ?
Looking at long term value storage gold is ingrained in several cultures so it's guaranteed to keep (some) value over time. Bitcoin could still be a hype that will fade away or loose value due to unexpected events. From the other side if bitcoin is here to stay it likely will gain (much) more value over time than gold.

@_date: 2016-10-27 07:24:00
Nice you switch to some virtual cookie story and leave out my real world example of trying to get as many open payment channels as there are currently VISA cards. Problem is I don't see a way to get there in a reasonable amount of time without seriously impacting the normal transactions that still have to happen in parallel until enough people have a payment channel and the routing infrastructure to get the (enlightened) Bitcoin in between the open channels. And then we are not talking about using the side channels for other things like stock trading, ground ownership tracking or other types of smart contracts.
Another remark I am worried about is that the LN proponents to seem to overestimate the average number of transactions that will be done on a payment channel in between opening and closing it. I do see limits in that because users of payment channel have to lock in the maximum amount to transfer at the opening of the channel. So either they have to lock in a lot of money or they will need to do the bigger transaction on-chain again.
I am even worried though because you seem to suggest that end users should not have their own wallet and Bitcoin address anymore and use 'Bitcoin banks' with accounts at the bank corresponding to (part of a) LN payment channel.
I did leave out possible Schnorr acceleration in my example because I did not see any good summary yet on what practical block size compaction is possible using the technique when applied to the Bitcoin block chain. From the Pieter Wuille presentation at the last Scaling conference I did get the message though that practical implementation for Bitcoin is a long way of, and taking LN progress as guidance this probably means that it is a very long way of.
@_date: 2016-10-26 18:09:05

But my transaction sizes are much much smaller. To me the transaction fees are not negligible.
@_date: 2016-10-26 22:45:44


As far as I understood each opening or closing of a channel will also fight for space in the block chain. I don't understand why thinks block size can decrease. According to blockchain.info we now have around 220000 transactions per day. VISA has more than 800M credit cards active. VISA is often taken as reference for scaling target. To replace each of these cards with one open side channel will fill current blockchain for almost 10 years (likely reduce by 40% with SegWit active and used for every opening, e.g. 6 years). Only 1 channel opening per card, no other transactions, no routing channels, no closing because channel not big enough or person in need for the money, ...
@_date: 2016-10-27 19:40:30


Yes I am looking at the longer term scaling. As said there are currently more than 800M VISA cards (not counting the other credit cards). If we have 250k channel opens per day than we have to fill current block chain for 6 years (SegWit compaction is taken into account) to have one open channel for each credit card. And my vision is not only to replace the VISA cards but also serve Bitcoin to the currently unbanked persons.
So at the point LN would really take off and due to network effects have exponential take-up in demand for transactions and/or channels we will have problems.
If I look at  it reports around over 350K births and over 150K deaths today. So the maximum number of current channels operations is less than half of the sum of the births and deaths.
Also me doing 10K of transactions on my LN channel means that I will need to do on average one transaction per day for 30years. I don't see myself doing that. I also need to be able to predict at the start the maximum amount over those 30 years I will spend and lock that money for 30 years. I don't see that as a real use case for me, and I would claim for most users of Bitcoin, it's certainly not how current credit cards are used.
For longer term scaling neither LN or on-chain scaling will provide the necessary scaling and it hurts me that short term scaling fights seem to even hamper Bitcoin progress. We will need on-chain scaling, side channels and sharding to reduce bandwidth requirements of the nodes if we want Bitcoin to stay the reference crypto currency in the long term.

I hope not, it will work better than banks.

The uptake will take 5 year if in the mean the blockchain is not used for anything else than opening payment channels indeed; otherwise it will be much longer and it also means long waiting times for people who want to join unless the uptake is really linear over that period of time.
You seem to see no problem in that, I do. In my opinion, in this fast-paced world Bitcoin's momentum will be gone if it hasn't taken up seriously in 5 years from now.
I guess we'll have to conclude that we don't have anything more to discuss.

Good reference site.
For bandwidth and data cap requirements I think you will need to take SegWit data into account as these also have to pass through the node in order to check validity of the SegWit transaction.
Bandwidth requirement has to be one or two orders of magnitude higher in practice as data comes in bursts not linearly over the whole time in between blocks.
Also for local storage there is a difference wether or not to store the SegWit data.

SegWit multiplication 1.7 =&gt; days is 3200/1.7 = 1882 days = 5.13 years
As said before I don't have reference on practical multiplication by Schnorr applied to Bitcoin blockchain and actually I am less optimistic about it after Peter Wuilles talk on Scaling Bitcoin.
[I was wrong here](*As another reference current population is 7.5billion so 800 million is only 1%. In other contexts and discussions 1% percent is considered just the elite and 99% the normal.*) 800 million is of course 10% not 1%, but target should still be higher than 10%.

For theorical reasoning let's assume the price is fully determined by demand. Every 10 minutes 25 bitcoin are generated and is pretty flat for the last weeks. In these 10 minutes the trade and transaction volume is much higher than this 25 bitcoins. So the theory would then say the extra 25 bitcoins corresponds with the slowly increasing demand for bitcoins.
With the theorical assumptions this means that the If now reward halves only 12.5 will be generated every ten minutes. This should then lead to a small continuous increase in price as now the increase in bitcoin should be a little below the increase in demand.
This is the theory, but I don't think it is the practice as we are not is such an equilibrium. This means that price can go anywhere after the halving and will be determined more by emotions than by economic theory.

It just means Bitfury likely has implemented all possible power optimization and KNC left quite some optimizations on the table likely with an non-optimal choice of 28nm technology.
AFAIK the new 16nm/14nm ASICs are all designed with a flow customized for power efficiency of the bitcoin hashing function and you won't be able to get same efficiency with any 28nm. Maybe it is possible to get a more efficient chip with very low supply voltages but then the hashing rate would be very low so cost per GH/s would be too high.

Both on- and off-chain transactions should scale. The off-chain ones to group transaction by big processing parties, reducing their costs and get these transactions of chain and for returning micro-payments.

For advanced nodes TSMC and GlobalFoundries only sell in bulk. They'll ask hard cash, no fancy contract on revenue from mining. For 16nm/14nm you'll need a few M$ to start production. There exist so called multi-project wafer (MPW) services but this will never allow you to have a competitive price.
