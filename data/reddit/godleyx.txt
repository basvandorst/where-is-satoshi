mmmm... sorry... I think I was talking about coinbase pro. not the coinbase app. yeah, coinbase lets you buy bitcoin immediately. but the fees are like 300x more. with pro you gotta wait 2 weeks to get your money to buy bitcoin with. with the app, you gotta wait the same 2 weeks in order to officially own that bitcoin to transfer it.

We're going to be going on a ride soon... I'm going to put a large investment in because I feel like there's no better time

I didn't realize it was dangerous. I'll edit the numbers out of my post

I moved to coinbase pro to avoid the fees lol. It's like 17 cents versus 3 dollars for what my typical transaction will be.

Hey that's fine. As long as it tells me when they're available. That way I can just forget it. I don't want to be checking in on it all the time because I'll get obsessed watching it.

So I am trying to move my bitcoin over from coinbase to coinbase pro. But I am seeing it says in coinbase pro that my entire bitcoin collection is "funds on hold"...
I purchased bitcoin on jun 26. the transaction was pending for a day and cleared on the 28th. coinbase says I can transfer after the funds clear. but... it cleared 6 days ago so why is it still being held?
also with coinbase pro, it takes longer to put in money to purchase bitcoin eh? but the fees are a lot lower? thats the tradeoff? i am fine with that.

I don't really plan on following it too much anyways. Like I said, I don't want to get obsessed. I just want to toss money weekly. I just plan on being one week ahead. Put in 200 bucks, and make a deposit for 200 which would be available the next week I do it.
I will eventually put a larger amount into cbpro and have it on standby in case I do catch a dip though

So I'm new to this. So far, I invested some money into bitcoin via coinbase when it was like $9800/coin the other day. I have extra money sitting around in the bank I think I'm going to invest as well. I also have two savings accounts with some money each in them. And honestly the second one is redundant, I only used the funds from a savings account once throughout the years. So I'm thinking about closing the second one, and putting that money into bitcoin. I've been thinking about investing it for a while now in an IRA or something. But I already have a pretty good 401k going. So I think I want to invest it into bitcoin. Make it a goal to get to 1 bitcoin eventually and just hold it for a long time.
My question is: when investing a larger amount, should I just go for it whenever? Or should I wait around and wait for a dip? I understand with DCA you can just invest small amounts weekly/bi-weekly and it doesn't make a big deal. But with a larger investment, seems like it would be smart to wait if it dips under 10k again?
Also, are the fees usually pretty high with exchanges? I see coinbase will charge me like a surprisingly high amount just moving money into bitcoin.
Lastly, what should I do about a wallet? I don't really understand bitcoin very much yet. I understand that an exchange app like coinbase you don't really own the bitcoin until it's in a wallet, so I'd like to move the bitcoins to a wallet whenever I can.

Keep my seeds in separate locations? Like... Where is a good place to hide them

I just put in a limit buy order for 10k right when it dipped under 10k, and then it shot right back up. haha. I'll leave the order there in case it drops back down. only a small bit of money, i'd do more but it takes like 2 weeks to put money into coinbase

Doesn't work. It still on a 10 day hold when you deposit cash into coinbase, it doesn't let me transfer it to pro
@_date: 2019-07-06 00:02:06
New user of coinbase pro here. So I had to deposit cash first before I can do anything on there. I'm wondering if they send an email once the funds are available? I just don't want to keep checking.

Somebody stop me from buying an entire bitcoin right now
