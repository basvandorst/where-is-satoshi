I used it yesterday to pay a friend back $100 he loaned me while we were out to save a stop at an ATM.  Best part? He opened up a Coinbase account and my transfer was his first BTC!  One more player in the game ;)
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:51:48
Me too ... this would be a huge one for me.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:22:00
Over time you will recoup from the dip - just be patient and don’t sweat it.

That’s tough :/ in the long run it won’t matter ;)
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:55:54
I see what you did there, and I like your style.

It says lean hogs are down 0.91% as well - better buckle up this is going to get wild, bro.

I would like to recommend Giving Songs - a 501c3 tax exempt charity that helps families with blind, multi-disabled children.  This is an all volunteer organization that records local musicians and makes the music available for free or by donation.  They use the proceeds to help families purchase wheelchair lift vehicles.  It is hyper-efficient and their overhead is less than $300 per month - a bitcoin would be a huge gift that would be utilized very well!
News segment on them:
Their website is being rebuilt at the moment but the url is 
Thanks for the amazing generosity you are showing the community!

They add a $50 premium to the price per coin, something I’ve never minded paying because I like the one-stop-shop service they provide.  There are cheaper ways to get things done though, and the crew on this sub will point you in the right direction, bro.

Government backed crypto may function well but wouldn’t it ultimately be inflationary like any other form of fiat?  
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:22:31
We already see the ‘$18k!? What is going in this is a bubble!’ posts all the time.  
It needed/needs to make some ridiculous gains in order to stay on track for most of the high end price and market cap predictions.  
I regret selling every satoshi I’ve ever parted with - it won’t happen again!  Although I do buy $200/month to transact with as short-term holdings to help drive the currency side of the community.

My theory ... today’s experiment was a baseline measurement on how much ability one whale has to move the market.  Now they have some idea of where they need to set the limits to work the futures. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:31:18
Yes - link please, bro
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:40:58
The 5057 BTC pledge has already increased in value by $14M since the original post - more than the amount distributed to date.  It looks like your plan may be in action already ;)
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:18:28
You ok, bro?
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:18:02
My purchase this morning will be classed as a dip - it was $500 less than the current value. :)  I typically don’t watch the price, but today I’m stuck to my phone.  Exciting stuff - $10,000 USD is right around the corner, bro.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:17:27
If the ultimate value of this currency is in the $50-$100k range there needs to be some period of intense growth.  As we transition from the early adoption phase we will see this kind of market cap increase.  
I’m enjoying the ride, bro.
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:58:56
Don’t you tell me how many pizzas I was going to order with my 40,000 bitcoins!  
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:28:35
I really enjoyed this post - as a 20 year veteran of the trucking industry I can say with confidence that some of the smartest people I know are drivers.  
Thanks for doing what you do - best of luck to you, sir! :)

I don’t really have money to add to my long term BTC savings, but I buy $100 every so often to spend in BTC in an effort to help support the network.  I love to buy at all time highs - it’s my way of saying I have faith in the project, bro.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:38:37
What about the FOMO, bro?
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:49:41
Well I’ll be saving some BTC and spending some BTC while that all sorts itself out, bro.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:25:13
I’m sorry... are you inferring I didn’t buy the $10k dip in advance, bro?  
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:23:04
I know right, bro.
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:32:57
Good to know!  I appreciate the one stop shop with Coinbase - if it were an amount I considered significant I’d walk through those steps. I typically make these purchases on the fly and don’t have the attention span for extra steps.  I’ve been looking at some of the sites that offer multiple cryptos - considering putting a little money into the top 10 and treating them like an index fund with semi regular balancing.  Haven’t really figured out which site would be the best for that.  Thanks for the tip on saving - definitely good to know, bro.
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:45:16
I use it on both ways - I have my core “savings” that will ride the coaster for the next decade or so... I also buy some weekly and use it transactionally in an effort to support the community.

Going to see a spike in mid December from CME as well if they move forward 
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:15:27
I have absolutely zero experience mining, but I’ve seen several people state they wish they just would have bought and held the coins with their investment funds, bro.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:30:41
I do the same thing :) just bought $100 at $8k and another $100 at $9k... 5 days apart lol.
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:40:05
Whatever alt coins split off the chain will also be in cold storage on the same key.
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:33:43
You will get more technical answers and insight from others, I’m sure - but at the end of the day, any copies of the chain will also make a copy of your key and therefore you own that copy as well.
Have a good one!
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:15:58
It went from $8k to $9k in 5 days - it’ll be $10k shortly, bro.

The US national debt appears to be climbing at about $1M per minute.  Ugh.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:51:51
Agree to disagree, bro.

Assuming your beneficiaries are aware of your assets it’s tough for a lawyer to steal them.  Most people who are responsible have some instructions tucked away in a safe location for those we will leave behind - the bitcoin and crypto recovery instructions are just one more page in that envelope.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:13:39
Tempting, isn’t it?  If you can afford to lose (or perhaps multiply) it... then go for it!
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:46:46
Yes - exactly!
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:36:28
The lost coins still get divided into the value per coin, doesn’t matter if they aren’t active, bro.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:54:40
Everybody knows not to buy more than you can afford to lose, bro.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:05:00
Good thing we bought at that dip 9 hours ago, bro!
@_date: 2017-11-18 15:14:39
I was going to use those coins to order four pizzas.
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:43:13
So if I find a hard drive with 100 lost coins on it ... they aren’t worth the market value?  Satoshi’s coins aren’t worth anything?  If I go to coinmarketcap.com and do the math I can see they are treating the denominator as roughly 16.8m coins, available or otherwise, bro.
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:28:19
If the value of BTC is the market cap divided by the number of coins, then yes - the dollar per coin change will be the same for $10B swing regardless of total market value, bro.
In other words - if there were 21,000,000 coins -
A $21M increase to market cap would drive the price $1, regardless of its value, bro.
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:51:01
I have one and load it with $100-$200 per month in spending money - the fees are significant but the soaring value of bitcoin offsets them, at least for now.  
It is a very quick way to turn your BTC into universally spendable fiat.  Ultimately I like the card and enjoy using it.
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:50:38
This has got to be fake news .. yes?
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:20:42
The 818 was me - I’m not sure about the other purchases.  Lol
@_date: 2017-11-04 08:27:03
I’m not your mate, bro.
@_date: 2018-02-21 04:09:37
Who cares ;) BTFD or just HODL but don’t stress yourself out watching BTC value fluctuate.  Buy some and forget about it!
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:31:56
Yes you have them! No idea how to access them with your current wallet... with breadwallet it was easy and they issued instructions.
