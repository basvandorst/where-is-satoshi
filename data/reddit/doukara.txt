Can you send money to Canada? I mean not by bank wire or PayPal but real paper money? I'm using QuadrigaCX for now. And they do offer that service. Its not to be anonymous but I will not be in business with bank anymore by June. Thanks for your reply

"Shortly after PayPal's IPO, the company was acquired by eBay in July 2002 for $1.5 billion, with a valuation of over $23 a share, or 77% above the IPO price. More than 70 percent of all eBay auctions accepted PayPal payments, and roughly 1 in 4 closed auction listings were transacted via PayPal."
Not sure why they would kick themselves out lol. If its not for crytocurrency paiement.
