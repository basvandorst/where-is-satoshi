Took me three passes to not read "disk crash" as "dick rash".
@_date: 2019-03-02 02:21:20
There it is.
@_date: 2019-03-01 12:12:53
Shit, they're really calling me out...
@_date: 2019-03-01 23:36:20
All this proves is that you're kinda a mysogynistic douche.

Next article headline will read "Square planning to pay employees in Bitcoin" and quote this article.
@_date: 2019-03-14 22:16:48
That's some real fear of cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2019-08-17 15:12:10
out of respect

2 years is a long way to go?
@_date: 2019-08-06 22:22:56
Yeah, maybe a bit wishful, but would you have expected us to be where we are now a decade ago?

"It's magic internet money that will probably be the most common world currency in a decade or so (and be worth way more than now of that is the case), I can refer you to some books or websites if you want to learn about how it works."

So all that needs to happen for this to occur is global banks need to begin lowering interest rates below 0%, then a global "blue wave" leading to a worldwide increased taxes on the rich to "never before seen" levels, then a rush into bitcoin, specifically,  to avoid forcible  asset seizure (which ignores the fact that the government doesn't need it's hand in your wallet to put you in jail until you hand over your money 'voluntarily').  
I'm not saying that it can't happen, just there are sure a lot of unprecedented 'if's in there...

Smartest thing I've seen in this entire thread.  
@_date: 2019-02-23 00:55:36
If true, that was really stupid, and you were really lucky.
@_date: 2019-02-14 02:42:20
Not that I don't agree, but "man who likely owns a ton of Bitcoin thinks other people should buy Bitcoin" is not much of a story...

Maybe eventually, but 150 pizza sales a *week* isn't convincing anyone.

So this is a report of various wild ideas they are throwing out there and if one or two are correct in 10 years they'll act like market geniuses for seeing it coming.

@_date: 2019-01-24 20:26:57
Welp, can't argue with that logic.....
@_date: 2019-01-27 11:18:46
The taxes and making sure you're keeping the right records is probably the most important/technical part.  Definitely talk to a tax attorney and probably a CPA also.
@_date: 2019-01-27 11:25:27
So you're worried about a bank refusing to give you your keys from a safety deposit box, but you think it would be safer to put it in *two* banks so now *either* bank can deny you access to your money?
@_date: 2019-01-24 18:18:40


Ah yes, of course. 20% chance.  Triangles.
Alternatively, have you considered that TA in such an insanely new, volatile, and  speculative market is entirely BS and you're pulling numbers out of your ass?

If you ever wear it to another con, you should consider adding a qr code for bitcoin tips somewhere visible.

Why not?  
I dont have the money to put several thousands of dollars into bitcoin today, but I can definitely keep doing a few hundred per month.  
The longer prices stay low, the better off I am when the next bull run occurs. 
@_date: 2019-09-12 12:30:18
There is doubt.  There are oceans of doubt.
@_date: 2019-05-11 15:23:16
Absolutely no idea...which is why I dollar cost average
@_date: 2019-05-16 10:53:07
Nothing makes me feel as bullish as US Congressmen discussing the dangers of Bitcoin.

I feel like this is one of those things that started out as a sarcastic joke, then too many people didn't get the sarcasm and started taking it seriously.
