You have to be realistic. Them accepting some form of crypto is better than the status quo where they accept no crypto at all.

Mtgox was good when it first started but over time as it grew it seems to have a ton of issues. I remember I would tell people to not use it anymore but there wasn't many other alternatives at the time.

Student loan is far worse type of debts and people exaggerate it here. With student loans, when people say default, it is not like a traditional default where you stop paying and can eventually file bankruptcy. With student loans it is virtually impossible to get out of paying them. Even if you stop paying they will just start garnishing your wages and that garnishment will exist until you die! So technically people are still paying their student loans even if they default. The only way it turns into a serious crisis is if you have people fleeing the country or mass unemployment.

It won't. It is like saying all oil is sanctioned purely based on it being oil.

problem is that once their competitors start accepting btc directly then their customers leave. Can't pay your bills without customers.

exactly. I was looking for a vpn provder that accepts btc payments directly. Most of them are using bitpay. I eventually found protonvpn and paid for their premium service directly and I will probably stick with them for a long time because they accept direct btc payments!

not necessarily. If the price of gold drops low enough then it won't be economical to mine it anymore. Any gold that is needed could be obtained from existing mined resource - like scrap jewelry, coins etc.

Problem with the debt issue is that it could take decades for it to really have an impact.

in the same position but I don't want to do the whole ID/KYC crap. I need a lot of bitcoin to buy stuff online. Anyone know any way to do this? Tried selling stuff on open bazaar but no buyers as of now. 
Maybe I should just go to some local meetups and try to trade people in cash? Not sure what to do.

Yes you can but student loans is a debt which cannot be discharged through such a process. There are ways to get it discharged but it is for doing specific stuff (like working 10 years as a public school teacher in a low-income school) or if the debt is imposing an extreme burden on you like in situations where you are seriously and permanent disabled for life.

That's how most people are with any investment - extreme risk aversion. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 03:33:12
agree, no debate on that one.

So where do we begin with this discussion?

People aren't using it lol
