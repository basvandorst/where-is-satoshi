lol, here i agree with you. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 07:02:51
I am receiving international transfers on regular basis, I am a freelancer. For me to receive payments in bitcoin is quite of pain if i want to convert it into fiat right away, i'd better pay bank fee's which are not that big anyways than to receive 10% less because of this volatility. Not to mention that i still need a bank account to be able to cashout bitcoins, and there's a fee on exchanges a fee on withdrawal a fee etc. Try it out and you'll understand what i am talking about.
I am still receiving payments in bitcoin, but only when i am not planning to convert it into fiat. For me bitcoin is like gold, a store of value not a currency.

what about btc-e, it may turn dark someday too, nobody knows who's the owner nor where is located. Those ppl are greedy/stupid too??
And gox was promoted everywhere, from bitcoinfoundation (only gox was gold member from all other existing exchanges), to bitcoin wiki's etc.

Russia has troops in many countries: Moldova, Azerbaijan, Chechnya and all over eastern europe, now even in Ukraine. And not only that they have troops in a foreign countries, in every country they are making separatists zones that are outside of parent country laws and monetary system, in those separatists zones they actively spread propaganda and misinformation's.
If you don't know a shit about russian politics, just shut the fuck up, russia ruined life for many ppl for nothing...

Bitcoin foundation actively promoted gox.  Gox was the only gold member there, in fact no other exchages was ever listed there... 
So foundation actually pushed users to gox even if they knew that gox has serious financial problems, and i am sure they knew it before anybody else.

Bitcoin is far from safest way to store money, its still quite new and nobody knows for sure how it will turn in couple of years. I believe in bitcoin but wouldn't advice anybody to put all their wealth in bitcoin.
Remember, rule nr. 1 in bitcoin investment is to not invest more than you can afford to loose.

@_date: 2014-04-24 21:03:40
even if they don't plan to invest anything in this exchange and use parts of 200k btc's for operating, is still better than liquidation where btc holders most probable will get nothing... I prefer to wait several years to be refunded than to get nothing from liquidation.

fake security. your paper wallet may be vulnerable too, some poor random, maybe some flaw in random number generator maybe you generated it on a vulnerable/exposed system. 
You can't claim that you are secure, security is a process not a state.

Even if marketcap will remain the same there will be a drop in price. There are 1312500 bitcoins mined yearly, 109375 monthly and around 3645 daily. To keep the same price ($315) we need 1148175$ of new money daily.

you can use bank transfers, fixed fee (usually quite small) and with large amounts is really convenient. Or you can use bitcoin but with these fluctuations in price you can loose. I am a freelancer as well and i am using bitcoins for small/medium amounts and banks for big ones.

And I have dozens of friends in Ukraine that feel that this is a russian occupation. Cmon man, wake up. I am not pro-usa or anti-russia. I am for human rights and civilization, when a foreign country comes with troops in your country killing everybody in left and right then claiming that they are saving you, is just not right.

this hangout was interesting till ssh part, cmon guys, do you really think Karpeles used hand written ssh server at mtgox? He did a ssh server in php, and as he even stated it was for education purposes, it doesn't mean that he used it in production... There are so many things to blame on Karpeles, but this ssh server thing is not one of them....

license number will be changed in new ID, unique personal identification number will be unchanged though.

Transaction can differ, it may have different number of inputs, may have different number of outputs thus different size. So I guess that they have fee to cover even most expensive transactions.
Anyway when talking about some cents, even if they have thousands withdrawals per day, the total amount of bitcoins they have from this is negligible. Also I don't think that this fee may discourage withdrawals :D nether small/frequent withdrawals, they can simply put a limit in backend for minimum allowed amount to withdraw :|
