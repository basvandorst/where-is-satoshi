We are on OB, but the store isn't permanent yet. 
@_date: 2016-04-16 04:16:13
We're working on it, but we've been in business just fine so far.

Nothing would happen to your bitcoins. In fact you don't need a computer, you can keep all your bitcoins in a brain wallet.

They are American Apparel, the softest most comfy tee you'll ever wear. Great quality!
@_date: 2016-04-16 06:03:25
They are produced on American Apparel, the softest, most comfy tee you'll ever wear. Produced in the America's, sweatshop free.

We're on OB full time now!
@_date: 2016-04-16 02:33:18
Sorry to hear that! We will be more than happy to send you an exchange as the picture is an accurate representation of what the tee should look like. We want you to be happy with the product. You'll be contacted by our support staff to arrange the replacement

No costs to list and sell the shirt. We already accept doge. Would be able to list it on premium quality American Apparel for $19.99.
flat rate of $4 for domestic shipping, no matter how many you order, $9 flat rate for international shipping. We would ship each tee within 3 business days.
@_date: 2017-03-13 00:02:16
USPS charges $2.95 for First Class Mail and $6.35 for USPS Priority. That excludes packaging or labour costs. However, we agree. Unfortunately that's the price the vendor charges for this product :(.
@_date: 2017-03-13 00:02:49
Unfortunately not with the low margins that come from Hardware. However, we will be doing a discount on hardware in the next few months, so stay tuned!

While the Feds didn't orchestrate SR, they did set up Ross Ulbricht on the hire to kill scheme.
Ross was an entrepreneur and innovator who reduced crime and improved the quality of products that people are going to buy whether they are legal or illegal.
The US used to be called the land of the free. However there are now more people in prison in the US, total and per capita, than any other place in the world. So much for letting people live their lives...

We would be happy to sell that shirt and accept doge for it. And we ship quickly and internationally

We did not say 10% of the profits.
We said 10% of the product sale. Please note that there is a difference between revenue and profit.
In reality, after all expenses of buying, producing, marketing, and shipping the tee, we are donating about 50% of the profits.
@_date: 2016-03-02 17:19:10
We use BitPay and GoCoin, and may expand the ways we accept bitcoin in the future.
@_date: 2016-03-16 16:04:17
Haha, we are working on it!
@_date: 2016-03-03 04:57:31
Haha, it's not for everyone. What kind of ideas are you thinking? Feel free to submit your ideas for tips!
@_date: 2016-03-02 21:13:36
Will do. We send the payments to Free Ross via bitcoin, and tweet the tx, and will include it there.
You're absolutely right. Statists are gonna state.
@_date: 2016-03-02 18:27:21
Thank you so much for the great idea! We just contacted Shape Shift.

Unfortunately our suppliers do not accept crypto. Our press release does state that we accept antiquated payment methods as well. Why would we restrict ourselves from receiving someone's money?
The more you buy, the more business we do, the more we can negotiate with our vendors and ask them to accept bitcoin.

Perhaps "bitcoin" is not a honey badger in its current form as a technology protocol and  because of the people who run it. But bitcoin, the idea, is a honey badger that will be around for a very long time.

have 1,000 satoshis on me, Bitcoin_forever! Great idea! We really dislike IP Statists. We'd love to do a tee like that. We have a lot of new stuff in the works, though. If we can get the idea right for what the tee should be, we can get it available in a week or two.
@_date: 2016-03-09 15:44:14
You sure can!

Yes you can.
You can pay for it in bitcoin, dogecoin, litecoin, or any of the antiquated legacy payment systems.

Newsflash! You cannot legislate morality.
Newsflash! Victimless crimes shouldn't be crimes. Most people in prison in the US are there for victimless crimes.
There's a difference between law and legislation. Ross Ulbricht did not break the law, he broke legislation.
I didn't say anything about there being no jails in the "land of the free." I said it's ridiculous that 1 out of 4 people in the US under the age of 30 has been arrested and put in jail for victimless crimes. That more people are in jail in the US than most other countries, combined.

All Things Decentral is run by the same people who created and founded The Bitcoin Store originally.
They are no longer affiliated with the bitcoin.com store, though. So two different entities. We are rebranding to All Things Decentral so that there is no confusion.

I think btc proves his regression theory. It's being commoditized before it becomes money.
Even if gold was money before it was used as jewelry or teeth fillings it was a commodity before it was money.

Yes, and the banks continued to shut down bitcoin businesses through 2014, 2015, 2016. Bitcoin has been stifled in NZ for some time compared to other countries that have fostered much larger bitcoin communities and companies that accept BTC.

You just pointed to a completely different product and brand. We are selling a premium product, produced on American Apparel.
@_date: 2016-02-18 18:07:07
The reason why it is $10 more is because of the customization. We can either do one with our QR code for $19.99 or no QR code for $19.99. Which one would you prefer, and we will make it happen!

We sell these at  We know why we sell these and what they represent. The artist made these for his organization called Bitcoin not Bombs. This is a take of Banksy and represents peace. Bitcoin is voluntary and nonviolent and puts restrictions on things like central banking which in the long-run restricts government monetary policy. That means governments don't have the ability to spend trillions of dollars on warfare like they have over the last 20 years.

I recommend reading the whitepaper:
As it could not have used bitcoin, and it's not really a competitor =/.

It has a much lower market cap. The available supply of Steem is only 2-3 million.
