Yo compro a través de SatoshiTango. Te haces una cuenta, cargas fondos en pesos y con ellos compras bitcoins. Y los sacas de ahí a una billetera fría (Trezor o Ledger).

The same happened to me a few hours ago. I am in Argentina and wanted to transfer bitcoins from a paper wallet to my brand new Trezor. My antivirus did the same, but told me that the address was wrong. Hope it will be solved soon!
