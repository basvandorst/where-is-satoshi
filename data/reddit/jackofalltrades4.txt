Since it is just 12 words, and not the old 17 words one, yours is BIP 39 encrypted. Weird how it doesn't recover your wallet though. I'd wait for the wallet ID from the customer support. But DO NOT give them the words !

I once used coinomi to claim Bitcoin Gold. THe recovery words worked. Although I moved my coins from blockchain.info before doing this, it worked as expected. I am sure it would work for you.

Your 12 words (recovery words/seed) is the wallet ! You can use that to recover the coins from any free software based wallet in the market.

It already trades at a much higher price than the US. This will sure make people panic. 
At the moment 1 BTC in US - 16200, 1 BTC in India - 1180000 rupees ( around 18200 US dollars)

Although I did not want to do that for almost a year, I have just done that because I need the money. How long have you been holding and what price do you think we should get back in ? Any predictions ? How bad is the FUD among the people around you ? 
Edit : I meant that I have been holding for more than a year.

If you're going to put all your net worth in just bitcoin, you probably would deserve it. Even us believers would only have 30% max in that type of world. Rest would be Teslas and SpaceX 'around the world in 80 minutes' tickets. 
Edit : It would be like when credit/debit cards came around, then you could point a gun at someone's head, and get their net worth. Sounds ridiculous? Exactly !

Oh yeah ! I have been following this thread for quite sometime to realize that. I just wanted to know what the FUD is like in other countries ! That could give us an idea of when to get back in.

It is* paramount.

Then, there are people who think bitcoin is really done for good ! I just hope I don't get too greedy on the way down, or miss the way up. All the best !

A healthy dose of fear, uncertainty and doubt in initial year, then, good laughs at people spreading fear, and, at times, 'noobs' asking dumb questions.
