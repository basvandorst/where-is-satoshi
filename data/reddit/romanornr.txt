I have a stop buy order ready arround 470
If the market goes back to 470 my buy orders of btc will be executed. I have a alarm to, to check if it isn't a bull trap. 
I failed many times, to find great ways to lock in profits.

We both need bulls and bears in the market a agree. But if you want to take the risk for everyone and maybe end up with suicide.. Or having stress and health problems... Be my guest 
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:29:32
Drunk? I don't drink. 
High, yes but not Because I smoked Hasj or weed but because I see my profits on my short of btc. 
Because I'm shorting btc at the Moment. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:22:31
Long term or short term. What is short term for you? 
IF you sold at 800$ and bought back at 400$
You could have doubled your bitcoins... 
Sorry but for me it looks like a pretty good deal. 
More btc, more btc for in the future to buy shit with. 
For the people who are still hating, they just have a big ego and having a bad day because of btc today.

Sorry, didn't knew that

Sorry for my bad English. I'm Dutch, so English is not my mother language. 
The other traders are really good. Well everyone knows people they don't like lol

Alright alright, sorry for the confusing title. 
But some people need a reality check. 
Before they lose are their money on bad trades and panic. 
If you still don't get the message after reading my post, and still in denial you're arrogant.. 
Yeah then go on and hope btc will go 10000..! 
It isn't healthy to stress so much. 
If I can help a few people for in the future, to don't do suicide Because of btc going down, I'm happy

I guess this is the most commented and Most downvoted thread of today... I feel like.. Feel like.. JUSTIN FCKING BIEBER lmao. 
Keep asking questions guys, I answer everything! 
What a service huh! 
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:06:57
I could explain it for free. Sadly the most reddit users here are to arrogant and downvoting this. 
But feel free to tweet me and ask the questions. 
It's not a service. It's just technical analysis and trading on bitfinex where I can use limit, trailing and stop orders. 
If you need help, you can always tweet me RNR_0
I can even learn you how to short (making money while btc price is going down instead of going up) and trade with leverage . 
You have 1 btc but you can trade with 2 btc. Double your profits. 
So everyone?... 
Do you guys still think I'm stupid? 
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:51:29
It's better to don't play Hmm maybe.. Because I see the biggest btc spectaculars here... Don't even know what's happening now. 
It's not a ponzi.. But there are whales (people with significant bankrolls that their actions impact heavily on the markets)  who can manipulate the prices. 
Price &amp;  value are 2 things. I agree. 
But for now China is the problem. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:47:26
Market manipulation? Did you just really said I'm trying to manipulate the market. I try to help people here before I see a suicide line tommorow. 
I care about people instead of only btc. 
If I can help people before they lose a lot money, I'm happy. 
Maybe you should look up what market manipulation means ;)  
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:43:12
I could put the alarm of If I want. And put a buy order only. 
Believe me, you're missing out.
My alarm woked me up only one time in these last 2 months. 
Most of the time I know where The resistance and support is. 
I sell if the support breaks etc etc.. 
And yes I'm answering every fucking thing. 
So everyone else, ask those questions.

How cute, a little boy with not even 1 or 0.1 btc
So.....  Yeah I don't even have words for it. 
But I made my point, and you know I'm right about the sell, and buy lower.
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:32:59
Sorry for the confusing title then. I hope you get the point of this thread instead of only reading the title. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:14:58
Acting like a scumbag because all the nice guys of twitter tried to talk you guys and open your eyes. 
I still don't know how I can open the eyes of the reddit users here. 
Even little sluts with sperm in their eyes would notice that it's the best to sell btc and buy back lower. 
Logic :)  but hey some people are so scared to try anything.. That they just hope the price will go up. 
Whoops I acted like a scumbag to you. But hey maybe someday you will get the point of this thread.
