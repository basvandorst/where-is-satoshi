Coins that were the output of a transaction greater than 1 year ago are growing to be a larger part of the total UTXO balance. In other words, the % of coins that haven't moved for over a year is growing, suggesting people holding.

As is tradition

It does. Check this chart: [ During every peak you can see 6 months and less spiking.

on a high level, yes.

I take this as a very positive sign. Even with the price dropping more miners are coming online.
*EDIT- Correlation is 0.657, indicating a moderate positive correlation 
*EDIT 2 - correlation was 0.89 leading up to dec 31, 2017. Since then it’s -0.70. It will turn positive again at some point (for better or worse) but gap may very well grow due to mining becoming more efficient and cheaper

Good points, especially on electricity contracts. I hadn’t thought of that initially but it would totally make sense.

I’ll take a look at that, thanks.

UTXO's &gt;1 year old have increased by more than 10% since Dec. 2017 as well.

Thanks. I could go to 2010, but I'm not sure how relevant that would be. UTXO's &gt;1 year would be abysmally because of the time frame. I used Dec 2017 because it was peak bull market. Interesting to see how UTXO's have aged since then.

True that I could have started hash rate and price at the same spot, but all that would do is move the hash rate line up. Same thing if I made the price scale go up to 100,000,000. The condition would still hold, would just be harder to visualize because of how low it would be on the chart

I added UTXO age distribution since genesis block:

They’re both on a log scale which shows growth %, not absolute value.

Maybe you're thinking inverse head and shoulders?  head and shoulders is definitely a bearish signal.
