Can you show me where this has been "proven"?
It's certainly possible, but I haven't seen anyone "prove" it.

Yes. It's pretty transparent.

I think the reason you're posting all these messages about concern for the newbies is to build trust.
You could use that trust to scam everyone later. I'm not saying you will, just that you *could*.  
We really need to see some ID from you, to protect the newbies you might otherwise scam and scar.
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:45:00
No no, that would imply something improper for them.
The whole point of these "leaks" is to distance themselves from any improper behavior. They're all innocent, you see.  It was all Mark.
@_date: 2014-06-30 20:14:08
I'm curious if you expected that to work, or if it was more of a "Why not? Maybe I'll get lucky" bid.

Dodge!  Weave!  Bob!
Everything but provide a source for an idea you just made up.
@_date: 2014-03-01 20:20:35
From Gox itself, yes. 
But there's a lot of fallout yet to come, and that impact is as yet unknown. 
There's regulation, which is almost certainly going to come faster and be harsher in the wake of Gox. And there's the fact that tens (if not hundreds) of thousands of BTC believers have had their investments wiped out. Some percentage of them will not be returning. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:40:37
Why is important?
Answer- It's really not. 
Say it's someone trolling the sub. So what?  No, seriously, so what?
@_date: 2014-01-23 02:39:51
I'm acting obnoxious because you wanted to come here and pretend you had insider information.

Pretending you have information you don't to boost yourself up is as obnoxious as it gets.
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:38:19
So wait. Hold on here a second.
The Crisis Plan document was generated by a consultancy for Gox, according to the version of the story being pushed tonight by twobitidiot.
But the Crisis Plan document says 
"The reality is that MtGox can go bankrupt at any moment, and certainly deserves to as a company."
and 
"Try to reduce the impact and raise stakeholder conﬁdence, and eventually get Mark out."
Really?  This is something a consultancy would generate for the company and man that's paying them to generate it?
This isn't adding up.

Of course. Once I pointed out how foolish he looked to imply he knows anything because he works in the same building as a Google VP, he backed off of it. 
I've continued to hammer it because he tried to come here and act as if he had inside info based *entirely on the fact he works in the same building*  It was an obnoxious move for him to try to cloud the discussion here merely for the sake of his own ego, despite the fact that he has no idea what he's talking about.  
When I see that here, I jump all over it. I will continue to do so.

I'm getting a bit tired of the bitcoin devs saying "We could just centralize everything on top of bitcoin"
Sure, we could, but that kind of centralization is a bad idea for exactly the same reasons other kinds of centralization are.

By far the biggest news item of the day. Clears up all the FUD being spread by the wannabe China experts here.
@_date: 2014-01-13 01:33:49
My theory (and it's just a theory) is that a lot of the crowd here who keep being so negative about China are the little lemmings who sold too low in the first panic and then waited too long to buy back in.
Now they can't accept that they screwed up, so they keep insisting China is going to ban bitcoin and the price is going to drop even lower.
We'd all be better off if they'd just accept their loss.

Good.  I agree with everything he says.  Development *is* in fact too ad hoc, and the decisions are in the hands of far too few people.  The core devs are just people who happened to be around at the right time, they have no special insight into how things should be.  
You could see this coming last year.  In fact, I posted about it here.  Once BTC grows to a wider audience, a team more capable of looking at the needs of that wider audience is needed. BTC can't be limited to the hobby horses of a handful of people.
What's talked about in this article *WILL* happen.  The dev team will adapt or they will be forked into irrelevance.

Bitcoin is great. It's revolutionary.  But it will be supplanted with a "better" version long before it hit a million a coin.  Either technically better or politically better.
I can imagine it hitting $1000 per coin though. That seems pretty likely, actually.
I'm deeply suspicious of anyone who is seriously touting a million per coin.

Anyone who got a coin before I did.
@_date: 2013-12-23 10:36:14
Eh, it's not a small amount, but it's not a particularly big amount anymore either.  Around 160 btc at current rates.
Your best bet is probably just a normal exchange. Stamp or Gox.  Probably not BTC-e due to reported deposit issues, and frankly not enough depth.
Heck, if you're in the US contact Coinbase and see if they can do something for you other than their delayed buy for first time buyers.  I definitely wouldn't want to gamble on their delay right now.
But really, use one of the big exchanges and not worry about the hassle of a secure trade outside the exchanges.  It's not *that* much money for a btc purchase any more.

This MUST be automated if bitcoin is to gain acceptance. 
There's a number of ways it could be presented to the user, from details to "network down" or something similar.
But if the system relies on merchants making themselves aware of the state of the blockchain, they simply aren't going to use it.

What Technical Analysis is actually doing is attempting to quantify market psychology.  Find what people think (and will think) are floors and ceilings in the price.  A triangle on a graph indicates a narrowing range of acceptable prices for the market.  The market, as a group, is heading toward a consensus.  In that way, it's like statistical analysis in many other fields.
It's considerably better than astrology, though far from perfect.  The point is, it's definitely not an occult magical art.
It's more useful in bitcoin land than in many other markets because such a high percentage of the people who move the btc market use it.  So at the very least, TA gives you insight into what the people who move things think is going to happen.  It becomes almost self-fulfillling.
Then there's things like bots run by simple EMA algorithms, which I'm fairly convinced are largely responsible for the recent trend toward a mean. I think that's what the thread's OP is seeing as a "fishy event", actually.

Ugh.  Something needs to be done over there.  It's completely unacceptable.  They make enough money to have a decent system now.

Curious to see what happens when the blockchain is fixed and people can get bc into the exchanges again.

The idea of using Bitcoin for microtransaction tipping on forums is a "killer app" for BC.

Yeah, I was tempted til I thought about how many layers of risk there are involved.
It's still tempting, but the reward doesn't match the risk. 
Cash flow is nice, and if the risk were lower I wouldn't mind the low dividends.  But with the risk as high as it is, the dividends just aren't high enough to compensate.
@_date: 2013-05-06 12:50:10
There's an upward trend, but not hugely so.

There has been little correlation between the price of Asicminer shares and the usd/btc exchange rate.  During deep btc dips, Asicminer has tended to remain unchanged.
Having said that, there are a lot of newer investors since the last significant btc dip, so it may not always remain independent. Who knows if the new investors will behave in the same ways as the old ones?
An additional risk is that Asicminer operates in China, and there's always an outside chance the Chinese could shut it down overnight.  **Do not invest more than you are comfortable losing completely.**  It probably won't happen, but it might.
Lastly, ask yourself how much bigger Asicminer can get.  Is their explosive growth period behind them?   There is a hard limit on how much can be earned from mining, no matter how good you are.  Even if you're selling mining hardware, you're still constrained by that limit. There is a definite, indisputable cap on the growth they can make in their current business. What then?
Think carefully about the risk and rewards, don't get swept up in a mania.

Yeah, I wish the US attorneys good luck in shutting down accounts/exchanges in China and Russia.
Bitcoin is decentralized. Because of this, I believe it will survive no matter what government action is taken.
Could it be made illegitimate in western nations?  Certainly. But the west isn't all there is to the world.
Ultimately the US removing itself from cryptocurrencies is suicidal.

@_date: 2013-05-09 14:17:35
Not only can an "outside" group write their own, it's good for Bitcoin that people do it. 
Diversity in the ecosystem provides protection against bugs that creep into any particular implementation.  
Competition in the ecosystem also means more features faster, and reduces the reliance of the community on any particular set of developers.  It helps decentralize authority away from a handful of devs.

It's like saying PayPal can't send money to exchanges.  So what?

Busted, bro.

BTCT did little to none of this.

How's that value holding up?

Everyone has a theory.
Mine is that a trap would work a lot better during a period when people traded, not during the very predictable and consistent daily lull.

I don't think you talk to many American people about their banks.

Your're welcome to start your own subreddit. It's very easy to do.

I wonder if it was the guy who dumped a couple thousand BTC this this afternoon.
If so, then raising the price a few bucks netted him an extra few thousand dollars.

You're seeing why a real solution is needed. Good.

He's pretty clearly talking out of his ass.  I doubt he has any official backing.
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:30:58
No, I don't.
What I so see is that you're unclear on the concept of a free market.

ASICMiner seems to be planning to auction off some of their rigs.  It seems they can make them faster than they can find places to put them.

So if a municipality uses your software, will bitcoin automatically be an option for payment?  Or does the municipality have to approve it individually?
@_date: 2013-12-18 05:31:43
I prefer that translation.

Sounds like ASICminer.  I think they said they had 6 TH/S
EDIT - ASICminer plans on 60 TH/S by the end of April.
"By early April the next batch of finished devices will be available for deploying. At that time we will have a full team for installing and maintainance. If we get the 60TH/s online (conservative) in late April, and the hashrate of the full network from that time is 200TH/s which linearly increases to 1,000TH/s in late December. (200+1000)/2 = 600. So we will have 10% in average of the full network from late April to late December. That translates to about 88,000 Bitcoins total mined."
Yeah, it's them.  See here-

The new bunch is most economists from what I've read.

They're awful at managing resources.  For heaven's sake, just hire some people.

More likely- everyone who sold under $118 realizes it's not going any lower, and desperately tries to buy their way back in.

It's actually been up quite substantially from average weekend volume for them, though it's still small by Gox standards.

Please.  Reddit's expert sinologists told us all the statement was awful, awful news.
And if you can't believe random people on the Reddit when it comes to Chinese law, who can you trust?
