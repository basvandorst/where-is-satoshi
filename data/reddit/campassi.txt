My objective point of view is you're being a bit dramatic.  Any transaction with a fee included of $0.25 will easily get included in next block.
The normal backlog is almost always above 1000 trans, even on slow days.  Current blocks being pumped out are using less than half of the block cap.
Just as euphoria calls the top I predict euphoria calls the bottom.  And the euphoria here is misguided.  Screeching to a halt, that's a joke right..

US Dollars are backed by debt, and more importantly, the most powerful military in recorded history.  They are a necessity in order to pay taxes in the United States.  They are a necessity in many parts of the world to trade oil.
Bitcoin has no such backing or influence.  It is backed by nothing and has no alternative uses at present time.  In some ways this is an advantage, but the disadvantage yields massive price volatility that is unlikely to end until these fundamentals change.

The problem isn't having miners shut down, the problem is having all miners run by cooperating entities who change the protocol on the fly -- this is Bitcoin's flaw, and this is the flaw that will cause it to A) Fail, or B) Become the Orwellian nightmare currency of the world

You own a private key about as much as Metallica owns their yet-to-be-released music. It's information, a representation of something you can never own.
With gold, only God can change the rules of ownership. With Bitcoin, you need roughly 10 guys in China.

It can't stay at this price, the technology will collapse or go higher due to the profit mechanisms behind mining.
@_date: 2015-02-26 00:52:41
Since bitcoins are a binary investment: it will either go to zero or have a market cap of trillions: what is the point in going beyond, say, 5 bitcoins?  With such a high risk/reward ratio it only makes sense to collect a low number of them.  Thoughts?
@_date: 2015-02-08 02:05:07
While Peter does make mistakes in his opposition of Bitcoin, many of his correct points are alarming.  Recommend anyone to take a look at both sides of the argument 
I've used Bitcoin for a long time, and am fascinated with the technology, but it has serious problems without simple solutions.
A properly decentralized Bitcoin could never compete with VISA.  Off-chain transactions defeat the very purpose of a decentralized currency.
@_date: 2015-02-07 20:34:03
Curious if it will end up like the first dogecoin "halvening".
The upcoming Litecoin halving will be a great indicator.
Even more curious is who will process transactions after al the miners have to shut down.

I believe the price has everything to do with the protocol, if the protocol is to be used as a currency, by humans.
From a technical perspective, Bitcoin is simply beautiful in many ways, which is why it's been a hobby of mine for many years.  But when combined with a human society, it is broken.
The price cannot be stable, because there is nothing to base the price on, or derive value from.  Proponents claim that price stability will be reached in time.  It's been 6 years and the price has gotten *less* stable (see the charts).
The mining network is undeniably becoming more centralized, which defeats the very purpose of the protocol.  It's not possible for hobbyists to profitably mine at home any longer.  Which leads into the next point.
If the price doesn't rise, the protocol will fail because there will be no miners to process transactions.  This will become especially apparent when there are no block rewards.
I once thought, due to mining, there was a hard bottom in price somehow that could never be breached.  This idea has been shattered by recent history.
In the future I suggest attacking the argument, not the person behind the argument.

Peter Schiff lets people dump their Bitcoins on his site as well, and he thinks the proposal that Bitcoin could be money is insane.
Jim does seem to look at Bitcoin in a more favorable light though.
@_date: 2015-02-07 19:11:22
He makes some fantastic points in his debate with Stefan Molyneux.  Bitcoin is not the pixie-dust perfect fairytale that makes it out to be.  In my opinion the protocol is broken, perhaps this price reduction will bring on real innovation to fix the protocol instead of more get rich quick moon kids.
@_date: 2015-02-13 15:01:38


The problem is Bitcoin becomes more centralized every day.  As a long-time enthusiast I wish obsession with *get-rich-quick* would morph into *fix-the-protocol*.  While the network appears to be pixie-dust and rainbows for the time being it's not going to last.
@_date: 2015-02-07 14:47:28


Bitcoin will inevitably become fully centralized, as it has continually done for 6 years.  And the cycle would repeat.
However, Bitcoin is so broken this scenario will never play out.
@_date: 2015-02-01 02:40:05
If Bitcoin "goes big", (i.e. everyone gets rich!), holding 1 coin vs. 10 coins, for example, won't elicit much in the form of financial gains, since the result of this experiment is likely binary.  Therefore, "going down with the ship", is nothing short of insane.

Bitcoin isn't money at all, and in fact, by design, it can never be money.
It *may* be usable as some form of currency *in* *the* *future*, currently Bitcoin does not properly function as a currency, but it will never be money.
