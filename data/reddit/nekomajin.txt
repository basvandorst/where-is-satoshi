If we have the option to restore a patient's health, what reason do we have not to? We are already trying to do this today by tackling Alzheimer's or cancer. It's about living, not living longer.

Do you believe that "us" vs. "them" is also true in the context of health?

A vote for SENS is a vote for health, please support research to end age-related decline and disease!

I can agree with you that we have more than one problem in the world, but other problems need solutions in their own right.

I believe he was taking your argument to its logical conclusion - if you deny someone of therapies, you deny them the right to continue living. That's just my understanding, though, so please correct me. Why do you believe it's bad to support this research?

We care for people no matter what age, thank you for doing this!

Hi Dean, the questions were relayed and answered in another thread - he's a reputable scientist and has the publications to back it up. The maintenance approach SENS is undertaking can help us finally end the diseases of aging (Alzheimer's, stroke, cardiovascular disease, cancer etc). It's underfunded because there is a misconception about aging as being separate from the diseases that follow. It's gaining traction, and people are beginning to listen, but this is delaying progress and taking lives from us. Thanks for setting an example this Christmas!

Please give SENS a chance. This is going to have the biggest impact on the health of everyone.

The people spearheading this are baby boomers. If you want therapies for the millennials too, you have to contribute. What confuses me is the "us" vs. "them" - that doesn't exist. We're all suffering from age-related decline. Some of us are experiencing more of it today than others, I'm sure you have people you care for who are significantly older.

We might have different views on the baby boomers, but the problem of aging persists over time. It has affected previous generations, affects our current, and will continue over the next. I do think we have a moral obligation to try our best to save lives if technologies can be developed to do so.
