The hardware wallet never exposes its private key to anything but the trusted display though ? As trusted as the end-user software can be it'd be pointless to have a hardware wallet if it were to just pass its private keys to it. What a hardware wallet does (or at least is supposed to do) is SIGN the transaction.

It's not just that, people think that increasing demand/making mining only cards/whatev can be made with the flippin of a switch. No it's months of planning and work and by the time these kinds of efforts bring more gpus to the market the demand will probably have died out.

lol you wish, if bitcoins were all to get sold their "value" would collapse. So would any asset or currency.
