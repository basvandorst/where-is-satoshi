Set your own sell target. If it didn't hit, then hodl.  I do dollar cost averaging to accumulate Bitcoin, then when it's on the up and up I have multiple high range sell targets to sell off 10% at a time. I don't think I'll ever sell it all.

Yes but in the very early stages. People still arent talking about it whatsoever, let this slow continuous climb run its course, create the data to create proof to look back on for the next year or so, then the fomo will set. Hard. And we will all know it. When thats the feeling you get, it doesnt matter the price, sell.

I love stacking up data points in relevance to BTC, so I like this post, but my first thought is that this overlay should be on a logarithmic scale. The peaks and patterns over the last several "moons" match up much better that way. 
This moon should be around 80-120k, and crash to \~30k. (Given the pattern is the same, obviously nobody knows). This chart implies the same peak and drop as 2017
TL;DR - [
