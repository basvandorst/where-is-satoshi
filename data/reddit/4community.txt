0 Kama, redditor for 25 days. 
Is this your 10's of happy customers ?

Don't invest more than you can comfortably afford to lose




It is still one big experiment. I believe digital decentralized peer to peer currencies are here to stay, but bitcoin could be replaced just as were MySpace, ICQ, altavista, Sega, Lotus123.

This works if you are coming from a USA IP, for me to get this working I connected via TunnelBear (free). Without tunnelbear I don't have a bitcoin option to pay.

There is nothing in your post history or account history that is believable. ALL of your supporters on reddit are &lt;1 day old, 0 karma throw away accounts. The sites you mention don't even sell prepaid vouchers unlike say iTunes / Office 365. 
For all we know you could have carded the logins, sell the the same login to multiple people, or have obtained them from IRC where they definitely  were carded and will be banned.

Suggest you check the post history (due diligence) before trusting a new service provider with your BTC and the post history of any positive feedback.

Your bitcointalk account is only 21 days old, has 3 posts in the same thread, with no customer testimonials. 
Your domain was also registered less than a month ago with the contact number +1.123456789
Edit : Looks like OP has been deleted. 
It basically said "quick, the first 10 buyers get their purchase for freeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!"
In fact OP has now deleted all of their posts !

I paid for my order 8 hours ago and have not received any payment confirmation of my order. I also emailed support, and have not heard back yet.

In September/October I bought 14 Jupiter/Saturn KnC day1 preorders from half a dozen bitcointalk forum members who's real names I do not know, from various countries and time zones, using an escrow user on bitcointalk I have never met, hosted in a EU datacentre I have never been to.
Yesterday I sold off my remaining 5TH KnC farm that I have never seen, that are in a country I have never been to, to a person who's name I did not ask, all in bitcoin.
