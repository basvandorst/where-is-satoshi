I actually think(/hope), that was what Peter W meant. That he didn't want to force people to use Bitcoin Core, but let them join and run the implementation that they agreed with the principles of. To let Bitcoin Core be the result of the core dev oligarchy's stance instead of having it be reflecting the whole Bitcoin community. 
So if you disagree with Bitcoin Core cut the apron strings and support another implementation.

100% + 222% = 322%
322*0.1 = 32.2%
222% - 32.2% = **189.8%** ≈ **190%**
100% + 200% = 300%
300%*0.1 = 30%
200% - 30% = **170%**

I have been travelling now for 6 months. Almost all of my fellow backpackers that I introduce to Bitcoin seem interested and really want to know more. Quite a few are seriously considering buying into this world - some because of price speculation and others because they really like the idea behind it. I sent one guy a few fragments of BTC and he bought me a vodka drink. He is also pretty excited to see the latest price increase of the bitcoins in his wallet!

Lower fees on micro payments.
And if you are set up in a Lightning Network channel then you can be sure it is safe. With onchain-transactions you can only be reasonably sure (magnitudes more sure with 1 instead of 0 confs).
From my understanding you can already use FSS-RBF today to unstick a stuck transaction - 
I have heard that you need Full RBF for Lightning Networks to work properly, which in my eyes would be the only reasonable argument for implementing opt-in (full) RBF into Core. Can anyone elaborate on that?
@_date: 2016-01-06 08:48:36
Bitcoin makes the distinction between a payment network and a settlement network obsolete. Why can't it be both? I don't buy that mining will get a lot more centralized and the node count will drop dramatically if we raise the block size MAX limit to for example 2 MB this year and then exponential growth from there every two years. 
Are you against the use of Bitcoin as a payment network or do you really think it is game over for Bitcoin if it keep the properties of being one? I think Lightning Networks willl make a lot of the micro payments go offchain, but I don't think you should make Bitcoin a centrally planned network with a human controlled economic policy tool in the form of the block size limit.

That's exactly the same setup I have..
A small tip: Instead of using a usb-stick for moving between hot and cold computer, you can download the Electrum App if you have an Android phone. Then you can just use QR-codes for the transaction transfer and broadcasting - really easy and no risk from the usb-stick.
Also, I use a TAILS DVD in stead of booting from a USB - more secure..

In my point of view it's more like:
1. Bitcoin as a settlement ground layer and fast, scalable payment networks on top.
2. On-chain payment network (digital cash).
With things like the Lightning Network I am beginning to think that the first option is preferable. But no matter what, we need to increase the max block size limit - if a good flex cap option exists, that would be the ideal.

On the other hand, if there is no space for your daily cash transactions in the blockchain, then it is not digital cash. But I agree with your point and fear about the network getting too centralised - that's why I think we should move the transactions, that you don't need to have a proof of, off-chain.

Great summary! I would also like to add that it also featured an easy to understand explanation of the blockchain so even a non-technical average Joe could follow the logic - they explained it with the help of transparent boxes stacked on top of each other.. The host also got inspired by Roger Ver in the Dutch documentary - he fueled a paper wallet with one whole bitcoin and showed the private key at the end of the episode. The same TV show actually did another episode on Bitcoin in October 2013.

What are the arguments for even having a block size limit - are they technical, economical or both? I see the user "grau" coming with some pretty vague [arguments]( in the thread. That the block size limit is there for the miners competing for block space - and that if there was no limit the fees would drop to zero and the network collapse.
Eventually we would need to raise the limit every time the block size would be near the limit or have a built-in limit-raising mechanism over time. Why not just get rid of the limit, let the miners set the rules for which transactions they want to include? As I understand there are a bunch of other mechanisms for avoiding the block sizes getting "too big".
@_date: 2015-02-15 16:49:48
Bitcoin doesn't censor - it is permissionless and open to everyone no matter of their belief. People can actually interact with each other all around the world without a third party sneaking in between - that is powerful!

Electrum is included in TAILS - you can just burn it onto a DVD and boot it from there. Write down the seed on paper for your newly created wallet and copy the Master Public Key in a text file to a USB-stick so you can open a watch-only wallet from your internet connected computer and send the BTC to the right address.
@_date: 2015-02-05 15:01:58
But would we not need to raise the limit anyway if the block size got too close to the limit for Bitcoin to be able to reach its full potential. I understand that we could use side chains for transactions in stead - but the blockchain has never hit its limit in the past, so even with the limit we have now nobody has in large scale on purpose created huge blocks.
So the logic is that large miners wouldn't have a economical disadvantage for bloating the blockchain because they could just include there own transactions for no cost?
