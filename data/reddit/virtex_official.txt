That's correct, too many people commiting fraud with Interac deposits.    We are constantly exploring new ways for faster funding.  Any ideas, feel free to share them here or email marketing

Correct, you fund the card from CAD in your virtex account.  
What you're talking about (Debit from BTC balance) is theoretically possible, but this is a necessary first step.

Exactly right,  thought not a bitcoin card, this will provide the fastest exit of fiat from any exchange.

Yes, its on the Interac network,  you can use it exactly as you'd use any other debit card.   Any POS terminal. Groceries, gas, you name it.   Withdraw cash from any ATM. Big 5 banks or  convenience stores.

No,  this is strickly a debit card.    Other payment card options are currently being explored.

Dividend update was provided on Oct 1. 
from CEO Joseph David : "There will be no dividend payout this quarter for the following reasons:
1) New banking relationships recently secured demand large capital reserves in order for them to work with us.
2) VirtEx is re-investing all revenues to grow our company and maintain our team of 15 employees, as well as investing in marketing and legal counsel.
I do intend on paying a dividend once the company shows sustained growth and profitability, and will be providing the next dividend update as well as financials by Q1 2014
