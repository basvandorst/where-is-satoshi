I am in the same camp as your friends, and the CB insurance was a main reason I selected them early on. I was using the vault but truly not sure what its doing for me except preventing from going on a spree.

oy vey so dumb, I did a more complete search on my secondary email and it was buried down there. That's what I get for doing the transfer while sick at my mother in laws house on christmas day.
And as usual I realize this 30 mins after posting a question about it.
I am looking into Trezor right now tho, considering all the bad news I hear about coinbase. I'm holding long term but do want the fleibility to make day trades on a whim.

Do you feel it will be necessary for a vast simplification of the investment process? I dont see my Mom walking around with Trezor in her pocket and there's still so much paranoia in forums like this and the BTC press in general regarding the major exchanges and wallet services.
Perhaps BTC will end up managed by the same brokers who trade your blue chips?

Thanks, I actually resolved the issue I think. Will know in 2 days when completed.

I use Coinbase and have some interest in Trezor, mostly I'm concerned about a really good phishing scam not a hack or CB theft. So how easy is it to transfer between Trezor and CB, does it take long? Can you screw it up? I see they partner with Mycellium but I'm not inclined to leave CB.
**If you're going to tell me how terrible CB is please don't bother, I've heard enough already and made up my mind.

I signed up for GDAX but haven't used it, stopped buying in November at $750. The ACH delay I am already familiar with through my business so I have no problem with that. But the price swings and the fee structure in the buying process is frustrating. The biggest issue I found was I made a spreadsheet to figure out the median price of all my coin, I did this from the buy history I got in the phone app and just manually entered everything. Then a few weeks ago I ran a full report for my accountant from CB's website and then found the actual price with fees any swing during the purchase process. I will stick with them, I appreciate the rational responses on here. So much nonsense I sift through daily.
Re. Gdax, this may be for another thread but what do you like better? Do you still store everything on CB?
