When miners assemble a block, they are free to include whatever transactions they wish. They usually include as many as possible up to the maximum block size since ignoring low fee transactions simply leaves those fees for the finder of the next block. 
They then prioritize the transactions that pay the most fees per kilobyte of data. This confirms higher-fee transactions before lower-fee transactions. So If blocks become full on a regular basis, users who pay a fee that's too small will have to wait longer and longer for their transactions to confirm.

A federated sidechain has a weaker security model, but as far as scaling goes, it can perform better. The federation can be made of professional super nodes and increase the gas limit. Users' full nodes will struggle though.

If you get lied to by omission, it means you don't see a payment you received. This is very different from seeing a payment that you didn't actually receive (as you won't complete the trade and instead, if your counter party insist they sent the payment, you just check again what went wrong). It also requires quite a complex network attack to surround you with evil nodes. And finally, if you wait for more confirmations, the attack becomes fairly impossible. 
Now compare that to trusting an API of what you call a block-explorer node: It can feed you with transactions that didn't really happen, it doesn't need to mess with the network topology and even waiting for more confirmations won't help - as your source for confirmations is the same, potentially evil or hacked API.
Connecting to several such APIs might help a bit, but that is less elegant and much less secure.

SPV wallets are not at the mercy of the nodes they connect to. They connect to arbitrary full nodes and download the block headers. They verify that the headers are chained correctly and that the difficulty is sufficient. They then request the nodes only for transactions made to their addresses. Those transactions arrive together with a Merkle branch that proves they are included in the block. So the nodes you connect to cannot fake transactions. 
But while SPV clients don't need to trust the nodes, they do need to trust miners as they can't validate the transactions themselves, but only the fact that they are included in the block. A miner trying to attack an SPV client this way will lose the 25 btc block reward (as full-nodes will reject that block) and might pay some social price, but such an attack can be profitable. Of course, waiting for more confirmations makes such attack very expansive and practically impossible.

Shouldn't it be "In the past 4 hours, at least **48** blocks were found"?
@_date: 2015-12-30 10:09:22
Relevant part:


around more efficient block relay.  There is a collection of proposals,
some stemming from a p2pool-inspired informal sketch of mine and some
independently invented, called "weak blocks", "thin blocks" or "soft
blocks".  These proposals build on top of efficient relay techniques
(like the relay network protocol or IBLT) and move virtually all the
transmission time of a block to before the block is found, eliminating
size from the orphan race calculation. We already desperately need this
at the current block sizes. These have not yet been implemented, but
fortunately the path appears clear. I've seen at least one more or less
complete specification, and I expect to see things running using this in a
few months. This tool will remove propagation latency from being a problem
in the absence of strategic behavior by miners.
As for your concern regarding "undefined or poorly defined concepts" - being part of the plan doesn't mean it's being committed and released before everything is clear and tested. It means it's a good, uncontroversial and relatively well understood idea which is worth planing for.
@_date: 2015-12-29 18:38:01
A better title could be "Subchains diverts significant part of transactions fees from orphaned blocks to actual hash power". Enough with the personal shit.
In any case, weak-blocks are part of the plan. Like other additions it may mitigate some of the current risks related to big blocks.
@_date: 2015-12-30 11:33:57


But what if we can't yet? There's are well understood ~30% (not 51%) attacks that benefit greatly from withholding big blocks. Weak blocks cant mitigate that as the attacker won't publish its partial solution and instead can fill its blocks with whatever data which is new to the rest of the network.

Its funny to bash any scaling improvement because it's not ready yet or too complicated or basically because it's not BIP 101, while writing yet another personal attack saying we can rise the block-size due to something that doesn't exist yet. This is nonsensical even if the security claim was correct.

Great post. It was mentioned but not stressed enough - another great sidechain category is decentralized applications - exchanges, markets, storage, mesh networks, stock exchange, financial instruments, DAOs, contracts, games, bets, gambling, crowed funding and any decentralized application which require value transfer. 
Some early attempts  are already working and many are under development. So far they solved the value-transfer problem either with an altcoin or using a hacky and limiting integration to the bitcoin blockchain. 
Projects like counterparty, ethereum, openbazzar, mastercoin, storj, madesafe,  namecoin, bitshares, NXT and probably also the different anonymous coins - could all be implemented as sidechains with bitcoin as their native currency. 
Bitcoin the blockchain is a real limitation for such applications, but Bitcoin the currency with it's marketcap, liquidity, services, infrastructure and network effect is crucial to their success.

Actually, it was Vitalic that answered the claims in the article you linked to:


I was involved in the colored coins project for a few months before I moved to my position that MSC/XCP-style systems are strictly superior to CC in basically every possible way (and moved to Ethereum full-time, but I will say that Ethereum is not superior to CC in every possible way because it is not directly based on Bitcoin so doesn't have as nice interoperability properties, though with cross-chain SPV proofs you can get halfway there (and the independent blockchain approach has other benefits, like faster block times, no risk of LukeJr censoring you and the eventual goal of proof of stake; you weigh the costs and benefits)). But I spent enough time in colored coins to understand the dynamics involved here.


























In fact, I would argue that everyone saying "Bitcoin for everything is the way to go!" is suffering from the exact same "moral hazard" in the opposite direction.

Oh, just a simple hardfork? Please just read through the answers. XCP is required for technical reasons, no one is harforking bitcoin to add counterpary functionality to the protocol and sidechains are not yet a reality. Once they will be, the devs said they will be happy to become one. btw, don't think sidechains will be free, Blockstream just raised 25M. They'll find a business model.
@_date: 2014-05-14 18:42:43
They are all protocols working on top of Bitcoin's blockchain to allow the creation of user-defined assets and provide an exchange where those assets can be traded. More advanced features include paying dividends to asset holders, broadcasting data feeds which can be used for bets and derivatives market and allow pegging and leveraging real world Indices. 
CounterParty is by quite far the most advanced to date. The dividends and betting features are already implemented and an impressing web wallet was released. Its native asset XCP (used for bets) was created with proof-of-burn which means no IPO fund for developers.
MasterCoin is doing the exact same thing and was there first, but in terms of development was left behind. Unlike CounterParty, the native asset MSC was created in exchange for 4700 BTC which are now controlled by Mastercoin Foundation and used for development and PR. Some believe that MasterCoin's funding advantage will allow them to close the gap.
ColoredCoins are also doing a similar thing, but with no native asset, an approach some consider more fair and straightforward. In terms of features and progress its behind the others.
While those features can be implemented with Bitcoin alone by extending the protocol, it's no likely to happen any time soon.  
@_date: 2014-11-22 11:19:09

Many wrong observations in the post, but I want to focus on the claim in bold which I totally agree with:


Who are those other teams? What have they developed lately? How well they understand the weaknesses and potential attacks? What sort of governance will they implement? 
Increasing the block size (carefully, not BIP 101) is indeed less of an issue then handing the keys to some benevolent dictator.
The aggressive personal attacks against the core devs won't change the minds of many of us who are following their public record for years. These are talented, hard working people who care greatly about bitcoin. If other teams want to take over, lets see more coding and less nasty attacks. Those have already caused a lot of damage.

This is the interesting part - selfish mining is only profitable for very big miners. The first part of the article deals with that "profit threshold" (and finds it is actually safer then previously assumed).
But, when adding propagation delays to the model, the profit threshold disappears, so any attacker, not only big miners, can benefits from some form of dishonest mining.
Big mining operations usually don't risk dishonest strategies as they have a reputation to keep and a long term interest in Bitcoin's success. That is not necessarily the case with small, anonymous miners.

I think "transaction replacement" is quite different from "Transactions That Can Be Fee-Boosted". It might be a good idea to change that part. Even in the longer description of the feature, there's no mention to the fact that outputs can be changed as well. 
Not saying anything's wrong with Opt-in full-RBF, but it feels like the post on core's site is making a clumsy effort to go around the 'full' part, gives the feature a strange name and generaly comes across a bit guilty and manipulative .

What if Diamond is not a corrupt agent but was actually acting on behalf of some agency?

^ This is the interesting part of the piece. It's just sad how everything is now about "block size" and how Bitcoin's best thinkers and doers are ignored, if not attacked, in the attempt of the 'business community' to take over the reference code.

Moore's Law is just a forecast not a physical or natural law. It was already adjusted in 1977, 10 years after it was born, to doubling every two years instead of every year. Gordon E. Moore himself says he is surprised to see how long it holds. Intel confirmed in 2015 that the pace of advancement has slowed. 
In short, hard coding such a projection into a decentralized protocol might be unsafe.

Concerned? Cashless society is the best thing that can happen for Bitcoin. It will practically become the only cash available.

I imagine, not moving Satoshi's coins publicly, was a requirement.

Avoid Coinbase
@_date: 2017-05-06 19:26:05


I disagree. Are you suggesting moving around huge amounts, giving away their estimated hashrate and who knows what else? Makes more sense not to touch those coins.
@_date: 2017-05-19 16:24:25
Man, if you think pasting some fliers is crossing the line, you really have no clue what political protest is, and I doubt you understand what Bitcoin is about. Bitcoin will be attacked in many ways and we will probably need to protect it not just on reddit. 
It's perfectly ok to be in it for the money and not care about the "debate", but stupid to be so opinionated about something you don't even bother to study.
@_date: 2016-05-15 17:04:26
Control? If anything, it protects miners against patent trolls. No one will block open source optimizations. Still, bitcoin can't fork according to patent fillings, so unless it's a wide generic solution, it doesn't make much sense.

First, it's not. Chinese exchanges are in trouble since months, volume is down and Bitcoin is traded at a discount.
But even if it was China, why do think American demand is more real?
@_date: 2016-05-25 07:07:22
So exchange  (by volume) adds Ethereum?  Bitfinex and Kraken, both bigger than Coinbase, did it before. They also have Litecon for some time now..
It's only natural for exchanges to add coins, they are in the business of exchanging them. But this ex-goldman guy and his arrogant, ungrateful CEO can't just add a coin, but need to pull a Hearn and actively try to hurt bitcoin. 
Let's not forget Coinbase. Many of us are bitcoin experts in our communities, often pointing friends and colleges to exchanges. Let's remember to point them elsewhere.

According to Gavin he has the key from block  According to Matonis, block  as well. Lets start with these two.

That's the problem of users keeping fiat and bitcoin balances with the exchange. Members of the Liquid union won't lose any coins. Each party can always withdraw his current pegged btc balance back to Bitcoin main.

Yes we've seen it here some years ago, it will look familiar yet again when price drops from 12K to 10K.
@_date: 2016-05-25 08:40:04
Maybe you should. Let's help them focus on Ethereum only, they caused enough damage for bitcoin, they do not deserve our buisiness.

That is not correct, it was temporary and is already removed

If you move coinbase coins whenever you mine a block and then move them all between wallets whenever the Satoshi treasure changes hands - you give away quite a lot of information, estimated hashpower included. Remember, there weren't too many miners in 2009 nor any privacy tech.

What if transaction fees add up to 100 btc per block in a year or so?

Can't see how its technically done without NYT implementing something on their side.

Take it easy with Gox, it's the 10th time this thread... You still have many bridges to cross and only time will tell if you can do better. Mocking your competition doesn't gain you points.

Accountability on both sides is only needed because they use an outdated, insecure payment system.  The issue is not eBay or Paypal, its the payment technology they use - namely, credit / debit cards. A credit card is like a user name without a password. Any waiter you give your card to, any website you ever paid to - have all they need to steal your money. Such absurd technology sure requires serious  "security standards". Bitcoin has it built in.

Banks and regulators are on the same side and are the same thing. They are enemies to most of us - socialists, libertarians and others. Bitcoin is a powerful tool in this war. We all want to see the current system go down but it doesn't mean we agree on the alternative.

Great Idea.
I'm not sure how to avoid a third party server. The rest is a classic facebook app. it can be nicely done with facebook's [Open Graph]( They call it "an API for telling stories". You define Objects and they relate through Actions. So in our case the objects are users and coins and the actions are send / receive.
If your friend Joe just sent or received funds, your feed will show "Joe has just received 2.5 BTC from Sara" this is how it gets viral.
Here is another good requirement: it should be possible to send btc to facebook users that didn't yet add the app, similar to Paypal's "send money to mail". Again, i cant see how it can be done without a managed server but when it comes to decentralization we have all the experts right here.
@_date: 2013-03-31 09:12:33
You then miss all the viral benefits of being properly integrated to Facebook.

Most Bitcoin merchant solutions offer payouts in local currency for a reasonable fee, so this seems to be a solved problem.
From Bitpay site: "Merchants can receive a settlement in their local currency with a guaranteed exchange rate, or keep the bitcoins, or choose a percentage split." 
 
Coinbase, Walletbit and others have a similar offer.
