(setting your well-deserved inferiority complex aside) ... So you'd be okay with the increased costs outside the US if we leveled out the prices so they're equal in every country?   I'd certainly be okay with that.
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:46:27
Drugs cost more in the US because we're mostly paying for the R&amp;D of drug companies that the rest of the world benefits from.  (Ok, even if the extra money isn't all spent on R&amp;D, the fact remains we're subsidizing the rest of the world with the cost disparity.)  
Ironically, the rest of the world criticizes this generosity by snarkily pointing out this price disparity, ignoring the obvious fact that most Americans would welcome the change if the drug companies leveled our prices with the prices around the world, and the rest of the world  (including those very people doing the snarking) would not welcome their price increase.

Gold's value doesn't come from the fact that it's a great conductor.  IOW, gold isn't really backed by anything either, its price is set by supply vs demand, same as bitcoin.
As a store of wealth, bitcoin is already competing with gold, but Cramer's right it will probably never completely replace gold.  I'd expect gold prices to fall as bitcoin reduces the demand for gold, however.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:58:20

Unnecessarily coupling morality with currency is just as foolish as coupling religion with politics.
The blockchain provides both a means and a method for value exchange, it's amoral (outside of enforcing its own security).  If you're expecting it to magically impose a uniform wealth distribution on society, you will be disappointed I guarantee it.  What kind of cross-eyed droolathon got you there to begin with, anyway?
BTW, I find it fairly depressing that somehow our school system has chunked out so many people who feel that wealth *should* be uniformly distributed.  Chasing that ridiculous fantasy only creates misery for all but the select few in the politburo, which will likely NOT include you.

Okay, so he's running a false dichotomy where either bitcoin exists or money does, but not both.  Seems very unrealistic.  Who is talking about banning the dollar?


Oh, so now it takes an apocalyptic event to make bitcoin valuable.  Seems even more unrealistic.


Not sure this follows.  He's basically arguing that the more buying power you think you'll have in the future, the least likely you are to spend in the present.  I disagree.  I think that people who tend to think they're set up just fine for the future don't mind spending more now.


He totally misses that bitcoin is infinitely divisible.  Fractions, buddy.  4th grade.


I don't follow this point.  If, when prices fall, shrinking the supply of currency causes goods to be unaffordable, wouldn't you want to NOT do that?  


What part of the existence of bitcoin keeps government from regulating the money supply?  He just argued that bitcoin has a fixed supply, wouldn't the continued regulation of the supply of government fiat allow them to pursue that Keynesian pipe dream?


That's ridiculous.  This is only applicable if government budgeting and spending is performed in bitcoin.... is there anyone who truly thinks that's realistic?  I don't.


The existence of bitcoin has no effect on this.  Borrowing is borrowing.




Again, where did he get the idea that the existence of bitcoin prevents government from lending to banks?  They can still lend just as much fiat as they like, as much as they always have.

Uh, no.  People trade in all kinds of things that aren't currency.  Is there "official support" for the price of gold, or of pork bellies?  No.  One could argue that at least with pork bellies, you own something *tangible*.  Well ya, but just like bitcoin, your perception of its value is based on your expectation that someone else is going to want to buy it from you at some point.
People keep making that argument as though people actually prefer to store their wealth in dollars because dollars are "officially supported".  Nope, they don't want the inflation hit.  Securities and commodities are where a lot of people go with it, and those things aren't backed by some horse shit about "full faith and credit of the US govt" either.
The author is a backwards thinker who can't see the value of the separation of coin and state.  Bitcoin is a *global* currency, no government *should* be able to set "policy" for it or to singlehandedly inflate it via printing coinage (which amounts to a flat tax).  It's only jingoistic arrogance that presumes that *any* global currency should be under the thumb of the Federal Reserve.  The fact that the US government can't fuck you over with it should place the currency in *more* demand, not less.  You don't have to trust *anyone* to use Bitcoin, it's designed that way.

True enough but -- with respect -- IMO that's a petty reason for disallowing the devs to do whatever they need to order to make LN great, breaking changes and all.  It's just not that big of a downside vs. having to gimp up LN permanently (or wasting time on some migration path).
