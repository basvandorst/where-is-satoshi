Can you expand on that?

You have to back out the number of transactions associated with speculating on the currency, as those don't represent BTC or ETH adding value.  Bitcoininfo is not at all indicative of investment value.

Emphasis on crypto, why BTC particularly.
AOL might as well be dead.

What blood? Bitcoin is up substantially from this time last year.

Are you suggesting if they found out it was a new species the price of tulip bulbs never would have dropped. 
The underlying tech doesn't need to be fradulent for BTC to lose 99% of it's value. See AOL.

Oops, I thought you were the person I was talking to.
That being said, I have no interest spending time looking up sources to convince you that Munger is probably right about bitcoin if the probability that you would accept it was zero.  Even if it was readily apparent that Munger had a crystal ball.

If you're going to be this disciplined why not be buying the world stock market instead, like VHGEX.
If you think businesses will probably make money in the future, then at least your diversified among all the sectors, all the industries, and all the countries.

It hasn't even hit previous all time high. It's despair when the typical hodler gives up and sells. Otherwise it's just trading.

If the purpose of investing is to make social change I suggest donation instead.  
If the purpose of investing is to receive an adequate return on the principle invested, without high risk of permanent impairment of the invested principle I think it makes more sense to invest in all of the publicly traded businesses in the world.  
I do not object to hedging some of your portfolio with bitcoin, but it  just strikes me as a missed opportunity.  But, I suppose if you can't motivate yourself on that basis, and it isn't interrupting your regular retirement savings, I'm overstepping here.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:11:26
That's not the problem, because you were only *in* long enough to make the transaction. You see this strawman version over and over. It never convinces anybody. 
The problem is long term contracts can't be made in a volatile currency.  How do you get a mortgage denominated in Bitcoin? How do you plan a budget for a salary that's fixed in Bitcoin. **That** is the obstacle to adoption as a general currency.

If you believe in bitcoin why isn't that a good thing. Net accumulators want a low price net sellers want a high price.

People said the same thing when Munger and Buffet said the same thing about fraud during the internet bubble. 
People said the same thing when Munger and Buffet said the same thing about derivatives in advance if the housing market crash.
The two of them have a *very* long, *very* good, track record. You aren't obligated to take their advice. You are obligated to take it seriously.

Dude.  It's not hard to see that you just read about Japan's lost decade or something, and thought that the nGDP numbers were all you had to look at.  Here's some data that expands on my point:
[A plot of Real GDP per Capita](
[Another plot of Real GDP per Capita](
[The relative performance of the US undergoing inflation and Japan undergoing deflation, per working age adult](
What's going on in Japan is weird, but it can't be honestly blamed on deflation, and standards of living aren't crashing, they're doing roughly the same as the US on a per worker basis.  If you for some reason decide to use nominal numbers, and decide to forget that Japan's working age population is shrinking, then I guess you can claim deflation has done this??
You'd have to believe that deflation caused the Japanese to have fewer kids, you'd also have to believe that deflation went back in time and caused one of the largest asset bubbles in world history.  But, on the upside you'd get to call me a buffoon, and who needs causality when you have sick burns like that?

Right, **but** some very rare people are relatively more likely to be right than wrong. One of those people is Charlie Munger.
I'd happily take a bet on whether I will be paid in Bitcoin in the next 30 years. If you think I'm wrong let's head over to long bets. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:27:55
Bet you that milk hits $10 before I get paid a salary in BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:12:55
Japan has been fighting deflation for years.
 They have a high standard of living and low unemployment. Who cares about deflation?  Just because there *was* deflation during the great depression doesn't make it the *same* as a great depression. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:45:00
A salary that is exchanged to bitcoin but quoted in USD, or a salary that is quoted in BTC and does not adjust regardless of the USD/BTC exchange rate?
Grassfed milk is currently $10 / gallon in some places in the country.  
Currently the national average is roughly $3.50 per gallon.  Historical inflation has been 4%, so I guess I expect to collect somewhere between here and 26 years from now.  I don't suppose you'd register a longbet?
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:14:44
Yes.

I'll agree to dig up the quotations if you agree to change your mind?

Would you want your mortgage to be in Bitcoin?

Most Americans didn't buy a NASDAQ index fund either.

They specified they didn't understand internet technology. They *did* understand it would lead to a big mess.
They specified that they didn't think *anyone* understood the derivatives.  Charlie Munger said, "To say that derivative accounting is a sewer is an insult to sewage".  They *did* understand that it would lead to a big mess.
I wonder why you think Munger *not* having read Nakamoto's whitepaper is an obstacle to him calling this correctly?
After all, "that old guy doesn't understand the new paradigm", is *literally* the argument that was leveled against Munger and Buffett in each of these cases.  Your lack of awareness about this borders on dangerous.
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:14:47
Munger very regularly changes his way of thinking and documents it. He can just identify speculative excess *better than you*. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:25:38
Well, Buffet doesn't own a smartphone and doesn't understand the technology, but they've decided to buy a bunch of apple. These two understand human psychology, very, *very*, well. 
Three or four times Munger has come out and said, "this won't end well". The internet bubble, the financial industry's use of derivatives in advance of the housing market crash, and now, about Bitcoin. 
Maybe this is it, this is the time he'll be wrong. But *every single time* the bull argument has been that the old fart doesn't understand the new paradigm. If you're going to go up against Munger, that particular argument has had a very bad track record.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:32:12
Unless of course you agreed to a 4BTC per year salary in December. Too bad the next time we look at your contract isn't until next December.  Good luck paying your bills.

The largest bubble in recent memory, the Japanese stock market took a little more than a decade to fully inflate. It then collapsed over the course of 20 to 30 years. 
Bitcoin isn't a bubble only if it becomes a currency.  If price continuing to go up meant something was not a bubble, it would disqualify all bubbles.
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:16:11
Does he understand the internet?
Did he correctly call the internet bubble?
Does he understand Bitcoin?
Can he identify a speculative mania from a mile away?
*Everyone* thinks their mania is different. The price action on Bitcoin over the last 3-5 years has far more to do with speculation than technology, and on that count I have no doubt that munger is far more of an expert.
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:46:45
Nah, if bitcoin goes down you'll just blame banks and FUD. There is approximately a 0% chance you'll admit you were wrong.
On the other hand I'll give in on BTC when I start getting my paycheck quoted in BTC rather than USD.
