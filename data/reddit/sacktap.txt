Having more parties involved decreases collusion, especially when they are politically/geographically distributed. 
From what I understand, the operators of the mining pools today are quite close. Collusion is easy.
If China, India, US, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South America etc. each owned an equal sized mining pool I would feel much safer than the cartel we have today.

Why should miners be pooled up?

Though in a way it kinda feels like switching from Wal-mart to Target

There's always a cost.. opportunity cost.
You're not supporting the big pools simply because you like them. You support them because it makes you money. Leaving the mining pool is lost income, is it not?

The crypto currency community is full of people making wild claims about the relative centralization of various projects. Calling something centralized is like calling someone racist; it starts to lose all meaning unless you are extremely careful in how you define it. Decentralization has become a kind of religion, when in reality it is merely a tactic to deal with certain kinds of corruption and attacks. Today I would like to document how I measure decentralization of various crypto projects. (direct quote)
