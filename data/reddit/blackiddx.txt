Crony capitalism is fascism, not socialism.

I'm talking about anarcho-syndicalism or libertarian socialism. I mean left in the contemporary way.

Ya know not everyone on the left sucks the government's dick. Some of us are libertarians.

Libertarianism is a garbage ideology for incel retards who don't realize they're trading one shit version of coercion i.e. "government on behalf of the governed" for another, i.e. "unrestrained capital on behalf of the free market". One can at least attempt to be wrangled and domineered for the common good, while the other is an amoral vacuumous black hole demanding perpetual growth or risk systemic collapse. There's also the myth of the free market, or at least the myth of version you dorks idolize there's no such thing. How one would think that modern day technology and medicine would exist outside the pressures and incentives of a government is just... confusing, to say the least.

My family is about to lose our farm because of medical debt but thank you big government for "picking up the tab," you fucking moron, you don't know shit about shit.

Insurance is using collective pools of yours and other peoples money to pay for your things. It's the entire concept behind insurance. And taxes.
