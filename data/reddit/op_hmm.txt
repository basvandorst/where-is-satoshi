Have users pay a few cents more for the miners fee. They typically process transaction in order of the mining fee paid :) Hope this helps

It sounds like hedging would be good. If a company tries to cashout of their btc on a weekly/monthly basis, hedging would prevent any losses(and potential gains) in price change.
Edit: word

awesome, thanks :)

I upvoted you. But people on here are so intent on clinging on to the old companies, instead of choosing innovators. All they say is "get incumbant company xyz to accept bitcoins"
Fuck that.

No. I keep telling folks, bitcoin price depends on the DEMAND. There is not much demand lately. How to raise the demand for bitcoins? Simple. Innovation.
1) Post alternatives to sites that dont accept bitcoin and dont offer a DEEP discount, if they do. Because bitcoin is a merchants best friend, more than the consumer.
2)Offer services, solutions that are currently unavailable.
3) stop trying to pursuade companies to adapt. Dont wait for them.  Prove to them by creating a competing service that accepts bitcoin.

Yeah, they are probably sharing your personal info with nsa, fbi, cia, fhp, etc.
Yeah, they are probably selling that info to third parties.
Yeah, they might have some questionable staff members who might steal your id.
Until i began my hoarding, i used campbx.com. You have to go through dwolla, however.
