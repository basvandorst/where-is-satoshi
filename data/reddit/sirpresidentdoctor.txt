Yeah sorry still not talking about random people, also you accept verge, gtfo

No, the real answer is you have to call your bank to loosen fraud restrictions any time you make a transaction that isnt in your normal shopping range or isnt a normal type of transaction you make.
Because people are stupid and lose their card information all the time and the bank has to fight to get those funds back. Its for your protection.

They also owe you interest on that, so I would call everyday until they do.

This is not how its treated, I've traded and done taxes on forex for over 10 years.
You can make 10,000 trades but you're only taxed on the profit you've made at the end of the year, you arent taxed on and intended to cite every single trade you make. That's ridiculous.

To be fair, wire transfers are different and CAN take between 7-10 business days, which is why ripple (the platform not their currency) is actually pretty cool. Since I work at a bank I saw the potential in xrp back before the big boom($0.17- $3.00), when they said they would be using the currency as a middleman, and made a few grand of that.

This is also false, you can dispute charges by calling the bank, for almost any transaction even one you agreed to through a "free trial scam"
I work at a bank homie, we all love crypto here, I promise.

Sorry I was referring to important people like stores who accept btc, not random people.

It's not hard to use your money though, go to the bank and make a cash withdrawal, spend it how you like. But when the bank has to fix the fuckups dumbasses make and lose their money over it, they're going to make sure to prevent as much fraus as possible.
I never thought I'd see the day where people complain about someone having their back.
But God forbid you have to ����reply to a text���� or ��call the ����bank�� and���� talk ��with someone�� for�� 5 minutes so������ that ��your ��sketchy ��ass���� transaction���� can go through.
Cry some more, every bank does this, if you dont like it then ask for your direct deposit in cash and dont use banks.

The letters are coming from the IRS not coinbase

It's not about tax evasion it's about how broken the tax law is.
Crypto currencies are currencies not property. Every purchase or sale of crypto should not be a taxable event it should be treated as any other currency in that you pay on your capital gains.

This is a really bad metaphor

Its literally your last post, it's old but it's still your last post
@_date: 2019-07-19 03:41:43
Yeah I work at a bank, an ACH should never take more than 3-5 business days
@_date: 2019-07-15 03:12:37
Yeah you're actually just super annoying, most people dont care if you switch banks, and there isnt anything they can do about their fraud prevention, other than temporarily disable it so you can make transactions. The reason it works now is because the fraud systems learn from how you shop and loosen restrictions based on that. 
The bank usually doesnt even use their own fraud system, most use Visas fruad system bc it's already established. 
And lastly your bank isnt telling you how you can and cant spend your money, they're protecting you from people trying to commit fraud with your information, because THEY have to get the funds back from the merchant or from the fdic which is a hassle for them. All to make the customer happy, and here you are being a whiny entitled little bitch about  them trying to protect your funds.
Congrats you're an ass.

It took 2 seconds if me accidentally clicking on your name to see your last post
@_date: 2019-11-12 14:57:47
No, because it actually works as a payment method
@_date: 2019-11-11 22:31:43
Shitty people but bch is still better��‍♂️
@_date: 2019-11-12 18:06:05
Yeah using the money you have is totes boring, I'd rather sit and bag hold while not using it, and wait hours or days if I want to spend it then chance losing it to the lightning network.
