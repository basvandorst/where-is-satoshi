Oh boy. I gotta go think of some cool gadget I want for my computer.

What happens to the bitcoins if only 1 of 3 sign the transaction (e.g. Bob signs the transaction but never upholds his end of the deal)? Are the bitcoins gone from Alice's wallet for good?

I think Dread Pirate Roberts, then pen name of the guy who ~~started Silk Road.~~ (Disregard that. I suck cocks. Just remembered that the current DPR inherited the position)

I want to be sure how this works, so can you tell me if my understanding below is right?
Using the example of Bob, Alice, and a trusted third party who we'll call Carol, Alice sets up an escrow transaction where she sends her bitcoins somewhere else such that neither her, Bob, nor Carol are able to touch the bitcoins. Once Bob completes his work, Bob approves the escrow transaction and waits for either Alice or Carol to approve as well.
Let's say that Alice is a total jerk and refuses to approve the transaction (her reputation be damned!). In this case, Bob can call on Carol as the third party to approve the transaction, which means the 2 of 3 escrow transaction is approved. Now this is the part that I feel very hazy about: once the escrow transaction is approved, how do the bitcoins move to Bob's wallet?
The page says that one of them submits a redemption request for moving the bitcoins to someone's wallet, but what exactly is a redemption request, and what does it look like to create a redemption request? I'm imagining it as a method to move the bitcoins that are stuck "in limbo" to someone else's wallet, but in this case couldn't Alice (being the total jerk) create a redemption request to move the bitcoins back into her wallet? Do all 3 people have to approve the redemption request, or are only 2 needed?
Also, what happens to the bitcoins if only 1 of 3 approve the escrow transaction (and the other 2 decline the transaction)?

Where and when do you work? If you're close by (South Bay Area), I might drop by for a visit.

I'm guessing it's because of the part that says


It's sort of like saying, "If you don't watch what you say carefully, I'll bring out an army to quash you." Even if the anonymous asker doesn't actually do this, it places pressure on the person who has to answer the question. It forces them to have second thoughts about what they say, and what they end up saying will not accurately reflect their thoughts. Whoever has to answer will be wondering, "Oh god, I hope what I say doesn't make people think I'm a really bad person or an idiot." It's a shaming tactic.

I like this billboard. It gets more attention than the billboard for a local strip club (which happens to include free barbecue lunches for patrons).

Oh, this is really cool. I didn't know there was a site like this to tell me where places accepted Bitcoin.
I'll pay attention to these places so I can shop there sometime.

All right. That satisfies my curiosity. Thanks a lot!

Yes, having to fill out a bunch of forms for my personal info is exactly what's stopping me from buying bitcoins online. I'm planning on meeting a local seller to buy some in-person with cash instead.
I loaded up a prepaid card with some money, hoping that I could use the prepaid card to buy bitcoins online instead. Poor research actually tells me that buying with a card is a bit more complicated. I'll stick to buying in-person.

I've got a whole mBTC. I gotta keep this shit safe. Time to install some booby traps.
