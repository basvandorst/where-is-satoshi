If you don't agree with how a website conducts business don't visit them. Right now any website with ads cost visitors cap under your argument. Reddit even has ads. If you choose to visit a website you have to accept the resources it uses.

I been investing since I was 12 with a guardian account(so i'm a little above average when it comes to knowing about investments), and to me when I learned about bitcoin it didn't seem like an investment to me since there are no fundamentals to base it on. 
However my eyes are wide open now. I don't look at it how I would look at a stock or an income property. I look at it based on the potential. It has huge potential to be a world changing technology.

but who's to judge what's fine and what's not? in the end its up to the user to choose to visit the website. if they are unhappy with the practices that are deployed on the website they don't have to visit. websites need revenue too.

The comments on the CNBC website are dreadful. I feel like more education on bitcoin/digital currency must be needed for the public so that they can see it for what it really is.
I too had my doubts 3 years ago but the more I learned the more I realized this is the future and fiat is old, slow, and inconvenient.

He was actually on CNBC that day. The memo was vague at the time.
