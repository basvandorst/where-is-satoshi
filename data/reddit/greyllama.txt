Seriously. I watched my parents go from having 0 issues with their assets, to wondering if they can afford the next month's bills over the course of 8 years.
In Western BC Canada, hydro-electricity has soared, housing has soared, gas is getting more and more expensive. 
You ask the newer generation if they feel secure with their money, while another generation is still using yesterday's economics to rake in personal wealth while trying to convince everyone how "lazy, and entitled" millenials are. 
I am under 18, have a minimum wage job with &lt;20 hours a week (only got the job through family, no one else wanted to hire me) and applying for scholarships, bursaries and any financial aid. I am attempting to save up for college, all for the day I can throw it all into debt and maybe save myself a couple months of grounging for cash. With the school and program I have chosen, I will go approximately $27k into student loan debt for a four year program, on top of housing.

The program in question is a combined major of business and computer science, I doubt you care much but I appreciated your input. 
With some savings from me and my parents (which I am very grateful for) it comes to about 27k in debt, which coincidentally is average.

The title is literally the captions spliced into one.

Pretty much the point I was trying to convey, but kids like to be rewarded with something they enjoy. What would have bought with the paper money? A lot of things, but if he decides on a specific use for that money that is appropriate, I don't see the problem. It becomes irrelevant when we talk about the parents, some parents squirrel money for their kids, some give their kids allowance to buy whatever they want, some do both.
Racist? What's racist? I'm talking about kids, sure my point of view isn't shared by every person in the world, but this has nothing to do with the colour of your skin.

If the child wanted to save money, I am sure he could ask his parents to save it for them or put it in a bank account. A child is a great consumer as well, they will spend it towards their interests (eg. candy, but in this case music and game currency.)
I loved candy as a kid and still do, but I bought it with money that I got from allowance. I didn't save it, my brain wasn't fond of the concept of saving until a certain age, when you realise the world is more than just candy, games and toy cars.

What about those "invisible walls" that were eventually surpassed in earlier years, such as 2012? Were you saying the same thing back then?

I wish you luck friend, whether you buy out at 350 or mostly stay in for the long run. You may have luck this week with the current trend.
