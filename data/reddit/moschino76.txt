Basic financial analyses suggests that it is a bubble, which doesn't mean that we cant make tons of money with it.

How about working hard, managing the risk and being careful. This is how. Plus we help each other in our community. Trust me - coming from a 100% Jew.

Sounds like we have a bunch of investors here.

NPR....lol. Right. Can this be any worse?

Such a "smart" thing to say.

I like Jewbase and JooDAX more
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:10:46
I agree. People are fucking dumb. This is not a religious bunch of woo-woo shit that nobody can explain but faith. "Us" sticking together will not provide jack shit to secure your  extremely highly speculative asset.

Can you please stop polluting reddit with this nonsense?

Why are we talking about racism?

Any poll that compares radio (NPR) and cable news (FOX) is a non-credible and dead on arrival. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:14:20
This is awesome! LOL.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:37:12
Concept of bitcoin should be synonymous with decentralization and freedom and not with some weird compatibility with nonsensical religious dogmas. This is what drives smart people away.
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:46:49
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:43:48
I agree - its not worth $17000!!! You can justify the price of Bitcoin in four main ways:
1) Transaction Medium - not there
2) Remittances - not there
3) Microtransactions - Not even usable
4) Digital Gold - ???

Number one cable news channel with MOST people watching it. Its like being annoyed being advertised during Superbowl. I hope you're as far from marketing as possible.

NEVER give ANY money to ANY RELIGIOUS causes. Religion is a prime reason for all the problem of humanity.

If this is what we are counting for as far as bitcoin future - I'm selling ALL today.

I'd like to know how you measure discipline and determination with IQ test. Discipline is a key quality to be VERY successful in cryptocurrency market. Smart don't mean shit. Most "smart" people are broke.

Sounds like a poll done by CNN.

For a Jewish person, this is not FUN and far from a FACT. Its preposterous.

The Sony CDP-101 is the world's first commercially released compact disc player. The system was launched in Japan on October 1, 1982 at a list price of 168,000 yen (approx US$730) - its completely pointless now, because we have cloud and streaming tech. In 20 years we will not need to hold bitcoin. It will be part of everyday life.

This is fine! Really - who cares what those "financial image consultants" think. Those old, greedy bankers like Jamie Dimon are pathetic technology haters.

When I cannot sell or buy, it may as well be down. The site didn't work yesterday at the key moment when I needed.

I think in BTC case we can safely triple the traditional 10% correction to 30%.

I think we already went to the moon even though some people don't believe it.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:16:43
My projection for next 4-6 months:
1. Dip to $6500 before New Year - lots of people will get in at this price, daytime investors.
2. Correction around $3000-$4000 range - institutional investors will start buying at this price point.
3. BTC will hit 10K in late January 2018.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:18:18
I firmly believe in evolution of block-chain technology and higher adoption and utilization rates by all people who are 18 to 40. This number will grow each day. And speaking of prevailing economic regime...when its big enough, they will work with you. Bitcoin and ALL block-chain have a bright future.
