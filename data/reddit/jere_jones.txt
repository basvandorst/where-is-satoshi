Where do you see $140?

Short answer: no
Long answer: Since Bitcoin is designed to consider the longest blockchain as "the truth", someone with 51% of the network power could always keep his version of "the truth" longer than everyone else's until it becomes accepted.  Also, the reality is that this could be done with less than 51%.

Can someone check my math?
Assuming that:
* outside the bitcoin world, a 10% annual return is pretty good
* weekly dividends average out to .01 BTC/share
Means that:
* one share returns .52 BTC/year (.01 * 52)
* one share should be worth 5.2 BTC (.52 / .1)
Does that sound right?

Never ever, *ever*, sign random-looking strings.  The string should have some non-random part of them.  Signing " 2013-10-01 11:57:34 Let me in! a;lkds580dhg-0" is much better.
Remember that standard bitcoin transactions are made by signing with your private key.  I don't know if it would be possible to generate a random-looking string that when signed would be a valid transaction, but the possibility concerns me.  What you're signing could be anything from anywhere.
Imagine a day when there are multiple sites around the internet that allow you to log in via "signing".  Imagine that just one of these sites is compromised.  That compromised site could feed you the random string from another non-compromised site (classic man in the middle attack).  Since there is no recognizable information in it, you sign it without worry.  If the string you're signing had the website's name in it, you could at least be sure a MITM wasn't happening.
Imagine a day when contracts are signed via PKI.  That random string could be the hash of a contract you've never seen.
Avoid any and all of this by not signing random-looking strings.
I find it hard to believe that no one has mentioned this before.

I don't understand the phrase "who wants to do accounting at".  I understand the point about 50 uBTC being larger than a penny, but not the accounting part.
These dust transactions have always been unfeasible to use.  This patch doesn't change that.  It just makes it so that they aren't relayed as prolifically.  And it certainly doesn't change the math or the resolution of the math.

If you click on the $ quantity, it should change to BTC.  The number of BTC in your blockchain wallet isn't changing.  It is the instantaneous value of the BTC in USD that is changing.  If you bought 2.5 BTC and the current price of BTC is $70, then you should see $175.  If the price of a BTC on MtGox goes down to $60 then it will show $150.  If the price of a BTC on MtGox goes up to $80 then it will show $200.
The amount of BTC you have hasn't changed.  Just it's value relative to USD.  That's what your seeing.
Currently the price is doing a slight decline so you are watching your USD "hemorrhage".  If the price was doing a slight increase then you'd watch your money increase.
It all comes down to the ups and downs of the market.

It would be a completely new pool.  I wouldn't plan on transferring any accounts or taking responsibility for any coins owed by the current MtRed.
That said, you do bring up a good point about people who aren't paying attention connecting to a new pool at the same domain.
I shall think on that.
Regarding whether you can trust me with the new pool... *I* would trust me.  My history is pretty open book.  I use the same username everywhere and it is even my real name... kinda.

Slight correction/clarification: Nodes and miners will not relay or accept transactions that contain any outputs less than 54.3 uBTC.

People lose money all the time. The price is up and down a lot lately although there has been a general upward trend over the last year or so. 
Wait or spend now? If you wait, you will *probably* spend less BTC to get the same value in USD. But it isn't a certainty. 
Bottom line: the price goes up and down. Spend it when you feel comfortable.

I'm not sure of the details, but you provide one half of a token pair that they use while generating the address.  The address's private key can only be determined using the half of the token that you key.

* Green line sloping toward the upper left (from bottom center) == price increasing

* Green line all over the place == lots of price volatility

My understanding is (was) that "fold" means double or half depending on the direction.  Kinda like folding or unfolding a piece of paper.  If you fold something in half 10 times it isn't 10 times smaller, it is 1024 times.
That said, your links cause me to doubt myself.  Thanks for the citations.

If you are running a service that is doing this then all you need to do is make sure you send your transaction to a miner that will accept it.
There are pools that advertise they accept transactions with lower or no fees.  I'm sure there will be pools that will accept dust transactions.
Add that pool's bitcoind address as a peer to your bitcoind and stop worrying.

It also isn't a real problem for regular users.  When was the last time you sent 50 uBTC to someone?

The other replies are valid and good but I think they may have missed, or not emphasized, that 'sign message' allows you to prove you own the private key to an address without transferring any BTC.
Similarly, 'verify message' lets you verify that someone has the private key to an address.
Imagine a scenario where you would say "Oh yeah? Prove to me that you have 1 million BTC!"  That person could sign a short message with an address containing 1 million BTC using the 'sign message' function.

It's worth noting that when ASICMiner distributed dividends today, they left over 200btc behind.  Normally they only leave a few btc behind (I suspect that is due to rounding).  That leads me to believe that friedcat will return the 200btc if someone can prove ownership.

I would disagree with that idea because most people new to Bitcoin will find but probably won't find a secondary subreddit. Also, these types of threads are great places to learn even for experienced users. They aren't likely to surf a "noob" subreddit. 
Just my 2 satoshies... 
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:53:17
Good thinking.  The problem would be so called double spends.  While the service is holding the transaction, the customer that created the transaction could create another transaction spending the outputs used as inputs for the held transaction.
Then when the service pushes the transaction to the network, it would be rejected because the inputs had already been spent.
Edit: Nevermind, I thought you were saying the service would hold on to the transaction and not push it to the network until the complaint period had passed.

Don't have them sign a random string.  A random string can represent anything.  Instead have them sign something that makes sense like "username - timestamp".
That isn't so much to protect you but to protect your clients.
General rule of thumb for anyone: Never sign anything you don't understand.  Don't sign it with a pen.  Don't sign it with a private key.

A random string of characters could be a hash of a contract.  Or it could be someone's public key.  Signing it with your private key could be considered agreeing to the contract or endorsing that person's key (think web of trust).
Your solution of having them sign "Authenticating for session xxx at blah.com" would absolutely remove that possibility and sounds like a good plan.
Go forth and do great things!

Referring them to the FAQ or Wiki is great in theory, my understanding from though, is that it doesn't work and the Monday thread gives anyone a place to ask questions that may be considered "dumb" without starting a lot of different threads.
