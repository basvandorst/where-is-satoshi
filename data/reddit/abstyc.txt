The only person or people who "founded" Bitcoin is Satoshi Nakamoto, and we know nothing about his/her/their political beliefs.
Oh, and the shit he sold was everything but "harmless".

Awesome to see real adoption! Clever to offer both BTC and LTC but use the BTC logo for brand recognition.
I'm always curious how these things pan out.

OP, if you *really* want to obtain some BTC by mining I'd suggest something like [NiceHash]( which automatically mines the most profitable altcoins and pays out in bitcoin. You'll still probably make negligible or slightly negative profit depending on your system and electricity costs but at least you'll get a dollar or two worth of bitcoin per day.

It's not a bit misleading, it's just plain wrong.

Holy shit! I go *one hour* without looking at my bitcoin price widget and this happens...

I'm not an investor or even have a background in finance so I'm talking out of my ass and you should probably disregard my opinion, but all of that drawing lines/triangles/tetrahedra on price charts and talking about "support lines" just sounds like reading tea leaves to me.

I'm hoping he means he peaced out of the community, not bitcoin as a whole.

I actually had a very similar issue - uploaded ID, said it was successful and even got the "ID verified" email but it still just sent me to verification if I tried to add a payment method.
Eventually figured out that there was a previous occasion where I'd started the ID upload process but abandoned it meaning there was a "failed" verification attempt that was blocking me from adding a payment method.
If you go to  do you see any "failed" verification attempts in there? If so you should be able to remove it. That fixed the issue instantly for me.

That's just showing you the Coinbase price.
There is no central, "correct" figure for the price of bitcoin, only the rates that people/exchanges are willing to sell them to you for which will of course vary.
Try [bittybot.co]( which will allow you to compare different sites.

Confusion like this is exactly why we have the concept of block *weight*.

You're overestimating the influence of Western politics IMO.

"Ownership" of BTC is really just *knowledge* of something - the private key associated with an address that holds a balance. It's not possible to differentiate between "lost" BTC to which nobody holds the private key anymore, and BTC in long-term storage. 
What you're thinking of is impossible, not just technically but conceptually.

1) That's not what people mean when they talk about permissionlessness. And sure, anyone can fork, but these forks are actually attracting miners switching over.
2) The price keeps rising because of speculation, not actual adoption, which is the point of the poster you're replying to.
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:38:23
If you put it like that you made 0 BTC gains.

I wouldn't read too much into a 5-min chart. [Here]( the recovery since the recent bottom (1hr candles). Definitely a local dip but I'm not sure I'd call it a bulltrap yet.

I totally agree. I also think Roger is very very bad news and a very bad actor, but selling some fireworks online is the smallest of his sins.
Libertarian BTC supporters going after Roger for that is just hilariously hypocritical to me. There are so many things to criticize him for, and bringing up the "he's LITERALLY Bin Laden" thing just makes you look desparate. It's unnecessary.

I think it's already too late.

All of those things can be done with *much* cheaper (close to free compared to gold) metals. It's not primarily the utility that gives gold its value.


That's actually not true. You can use the blockchain to notarise things, for one.

Not sure you can call it a normal correction. This is being directly driven by China (edit: and JPMorgan) news.

I'm in Bitcoin for the long haul so selling isn't even entering my mind. I'm going to see how the news develops today and over the weekend and then probably buying in some more.

Uh, he wasn't just visiting, he was an exchange student so he was living there.
I can't imagine there are many first-world countries where it's easy or even feasible to live without a bank account issued in that country. At best, you're going to be wasting a lot of money on fees.

It's not really. Their CEO said it's a fraud. Would they allow their clients to buy into Ponzi schemes or Nigerian scams just because they asked them to?
