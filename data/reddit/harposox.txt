Yup. So even if they "enable" withdrawals, forced password reset means you can't even try to get your funds until Friday evening at the earliest. More stalling tactics.

Which is why they may fake it—for instance, put the site back up in "read-only" mode with facetious haircut account balances in place—but they absolutely will not open up withdrawals or trading again. Letting assets off the reservation while operating an insolvent business is a big no-no, legally.

Zane's being played by his bosses, just repeating what he's being told. Classic con behavior. Right now, they're just buying time. Next week there will be some excuse as to why trading/withdrawals can't be resumed... and then the lawyers get involved and nothing gets resolved for years. Kiss it all goodbye.
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:15:23
That's an interesting thought. Rather than socialization, merely freeze 36% of all assets across all accounts, then buy enough BTC off of the OTC market to reimburse hacked users' accounts to 64% of their pre-hack balance? Avoids any conveyance liability... not sure of the liability of "freezing" funds/assets, tho.

Decentralized architecture, like OpenBazaar?
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:33:31
Of course, but that's assuming withdrawals ever get re-activated. Big if at this point.
@_date: 2016-08-07 21:55:39
Think it through. They're not stupid enough to actually follow through on this asinine plan, they'd spend the rest of their waking lives getting hunted down by law enforcement/wrapped up in litigation. This 36% bullshit is just a stall tactic. It's all gone, folks. I imagine the site may get turned back on in "read only" mode as an additional stall tactic, but no way do they actually follow through on this "socialization" bullshit and re-open for trading/withdrawals. The crime's already been committed, and they still have plausible deniability—they're not going to risk piling on additional criminal liability. Inside job exit con. Bitfinex is dunzo.
@_date: 2016-08-07 22:50:10
Follow your own train of thought to its logical conclusion: If BFX knows that its socialization plan is a legal non-starter—which they must, unless they're total and complete idiots—then it's all smoke and mirrors. Stealing bitcoin is one thing, relatively easy to cover by a supposed "hack." But dipping into bank accounts to redistribute funds...that's an easily provable crime, with very little benefit to the perpetrators (who have no intent to keep the business afloat if this was indeed an exit scam). The silence of BFX's principals speaks volumes here: would you rely on a 23-year-old to handle PR during the biggest crisis in your business/brand's history?
I think they're buying time, actually HOPING for the first injunction/LE inquiry, so they can claim they tried to restart trading/withdrawals, but now it's "out of their hands."
I hope I'm wrong. But if withdrawals aren't activated within a few days... once the lawyers get involved, it's all over but the crying.

The "technical analysis as dog whistle" theory. Me likey.
@_date: 2014-06-30 16:46:13
Because they're serious about winning, and long term, they believe this is still a ridiculous bargain. These folks are loading up their investment trusts for the long haul, and overbidding not only shows their confidence in the long term success of bitcoin, it also nets them a ton of PR/exposure in the process. Plus once the winning bid leaks, it's likely to move the market in that direction fairly quickly. Pretty smart. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 03:27:29
Hadn't considered that much of a premium being a possibility, but it makes total sense. These are institutional investors who are loading up for the long haul, and they're undoubtedly savvy enough to understand that the price is going to reach *AT LEAST* 5-digits once mainstream adoption occurs. Paying $1,200/per coin is still a ridiculous bargain.
There's also a very real chance that a winning bid like this, once leaked to the public, causes a self-fulfilling rise in the price, increasing the value of their holdings and also permanently raising the price floor. These guys could be back to par in a matter of days/weeks.
@_date: 2015-01-14 03:14:49
That goes without saying, but I'm not so sure that kind of volatility is easy to predict accurately... unless you're controlling the price. That's another argument, IMO, that the mining industry will consolidate with a few of the bigger, market-making operations, and the rest will go busto.
@_date: 2015-01-14 02:37:20
You're right—very simple. The downside of this bubble is all about shaking out both weak handed traders AND poorly funded mining businesses. The smart, well funded operations have likely been sitting on their coins rather than selling so they'll have an easy time re-inflating the market once they've bankrupted the competition.
I suspect we'll see these depressed prices (sub-$200) for long enough to kill most of the mining competition, then: boom goes the rocket ship. The market makers are in it for the long haul and know EXACTLY what they're doing. Control the currency AND the means of production = absolute control over the market = magic money machine.
@_date: 2015-01-14 03:40:24
That's silly. You can't assume that the big operations' "math" is based on higher bitcoin prices, particularly if these are market-makers. They know the game, because they're driving the action.
Sitting on a pile of coins is far from worthless. It allows you to manipulate the market price.
Keep in mind, smart, adequately funded "big" operations aren't just mining for profit—they're also trading, and buying coins at market bottom. Imagine being able to throw a few million dollars at something like litecoin that can net you a 25x or 30x return if you correctly identify (or engineer) the proper entry and exit points... There's a stupid amount of money to be made with a sufficient amount of input capital and a basic understanding of the crypto economy. Those profits go to the big fish, not small ones.
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:26:56
Spot on, sir. This is a global game and the big players have the resources to relocate their operations to countries with the cheapest energy costs... no different than any other industry. Mining sweatshops FTW!
@_date: 2015-01-14 02:54:27
You guys are overlooking the obvious. Mining is going to consolidate with the biggest operations that have the financial backing to survive these price drops, and these are likely the same groups that have engineered the previous bubbles. If this is the case, they're sitting on massive piles of cash AND coins they've acquired. They are going to keep the price of entry (hash rate) as high as is necessary to smother any potential competition. And why not? If they can control both coin production and the market price, they'll have a virtual top-to-bottom monopoly on the entire industry. This is why I suspect we'll see repeated bubble cycles over the next few years... it's the easiest mechanism to make an insane return on investment and simultaneously weed out the competition.
@_date: 2015-01-14 06:13:55
Price bubble caused a mining bubble, no mystery there. Same kind of exponential overshoot you see in nature, other markets. But I guarantee the biggest mining operations are colluding to drive price, they'd be idiotic not to. Obviously relationships between these entities will change as the landscape of the industry changes, but it's absolutely in their best interest to coordinate their efforts, until they've cornered the market—then the game changes, as do their individual strategies.
@_date: 2015-01-15 05:15:17
It's simple: classic bubble overshoot. We're now near the end of the correction. Correction may overshoot to the downside, but this is normal in a volatile and illiquid market. Be patient, don't panic, things will recover.
@_date: 2015-01-14 02:57:16
Any minimally sensible mining operation already has that baked into their long term plans.

Problem is, bitcoin has been legally ruled "not money," so therefore doesn't necessarily qualify as free speech. Unless you're "laundering" it like Charlie Shem, of course, and then they'll just ignore this gaping technicality.
Bottom line is if you're in the Fed's crosshairs, things like legality and Constitutionality don't mean a damn thing. Federal prosecutors get their man 96% of the time for a reason—it ain't a level playing field.

Because this "correction" involves killing hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians, and leaves the Iraqi people in worse shape than they were under Hussein's rule, you dimwit.

You neglect to mention that this evil, awful dictator guy was also a U.S. puppet, until he went off the reservation. Killing hundreds of thousands of civilians in an effort to depose your own proxy dictator is the ultimate hypocrisy, and is utterly unjustifiable under any legal or moral standard.

Yeah, that little goody was in of their latest terms of service. In addition to selling their customers' data, they also run credit checks on their customers.
I'd suggest using Circle. So far my experience there's been drama free, and there's no charge for purchases made from a linked bank account.

Those aren't anecdotes. Those are examples of a level of institutional political, military, judicial, law enforcement, and economic corruption a country like Nigeria could only dream of achieving.
