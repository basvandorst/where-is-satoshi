The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now. You haven't failed to invest, you are deciding whether to invest now.
The others have left good advice on dollar cost averaging and investing what you can, without blowing your budget. I agree with all of that.
Don't feel guilty that you missed an opportunity because hindsight is ALWAYS 20/20 and the uncertainty in the present along with your financial situation at the time is a huge reason you didn't invest back then. That's okay.

Guys i don't understand what makes bitcoin so special still.
I really like the idea of a currency not tied to governments and fiat, but i don't see what can protect bitcoin from big money manipulating its price or governments unilaterally imposing restrictions on it a la the Bulgarian and Chinese governments. It doesn't exist in isolation and even if it's a disruptive technology with increasing support, what can protect it?
There are always calls to HODL when stuff like this happens, but is that really enough to keep it going?
I apologize if this post isn't very cohesive but it does reflect my uncertainty in bitcoin at this moment.

Unfortunately, no. Most of the people here on Reddit are unable to influence the voting constituencies that keep voting in the house and senate republicans. You can thank gerrymandering, the electoral college, and voter suppression as well for disproportionately raising the republican voters influence and securing their re election by their ardent supporters.
People don't circle jerk because they want to, they do because they feel powerless and frustrated with their lack of political options, including having no say over Ajit Pai and his damn net neutrality repeal.

Are you banking on litecoin to make back your losses from bitcoin? Because the prices don't change at the same rate. Litecoin may fall against bitcoin and you won't make as much as if you put it into bitcoin.
I'd say try your best not to panic sell. That lesson is more important than the answer to your question.

Unless you're a corporation, because corporations are people, in which case you are free to do whatever the fuck you want...

It will NOT force governments to become disciplined. You will see much of what happened with the gold standard decades ago if anything. The poor get screwed and there is no inflation to help them or their governments.
