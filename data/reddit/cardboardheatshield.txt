At this point bitcoin is still a legitimate threat to itself.  This is why the price fluctuates all the time.  But everyone in this subreddit claps their hands over their ears and starts screaming "LALALA I CANT HEEEAAAR YOOOOOUUU" every time that gets pointed out.
If you're heavily invested in bitcoin, and you didnt take the time to research the mechanism behind it and what a 51% attack is, well, then it's noone elses responsibility to 'let you know.'  The information is out there, and super-easily accesible.  What more do oyu want?  Should we put a bright, blinking red flag on every person who owns bitcoins homepage that says "Clearly you're too dumb to make a decision for yourself, so we're here to alert you that you should sell your bitcoins RIGHT NOW."
People who want to throw money into a pool so it can grow without them having to think about it is what a hedge fund is for.  That is not what bitcoin is for.

Of course Warren Buffet would advise against Bitcoin.  It is as far from his investment style as you can get.  Buffet invests in companies that perform a service at a profit.  Bitcoin is a store of wealth / currency / whatever you want to call it that one holds and which may increase in value over time.  Buffet has no interest in these things.

He said he is concerned about tax ramifications of accepting bitcoin.  That is a reasonable concern and it is up to him how he weighs that risk vs its potential reward.  The company made a decision.

Also, this is assuming that the other 50% of the hashrate is all processing exactly the same data, every single person.  With the amount of orphaned blocks that already happen, I think it's safe to assume this is not the case.  So really, the attack percentage could be slightly lower than 50%.

The most truly random numbers are seeded from cosmic ray strikes and radioactive background noise.  We're going to need a Geiger counter.  Number of events in the first 60 seconds is your column, number of events in the second 120 seconds is the row.  If N(events) &gt; N(Rows), then continue counting at Row 1.  e.g: N(events) = 63.  N(rows) = 10.  You would use Row 3.

A few weeks ago, I looked into bitcoin for the umpteenth time since 2009.  I got seriously, seriously mad at myself for not starting to mine coins when my RA told me about it in college in 2009.  I seem to remember being able to get something like 4 cents for an entire block of 50 at the time  and I was like, "This isn't even worth the time it would take to figure the program out, let alone buy new hardware for"
Decided there would never again be a better time to start than now, and found a bunch of wicked cheap block eruptors on ebay.   I know I'll never make my money back, even at half the going price on hardware, but hell, this is pretty fucking cool and I'm enjoying being a part of it right now and that's good enough for me.

"ponzi scheme"
People keep using that word..  I do not think it means what you think it means...  
A Ponzi scheme is where you take peoples money, and tell them you've invested it and it's earning interest.  You then spend the shit out of said persons money and take another persons money to "invest".  When person A wants their money back, you go "Oh fuck shit fuck it's gone" on the inside, but on the outside you say, "Okay, that will take three days to transact."  In those three days you borrow money from people C, D, and E to "invest".  You then pay back person A with C, D, and E's money.  
The USD is not a ponzi scheme.  When the government takes your money (taxes) there is no illusion that it is being invested and that you will earn a return on it.  It is understood that the taxes you pay will be spent, not invested for return.

Send them back a letter asking, simply, 'Why?'   Never have I found such a good question for pissing stupid people off, while offering more gracious people an opportunity to explain themselves, as "Why?"  You can also ask "What is the legal basis of you being allowed to shut down my account for spending my money where I choose?"  or "Is this some sort of legal issue?", because it makes the hairs stand up on the back of their neck in fear that you might have some knowledge of your rights and some expectation of them respecting your rights.  
I had this exact conversation with a realtor who is acting as an intermediary between me and my landlord a while ago.  You'd have thought I had insulted her mother and slapped her children.  "I'm going to need you to send one check instead of two from now on." (there are two of us on the lease)  "Why?  Is there some sort of legal thing I'm not aware of?"  
"Sir, I dont have time to sit here and explain to you why I need one check instead of two."  
Now that,  that pissed me off...  I have a 5 digit contract with you, and you dont have thirty seconds to answer a simple question?  Oh, hell no.  This will not stand.
"Oh really?  There are two names on the lease.  We are both adults with our own checking accounts.  Why would you expect one check instead of two?  If you needed a specific form of payment, then why didnt you specify that in our contract when we signed it?  Ma'am, with all due respect, I'm sending two checks..."

You need ASICS to mine profitably today.  The electric to run that GPU will break you, and even at that, AMD gpus are far more optimized to hashing algorithms than nvidia cards (I have no idea why.  I suspect the first guy to write the code to get his GPU to hash was an AMD guy and, simply, noone ever bothered to optimize for nvidia, but I really have no idea.)
Try mining litecoins with your GPU.  It uses a memory intensive hashing algorithm.  Since ASICs don't have memory, a whole new ASIC would have to be invented to mine LTC.  And that wont happen until (if ever) Litecoins become worth much more than they are today. 
In the meantime, keep an eye out on ebay for deals, and snatch them up when they come along.  I just recently got 25 block eruptors for $150.  Still never going to recoup that, but, my 10Gh/s is good enough for me at the moment.  
Also, frankly, I'd wait till the 28 nm chips get cheaper, unless you find a KILLER deal on the last gen asics.  28 nm features are only 2x todays standard, so they wont be nearly as easy to improve upon as the 100 nm asics were, and even still, the improvements wont be so much better that they leave you hanging in a cloud of dust when they do take off.

Yea, but think of how much an Mhash/sec was back then...  They would've mined a lot more than 250 coins.

Ive always been a fan of the Nth prime number, or the first digit from 20 random pages of "A Million Random Digits".  Or, you could do the first digit from page X, then the next 4 digits could be the column and row of the next digit which could be found on the page ennumerated in the very next couple digits...  
You get the picture.  There are a million different ways to come up with random numbers, and none of them are truly random.   I think it's interesting how we use cryptography to protect money that was generated through cryptography.  Kind of comes full circle, doesnt it?
Also, I really need to buy that book now...

It all boils down to whether or not you want Bitcoin to be a legitimate currency or a device for laundering money and working in the black market.  Bitcoin is coming out of the shadows now, and I think we need to do all we can to show people that it's a perfectly legitimate thing.

Here is one on ebay.  I dont really know how you power them, you need some sort of a PCB that they snap into (I never really was in the market for one to start, so I didnt bother to read up on them), but other than that, you set it up, plug it into the internet, and let it hash away.  
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:58:51
At first, I read your post as "No, cryptography was invented for bitcoin."  and I was like, uhhh..........
Aside from that, you're right. But you would still need a serious understanding of cryptography and statistics to put together the puzzle with existing technologies.
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:13:07
Ask yourself this, though, and answer honestly.  Who hires mathematicians specializing in cryptography?  Three industries:  Universities, Security, and Government.  And most of the ones teaching in universities used to crack codes for the government. 
I'm not the tinfoil hat type, and this may be all hype, but, it *does* kind of make sense to me.
Now, DARPA, IMF, all that, I doubt.  but the NSA and CIA?  Cryptography is such a huge part of what they do every day that it is entirely possible for them to have come up with this idea.  It could even be a non-US agency, who knows?  
More importantly, though, does it matter?

You'd still need the drawing and the machine time.  The only difference is that in a 3D printer, you're building it from the ground up, and in a CNC machine you're carving it out from the top down.

I honestly think you're crazy...  It's a block of aluminum stuck in a CNC machine and then lacquered.  The dimensions arent terribly critical.  The only difficult part is the drawing, which, I feel like you should be able to automate, but that may be more difficult than I give it credit.

I think it's because it was the second one to come out, and the only one to make any sort of actual improvement on the Bitcoin platform.  Verifications in 1/4 the time, hashing algorithm required more physical hardware, and 4x the total coins.  
I think they will settle in to be worth a good percentage of a bitcoin when all is said and done.  I dont mine enough of them to make it worth trading up at the moment, so I just hand onto them.  Although, like I said, I am looking into a new video card, but even still, it's only going to be a couple LTC a week.  I'll probably just hang onto them and see what happens.

There is this thing that exists that may be able to help you out here.  Granted, it's an ancient relic of the way civilization used to operate, but there are still some hanging around.  It's called a 'Store.'

You really need a rag wheel for a bench grinder and some buffing compound.  The wheel on the dremel will be gone in about 45 seconds.  (Might still work if you're only doing one piece, but you'll go through at least 2-3 wheels while doing it, and you still need the compound.)
I spent lots of time on an eagle project hunched over one polishing little brass name plates for the local veterans memorial.

I dont know about this.  Unless you count the half-penny as 5 mills. I dont know much about that tax token, but I wouldnt really consider it a currency, except in the most technical sense of the word, in the way that stamps are technically currency.  We should get a numismatic in here.... 
Edit:  Actually, reading up on it, these tokens were given by individual states, not the federal government, so stamps definitely have more right to be considered currency than these tokens.

My thing is, that if Bitcoin makes it, at least one or two other cryptocurrencies will, too.  Not to the extent of bitcoin, but you really cant have a brand new monetary system with only one currency.  You dont have just Gold, you have Gold, Silver, and Copper.  You dont have just Dollars, you have Dollars, Pounds, Euros, and Renminbi. 
Everyone is so caught up in making their investment back in a week, or two weeks.  No, this is for the long haul.  If this is as good as people claim it to be, even in spite of all the bubbles and whatnot, imagine where it will be in 40 years?  Surely Bitcoin isnt going to still be the only player.  Perhaps it would even be obsolete by then.
So, I've got my computer sitting at home hashing away at litecoins.  And, even if litecoins don't turn out, it was a good excuse to upgrade my graphics card ;)

At this stage bitcoin is condemned to burst again.  When something rises in value this meteorically, nobody in their right mind is going to be selling.  This creates a vicious cycle that makes the value rise even faster.  Untill one or two very large players decide it's time to sell out.  At that point, the value will dip, significantly.  On that dip, everyone who has simply been holding bitcoin to make money on it sells, too (because they're afraid of a mass selloff) and a mass selloff occurs, the bubble bursts, and values fall.  
I think the values will keep going up, on average, but I think there will be a couple more bubbles before things flatten out for good.

Really, it's not that hard to understand.
"I've got a project coming up.  It's going to be the next big thing, I swear!  You can buy into it right now for $10 a share, and trust me, you're going to want at least 300 shares. "
"This project has been up and running for three years, has shown consistant growth, has demonstrated significant promise, and has been proven as a solution to a problem that is real.  You can purchase our product at $1000 a piece, and there is real data to suggest that the price will continue to rise."

It's still going to be a somewhat diffuse reflection compared to the black laquor, so I think it'll be alright.  
And I borrowed my paps.  He was a machinist and has tons of equipment. He literally has at least one full sized metal lathe just chilling in the basement.
(I also may have used it to sharpen a wood chisel to a razor edge, caught the felt wheel with the chisel, took a big chunk out of the wheel, and sent the newly-razor-sharp chisel flying across the room at roughly 200 mph...   Maybe....  But we dont talk about that... but be careful because it can happen...)
Edit:  Also, that's not my work, just a random site I found about buffing things...  And also, a felt wheel may be better because the rag one can get into the indents and remove the lacquer.
