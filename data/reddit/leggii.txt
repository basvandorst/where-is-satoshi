Paging r/btc
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:31:07
From my experience of browsing both r/Bitcoin and r/btc I'd recommend doing your own research outside of these subs if you are planning on investing. 
The commenters on each sub have  vested interests that will only give biased views.

Unfortunately you paid for someone else's Lamborghini.

Sorry for your loss.
I think it's easy to forget how hard it is not to sell through such an insane rise in value, whether it be a crypto or a stock or whatever. How many people, who aren't already well off financially could hold all the way up passed 100% then 200%, then 500% and so on? Not many I'm guessing. 
I wonder if it has something to do with gambling psychology where you are more upset by the money you didn't make compared to the money you did, even if your profits are multiple times your original investment.

I had about 5 BTC back in the 300 days, spent it all, watched the rise all the way up to 9500 and decided to buy back in. Thinking about getting some more now, waiting for a dip but every day is green, it's ridiculous.

Yeah, and these stock exchange traders get to close the book at 4pm Friday and get the weekend off. 
They don't know the stress of 24/7 trading.

Yet this trash is upvoted instead of us focusing on our own coin.

Thanks to Bitcoin, my nerves can ride out any financial crisis the market has coming.

Lost money? As in bought high and sold low? That doesn't make it a scam. That's just poor trading. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 10:31:30
Yeah, how many charts out there were wrong?

The volatility of people's opinions on this sub is worse than that of the BTC price. It's hilarious. One day we are getting promised the moon and the next it's the end of the world.
This is crypto trading folks. If you don't want to see half your portfolio lost in a day, go buy Alphabet shares or something.

Transfer to an Australian based exchange? BTCmarkets or Coinjar?

This is the opposite of HODL.
Having the plates on a 15 year old Subaru would be more applicable.

I'm not sure the ethereum sub is going to be able to answer why you in particular think it is a scam, I'm sure they'd tell me the complete opposite. 
I was only responding to the discussion that was already started here. But anyway, sorry for taking away one of your magical internet points.

Someone has to do it.

Go rocket, GO!
My dream of owning 1BTC is coming true.

I struggle to find places to spend it. And no, I'm not paying a 3rd party my coins to charge me a premium just to convert it back to fiat to give to the actual receiver. Eg livingroomofsatoshi or other such services.
I went through a period of actively looking for vendors that will accept it, but I've mostly given up on that now.

This is incredibly accurate.

ALL IN
Sell your car, sell your house, sell your wife, everything into BTC
