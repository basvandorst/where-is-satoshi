you're right, like the internet before http, bitcoin is useless without LN. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:18:24
In this case it would be like planting a tree before there was any soil xD
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:24:10
with steam droping bitcoin I think mainstream adoption isn't quite here yet. Wait for the lightning storm tho :P
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:45:43
it's not the next gold, gold is pathetic compared to what Bitcoin will become 
@_date: 2014-03-18 17:46:26
Holy shit this is so perfect.
@_date: 2014-03-20 19:52:54
People lost money because they lost it on an exchange, I don't think many will quit thinking that bitcoins are too scary.
@_date: 2014-04-11 22:01:01
trollers get top comment too apparently.
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:17:21
Yeah, that's exactly why it would make the perfect cover.

After Im done transfering my btcs on my first electrum wallet I will create a second one and transfer the funds from my first electrum wallet to this one. I had a blockchain.info wallet so thats why Im doing it, I think once I do that I just need to go back on my first electrum wallet ( which will be empty) and sweep the private keys. I dont know about the next step, I have an electron cash wallet on another computer ready to receive the bch but I dont even know what the sweeping of the private keys is supposed to do xD 
Cant wait to be done with this
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:07:23
I all of those things you mentionned, sorry I wasn't precise enough.  The problem I have is that after all of this I still see my bcc balance at 0. I tried changing servers to make sure I was on a BCC server and restart the electron cash wallet but it somehow still doesnt work.
@_date: 2017-08-04 15:48:53
I don't understand your first step. What do I do to move my bitcoins on the bitcoin chain?
@_date: 2017-08-04 19:49:17
Actually I FINALLY found out how to get the private key for the only adress I used on my original electrum wallet, so I copied that into the  sweep private keys of the electron cash wallet and put the deposit adress of a shapeshift trade as the adress in the same window and I cant press sweep somehow. Still greyed out :/ 
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:56:47
You are right, I fixed this problem and I got to see my BCC balance! but then I tried to send my bccs to an adress and I get this error saying The transaction is rejected by the network and I may need to upgrade, even tho Im on 2.9.2 version of the electron cash wallet... Really curious situation, maybe its the server still?
edit: IT WAS THE FUCKING SERVER! I DID IT! now my bcc are being sold and I am getting the free monies!! thank you so much my friend &lt;3
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:08:10
I did that but it is still not working :/ Balance at 0 even if I use the BCC servers and restart my electron cash wallet.
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:54:09
I worked out this problem now, I do see a transaction history and I did see my balance. I tried to send it to an adress and then I get the error : The transaction was rejected by network rules: we may need to upgrade blah blah) but I am on version 2.9.2, whats wrong?
edit: IT WAS THE FUCKING SERVER! I DID IT! now my bcc are being sold and I am getting the free monies!! thank you so much for your help!
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:52:08
THIS. IS. SPARTAAAAAAAA
@_date: 2017-08-04 19:34:07
Im almost completely done but when I try to sweep the private key on my electron cash wallet it says to enter my private keys in the textbox but I dont know what to write here. The only thing offered by electrum wallet is a private key export, so I did that and I get a huge stack of private keys (a big paragraph of it) and if I input that in the electron cash wallet it does nothing. How do i retrieve the private key for the sweep? 
@_date: 2017-08-04 20:18:25
I have a problem selling my BCC. I just transfered my bitcoins to an electrum wallet and then from this wallet to a second electrum wallet for safety purposes. I then restored the first ( now empty ) wallet on an electron cash wallet in order to get access to my BCC but the balance says 0 mBCC. Where are my BCC? On the first blockchain wallet I had, the first electrum wallet, the second one? I dont know at all
edit:  I just tried to sweep the private key on my electron cash wallet of the adress I used to transfer bitcoins and I have an error saying no inputs found. How the hell do you get access to your BCC?

I love this one

the trustee in charge of distributing the coins decided it was only fair that people are paid back 483$ per coins while the extra money goes to Karpeless. Yes, that means he receives about a billion dollar of the money from the people he robbed. This is justice apparently.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:18:55
funny how youre directly criticizing this sub and its moderation and yet your comment is still kicking
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:06:51
then that means bitcoin isnt the real bitcoin and shitcoin cash ALSO isnt since its calling itself bitcoin...are bitcoins even REAL?!!1?
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:23:41
Oh theres a simple solution for that. Buy today and never sell.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:40:10
i find you quite immature to think banning comments not following sub guidelines is censorship
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:35:05
Probably a smart move, just make sure you dont wait too long if it doesnt happen! :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:46:39
go to reddit.comfor info, been following it for years in hope of getting my money back and I'm almost out of hope. currently there's a group of creditors getting together to sue to get our money, hopefully it will turn out for the best. fuck karpeles tbh
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:44:06
deeply disturbing to me, but I think crypto people aren't as vapid as your average American, but that's just me hoping 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:44:37
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:22:56
you're absolutely right, to me their way of doing things seems awfully familiar... this is how trump was elected. lie, play the victim, make no counter argument and play dirty behind the scenes. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:41:58
Its over dude, bitcoin had a nice run but its clearly over now, you should sell before its too late!!1!!1
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:32:31
denial and false hopes I assume
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:47:43
Yup its been too late ever since it hit 5$.
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:46:58
Im the prince of niger and I have 10000 bitcoins, just send me 100 and I will repay you with thousands of btcs
@_date: 2017-05-20 23:45:37
You must be new to bitcoins
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:07:43
Of course it won't, its the other way around. I'm not scared because it won't go below that, the price isn't affected by what I know. 
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:11:55
After 7 years of hodling I fear i lost my ability to let go forever
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:02:59
And probably the last place I'll hear it
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:48:37
You're new if you really think this is gunna go anywhere below 1700
@_date: 2017-06-17 07:45:21
No clue but I wanna know too, what do I have to do if there's 2 bitcoins? 
@_date: 2017-06-16 01:42:22
First you have to start meditating twice daily for an hour with a mantra, kinda like "ommmmmmmm", but you say "Hodddddddddlllllllllll". After about 1 year you should purchase bitcoins with every spare cent you can find while frantically selling your property and then spend your days asking people the price of bitcoin since you dont have a cellphone or computer anymore and when they say "oh its been going up" you answer with I KNEW IT ! and if they talk about a price drop you say "HA! WEAK HANDS FOLDING". You may even get extra money for being on the streets looking like a hobo so you can invest that into bitcoin too
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:56:02
Lets wait and see it then! 
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:04:28
I've been through the mtgox fiasco, believe me I'm not scared. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:10:42
Just ride the wave till August 
@_date: 2013-10-24 05:41:53
When you say can't, do you mean it just takes a while or it just doesn't work? because I don't really mind myself having to wait 3-4 weeks to get my money back as long as it makes it.
@_date: 2013-10-24 22:19:55
still ok for me! lol but it looks like a pain for everyone that wants it fast :S
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:06:14
Wow, now I'm confused as to why so many people post these things on r/bitcoin. That's quite a shame, thanks for showing me that sub btw!
@_date: 2013-10-24 02:46:14
The bubble looked indeed like it was "popped" due to a various number or events happening at the same time, but now this seems much more unlikely since a lot of these things have been stabilized.
