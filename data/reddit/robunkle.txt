Myself and many of my friends.  My highest purchase was at $1,100 rate.  the amount I purchased for that rate is in my cold storage / "savings account" for a while.
The amount I'm purchasing now I keep buying everyday transactions with.  My Food with foodler.com, my recently purchased new mattress with  overstock.com,  my android tablet with Amazon.com via gyft.   I love spending it... and saving still!

There are bitcoin ATMs in Hong Kong.  Just look them up on coinmap.org.

Thanks!  I do not do this for a living.  Just a fan.  I'm not a technical person at all, so I read this as slow as I could imagine myself being able to take it all in.
I made the visual aspects to complete the concept of an "audiobook" with charts.

Well, it's was the first day and when someone tried to buy 100 euros worth it timed out, but then it worked fine.

Vice has been talking about bitcoin in several articles for the last 2 years... old news
@_date: 2014-05-08 01:57:04
as long as someone somewhere has 1 computer in the world with the downloaded qt wallet... every bitcoin transaction will remain intact.

Anything beyond coinmap?  There isn't a lot on that website aside from people renting our their apartments.

After hearing both versions, they both lend different aspects to listeners.  This version has the visualization going for it and slower reading speed for us noobs than Stefan's version ;-).
@_date: 2015-01-04 05:52:35
so if it hits the halving and it's still around this price.... this is no good.
@_date: 2015-01-07 21:31:23
a 15% upswing / downswing is just another day in crypto.  This means very little.

Doesn't sound like Dorain Nakamoto, so couldn't be.

@_date: 2013-11-13 22:00:52
my personal opinion is it will hit $1,000 before it crashes, but I don't foresee it hitting $100 again....EVER.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:45:49
This is very helpful dude!  Thanks so much!
How safe is Electrum?  Do you use it?  I have most of my BTC in cold storage right now but want to start buying a few things with it.
