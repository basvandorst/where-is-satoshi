False. I actually thought there was a huge number of banned people and various large spikes in banning, but after doing some internal research, it turns out that bans have been quite steady over the last 1 year. The bans enacted have also been more or less legitimate bans, based on the principle of 'moderation'. "Dissent" has nothing to do with it, and nor does "valid complaints". Both are permitted here. What is not permitted is promotion of "clients without overwhelming consensus" (note this crucially means consensus of the Bitcoin technical community [not of lay people on Reddit, sorry], which is 90%+ in favor of Bitcoin Core's approach, and consistently has been) -- discussion of underlying technology has always been fine, and it is always improving (things are better, for example, than 1 year ago in the heat of the drama).
Also, I'd just point out this "valid claim" assertion is also false (IMO). But that discussion would take forever, and I do not wish to digress.


False, again (in terms of the spirit of what you claim). There must of course be someone who controls these things (they don't control themselves, autonomously). The key point is lack of centralization of control. bitcoin.org is co-owned by at least 2 people. The 'repository' shares no one in common with bitcoin.org, nor with has at its head theymos, who also co-owns bitcoin.org, but: a) bitcoin.org is a privately owned site (theymos has a right to it, along with cobra the other co-owner), b) is a privately owned sub (so again, theymos has full right to it), c) Both of the aforementioned simply follow consensus -- they do not arbitrarily follow one client or another, or pick winners, per se.
Also, regarding bitcoin.org, note the existence of bitcoincore.org -- it provides Bitcoin Core independence from bitcoin.org, so there again, there is actually decentralization of control.

I have already explained how this allegation is false (and I tried to explain the nuance of it), and yet you keep repeating it in a simple manner, as if this is a valid point. It is not a valid point. Stop fabricating reality, please. This creation of a false reality is a large part of why the conflict exists. Before r/btc existed, I spent a lot of time trying to state what I thought was obvious (backed by evidence), yet a certain contingent was never interested in the lack of evidence, and kept repeating certain allegations. What happened is that contingent then moved to r/btc, where they happily engage in this practice 24/7.

GreenAddress has always been staffed by competent engineers (who I've discussed things with), but with the acquisition by Blockstream, I know many of the finest minds in cryptocurrency are also now implicitly backing (and improving) GreenAddress. There is also the aspect that $76 million has been raised by Blockstream from investors, which does not happen unless the company has a certain degree of legitimacy and oversight.
This is enough to know to trust GreenAddress above most other wallets, and at least to rank it in the upper echelon. When it comes to your wallet, the choice is very important because it secures your money; it's not a joking matter. So, the competence of the engineers/company involved is very important.

Hey u/cryptolution, well, the AMA itself could be stickied, once it's ready to be conducted. Getting the word out ahead of time (advertising to help boost the quality of the ensuing AMA) could perhaps be achieved with a thread the week before (created by u/DavidShrier, perhaps) that announces the impending AMA, provides details, and asks for preliminary questions. Sample questions could also be provided by the AMA organizers, if they feel there is anything in particular that needs clarifying. This would give two separate opportunities for questions to be gathered, and would also allow some extra time for the respondents to write comprehensive answers. As for the final AMA thread, it can be set by default to be sorted in a special "q&amp;a" format, so as to help make the thread organized in a fashion appropriate for the purpose.

All of the Lightning code that you requested is available there. It's meant as a completely public decentralized network, so it makes sense for it to be open-source.
As for Liquid, it's inherently a proprietary product (and Blockstream does need to make money, right? They can only do so with some proprietary product / service, so Liquid is an example of something that serves this purpose), so of course there will be aspects to it that cannot be open-sourced. It's not meant for use by the public in an open manner; it's only for use between institutions (like Bitcoin market exchanges). But, the useful aspects of it that can be open-sourced have been (e.g. segwit, confidential transactions).

This does not concern "altcoins" -- something is not termed an "altcoin" by default, just because one disagrees with it (just as XT/Classic were *not* "altcoins", but rather contentious / non-consensus hard-fork proposals). ChainAnchor is an issue relevant to Bitcoin, owing to the recent controversy over it. There is hard proof showing that this technology was, even if only at one point, developed with possible application to Bitcoin. Whether those answering peoples' questions want to admit that or not is neither here nor there. Everyone will have an opportunity to ask questions, and have their questions answered.
Ignoring this issue will not magically make it go away. Discussion is the sensible course of action.

What exactly did you evaluate yourself?
From what you stated in the comment that I replied to, I read nothing evincing that you did any evaluation. All I read was you saying the same thing that I've seen before from others (mostly of the "maximalist" variety; I also noticed Peter Todd likes to get involved in this &amp; speak when he doesn't know what he's talking about -- every time I see someone does this btw, I wonder what other situations in the past have people I respected talked confidently/arrogantly without actually knowing the facts?), hence why I said "parroting".


Any elaboration?


Cool story, but again, there's a backstory about this. This topic is many months old.


A lie, according to who? According to you? What makes you a judge of whether or not they are lying about it?


It's actually only shameful, if it was a lie. Yet, there is no conclusion about this (except for the opinion of yourself, and others who prefer to judge and treat IOTA and its community as a second-class-citizen, simply because it's not Bitcoin &amp; because that's how maximalists behave -- which, in fact, is the truly 'shameful' thing).


The 'centralization' you refer to is also an age-old topic, with plenty of discussion. That aspect is temporary, not permanent, and it's even described in the white paper as such.
IOTA is not a random cryptocurrency like all the others (most of which are essentially clones); its origination and design is specifically based on working in the IoT and related industry. It is not intended to appeal to the average "crypto bro", yet investment desires nevertheless cause that crowd to become involved.


Again, according to who -- you? You can't simply make declarations and expect them to be taken for granted.


From what I saw of their reporting (btw, it's not MIT -- it's MIT Media Lab's DCI wing, which is separate from the rest of MIT), as well as IOTA team's responses to it, those involved with DCI have various conflicts of interest, so their reporting was indeed biased.
Also, their report was countered ages ago, and countered again.
CFB provided his emails transparently months ago (emails from the email chain prior to that report), while the other participants refused to be transparent and provide their emails.
I personally publicly directly pinged all those participants from DCI on Bitcoin Core Slack (as well as other 'maximalist' types who joined the bandwagon during the various drama episodes), and received literally zero response (except from one journalist) to my request for further comment and response.
The only thing I have seen from IOTA's critics over time is frankly total nonsense (directed in a one-way manner, with no desire to have a two-way conversation), as well as an extremely offensive attitude from these critics where they essentially treat IOTA's team and its community as second-class citizens (e.g. IOTA supporters on Twitter earlier accused of being 'bots' or such, and not real people, when they "dared" to defend IOTA against accusations -- the idea that they are 'bots' and not real humans is laughable).
The situation as a whole would be hilarious, if it were not sad and tragic, as the maximalist and openly-offensive and elitist philosophy (that blanket-terms anything that isn't bitcoin a shitcoin), which is promoted by the most hardcore of these parties, is inherently anti-free market.
Yet, the cryptocurrency market, of which bitcoin is a part, is of course based on a free market. Bitcoin is a free market approach to 'money', which is what makes it attractive vs. national fiat money (and even gold: see paper gold vs. physical gold controversy).
So, the maximalist philosophy is destined for failure (and already failing: BTC dominance fell from 90% to 40%, recently rose to 60%, then fell again even lower to 33%), as ETH is now 60% of BTC's market cap, and the trend seems possibly destined to reach its conclusion.
And frankly, setting aside the speculation about whether BTC will even lose its top position (to ETH, or something else), one thing is clear: the offensive and anti-free market approach of maximalists is surely destined to fail. Reality and free markets simply do not work this way. I am personally turned off by the elitist maximalist approach, and yet I still support Bitcoin and hold sizeable amount of it (because I try not to conflate these things emotionally), but watching the anti-reality words and actions of maximalists is a massive turn-off &amp; intuitively feels very wrong -- it certainly doesn't beget confidence.

I use various banks, and am not charged fees like you. And if rarely there is a fee and it doesn’t make sense to me, then I call the bank and dispute the fee, and the fee is removed 90% of the time.

Maybe they are acting with the main priority being: "overall health of the network"? It wouldn't be dis-incentivized. If overall health improves, then Bitcoin has higher chance of increasing in price. That would be much more profitable for them, than to gain minor extra hashrate percentage (and simultaneously lower health by making network more centralized).
@_date: 2015-12-01 21:51:16


Okay, I'll just take your word for it. The point stands though. The average confirmation time is 7 min for each of the hypothetical 1,000 transactions, and that probability doesn't change for any particular transaction. So, on average, it's likely to be enough of a window for someone to quickly cancel, if needed.


Solved, how? What's the idea, where's the code, where's the proposal? My point is just that: unless we have something, this 'irreversible transaction' nature of Bitcoin seems to be a major stumbling block on path to mass adoption. It frankly makes it a bit dangerous to use, for the average person, since there is no recourse if you make a mistake. If we have an opt-in solution that works, then it sounds like a good idea.

This is easy to "desire", but real life implementation is impossible to achieve by merely raising block size limit. Transactions still take avg. 10 min to confirm, and that is not changing. Also, raising limit to a huge extent will increase capacity sure, but also centralize the decentralized cryptocurrency. If it was this easy to solve, it would be solved by now.
The only genuine solution will be something like Lightning, so better hope it comes to fruition:

Yes, I'd argue 2.3 TPS represents the average limit that is the "max acceptable time", or rather the "ideal max acceptable time" (it represents wait time of 1 block). But no, I don't think we're at capacity, if you look at the typical capacity usage right now.
For more info, see if this post explains:


Pay particular attention to the TradeBlock demand projection image.
This research has been out for ages, but no one cites it! Everyone keeps talking about "in the air" ideas, which is really irritating. I've pointed this out numerous times, but it never seems to catch on. I even pointed it out to u/gavinandresen recently, and he basically ignored it.


Yes, ideally, that's how things would work. However, miners have refused block size increase beyond 2-4 MB. In fact, 2 MB seems like the most the majority of hashrate is willing to accept, based on their opinions given in Hong Kong. This is just the reality of the situation. So, that's what we have to work with?
In light of that, a soft-fork rollout of SW within 3 months (or sooner!) looks like a good target. We can approximately double capacity to about 4.0 TPS (1 block wait time), via SW, and soon after, in the following 6 months, deploy a hard fork block size increase plan (following release &amp; testing of IBLT / weak blocks / etc.).
@_date: 2015-12-18 21:57:36
Haha, sorry man. I'm just uh, very worried about Bitcoin. Things feel like they are in a dangerous place, where emotions may be high and rash decisions may be made by various parties. I don't want to see a fracture in Bitcoin, and I'm worried about it because I really love Bitcoin and want to see it succeed (which it won't, if these fractures continue). I'll only say something if I have a reasonable degree of confidence it's correct, so I do want to present my analysis so people can verify &amp; help make informed decisions.

I agree with 2-4-8... but I wonder if 3-6-9, or actually 4-8-16, are also viable, and would possibly make for a superior compromise, u/adam3us?
4 would be halfway between 2 (2-4-8) and 8 (BIP101). If it's at all technically / economically feasible (ref: C. Decker's research), then maybe this will be best to help bring the community back together.
Maybe, 2MB would be cutting things close.
Even with Lightning, we will still ultimately need a much bigger block size. There has also been [discussion]( that suggests Lightning's projections for block size may be underestimated. If so, this increases the block size required.

Don't get me wrong; I understand your argument, and I felt the same irritation, when I saw that phrase used. It sounds like a 'political talking point' to me. However, the other view is that they are being optimistic, and assuming tech will arrive to fill the space in time.
I don't think that's wise (as it's clear you also don't); it's better to have a tested solution ready, whether that's IBLT / weak blocks / or whatever else, before making such a fundamental change.
Even toomim's testing of BIP101 showed anything larger than 4 MB  is excessive. In fact, he said 3 MB is probably the realistic limit. And I'm not sure what his data said about BIP101's 41% rate of increase -- I can't imagine that's realistic.

There is a feature called "opt-in RBF" that was recently made part of the Bitcoin Core software. That allows you to re-send a transaction with a slightly higher fee, which would allow you to do that and send it back to yourself as a "refund". However, it's not been integrated into wallets yet. When it's more widespread and wallets start using it though, it should be trivial to "cancel"/"refund" these kinds of stuck transactions.
@_date: 2015-12-01 21:31:32


Really? Source?


I don't know about that. That's speculation :). Like we said, the 'average' is 7-10 min; so probability dictates that there is a higher chance of 7-10 min confirmation time, rather than 'less than a minute'. Every single transaction in the hypothetical 1,000 txs will take on average 7-10 min.
It's not perfect, but it's certainly way, way, way better than having zero recourse as users do currently.


What's a better solution?
@_date: 2015-12-09 14:41:50
u/gavinandresen says SW changes nothing for capacity.


But, I thought the SW proposal on the table effectively doubles capacity (equivalent of ~2 MB block size increase, but via soft fork):


Also, since a soft-fork can be rolled out much faster (and more cleanly, with less ecosystem disruption) than a hard fork, it also does seem like a "short-term solution".
@_date: 2015-12-04 04:17:08
Okay, but you keep repeating "$20". That's not accurate.
Also, it sounds unrealistic to expect $0.01 with current Bitcoin, if you want to also maintain anti-spam and decentralized network. Only Lightning could allow such a tiny fee (actually tinier), while maintaining the properties.

That doesn't in any way excuse u/theymos from threatening to ban Bitstamp because Bitstamp's CEO had the audacity to express his opinion on BIP101. I'm fairly sure u/livincalifornia is expressing his thought in response to that scandal.
Even if -- "a large subset of BIP101 advocates have been incredibly unreasonable" -- was true, are you endorsing the idea that threatening to ban the company from r/bitcoin is a good idea? That it would do anything to improve the tensions, or dissuade Bitstamp (because they are "scared" of a ban)? That companies now need to take *permission* from Theymos before saying anything? If I were Bitstamp's CEO, and I heard that Theymos had said this, it would make me indignant, and make me redouble my resolve to implement BIP101.
Theymos simply has no right to use his power here to then threaten companies with bans because they do something he doesn't like.
I don't know who is feeding Theymos this retarded strategy, or if he is coming up with it on his own (or is merely impulsive &amp; unable to realize how foolish it is), but it hurts EVERYONE on this side of the debate. His actions the past 6 months have made life 10x harder for everyone including u/adam3us, by making the 'other side' [emotional]( &amp; [angry]( &amp; [suspicious]( from censorship (and thus even more resistant to logic &amp; reason).

"Perfect security requires a perfect human", also for gold. Hence, we can eliminate that commonality.
A competent user can secure something better than an incompetent user. This applies to both gold and bitcoin. Hence, we can actually eliminate that commonality from consideration, too.

Yes. Extremely difficult problem to solve, however.
Some ideas:
* mining integrated in consumer electronics and distributed globally (21 and possibly also BitFury are working on this)
* abundant excess energy from residential rooftop solar being put into mining, on a large scale
* end of mining ASIC's large efficiency improvements leading to high competition among miners in selling ASICs to individuals (competition --&gt; decent efficiency at decent price)
* intense expanded competition from other chip makers
* magical software engineering solution

No, it's merely an if/then statement. If consensus moves to an alternative implementation, then that's great but they won't be interested in volunteering their time &amp; energy to it.

What about mining domination? I've heard this before, too:


@_date: 2015-12-25 18:44:45
Well, transactions are not free. Transactions which don't pay an adequate fee don't have a right to be relayed by miners, who incur high operating costs to provide security to the Bitcoin network. As such, various pools have even started increasing the minimum fee/size they accept, so as to filter out free/low-fee/size transactions. By relaying it yourself, you're merely wasting your own resources, since miners will not accept those free-loader transactions anyway.

I did not post this to bring attention to you, Peter R. I posted this to demonstrate evidence of the devious, subversive, and devilish attitude of the XT side, of which you and your buddies (incl. Gavin) are chief proponents. This is extremely disturbing, and your response here is even more disturbingly out-of-touch, if that was possible. -- Are you a psychopath?
Regarding the paper, I already saw it. The topic of "weak blocks" has been discussed by many different people over the course of the past years. In fact, if you read u/nullc's capacity increase plan from 2 weeks ago, you would see he also cited the concept as being critical for further block size increase-based scaling:
* 
"Going beyond segwit, there has been some considerable activity brewing around more efficient block relay.  There is a collection of proposals, some stemming from a p2pool-inspired informal sketch of mine and some independently invented, called **"weak blocks", "thin blocks" or "soft blocks"**.  These proposals build on top of efficient relay techniques (like the relay network protocol or IBLT) and move virtually all the transmission time of a block to before the block is found, eliminating size from the orphan race calculation. We already desperately need this at the current block sizes. These have not yet been implemented, but fortunately the path appears clear. I've seen at least one more or less complete specification, and I expect to see things running using this in a few months. This tool will remove propagation latency from being a problem in the absence of strategic behavior by miners.  Better understanding their behavior when miners behave strategically is an open question." &gt; 
I also recently posted a submission on the exact same concept from u/gidze:
* 
@_date: 2015-12-18 17:58:58
Yeah, I'm not certain about the numbers (though the numbers might be fine too -- this bumps us to 2MB in 2016 -- and effectively 3.5MB with SW), but the structure is great. It's the first proposal I've seen with this kind of higher-to-lower-rate structure, yet done in a simple manner. I'm also thrilled that it's getting more diverse support than any other proposal so far (besides SW). I also like it has a "long-term baseline increase" conservative aspect to it.

Um, what does this situation have to do with substantiating the allegation that theymos is involved with turning r/bitcoin into a Blockstream outlet? This situation is theymos making a completely ill-advised comment about 'banning Bitstamp' -- it's totally irrelevant to Blockstream + Core + everything else. It's about theymos + his opinion on Bitstamp.

How far in the future is this? Lightning ETA for testnet is ~3 months. I agree that without a viable layer 2 (like Lightning) and appropriately increasing block size, this isn't viable. But with Lightning &amp; block size increases commensurate with demand (but also respecting decentralization metrics), everything will work out (smaller fees than right now, instant 'confirmation', unlimited transactions after opening channel, etc.).

Except... central bank meetings are closed to the public, and debated in secret among a small group of people. The Scaling Conference  in Hong Kong is open to the public, and a wide variety of people are attending, as well as miners and other companies.
Also, unlike the Central Bank meeting, no final decision is being made at the conference.
So, no, I don't see any similarity.

Which, if it happened, would result in a massive lawsuit (since those funds are property of the users) + loss of trust in their businesses and, likely, the end of their businesses. I doubt the CEOs are going to be irrational enough to attempt something so controversial.
Anyway, this ignores the fact that miners will not activate XT/101 if they do not believe it is the most rational choice. And, as we have seen, the miners are 99% anti-XT and 90% anti-101.

I don't think it's illogical at all. I used your own words to make my point.
I agree Bitcoin has multiple factors that must be secure, in order for a user's bitcoins to be secure. The assumption was that the network's incentive structure is sound, and hence the network itself will remain sound.
If the issue is securing bitcoins, then that can surely be done by a competent user (whether by: paper wallet, custom hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor, addition of multisig or BIP38, etc.). The assumption behind my statement was that the user is competent, and that's the same assumption you originally made too.
It's far easier to authenticate bitcoin than gold, it's far easier to properly store bitcoin than any sizable amount of gold, ditto for transport, etc.

Core has committed firmly to a timeline of "April 2016". I don't think Core would make this commitment, unless it was sure it was possible. They don't take these things lightly (as you might imagine).


It does not "require" upgrading; non-upgraded will work fine. It is opt-in. The incentive to upgrade is lower tx fees, and higher capacity for those who upgrade.
2nd largest iOS wallet has already committed to support SW soft-fork, as soon as it's available. If they can do it, obviously any larger wallet can do the same. Devs are also available to assist integration efforts.


Only small amount of testing, if you're talking about something like BIP102. Anything else, and testing time increases.
Also, "couple months" is not realistic at all. Even Garzik's latest proposal needs "6 months" for its relatively quick deployment speed. Let's be fair + unbiased + realistic :). And, Wuille would argue a hard fork needs 12 months for a safer deployment. Which is correct, I don't know. But, let's say 9 months for "safe-ish".






Don't get so comfortable with them. Remember the critical point that a hard fork is opt-OUT, not opt-in, meaning it forces the Bitcoin protocol to change. This is serious. If we get "comfortable" with hard forks, it means that in the future, this comfort can be taken advantage of. Especially if the network centralizes further, then imagine how dangerous it can be. This is potentially fatal. Hard forks should never be easy to do, and ideally -- everything should occur via an opt-in soft fork.
Anyway, now that I made that clear, I don't want to further the narrative that "Core never wants a hard fork". Read the FAQ, and you'll see numerous references to how Core is fine with a hard fork block size increase, but only later in 2016 or early 2017 (once tech improvements enable larger increases).
For now, SW's ~2x increase is approx. equivalent to all the viable hard-fork proposals in their 2016 impact.
This is truly the best path to take. I don't know how else to say this. Well, I do. I tried explaining similar things here: 
@_date: 2015-12-09 15:21:18
It's a soft-fork that leads to higher capacity.
There's an advantage in terms of postponing ecosystem disruption, by going with a soft-fork route vs. hard-fork route, as long as possible. -- so I'd argue it is in fact a better solution to short-term scaling than merely raising block size via hard fork.
p.s. I've edited original post to make it super clear what I'm referring to with Gavin's words.
@_date: 2015-12-02 00:46:40


See Peter's comments:


Also, I don't think it makes sense to ignore their direct words. They said literally that 2 MB was what they were most comfortable with, but agreed to 8 MB to not "offend" Gavin (i.e. to try to be nice).
As for this "personal reasons" argument -- they said clearly it's a technical issue.
But even otherwise, I think that's perfectly valid. Why should they let themselves be bullied around? Fundamentally, people need to learn to have respect. In this debate, as we've seen, there has been a large amount of toxicity. It has had little consequences supposedly, since it's "only Reddit", but it turns out in the real world that respectful discourse is important.
I also think that the other side, led by Brian Armstrong of Coinbase and occasionally by BitPay, is being disrespectful to this side. Core developers are being literally ignored &amp; disenfranchised &amp; 'removed' by Brian ("we want Gavin to lead an XT fork... others can help out... if they care to"). Their technical concerns are also being disregarded ("we are moving to BIP101 in December, regardless of what others do"). Instead of attending Scaling Bitcoin  and treating others as equals, and collaborating politely on something jointly acceptable, Brian is acting like a dictator.
If the miners aren't going to tolerate that attitude, in general, then what's the problem? This serves as a good check on such people, and encourages collaboration instead of rudeness &amp; alienation.
Satoshi intentionally created the system in this interdependent manner, and I don't think it was by accident.

This was discussed really well in the Scaling Bitcoin  Hong Kong talks by Tadge &amp; Poon (available on YouTube). They talked about the topology created by Lightning, and what is expected &amp; how the system is being designed to incentivize an optimal topology (i.e. decentralized).
@_date: 2015-12-22 01:57:50
Okay, here's the argument. SW soft-fork is advertised as a way to short-term scale Bitcoin's capacity (by ~2x). However, even after miner adoption, it cannot actually scale capacity by 2x UNTIL/UNLESS wallet providers update their code to "opt-in" essentially to SW. I guess in practice this means until they update their Bitcoin Core full nodes to the version that enables SW (?).
u/jgarzik does not have the information of how long wallet providers will actually take to enable that change. He wants to know that, before he can actually say it's a short-term option.
I think that's valid. Don't you? I would love for the biggest wallet providers to report that they will support SW, as soon as it's deployed. If this was stated, then I predict u/jgarzik would be much more supportive of this as a short-term scaling option.
Otherwise, it's kind of a gamble (assumption that wallets will enable it anytime soon; maybe they will postpone and dilly dally with doing the necessary work to enable it).


Coinbase and Circle and Xapo (and others?) pay their customers tx fees (these days 4 cents/transaction), so I think it's a good incentive. It's also a competitive point even for user-hosted wallets, since they can advertise lower transaction fees vs. their non-updated competing wallets.
@_date: 2015-12-17 16:52:14
This will be a problem forever, though. It will also only get much worse, as time goes on and the user base widens (dilutes). How does a problem like that get resolved? It almost seems doomed to collapse upon itself.
Although... maybe the difference is that the system can be reverted any time -- so even if the mob ends up converting Bitcoin to a dystopian system, as they then realize it's become worse, it should be possible for that same mob to demand reversion to prior status quo. As long as it's an open system (which it fundamentally is), course correction is possible. Ultimately, the 'people' (or mob, masses) will always be able to maintain control of it.
Does that sound right?
I'm not talking about merely forking (that is very difficult because of network effects), but about keeping the base system at an optimal state.
I guess the pessimistic view could be that, if certain changes are made (increasing resource requirements far beyond 'typical individual- level'), then the 'people' are thereafter priced out of having a voice. So, reversion is in fact not possible. -- Although, that might be the case even now. Ultimately, # of $ is what speaks. $1,000,000 today will have the same ultimate impact on influencing the network (assuming same size), as the same amount tomorrow (ignoring inflation) on a hypothetically more resource-intensive network, right?
If so, then the pessimistic view can be disregarded, and maybe the end result is the optimistic view (positive end result).
Maybe the ultimate solution is just to 'widen the boat', by having as much capital invested into BTC as possible (to maximize stakeholders).
@_date: 2015-06-14 02:04:24
I don't know, but an approach that ends up "wrecking Bitcoin" by pitting mining power against economic power would certainly be out of the question.

That BIP101 is dead as a doornail and has no consensus, and yet u/bdarmstrong has the nerve (ignorance?) to continue promoting it (likely because: a. Gavin &amp; Hearn support it regardless of lack of consensus, b. Coinbase can maximize its profits by saving money on tx fees, at the expense of the Bitcoin network's heath).

They clearly are well-versed in the technical aspects. That's good to see, and it should be expected given their line of business.
This is a nice summary:


The bottom line seems to be this:


This aligns with Peter's estimate of the situation in China.
If they can "barely afford 1 MB in 2015", then I guess this explains why they are only willing to gamble with up to 2 MB in 2016.
Various improvements are coming in Bitcoin Core 0.12.0 to significantly improve initial sync time (perhaps due to CPU verification improvements?). Other technological improvements may also be included (I'm not clear on the situation; it seems like every week something new is announced for inclusion, like 'Tor-by-default'). These improvements could make it for feasible for bigger blocks, but how much bigger, I don't know.
It would be cool if the miners could look at what's coming in the pipeline for 0.12.0, and do some analysis to see strictly technically speaking what is the 'ideal' (within limits) block size increase, and what they can tolerate as an 'upper limit' (exceeding technicals, but still tolerable).
If people have this kind of hard data, then scaling discussions could be conducted more effectively.
@_date: 2015-12-07 21:23:47
Supermajority of miners have said they are okay with minimum raise to 2 MB. Beyond that, I don't think I've heard anything. So, a rise to 2 MB would seem to be a minimum level that we have consensus on, aka BIP102.
Beyond that, 2-4-8 would only increase size further 2 yrs and then 4 yrs from now. Actually, miners have supported that plan too, from what I've seen.

I don't think "time for politeness" is ever over, especially for anyone in a prominent position. People in such positions have a duty and responsibility to be extremely polite, reasonable, and pragmatic -- "With great power, comes great responsibility" and all that.
Further, Bitcoin works based on 'consensus'. It doesn't work by becoming impolite and trying to force your way against the majority (this includes all groups: miners, devs, processors, exchanges, users, etc.). Doing so is a recipe for discord --&gt; lack of consensus --&gt; failure. Being polite means you can increase chance of agreement (consensus), which is the whole point.

I remember reading Lightning alpha will be ready for testnet in 2-3 months. And an estimate by a spectator puts Lightning realization within 1 year.
It's split in 2 parts. Lightning without malleability fix can come out sooner, but only used for less value. Lightning with malleability fix (like segregated witness) will come out later, and is safe to use for larger values too.

Only buy &amp; hold wrt BTC (use USD for purchases).
I guess I subscribe to Balaji Srinivasan's (21 Inc's) view of BTC:


BTC's true utility shows with:
* micro-/nano- payments
* digital gold store of value properties (no money supply expansion, no capital controls)
* uncensorable transactions where current financial system presents roadblocks (DNM, "backpage", anon purchase of VPN, etc.).
I never understood when people say it's "easier to pay with BTC" for conventional purchases. My credit card info is auto-filled in 1 second with Safari and stored securely in OS X Keychain. It's the smoothest experience.
But if you really want to "pay for everything with BTC for ideological reasons", then Coinbase's new Shift card looks seamless. And... no use of on-chain transactions, so no need to scale BTC to unheathily high TPS prematurely. Best of both worlds.

u/ajtowns gave a very comprehensive explanation why it wouldn't make sense to expect $20 fee/tx. Then, you replied with a single anecdotal experience to justify why he is wrong.

No one has patience to argue with someone, who will simply cite a random personal experience in order to make a justification.
So, to recap, u/ajtowns said:


i.e. Average expected transaction = $0.20 (with possible spike of 10x in rare circumstances)

Okay, like I said in my prior post, I also note the same thing (sometimes) in u/nullc's delivery. And yes, I keep hearing this same complaint from various people. However, no one is perfect! Surely those who complain can appreciate that? No one is perfect. We have geniuses with absolute humility, we have geniuses who are absolute assholes, and we have geniuses in between.
The fact remains: they are all geniuses, and highly valuable + productive (and IMO irreplaceable). Do I wish he was a perfectly humble guy, perfectly self-reflective, etc.? Sure. But is it acceptable to be so upset, if someone isn't perfect like that? I don't think so.
As for Gavin, sure he doesn't act arrogant *all the time*, but have you seen his posts? There are definitely examples where he starts using "all caps" or excessively "italicizes" and almost seems to be shouting or whining. He also complains against other people, which may not be arrogant, but it indicates lack of patience. Which is another vice. Lastly, I wouldn't say he is anywhere close to as smart as Greg, which sorta makes it hard to justify too much arrogance in the first place (right?).
My point is, no one is perfect. We need to remember [we are all human]( (with human nature). The important thing? [Just be yourself](
But, try to strive to be more perfectly humble, too ;).
@_date: 2015-12-08 22:21:20
He would still follow the rules. Sure, he has enormous credibility as the 'creator', but obviously logic would dictate what happens. His opinion, direction, leadership would simply have more weight.
I'm looking at this, as a bonanza in terms of productivity enhancement. Look at how much time is wasted currently with warring factions of devs. + users + businesses. This wastes a lot of money and developer hours. Also, people can try to assassinate each other's characters (as has happened), but you can't legitimately try to assassinate Satoshi's character. In other words, he would have de facto authority on the matter (maybe a "final say", or some variation).
Like I said, he should absolutely be held to the same standard as everyone else, to prevent the negative effects you mention.
Don't forget that, currently, we have the same situation where a few people have much higher authority than everyone else. That's not bad; it's just how much respect is commanded by their knowledge + expertise. Adding Satoshi to this mix can be a helpful addition, it can be reasoned.

Right, I began my post just by laying out some of the arguments I've read, but it doesn't mean I think those points are necessarily valid. My actual position came later in the post :).
What you're saying does seem valid. Still, I wonder if you and I are missing some other nuance that is not immediately apparent, since what you argued seems fairly obvious (and I'd like to give the core devs some more credit that they'd be able to think of this).
@_date: 2015-12-23 06:28:49


I don't actually agree. The last time we had the biggest spike in recent history (late 2013), the data shows total transactions increased ~1.7x at the peak of the spike, and then dropped back down after the spike. This is right around the conservative estimate of how much SegWit will increase capacity.
Basically, I think Core's priority is to stop falling behind the curve when it comes to decentralization of the network, and at least attempt to regain some decentralization of nodes &amp; hashrate, by delaying more significant block size increases (sticking with SegWit's ~2x) until better enabling technology arrives in 2016 (IBLT, weak blocks, etc.).

Hey, let's not say such things, when there is no need?
u/jgarzik is actually very knowledgeable (although doesn't choose perfect words, I guess, sometimes), and actually nearly on the same page. His concern with SW soft-fork is how quickly wallet providers will opt-in to SW and support it. He is worried because it took "years" for P2SH support to be enabled. If that concern can be alleviated, then I think it highly likely Jeff would support SW-soft-fork as a short-term scaling option.
Personally, I don't think it's concerning since wallet providers have huge incentive to support SW, since it will reduce their customers' transaction fees and allow more transactions with same size.
@_date: 2015-12-30 22:16:48
Yes, and that's fine. It's only a short-term solution. Beyond that, block size increases may be the only alternative. For that to be practical, groundwork will be laid in 2016.

Doing this would not just be a 'FU' to miners, it would also be self-sabotage and a 'FU' to ourselves. Bitcoin's security would be destroyed, and we'd be in a vulnerable state having to start from scratch. In other words, it would not be a system valued at securing the current $6+ billion USD anymore, and would necessarily undergo a revaluation (i.e. price would plummet by orders of magnitude -- maybe by 10-100x).
We need a real (viable) solution, and should stop regurgitating this idea as realistic.  cc: u/pb1x

Long answer:








@_date: 2015-12-02 00:18:50
Cool! Hope you're having a nice time, outside of the shitty Internet.
And yet, they're okay with 2MB, it seems? Maybe because there is a lot of pressure to increase, so they are trying to cooperate?
TradeBlock did some great analysis on block size trends. They estimated that by mid-2016, block size would reach congestion such that average TPS would be &gt; 2.3 -- and that 2.3 TPS represents the level at which block confirmation time starts to exceed 1 block (a nice metric for practical limits of the network). Based on this too, doubling block size from 1 to 2 MB would seem to perhaps address the issue sufficiently for now (for how long? I'm not sure).

You implied Charlie is making a decision in BTC's worst interest. You tried to slur his name, in other words. I'm well aware you're only taking about Charlie, but I'm saying you conveniently decided to ignore the larger context. Obviously without that context, Charlie's actions would be suspect. But, given the context + given Charlie's lengthy explanations of his views, your accusation makes 0 sense.

That's true, but what about the established Bitcoin mining network that is more than 100x larger than Google's network, to secure the coin? How will GreekCoin achieve that in any reasonable amount of time, if ever? And, what about wallet apps and payment processors, to allow GreekCoin to be used?
Basically, "GreekCoin" will have no ecosystem behind it, while Bitcoin already does have an established and fairly mature ecosystem. Greeks already use Bitcoin, and so do people in every other country around the world.

Exactly :)
Supermajority consensus is far, far, far, far, far, far more important than most people realize. Especially, as pretty much most of the heavyweight technical experts (pretty much all the Blockstream cryptographic guys) are opposed to 20 MB. If we ignore/sideline their views, it's completely unrealistic to imagine a pretty transition. Instead, more likely (and sadly enough stated literally by certain members of their team), their will be great animosity (which has already begun germinating!), which means Bitcoin will not gain sidechains/Lightning/zerocash (all connected to Blockstream) in the future. Further, it will lose the enthusiasm by Blockstream members to continue developing it in less revolutionary ways too.
I'm **really** irked that Gavin has lately been risking everything for his 20MB/XT push. Thank fucking God he backed down from his '20 MB, and fuck the haters' position in this latest post. I hope people can continue to make sure he sees sense and get his tyrannical pattern out. I don't know who he thinks he is, or what has gotten into him. I've been finally browsing other posts in the Mailing List too, and Gavin's attitude has been more and more prevalent. He sounds like a bully, and as if he thinks he is CEO rather than an equal member.
FYI, here's something that's really worth examining, in case you missed it. Adam Back of Blockstream posted his thoughts here:
* 
More specifically, he linked to what looks like a very creative 'compromise' solution:
* 
I was considering making a thread out of this, but I don't know how to title it and describe it. Also, if you scroll down to the bottom and look at the 3 responses, Gavin did respond and his response was utterly arrogant and passive-aggresive and implicitly dismissive of the opinion of Adam Back and co. (as eloquently expressed in the former link I posted above) that decentralization and cheap-to-run nodes is core to Bitcoin's ethos and cypherpunk philosophy (which is espoused by Blockstream).
brought 2 links to my attention, posts by Mike Hearn in response to Adam Back's idea. It helps provide more perspective and is quite valuable in understanding the situation better.

Agree with your sentiments, but just to rant a little, I think it's sickening that a single person (Gavin) has this much apparent control over Bitcoin's direction, especially when there is no shortage of highly knowledgeable and creative individuals involved in Bitcoin (either in academia, in universities like MIT and Princeton, VC firms, companies, and other core members like Garzik, etc.).

Ugly? I think the priority is accurate information. $0.00013 is way more accurate than $0.00, and furthermore way less misleading.
Also, your example is a bit hyperbolic. The lowest fee possible right now is 0.00001 btc, so the lowest $-denominated fee is:
0.00001 btc * $225/btc = $0.00225, which is 1 less decimal place than your example (thus not quite as 'ugly').

100% observational, but notice late-2013 price overshot relative to the past. So, it's logical that price then undershoots thereafter. Perhaps that's partly to blame for the divergence, and the recent violent movements upward represent the correction higher (reversion to mean).
One concern about transactions though is that they can be gamed (and have been, in the past spam attacks in July + August). So, how does manipulation of those numbers factor into all this, if we hypothetically accept the relationship exists? Is the assumption that if we average it out enough, then manipulation noise can disappear and the data remains meaningful? Maybe, erase those obvious manipulations from Jul + Aug, at least, and see what happens.
Also, what about capital invested? Directly speaking, the more capital is invested in the underlying asset (BTC), the higher the price. In other words, it's not just how many transactions are made (maybe # of transactions has value because you need capital to make transactions?), but also how much capital is stored in BTC (hodl-ed as store of value in certain areas, or hodl-ed as a bet on future utility as store of value).

I don't think there's a black &amp; white answer.
As of now, Chinese can't handle more than max 4MB, and more ideally for them around 1MB (or 2MB after factoring in improvements from the upcoming Bitcoin Core 0.12). Maybe there's a range of 2-4MB for them? I think that's the first &amp; most important metric to consider, since they are important stakeholders, and since we don't even need a massive increase in capacity beyond 2-4x in the short-term. Why create conflict, if it's not needed?
But to answer your question, I don't think there is a clear answer:
* Decker has said that problems begin "slightly beyond 1MB" (but not sure if this includes effects of 0.12) (
* BitFury notes BIP101 will cause large node loss ( ...+... 
* jtoomim has said Chinese may be able to handle 3MB, from his BIP101 testing (source?)
You should read the primary sources behind these things.

However, there was almost universal pushback, including from Core devs. Also, his statement was foolish because the event did not even occur yet; It was a hypothetical. So, nothing has actually happened on either side.
I'm talking about overall quality of discussion on this sub being superior. The only thing explicitly banned here is: "promoting hostile hard fork" (XT). The reasoning of u/theymos is BTC works on basis of consensus (mutual agreement of majority). This means discussing XT's BIP101 is fine, but not promoting XT itself.
I disagree with the policy. Yes, consensus is critical, but you're not increasing chances of consensus with that policy. I think it's misguided &amp; dogmatic, rather than pragmatic. At the end of the day, IMO, pragmatism is the only realistic way forward that will lead to a form of success, rather than risking failure.
Non-pragmatic decision making is extremely risky on net, and the risks do not outweigh the benefits.

The developers need to somehow isolate themselves from the crazies &amp; low-info ignoramuses &amp; trolls; it's as simple as that.
They should utilize 1-way communication mechanisms, and perhaps employ a 'filter' to deliver communication back in the other way. There is no reason for the developers to deal with Reddit, etc. The same information can be had on Reddit from my proposed 1-way communication means (no direct posts or interaction from them here, required).
There will always be "haters"; there is no reason to let such people interfere with operation. Do whatever is required to isolate yourselves from them. Long-term sustainable measures need to be implemented, immediately. Why harm your own health and well-being, participating on Reddit or these types of social media? Just don't. Why engage in self-harm? Communicate in a different manner (Gavin has taken to blog posts; you can attempt something similar -- the information will find its way to Reddit, on its own).
In the end, this strategy should lead to greatly enhanced productivity (more code, less futile social media conversations, better health). Entities will decide what code they want to run, based on merit (superior code will be run, as always). Just focus on the code, and reform &amp; enhance means of communication. The rest will take care of itself.

In his talk, he said that there is a risk or fear for having a large / centralized node, by those who want to 'dominate the market', but that in practice the incentives are aligned against it (due to opportunity cost of the money those nodes put up). Only high-velocity routes will be economically incentivized, so Poon theorized that it will be mostly local routing that occurs (neighborhood realm).
His end conclusion was that he is not concerned about it, and that it is the topic of study right from the start.


They are not "going all in". If you do the math, you'll see that LN represents virtually the only possible mass scaling solution for Bitcoin in the timeline of next 5 years. We could shoot up block size, but that will lead to massive centralization. The only decentralized option will be if LN works. Thus, when you say they are "going all in", that is because there is no other option. IMO, everyone should be "going all in", and pouring resources &amp; time &amp; attention to 100% understanding LN's design and helping to improve it and advance it.


So here you're referring to 0-conf (opt-in RBF?) and "jacking up fees" (by keeping blocks conservatively sized? or something else?).
-- 0-conf. is not sustainable or reliable (if it was, we would not go through all the trouble of a PoW consensus system).
There are a lot of cases of businesses losing money from 0-conf. doublespends. It's useful as an option though, and opt-in RBF doesn't remove that (!), as has been discussed to death. The merchant can confirm that user's transaction is RBF or not, and if it is, it can require waiting 1-conf. If not, it can use 0-conf. That's why it's called opt-in... the user makes the decision how long they want to make, and if they want extra usability convenience features enabled by opt-in RBF (refund within ~10 min, etc.).
Opt-in RBF, furthermore, is a miner policy, not really anything to do with user nodes. The miners can &amp; will do what they like in this regard. So, your criticism of Core is totally misplaced and characteristic of the simpleton criticism of lay people. This is why it's troubling to see OB devs saying such things...
Further, the funny thing is 0-conf becomes even less reliable if block size increases at a rapid rate (re C. Decker), since block propagation times would be too high and orphans would occur with greater frequency. In that scenario, 1-conf would be the new 0-conf, making 0-conf *even less* reliable.
-- Now, on to "jacking up fees" (assume by conservative block sizes rather than the voluptuous BIP101 idea.
Again, it's not some mysterious evil Core devs that are singularly responsible. The miners themselves (Chinese + BitFury + others) have roundly rejected aggressive never-ending increases like BIP101.
Further, I can include the point above about orphans and block propagation, for why an aggressive block size proposal is untenable.
There's also the whole argument that the network is not sustainable without miner fees, in the long run. We can't assume BTC price will compensate, so I'm not including that. The network has to thrive regardless of BTC price, and based on things we can control. That means: either 21m cap is removed and we have eternal low inflation, or miner fees take over. Miner fees *cannot* take over, unless there is fee pressure to do so. This is simply about ensuring the system can sustain itself and its security.
If I'm being harsh towards you and the other group-thinkey OB devs, it's because I'm a nobody (really, I'm nobody of import in BTC, just a big investor), and yet I seem to be better-read &amp; understand the issues far more deeply than various big-shot developers (like OB devs). You guys want what the system can't reliably handle (and maintain its characteristics), the way a little child just wants everything and is unable to think deeply or with complexity or reasonably.
Just because it's so easy and possible to change a constant with BIP101, it does not mean it's a good idea! The system is what it is (decentralized cryptocurrency), and it DOES come with trade-offs as a result. It functions exceptionally as "digital gold", but it sucks as a global Visa. Well, it sucks for now, but if LN works, then it potentially can also reliably handle the role of global Visa.

My attempt to explain...
Free space has a habit of getting used. A restrained block size limits that, by placing a fee to reduce 'spam' (defined as transactions that are not economically worthwhile enough to pay an appropriate fee). Setting limit to 8MB means there is incentive for applications to develop to use more space (as well as be less efficient with use of space even otherwise for current uses).
By keeping space restricted somewhat, it incentivizes efficient use of a scarce resource &amp; disincentivizes 'spammy' uses that crowd out the primary use case (p2p electronic cash). All of this is important because resources on the network are limited, and full node operators don't get compensated for providing their service. So, abuse their generosity (via greatly increased block size usage) &amp; expect full node operators to drastically fall.
1MB provides a cap on how much that can happen, which is why it's valuable. Increasing that cap by 8x is drastic. The data shows only 2-3x higher capacity is worthwhile at the present time, and even less if you consider "adversarial scenarios". This is actually relevant and not 'far-out', since BTC is supposed to be 'trust-minimized' -- ignoring adversarial cases means you're relying on there to be trusted actors operating &amp; ignoring possibility of the network being attacked (reckless assumptions to make for something like BTC).

Allow me to clarify, then.
Brian has never even once justified why he thinks BIP101 is better, or cared to address the criticism posited by BitFury, Charlie Lee, and not to mention the other stakeholders (technical experts, aka hundreds of Bitcoin developers who are opposed). He perpetually just repeats a 1-line platitude: "We support bigger blocks" (as if the other side doesn't, which is a lie), or "We think BIP101 is the best way forward".
Is this the speech of a dictator with an overwhelming sense of entitlement, or is that the speech of someone who cares to engage with criticism (aka, opposite of dictator)?
This attitude has continued over the last 6 months, even in the face of massive opposition and increasingly clarified opposition from various entities.
On top of that, he now has the nerve to suggest that he supports XT (led by Gavin as dictator), thereby disenfranchising the hundreds of developers who make up Bitcoin Core (aka, what has constituted Bitcoin development for 5 years).
And, keep in mind the context that this radical indication is made with the prior events still in place. In other words, he has no care that people disagree for valid, technical reasons, and he further inflames the situation by inserting the 'XT coup' into the picture.


Again, I disagree. Brian's arbitrary "deadline" (again, is he Bitcoin's dictator?) was "second week of December" (aka Dec. 7 onwards). When is Scaling Bitcoin  The same time. In other words, Brian wants a decision made at a conference that explicitly forbids making a binding decision.
If he had said "end of December", then there would be at least some indication that he was speaking in good faith (instead of proposing an impossible deadline that obviously will never be met).


Yes, for the reasons I have stated.


I never will understand this. This is a major decision for Bitcoin. Theory is infinitely more important to get right, than "putting into practice". Any monkey can dictate and put a solution into effect; that was never the problem. The problem is finding a solution that is technically sound (has technical agreement/consensus).


I have prove it is true, by recounting Brian's history in this debate. He has shown absolutely 0 interest in debating anything whatsoever.
Further, leaving aside Brian (and his over-sized ego &amp; inflated sense of importance), the BIP101 side has not shown interest in *real* debate. There are many stakeholders (as you can see), who have complained for a long time now about BIP101. Their concerns have not been directly addressed.
People have suggested lowering initial cap from 8MB to 2MB, and lowering rate of growth from 41%/year to something more reasonable, like 20%/year.
This isn't even the point actually. The major criticism with BIP101 is that it sets predictions on a 20-year time scale, and that we don't think that makes any sense (can't predict over 20 years; it's an absurd proposition).

It's not realistic to do both SW + 2MB, even though it sounds like a comfortable "compromise" and a no-brainer idea.
One argument:
SW = ~1.75-2x increase in bandwidth
2MB = 2x increase in bandwidth
There is consensus for ~2x increase in 2016. This means either SW or 2MB, but not both (~3.5-4x increase).
Because SW brings many additional benefits, logic would dictate to go with SW in 2016. Then, after that 1-trick pony is used, block size increase can be scaling mechanism in 2017 (or late 2016, depending on what the timeline looks like, based on 2016's tech improvements).
Make sense?

Let's not forget that it is critical to ensure both:
* short-term health (not unnecessarily having a too-low limit that causes fees to shoot up astronomically), AND...
* long-term health (incentivize miners to secure network)
Disregarding the long-term health of the network is not wise.
I think BIP202 is sort of like a very nice long-term bare minimum proposal (keeps capacity increasing a little at a time forever), as well as a decent short-term plan (rate of change goes from higher to lower, over time, so greater increases in the beginning when it's more important).
Maybe refinements are possible though, so let's figure out how to refine it (nothing is perfect, so let's see what low-hanging fruit is available).

True... but, counterpoint -- wouldn't a LN-integrated-Core have a "proof of stake" (or whatever term) component in that it only earns fees based on how much BTC is locked by that node for LN? So you can't spoof nodes and collect undue reward.
Or is your argument different? By "Sybil the network", if you mean incentive to hyper compete and try to collect all fees, then isn't it bounded by how much BTC the user chooses to lock for LN? Competition is restricted by amount of BTC &amp; opportunity cost of locking that BTC &amp; whether risk of locking it in a hot wallet is compensated by fees or not.
Or maybe I still don't understand the argument?

Keep in mind this could have happened, if Gavin &amp; Hearn were not obsessed with BIP101 or forcing it through via XT.

(cc: u/riplin since you're part of this conversation too, correct me as needed)






From these definitions, it's clear that Bitcoin is a meritocracy. Thank goodness that it's not a democracy.
In a meritocracy, people have "power on the basis of ability". Gavin &amp; Hearn, as experts, have power based on their ability as compared with the expertise of their colleagues. They do not trump everyone else by magic. So, when the expert consensus is not in their favor, then obviously they will be overruled. This is what has happened with BIP101, etc.
When this happened, rather than humbly accept it, Gavin &amp; Hearn decided to try to circumvent the meritocratic system and force their view through, via populism (aka appealing to the various idiots via political talking points, rather than continuing to try to appeal to their fellow 'expert' colleagues).
Unfortunately for them, they have failed miserably, since miners fortunately possess expertise too (by necessity perhaps, since they operate highly technical &amp; highly competitive businesses of their own). The miners did not fall for their arguments, and thus continue to side with the rest of the technical consensus.
Hope that clears things up.

This is how the security model should be, IMO, conservative. If Bitcoin is to be a trust-minimized network that can continue to function in adversarial circumstances, then it's important. Or, we can sacrifice it and reduce the integrity of the network... and trust that nothing bad will happen. But that seems lame.
@_date: 2015-12-30 01:56:42
No, the wallets that don't upgrade will still be compatible. It's a soft-fork opt-in. They just won't send smaller-sized SW txs (so will pay regular fee). Upgraded wallets will pay SW fee (lower). So, there is incentive for wallets to update asap, to have a competitive advantage. This is presumably why 2nd largest iOS wallet will support SW at launch.

Yes. This is the main reason why anyone would want to couple LN and Core together. It finally provides a financial incentive to run a full node.

Well, I respectfully disagree. I could have been less emotional about it (and I've erased the profanities now), but I spoke out because I am seeing a bigger picture here:
* Gavin has done nowhere near the work on Bitcoin that the others have, yet he has a pattern of speaking as if he is responsible for the actually hard improvements to scalability (as opposed to releasing flawed BIP101) that were implemented by others over the past couple years.
* Gavin has built a history of bashing other major contributors (Luke, Greg, Adam, Peter, etc.): accusing them of ignorance, and/or fear-mongering, and/or incompetence, and/or "complaining but doing nothing to solve problems" (see previous point for the blatant untruth of this).
* The BIP101 so vigorously pushed by Gavin for 1 year has been shown to be a 'fraud', basically (as defined by my previous statement -- "your own BIP101 that was supposedly "tested" was just shown (through actual testing) by even jtoomim to be untenable above 3MB, for miners representing 66% of hashrate"). This brings up the question: was it pushed without testing, due to ignorance / incompetence ..or.. due to lack of regard for major parts of the ecosystem / recklessness? Or, why? No explanation I can see is good.
* If it was mere rhetoric and it had no effect, it would be bad, but I wouldn't mind as much. Instead, we are seeing real negative repercussions on Bitcoin (gmaxwell is gone and he's easily equal to 100 Gavin's in expertise &amp; contribution to Bitcoin's future; the BIP101/XT push has fractured &amp; radicalized the community into factions; there is tangible evidence that the XT push has harmed Bitcoin price and investment; etc.)
In other words, the time to let rhetoric slide is kinda over. People love to worship Gavin over his "contributions to Bitcoin", and give him a free pass to say and do what he wants. No one dares speak up against him, as he derides major Bitcoin contributors.
But consider really...
* What has u/gavinandresen actually contributed to Bitcoin in the last 2 years (besides a contentious divisive hard fork, based on a BIP101 that disenfranchises 66% of mining hashrate)?
* And, what have the Core devs he has vilified, contributed in that time?
Answer the question honestly, then tell me about Gavin's "contributions". People need to get real about who is doing the actual work, and who is not. If we continue to reward lack of work with free passes and praise, then it removes incentive from those actually doing the work.

It can work if you: send funds to the wrong address by accident, and want an "undo" or "cancel" option (valid for average of ~10 minutes).
Otherwise, the irreversible nature of a Bitcoin transaction can make it 'scary' to use. Personally, I think this is the best feature enabled by opt-in RBF. I would use it for 100% of transactions, just to have peace of mind that I can potentially cancel a transaction if I make a mistake, or simply change my mind on an impulse buy.
@_date: 2015-12-18 17:26:15


Think about what you are saying. Jeff Garzik released this proposal. Are we not insinuating that Jeff is in cahoots with Blockstream &amp; Lightning developers &amp; others, to help them make more money by "intermediating transactions"? Besides assuming bad faith (which is a no-no), it's also just illogical. Jeff has absolutely nothing to do with the aforementioned entities.
So, if we don't assume bad faith, the reason for being conservative is to respect the Bitcoin network's health and prioritize that health (and security of the network) above short-term gains like unrealistically tiny fees. Those fees are 'miner fees'. They go to the miners to help incentivize them to secure the Bitcoin network. Every 4 years, the block reward halves, so the miners' revenue gets chopped in half. Do we want miners to have financial incentive to secure the network, and care about increasing Bitcoin's health, utility, price, etc.?
So yes, it's important that capacity (supply) increases according to demand, but only to a certain extent. It shouldn't increase to the detriment of the overall network's health.
Maybe, 2MB represents too low an initial bump? Or, maybe 20 bytes/block represents too low a rate of increase? I don't know, but any changes should be reflective of the reality of the rest of my post, and not focus exclusively on supply/demand of network use.
Also! Don't forget SW soft-fork is 100% coming to Bitcoin, so that will, at minimum, multiply capacity (supply) by ~1.75x.
So, this is not a bump to 2MB, but more like 2 * 1.75 = 3.5 MB.

That's what you claim, but meanwhile there is *well-documented proof* to the contrary. I refuse to repeat it over and over, since I've done so endlessly over the last 1 year already. You can do your own research into the numerous proposals put out that increase block size beyond 1MB.


The way you phrased it originally made it seem like you were situating SW as merely fine because it's a pre-req for LN, rather than SW being fine because it comes with a whole host of benefits. That's not true, so that's all I pointed out. It is coincidentally fixing a flaw (malleability) that makes LN less viable, but SW is not acceptable for merely that reason.

@_date: 2015-12-18 18:23:47
Sorry, I don't really know the answer to this question.
Actually, I think I do. SW is not a mere block size increase, although it makes transactions more efficient (thereby increasing capacity by about 1.75x at minimum). Because it implements more fundamental changes, a hard fork would be very disruptive to existing ecosystem infrastructure. For example, the 2nd largest iOS wallet (breadwallet) is not enthused by the idea of a SW hard-fork, but is excited by SW soft-fork. A soft-fork means existing infrastructure will continue to be operational, even if not upgraded; it turns SW into an opt-in.

Segregated Witness soft-fork in April 2016. Current viable block size increase proposals are about increasing size from 1MB to 2MB in 2016. SegWit soft-fork will achieve similar effect via a soft-fork method, along with providing other important benefits.

Can this process be assisted with some new tools? :)
What about literally visualizing the code? Something like designing a 3D model with AutoCad, or whatever software is used these days.
Convert all these terms (like "coinbase's nLockTime field" or "coinbase's string") into a 3D model on the computer that shows each piece's size and arrangement, proportionally. It should also include colored proportional representations of what is taking up space &amp; where.
Then, when new ideas are originated &amp; you're looking for how to arrange the 'jigsaw puzzle', it doesn't require mental representations and 'in the air' thinking. Obvious things should hopefully become more obvious to 'see' (instead of 'imagine'). You will be able to see things physically on a screen, arrange, and manipulate them in 3 dimensions.
Maybe, such a process can even make understanding the block chain easier (therefore accessible to more people, therefore encouraging more development) &amp; help derive even more improvements and optimizations to the code &amp; perhaps more easily discover bugs.
Or, have I simply lost my mind, haha.

Garzik said this because he was not convinced that SW can be active within next 6 months. If SW in fact does become active within the next 6 months, then the effect of SW will be similar to the effect of Garzik's "2MB in 2016" proposals (102, 202). To help ensure this, Core is working to get timetables from wallet providers on their update plans, to make sure SW moves quickly. The 2nd largest iOS wallet has already pledged to adopt SW, as soon as SW becomes active. Further, Coinbase and Blockchain.info (at the least) have also begun the research process into SW. It saves these guys &amp; their users money on transaction fees, so there's really no reason to delay supporting SW as soon as it's active on the network.

I am not a religious fanatic who worships Satoshi (except in the beginning as a fun &amp; innocent thing, but little did I know some people were serious &amp; fanatical about it to the detriment of reason!), nor Gavin because he "received divine authority from Satoshi".

Hmm. I certainly agree about "temporary bridge to better solutions".
Were you implying Lightning? Or something else?
Lightning seems like a good bet. BitFury has informally endorsed it previously, too. We are making good progress on enabling its pre-reqs, and more development effort is being aimed at the Lightning project. If it can be made solid, then IMO that has the best chance of resolving scalability concerns (mixed with modest block size increases, obviously).

u/theymos, how does it work then? Don't just criticize; offer your alternative view. As an aside, there are rarely black &amp; white situations, just shades of grey.
Miners may not hold *all* the votes, but they certainly hold some of them. This is why we are currently awaiting with bated breath the activation of the BIP65 soft fork, as the miners *vote* for it. This is why a hard fork will never activate until, again, the miners *vote* for it.
This is the system, like it or not. Denying it exists does not change the reality that it exists. The rational response, instead, is to try to improve what exists to make it more decentralized.
I also want to defend Satoshi's PoW system. It may be at a non-ideal state of decentralization right now, but the difference here vs. the Central Banking model is that anyone in the world can solo or as a combined force voluntarily participate in the system (mining) to get a vote (plus earn income + help secure the network). It is a completely open system, limited only by the amount of capital committed. It is egalitarian. It's a pure free market.
It is ultimately all about voting. It is a meritocracy. Put forth the best ideas, convince the maximum quantity + quality of individuals of the merit, and the system will change to reflect those values.
(e.g. This is why Adam &amp; Greg are making their case for why privacy is a fundamental human right... and why they believe it is important for Bitcoin. If the ecosystem agrees, then privacy will become part of BTC. If not, then it will be left as an optional part of it.)

These discussions are boring, but a few examples:
1. He advocated BIP101 for the longest time (and still does) as the "coded &amp; tested!" solution. Now, we find from jtoomim (who did the *actual* testing that we all begged Gavin &amp; Mike to do all of this past year) that 8MB is completely nonviable for Chinese miners (66% of hashrate), and that a more realistic number is 2-3MB. This revelation alone (and the context of the claims of BIP101 made in the past year, and the fact that XT's divisive fork was based on BIP101) should be enough to utterly discredit him, if you want to be fair. He was warned that his testing for BIP101 was insufficient by tons of people, and ignored it and gave excuses. When testing is done, it completely discredits BIP101's basis.
2. Read the associated thread's linked post, then read his reply here:  -- And you can also read the replies to him, by me and others. Tell me what you think about his basic reading comprehension ability, and the competence (or lack thereof) exhibited.
3. There's also the fact that, despite the above 2 examples, he has for the longest time berated the other developers repeatedly for "complaining about problems and offering no solutions". He has berated: Maxwell, Todd, Freidenbach, Luke, etc. -- all highly competent and accomplished Bitcoin contributors. You can see his recent berating, Todd's response, and... Gavin's complete lack of response. And, you can judge for yourself whether Gavin's criticism was warranted, whether Todd's reply was justified, and whether Gavin was justified in ignoring the response and not bothering to reply / apologize. --

The issue is increasing "transaction capacity":
* Block size (hard-fork) is one avenue.
* Segregated Witness (soft-fork) is another avenue.
In this case, a soft-fork of SW can be accomplished faster &amp; more safely than a hard-fork block-size increase.
Plus, SW is a priority due to its other benefits. If we can accept SW (equiv. capacity increase of ~1.75-2x), then that is the limit as far as miner preferences in 2016. Adding a 2MB hard fork on top brings us to 3.5-4x increase in bandwidth, which is outside the realm of consensus for 2016 increase.
Do you see this logic?
Simply by this logic, the *optimal* solution is to diligently work on bringing "SW soft-fork" forward by April 2016:
* Do the necessary work
* It has already been tested as a sidechain in Elements, since July. Complete additional testing, as required.
* Work with the major wallet providers to support it (2nd largest iOS wallet *already* has committed to support SW at launch -- I'm sick of repeating myself, but this obviously means that larger wallets can similarly commit) at launch. Core devs are perfectly happy to help with integration, in addition.
This is not really rocket science. Instead of unnecessarily creating controversy, it would be nice if reputable figures worked with other reputable figures, in order to move credible plans forward. And "SW soft-fork" qualifies, as a credible plan.
I would have loved BIP202 or something, but perhaps that will have its time in the sun in 2017.

I disagree. "Small-blockers", "cripple coiners", and other terms were all coined by those so-called "XT zealots". It's not actually true though. Small blockers are sometimes overly concerned (to a fault) about decentralization, but their priorities are in the right place. The point is to keep bitcoin a technology that remains free from corporate or government influence. That can only happen if blocks are kept conservatively sized (to keep sys requirements to run a node minimized, and to keep mining as decentralized as possible). Examine the issue logically, and you should come to the same conclusions. I'd rather be on the side of the overly-careful technical experts in small-blocker land, than on the side of rash &amp; unscientific XT (that tend to ignore decentralization).

Sure, I'd easily choose 8MB and say that is a far more reasonable increase than 20MB. An 8x increase is still large, but of course much less drastic than a 20x increase. I'd love for others besides Luke (who did chime in) to engage and offer commentary on this.

I agree that Hearn's actions have been more indirect (though arguably it could also be seen as direct, in the sense of irresponsibly launching XT to try to 'force'/fork his way via populist appeal before first achieving consensus), but are you implying Peter Todd's actions would actively harm bitcoin? Because I disagree with that.
Read the mailing list post and replies; RBF seems to be much more complex and less clear-cut of an issue than it would appear. My sense is that Todd is looking a few chess moves ahead and considering various consequences (Bitcoin merchant processor mining contracts with 51% of hashrate) of a zeroconf status quo that may harm Bitcoin (decentralization) down the road, and acting to pre-empt it (actually the mailing list suggests F2pool was the one to initiate the discussion with Todd). Further, if not full RBF, then at least FSS-RBF seems to have already achieved fairly wide consensus and endorsement (and F2pool has quickly conceded the point and changing to it).
@_date: 2015-06-09 02:07:30
Actual argument...
**Pro increase:** There is a crisis emerging and we need to act now with a forceful 20x increase to avoid hitting the transaction/second limit! We can worry about the impact on running nodes (keeping the network decentralized) later.
**Con increase:** There is no crisis, let's remember that nodes have been declining, and that nodes will be under further pressure and harder to run if blocks increase 20x. Let's increase it less, and give more time for true scalability solutions to emerge, and time for internet bandwidth to increase so that increasing block size does not make nodes more difficult to run. If it turns out the network is under more pressure with transactions increasing quickly, we can form consensus quickly to raise the block size to deal with it. But, let's not rush into hasty decisions now itself.
Also, comment by 'GreenAddress', which is technically a very sophisticated wallet provider:

Interesting. Right, the 'secure' way recommended now is not to even touch the security card and instead use the smartphone 2fa app, since the card approach is vulnerable.
Regarding the FAQ answer, I found this:


My problem with this is it's not advertised openly by Ledger as a prerequisite for security. Instead, it's made to appear as if simply using Ledger on malware infested computers is perfectly secure.
Further, even this solution is quite technical and involved (1. buy flash drive, 2. download chrome OS, 3. install chrome OS to flash drive, 4. 'enter BIOS and change settings' -- does it even work on Mac??, 5. boot flash drive and disable networking, blah blah blah). How is a mainstream user or even less-than-technical Bitcoin enthusiast supposed to securely initialize his/her Ledger wallet? It seems really impractical.

We both know very well that the nodes I'm referring to are legit nodes, not pseudo-nodes. So, this idea is invalid. It's why I was very careful to say "only between 5-6,000 nodes running for the last 1 year". What matters is historical average, not whether suddenly nodes appear.


That was unfortunate, but it doesn't change the bigger picture. We had about 5-6,000 nodes, and only 10% (maybe 15% at peak) decided to switch. The fact it's gone from 15% at max peak to 10% is not significant?


Pure speculation.


I didn't say 'bad', I said the p2p network has voted in the last 1 year, and nodes + miners have been clear what they want. Now, big guys like Coinbase CEO are trying to throw their weight around, and create drama because they don't like the vote.


Miners say they like it in principle. However, technical experts have now voiced concerns. It's not "useless". Miners can still support in principle BIP 100; it's their right. That's their vote.


Lol, give me a break. Present valid arguments, if they exist, and stop bringing up worthless conspiracy theory.
The goal is not for you to "win" the argument, nor for me to win. Why don't you understand that? The goal is for us *together* to figure out the truth, and promote the truth. I could be creative too, and imagine up 10,000 possibilities why 'BIP XYZ' is legitimate and should have support, but I don't. I try to stick strictly to facts.

How about manufactured controversy? ("SW should be a hard-fork, soft-fork is complicated, hard-fork is elegant, who cares if soft-fork is faster and easier to get deployed and causes far less disruption to existing infrastructure") Don't get over-confident.
People need to not get misled by the SW drama. Most devs like it &amp; most miners like it. It's non-controversial in reality, but certain entities are making/will make it controversial. To counter, the soft-fork just needs to occur asap, as soon as Wuille is ready and the code &amp; testing is complete. Miners can then adopt at their own schedule.

I still think the experience here is far superior to that of other subs, which are infested by XT trolls, who exist only to promote their agenda of XT (&amp; facts be damned).

r/btc is a disaster of a subreddit.
If someone is interested in actual Bitcoin discussion, then r/bitcoin is the place to be.
If someone wants to cry about XT/BIP101/Blockstream/Core and engage in fanciful conspiracy theories and paranoia, then yes go to r/btc.
Observe the difference at any point in time, and you'll see r/btc is worthless, if you want to learn about BTC. The aggressive moderation against XT isn't intelligent or sensible, but it is what it is... and the alternative subreddit is far worse.

Seems like utter nonsense and incredibly foolish. Gavin is not ruler of Bitcoin and the $3.2 billion of value it represents. Many people made Bitcoin what it is today, and Gavin has a responsibility (if he thinks 'wisdom' and 'humility' are virtues) to aim for consensus and not act rashly. If alarmist fools are "pushing him to be more of a dictator", then he should have the sense to resist that "push" instead of allowing the ignorant/emotional mob to inflate his ego.
The more I hear Gavin's arrogance come out, the more I feel he has lost his mind and needs to step down from his position or forcefully be made to step down. I'm having a hard time believing he is still a good steward of Bitcoin, or that he can responsibly handle a position of power.
Gavin needs to gain a sense of perspective, perhaps by looking at great leaders of the past for his inspiration, e.g. the great Roman emperor, *Marcus Aurelius*.

State clearly exactly what financial conflict of interest exists with Blockstream (et. al) in the block size debate, or cease with the libel. You are a regular with endless accusations of impropriety, but I don't believe I've seen a single convincing argument, either logical or factual.
You must have heard this before, but FYI sidechains and Lightning will eventually require bigger blocks; the only difference is the scale of how big the blocks would need to become with (~133MB for Lightning) and without (~24GB) these open-source technologies.

I don't really agree that losing 68% of the cap by default to running a node is a fair tradeoff to ask of users. 80 GB/month = 2.7 GB/day. Just one 2-hour 1080p movie on iTunes (e.g. Chappie) is 4.77 GB. This means watching only 1 movie per day at night plus miscellaneous internet surfing of say 0.23 GB = 5 GB/day, or 150 GB/month. I wouldn't say this is excessive, yet it means the 20MB limit results in having only 53% of the required bandwidth. The only way to counter it would seem to be internet progress, which means node requirements should scale according to that?
I did have an idea though while reading your post! What if a user can set how much bandwidth to allocate to their node every day, based on their situation? This still lacks an incentive other than altruism to encourage people to go out of their way to run a node, but at least it would allay the concern of running a node and devastating bandwidth limits. Each user could contribute what they think is right, and theoretically the number of nodes being run would rise. Even if each node would not run 24 hours a day due to the user's bandwidth restriction, the higher # of nodes would be a win for increasing decentralization of nodes. Maybe. ?

Hi Luke, thank you for being the first one to participate.
However, how is this a legitimate position? The idea of the other side is to increase the blocksize 8x, so proposing to decrease it 0.5x and add a 10% growth rate is not constructive (in terms of proposing ideas that will help lead to mutual agreement). Implemented next year, it would take 7 years solely to return to the current 1MB status quo.
More constructive, in my opinion, would be:
**4MB + 25%/year**
It goes down to the lower bound (proposed: 4-8MB, with emphasis on 8MB), plus cuts the proposed 50% rate in half to 25% (to be conservative, and to address the concern raised here: 
Further, 25% is closer to Rusty Russell's recently suggested rate of 15-17% that is based on his bandwidth growth calculations:

Completely straw argument!
Neither I, nor anyone else, is arguing for "1Mb blocks" nor for "1MB blocks" (there is a difference: 1MB is 8x more than 1Mb).
The proposal currently on the table is SW soft-fork that increases capacity by effectively ~1.75-2x., which has a timetable for April, 2016.


We already have the 2nd largest iOS wallet committing to support SW at its launch. If they can do it, then so can every other wallet larger than them.
And if some stubbornly, or for political reasons, refuse to move (I won't rule out bad faith tactics), then who will suffer? Merely the ones who don't upgrade, lol. Those who upgrade will be essentially running on a network with 1.75-2x higher capacity (since their tx sizes will be smaller), while the non-upgraded will be limited to a lower capacity and higher fees.
In other words, all the incentives are aligned for wallets to upgrade to SW, asap.

That's true. Would it have made their operation more difficult though? Insurer wouldn't be happy to have to cover the loss, so next time insurance cost would be higher.
The intangible side of it also deserves mention. The trust of consumers, investors, businesses, traders, etc. would be shaken by such an incident, since Coinbase has a reputation of being the 'gold standard' of custodial Bitcoin companies (and even Bitcoin companies in general, whether deserved or not).
Overall, it seems it's a matter of priority for industry to stop holding on to customer funds (or at least, eliminate existence of their hot wallet, and become purely cold storage-savings-based, with spending hot wallets controlled by their customers). As Nick Szabo pointed out, and as is becoming clear, "trusted third parties are security holes".

My parents and all my relatives can be classified as intellectual elites and, but to a lesser extent, as financial elites (net worths each less than $10 million). Yet sadly, and it pains me to say it, none give a fuck about Bitcoin despite either gentle or passionate proselytizing (educating). The existing system serves them far too well, so there is simply no reason they need to care. Their reaction is more along the lines of: "scam", "ponzi", dismissal, 'politely smiling', befuddlement, worrying if I'm 'okay', etc. Their interest is more to be conservative with their money than take any risks. This all held true even when I attempted a demo by sending $5 (maybe I need to try $500,000? lol). Their opinions seem to have been entirely informed by the media ("Oh bitcoin? Yeah I heard it's used to buy drugs...").
Not saying you're wrong, but I think the sample set that adopts Bitcoin first is going to be defined more narrowly than that. To hazard a guess, either the media narrative needs to consistently and universally change and/or the price needs to surpass the previous ATH (to deliver some intangible/tangible 'credibility').

But, none of this matters and it's all about Blockstream and their "financial conflict of interest"?

Sure, but this is relatively easy for miners to do, given how centralized mining has become (not saying good or bad, it is what it is).


Can't comment, don't know enough. But if so, agree that would be bad.


Aaron Voisine of Breadwallet (2nd largest iOS wallet &amp; SPV) disagrees (he thinks hard fork is bad &amp; soft fork much better):
* 
I'm still also interested in your response to this (relevant piece is summarized below):
* 
SW soft-fork will, at minimum, double effective capacity. Yes, bandwidth usage will not decrease, but capacity would nonetheless double. I argue this does represent a 'short-term scaling increase', or no?
A doubling of capacity should be good for another 1-1.5 years (until early-mid 2017) of projected demand (until IBLT / weak blocks / etc. are designed, tested, and implemented -- to allow for safer hard fork for larger block size), according to TradeBlock's research:
* 
* 
And, lots more valuable research is here:
* 
In other words, short-term scaling concerns resolved for 12-18 months. Once IBLT / weak blocks / etc. are ready (hopefully in next 3-6 months?), then hard fork for block size increase can occur. Lightning can also be simultaneously developed (a testnet version is estimated to be available in 2-3 months), in order to help amplify the effect of any increase, such that a lower block size increase is required than otherwise.
In other words, a roadmap for the scaling problem to be solved with proper consensus of a super-majority of all categories of the ecosystem.

Come on, u/theymos. You know very well that full nodes are no magical construct. In the end, ideas + merit wins, not an arbitrary classification by one group. I believe Core has that credibility and competence right now, but if Core someday screws up and loses the public trust, then people *will* switch their nodes elsewhere. It hasn't happened yet, because in fact, Core maintains legitimacy (regardless of what some others prefer to think).


Sure, and the network security meanwhile will also turn to dust, and be vulnerable to attack. Price will plummet, meaning objective value in the system will plummet. The system, in other words, will become useless and worthless (objectively more useless and more worthless than it was while under the theoretical 51% attack).
Also, you're forgetting the fact that a true malicious actor can even prevent that algo change you're referring to. I won't mention exactly what I mean by that, but we talked about this 1-2 days ago. Again, if we don't like that system, that's because the system is not yet perfect or ideal. The cost of that attack *does* need to be raised very significantly, to make it as difficult to perform as 51% mining attack at least.


Are you referring to me? I hope not. No, I don't mine, and I never made any threats here (?). Don't take what I said personally? I'm speaking from an observational point-of-view.
Also, this remains vulnerable to what I explained -- in response to your last point (in this same post).
I think you're underestimating that Satoshi purposefully designed Bitcoin as a system impossible to control. It really is a meritocracy and a free market. Neither you nor I nor anyone else really has control over it. The world, collectively (supermajority), has equal say.
The incentive to make it work (and not fall apart in anarchy) is the assumption that users will act in their best interests (highest BTC price), and that those interests, in aggregate, will align to form a supermajority. It is a system based on 'greed', but greed harnessed to lead to a positive end result (free market concept).


Huh... how do you justify that? Literally, BIP65 becomes possible to use at 75% acceptance over last 1,000 blocks. It becomes mandatory after 95% acceptance. This isn't a "signal of readiness" like the block size voting (bip100, bip101, 8MB, default) is.
* 


I'm interested in hearing more about that. I'll just point out though: even if it's theoretically possible, the system will either: 1) be rendered worthless (price-wise, which is the only objective measure of value), and/or 2) be vulnerable to a malicious actor that wants to force its will over the system.
In other words, Core doesn't have a divine ability, to be the only entity that can try to force its will. So, you better hope such a power does not really exist, and that the free market (via PoW) is ultimately able to assert itself. Otherwise, Bitcoin is yet another closed-access system like Central Banking.

Are you aware that 20MB means 170 GB/month or 5.7 GB/day of bandwidth is required per node? My Comcast cable 105/10 Mbps service has a data cap of about 250 GB. 170 GB is 68% of the cap, leaving me 80 GB free in a month for my regular internet activities. That is insane... and so I would never cause my effective cap to drop to 80 GB just to run a node.
This is the main problem with the 20MB block size increase. My internet service is much better than most people's, yet even I would not be able to run a node.

Yeah. How to achieve that though? I think it's easier said than done. There's a big problem with how to have an independent entity that vets implementations and verifies them.

Yes... it isn't every day we get legit research posted, and for review no less, by relatively unknown parties. The paper is also a very nicely written summary of the literature, and can be useful to help others understand the concepts in context :)
I know you didn't write Maxwell's paper, but do you know what security level is assuming in his confidential_values.txt document? In his SF Devs talk, he mentioned that level of privacy is determined by the size of range proof used, but I didn't pick up anywhere how many bits of security is assumed by a 32-bit value requiring 2,564 bytes.
Your CCT idea involves 230 bytes for 128-bit security. Is this also for a 32-bit value?
Knowing the answers to these questions may help compare and contrast a little better.
Finally, does the security level refer to the difficulty of cracking the encryption (how many "bits of entropy"), while the level of privacy in CT and CCT are both the same ('absolute' privacy of transaction amounts)? Also, is the privacy protected by the security level (so that if the encryption is cracked, privacy of the transaction amounts disappears)?

The problem is that one side wants the best solution and is working to create conditions to arrive at it. Meanwhile, the other side (Coinbase CEO, aka Mike Hearn behind the scenes + Gavin) presented BIP101 nearly 1 year ago, and aggressively pushed it as the only good solution. That side was never interested in debating it. Coinbase CEO has pushed it since April or so. In other words, Coinbase CEO has been a pure dictator since the beginning.
I am absolutely appalled that the above state of affairs is being supported, and especially by people like you who own Bitcoin businesses. Does acting in a meritocratic manner mean nothing? Clearly to Coinbase CEO, based on his actions, he could not care less.

I would be very careful before making such assumptions. Look at how altcoins have turned out. I agree, if things get very bad, then at some point the only alternative is either a fork, or an altcoin (perhaps bootstrapped by BTC block chain snapshot), but you only need look at success (failure) of altcoins, to see how difficult (impossible) it is to achieve any real traction or success.
Working from within the system seems like it would have a higher chance of success (again, unless the situation is so dire that it's impossible to have meaningful impact from within, and only if there is a concrete comprehensive plan with buy-in from a significant portion of the ecosystem players to join the fork/alt -- in other words, only if chance of success is realistic &amp; can be actually maximized).
Just imho.

Interesting observation, but from the posted article:


@_date: 2015-12-30 19:36:00


No worries Erik, thanks for the kind words.


There are short-term solutions + medium-term solutions + long-term solutions.
SW does a lot of things. One thing it does is provide a short-term solution (approx. for 2016 by my estimate) for scaling. It is especially short-term if it's done as a soft-fork, since soft-forks can be deployed more quickly + are safer.
* Also, breadwallet has already committed to support SW at SW's launch. I've argued this before, but the obvious logic that follows is --&gt; If breadwallet can do it, then so can any of the larger wallets. This means capacity can increase fairly quickly. Companies have 4 months to test and work on it. If people stop complaining and start working (the Core devs are happy to help with integration), then at launch, SW can result in increased capacity. There is no need for long lead time before SW takes effect. There is incentive, further, for wallets to adopt SW quickly: lower tx fees + higher capacity.
BIP102 is the approximately equivalent block-size-increase version of a short-term solution.
Medium-term solution is something like BIP248.
Longer-term solution is something like BIP202.
Yes, we will be having the same discussion again later, about how to best scale Bitcoin for the longterm. This is not by choice, because it's fun to debate scalability, but because of technical realities. See Greg's bitcoin-dev Capacity Increases post and the FAQ for more color, but simplified: tech improvements need to occur, before block size is further increased. Otherwise, the inevitable result is further centralization which is anti-thetical to Bitcoin's success.
To reiterate, SW is not meant to be a long-term solution. It is a can-kicker, just like BIP102, and just like BIP248. It is something being done, since no good alternative is currently available. But, tech improvements in 2016 will pave the way for larger block size increases. No one is against block size increases or hard forks. The point is to do them safely, when the tech can justify them.


Yes, for all intents &amp; purposes. I've explained why in a simplistic manner; more details are in the original bitcoin-dev post &amp; FAQ.


That part is less clear. It depends on the pace of progress of what I've simplified as "tech improvements". It's the same position as BitFury, basically. They had an excellent metaphor that was like: If you jump out of an airplane, you have to make 100% sure the parachute works before you jump. Similarly, when tech improvements are ready for deployment (Greg was optimistic about their progress in his bitcoin-dev post), then block size increase can be considered. (quoting from FAQ: "IBLT and weak blocks may allow for safer future increases to the max block size.")
Make sense?
Ultimately, everything has to do with technology. I understand people are impatient, but people's lack of patience is not a reason to abandon technical merit, and act for the sake of acting. Right? That is no way to run something security-critical like this, and I don't think that is how Bitcoin Core has operated in the past either.
Let me reiterate the roadmap for readers, which lists some of the many scaling-relating things being done (since increasing block size is a single item, and the simplest thing to do -- yet not the wisest first move to take):
* 
There is so much more to scaling Bitcoin than increasing block size. I think that is the biggest point to hammer in.

No offense, but your reasoning makes little sense to me.
* Based on current estimates, LN will be deployed by end-2016 (none of this "5+ years").
* SW = increasing practical capacity from ~2.3 TPS to ~4.0 TPS. That's about 75% increase, or after taking other things into account it may come to about 100% increase (2x). No one is saying SW can come out "tomorrow" -- estimates are about 3 months. Real transaction demand (ref. TradeBlock) is projected to hit 2.3 TPS capacity by mid-2016. Of course, you can do the math &amp; see that SW's deployment will occur in time, and be sufficient until early-mid 2017.
* In the meantime, a hard fork block size increase plan can be discussed / implemented (increasing on-chain supply), plus Lightning should be becoming active (reducing on-chain demand).

He basically acknowledges that bigger blocks will reduce # of nodes, but only estimates max 50% reduction and thinks this will only have a tiny effect on security/centralization, and hence that the scalability benefits outweigh it. He is also saying he is open to good arguments that show a more major effect. I guess that's pretty good, as far as I'm concerned. At least he is being reasonable.
It would be nice if everyone opposed to bigger blocks could read that post and reply to it, and provide those major arguments if they exist.

Observations from the Presentation today on RootStock...
Okay, the presentation is over. A few observations:
* the talk was generally well received
* the use cases mirror that of Ethereum, the system will include a "backwards compatible" version of the EVM, allowing existing contracts to deployed on this chain as well
* there will be no additional creation of tokens, rootcoins (RTK) are 1:1 convertible to BTC
* the separation of concepts is not nearly as clean as the Ethereum vision (Whisper, Swarm, Blockchain)
* neither the talk nor the whitepaper made any indications of the state of the implementation
* certain functionality requires a hardfork of bitcoin
The worst case for the Ethereum project and stakeholders would be a complete devaluation of Ether and an externally controlled imcompatible fork. It could end up like Plan9 did because of Linux: Another system was there, it worked and was more popular, although its foundations were more efficient, elegant and future oriented. While the first scenario (devaluation) is reasonably possible, the second is probably not, as they claim to support Solidity and other parts of the existing development infrastructure, which the foundation could support. The foundation may even get voting rights.

He said this:


It's not trivial that a node will go from needing 8.5 GB to 170 GB (equal to 5.7 GB/day). Most internet connections come with data caps of about 250 GB on average, or less. Having to spend 68% of your cap just for 1 node seems absurd, compared to the prior 3.4%. This is like making the choice of running a node and having a cap of instead 80 GB, rather than 250 GB. I can't possibly rationalize this, which means I'd likely never run a node.
The 20x increase in bandwidth also means 33 KB/s download and upload, but this is much more minor.

20MB is a non-starter to a highly significant minority. Ignoring them, or pretending they don't exist and sidelining their views, is not constructive.
This finally emerged yesterday and could be a starting point toward actually getting consensus:


As seen in the link, Gavin himself finally compromised the arbitrary 20MB route, with the options of 4MB + 50%/year or 8MB + 50%/year, and said these alternatives will be fine. So, this is where we should be starting the debate now.
More on this preliminary debate, here:


Also, here's some good reading material from GreenAddress, which summarizes the various camps and the complexity of this debate. GreenAddress has arguably ıeen one of the most creative and security-solid wallet implementations in existence since the beginning, and they have a very good technical grasp of the protocol that exceeds that of most wallet developers:

Good possible argument. If people know the cap is at a certain size and the current transaction rate (and how we are at ~50% capacity), then it could be plausible that applications which may otherwise occur are being foregone. I have not seen any evidence of this in practice, though.
As an aside, I urge you to please continue making logical arguments like this, and do away with the blockstream-centric theories. The former is far more constructive and helpful than the latter.

Thanks for confirming.


Yeah, that's what I think too. The incentive is aligned with their adoption of SW as quickly as possible. It's sad, but most wallets are with centralized processors: Coinbase, Circle, Xapo, etc. It will be trivial for them (and they're incentivized to reduce the tx fees they pay) to upgrade all their users to SW since it's a centralized system, so I would expect adoption to occur rapidly.
It would still be nice to get statements from the wallet providers on their timelines though, right.

Unsubstantiated, conspiracy theory nonsense. If this guy cared to do any research to help base his theories on facts, he'd quickly realize it's not just Blockstream Bitcoin core devs opposed to raising the block size in the manner it's being proposed. You can add Garzik, Todd, theymos, Wladamir, Harding, and others to that list... none of whom work for Blockstream. And if that's true, then the argument falls apart.
Of course, I'm not even getting into the other available evidence that shows this argument is clearly not as simple as Blockstream wanting to obstruct, simply to profit from their layer 2 projects (i.e. Lightning). Lightning did not even originate from Blockstream but from Joseph Poon (it's just being funded by Blockstream to address Bitcoin scalability), and was endorsed by Gavin. This post is a gross oversimplification, and it's shameful that u/jstolfi would make such a poor argument. It makes one think he has an ulterior motive, or at the least that he is reverting to his baser r/Buttcoin instinct.
@_date: 2015-12-01 22:05:38


Bitcoin itself is unpredictable, too. So what? Do we stop using Bitcoin because we can't predict how long a transaction will take to confirm? (No.). Do you deny that a user will have, on average, ~7 minutes to cancel/undo a transaction? If not, then I think average ~7 minutes is enough time for a user to gain value from being able to undo/cancel. It's a huge improvement over the current reality (no recourse, once a transaction has been made).


How is it not a pressing issue? I already explained in previous posts (and in this post too now) why it's a big issue. Irreversibility is nice in some ways, but it's also very user-unfriendly. I feel paranoid every time I choose to make a BTC transaction, due to the irreversible nature. I literally triple check everything, before I move forward. If I could reduce that fear, it would be worth a lot to me.


There are lots of informed minds that disagree (including Garzik: "tl;dr Good stuff. It is "opt in" as implied."), so I fail to see how this is true. People will always disagree about things. It's about whether, on balance, something is good or not. I've read enough to know there are plenty of people who think it's a good thing (very "benign" compared to what it could have been).

They of course have zero direct say, but indirectly it can help, as they do note down customer issues and customer requests (as a quality customer service rep should do). So, being one of hopefully many other customers who are requesting a certain feature (Bitcoin support, in this case), it certainly cannot hurt and lets Google Wallet's team know there is demand for the feature.
I don't get into a half hour lecture on Bitcoin, just a 1 minute mention of: asking if Google Wallet supports Bitcoin, then, when they either say 'no' or don't know what it is and act confused, letting them know briefly what it is and expressing how it would be great to keep all my bitcoins in their custody. Simple as that.
P.S. I have never called solely re: Bitcoin, just as an adjunct to whatever other technical issue I was facing. Also, believe it or not, one time the rep was very familiar with Bitcoin and eager to talk about it casually. That one call ended up being about 15 minutes long, but only because the rep wouldn't stop talking lol.

So there is less latency using Bitcoin-XT? What impact does this have, practically speaking, and how does it achieve such a consistently lower latency vs. Core?
@_date: 2015-06-08 07:01:19
It's a lower price/customer, sure.
Under the micropayment model, we can estimate: $0.01/article * 10 articles/day * 365 days/year = $36.50/year per customer.
This is less than the $273/year per customer rate right now.
As of 2013, WSJ Digital had a measly ~900,000 subscribers.
We can understand that micropayments offer up much less resistance for the consumer to pay. So, instead of 917,000 micropayers, we can estimate at least 10x, or 9,170,000 micropayers.
$36.50/year/customer * 10 = $365/customer under micropayment model, if we consider the numbers relatively on a basis of equal number of customers in both models. This is 33% more revenue, and probably more after subtracting WSJ's fees to payment processors.
These models probably have room for improvement, but the point is higher volume is expected, which will more than make up for the lower cost/customer. And of course, if WSJ thinks it can make customers micropay $0.05/article due to their "high quality content" instead of just $0.01, then they can increase revenues 6.7x, not just 33%.
@_date: 2015-06-09 23:07:29
The math is incorrect:
20MB up AND down = 20+20 = 40 MB every 10 minutes
40 MB * 6 = 240 MB every 1 hour
240 MB * 24 * 30 = 172,800 MB = ~170 GB/month
And yes, it only applies with 100% full blocks, but we don't have real research in this debate to inform us of what to really expect in terms of the rate of block size increase. Because of this, and because 170 GB/month is really excessive, a 20MB increase doesn't seem advisable. We need to address the research concern, at least, so we have hard data on what to expect and can model better.
@_date: 2015-06-09 02:44:08
I'm not saying that, of course. Obviously the masses' (users') opinion matters. However, it is simply a fact that the coders understand the complexity of the matter more than the users do. Why am I saying this? Because they have written the Bitcoin software, which involves meticulously considering at every turn how they are affecting the incentives (economic, game theoretic, and otherwise) involving miners, users, developers, nodes. Users just use the software and read superficially what they come across. The people (coders) who are actually writing the software are 'applying' what they have read and learned in practice. This makes them more of an expert on the matter.
I don't think it's politics at play. Those against the 20MB increase are against it primarily because of the effect it has on increasing bandwidth required to run a node, by a factor of 20x. This is virtually the argument, summarized in 1 line. This argument is not political, but a matter of keeping the network decentralized by allowing the max number of people possible to run nodes. Nodes decide what rules the network follows, so they are very important.

SW increases TPS, hence it does help the scaling situation. It also comes with a lot of ancillary benefits, hence why it's much better than a mere block size increase.


Correct, it's not. We are on average at 60% of capacity. And?


Whoever made the claim that it would? SW kills many birds with 1 stone, but optimizing block propagation is not one of them. That's where IBLT, weak blocks, etc. enter the picture. Those things are not yet available, which is why anything extreme like BIP101 is dead on arrival to 90% of hashrate.


That's nice rhetoric from u/gavinandresen, but estimates nonetheless put SW soft-fork deployment at ~3 months. If we stop wasting time debating pointless crap, like "let's have SW hard-fork instead", then maybe we can even expedite the 3-month estimate.

I'd argue the practical limit is currently 2.3 TPS (200,000 transactions/day), based on: average transaction size + confirmation-time of 1 block.
A higher TPS rate risks transactions taking longer than 1 block to get 1 confirm, which means a backlog would be building (demand &gt; supply). Even worse, the confirmation time would increase exponentially, beyond 2.3 TPS. (TradeBlock reported on this in their research on block size trends.)

I agree with everything, but I think an increase (either BIP202 or SW) needs to ideally occur before mid-year. Demand is unfortunately growing faster than expected, so the circumstances are changing. We will get wiggle room, due to large hashrate increases helping to compensate, but that's not something to be relied on (every 2 weeks, difficulty adjusts -- unless hashrate increases get spaced out and occur at a good tempo, it won't be appropriate can-kicker).

cc: Very interesting to know! This aligns a lot more with what I've read about adoption rates for apps, and devs' preferences for iOS vs. Android.
By the way, have you considered integrating bitcoin into the actual game, so that mining for example generates real bitcoins (in amounts as small as satoshis if that's what it takes), which can then be withdrawn to a user's wallet (either a user's outside wallet, or the wallet could be created within the game somehow: maybe a wallet hosted by Coinbase or ChangeTip or Xapo can be integrated)? Such a change would really take the game to the next level, and let players actually earn real bitcoin (however small) with their 'mining' efforts. It could be a major selling point of an update.
Something along the lines of Sarutobi (iOS), or this new iOS game:
I'm sure the dev of the above games (could help you make progress on this task quickly, since he already has experience working with Xapo and Coinbase to integrate bitcoin within those 2 games.
As far as a funding source for those bitcoins (or satoshis), has also apparently figured out that issue too with his 2 games. And if it turns out it doesn't apply to a game of the scale of Bitcoin Billionaire, I'm sure a solution can still be found even if it requires the community's support... though, of course, a self-sustaining solution is best. Also, this may provide ideas:

The OP didn't delete the post; a mod did, probably because the post was inappropriate ('hijacking the Greek referendum').
Regarding your points, it's true to some degree, and everything is possible I suppose. I think I'll only disagree that it is so easy to co-opt the mining network. The reason is that a race to build up hashrate will be obvious in the mining stats, and the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem will react to it and presumably mitigate its impact.
Actually, I'll also disagree that Greece will have so much ability to back the network. The population is only 11 million, while the existing Bitcoin network is ~5 million. Greece should be able to migrate to Bitcoin without too much effort. Creating an alternative network on the other hand, and backing it, will be difficult because, as it is, there is very limited cryptocurrency talent around the world. Most of what exists is already part of the Bitcoin ecosystem, as it was the first cryptocurrency to be developed. This may present a problem for an independent national currency looking to be developed.
Regardless, the current network could not be used by millions of Greeks on a daily basis, since transaction rate is too limited. So, Greece will have to wait either way for some more development! We'll have to see how it plays out.

Instead of acting arrogantly, you could plainly state the facts as did, and maybe even include references to substantiate them and provide extra reading material for those interested.
Keep in mind that everyone here, believe it or not, is not a programmer nor software developer nor expert in Bitcoin's technical underpinnings (e.g. something like the full implications of "pruning"). And that's perfectly okay. It will take people with many different skills to make Bitcoin a success, such as design, marketing, management, operations, customer service, etc. Software developers are one tiny piece of the picture. Without the rest of it, Bitcoin can and will easily remain the tiny niche that it is today.

I suppose: It would take 1 year before it's even possible to happen, since that's the plan. Further, like you say, miners can mine whatever size they want. If this is all the case, then the argument against raising the limit is lowered, I suppose.
I welcome anyone more knowledgeable to jump in and answer this, if there is an answer.
The only argument that comes to mind is: that nodes still must process everything, both 20MB and non-20MB blocks. So, even if every block is not 20MB, nodes must be capable of it, and so will still be impacted.

I understand your frustration, but if you read the opposing side's arguments, their arguments are also legitimate. Both sides make good points. The challenge is to efficiently work through the various arguments and come to a compromise.
Basically, it is not a good idea to just rush into a hard fork situation where a large minority (especially a large minority with the brainpower that it has: people like Adam Back, Greg Maxwell, Luke, Rusty Russell, and others) is forcefully left behind. I would say this is *far worse* of a situation, than one in which the increase is delayed until an emergency situation arises that forces a quick increase with full consensus.
I think yesterday's 'consensus forming' thread shows that we are making some progress here: down from 20MB static increase to 4MB/8MB + 50%/year.

I just don't agree though. I've taken the time to read through posts and posts, among others, and they make seriously good arguments. These arguments are what you describe, as in "big picture" and certainly not the "stuck in a small world" type. They are laser focused on what Bitcoin truly represents (the 'freedom'/disconnected from the system/politically independent/decentralized/cypherpunk aspects), and I think are providing a valuable service by arguing that side so we don't lose sight of this big picture.
For example, read this post:
* 
Further, they have shown themselves to be perfectly willing to accept a hypothetical 20MB blocksize, and help implement it "within days" if an emergency situation arises that makes it obvious they were wrong in their projections and that 20MB is required.
Please take the time to explore exactly what they are saying. I previously read Gavin's blog posts with a dead mind and complete agreement. But, after reading the opposition's posts, I have realized this is a much more complicated and nuanced discussion and both sides (especially the anti-20MB Greg Maxwell, Adam Back, Blockstream side) deserve equal respect.
We need real consensus and compromise. Discarding the anti-20MB view is simple, yes, and the easy way, but it's absolutely harmful to Bitcoin's longterm success. Gavin's dismissive attitude lately in how he replies to those who disagree with him is furthermore disrespectful and not constructive.

You are sending money that was unconfirmed. The previous transaction, in other words, has not been confirmed yet:


Not sure why. It's a pretty huge transaction size. Is it from some sort of mixer? Still, the fee/size ratio is not too low, so it should confirm sooner rather than later.

All of the rest of it makes sense, but can you clarify this point?




This almost seems like a general weakness of human nature. People don't like to admit they are wrong. They prefer to either be defensive, or take offense and go on the attack, when confronted.
I think in the West, there is less concept of black &amp; white "right &amp; wrong". Everything is open to question. Everything is open to argument. There are endless arguments as a result, as each person's "opinion" is considered something that must be "treated with respect", even if that opinion is objectively false. (Though to be fair, there are probably some form of pros *and* cons to *both* types of culture -- but it is what it is.)

I have to disagree there. It's not an altcoin. It's also not, as is deceptively labeled, "an alternative implementation that improves diversity" (i.e. like libbitcoin, btcd, etc.).

What is the implication of this, as far as end-result TPS capacity goes? For example, we currently have 2.3 TPS capacity (assures that every transaction has high chance of being confirmed within 1 block, which seems a reasonable metric for a high-performing network). With what you've said, we would achieve 2.3 * x -- so what is that "x"? :)

Hmm, well I suppose I could agree. But, the reason why I'm reluctant to is this: how many of the members of the community understand the point I made above? If they did understand (and it's a simple argument, so I don't see why they wouldn't), then why do people still fervently support 20MB blocks and denounce anti-20MB-ers as having an ulterior motive (zOMG it's Blockstream members and their sidechains business!) and trying to subvert or harm Bitcoin? Where does all this uncalled for passion and conspiracy theory come from?
I'd propose the reason is they don't understand how important the role of the node is in Bitcoin, and thus how important it is to keep the running of nodes as decentralized as possible. Someone who writes the Bitcoin Core software (the node's software) and understands the technicals of how the protocol works will deeply appreciate the various incentives that make the system work. This includes appreciation for the importance of nodes.
If one understands the bandwidth argument, along with the importance of decentralization of nodes, then one will argue one side or another much more gingerly, instead of being full gung-ho for one side. However, most people are not arguing like that, which is why I think there is a difference in opinion between the coders vs. the users.
@_date: 2015-06-12 22:01:19

@_date: 2015-06-14 03:20:36




Ehh, $2.30 per transaction? Bitcoin has been universally advertised as being a system for 'free' or 'almost free' transactions, including micropayments. How can we suddenly decide it's okay to pay $2.30/transaction in fees? It sounds quite extreme, and it would eliminate many use cases and ability to use bitcoin in the majority of transactions.
While we can debate the merits of this change and ultimate effect, I don't think it's tenable to make a change of this magnitude when the absolute vast majority (99%+ probably) has forever imagined Bitcoin as powering the world's transactions. So, it would be realistic to forget such a notion and compromise here to keep fees at a reasonable rate to maintain the original vision, say max $0.10 or something psychologically low. There will be no support from anyone in the ecosystem for anything else, so a different way to solve the problem would have to be found.
Not to mention, there is historical evidence that Satoshi himself did not envision Bitcoin in such a way:


Basically, it's untenable to change this, on many different levels. The idea is just too attractive to be able to use Bitcoin to "finally send money for free anywhere around the world", in comparison to the "usurious banks and credit cards and remittance services". This is the established narrative... for better or worse.

Stop with the conspiracy theories. Decisions are made on technical merit, not on politics.

awemany, Are you referring to the miner's soft fork ability? If so, then it may be a concern to leave miners with that ability. Also, lifting the hard fork cap "opens Pandora's Box" per se to the higher cap. The fear is if it's possible, then the blocks will get filled (with spammy transactions) and reach the new cap quickly again. That would put us right back in the current situation where we want to raise the cap, except with the negative of lowered decentralization (of nodes).
For the record, I'm against "extremists" who want 20MB or nothing, but also against those at the other extreme who are being too fearful of moving past 1MB. I've voiced concerns of higher caps in the past, but raising to 4MB (or even 8MB) surely is not the end of the world, and as the common refrain among core devs has gone, I think these sizes are "within safety limits", yes? Even if we lose some nodes on the margin, so what? Practically, it seems completely minor.
e.g. A quick calculation of  full 8MB (assuming node is on 10 hrs/day, 2.26 GB data/day consumed by node, and half of bandwidth reserved for node) shows a 1 Mbps download connection is sufficient to handle it. So, everything less than 1 Mbps would be under too much strain to run a node. Is this really the end of the world? Am I missing something else?
A point to make here also is that the Bitcoin network is not just a science project, but the ecosystem is also a real and functioning business. In business, practical decisions need to be made. One can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good, and make bad business decisions (whether that's refusing to compromise, or not acknowledging a solution that is best for *all* stakeholders). Ideals are great, but ideals mixed with a practical mindset is best and, really, required here. This is no longer a small science project where conditions can be maintained to perfection. Based on the previous paragraph, my back of the envelope calcs seem to show 8MB is not the catastrophe it's being made out to be, and that the tradeoff is worth it due to increase in potential user adoption and resulting expansion of investment and developer interest).
Am I wrong, and why?
@_date: 2015-12-24 16:00:52


And this is the whole point of it. Block size increase is irrelevant. The point is to increase capacity at a reasonable rate (whether by SW or by block size) that is compatible with maintaining a decentralized network.


Citation required for the alleged "conservative estimate"...
Breadwallet (2nd largest on iOS) already said they will support SW, as soon as it's available. Ditto for Ledger. Other competent wallets will either follow quickly, or they will lose market share because their users will have to pay higher tx fees than users of wallets which upgraded.


That does not mean it wouldn't be *quicker* and *less risky* to soft-fork, which are the priorities. People are welcome to keep trying to stall roll-out, but it won't work. But they're certainly welcome to keep stalling, just like Mike tried (and failed) to stall CLTV by arguing it should be a hard fork.

I agree with this, and I'm highly opposed to the tone Gavin has lately been taking in responding to people opposed to 20MB/XT. It's been unprofessional, dismissive, arrogant, and perhaps even a bit disrespectful.


I'm not much of an 'expert', and this topic is extremely complicated. But speaking off the top of my head...
'Security' would seem to depend on:
* # of nodes
* # &amp; hashrate of miners
* # of users of Bitcoin
Each factor is impacted by multiple variables and they interlink, making it more complicated. But simplifying, these variables would be best geared towards a secure network, if decentralization was maximized, right?
Max decentralization would seem to mean:
* highest # of nodes
* highest # of miners &amp; hashrate as equally split between them as possible
* highest # of users
Users could possibly be maxed with a system as useful (frictionless) as possible: in other words, as free and unencumbered by the 'traditional system' (laws, regulations, rules, etc.) as possible, so as to present the greatest possible reason (benefit) to partake in the system.
This lack of friction is made more possible with a system that maximizes security (aka resistance to the 'system'). This now seems to circle back since, as mentioned earlier, security is maximized by maxing (via increasing decentralization) node count and miner count.


I guess the answer to this lies in the previous stuff happening, as this will then lead to an increase in transaction fees for miners as well as a higher exchange rate (price/bitcoin). These two things would compensate for the block reward halving every 4 years.
@_date: 2015-12-01 00:26:56
Meh. Decisions should be made on technical merit, not "economic majorities" throwing their weight around. It's in the interest of the "economic majority" to get the best technical solution implemented (plus for all the other reasons I discussed).
@_date: 2015-06-18 19:03:02
A miner would '[want to] fill the extra space with bogus transactions' in order to gain the extra transaction fees yes, but where would the miner find these transactions? The transactions would have to be legitimate and have a fee attached in order to benefit the miner at all. And if those transactions are legitimate, then it only means there is a lot of demand to transact on the Bitcoin blockchain, and that surely cannot be seen as a bad thing. Right?

To be clear, I've shared this link for the purpose of truth-seeking discussion, not for blind ideologically-driven advocacy for one side or another in the block size debate.
It includes a common refrain that gets thrown around:


But, to play devil's advocate, is this really true? In the context of 'Bitcoin vs. Fiat', does a less decentralized Bitcoin (one in the context of 20MB blocks vs. 1MB blocks) really lose its fundamental properties?
* Does it stop being sound money? (no)
* Does it lose its censorship resistance? ('maybe' -- depends how centralizing 20MB blocks are, but again I would lean towards 'no' based on my calculations -- also, if Bitcoin ever became centralized and truly corrupted, then it would be forked and one would simply run the fork with 'sound money' as the utility; so this possibility would serve to lessen chance of corruption of the protocol after centralization)
* Does it lose its irrevocability? (no)
* Does it lose its quality of being a cheap form of payment (and by implication, function in micropayments)? (no -- obviously not, since bigger blocks means low fee pressure as block size will be made to scale with transaction volume -- further, Lightning and similar solutions will guarantee cheap payments)
These value propositions differentiating Bitcoin from Fiat are from the article.
Another may include:
* Open-source, programmable, extensible money (no -- Bitcoin does not lose this property with an increase in block size -- further, Bitcoin will never lose this fundamental property compared to fiat)
In summary, I'd like to suggest that the article reminds us not to lose sight of what makes Bitcoin Bitcoin, but that it's alarmist in the sense that I don't see how Bitcoin actually loses any fundamental properties via increasing the block size. The increase proposed (20MB) and the follow-up revisions to the proposal (4MB, 8MB, market-based miner-based block size scaling, etc.) are within the bounds of maintaining a certain degree of decentralization. So, Bitcoin absolutely does offer something that is not offered by its competition (and to extend the argument further, various aspects will continue to be offered regardless how centralized it becomes).

There are major problems holding back new users. Bitcoin is still a largely 'beta' product, and is nowhere near mature in terms of usability and security.
Even 'mainstream' wallets like Circle and Coinbase, while pretty and simpler to use and 'insured', come with the subtle disclaimer that insurance only applies to issues affecting the company's servers (hot wallet) and cold storage processes. Any loss due to security issues resulting from user error or the user's security being compromised (infected computer, phishing, etc.) is not covered by insurance.
Given this, how can a mainstream user desire to use Bitcoin vs. traditional finance which places no personal responsibility requirement upon the user? It's not ready for mainstream yet, but maybe hardware wallets (once mature and mass produced) will be the answer.

As to the validity of Nielson's Law, this link's graph seems to show that it's a valid estimate of growth of bandwidth:

But, I'd personally be more comfortable taking a conservative approach (assuming a lower growth rate), since Nielson's Law is based on growth of "high-end" connections. If we can cut it in half, it's still growth of 25%/year, which seems fair (near Rusty Russell's recent estimate of 17%/year).

(cc: u/justusranvier check out u/maauk7's post about 'arrogance' - parent of this post - see what you think)
So, from my POV, I can understand all this, and support it.
However, back to the real world...! :)
Is there room for compromise? Scale can be rationalized and argued as important to let that social transformation occur (Adam Back has used a term that escapes my memory, like theoretical security vs. delivered security -- theoretical = tiny block size, but few users ..vs.. delivered = somewhat larger, but many more users). In that vein, is it possible to accept this, and have a compromise between ideal development priorities (privacy, decentralization) vs. masses-demanded priorities (scale)? Life is not something with absolutes. It's essential to be flexible. I don't know if this kind of argument can get through to the types of developers attracted to Bitcoin, though.
BTW, I'm not including people's concerns like [this]( or [that]( when I talk about "masses" -- I mean masses that are a tad bit more informed than that. For the aforementioned, I don't know what to say. No hope, I guess?
Another issue I notice... is you make the situation with developers appear very fickle or temperamental. I hope the developers are resilient, and recognize that there are plausible scenarios in which enemies of Bitcoin may try to stir up drama or chaos, to force this situation to occur (development to unravel). There needs to be measures to keep development immune to the drama to some extent (and maintain morale). Miners can help with that, by acting as a buffer (like Chinese + BitFury are doing). I hope the businesses can also understand the value in a truly decentralized Bitcoin too though (people like Balaji, 21, Andreessen Horowitz, and other enlightened companies or VCs), and be friends in the effort to develop it. In the end, they only gain real utility from Bitcoin if it remains censorship-resistant and decentralized (Circle CEO's stated vision from today's blog post cannot occur if this is not true).

You did not answer my question. Show me where the *financial* conflict of interest exists.
Both technologies are being developed in an open-source, inclusive model with all code on GitHub. Supposing that tx's move off-chain to LN (or the alternative duplex micropayment channels recently revealed) and SCs, which is inevitable btw to ensure instant tx's and vastly higher throughput by 10,000x, how exactly does Blockstream stand to exclusively benefit financially?
And btw, don't say "consulting services"; these are not proprietary closed-source products so Blockstream has no exclusive lock-in, as I previously mentioned.

I disagree on the implication that 170 GB is trivial; see this as an example:


And the suggestion that 50x demand increase will result in plenty of new nodes sounds nice, but is there research backing it up? Just as easily, one could argue that 50x increase in demand will largely come from know-nothing mass consumers, and so running nodes will be the last thing any of these new users would consider doing.

Also, don't listen to naysayers; this 'convoluted solution' allows a merchant to accept micropayments and only wait max 8 seconds for processing. BlockCypher requires only 8 seconds to have 99% confidence to guarantee the transaction. If a merchant can accept payment with bitcoin in only 8 seconds, this makes microtransactions viable since the customer does not have to wait for ages until the payment is confirmed in a block. This is valuable.
Their work is partly an implementation based on this research:

I don't think it matters that Larry Summers said this. What matters to me is *what* was said.

I strongly believe both sides have legitimate concerns, and thus that the only reasonable answer lies in *compromise*: for example, something like 4MB increase or 8MB increase.

If I had to guess why, I think Brian subscribes to Hearn's worldview. He seems to have been religiously reading Hearn's blog posts. I realized that after I investigated Brian's tweet history and Coinbase's tweet history.
Hearn's posts have been highly critical of Core, of specific Core devs, of Blockstream, and basically of everything about that side. Hearn recently said in an AMA that Bitcoin can only survive if "Core is killed". Lol.
If you keep that context in mind, then Brian's public statements &amp; actions over the last 6 months are quite unsurprising. Those words &amp; actions are that of someone who does not respect Core devs or think they have credibility, IMO.
I think it's also now quite accepted in the community that Hearn's behavior has been 'toxic'. Perhaps Brian needs to re-evaluate his faith in Hearn, and thereby try to look at the overall situation more objectively and fairly (which isn't possible, if he's wearing Hearn-tinted glasses).

Just one idea (being worked on full-time and funded by the evil, corrupt, ulterior-profit-motive *Blockstream*, mind you) is Lightning.
There is wide consensus among Bitcoin developers that it is viable and can work. By Rusty Russel's (the guy working on it at Blockstream --  admission on his blog:


By the way, have you even read the Lightning whitepaper draft? I see you commenting with all sorts of factual errors that Lightning will only allow scaling by a factor of 10x, when in fact the scalability offered is rather on the order of 10,000x.






@_date: 2015-06-09 19:31:03
Extra bandwidth requirement, since it takes more bandwidth to transmit 20x more data (20MB vs. 1 MB).
@_date: 2015-06-09 20:50:50
Regarding incentives for nodes, if the limit is kept at 1MB, then transactions will eventually fill up the blocks completely and there will be increasing delays for transactions to be included in blocks. There are peaks and troughs in normal activity, but eventually, even the troughs of activity won't be enough to take care of delayed transactions.
In this situation, I'm not sure nodes would behave differently. The 1MB limit would be static either way. It's extra effort to run a node though, even at only 8.5 GB/month or 283 MB/day. Besides understanding the importance of nodes and altruism, there doesn't seem to be much benefit.
So, a incentive structure is probably the best way to address the issue regardless of block size, right? But apparently incentives can result in problems too, and I haven't thought enough or read enough to really speak on it. Surely there must be an intelligent incentive structure to address concerns though! I can't believe that no sustainable solution exists.
In terms of miner soft limits, yes, they can modify the ultimate block size. However, the issue with block size is bandwidth demand's impact on the ease of running a node. I'm not sure this relationship is easily related to the exchange rate, but rather to the intangible benefit of 'decentralization' of the network, making it more resistant to possible bad actors. It's more of an amorphous idea, so we probably need it decentralized as an overarching goal, to help keep the network strong as possible 'just in case'.
@_date: 2015-06-09 19:56:57
The argument is not to change anything, actually. The argument is status quo, leaving it as is, or changing it less than 20x. The reason why is because 20MB is not a final solution. The real solutions are still being developed (lightning, payment channels, sidechains, etc.). So, the increase should be more modest to reduce the demand placed on nodes.

However, BitFury has so far shown themselves to be very fair, balanced, objective, analytical, and sophisticated in the depth and breadth of their research regarding the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Of course, other miners are expanding too: I think 400-600 PH in next 3-6 months. If so, BitFury's share may end up around 35-45%.

I really don't understand your arguments at all :|.
Is it possible you are allowing your financial interest (presumably from what I've read of you, your sizable bitcoin investment) to cloud your judgement, by making you excessively anxious about problems (e.g. scaling)? And, thus inclined to want to support the most direct and quickest way to increase scalability, regardless of possible negative longterm consequences (like reduction in decentralization of nodes due to increased bandwidth demand)?
The reason I present this idea is because I don't understand what you're saying...


Yes, and so what if it is complex? It's complex to you and me, but to these people (cryptographers, software developers, cypherpunks) and due to their level of intelligence, this is a normal day's walk in the park. Bitcoin software is also incredibly complex, which is why there is such a big 'education gap' for anyone looking at it for the first time ( Its complexity is not a logical argument for thinking that something is concerning...


Blockstream specifically is funding open source development of literally the best technology to have emerged in the last year, which provides real hope that scalability can be finally solved (20MB does not cure scalability woes, it only postpones the issue). In other words, they are investing their own resources to promote software infrastructure development that will not provide them with direct financial benefit. In fact, their sidechains work itself is open source and free for anyone to tinker with and help develop and run. This also represents actual Bitcoin infrastructure investment. What other company or entity is funding such Bitcoin work on scalability (Lightning) and extensibility/experimentation (sidechains)?
Relating to the previous point, did you note the release of 'Confidential Transactions' prototype, via the talk's PPT slides, the .txt document, and the video of the talk? I'd advise also exploring this thread and the linked paper within to understand it better:


So yeah, what did you think of CT? This is a direct Blockstream application of sidechains to allow testing of the first major improvement to Bitcoin (which can be integrated into Bitcoin as a soft fork when mature): Real privacy of transaction amounts... obsoleting merge avoidance and privacy-focused altcoins like Dash/Monero/Bytecoin. The transaction graph is not affected by this and was not featured because it disrupts pruning and scalability (its functionality could theoretically be included though by having a cryptonote sidechain or darkcoin sidechain that resets itself periodically to avoid pruning issues, that bitcoins can enter into to obscure the transaction graph).
The implication is that Blocksteam's money and brains were instrumental to creating CT, and thus resolving a weakness of Bitcoin (privacy, fungibility) that is often parroted around. This one thing alone (ignoring Lightning, and sidechains in general) is enough to eliminate the competitive advantage of privacy altcoins (and privacy altcoins proposed the only advantage anyway; the rest of altcoins do not offer any real new technology). So to summarize, we can say that Blockstream has helped to enhance Bitcoin's competitive advantage (against privacy altcoins) and increase its viability for use in the real world (by seriously improving fungibility) --&gt; both of which help secure its future, thereby increasing its investment value (exchange rate).
I can't honestly think of any other person or company or entity that is directly contributing to Bitcoin's core development more than these guys (comparing Gavin/Mike to these guys is laughable), which is why I'm baffled when I read what you're saying.

Why is it necessary for you to use a credit card, though? The bank account integration allows a much higher limit ($2,500?), so if you really want to buy more at a time then that would be the way to go.

Agreed; it's not feasible to revert on the now-widespread vision of Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency and payment network with global access and low fees. However, we are currently averaging only ~1.3 TPS (see:  -- look under 'mempool'), so there is actually no immediate crisis.
That said, a little larger buffer (perhaps 8MB, since agreement seems to be coalescing here from the various parts of the network, including miners), to account for a sudden spike and buy time until true scalability solutions are developed, is sensible.
I'm agreeable to 8MB, but not 20MB, as 8MB is a far more palatable increase. Both block sizes would mean a trivial increase in node bandwidth requirement (a few tens of KB/s in download/upload bandwidth), but represent a significant difference in total data consumed. Per month, 1MB blocks means 8.5 GB, 8MB blocks is 68 GB, while 20MB blocks is 170 GB. Given my ISP-imposed data cap is 250 GB with a 105/10 Mbps connection, it would be dreadful to have to consume 170/250 GB monthly just for 1 node; in fact, this would be completely unviable and I'd be forced to discontinue the node. In contrast, 8MB is a good compromise, as 68/250 GB/month is far more bearable.

* Charming art/interface
* Charming music
* Nice animation (zooming in/out) while monkey is swinging, to bring a sense of perspective
* Way, way, way too many advertisements; after every single monkey launch, you are brought to either a Genesis Mining ad, a request to buy a t-shirt, or a random popup 'special' to buy 500 bananas. It becomes annoying to see it this often and this consistently. I understand you need a funding source for the tips, but even choosing a random interval between 1-3 (meaning an ad will display either every 1 round, or 2 rounds, or 3 rounds) each time would be better. The randomness would 'feel better' since it's not so predictable (what I mean: maybe ad would show after the round, then the player plays 3 rounds and sees nothing until the end of the 3rd round, then the player plays 2 rounds and sees nothing until the end of the 2nd round).
* The popup 'special' for 500 bananas really feels 'scammy' sorry to say, since you're not being awarded 500 bananas for free but rather being asked to buy them, which doesn't really qualify as a 'special' circumstance, right? So it's a misnomer.
* It feels like the game is a missed opportunity as far as displaying the power of bitcoin goes. If you use BlockCypher's Microtransaction API (coincidentally I posted about it today, see the front page of you can send microtransactions as small as 20 bits (~0.5 cents), and the first 8,000 transactions are free (they will pay the transaction fee). Further, they guarantee these microtransactions with 99% probability and speed of ~8 seconds. After the first 8,000 free transactions, the fee will range between 5-10 bits. All this is accomplished via BlockCypher's proprietary 'Confidence Factor' calculation. So, what can you accomplish by using this? I received a 110 bit tip (normally only 55 bits) for my 10 coins in SaruTobi, and was told I'd receive it within 24 hours. This seems a bit of an understatement of Bitcoin's power. Instead of this arrangement, why not send tips 3x more often at 20 bits/tip, instead of a 55 bit tip, and send them super fast within ~8 seconds. This would increase player satisfaction since the instant gratification factor would be increased.
* Another Bitcoin idea: Is there a way to utilize 'payment channels' like in Streamium.io? For example, one idea could be to use its per-second nature to reverse the experience of Streamium (send bitcoins to the player rather than charging the player bitcoins), so that you tip the player micro amounts of bitcoins in the 'foreground' ('foreground' meaning an in-game counter is incremented, either as time goes on or via some other game mechanic.. maybe banana accumulation?), and after reaching a certain threshold, say the BlockCypher 20-bit minimum, the payment channel concludes and releases the tip in the 'background' ('background' meaning via the actual bitcoin network) to the player. The advantage is: continuous instant gratification from accumulating bananas/coins, yes, but also the expected monetary reward, instead of only accumulating bitcoins by having to luck out by hitting coins.
* The gameplay could also be improved: 1) It's often the case that bananas/coins are located just a bit too high from the ground, so even if the monkey skids on the ground, the monkey won't come into contact with the item. This is frustrating. The items should be lower so the monkey does hit them rather than passing underneath them. 2) General placement of items could be arranged better so that the monkey collides with more items, instead of on average when I played only colliding with 1-4 items. 3) Also, it may be better if the monkey can bounce a bit, so that when it hits the ground, it bounces back up and hits more items. 4) There should ideally also be a way to buy a bitcoin tip with bananas. This is sensible because bananas are gained through playing. Playing more means viewing more ads. So, incentivizing playing the game more means more revenue for you, which means bitcoin tips can be shared more. Connecting say 100 (or whatever is fair) bananas with a tip would be a good way to incentivize playing more.
* I'm a little concerned that Genesis Mining (cloud mining) is being advertised. It's generally known that cloud mining is a scam. Why not try to advertise some more legit services, like news (CoinTelegraph, CoinDesk, etc.), wallets (Coinbase, Circle, Airbitz, Breadwallet, etc.), exchanges (OKcoin, Coinbase Exchange, BitFinex, etc.), or something else similar? There would seem to be no end to legit services that could be advertised :)
Overall, quite a nice game. I'll just emphasize again that, besides fixing some of the sharp edges to make the experience more pleasant and addictive, try to research ways (like with BlockCypher, and payment channel tech) to better make use of Bitcoin's power. This alone would be an asset for the game by 'wow-ing' players, and thus differentiating your game vs. the other million games in the App Store. I was genuinely excited, while playing and imagining ways it could be 'perfected' to enhance the experience.
I'm actually encouraged to myself experiment with designing an iOS game using micro-bitcoin rewards as the addictive incentive. This seems like the first time a game can actually share advertising revenue with players. Instead of collecting meaningless coins (like in Sonic), the player can collect 'coins' with real value, albeit micro amounts that add up over time. Collecting those 'coins' means tiny shots of dopamine, not just from collecting coins, but also from knowing one is accumulating actual money at the same time.

No contradiction. I said gmaxwell said he expects full consensus (&gt;95%) in that situation within days.
And yes, the precedent so far has been to wait for &gt;95% consensus, so why change the rules now? Gavin did make his own argument within the BIP for why he chose 75% (regarding some sort of miner attack mitigation I think), but I haven't read enough into it to judge that reason.

The idea is that this unlocks the door, and the ultimate conclusion is now foregone. This helps mainstream cryptocurrency by allowing the original (Bitcoin) to rightfully assert its supremacy, and slowly begin further concentrating development effort onto it, instead of needlessly diluting development, funding, public attention, branding, communication, etc. with what are theoretically endless variations of altcoins that have zero legitimate reason to each use their own token. Well, there did exist a legit reason (Bitcoin could not be modified in every different way), but the advent of sidechains now invalidates that argument.

This claim is utter bullshit. If you disagree, then please do clarify here and now exactly what financial conflict of interest exists. I hear this specious claim of "financial interest" repeated ad nauseum by random people here as if it were fact, yet I have not seen a logical or factual argument that backs up this FUD by actually detailing the exact nature of the financial interest.
Blockstream's projects (sidechains and Lightning) are both completely open-source and being developed in an inclusive manner with public mailing lists and public GitHub repos. Hence, anyone can help develop these projects, anyone can host Lightning hubs or create sidechains, and anyone can gain expertise in how they work in order to provide 'consulting services' for those wishing to use these projects in the future (I mention 'consulting services' because this is the only financial interest I've seen mentioned, by Mike Hearn). Blockstream does not have exclusive access to these technologies, by which they would be able to exclusively understand and profit from them.
Anyway, provide me with a sensible argument and I will immediately and gladly change my view on this matter.

@_date: 2015-06-09 02:14:27
That's where we disagree. I think it should be avoided *at all costs*, especially since *most* of the experts are against the increase, including Garzik. Gavin and Hearn are essentially the only core contributors in favor of a massive 20x increase in block size.
@_date: 2015-06-02 06:29:24
Chun Wang of F2pool later said:


... in response to Gavin's agreement to reduce his position, from 20MB blocksize to: 4MB + 50%/year, or 8MB + 50%/year.
@_date: 2015-06-03 03:04:22
And so, because there are so many ideas, the solution is: Forget all those people and all those other ideas/solutions, and let's just charge forward with the 20MB route, with or without consensus?
Sorry, that's an asinine approach, and I'm certain we can do much better. As seen in the link, Gavin himself finally compromised the arbitrary 20MB route, with the options of 4MB + 50%/year or 8MB + 50%/year, and said these alternatives will be fine. So, this is where we should be starting the debate now.

Okay, but consider the impact of bigger blocks (like the 20MB proposal):


Higher fees suck to some extent, but what if fees only increased from 0.25 cents to 2.5 cents. It's a 10x increase in fee, but the size is still tiny and the decentralization of nodes is maintained.

@_date: 2015-12-18 18:38:17
It doesn't, does it?
Without SW, this means block capacity rises from 1MB to 2MB, then increases annually at a decreasing rate over time. With SW, this means block capacity rises from 1MB to ~3.5MB, then increases annually at the same declining rate over time.
Either way, the % is determined by BIP202.
@_date: 2015-12-01 21:07:20
Nope, I have never been of that view. You can cite it if you like though? I regularly criticize theymos (for banning XT and the way he handled it by saying 90% of users can leave if they want, for threatening to ban Coinbase, and now for threatening to ban Bitstamp). At the same time, I might have said I think theymos represents the best of the various options available (but that does not = "extremely pro theymos").

@_date: 2015-12-09 21:07:27
Hmm, Gavin, maybe we can also request u/nullc 's view on [this]( regarding: how long it should take for SW to be rolled out &amp; enter into effect (in terms of: increasing effective TPS capacity by 2x as a short-term kick). -- 12+ months, or what?
I'll also ask you &amp; u/nullc...
* If it would take 12+ months for SW, then: is it sensible to *asap* roll out something super simple, like BIP102 (or even BIP248), in the interim? As a "short-term solution", to: grant time for SW to become in use + allow the other things I mentioned in my prior post (pre-layer 1 like IBLT/weak blocks + layer 1 + layer 2).
Let's also keep in mind TradeBlock's helpful projected 'demand' increase schedule, when we discuss adjusting the amount &amp; rate of supply increase:


@_date: 2015-12-07 14:20:35
It was heavily implied, considering nothing else has been proposed or released, so you're merely arguing semantics.
In XT land, "scaling" is synonymous with "block size increase" to achieve "VISA!! ^in ^20 ^yrs ".
It is all Core that has been suggesting different ways to scale.

@_date: 2015-06-13 17:17:36
I found a really good comment by Gavin:


He basically acknowledges that bigger blocks will reduce # of nodes, but only estimates max 50% reduction and thinks this will only have a tiny effect on security/centralization, and hence that the scalability benefits outweigh it. He is also saying he is open to good arguments that show a more major effect. I guess that's pretty good, as far as I'm concerned. At least he is being reasonable.
It would be nice if everyone opposed to bigger blocks could read this post and reply to it, and provide those arguments if they exist.
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:59:45
Sorry, Mixlez, I did jump the gun on my criticism (partly due to being influenced by finding this research [apparently mistakenly moved] on the alt-coin section of bitcoin-talk!), so I've deleted the original comment to reduce the noise in the thread.
Let's abbreviate Confidential Transactions (CT) and Compact Confidential Transactions (CCT). I've read over the paper in greater detail to try to find the 'compact' aspect of it. Is this it, in essence: per transaction, extra space needed is 230 bytes (CCT) vs. 2564 bytes (CT), so 11x less? Also, does CCT not require the use of Borromean ring sigs?
You mention the tradeoff is that dust transactions can no longer be rejected by the network, so a mandatory non-zero fee will become required, in order to implement this. I feel this is not too much of a concern, since increasing amounts of on-blockchain transactions will necessarily increase fee pressure, thereby making 0-fee transactions impractical anyway. What kind of non-zero fee do you anticipate being required?
Thanks, and I apologize again for the prior misunderstanding.
@_date: 2015-12-19 16:09:05


Good point, but even that scenario isn't realistic, in the slightest. Is Gavin suggesting "transaction creators" (like you or I, for instance) start mining rigs worth 1%, as you suggested? Unless Gavin is suggesting everyone use his employer, Coinbase, for their transactions, the scenario does not make sense. Am I missing something?


Yeah, this was the main point, and it was explained quite clearly in the post. I'm not sure how it could be missed.
@_date: 2015-12-01 00:38:08
re: Video
My point was JPM's CEO feels that way about Bitcoin. JPM is one of the largest banks of the R3 consortium. Banks' business model is threatened by a world involving Bitcoin, since Bitcoin represents an alternative financial system. Obviously, R3 is not interested in seeing Bitcoin succeed.
re: Coinbase
I mentioned patents, because the situation ended with the community basically taking Brian's word for it. That was fine then, but now we learn Brian wants to take over Bitcoin development (via Gavin &amp; XT). Suddenly, it's difficult to assume good faith over the original patent episode. Hence, it's now an issue again (IMO).
In terms of monitoring transactions, yes they must follow rules. I cited it since if they control the protocol, they'll undoubtedly be under pressure from the very same government to "control" the protocol's development in a government-friendly manner. In other words, a high chance of their policies seeping into the protocol itself, rather than being relegated to their bitcoin bank.

I don't know the answer to your question, but marginalizing and mocking the developers who have helped make Bitcoin what it is today is pretty foolish, if I may be frank. Wladamir, FYI, has made the most commits to Bitcoin Core, with 2,700+. Said another way, let's see you put in the back-breaking work that Wladamir has for Bitcoin, then you may have the right to implicitly mock him (and the others).


@_date: 2015-06-09 02:25:12
Agreed with the clarifications.
Regarding 2), I'll add that those who say "no increase at all" or "decrease the block size" are just as extremist as the "raise the block size 20x" folks.
I'm advocating a sensible middle ground that represents a real compromise between the two camps, and thereby takes into account the legitimate concerns of both sides.
@_date: 2015-06-25 01:39:53
I think you're missing the point, Greg. "PR battles" can be won with the truth, if it's stated clearly enough and given visibility. I think what you're trying to say is, "If logic and truth cannot win out, then Bitcoin cannot work" -- correct?
Luckily, the truth usually always does win. However, if you hope to "win" an argument, then you must make sure that whatever is done is enough to make the truth clearly visible to all stakeholders. It's called "advocating for your position" and there is nothing wrong in doing so. The point is all stakeholders must have a clear grasp on the options, and you are your own best advocate. Please avoid taking a fatalist perspective :).
You're doing a great job participating in Reddit and, if you'll notice, there is a clear shift going on little by little where the community is gradually beginning to take a more nuanced position on the debate, rather than going with the seemingly obvious "bigger is better" position. Not only Redditors, but also miners are finally entering the debate in a restrained and wise manner. Just please make sure that the issues in the debate are clear to *all* stakeholders, not just Reddit (the 'users') and miners.
Evidence of censorship (Paypal, Visa, the recent Voat.co issue, etc.) also helps to reinforce to the community the perils of a centralized payment system (and hence what Bitcoin must ardently fight against becoming -- though of course the current 8MB proposal is not by any means going to lead to that level of centralization, to be fair). 
Also, let's get LN, sidechains, and/or that alternative duplex micropayment channels LN-alternative solutions out and in the wild! These are what will ultimately solve the scalability problem in the most decentralized manner after all, and effectively end the obsession with infinitely bigger blocks.
@_date: 2015-06-28 20:36:19
Thanks for the detailed post; it was insightful. However, I have two points to make:
1. This thread is about "Provistor", which seems to do exactly what you want (make it easy to start a store without having to download, install, and run OB software -- further, it looks like it's free for an individual who wants to open only 1 store). See this 1.5-min video for a demo: 
2. You express concern about OB taking too long to launch. This was a volunteer-driven effort though for much of its history, so what else is one to expect? However, the good news (why I linked that thread to you) is that it is no longer this way because OB was funded 2 weeks ago by Andresen Horowitz and Union Street Ventures. Thus, the devs can now work full-time on it and more hires have been made (a designer, etc.).
@_date: 2015-06-07 04:21:46
Great news.
@_date: 2015-06-25 03:08:44
Always good to quote the Architect, but here is added nuance to his thoughts (2.5 months prior):


This was from mid-2010, but now in mid-2015, we are currently at ~6,000 nodes, only 6% of Satoshi's stated "over 100,000 nodes" threshold for network decentralization.


@_date: 2015-06-03 00:36:03
It's probably better this way. I don't think Bitcoin can handle a $350 billion company 'backing' it and not lose its founding ethos or have its development coopted to serve Google's commercial goals. Without Google, Bitcoin can grow in peace developed independently by developers who will more easily be able to stay true to the big picture idea behind Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-22 02:09:21
Worrying, why? What's so worrying about it? SW soft-fork, regardless of your preferred scaling solution, is an incredible advancement for Bitcoin. It needs to be deployed ASAP (for scaling, and also just for everything else it offers: fraud proofs to create "super SPV" wallets to enhance lite client security... comprehensively solving malleability attack vector... script changes to make future improvements easier).

OP, why on earth did you use a random wallet like "BitWallet"? Aren't there already time-tested, proven apps available on iOS, like breadwallet?
Sorry for ranting now, but I can't for the life of me understand why people treat their wallet without the utmost seriousness, considering it's real money they are dealing with. People 1) First choose wallets like they are choosing what kind of outfit they want to wear (regular comments on wallet threads are: "Oh, this '[insert: no-name or bad-name wallet like BitWallet or Bither or blockchain.info]' wallet looks so cool; I don't use breadwallet since it uses lame 'bits' and has that funny 'b' logo", and then 2) Panic when something unexpected happens, as if something unexpected happening was not a foregone conclusion, considering the choice made in step 
@_date: 2015-06-22 22:28:20
But of course, it must be done in an Apple-esque manner (high focus on UI/UX) to make it intuitive and abstract away complexity.
@_date: 2015-12-02 03:33:56


For example, sometimes it's ambiguous if the address being copied is the right one. I had to get an address from Circle's app, and it was ambiguously situated. I was very anxious about the transaction (worth thousands of dollars) the whole time, to the point that I sent a test $1 transaction first.


Fine, then wallets can have dual settings, organized in a user-friendly manner. Something like: "reversible transaction" (min. 1-conf., RBF) or "instant transaction" (0-conf., non-RBF)

The link you cited does not say anything about 12-month estimate for roll-out.


A bandwidth increase of 2x (segwit) * 2x (102, 202, or 248) = 4x. They are only comfortable for now with 2x increase, which also is the level of increase that miners support.


Yes, thanks for reminding me. Unbounded validation meaning diff. of 30 sec vs. 10 min (20x), for 1MB vs. 2MB, respectively, if I remember correctly.
Can you clarify what "simple guards"? The proposed solution I remember is VCM, which is in the pipeline for 2016.

@_date: 2015-06-13 15:44:03


I kind of disagree here. Let's not make generalizations. Maxwell proposed 2MB, Luke proposed 750KB, and not sure about others. On the other hand, I haven't seen responses to 4MB + x%, or 8MB + x%. But we are seeing response to jgarzik's 'alternative' idea, so that's good.


What is the reason then? Cost of running a node equates to the decentralization concern, so if not that, then what is the argument? I think part of the issue is a minority has 'extremist' views where it's all-or-nothing in their minds, which of course is not how the world works (nothing is black and white) nor how progress is made.

How are you thinking of tackling that?
I asked earlier about r/JoinMarket integration (since the order book has great liquidity and it's a truly decentralized CoinJoin implementation -- I actually don't know of a single other service that's comparable or available or tested / peer-reviewed to the same extent), but didn't really get a specific reply.
I'm also confused why ShapeShift is being included, since ShapeShift policy is to log IPs and address linkages &amp; involves a 0.5-1% fee to convert 1-way (vs. JoinMarket's 0.001% or lower fee). That defeats the point of using SS for privacy purposes. Or am I missing something?
@_date: 2015-12-01 22:20:47
So I agree with all that, to some extent, but I have to take issue with:


It sounds good in theory. But, some people dishonestly make the claim that we need to "decentralize governance" in conjunction with promoting "XT". XT does not decentralize governance; XT aims to replace the governance of Core/btcd/libbitcoin, with its own governance (Mike + Gavin calling the shots). I agree it's positive to actually decentralize governance/development though, so as to reduce leverage or too much feelings of power among any one group (inevitable feelings that may arise over time -- possibly what led to resistance to properly discuss block size-based scaling, initially).

By untenable, I mean 66% of hashrate ("Chinese" miners) is unable to handle bandwidth requirements associated with block size higher than max 4MB (more realistically 2-3MB), due to the GFW. The miners themselves have also stated they do not want more than ~2MB in 2016.


Notice "RN", "VFM", etc. are terms that basically equate to --&gt; trusted 3rd party (TTP) issues. It means miners are not verifying blocks by themselves, but outsourcing that verification.
Nick Szabo has repeatedly criticized this:
* 
In fairness, u/jtoomim noted that criticism and intelligently did not run biased tests with such "optimizations" in place. He ran the tests conservatively, the way the network *should ideally be running*, as opposed to the somewhat precarious state it is in today.
@_date: 2015-12-18 16:43:22
Good, IMO there's nothing really wrong with the pace of increase (from estimated bandwidth technological increase point-of-view).
It doubles (100%) in 6 months to 2MB, then increases 50% in year 1 to 3MB, 33% in year 2 to 4MB, 25% in year 3 to 5MB, 20% in year 4 to 6MB, 17% in year 5 to 7MB, 14% in year 6 to 8MB, 12% in year 7 to 9MB, 11% in year 8 to 10MB, 10% in year 9 to 11MB, 9% in year 10 to 12MB, and so on...
Every year, the increase % gets less, so it's quite conservative in that respect (and the increase % quickly becomes less aggressive, as opposed to BIP101's constant 20-year 41%/year increase, which seems to disregard long-term miner health).
This also matches the idea of keeping miner fee lower initially (speedier block size increase), but gradually making miner fee more important (slower rate of block size increase over time), since it's required to incentivize miner security (with higher fee) as block rewards decrease.
It's like a more conservative version of BIP248, so it is somewhere between BIP102 (bare minimum) and BIP248 (BIP101-schedule of 41%/year, but less aggressive initial bump, &amp; short-term). BIP202 is almost like a more realistic and appropriate (and perhaps it's even more conservative at latter stages) version of BIP103 (appropriate 17%/year increase [it also increases in perpetuity, I think?], but kicks in too slowly... &amp; initial growth maybe too slow to handle expected initial surges in demand in these early years of Bitcoin network growth).
Still, it might be nice to wait for some discussion to occur and more opinions to be given, since the proposal is very new. So, a 'letter' could be postponed while feedback is given, since maybe some more refinements are possible.
@_date: 2015-06-19 22:56:43


Look, I respect your knowledge and expertise in this matter, and that of your colleagues at Blockstream. But, this recent trend I have noticed, of threats to leave Bitcoin and/or cryptocurrency in general because things may not happy perfectly as you wish, is frankly childish and insufferable. No one gets 100% of what they want; we learn this while we develop as children. Further, nothing is ever permanently lost in such situations. There are always creative solutions to be discovered that can ameliorate compromises that were made.
Making threats does not advance one's cause and lead to a good compromise from which something can be built; it only detracts from it in the public eye by showing one's immaturity. Hearn was wrong with his confrontational approach to the debate (as the community has slowly recognized), but so are you guys for making various provocative and inflammatory statements.
You may think you are acting very principled and claim you are "fighting for the cypherpunk vision," but fundamentally, ideology does not win debates nor lead to success in the real world. Realistically, good ideas are found everywhere and the truth lies somewhere between two extremes. e.g. Satoshi, who was the one to actually develop Bitcoin as a practical and successful cryptocurrency, obviously took ideas from cypherpunk ideology, but he demonstrably also believed Bitcoin could be successful in its high ambitions without radical decentralization (re: fewer high-powered nodes, &amp; larger/unlimited block size). I give this example not to say that is the right way, but to help illustrate how you may think your ideology is the One Truth (and I may sympathize, and even agree to some degree), but that creative practical thinking like that of Satoshi's is what truly works, without being completely wedded to only one way of doing things. Rarely is the best way of doing things a black and white matter.

Gavin and Hearn both argue this (Gavin says transactions will soon hit a 'wall' and Hearn talks about the coming capacity 'cliff' -- the implication and direct suggestion being that this is a 'crisis' that needs to be addressed). See their various blog posts.

I would love to, and I even have on occasion browsed through your thread, but I really don't have time to wade through so much content. Is there a clear tl;dr of the salient points?
And have you sought to (politely) get feedback from Blockstream members re: your concerns, and see if they can be addressed?
To clarify, fundamentally I do not think Blockstream would be foolish enough to jeopardize its members' reputations, its company's reputation, or it's investors' reputations by engaging in efforts that ultimately result in harm to Bitcoin. So, I think they will be eager to get constructive criticism so they can assess and try to fix all issues.
Peter Todd has already raised a concern about the security model of sidechains, so that's one area they are already aware of and working on.

The argument concerns data caps, not speeds. See:


@_date: 2015-06-26 23:43:55
It's not being split; in a basic sense, the btc is 'locked' on the 'mainchain', converted to the token used by the 'sidechain' of choice (then, one can does what one wants on that sidechain), then if/when needed it's converted back to btc, and 'unlocked' for use on mainchain.
Throughout, the btc are used in a full-reserve manner to 'back' the sidechain tokens (cryptographically verified and automatic, of course). Thus, the 21m fixed supply of btc does not change.
The benefit lies in gaining access to way more functionality than is possible (or currently implemented) with the current Bitcoin network (e.g. a 'Confidential Transactions' sidechain for true privacy of balance). Also, this should help finally obliterate altcoins &amp; their pump-and-dump models (and the distractions that result from diluting developer resources away from Bitcoin), by making it trivial to duplicate all altcoin functionality in bitcoin-backed sidechains (a goal that is often stated by Blockstream employees including gmaxwell), i.e. a Dogecoin sidechain, Litecoin sidechain, or BitShares sidechain.
Really, the potential is quite endless. Yes, there are certain challenges associated with sidechains, but I'm confident that weaknesses will be overcome with further development.

Anyone using wallet that has updated to support SW will immediately experience lower tx fees (due to smaller SW tx size), and higher capacity. No need to wait for everyone else to update.
2nd largest iOS wallet has already committed to support SW soft-fork, as soon as it's available. If they can do it, obviously any larger wallet can do the same. Devs are also available to assist integration efforts.


"Better implemented" (with subtle advantages), but more riskier to deploy and needing a longer lead time. Overall, soft-fork is superior avenue. It can be implemented more quickly.


Here you are wrong. Remember SW does not increase capacity by 1.75-2x "for free". There is bandwidth impact. There is consensus for ONLY increasing block size to 2MB... in other words, increasing capacity by 2x. If you combined SW + block size increase to 2MB, then that means 3.5-4x increase in system requirements. That does not have consensus at all.
Thus, it's an "either / or" situation.
Core has chosen SW soft-fork, for the aforementioned reasons.

Most likely, it seems soft-fork SW will be deployed within 3 months. It is way too long to wait until next year. We're already at about 60% capacity usage, so raising capacity at least ~2x is kinda essential, sooner rather than later. And, importantly, the network can handle an increase of this magnitude.

No one says there is no room. The universal point is about priorities &amp; opportunity cost. (I agree with you that UI/UX needs focus, btw.

It's a nice free market mechanism, isn't it. Those pools that can't get their act together and help maintain the network, by upgrading at a reasonable pace, get their blocks rejected and lose money (lowering their status, and raising the status of the 'good citizen' pools). Over time, it should trend to an efficient mining network. Though, this model would work best with a mining hashrate that is much more decentralized.

I'll see if I can find his quote, but the idea is that in an emergency situation, the choice becomes not one of ideals of decentralization, but rather a choice of: a functional network with less node decentralization, or a non-functional network (with more decentralization).
In that situation, gmaxwell expects consensus to rapidly and obviously form in favor of increasing block size.
@_date: 2015-06-25 05:04:15
It's quite different though; BIP 100 gives the possibility of increase, but with miner input deciding the pace (as a form of 'free market' input, rather than 'corruptible, potentially biased human' dev input). Also, see this comment by Garzik:


By the way, remember most of the devs are for an increase (Maxwell apparently laid out a "concrete proposal" for an increase to 2MB), but they differ in their views on the pace/scale of the increase.

According to an analysis by Tradeblock, at ~2.3 transactions/sec (TPS), we'll begin experiencing confirmations that take &gt; 1 block.  -- According to this, we're ~75 transactions/min (TPM). 2.3 TPS = 138 TPM, so when TPM increases from 75 to 138 (~85% increase, 1.85x), we may begin experiencing issues.
If we want to allow transaction volume to spike by 5x (as quite a safe limit for now? since during the late 2013 rally, transactions spiked by 2x regular volume), then that's 75*5 = 375. Then, 375/138 = 2.7. So, increasing block size by 2.7x, or from 1 to 2.7 MB, would appear to be a safe block size increase for now.
A block size of 2.7MB, or 4MB if rounding up to the amount Gavin said was "OK" during the Chinese miner talk, seems like a good stopgap measure. It should not be controversial to increase from 1 to 2.7 MB (allowing a 5x spike over average volume), or 4MB (allowing a 7.3x spike), both far exceeding the historical 2x spike in late 2013's monster rally.

@_date: 2015-06-13 00:25:57
This feels like deja vu. Have we had almost this exact conversation before already? Lol.
Anyway, I completely disagree with this characterization of "I think a basic consumer broadband subscription letting someone run a full node with 80 GB left over is pretty good." -- As I explained before to you, or someone else, that is not how the real world works. I, and *most* other rational economic actors, am not going to pay $100/month for my home internet connection with a 250 GB cap, and then host a node and lose 68% of the bandwidth paid for so that, in effect, I paid $100/month for only 80 GB of data. You can try to justify it here as being "pretty good" and an "extremely fair trade-off" but I absolutely don't see it that way; and, I'm saying that being a total supporter of Bitcoin!
So, this is about making a choice.
1) Aim for a lower max blocksize limit that is correspondent with the state of bandwidth today (and if scaling for the future, scale that limit according to the real growth in bandwidth) in order to maintain decentralization of nodes on the network. Or, 2) Forget about having an illusion of decentralized nodes and say upfront you are OK with a more centralized Bitcoin network with an order of magnitude fewer nodes.
This was the point illustrated by the video.
On the other hand, there is an argument that was made to me, something along the lines of this: if 1% of 500,000 users = 5,000 nodes, but Bitcoin scales 10x or 100x, then even 0.1% (order of magnitude smaller proportion of people hosting nodes) of 5,000,000 users = 5,000 nodes and 0.1% of 50,000,000 users = 50,000 nodes.
So: (much) larger blocks --&gt; (much more) onerous bandwidth requirement --&gt; more scale (more users supported) --&gt; (paradoxically) more decentralization of nodes in the Bitcoin network
I like this argument, and it does make sense. It feels a bit like the currently successful model of the few-in-number altruistic (or just rich? who knows) torrent seeders with high-powered internet connections, who submit most of the content and also seed that content to others.
But to be safe, the question to fully understand is what parameters will get us 10x or 100x more scale, and whether those parameters still keep node hosting decentralized enough to allow the 0.1% or higher proportion to be in effect.
Also, there is the consideration that it may not be a linear relationship that 0.1% of users will be hosting nodes. It's possible another 'drag' (besides internet bandwidth requirement) on node hosts is that most new users will be 'pure consumers', instead of the early adopters right now who are still quite interested in the technology and the underlying systems.
Either way, this video illustrates the issue very, very well, and it's a pity it did not gain more upvotes so that it could help more people understand the issue and be more informed in the discussion.

Gavin, did you *really* just say that? Who do you think you are, to speak like that of other highly competent developers?
You know who I think is "bad for Bitcoin"?
Someone incompetent, who exhibits the Dunning-Kruger effect, as defined by: One who prefers to ignore real threats and pretend they don't exist (while the other developers acknowledge said threats and use their intelligence &amp; hard work to mitigate them), and at the same time, one who constantly bashes those people who are actually thinking about &amp; working on those very real problems.
As an aside, your work to address scalability in the last 2 years (BIP101) was supposedly "tested", right?
It was recently shown (through *actual* testing) by even jtoomim to be untenable above 3MB, for miners representing 66% of hashrate. This is the same "tested and coded" BIP that has been paraded around for the last 1 year (and is the basis for the divisive XT hard fork), and the one you used to mock others with by saying "average webpage is more than 2MB", as if it had any relevance to Bitcoin network scaling (as opposed to being a politically-motivated talking point).

I don't think Peter can handle it by himself, with all due respect to u/petertodd. There's a meme (character assassination) that has been spread widely that Peter's opinion doesn't matter, due to a bunch of spurious reasons. I think it's time the community actually stuck their necks out, and confronted people like Gavin, when they dare to make such statements. Otherwise, by making such statements, he is bullying other developers and insinuating their views don't matter. If we let that slide, then his lies will only increase in their audacity and he will succeed in marginalizing their views (and continuing the aforementioned meme).


True, done.


This is not a "point", in the sense that everyone knows that. If that is his point, then that is still disingenuous. As an example, even Luke (!) is okay with BIP102 (2x increase) and actively was working to test &amp; advance it yesterday. Luke was also the person instrumental in devising how to soft-fork SW (1.75x increase). Gavin's "point" is not relevant anymore, if it ever was. Not a single Core dev anymore says that they won't support minimum 2MB block size (in terms of increased bandwidth req).


Exactly, which is why we need to learn to speak up and support the people Gavin explicitly/implicitly tries to marginalize (past victims: Greg, Luke, Adam, Mark Friedenbach, and possibly others).
I hope you realize Gavin's actions are already hurting Bitcoin development. Why do you think the latest gmaxwell event happened? Certainly not because of innocuous reasons with no connection to the developments of the last 1 year.

Yes, good job u/jgarzik :).
Its rate of growth goes from higher to lower, over time. That's a perfect tempo, IMO. Higher growth will occur earlier on (potentially), so it's better to plan in that direction to be safe, while also ensuring that long-term we don't increase to an unnecessarily high block size too quickly.
@_date: 2015-06-13 16:28:53

All that sorting by controversial does is put posts with mix of negative and positive votes at the top. I don't know why it's been that way.

What do these two things have to do with each other?
I'm not "okay with Blockstream influencing development". I don't think they're influencing anything. The way Core works is by taking input of hundreds of diverse developers, and having open conversation and debate on the mailing list. Then, there is further debate on IRC and GitHub. It is only after a lot of peer review of open-source code, that anything gets implemented.
As for the sub's censorship, yes, there is a small amount of censorship going on. However, it's not intended to mold debate, but rather the intention is directed against 'trolls'. I still think it can be handled better, but it's not 'censorship' ... rather, it's 'sometimes aggressive moderation'.
I don't want to keep 1 MB blocks, nor do 99% of people on either side of the debate. That is another lie promoted by certain people who have an agenda. I just want a slower rate of increase, correct. BIP 101 (41%/year for 20 years) seems a bit absurd, and BitFury's analysis confirms that:

What's funnier is that facts get distorted &amp; twisted by you guys, as you feel like it.
In the real world, the opposition was to BIP101 because it jumps to 8MB (8x increase), then increases for 20 years at 41%/year. In the case of SW, we are 2x-ing bandwidth demand (NOT 8x-ing), and there is no associated 20-year-long 41% increase in bandwidth requirement.
And, FYI, the reason SW is a pre-req for LN is because it fixes malleability. Malleability is an attack vector against the whole network, so it's highly valuable to fix! But do keep FUD-ing about how SW is simply just for LN... and how it's all a conspiracy.
1MB blocks were never "too big". The issue was BIP101, for the reasons I explained.
Okay, I think I addressed all the FUD.

I agree with you that "higher fees" does not seem like a reasonable answer. Bigger blocks trumps that, since it results in a better end-user experience than does increasing transaction fee.
But, I don't agree that incentives have not changed since Satoshi; there has been a lot of development of the protocol and incentives have had to be carefully balanced at every step.

How is iOS and iPhone "inherently compromised"? The data shows iOS is the most secure and malware resistant platform in existence, vs. the other smartphone competition.
Also, to play devil's advocate, Satoshi still said in no uncertain terms that he foresees (and is ok with) the network becoming dominated by high-powered nodes in data centers. Can you rationalize why he would say this?
@_date: 2015-06-09 19:39:36
I don't think services (users of Bitcoin) are of the same caliber as core developers, who write the Bitcoin software. Services have lots of money and can run nodes, but the issue is that regular people will not be able to run nodes with 170 GB bandwidth requirement every month (equivalent to 5.7 GB/day). One big reason why is data caps are average 250 GB/month, so a node will suck too much data.

Sure, I think it's better to have a 'bad' solution (bad why? because it's only 7 min on average? I disagree it's bad in that sense, since 420 seconds is relatively infinitely higher than 0 seconds -- which makes it a very good improvement!), instead of no solution.
Objectively, it's better to have something than nothing. In fact, that's the argument people make over block size-based scaling ("it's better to have a scaling solution based on what we know and have, block size increases, instead of fantasizing about experimental solutions like Lightning" -- even though block size increases can have negative effects on decentralization, as well as offer much less scaling than Lightning would).

Hmm, but what you're suggesting involves paying a % fee (losing money) on every conversion. Instead, I feel it's more sensible to reach consensus on 1 or max 2-3 cryptocurrencies, and exclusively run commerce on those. This would mean much lower conversion fees. I don't like the idea of starting with 1 bitcoin and 2 conversions later ending with 0.95 bitcoins.
On the other hand, your vision could be achieved (and still without any conversion fees), if Bitcoin's sidechains project realizes its ultimate vision of stable, secure, adaptable sidechains. Each sidechain would fundamentally use bitcoins in the background, but could be customized to be shown in the foreground as 'uberCoin' or 'WoWcoin', etc.
If you haven't, I'd recommend reading up on the latest sidechain posts and the video of Greg Maxwell discussing it.

The coders understand the complexity, as they wrote the actual Bitcoin software. The masses understand it at a far more superficial level. I choose the experts over the mob any day.

Not sure how you define "rarity" -- BIP70 is available on most reputable wallets: breadwallet, Airbitz, Copay, Mycelium, etc.


Yeah, no one said it's going to be instantly available. Although, Electrum has already committed to integrating Lightning. The wallets that drag their feet and take a long time will lose users. The wallets that are quick will gain users. The free market will continue. Lightning offers tangible &amp; extreme benefits, so there is no reason for wallets not to quickly integrate it. BIP70, by comparison, is a lot less compelling than Lightning.

Yep, CT is not perfect (no hiding of transaction graph) alone, but I think it alone (without CoinJoin) solves 99% of the problem. e.g. I don't personally care to hide the linkages between addresses and who I send to or receive from; rather, I'm more concerned about hiding the balance of the addresses and the amounts transferred, so that someone I send money to cannot backtrace my sending address and discover the balance remaining. Transaction graph privacy would be a nice bonus, but I'd feel much more comfortable spending bitcoins with CT alone.

Please think logically, for just one second.
Mike &amp; Gavin strongly support boosting the max blocksize from 1MB to 4MB/8MB/20MB. So, why would you consider their opinions (that it will "sputter and die") as fact, when they are obviously biased by their position?
There are many other core developers and core contributors, who absolutely do not think the situation is this dire, and thus support only a more modest increase e.g. 2MB, so that bandwidth requirements for running a node do not shoot up from 8.5 GB/month to 170 GB/month.
@_date: 2015-12-21 00:29:41

That means there will be no selling below $400 by those entities. What about the holders of the other 80% of coins? They're free to do as they like.
This 'agreement' also does not discuss 'buyers' who will buy below $400 to "keep bitcoin between a $400-500 trading range in order to reduce volatility".  Without that side of the equation, this alleged agreement doesn't mean anything.
@_date: 2015-12-01 00:41:20
Their argument is that as a for-profit, they can be more benevolent. This is due to receiving more funding from investors (which is logical), and making money from for-profit activities (like the Liquid private sidechain for exchanges). That money can then be funneled back into Bitcoin protocol development (e.g. layer 2: sidechains + Lightning, plus layer 1: core protocol work) -- all of which is open-source work viewable by anyone.
As a non-profit, it's harder to raise money.

"Some people"... yes, like your boss! The CEO of the  Bitcoin bank/wallet/exchange in the U.S., and backed by Andreessen Horowitz (one of the top VC firms in the world) and &gt; $100 million. Isn't that embarrassing? You need to start educating him, pronto, so we can stop getting embarrassing "industry letters" that pressure the Bitcoin network to move to radical proposals that will harm Bitcoin's health.
I have spoken to a bunch of people from various Bitcoin companies, and it seems like MANY (maybe majority??) employees and perhaps even CEOs are woefully lacking in education about how Bitcoin works. They all need a serious dose of Bitcoin education. Maybe the Core devs. can organize education sessions, or these people can individually take responsibility to learn how Bitcoin really works.
The main problem in this entire debate, in my opinion, is simply: ignorance / naivete. I don't think there's any excuse for it. Anyone working at a Bitcoin company has no excuse for being ignorant about how Bitcoin works, especially not those in positions of power or influence.

It's not of course a substitute for reasoned verbal arguments that can explore the nuance, but it at least shows the big picture (significance of nodes in the Bitcoin network -- even Balaji and Andresen Horowitz in their slide sets and talks never mention nodes' significance; they always only talk about miners, devs, users, and merchants -- so there does seem to be a significant lack of education in the ecosystem regarding importance of nodes).

Actually, that's the problem; the data usage cap is not sitting there for sole use by a node. My cap with a 105/10 Mbps connection is 250 GB. No way will I run a node if it means having only 80 GB bandwidth/month left over for my internet activities.

?? Sorry, this comment and the other thread you made is unwarranted (IMO). Luke not having financial sense, in terms of recognizing a faulty exchange, has nothing to do with Luke's knowledge about Bitcoin's technical underpinnings or its past/present (and hence future) developments. He is far more of a technical expert on Bitcoin than most people here (including myself), though of course this does not preclude him from being wrong at times. He openly spends time correcting misconceptions and spreading his knowledge around, and is perhaps more active on this subreddit than any other Bitcoin expert ('expert' defined as person with the books icon next to the name). I sincerely thank you for that; we are more knowledgeable for it.
What Luke says about not trusting less than 8 confirmations, further, is simply his opinion and he is entitled to an opinion. If he wants to be extra paranoid about the security/finality of transactions (and wants to be 99.99999999% sure a transaction is irreversible), then he really has every right to it.

Okay, but do you accept that an invention like Bitcoin is not something to be hoarded by a small group? The entire world can potentially benefit from, and want to use it. As a result, that is the user base that must be supported. Bitcoin has become a global phenomenon. In order for such a large set of users to be accommodated, we may not be able to have the 'ideal' amount of decentralization. For example, a rural internet connection of 3/1 Mbps (or whatever) may not be able to be supported... and that's a reasonable and understandable tradeoff. This is what I mean by a compromise, since I know you've mentioned your internet service wouldn't let you host a node if size was increased. It's a compromise because trends in internet service are what matter, not data points on the fringes. (In comparison, speeds of 100/10 or 50/50 Mbps are common where I live.)
But, this does not mean that Bitcoin has to become VISA. Again, you're swinging wildly between extremes. No one at any end of the debate is ever saying they would be happy with Bitcoin morphing into Visa. Bitcoin characteristics (instant, irreversible, counterfeit-proof, portable, secure, wireless, seizure-proof, government policy- (inflation-) proof, cheap, etc.) can still be maintained even if relatively minor compromises (i.e. block size, scalability, node hosting requirements) must be made in order to allow the project to move forward.
P.S. You didn't really acknowledge that Satoshi himself has the same vision as you, yet was not stuck on certain aspects of decentralization as being make or break in reaching there ( Though, if we can reach the same end goal with far more decentralization of nodes than what Satoshi envisioned, then I'm all for it obviously.
Again, I'm just advocating a practical approach that looks at the big picture, instead of getting mired in what are really going to be inconsequential stumbling points. There are a million variables in life that we cannot control, that can change the path of what is expected or planned. Tomorrow, SpaceX may launch cheap, fast global internet coverage via low-orbit micro-satellites. Who knows what will end up happening on the periphery, in this age of exponential tech advancement? It's not wise to be rigid in thinking.

Core isn't going to be party to putting Bitcoin on a path toward destruction. They are operating within technical limits (explicitly not politics; if Bitcoin dev occurs according to emotional whims &amp; politics &amp; compromises on security, then Bitcoin is vulnerable / doomed in the longterm), based on current best information on how to scale responsibly (SW soft-fork by April 2016 to increase capacity by ~1.75-2x).
Current Roadmap:


Also, separate from Core, but relevant:


Everyone else can do what they like, since Bitcoin Core does not define the consensus rules.
If the market ends up disregarding Core's warnings, then they will merely move on to another project and start again (applying what they have learned from the current project). -- not a threat, just reality.

False: ~3 months, according to Luke.


False: blocks are averaging about 50-60% full.


Bitcoin is not "going mainstream" by magic within 1 year. It's a process. SW provides more than enough capacity increase to handle projected demand for an extra 1 year. In the meantime, hard fork block size increase + Lightning can be discussed &amp; implemented.
@_date: 2015-06-03 20:56:53




@_date: 2015-06-09 23:01:55
Right, I understand, but the concern is a 20MB block size means 1 node consumes 170 GB/month in bandwidth. Like I mentioned in the link, this is 68% of my 250 GB data cap, and only leaves 80 GB for the month. That's impractical, which means I (and others in my position) will no longer host a node.
Contrast this with a combination of raising the fee (through 'fee pressure') from minimum 0.25 cents to 2.5 cents, as well as increasing block size (but less!) to say 4MB or 8MB (it means instead of 170 GB bandwidth, more like 34 GB or 68 GB). This will increase node size only enough to last for another 1-2 years, but it is a way to 'buy time' until real solutions are found.
Remember the 20MB proposal was not meant as a end-solution for scalability. It is temporary, until real solutions can be developed (e.g. Lightning, maybe some innovative idea made possible with creative use of a sidechain, etc.). Another possible real solution is that the block size keeps being increased perpetually, based on how quickly internet service progresses in the world. That would also allow nodes to stay decentralized, while still scaling the network as needed.

I think this may be a better representation of what is going on; look at "Transactions per sec" -- it definitely is elevated, currently averaging ~1.65-1.70:


I agree it's probably related to buying pressure, as price is up 2.5% since yesterday.


TradeBlock's previous analysis suggests the 2.3 TPS mark is when transactions begin taking &gt; 1 block to process. That's a 35% increase from the current rate. If and when we reach closer to the wall, I think the various devs currently in opposition will quickly realize the severity of the situation and act prudently. As gmaxwell said, a functional network with less decentralization is better than a non-functional network. Hence, I wouldn't be too concerned with this.


On a related note, the facts, such as from that TradeBlock analysis, should be used far more frequently in debate, hint hint. I would fully support a debate predicated on such forms of legit analysis, instead of ad-hominem attacks and conspiracy theories (defined as anything unsupported by hard fact).
But on that note, u/cypherdoc2, what say you regarding this from the analysis:


In contrast to the idea that this situation is a crisis, this analysis (based on analysis from 2011-2015) suggests there still remains 1 whole year for which 1MB will be viable. If that is true, then maybe those opposed to a 'rushed' increase have grounds...? Perhaps they have different info than we do, and expect alternative scalability solutions like Lightning (which Gavin himself blogged about, saying it's required for 'true' scalability because block size is not a terminal solution) to be developed and ready by that time.
@_date: 2015-06-25 00:12:00
Fantastic article; this is really bullish for Bitcoin, as it shows how its decentralized nature is a real asset towards helping the network reach the best decisions with maximum consensus (each part of the system has a say, and it helps create a system of 'checks and balances').

Hi Max, keep in mind not to get deceived by the misleading argument of XT/101. No one on the non-XT/101 side is opposed to increasing block size, despite this constant characterization.

Based on my limited knowledge (no 'insider' info), I blame Hearn.
Watch this video in its entirety, and notice the tone of voice, body language, and words exchanged, indicating how buddy-buddy Hearn and Gavin have become:


Gavin even directly references how "people have been urging him to be more of a dictator," then he looks at Hearn, nudging towards him and smiling and says "like him", and Hearn laughs.
Fortunately, in the time since this video was released, Gavin seems to have adopted a somewhat more conciliatory attitude (see the 'compromise' agreement with Chung Wang of F2pool on the dev mailing list where Gavin 'agreed' to go from 20MB to 8MB or 4MB, if the concern was that 20MB was "too big").

Kudos on looking for the facts and tipping for them!
I don't have much to add, but I prefer examining arguments instead of people, anyway. So, let me instead try to help you understand my view by reiterating the argument against 20MB block increase:


In light of the above, let me also reiterate that a more sensible increase (remember the increase is only intended as a stopgap until real solutions are developed) is universally accepted... e.g. 4MB or 8MB. --&gt; 4MB = 34 GB/month; 8MB = 68 GB/month. Both of these are far more reasonable than 20MB (170 GB/month, 5.7 GB/day).
@_date: 2015-06-20 04:58:31
Okay, enough endless FUD. Let's do some arithmetic and examine some hard numbers and facts.
Right now, it is possible to get a transaction confirmed with a fee as low as 0.00001 BTC, or 0.25 cents... a quarter of a cent. Even if fees theoretically are forced to rise by a factor of 10 to accommodate more transactions and counter spam/attacks, that would lead us to a fee of 0.0001 BTC, or 2.5 cents. If fees rise another order of magnitude (100x higher than current fee), the fee would rise to 25 cents.
I personally think 25 cents verges on the border of hurting the attraction of transactions. However, I could imagine a scenario where paying a 25-cent premium for the security/convenience afforded by on-chain transactions, in exchange for certain benefits (greater security, greater scalability, maintenance of radical network decentralization, etc.), could end up being worth it (especially with viable Layer 2 options). Other variables that affect the debate and work in concert, include: block size, state of decentralization of the mining network, decentralization of node network, and viability of Layer 2 solutions (Lightning, Strawpay, Amiko Pay, sidechains, payment channels, etc.).
In essence, no system is perfect, and it was always clear in Bitcoin development discussions that tradeoffs will always exist. It is a part of life; we don't live in a magical Utopia alternative dimension. However, it is the community (users, developers, companies, nodes, miners) that will ultimately decide at what point the tradeoffs are no longer worth it, and where to draw the line.

I don't really care who "considers" it not to be a scaling solution. It is, if you care to take the time to read and understand SW. End of story. This deals with the "block space starvation" as you call it (seriously, what hyperbolic terms lol.), too, since at least it 2x-es the capacity.
The only issue is how quickly wallets will adopt SW. Like I already said though, the incentives are aligned to suggest adoption will be quick (unless they enjoy paying high transaction fees). I still agree with Jeff that it's an "unknown" to some extent, so ideal is if wallets can make statements on their timeline for SW. Nodes will still validate as usual, except for SW txs. And when they update, they'll validate that too.
How is fixing malleability attack vector not critical? Did you already forget the last wave of malleability attacks, and the nuisance disruption it caused with duplicate transactions? Greg solved that with a "patch", nothing perfect for all malleability attacks. If you want to resolve that, then SW is critical.
I would even argue "super SPV" (fraud proofs-enabled SPV) is critical, since again, it concerns improving wallet security (and hence the security of users' bitcoins).
Security features are always "critical", IMO.

Yes, I know how Reddit works... :)


My counterargument... It takes "x" amount of time for a post to accumulate enough votes to collapse itself. It takes "y" amount of time for an admin to notice a reported scam in their mod queue. I wonder if x is close enough to y, such that it doesn't actually make a difference.
If the difference in time is too long, maybe a compromise is to restore collapsing of buried comments, but keep the vote hiding. But that would be unfortunate since burying comments is like mildly censoring unpopular views. It's nice to see all the views together and decide for yourself.
@_date: 2015-12-08 15:10:27
Yeah, but: 1) This isn't a selective policy. All buried comments are now exposed. This includes from both sides., and 2) The issue of deleting posts is not relevant to this policy. These are two separate things.
Also, re: 2, you're assuming that the mods even do what you're saying, or that's it's a widespread phenomenon. I've noticed it sometimes, but almost always it's either: 1) AutoMod auto flagging things and then mods have to manually approve it, or 2) They are removing actual spam or trolling (aka, doing normal job of 'moderating' so the forum has some semblance of order).
In other words, tl;dr, this irrational hate towards anything the mods do is, just that: irrational. They screwed up a few months ago, but since then, things have been made much more relaxed, in practice. Yeah, dumb stuff keeps happening, but you should focus on the actual dumb stuff (ban coinbase, ban bitstamp, etc.) and not justify hate &amp; irrational paranoia re: a policy that practically actually is pro-transparency and anti-groupthink.
If some people have a problem with it, it's because they are irritated that they can no longer brigade &amp; bury comments they don't like. If that's the case, then this policy is a genius way to combat those emotional people. For people who are interested in evaluating comments by merit (facts, logic, evidence), rather than by if it's buried or not, this policy is great.
It's disorienting without having the vote score, but it seems like a nice experiment to run.

He said a hard fork to 20MB can be rolled out "within days" with full consensus, if the situation arises that without the patch the network does not function well.
@_date: 2015-12-12 19:06:25


That characterization doesn't make sense. No one said Lightning is coming out in 1 year, and then 1 year later it didn't come out and people said again it's coming out in 1 more year, and so on and so forth. That's the pattern behind "two weeks". It doesn't apply here, so I'm not sure what you are seeing?


How is something alpha if it's non-functional? LN is still being developed, so no it's not even alpha yet. As I said, a testnet version is expected within the next 3 months.


There is never such a magical date available for these things, just a best estimate.


To the contrary, LN has received an incredible amount of peer review by now, and challenges (network topology related) are being aired in the open and discussed (like at Hong Kong).
Deployment is a process. It's estimated to be ready in some form within 1 year. After that, to help it mature and be used for a higher percentage of transactions, it will take time. This is exactly why SW + block size increase proposals are on the table.

The reason why this is a bad idea is that it leads to an outcome that is not optimal. The reality is that both sides offer good ideas. Thus, doing the admittedly hard work to forge a consensus will ultimately be worth the effort, by allowing the different strengths of the two camps to make Bitcoin stronger. Forking and diverging into 2 coins is the weak, cowardly approach and would never create a system as optimal.

@_date: 2015-06-20 19:57:02
No, you're mostly correct. I agree, current fiat payment processors have done a good job with what is available technology-wise with fiat. It's also true that most consumers don't really seem to care about their privacy, nor about centralized models and trusted third parties.
However, Bitcoin does offer fundamental benefits over fiat, owing to its nature as a cryptocurrency. One thing immediately that stands out is that it is an open system and highly interoperable in the same way as email. Anyone in the world with internet access (including via smartphone, which is becoming ubiquitous everywhere) can easily be set up with a bitcoin address and be able to transact locally or internationally for any purpose whatsoever (tipping, e-commerce and in-person commerce, bypassing paywalls to read news articles, etc. etc.).
This is in stark contrast to Visa and MasterCard, which are subject to much more friction to use and subject to national laws and regulations (i.e. Visa and MasterCard do not work in every jurisdiction and these companies won't or can't just ignore laws and let a merchant use their services). Bitcoin has almost zero friction (once the Bitcoin is acquired, which is becoming easier every day as services improve) since it just needs a wallet app, and does not need to be "approved" by a country in order for its citizens to start using it.
Also, although consumers don't benefit as much from Bitcoin's irreversible nature (lack of chargebacks) and the merchant's 2.9% fee, merchants *do* benefit. Thus, there is an incentive for merchants to push it to eliminate chargebacks and bring the 2.9% fee down to 0%. As merchants see the benefits and encourage it, then consumers will gradually start using it. I mentioned in the prior paragraphs some benefits for consumers...
You mention Visa and MasterCard "protect customers' accounts from fraud," but in fact they are failing to do that as you surely know? Hacking is becoming ubiquitous these days and merchants are losing control over their customers' credit card data, which gets stolen and then sold. Customers then must deal with getting new credit cards and deal with Support, all leading to a bad customer experience. This leads to another benefit for consumers to use Bitcoin, which is that Bitcoin is a "push" system not "pull" like with credit cards. A bitcoin address cannot be hacked by the merchant, or by a hacker who hacks the merchant, to steal funds or to steal identities. Yes, bitcoin wallets can be hacked if the wallet implementation is insecure, but again this is a nascent industry and wallet security is also improving (hardware wallets, software wallets with multisig and/or biometric auth and/or PIN code on an encrypted secure device like iPhone, etc.).
So, in summary, fiat has advantages but cryptocurrency (of which Bitcoin is the vastly dominant one) also has its own unique aspects. The industry (wallets, etc.) is still developing and even the Bitcoin protocol is still developing. Scalability is not solved yet as you allude, so Visa and MasterCard have an advantage there; but, even that is actively being worked on (e.g. see Lightning).
Thanks for your thoughtful comment. It's always nice to see some constructive, legitimate criticism.

Yep, I agree fully. Well, maybe they have mechanisms to communicate rapidly with the whole ecosystem of devs, miners, businesses (and then the 'users' component will fall into line, automatically).
But yes, it's much wiser to use existing knowledge and analysis to form a 'best guess' for the network's future and plan block size based on that, at least for the short-term (next 1-2 years). Let's kick the can for those next couple years (without any perpetual increase) with a 2, 4, or 8MB increase, and then revisit it later to see how much progress has been made on the other scaling solutions. If it turns out to be hopeless, then we can use perpetual automatic block size increases (even though it's less optimal) as the scaling mechanism.
Are we in agreement?
@_date: 2015-06-19 16:24:45
One 'agreement' (more likely due to pressure from Gavin) does not overrule Hearn's 'dictatorial' decision-making style as evinced by his words and actions in the last few months. It's sad because Hearn has previously done a lot of good for Bitcoin (BitcoinJ, Lighthouse,  etc.).
As an aside, the more I examine the debate, the more it seems Gavin has been reasonable all along until Hearn's bad influence (disregard for Bitcoin network decentralization and consensus-style decision making) finally rubbed off on him.

1. This is Bitcoin, not Ethereum. Wrong sub.
2. It was evident from the beginning that purchasing ether was not meant as an investment, but rather to help fund the development of Ethereum (hence as donors). If the ether sale was actually as investors for equity (in any sense), it would have been an illegal operation. Apparently, most did not get the memo and only saw dollar signs flashing in their eyes, hence the unusually large fundraise.

One super simple idea:
1. Put $100,000 worth of bitcoins on a Ledger Nano ($40), or HW.1 ($15).
2. Store in a safe.
Contrast that with the measures required to secure $100,000 worth of gold.
Also, you conveniently ignored: authentication &amp; transport &amp; even usage. All of these things are way easier with BTC than with gold. There's no contest.
@_date: 2015-06-02 18:27:02
Good points; these services you listed will only increase value indirectly (via the intangible notion of increasing goodwill and Bitcoin's reputation), it seems, which is very inefficient. A direct increase in value will come from those who see value in buying and holding bitcoin.
In other words, one use case would be: store of value (digital gold, gold 2.0, unpredictable-inflation-proof  government-proof non-debt-based money, money that can escape capital controls of oppressive regimes if need be, etc.).
Another use case would be payments that are not possible with fiat, or that can only occur with bitcoin: true micro-payments, either machine-to-machine (autonomous vehicle navigation: cars, trucks, drone shipping lanes) or a user paying for services in micro-increments (bandwidth paid by the KB, Streamium.io-like streaming video watched by the second) with payment channels.
Another case of payments not possible with fiat is paying for goods with virtually no fees, and buying goods without restriction: OpenBazaar-style e-commerce.
Maybe another use case could be ease of use of paying online with bitcoin. If/when it becomes frictionless (example right now is online tipping with ChangeTip, or simply scanning a QR code instead of finding your wallet and typing in your credit card number), then there would be value in buying and holding bitcoin.
There's actually a lot of potential use cases, but all are predicated on buying &amp; holding bitcoins. Just using it as a payment rails to interconvert between assets is quite useless for the exchange rate.

Hmm, you make good points, and I'm not sure what the counter-argument is against modification of the miner soft block size limit, or if there even is one.
But, I'll disagree over this point:


The argument made is that the patch can be created and tested beforehand (now). Further the 'communication' aspect needed to communicate with all parties (nodes, miners, large companies, etc.) would also be done now itself. The 'emergency patch' would then be ready for quick implementation, if and when the time came.

I suppose your arguments do have some logic to them, and this is one way to look at it. But what if you and I are wrong?
I think I'd argue for not acting one way or another, until we either find published pertinent research that can deliver answers or until the research can be done. Let's first understand the facts with certainty, and specifically make thoughtful contingency plans to address each scenario, so that future events are not a surprise. Right now, it's all just conjecture. I don't see any legitimate research studies being done on this matter, or being cited by Gavin in his posts.

2-of-3 key splitting is fine on top of it, but please at least consider making a secure implementation of this feature, at least as an *optional* security feature?
To be clear, I'm interested in how the seed alone will no longer be enough for an attacker to acquire, to be able take control of an account's balance. From my reading, it seems a password can be set on top? So, of course, being able to place this extra hurdle on an attacker is extremely beneficial. I would be definitely willing to add a secure password to protect that seed.
From the standpoint of why it may be a good feature, even for the masses, it may help introduce an additional point of failure into the process. If the newb secures the seed poorly, but chooses a secure password, then that password may end up being a savior. If the newb secures the seed reasonably well, but chooses a poor password, then the password still has value in preventing mistakes (with management of the seed) from affecting security. And finally, if the seed is secured poorly, and the password is also poor, at least the poor password can present an obstacle to a hacker, hopefully long enough that the user can retrieve funds and transfer them out.
Either way, what is being asked of users, in such a case? The PIN number, the 12-word seed, and a 'great' password to secure the seed. It does not seem like asking too much, especially since the PIN is entered regularly and the 12-word seed is recorded somewhere (thus not burdening memory). The only thing being asked to remember in this case is the password alone... and that too can be recorded along with the seed, somewhere (though recorded mentally, ideally, so it can never be hacked).
If the above doesn't seem reasonable, and the issue of newbs forgetting passwords is the big issue, then I fall back on what I initially said: "please at least consider making a secure implementation of this feature, at least as an *optional* security feature".
RATIONALE: I would definitely 100% feel more comfortable having a 2nd layer of protection... for example via a secure password memorized in my head (and thus un-hackable), which is protecting the seed from potentially being uncovered physically or digitally (depending on storage location), uncovered either by user error or a clever attacker. If we're not considering the attacker to be a professional (90% the case if storing seed on paper or locally), then even a poor password would block an uncovered seed from being stolen.
Having 2-of-3 on top of a password would only be better, in my opinion.
Although, I do have fears that asking a user to secure 3 keys in 3 different locations (and not forget them, and maintain access forever to them) may be asking an incredible lot? No? I can imagine the typical person simply storing all 3 keys in the same place, ruining the purpose of it. It may be simpler to ask the user just to store securely the single seed, and to also remember a secure password to protect that seed.
And you said this: "key stretching in the standard is very weak so that it can be performed by low power devices" -- Can the standard you're referring to, be made more secure?

Just a very brief comment here. gmaxwell already stated he'd expect consensus to arrive quickly and fully, to raise block size via hard fork within *days*, if the situation became such that it was obvious the network could not handle 1MB. So, no need to worry about inaction from justifying it as spam.
Though on the spam note, one thing that is surely disappointing is this insinuation by some of "spam" transactions, when they're clearly not because they pay the fee like everyone else and are not malicious in intent. No one has a right to judge (i.e. discriminate, censor) any transaction as spam. The system must simply be built to withstand them and work with those transactions (even those not 'spam' that fall in the category of 'malicious attack').

*disclaimer*: I see good arguments on both sides of the block size debate, so this post is not partisan, but rather specifically directed at Hearn who seems to be a bad influence. Also, upon further research, Gavin appears to be more reasonable than I previously thought. The original core devs (minus Hearn) should work together constructively, so that people like Hearn don't get undue influence on the outcome.
Hearn's comments in latter half of video:


To even be contemplating heavy-handed actions that lead to such a frightful outcome, it should be apparent this is all just a game to Hearn. Thanks for the vigilance and highlighting this segment, Hearn basically said the same thing on the mailing list 12 days ago too, so this is not some sort of fluke:








Basically, it being "technically feasible" seems to be all that matters in Hearn's end-goal of achieving XT adoption, regardless of how "messy and undesirable" it may be, and regardless of alienating 60% of Bitcoin's hashrate (Chinese miners) who he thinks ought to just create a "China-specific alt coin".

Thank you very much for your responses and insight in this matter. I've been following along with rapt attention.
I have so far not succumbed to safeguarding my assets with Xapo's 'insured' vault, but it has been on my mind. But now, after learning what is written in Xapo's and Circle's respective terms of service, I'm frankly horrified and disgusted.
I thought IkmoIkmo had you, when he quoted Xapo's FAQ, concerning:


As you said, and if one examines the language closely, it says "are insured as to those 10 bitcoins," so that one is insured 'as to' or, in other words, insured 'regarding'... those 10 bitcoins. It's describing what product one is insured for. It's not actually saying that if one has 10 bitcoins, that one is insured for a value of 10 bitcoins. It's quite a sneaky use of language, and I understand the disbelief from IkmoIkmo regarding it.
As I said, I am fairly disgusted that a company like Xapos, which I considered to have a genuine founder who meant well (Wences) actually is engaging in such deceit. Even Circle has an almost identical clause, in limiting their liability to $100! Incredible. I would love for you to be wrong in your analysis, furthermore, but I really can't deny what the Terms actually state.
Another quite curious thing I notice is that the link to the FAQ concerning insurance, when clicked upon, results in an error page. None of the other FAQ links leads to such an error page. Coincidence? I think not.
The only things I can ask at this point are...
Do you have advice regarding a company in the Bitcoin space that offers true insurance?
And, more generally, are such limited liability clauses for insurance commonplace in most insurance, or is this being done specifically with Bitcoin, as it is a relatively smaller situation and thus flying under the radar?
I have heard of very wealthy Bitcoiners storing large amounts of Bitcoins with Xapo, so I'm also curious why they would do such a thing, if Xapo's liability is truly limited to only $100. Are these Bitcoiners simply naive and in the dark? I'd expect those with large amounts of money to have done their due diligence.

No problem, and no, I'm not affiliated with Adblock or any of these products. I just like to do thorough research on anything before using. I agree there seems to be a feud between the two. But, considering that ABP takes money from advertisers to put them on a whitelist, that seems egregious enough and 'corrupt' enough to warrant never taking another look at them.
I actually use uBlock and AdBlock together, with the idea being that my computer is powerful enough to handle them both and whichever product blocks an ad first (is faster) can feel free to do so. And, if something is missed by one of them, then the other can pick up the slack. Also, like I said, to custom block an ad that is not covered by the filters, I find AdBlock's tool much more user friendly and powerful.

What "perverse incentive"? Have you actually taken the time to understand their arguments, or are you just speaking blindly? You've been making your position known on the forum for a while now, but I see no development of your understanding of the other side.
Their argument is that the current technology cannot scale hugely without centralizing the network (by increasing node hosting requirements) too much, and that this centralization is ultimately harmful for Bitcoin WRT retaining its defining characteristics, namely independence from the current system. How do these things relate? If hosting a node is too onerous, then instead of decentralized nodes we'll have fewer nodes hosted by powerful data centers. This makes the network more centralized, hence more vulnerable to political or corporate influence (whether for the reason of competition, or laws to try to regulate bitcoin transactions just like Visa or MasterCard, or create whitelists and blacklists of coins).
I'm not saying I agree that a simple block increase to 20MB (for example) will cause such a huge effect on centralization (my position lies in between, since there are pros and cons to both sides -- e.g. I agree that transaction fees should ideally be kept 'low', however that is defined), but the argument is certainly sound and can be debated without alluding to "perverse incentives" (thereby implicitly accusing those making the argument of having ulterior motives that are not in Bitcoin's interest, which is an outrageous accusation to make re: Blockstream, considering their work). That argument is like someone who accuses another of not being a "patriot" just because the other is questioning the way forward.
It's extremely disappointing that you would say such things, given the good you've done for Bitcoin previously with your YouTube videos and how you seemed to understand Bitcoin's benefits at a deeper level (benefits that are indeed threatened if Bitcoin's decentralization is degraded too much).
P.S. As an example, I tried to debate Luke Jr on this issue ( to see why he seems to support higher fees, lower user adoption, etc. instead of bigger blocks, and at least according to him the reason is that current software cannot yet scale in a decentralized fashion. I'm still pondering what he said and trying to decide if I agree, and how to respond to this, but my point is these are legitimate concerns. There is no reason to marginalize legitimate views in a bullying or mocking manner; Bitcoin certainly will not become stronger with such an approach.

Nope, Circle is currently about $364.80, while BitStamp is about $361.80. BitStamp is quoting the highest price compared to all the main exchanges, too. So, Circle's price is at a premium of about 1%, despite marketing themselves as being "free" vs. Coinbase. On net, however, Coinbase has still always been about 0.5-1% more expensive (including Coinbase's 1% fee, on top of the market price they quote), so Circle remains slightly cheaper.
It's just dishonest marketing on Circle's part to claim to be free. On the other hand, Coinbase is being transparent, by explicitly stating a 1% fee, along with quoting market prices almost on the dot.

breadwallet (iOS) is one answer.
Great developer behind it, secure app, easy to use, updated regularly, easy to backup (one-time 12-word seed), open source, only decentralized bitcoin client (SPV) on iOS (so server-hack-proof), etc. etc.
It's a hierarchical deterministic wallet, but not very private besides that, which is a downside. But, privacy features are coming in future updates: Tor support, CoinShuffle, and merge avoidance, among other things.

This is a completely unrealistic solution for most people. I can't believe it's even being suggested so matter-of-factly, especially when alternatives exist.
Breadwallet (iPhone) is infinitely more intuitive and easier to use than Armory, wouldn't you agree? And, for practical purposes, it's just as secure (or more secure, since Armory is vulnerable to malware and keyloggers). It will also get even more secure and even easier to use, with coming updates (deterministic builds, secret splitting multisig for the 12-word backup seed, touch ID, basic floating fees of 10-100 bits, merge avoidance, OneName integration, stealth addresses, etc).

@_date: 2014-11-18 15:15:58
Well, maybe that was the wrong word. Personally, it's annoying to use paper for anything. I don't secure anything of mine in a physical safe, and have never needed to (ever).
We live in the digital age, and so I'm hoping a solution emerges that allows for a backup's security to be maintained digitally, not via paper. Or, if there are tips to continue using encrypted password managers like Dashlane (doesn't store user's decryption key anywhere) safely, without being at the risk for malware/keyloggers.
I don't know, I said 'absurd' in the context of the mainstream. Sure, I could start using paper and store it somewhere hoping I don't lose it, but 1) storing it somewhere secure that can't be broken into (and eliminating counterparty risk), and 2) not forgetting where it is stored (years down the line)... does seem like asking too much.
Doesn't it?
You posted a video once of a parody (?) of IT support dealing with inane customers who "WILL click on that shady email attachment" etc etc. If this is true (supposedly it is), then again yes, it does seem 'absurd' to imagine the average person doing these steps to write down/store securely/remember location of the backup.
To consider one answer to my own question... is the future like this: 1) users who are not savvy enough to be responsible for sole management of their own private keys will use a 3rd party (Coinbase multisig vault, which has various time delays and protections.. so even if private key is lost by user, the funds are still delayed from being released, leaving time for the user to intervene) + sacrifice financial privacy/freedom in use of the funds in exchange, and 2) users who are savvy enough to secure/backup their private keys, and retain financial privacy/freedom (no 'blocked' transactions or automatic tracking by a 3rd party's heuristics).

To be frank... reading the abstract makes it appear to me that chaos is either present, or imminent, and results in a feeling of lack of control and loss of confidence in the security (speaking generally) of Bitcoin, since a Bitcoin wallet is essential to Bitcoin (storing, using), even if it's not directly part of the protocol.
I'm not a very technical user. I've associated "BIP 32" and "HD wallets" with security, but this paper seems to make the claim that there is a flaw with these technologies, if I'm understanding it right. So now, I'm a bit lost and confused. Rightfully so, or not?

You know what, maybe you've got a point. I still disagree over his performance at Citigroup being anything other than abysmal.
But you're right, it does definitely help the cause having Citigroup's former CEO saying something like "virtual currencies can change the world". Although he's clearly not done his homework properly, most people who encounter Bitcoin for the first time do not, and in fact most reject it automatically. Even Bill Gates did not really discuss Bitcoin in too admirable a way recently, in that his views about the technology were very superficial.
But let's agree that Pandit is not a "smart" dude. I haven't seen any evidence of that from his Citigroup history, nor from his Bitcoin comments, unless you can point out something else.
He honestly sounded totally clueless and like a buffoon, to put it lightly -- "Coinbase allows you to transmit money nearly for free anywhere so Coinbase is where the value is" ... what? He doesn't seem to understand Bitcoin's technology at all, in that someone with a Bitcoin wallet app on their smartphone can do the exact same thing. Coinbase is simply an intermediary to convert fiat to BTC, and hold BTC for the masses like a bank -- there's nothing special technologically about Coinbase besides this, yet Pandit's comments implied otherwise, as if Bitcoin needs Coinbase to function.
But yes, sure, from a Bitcoin awareness-raising/PR standpoint, bravo, Vikram Pandit.

Tipping is a social activity (between people), not between humans and machines. Further, as others have said, this just sounds like turning an activity based on generosity into a mechanism by which to gamble, thereby undermining the 'generosity' component that enables tipping to even occur in the first place. It switches the focus from tipping as a means to spread goodwill and highlight meaningful content, to tipping as a way to get funds with which to gamble.

Thanks for the link, it's definitely relevant.
My counter to the article's attacker's method though is... use a password manager that integrates 2FA.
Interestingly enough, the top comment of that article is:
"I guess now I can stop wondering whether 2-factor authentication for LastPass is worth the effort."
Does that solve the problem?
Dashlane offers option of 2FA when logging into the app on the desktop, mobile, and web. So, even if the keylogger gets the master password, it would be useless without the 2FA code (requiring hacking my device, iPhone).
Further, if not using 2FA, Dashlane sends an email confirmation with a 'code' that needs to be entered, to set up an existing Dashlane account on a new device. Since my email auto-logs-in thanks to Dashlane (no password entered by me manually), the keylogger won't get it.
Also, accessing passwords from Dashlane is done by always having to enter the master password, then just clicking 'copy' to copy the password and 'paste' to paste it in the browser. No keys entered to be logged here either (except the master password, which again, is linked to either 2FA or the emailed code).
Finally, here are some responses I found from Dashlane on the issue of keyloggers, where it seems they have made an effort to offer extra protection:
"I understand that you might be worried, but this is a case we thought about. So here is what would happen if you got a keylogger installed in your computer: 
-If it could force our encryption, it would indeed recognize your master password. 
-Then the hacker would want to install Dashlane on his computer to access your data. 
-When he finished downloading it and fills it with your stolen credentials, he realises that there is a security code that is needed and which was sent on your mailbox. 
-He doesn't have your mailbox credentials because they are stored in your Dashlane.This hacker's keylogger could not register them because of Autofill which is totally encrypted and does not fit at all to a keylogger malware. 
-He smashes his keyboard because he wasted time trying to hack a Dashlane user. 
Did I answer your question? Have a great day!"
"All of your Dashlane data is locally encrypted on your own devices, and the only way to access your account is with your master password which we don't store on your devices or on our own servers -- it's just in your brain! To be clear: the only way to decrypt your data locally and on the cloud (when you want to access it from a different device), is with your master password. If you forget it or lose it, not even you can get into your data yourself, because that master password is the only decryption key. This means that we can't even access your data; in fact, if we were subpoenaed by the government to give them info about you, we couldn't give them anything. We did this on purpose. A good way to know whether a service is secure or not is to see whether the service-provider can help you reset your password in case you forget it... if they can, that means they can access your password and all your data. Apple and Amazon (and 99% of all other web-service providers) can reset your password, so what does that tell you? ;)"
"If there is malware, it is a LOT likelier for the malware to steal your password when you are TYPING it (via a keylogger) than from it being stored in Dashlane. In any case, even though it's really unlikely, we've taken certain measures -- called "packing" and "obfuscation" -- to prevent malware from accessing your Dashlane account."
"To increase the security of your account, Two-Factor Authentication can be enabled from the Preferences of the Dashlane application. An additional code will then be required either each time you need to authorize a new device to access your account, or even more secure, each time you log in to your account. Please note that this replaces entirely the security codes which are normally sent by e-mail when authenticating a new device, or resetting or deleting your account."
"This feature will keep your account safe in the event someone gets to know your master password. That way, that person will not be able to access your data unless he or she also has a hold on the device you set up Two-Factor Authentication with."

**Applying these lessons to breadwallet, and Bitcoin security, more broadly.**
On this note, it might be a really nice idea to have breadwallet integrate 2FA :). Just another roadblock in the way of an attacker.
And I think I mentioned it, but if somehow the 12-word seed can be TIED to 2FA, so that a 2FA code is REQUIRED to 'use' the 12-word seed, then that may just solve the problem of potentially having the 12-word seed stolen. Right? It would operate the same way as the master password does in Dashlane, where the master password allows access to everything, but ONLY when the 2FA code is also provided (2nd layer of protection).
Right now, breadwallet has only 1 layer of protection. I think it pretty urgently could benefit hugely with a 2nd layer, ideally 2FA. I wonder if some coding magic could be whipped up, to allow it! Surely, it would be a massive advance in security, since then the 12-word 'master password' could be stored in more convenient digital repositories (more convenient because accessible from anywhere, at any time).

Sending and receiving money instantly across borders is helpful theoretically, if you have friends or family abroad.
A big reason though, in my opinion, is that Bitcoin (over the long term, and assuming it does not fail) can help protect one from inflation that affects USD, etc. Many of us here are quite well aware of the broken financial system. Things are fine right now, but it's not rational to believe we will remain fine longterm. Bitcoin is free from the State's ability to inflate the money supply, and frankly, experiencing this freedom is intoxicating. It serves as a way to 'escape' from the lunacy of policy decisions (trillions in bailouts, zombie banks, derivatives WMDs according to Buffet, QE, etc.).
Yes, there is responsibility required to purchase and secure bitcoins, but the sense of freedom one gets (if one has the prior knowledge of world affairs and what is going on) in return is priceless.
Many other technological reasons, too. We're just starting out, so a lot of the other benefits do not have practical use cases just yet. It's early days.

Hate it. "Bits" is far more intuitive.
No one uses "bits" in computer science commonly... just think about mainstream for a second. Stop thinking in a narrow sense that is not representative of common reality. The mainstream does not use "bits" for anything. "Bits" is free to use, easy, simple, and available.
P.S. I think you're missing the point. The point is not to sound "computer-ish". That is not how you bring something into the mainstream... use common sense. Mainstream wants simple language that gets the point across in a friendly way, not technical/picture-like sounding "bixel" weirdness.

And Blockstream *only* has the brightest minds in cryptocurrency on their team, so they won't eventually create a viable solution for sidechains, right? (sarcasm) Once sidechains are viably created, it will literally be a watershed moment that signals death for all present/future alt coins, as they can be simply sidechained to Bitcoin.

It's not as simple as that, since Mt. Gox controlled the private key. Thus, it wasn't really a decentralized wallet to begin with.
As an alternative, Blockchain offers 2FA, but also encrypts the private key and only the user controls the key. So, if Blockchain goes down, the wallet can be recovered using 1st party and 3rd party tools, like MultiBit.
Recently, BitPay has released Copay, which offers the benefits of Blockchain, as well as: 
- more security (multisig)
- more convenient backup (hierarchical deterministic wallet)
- more privacy (newly generated addresses for each transaction)
- more decentralized (no reliance on proprietary external servers)
So, at this point, I'm failing to see why Copay (for example) is not a secure solution (with 2FA enabled and a strong password, of course, and using the browser extension, not the web page), both for 'cold storage' and 'hot wallet' purposes.
Just waiting for the iOS app now, so I can use it on the go!

"expect massive price fixing and insider trading"
--  Can you explain what you're envisioning by this?
I ask, as my view... is that if Bitcoin continues to grow in acceptance, then it's a simple matter of demand and supply. Fixed supply (can't just print bitcoins out of thin air) and increasing demand, will mean that price WILL continue to increase. Due to this, it would seem that creation of ETFs and the ability to play financial tricks (naked short-selling, etc.) would have limited impact on Bitcoin. Price could not be suppressed artificially, if demand continued to increase (if an increasingly higher number of consumers wanted to use Bitcoins to pay for goods and services).

I guess so, but this confuses me.
Dashlane (and all password managers) are recommended widely, have tons of venture capital behind them, and are predicated on the fact they *won't* be hacked. So, assuming as you are that their chance of being hacked is high enough to not use them is concerning. People are storing ALL their passwords for EVERYTHING on these password managers. I'd assume they are secure enough to resist hacking, due to their encryption and 2FA, etc.
Is this really not the case? I'm having trouble grappling with acceptance of this idea in such a black/white sense.
@_date: 2014-11-21 01:18:05
You're missing my point. This isn't a battle of equals, with equal claims (like in the gas station example), nor does this have anything to do with capitalism.
Circle has always explicitly advertised that what makes them different is "no fees" from their end and that "money should be free". They even say "0" fee is being charged by them, when at the purchase screen.
So, my point is that this advertising is clearly false. There IS a fee; it's just integrated into the price they quote (which is around 0.4-0.8% higher, on average, than BitStamp market price).
In contrast, Coinbase quotes BitStamp's price, but then transparently adds a flat 1% fee on top, without any false claims of being free of charge (and thus making money from thin air).

Bits has already 'happened'. Get with the program.
On a related note, to you and anyone else posting spam on this thread with hate for bits: try to get out of your narrow frame of mind, and realize that it is far more intuitive for the mainstream masses to use bits than BTC or the nerd-like mBTC... i.e. Paying 5,000 bits for a cup coffee is far more reasonable than paying 0.005 BTC. It's more user friendly.
Just have some vision for goodness sake and stop thinking like a nerd or programmer, and more like a designer or marketer or psychologist.
This incessant anti-bits spam is quite juvenile, at this point.

Hmm, yeah, I'm not understanding. Can you clarify some things?
1. How is the Dashlane option vulnerable, if one uses 2FA with them? I don't yet know of a way that 2FA has been hacked. If a hacker does not have a 2FA token, then they can keylog all they want as I explained, and will only get the master password, which alone is useless without the 2FA code. Dashlane said they are vulnerable in the scenario that one is not using the 2FA option. I don't think I posted anything where they say that, in the scenario of a customer using 2FA, it is vulnerable.
2. You have mentioned key splitting, but I'm not understanding why key splitting (which sounds like much more work and thus more hassle) is superior, or significantly superior, to 2FA with an iPhone. You said "really!" it is the way to do it, but why? Please explain that. -- I mean, there has to be some justification to doing more work (key splitting), as opposed to less work (open 2FA app, generate 7 digit code, type code into other app that wants the code). I haven't heard of any vulnerability or hacks involving regular 2FA. On the contrary, every major Bitcoin company is using 2FA to help secure funds, including Circle, which mandates 2FA for every account.
So, if  checks out in terms of Dashlane w/ 2FA not being vulnerable, and  checks out in favor of 2FA over key splitting, then...
Using 2FA with breadwallet every time you open the app (as 2nd layer of protection, in addition to PIN or Touch ID), as well as whipping up coding magic to integrate 2FA into the 12-word backup seed restore process (in the same way Dashlane's master password requires 2FA, in order to move forward with decryption), would appear to be the logical and reasonable step to take.

I had a favorable impression of you, after the Circle/Coinbase/Xapo ToS insurance controversy, but what's up with you now? You literally sound like a troll from Buttcoin.
1. I mean, I can appreciate the sentiment of the OP, but it's pretty obvious that most of the points he made are nonsense. Just pure, total nonsense. So, this is not simply about 'legitimate criticisms' being posted, and ignored.
2. As for the 'troll attack', the 'jcoinner' guy simply asked for proof that OP purchased 700 BTC. Is that such a crime? If OP wants to be taken seriously, then it's a simple matter to produce evidence of the 700 BTC purchase. If OP cannot do that or is unwilling to do that, then it's not a stretch of the imagination to imagine OP is a troll, and that OP is posting with ulterior motives.

Those who are very knowledgeable about computer security, and thus Bitcoin wallet security, would suggest first looking at an iPhone wallet (only if not jailbroken) above all others.
This is because iOS is, by design, much more secure than Android, and much more secure than a desktop system (Mac, Windows). A user does not need to have extensive anti-malware knowledge, in other words.
Check out the posts of redditor aaronvoisine for more insight into security, and why iOS is much more recommended than Android and Mac/Windows.
In this vein, breadwallet (iPhone) is most recommended, for both ease of use and security. It's open source, but developed by Aaron Voisine.
If you don't have an iPhone, then using Coinbase or Circle (with 2FA and secondary passwords) is probably the next best option, but I'm not too sure about 'second best' after iOS.
@_date: 2014-12-01 00:26:39
The fact that use of Electrum is still vulnerable to malware/keyloggers on the system. In fact, even Coinbase is vulnerable in the same way, but maybe using their multisig vault with a 48-hour transfer-delay provides an opportunity to intervene.

Good point, regarding distinction between 'vault' and 'wallet'. However, perusing the Terms of Use shows this:


Here, 'Services' is defined to be Wallet and Vault, both.
Now, remember the original limited liability text...


Here, liability is defined to be connected to 'the occurrences described above'. This is found directly above this clause, and it is displayed in full, below:


Notice damages is shown to refer repeatedly only to "Services". Wallet and/or Vault, further, are not specified. Only the 'Services' distinction is used.
Hence, I think it's plausible to conclude the Vault has no special treatment, in the clause limiting liability to $100.

Hi hu5ndy, can you please support your claims? It seems you're making arguments that are not necessarily true.
For example, you said mobile phones should never be used to store large balances, but why not? breadwallet's creator argues that his app is specifically only being made available on iOS (not Android, not OS X, not Windows, not Linux), since iOS's 'walled garden' approach and variety of security measures actually makes the operating system highly secure, as compared to all other mainstream operating systems. I agree offline paper wallets are probably most secure for very large balances, but I don't agree with the rest of it.
Also, I just looked it up, and thankfully automatic app updates **can** be disabled on iOS.
Finally, as for 'rooting' the phone (or jailbreaking), this is an extremely bad idea, from a security standpoint, so it's very counter-productive.

Because if you actually look at various factors involved, it's a b.s. argument, as giszmo said.
Various reasons for the downvotes:
1. Miners are locating (by power of incentives) in cold regions, thus drastically lowering energy requirements (in the form of cooling for hot ASICs).
2. ASICs are getting more efficient every year.
3. The protocol can always be modified later, to incorporate a mix of PoS (proof of stake) and other proof types along with the current PoW (proof of work), which again would lower energy use, if it became an issue. On the latter note, Nick Szabo even tweeted recently that he would probably recommend a mix, as the best option, so it's not out of the realm of possibility.
4. Compare the Bitcoin network's energy use vs. energy use of other industries. It's absolutely infinitesimal in relative terms, which is all that really matters in the end.
5. This total product recall guy seems to be a regular troll.
@_date: 2014-12-08 05:56:35
Yeah, that would be convenient. But the developer of breadwallet states he'd never expand it to other platforms (except perhaps Android), since other platforms are very vulnerable to malware. He specifically only made it for iOS, since all apps are sandboxed from one another and the entire ecosystem is very tightly controlled (many other security features too, besides the app sandboxing) and protected against malware. Since security is paramount to dealing with Bitcoin (digital cash), it seems like a good decision.

Well, Bitstamp is not the only exchange... in fact, it's the exchange with the lowest volume (and thus quite low relevance) compared to the others (Bitfinex, OKCoin, Huobi, BTCChina). Prices hit $349 on average, when considering those 5 exchanges. Let's see, though.
I think I've come around to the idea that there will be no significant price appreciation, until at least mid-2015. (Unless some black swan event occurs). The reason, partly, is that everyone is fixated now on the history of Bitcoin's bubbles and how a bubble is expected now. That's not how markets work. In markets, often, 10% make money, and 90% lose money. The market will start bubbling up only after the majority have truly given up on a bubble.
The other problem with the story of Bitcoin price appreciation is that early adopters (or who knows who) are continually cashing out thousands of coins, every so often. This slumps the price, and prevents any positive sentiment from taking hold.
Not to mention merchants converting BTC to fiat, and miners creating new BTC out of thin air, and then selling much of that BTC for fiat to pay for operations. And... the shorters with leverage in regular markets, and the futures markets that also allow shorting without even interacting with the actual bitcoin asset.
Many, many fundamental headwinds.

Supposedly, it's basically secure and foolproof to use the breadwallet app on a non-jailbroken, fully up-to-date, iOS device. -- Just be sure to also take careful note of the backup key (12 words long), which is provided in the beginning of the wallet setup. Best would be to write it down on a piece of paper, and lock it up somewhere safe.
All those talking about paper wallets... I'm afraid I don't understand why that is being suggested. In paper form, Bitcoin is useless, in the sense it can't actually be used (spent).

A troll? I posted actual evidence and facts in my response, as to why Electrum is far inferior (less secure due to less secure operating system, and less usable/friendly interface) to a mobile iOS wallet (like breadwallet). What did you post?
The point is that the OP wanted information on Coinbase (absolutely incomparable to Mt. Gox in general, and after their multisig option granting control of the private key to the user, now Coinbase is almost equal to a standalone wallet), not a random explanation of Electrum. How do you know that OP did not want to cash out his tips, and that's why he wanted Coinbase? In such a case, you suggesting Electrum is completely irrelevant (and thus making you the troll).
Anyway, before you give opinions to newbies and act like you are an expert, first become an expert. That's all I'm saying. The things you are saying are just not accurate. I'm no expert either, but it seems I've certainly done a lot more of my homework than you have.

For a multitude of reasons, breadwallet (iOS only) is the best and most secure wallet... only third to a paper wallet, and Trezor.
All other platforms (OS X, Windows, Linux, Android) are difficult to truly secure and harden against malware; iOS is the only platform that by default, and when not jailbroken, is truly secure. And breadwallet is open source, very easy to use, and has many well-implemented security and privacy features. It's also in active development and the developer ( is experienced, knowledgeable, and readily accessible.
Blockchain.info used to be a good wallet, but in the last 1 year, there has been essentially no development, updates, etc. and instead, there have been various glitches and bugs and outages reported. It was my wallet of choice, but I don't trust their competence anymore.

"free instant p2p interbank transfers domestically"
-- In the U.S. I haven't seen any such thing. Plus, even in the cases you're citing, it's domestic only. Not international. For people with friends/family abroad or simply for those who travel abroad, not having to deal with currency conversion and having a simply method to pay with a global currency (bitcoin) is a benefit that nothing else has. Granted, this aspect is still being built out, but as adoption continues, you'll see more and more of this.
I disagree with the alt comment; I think it's mostly hype. See blockstream, factom, counterparty (with ethereum integrated), storj, etc. These few companies alone allow virtually anything to take place using Bitcoin... like all that futuristic stuff you hear about that involves 'programmable money' (business to business, machine to machine, machine to human, etc) that the recent Winklevoss presentation really, really spelled out well.
And the biggest benefit behind Bitcoin that you can try to explain to people is how it's simply 'better money' than virtually ANY other form of money in existence (effect = it will likely maintain its value much better than holding a fiat currency, or holding precious metals). Yes, it's new (and inherently volatile as a result: the volatility is 100% natural and a good thing indicating health and organic growth), but it is superior and, being superior, it has legitimate value. Value eventually is recognized and accepted. Its ecosystem, the players behind it, and the money invested into it have created momentum, and only increase the chances that this 'new' technology will survive and continue to grow. This whole 'history of money' thing is how Bitcoin is typically presented by the experts, if you'll notice, in their videos. The reason is it is extremely significant. The deeper point of Bitcoin is what makes it so special, of course in addition to everything else.
On the above note, to expand... one thing I haven't really seen before is a better comparison of Bitcoin vs. Gold vs. Fiat. Fiat has intrinsic value in the sense the government's tax ability and military exists. But, bitcoin also DOES have intrinsic value, and this intrinsic value will only grow, as opposed to the lack of intrinsic value of gold. This is because bitcoin is not actually pure currency as we all know, but rather a 'token' of sorts that can be used in many different contexts and with a massive computing network backing it, providing incredible security and power. Gold has no such thing, or minimal intrinsic value (jewelry mainly, but it represents a tiny portion). So, in the comparison of Gold vs. Bitcoin (the only two alternatives to fiat that are not vulnerable to inflation), Bitcoin wins even in the intrinsic value department! And Bitcoin will only continue to increase in intrinsic value as the ecosystem develops even further and adoption rises. It's a massive virtuous circle, in my eyes, with many positive feedback loops. I find this significant, since there is currently about $7 trillion USD stored in gold, making it ripe to be eaten into by Bitcoin (because it's an objectively superior store of value), as time passes.
Anyway, I wrote more than I intended, but hope it helps.

I recommend breadwallet on iOS. Just write on paper the 12-word backup you get when first setting up the wallet, and lock that paper up in some sort of safe or somewhere else that is secure (encrypted digital password manager, like Dashlane?).
Why breadwallet?
- Much more secure (since iOS is far more secure, than a mainstream OS on a desktop computer)
- Much less headache (with servers going down or being glitchy, since breadwallet is decentralized and SPV)
- Much more functional (than a paper wallet)
- and many more reasons: see breadwallet.com

Agreed, but the comments are still useful, to gain insight into what mainstream people think, so as to hopefully address those issues with future iterations of Bitcoin.
1-3% Points rewards could be compensated by direct 1-3% merchant discounts, maybe Bitcoin can evolve from QR codes to NFC for POS transactions in stores?, and so on...
I know it's disappointing that people can be so dogmatic and anti-change/new things, but that's just how most people are. For Bitcoin to gain mass adoption, it has to win over them. Apple fanboys partly like Apple because, to put it simply, Apple has a way of making its UI/UX intuitive, easy on the eyes, and actually fun to use, without any abstractness or complexity, while still providing functionality and high technology.
From that, there is much Bitcoin can learn (see the horrific UI/UX of MultiBit, Armory, etc. that continues to persist even today!). The technology is inherently great, but now it needs to be packaged into a drop-dead simple and intuitive package along every point in the chain of acquiring, using, and securing bitcoins. It's happening, but it has to keep happening and improve further.

You ask what wallet to use now, since blockchain.info is not safe. In other words, you prioritize safety. Yet then, at the same time, you remove breadwallet from consideration, due to "high fee" (3 cents). wtf?
I think you need to figure out your priorities, and the whole point of switching away from blockchain.info. If you're willing to skip paying 3 cents, in exchange for not using a very well-regarded and safe wallet, then you have your priorities entirely wrong.
P.S. In the next update due very soon, breadwallet is reducing the minimum fee to adjust automatically between 10-100 bits (0.3 cents to 3 cents), based on the transaction. That's not the point of my post though.
@_date: 2014-09-28 03:18:06
Understood, and I really do agree with this idealistic, Utopic vision. However, is it not practical? Some people are not intelligent enough to secure their Bitcoin properly, even with open-source tools, so they will require a 3rd party. Some people are too busy with their job/life, so they literally lack time, to spend to become an expert on this matter and secure their Bitcoin, and so require a 3rd party.
I mean, to you and me, we are technologically inclined, interested, motivated, curious, open-minded, savvy, to do all this and think about these things. But think about the mainstream masses? This is why I think there will always be a role to be played by 3rd parties: ranging from completely trusted (closed-source, no time/effort/user thinking required, managed by a company and employees and customer service reps), to fully trust-less (open-source Bitcoin wallet that can be used at a constant version without updating, thus preventing the threat of insidious updates, but must be on a secured platform, and without any assistance from the developer), to a middle-path model (open source, but with continuing regular updates through a trusted/open-source model).
Sorry for rambling a bit; I hope I made some sort of sense? I'm not sure where breadwallet falls, but it seems to be the middle-path model. There's always the worry, that if you trust a developer, the developer could suddenly push a malicious update and, before there is time to notice the bad code, steal all user funds and run.
Do you think this is a valid fear? Do you think it is countered, however, and rendered null and void, if there is sufficient transparency, as to the developer's personal information (name, address, etc.), so that the developer cannot necessarily run with funds anonymously?
Is there something within Bitcoin that, if implemented within a wallet,  can prevent the above scenario from playing out? By removing control from the developer to do such a thing? Or are we forever going to be at a developer's mercy?
IF... that ^ **cannot** be ever solved technically, then this may be an advantage of either:
- Going with a big corporation's wallet, since they have much more at stake and are publicly known (can't run as easily), or...
- Stop updating your Bitcoin wallet, at some point, once its satisfactorily stable and feature-rich. Of course, the wallet must be created in a decentralized and self-contained fashion, such that it does not require any service run by the developer, in order to operate.
@_date: 2014-12-03 03:19:58
I don't think Bitcoin's 'inflation' is relevant, since the exact rate of inflation is known beforehand (along with halvings), as well as the maximum amount of bitcoins. The supply of bitcoins is known at every point in its future. In fact, the supply of bitcoins is structured to increase at a decreasing rate (halvings). Hence, it's deflationary.
Inflation is only really relevant, if/when the inflation rate is unpredictable and there is no fixed cap to the monetary base. If it's predictable, wages and other market forces adjust to match the inflation.
In fact, due to all this, the next halving shouldn't really impact price much, since the market knows and expects the production rate to change in a set manner. It won't be a surprise to the market, so maybe it will be priced in by then (if it isn't already priced in).

I think this is a really fascinating issue. I've tried to explain Bitcoin to many different types of people, with mixed results.
The ones who are really educated and make tons of money (doctors, mainly) seem to universally have an instinctive reaction that Bitcoin is essentially a waste of time and a 'scam', for lack of a better word. A professor I spoke to has kids involved in computers and robotics, who have explored Bitcoin in past years and told her, so she was very positive and open. Others (in the 'highly educated' category) mostly don't really see the value, but they are open to learning.
The common middle class people (Uber drivers, regular normal everyday people) seem to either be quite open to learning, or in the case of one small business restaurant, the owners were very very suspicious and said, "Money is already getting less 'real' every day, so we don't need this too now".
As for myself, I originally dismissed it utterly and completely, when an 'acquaintance' first told me about it and was proselytizing its virtues about 2-3 years ago. I did not even consider it long enough to look into it. It must have just seemed very unbelievable, 'too good to be true', 'cult-ish' (huge part of it, since emotionally when my friend told me, he was a big conspiracy guy too and he was speaking very 'feverishly', so I really didn't even take him seriously), spammy, and a waste of time.
What changed my stance is when that same friend a while later tried a 'social experiment' and sent 0.5 BTC to whoever requested it and explained why. I did it, because free money so what the heck? I remember the first time I heard the beep in my blockchain.info account and saw it arrive, it felt like magic. I was pretty ecstatic, to put it lightly. Ever since then, I was converted, and have been kicking myself for not being more open-minded when I was first introduced such a long time before then.
What I think my acquaintaince/friend should have done differently, and what anyone should do differently is this: Preface the explanation of Bitcoin by admitting how big a deal it really is. Say upfront that it is a topic with vast implications, and there is a lot one could potentially learn/read on this. It's not a simple thing. Then, just give the person the option to either a) hear you teach them the mountains of info about it, or b) give them only practical information/benefits that affect them directly. Either way, emphasize security, and remember that every person is different. Be calm, give time to be asked questions, and just run through it in a methodical manner.
And of course, demo the actual technology!! Install breadwallet (iOS) on the other person's phone immediately, and let them see the simplicity, and witness the magic occur in real time at the speed of light.

Interesting, thanks for bringing this up!
I went through the thread, but it's not clear to me where the problem lies.
The OP does not say if his iPhone is jailbroken. If it is, then that is the problem, since jailbreaking seems to eliminate the default security put into place that sandboxes apps from one another. The OP does not say, either, if his phone is fully updated, or if he's running an ancient iOS version. It's also not clear if the OP is using Tor and suffered via a bad Tor exit node.
The other possibility it seems is a Masque/WireLurker attack against the device. Surprisingly, Masque even affects non-jailbroken devices. That's the first time I've heard of this being possible.
In any case, I've messaged breadwallet's creator and asked him to look into it, so we can expect a more thorough analysis shortly. Regardless, the good news is that apps are all designed differently, even if iOS security has been penetrated in this instance by Masque, breadwallet may not necessarily be vulnerable, due to its design and extra security precautions. But if it is vulnerable, then I'm glad you brought it up, so it can hopefully be updated, to make it invulnerable against this category of exploit.

breadwallet's next update (coming very soon) will have TouchID, among many other new features and inprovements. Also, do the comparison for yourself? breadwallet is far superior to this BitStore wallet... and especially in the ways that matter (security).

Better to stick with the tried and tested (breadwallet), and wait for more user/developer feedback on this app, considering it is brand new. Or, do your own research and compare the two, if you're technically minded.

'User error'?
Sorry, I must be missing something. Are we not actually in favor of mainstream adoption, then?
How about having wallets with GOOD design that removes ability of the user to make most mistakes? That abstracts the complexity away? That makes use of existing systems, to aid in this respect? Users can't be expected to know computer security. That's a truly absurd notion. So yes, we *should* be making this about which 3rd party to trust, since that 3rd party has to be knowledgeable about security, competent, and design-savvy, to make the right decisions and design the right user interface.
What have I discovered, after much research and consideration and consternation, that addresses the above? And that has many other new features being worked on right now for an upcoming update, that will blow competing wallets out of the water?
**Breadwallet for iOS, by Aaron Voisine.**
I knew about this for ages, but always discounted it due to the amateur sounding name (bread?), so I just trusted the 'pros' and used Blockchain.info -- but after finally doing my own research, I realized I'd been living in the dark ages and exposing myself to risk, *unnecessarily*.

I've been seeing a lot of such posts in the last couple days, relating to losing Bitcoin from blockchain.info. Frankly, I'm not surprised. Maybe, there has been a hacking spree?
Do you use 2FA and have the secondary password enabled?
Blockchain.info has been behaving in an incompetent manner with their iOS wallet, which has all kinds of bugs; the latest bug means the last update crashes upon launch! No testing at all before release, apparently. And the web wallet hasn't received any update at all basically, in months or years, despite all the new BIPs and security features incorporated into other wallets.

Clearly you didn't hear about Counterparty incorporating Ethereum's code (and running on top of Bitcoin's blockchain), thereby making Ethereum obsolete. Nor did you hear about Blocksteam and its sidechains project (VC funded with $30 million), with those sidechains allowing any alt coin to instead be linked to and run via Bitcoin's blockchain.

Thank you very much for this thread, OP! It's a true PSA, if there ever was one. I just came across Shillslayer's comments on this matter and I can't express how disappointed I was to learn the truth about this.
This thread needs to be made the  thread on so the word can get out, and so these unscrupulous companies don't devastate the ecosystem by abusing users' trust, in the event they capsize.
**One Mt. Gox incident of breach of trust was more than enough.**
P.S. The moral of this story may be that bitcoins can truly only be 'insured' through personal responsibility and direction. Seeking an easy way out by trusting a custodian may be a fool's errand. In this regard, Trezor may be a good option, as it's open source, but only as long as the software and hardware are verified to be clean and uncompromisable by a hypothetical future malicious software update.

Great thread. It nicely and concisely makes a lot of great points!
I'm curious about your opinion on breadwallet on iOS (and wallet security in general). It is a 3rd party tool, of course, but does it... being open-source, decentralized, SPV, located on a secure encrypted platform (iOS), etc. etc... tip the balance into making it a good tool to use to transact Bitcoin, in your opinion?
I believe... if the mainstream is to use Bitcoin, then the mainstream CANNOT be expected to be able to invest the time and energy needed to secure a digital currency like Bitcoin, on their own, which includes a secure wallet and a secure system that is hosting the wallet (no malware).
How do you feel, what do you think?
@_date: 2014-11-30 05:05:05
re: 1
Check out onename.io. They received venture capital funding and are going fully open-source and expanding, and are integrating stealth address technology.
re: 2
Completely agree.
On a related note, breadwallet (by Aaron Voisine) was the first to firmly lead the charge in this direction (of bits), despite great opposition at the time (and to some extent, still). Breadwallet was, incidentally, the first iOS SPV client, directly connecting to the Bitcoin network. Aaron is extremely knowledgeable and forward-thinking (has vision, is creative). As such, I'd recommend people use breadwallet, to stay on the forefront of Bitcoin wallet technology/security.

I'm sorry, but your answer to OP was almost completely irrelevant. OP specifically asked about Coinbase; he did not ask for options and a big advertisement or explanation for Electrum.
Not to mention, you suggest Electrum on a computer is the best option. It isn't. A wallet like 'breadwallet' on iOS is the most secure, following paper wallets and hardware wallets like Trezor. Windows/Mac is far more vulnerable to malware, while non-jailbroken iOS is essentially not vulnerable for various reasons (app sandboxing, code signing, default hardware encryption, etc).
So, an iOS wallet like breadwallet is much more secure for the vast majority, and especially for a newbie, and also far more user friendly and simple to use (important for anyone, but especially for the OP, who describes himself as new) than something like Electrum.
@_date: 2014-12-01 01:43:19
Try to think a little bigger than only yourself... and it's crystal clear.
What about the mainstream, the masses who are utterly un-tech-savvy and get phished and hacked to no end? Electrum, et. al are unintuitive, not (masses) user friendly, and require hardening a system against malware/keyloggers.
What typical person is going to: a) find an "old unused computer", b) figure out how to set up Electrum on it, c) "sign transactions offline", etc etc? It's utterly absurd.
The point is to come up with a system that *anyone* can use securely.

I agree with Please, Greg, write a series of blog posts similar to that can put a highly visible public dimension to your thoughts and philosophy. You make very good points, but they need to be formalized in the same way as the other side to have equal weight with the 'public'.

You're here to 'educate others'? Don't. You don't know enough to go around 'educating' anyone.

"Fortunately coinbase now lets you create a multisig vault, which means you have access to your own private keys, so you can be your own bank with them as well"

You could do the same thing, far more easily and with far less chance of malware interference, with the breadwallet app on iOS (a secure, closed ecosystem OS, virtually invulnerable to malware):
Download breadwallet, turn on airplane mode, open breadwallet, generate new wallet, write down seed, take a screenshot of the receive address/QR code (for receiving funds to the cold wallet), delete the wallet just created, delete breadwallet.
(I'm pretty sure this would be 100% cold, since the new wallet's seed is not generated until breadwallet is launched for the first time and a new wallet started)

Safari backs up all browser settings and content via iCloud, so there is no worry about losing it. And yep, it's easy to 'search' the bookmarks via the Safari's bookmark manager in case there is a need. But realistically speaking, I've been doing this for so long and almost never have a chance to revisit any of those bookmarked sessions with hundreds of tabs. I persist in the behavior though, because I can't really make myself simply discard the tabs. I guess their only use is, like you said, as a reference to search through if needed since the bookmarks are valuable in the sense they represent curated content.

Yup, I agree, and that's a great mentality to have! I was more just making you aware of this technology.
It's best to learn from the other approaches, and use them to improve your product. Then, you can couple it with a value add (personalized customer service, and tailored solutions), which customers find worth paying a small fee for instead of having to "figure it out on their own" (i.e. with a product like Virtual Notary that doesn't come with support staff).

If 3 is a concern (and due to curcumstances, I'd say it's highly unlikely to be), the possibility is already priced in by the market.
By the way, as far as "people want choice", most people want to use a network with the largest size, due to all the benefits of the larger network. That is what makes network effect significant. So, I can't imagine why any nonbiased person (aka person not already invested in Monero) would choose to transact/use Monero vs. Bitcoin's Monero sidechain. So yes, people want choice. But people want to choose between legitimate options (in this case, currencies with equal benefit... benefit in this case meaning network effect).

This was spoken metaphorically, with the CEO speaking about Bitcoin from Coinbase's perspective, which is of course shaped by the US regulatory climate. Lose some of the illegal uses (1% of transactions), and replace those with legal uses (99% of transactions).
Bitcoin's protocol cannot be changed by regulators nor by Coinbase; only centralized services on top of Bitcoin, like Coinbase, can be regulated and made to follow ID rules, etc.


Again, this is impossible. Coinbase can do absolutely nothing to change the protocol itself, so I am 99.9% sure the CEO was not referring to that since its not logical.

Imagine if just 4 million other people also bought 2 bitcoins, just like you did. (Or 8 million purchasing 1 bitcoin.)
Besides the fact that we have about 13 million bitcoins in circulation and those final 8 million will take another 10-100 years to be fully available, and besides the fact that there aren't even 8 million bitcoins available on market exchanges to buy, such an occurrence would remove the the remaining supply of bitcoins.
'4 million' people is not even that high an amount. I can't imagine the consequences. If Blockchain.info has 2.5 million users, Coinbase has 2 million users, and Circle has, say, 500,000 users, that's still 5 million people who are already involved with Bitcoin, to some extent. And this figure ignores those around the world who use other wallets, or who use other exchanges, to purchase their bitcoins!
I can't imagine how each of these minimum 5 million don't want to own at least 1 bitcoin, and how/why it's not been reflected in the market. Maybe, this simply means we have far fewer than 5,000,000 *active/real* users. BUT! If market growth occurs at the pace that typical growth of network-effect-technology occurs, then I can't fathom how we couldn't relatively quickly hit the milestone of 'millions' of 'real' and 'active' Bitcoin-users, who would then want to purchase 'at least' 1 bitcoin, which would then drain supply quickly.
This also raises another important point. Bitcoin only needs, for example, 4-8 million people with intent to purchase 1-2 bitcoins, in order for Bitcoin to become viable and succeed as a unit of account. The entire population does not even need to be persuaded and urged to understand and learn about it. Just 4-8 million people, globally.
When that happens, the Bitcoin economy will become more self-sustaining and independent of the fiat system, as the price will be astronomical, meaning it will have real value and consequently be valued by others, on a psychological basis. Similarly, supply/demand will finally be taut and able to absorb movement of bitcoins into/out of the market without significant volatility, thus resulting in stability. Bitcoin is also designed to function independently of regulation (unlike many things in life). It's self-sustaining as it is, it's independent and decentralized (using breadwallet, for example, instead of Circle/Coinbase). It has all necessary ingredients encoded within, to allow its use in the economy. And with the monetary value (and hence further developer attention, and attention from technologists) it gains via appreciation, Bitcoin would also be able to grow to fulfill its potential in the other arenas.
I mean, we have extremely high attention from all groups! Software developers, hardware developers, politicians, bankers, central bankers, designers, intellectuals, economists, media, philosophers, political groups, venture capitalists, Silicon Valley as a whole, young affluent U.S. Millennials, and other groups that I'm sure I'm forgetting.
It would take just 4-8 million people, from this vast group, to actively decide to each purchase just 1 bitcoin.
Put simply, Bitcoin is the real deal as anyone, who has truly done his/her homework on this technology and its potential, knows. I'm not speaking of demand for 1 bitcoin from people, as a way to figure out how to scam people into buying it. Bitcoin is truly legit, and by its inherent merits, it deserves to be acquired.
**Unless I'm missing something, it would defy logic for these events to *not* occur. But, barring catastrophic flaws or failures induced by regulation, etc etc, of course... any reasons why this series of events would not occur eventually (and logically speaking and when considering the rate of development/funding, relatively soon, maybe within 5 years)?**
P.S. I agree about the 'saving' aspect mentioned in the original thread post. It's all part of the deflationary aspect of how Bitcoin is designed :). On a large scale, it may result in a shift towards a much healthier economy in the long-term (because the lower &amp; middle classes, who already don't earn much yet spend like maniacs and get into debt, would be incentivized, due to deflationary money, to save a more significant portion of their salary), as well as a healthier planet due to less waste of natural resources (due to over-production/-consumption incentivized by inflationary fiat).

The sad thing is I don't really think Bitcoin has much recourse, if a sufficiently determined and well-funded adversary decided to try to attack the network while it is still a baby.
A mere 10% of this *one* guy's net worth ($700 million out of $7 billion = ~3,000,000 bitcoins at a rate of $235 = ~20% of outstanding bitcoins = 35x the average daily bitcoin trading volume of ~$20 million) would be more than plenty to heavily short bitcoin to obscurity, and destroy maybe 99% of the ecosystem's/community's faith.
Besides a wealth benefactor stepping in to save the day (and yes, we have quite a few billionaires and well-funded VC firms favorably interested in bitcoin), the only other better option to counter such a scenario would be a much higher adoption rate, since higher adoption = more liquidity = less negative impact to the exchange rate. But, we are obviously not 'there' yet, and I'm not going to bet on a magical unicorn benefactor.
(And, of course, this is just a financially-powered attack. There are other modes of attack, too.)

Implement the preconditions required for Lightning:
@_date: 2015-05-31 15:23:11
(Correct me if I'm wrong on any point, and does *not* assume any such thing though. Trivializing the opposing viewpoint with a false assumption does nothing to constructively advance discussion.
In his posts, Greg has been clear about his points.
1. Scalability is only possible through a Lightning-style implementation, but we do not have Lightning yet.
2. Increasing block size is a never-ending move and does not solve scalability, while it does hinder users from running full nodes via bandwidth constraint. (Though on this point, I'd argue that perhaps the bigger factor is not bandwidth but rather disk space, which is maybe solved recently through pruning, etc. and needs time to become evident through a higher node count? On the other hand, a 20 MB block in 10 min still appears to be an issue, as it's a 20x increase in bandwidth which is not trivial).
3. The network is actually fine as is, and so rather than harming the network by increasing blocksize, he is advocating waiting until a true scalability approach is developed and/or until we actually are forced to increase blocksize, if/when transactions actually reach the 2.5-3 TPS limit; right now we are ~1.2 TPS.
But then, why wait? Why not increase size right now, if we know we will have to eventually increase it to some degree? Presumably, this:
* Allow internet bandwidth globally time to continue to increase, so as to lessen the negative decentralization impact generated by increasing blocksize (which increases bandwidth requirement).
I'll also point out something about 'consensus':


I think this is a very insightful comment with a lot of wisdom condensed into few words. Please read it carefully and understand it. It makes sense. If we assume the community is not monolithic (and it isn't), then we want to generate precedent to act in a way that generates maximum consensus. Forking can **not** be an option; so the XT idea seems 'undesirable'. One simple way to generate consensus on an ambiguous issue with opposing priorities like this one is to simply wait until there is a true clear problem to solve. So, rather than now, maybe wait 6 months and if transaction counts continue to climb upward and start causing issues, then an emergency patch (which can be made ready now, in advance) can be implemented "within days" if need be, with full consensus.
More on consensus:

It's an ongoing problem for the entire last year, though; this is not a one-off issue.
They have not updated the wallet with new technology that has been developed and adopted by major competitors, nor have they improved security (by default) for users. Further, they are completely out of touch: they think making a blog post, on how to improve security settings (i.e. increasing PDFK2 iterations), is sufficient for security, and is going to magically translate into users reading the blog post and manually changing settings themselves. Everything I've seen about the company demonstrates incompetence and technology/security stasis, at every level.
I'm saying all this having used blockchain.info as my first wallet, and being completely wow-ed when I first used it. The more you understand the development in the Bitcoin industry though, the more it's obvious that they have fallen terribly behind and have just been resting on their laurels for a long time now.

Right, of course the 21 mining chip is not about Bitcoin.
That's why the company's announcement was titled "A *bitcoin* miner in every device and in every hand", why the announcement had the word *"Bitcoin"* appearing in almost every paragraph, and why the company was named '21' specifically because of *Bitcoin's* 21-million-unit cap.
Please use some common sense. No offense but this post is total nonsense, starting from the title and continuing throughout the entire post.
Please read up on the state of the art of Bitcoin technology (one example: fees for on-chain transactions are not 0.0001 btc, but rather 0.00001 btc as of a few months ago; and besides, 'on-chain transactions' are not the only type of transaction), then reevaluate these assumptions.

Yes, at $50,000/btc, he would be worth $15 billion (not one of the richest by any stretch, but certainly up there). You say it like it's a bad thing. What is the problem with that? According to the article, he gained his wealth by being literally one of the first major investors in Bitcoin companies (aka, he invested his money when it was most risky, and thus was instrumental in growing the ecosystem at its most fragile moment). Fortune favors the bold.
By the way, where do you get your 300,000 btc figure? I wouldn't really expect it to be accurate (probably hearsay?), unless there is a clear primary source.

You're missing the point. The point is that if a phone with the current version of breadwallet is stolen, the phone can be jailbroken and the PIN and 12-word seed stolen. 
First sentence of the linked post:


Other key parts:










Basically, what Breadwallet claims (all sensitive data is protected by the secure enclave during a jailbreak) turns out to not actually be true. It's pretty disappointing this error was made, since this is a simple attack (jailbreaking) and leaves a user's breadwallet funds vulnerable.
@_date: 2014-11-24 23:23:24
Also, security! In fact, my  reason for using breadwallet on iOS (only on a non-jailbroken iPhone that is fully updated, for security reasons) is the high security it offers, while still remaining super simple to use, compared to Electrum, Armory, etc.
It's also nice from a privacy perspective, since it generates a new 'receive address and QR code' every time you receive money from someone. It does not 'reuse' addresses.
It's also amazing from a backup perspective, since you don't have to email yourself backups. The way backups work is you are given a 12-word 'seed' (just 12 words basically). If you ever lose your phone or lose access to your money on breadwallet, you can literally download breadwallet again, tap the 'restore backup' option, enter those 12 words, and your money is back.
Really, there are too many good things to even remember or have the time to list them all, and there are updates incoming to even further make it better :).
Google 'breadwallet' and just read everything you can about it and watch the YouTube video lecture (it's about 1 hour long) given by the developer describing it in detail; that's what I did.

About that:
* The source of the audio is elux who presumably knows the engineer, which is why the guy spoke to the group in the first place. (this point is in dispute; the engineer 'thrive' may not know elux; motive of 'thrive' to speak to the group is unclear)
* elux titled the audio as "21 inc embedded engineer".
* It's not said anywhere that the engineer does *not* work for 21.
* The engineer's comments are directly in line with/relevant to everything expected with 21/bitcoin/ethereum dApps/mining/crypto, so the engineer is clearly mired in the space (and more likely connected to a company of 21's specialty than the others).
* The engineer said he is "a hardware engineer working on the embedded btc in a chip". It would seem likely that only a 21 employee was working on the chip itself, as Intel, Qualcomm, et. al are only investors/partners (maybe even manufacturers of the chip, in the case of Intel with its chip foundries) at this point. It is 21 whose expertise/mission lies with designing the BitShare chip.
Hence, I think it's a fair bet and more likely than not that the engineer does work for 21.

I believe the main benefit is that it pushes Bitcoin further into the mainstream. Paypal is widely known and recognized and used, so having Paypal, in effect, endorse Bitcoin, helps give Bitcoin credibility to the common person. People can't so easily ridicule Bitcoin and write it off as simply being Silk Road money and a Ponzi scheme scam, when a company like Paypal is publicly treating it seriously.

Interesting, thanks for the insight. I guess it's possible that the emotional feeling among a subset of people of an asset being "overvalued" could manifest as an almost-identical asset (which is perceived as "just as good" as the original) achieving and retaining some degree of value.

Reading the comments on this Facebook post, it is horribly depressing how stupid the general public is, or at least the subset of the general public that comments on online articles, blog posts, etc. Sometimes, it makes me lose all hope that a technology as complex and anti-"norm" as Bitcoin will ever penetrate their thick skulls deep enough to allow for mass adoption.
Since you claim to have experience with the early internet, do you have hope for Bitcoin succeeding in spite of the narrow-mindedness and frankly complete stupidity/gullibility of the masses?

Fantastic article! Thanks so much for linking it. Definitely a lot of food for thought, which I'll have to ponder more.
But for now, a quick skim reveals the author is not necessarily examining the issue objectively in terms of the "new system's" costs &amp; benefits vs. the reality of current governance's costs &amp; benefits, at least as far as the part on Balaji is concerned. Watch the full video of Balaji's speech on Voice vs. Exit, if you haven't, and you'll see what I mean.
Balaji was not forcing anyone to join his hypothetical future tech utopian society (alluded to, when the author darkly mentions "corporate mini cities") or even inviting anyone; he was making a point that citizens have 2 choices when presented with a broken system (whether the system is: a monopoly by Microsoft, or a broken political system): voice (speaking/acting to try to get change enacted to fix a broken system), or if voice does not work or is not possible, then exit (leaving the system and creating a new one).
Exit, of course, requires certain preconditions to be viable, one of which is a decentralized currency that works anywhere and everywhere. Enter Bitcoin.

Sorry, I meant a fork that occurs in the face of significant opposition and despite lack of supermajority (&gt; 80%) consensus. Soft forks and hard forks with consensus are of course fine and dandy, and necessary to grow and upgrade the protocol as new information and circumstances arise.
And yes, I completely agree we should not fight 'forks'. I don't think anyone is opposed to forks btw; it's just difficult to achieve consensus and overcome inertia to implement a fork. One idea is to have semi-regular scheduled hard forks, say every 6 months (to help keep Bitcoin malleable and upgradeable, and lessen the severity of trauma typically associated with a hard fork).
@_date: 2015-05-02 01:16:10
We know better, but... until Bitcoin reaches $1,000 and remains confidently above $1,000, the masses can continue to argue (within reason) that Bitcoin may still be a Ponzi scheme and fraud. From someone who is not involved in the space and only sees the massive price fluctuations, it is not too hard to understand this line of reasoning.
Until we reach $1,000 again (and even after, really -- humility is a virtue, right?), I think it would be wise for the Bitcoin community to restrain its unbridled confidence, since it otherwise borders on hubris and even lunacy. Let's reserve the jubilation and backslapping, until success is definitively achieved (defined as, at a minimum, reaching and holding the previous all-time-high price -- thereby effectively nullifying claims that Bitcoin is just a Ponzi scheme, fraud, etc.).
I've observed comments by others where, in general, it seems that the lack of a solid or apparent "price floor" (to prevent the bottom from falling out) is what is preventing many from investing or buying bitcoins. Such an asset class has never existed, so this psychological problem is very real. This is what makes it all the more important that the price recovers the prior ATH (to instill confidence).

Well said, and this is directly in line with 21's statements. I think most people are misunderstanding 21's vision and the purpose of their chip. They seem to be playing the long game, by tying together bitcoin (as the value transfer unit), IoT (hardware &amp; software), and micropayments (in all forms, most of which are yet to emerge, and will first require properly networked IoT infrastructure). There should be frankly unlimited potential here, which makes this extremely exciting.
*More on the 'micropayment' angle, which I think is key to this whole thing. The reason 21's plans don't seem to make any sense is because we have not yet experienced true micropayments.*
The word "micropayment" has the prefix micro-, which is a unit of value that is 1/1,000,000 of the base unit. Thus, if we think of a payment as normally being an average of $10-100, then a micropayment in the true sense of the word would be something like $0.00001-$0.0001. This would logically have been the original intention when the word was coined. However, due to technical problems (cost of transferring traditional fiat), real micropayments are/were not possible. But now, Bitcoin makes it possible.
The history of micropayments is explained in more detail on Wikipedia, which gives some context:

Proof of such a motive?? I don't know where you're getting this from, *at all*.
The CEO of 21, Balaji S., is one of the biggest Bitcoin proponents in Silicon Valley and frankly a genius thinker and visionary. He (arguably along with Wences C., though to a lesser extent) personally has been responsible for early on getting most of Silicon Valley's top tech company CEOs and brightest minds (including VC Andresen Horowitz and its partners) onboard with Bitcoin as *the* cryptocurrency, and he (21) is now partnering (financially, organizationally, etc.) with them all, to advance 21's actual *and only stated* vision of boosting consumer adoption of Bitcoin and making the protocol (and, by default, the currency) mainstream.
Are you really being arrogant enough to assume that Balaji would seek to "obtain near total control of both the network and the wallets" to the detriment of the network? Are you suggesting he does not understand the ethos behind Bitcoin, and what even makes this entire ecosystem click (open source, decentralization, consensus, opt-in, freedom, cypherpunk, etc.)?
I really think you (and anyone else, who harbors doubts about 21's motivations and/or Balaji's motivations) should do some research on the guy, and become much better informed before opining.
Some starting points:








Please get a grip. You are also a mod, after all :\, so we (I?) expect better.
**p.s.** I responded later in this thread (actually only 2 posts down, but it seems people are missing it) with the idea that besides people (Balaji and co.), the incentives for 21 to operate a successful distributed mining operation are also aligned with maintaining a healthy, vibrant Bitcoin protocol and ecosystem.

Wow, I didn't know this. If true for all available jailbreaks (which would then also give a high likelihood of future jailbreaks also not bypassing the unlock requirement), then this is really great news and cements the importance of having a secure iPhone PIN.
1. Does this mean an external party jailbreaking a stolen phone would fail to access the breadwallet PIN or seed, assuming a 4-digit PIN is set on the phone and the phone was not jailbroken to begin with (i.e. phone still has default restrictions on PIN attempts)?
2. What about if a 10-digit PIN was used; does that make any difference? I remember reading a longer iPhone PIN does grant higher security.
3. Do you know the minimum length PIN to use to achieve 'strong' security (if we assume longer PIN improves security, which maybe it doesn't if PIN attempt restrictions are in effect anyway..?)?

Of course, we can just say: it depends. After all, we do not know exactly what their plan is with regard to amassing mining power via their low-cost 'subsidized' mining. It seems like a perfect recipe for mining domination ($7 something in cost to mine?).
**However, I believe people matter and incentives matter.** Remember Satoshi's genius inclusion of game theory within the Bitcoin ecosystem. It applies here.
This is why I am arguing that it is instrumental to keep in mind the central figure in charge of 21, Balaji. Based on what I've learned about him, I don't think he is stupid enough (or even cynical or disconnected enough from tech + bitcoin) to risk the integrity/stability/health of Bitcoin (and thus 21's business model).
Remember, 21's business model is mining-centric as far as we know, so it *depends* on:






The incentives for 21 and the personal nature of Balaji are all just completely unaligned with jeopardizing Bitcoin's mining pool ratio, or unduly jostling for influence over the protocol. Instead, the incentives are strongly, strongly, strongly aligned with the former list: high exchange rate, adoption, goodwill.

Personally, when I browse the web, I start off with a few tabs open by default that I'm monitoring off and on, such as: Gmail, Google Calendar, and the like. Then, if I choose to browse or NYT or Twitter or whatever, I first open up in tabs everything on the page that looks interesting. However, each link often ends up sparking various questions and that one link spawns a few other links and maybe even a Google search. Then, maybe one of those branches spawns a few more branches? It becomes a never-ending cycle because my curiosity/questions are infinite and information is also infinite. I try to deal with it by multitasking between the tabs and/or prioritizing what I read next. By the end of the day, I guess the lowest priority tabs end up being bookmarked, for possible review in some nebulous future with infinite time.
By the way, the issue of "too small to read the title of open tabs" does not apply. I use Safari, which deals with open tabs differently and leaves each tab's title readable. Here's a screenshot of what I mean:

No more having to back up wallet files (ancient technology), and no more risk of having your wallet file hacked.

Hi, good to know, so then this eliminates my first 2 points. But points 3-5 still stand, so it's a higher likelihood that 'thrive' works for 21 than not, or with a partner.
Either way, since he is directly involved as a hardware engineer on the BitShare chip, I think he'd be qualified to know what he is talking about (directly as a 21 engineer, or indirectly as a 21-partner engineer). He also does clearly state when he does or doesn't know something in the audio, so from what he said, I still think my thread title is fine.
But thanks for the additional info, I've updated my prior post. If you find evidence that 'thrive' does not work for 21 or for a partner of 21 on the chip, then I'll be happy to update my post and this thread with the new information.

Well, normal fee rate of mined transactions averages 20-40 satoshis/byte (45-90 bits for typical 225-byte tx) . This 133 satoshis/byte fee rate is thus quite high, right? 3.3x higher than the upper range. It's enough to crowd out most legitimate transactions.

Alas, I've spoken personally with at least one 'elite' in Mumbai and another 'elite' in Delhi, and even they were conservative and risk-averse.

Hey, don't get me wrong. Privacy and anonymity are good, but what Bitcoin currently offers by default is the next best thing: pseudonymity. I was just trying to look at this from a practical point of view, and practically speaking I don't see much real benefit for more than pseudonymity.
Also, in terms of that paper and your claim that "Bitcoin enables everyone, including the guy next door to financially stalk you" -- how? If I hypothetically use vanilla Bitcoin and make a few transactions via Circle/Coinbase to purchase some stuff from Overstock, how is the guy next door going to track down those transactions and then associate them with my name/location? Even if I hypothetically use a self-hosted wallet like Breadwallet or Electrum, the guy next door is not going to be able to find those transactions in a block explorer, let alone associate them with me.
This is why Bitcoin is pseudonymous, and I argue that for most people, this pseudonymity is adequate. And if it's still not, then Darkwallet, Samourai Wallet, Circle/Coinbase, and future layer 2 tech (side chains, Lightning, Strawpay, payment channels, etc.) will provide all the anonymity/privacy one could desire.

I understand your sentiment here, Olivier. An "artificial limit", you're right, is probably a bad stop-gap fix. It's not setting a limit via market forces. This means, by definition, that it's probably sub-optimal. It seems it should be a dynamic limit, instead.
However, please keep in mind the latter half of my prior statement:




A dynamic system should raise/lower the limit, *without* ignoring externalization of costs to nodes &amp; miners. It should consider those externalized costs in its calculation, otherwise the system will centralize WRT nodes &amp; miners.
By considering these costs, we will retain the Bitcoin network's ability to be "purely peer to peer" (if someone wants to run a full node... and have full validation capability, transaction privacy, &amp; say in setting the rules for the system... then they should have that option).




Make sense?
Currently, dynamic limit proposals do not seem to account for the externalized (indirect / invisible-until-it's-too-late) costs.

Couldn't you argue that the reason silver exists in such a capacity is that gold is divisible only so much, and that the minimum amount is still too valuable for use in *all* typical transaction amounts?
Just to investigate this a bit further, I did a little research. A quick search shows that typically the smallest amount one can buy is "1 g", but if you search harder and are willing to pay a significant premium, you can find gold amounts as small as "1 grain".
1 gram gold bar = $38.75


1 grain gold bar = $2.51


But even the smallest unit, 1 grain, is worth $2.51 at spot price! This means one would not be able to even technically transact in gold with all purchases. So, this would logically mean another store of value is required, opening the path for silver.
I understand "silver is the poor man's gold" as the saying goes. Maybe this is true to some extent, since although smaller amounts of gold can be bought instead of buying a larger amount of silver, it's not easy to find such small amounts. If gold is regarded as so valuable, then I'm sure a poorer person would love to buy gold if possible, and avoid the silver. Since this has not been the case (which is why silver has value), perhaps the reason silver exists is its expense, along with the related point that gold can't be reliably used for purchases of less than ~$38 (1 g, since this seems to be the lowest commonly available/transactable unit, and is "much smaller than the smallest coin" from my previously mentioned source)?
Going back to Bitcoin, it has no such divisibility issue as gold does, so it would not seem to make sense that Litecoin would be required for any reason. Bitcoin can be purchased in any amount (equally accessible to rich and poor alike, similar to gold but not quite since $38 is a fair amount), and it can be used to transact in any amount (in clear contrast to gold, as gold only is viable for transactions of probably more than $38).

No one is actually trying to create a fee market, as the primary objective.
The idea, as has been reiterated multiple times in the last 1+ year, is to scale according to *technical constraints of maintaining at least current levels of decentralization*, without which Bitcoin's network would lose its unique, differentiating properties as a censorship-resistant payment system (vs. centralized systems like Visa, Paypal, etc.).
In that regard, SegWit is *already* planned for deployment within 3 months, and equals 70-80% increase in capacity. And yes, wallets are already working on updating to be ready by the time it arrives.
Further, 2MB HF (or something similar -- details not yet worked out) is being worked on for the medium-term future (15 months), to follow SegWit and again increase capacity, this time by about 100%.
So, there is nothing nefarious going on, and in fact scaling *is* already part of the plan.

In other words, postpone a bigger block hard fork (save it as an emergency patch -- if not including this patch early leads to a more jarring emergency hard fork later, we will at least know then that the bigger block advocates were right and consider it a lesson learned for the future), and instead implement the malleability-fixing soft fork (allowing scalability to still be tackled, but in a different way).
Can there be supermajority consensus for such a compromise?
Really, compromise should be the name of the game if/when argument has run its course; but I think there is much left in the debate, see:

Thanks for your detailed responses. As parent implied, I don't have any illusions about what you are saying. The situation with 21 perhaps is similar to Google, with both relying on an open network (Bitcoin and Internet) for their business. At the same time, I'm not convinced that Google is under the thumb of the government and a 100% compliant slave, or leaving that aside, at least I'm not convinced they act only in self-interest regarding the open Internet without regard for negative consequences on the Internet.
21 is (or appears to be, from what we know) fundamentally a Bitcoin mining company. If they fuck with (for lack of a better word) the Bitcoin network in any form, directly or indirectly, then, as I mentioned in my previous post, it will inevitable cause bad PR. This bad PR has the potential for all sorts of consequences, from severely harming trust in Bitcoin and thus the exchange rate and adoption (killing their business), to losing deals with other companies to embed their chip (also severely harming their business, since it could quickly become a domino effect of losing partners). The point is that the Bitcoin network represents a commons that anyone can access, and 21 is simply one participant in that network. I believe we can trust that they realize this, and that they will do their best to be a good actor within that network. Their health is tied to the health/vitality of the network, so it's in their interest to do so -- the incentives are aligned.
Google does not gain anything by hijacking the internet protocol (TCP-IP or whatever); they just use that network for their business and in fact do what they can to protect the integrity of that network (trying to expand internet access with Google Fiber, Project Loon, Android, Google Chrome, etc.).
I don't think it's too absurd to trust 21 will follow a similar path (keeping a good balance of self-/selfless- interest, and promoting ways to enhance the health of the network).

Aren't you inflating the fee? It's no longer 10,000 satoshis, but rather a range of 1,000-10,000 satoshis ($0.0025-0.025). 1,000-2,000 satoshis has worked fine in breadwallet for transactions. And, this is for on-chain transactions.
However, I am quite circumspect that on-chain will be the modus operandi for 21's transactions. There would presumably be a level 2 solution (21 mentions "software protocols"?), whether that's a side chain, Blockstream's sidechains, Strawpay, Lightning, hub and spoke payment channels, or something else. Maybe, even completely off-chain like ChangeTip.
In those above semi off-chain or off-chain routes, suddenly the minimum transaction size and the fee both disappear.


I don't have much of an argument to make against this, except to say that 21's Medium post was quite confident in claiming that their electrical engineers had developed a viable chip and full technology stack.

Haven't you seen enough discussion that this 20MB increase is far too drastic (and not a solution to scalability besides, but only a bandaid) in its impact on hurting network decentralization (50,000 nodes has fallen to ~5,000 nodes in the last few years)? So, having this single-sided conversation with Gavin about "can't we go forward with 20 MB" is extremely tone deaf and sidelines the legit concerns of the other side's view.

I'm skeptical how beautiful it is to allow the community of experts (core devs, core contributors, technical experts) to splinter and fragment into two different forks. That seems more like unproductive chaos than beauty. Anyone else with an opinion does not know enough to hold an *informed* opinion; we can't slip into a democracy of 'mob rule'. This debate needs to occur in a mature and scientific way that prizes process, facts, and pursuit of truth, far above mere opinions and speculation.
Yes, there are members of the community who cannot be reasoned with, who are 'extremists' for lack of a better word or simply 'trolls'. But, I'm confident they represent a tiny minority, and that real consensus can be achieved without any need for a harmful and disruptive fork in two directions.

A comment being removed means nothing (since it can happen automatically if flagged by Reddit or by a subreddit's rules). Whether it is then reinstated is what matters. And, your comment was reinstated.


I will repeat again, in case you missed it:

Further, r/btc promotes services (bitcoin.com, and other services that Roger invested in) that Roger profits from.
I will also add that anyone who observes the pattern of r/btc can see clearly that it is mob-rule sub with paranoia, conspiracy, propaganda, hate, altcoin-promotion, etc.
Combining the financial conflict of interest of r/btc mods with the nature of its users (a subset of whom may very well be paid sockpuppet accounts) leads that subreddit to be absolutely unsuitable to link to, especially when the primary purpose of that subreddit is to try to get r/bitcoin shut down (and hard-fork bitcoin).

SegWit achieves potential, on a case by case basis. It does not need full adoption by wallets to achieve the capacity increase. As soon as a wallet updates, due to the nature of SegWit, its users will have: 1) lower fees (estimate of 50% lower), 2) priority confirmation in a block. Thus, there is great incentive to update.

Okay, but know that mods are always happy to improve. And, I personally agree that things went too far, but that was in the past (1.5 years ago).
I guess I should add more context...
Back then, it was not mods unilaterally by magic becoming extremely strict, but rather it was a reaction to extreme drama fomented on r/bitcoin (by people like Mike Hearn and Gavin Andresen). Gavin &amp; Hearn's activities went on for 6+ months freely, after which, if I remember right, XT was announced to hard-fork Bitcoin with a contentious fork (that would split Bitcoin into 2 coins and ruin the system). This was a catalyst that crossed a red line, as it threatened a hostile takeover of Bitcoin (and splitting the coin in half). There was obviously a reaction to that by mods; however, I still do agree it exceeded certain reasonable limits.
However, after that brief overreaction, moderation strictness was quickly downgraded to a more steady-state level, and improvements have constantly been made over the last 1.5 years.

Where are you getting these absurd calculations from? You say a "few thousand early adopters" -- let's say, 3,000 exist -- on average, if these 3,000 have 2,000 btc each (equal to 6,000,000 btc), then each early adopter would have wealth equal to 2,000*1,000,000 = 2 billion USD. Last I saw, "all the oil companies" would take far more than 2 billion USD to buy.
Further, I personally think someone with the foresight and optimism and knowledge and patience to decide to buy bitcoin, when it was so worthless that it was possible to buy 10,000 btc, deserves that 2 billion USD windfall. Millionaires and billionaires are minted every day in the stock market, as employees with stock options in hot companies have their IPO. If bitcoin becomes worth 1 million USD per btc, it means it is valuable for the world. So, the early adopters (akin to those early employees) certainly deserve their wealth, especially also because they held (during the risky growing period) rather than selling for a quick buck early on when temptation was high.

Hi Erik,
I just want to make sure you (and everyone else) are crystal clear that r/bitcoin is not equal to Bitcoin Core. So, please don't get influenced in your mind about technical benefits, by the actions of people on r/bitcoin. To repeat, r/bitcoin IS NOT Bitcoin Core. So, mods' actions here are completely non-representative of how developers of Bitcoin Core feel. As usual, some may agree but others will disagree. There are lots of shades of grey. Some stuff in moderation is good, some is bad. There's no single generalization to be made here.
And, even within Core, there are lots of different opinions, although most of those opinions congeal in the same general direction.


Significant minority, or significant majority? Based on what I've seen so far, it looks like a significant minority. But, this is petty talk.
More importantly, what is the difference between Classic's roadmap and Core's roadmap?
* Core says 1.75-2x increase in 2016 (via segwit soft-fork) and followed by re-evaluation of hard-fork block size increase + other methods (such as soft-fork extension blocks) in late 2016-2017 (as scalability tech like IBLT/weak-blocks is developed in 2016).
* Classic says 2x increase in 2016 (via 2MB block size hard fork), and another 2x increase in 2018 (via 4MB block size hard fork). And, they say they'll "follow Satoshi's vision" (I love Satoshi as much as the next guy, but IMO this is a very "cult-ish", unnecessary, &amp; inappropriate statement to be making seriously, for what is a rigorous, scientific project like Bitcoin. The way things work is based on reality and evidence, not based on "prophetic" words from Satoshi 5 years ago.).
Do you see anything really that different (scaling-wise) in the two proposals? Because I don't.
So, why are you saying a "very significant number of people involved in this project believe to be superior" (and again, how do you define "very significant" -- since I see a significant minority, which is a minority nonetheless). This also begs the question of what is the purpose of Classic. The only thing that comes to mind is an attempted governance coup (yet again), just like in XT. Coinbase wants much greater control over what happens (not surprising, what private company doesn't?). And, lots of misinformation/paranoia/conspiracy-theories over time seem to have managed to convince certain mining entities that Core doesn't care about their views, even though Core's roadmap basically panders to miners (although it's coincidental, since Core follows principle of technical/security prudence) by giving them an increase within the "2x in 2016" limit they desire.
As it turns out, XT's basis of BIP101 (8MB in 2016, 16MB in 2018, etc.) is completely far removed from Classic's basis (2MB in 2016, 4MB in 2018). So, what legitimacy does one continue to give people like Gavin (is he who you define as "significant"?), when they spent 2015 pushing an extremely contentious BIP101/XT hard-fork on the Bitcoin community (and constantly freaking out about its urgency -- crying wolf?)... and now suddenly are fine with 2MB in 2016? By the way, Gavin is the same person who mocked Adam Back's 2-4-8 plan by saying "average website downloads more than 2MB". Again, is Gavin the person you refer to as "significant", and if so, how do you justify this, given what I've described? This might be controversial to say, but I think it's a very important point, since we should be giving *more* credit to those who speak rationally, and *less* weight to those who speak without sense (if we are indeed a meritocratic system? and want to improve as time goes on?).
BTW, I agree it's inflammatory and unnecessary to call it an "altcoin", and rather that it's a contentious hard fork proposal (although obviously not contentious in the sense that Core basically is okay with the same levels of increase -- but contentious in the sense that Core believes superior option is to get segwit's other benefits ALONG WITH the 1.75-2x increase &amp; accomplish it via a safer soft-fork, rather than a hard-fork).

Yes, mining is quite centralized from one point of view (BTW, the other point of view is "hundreds of thousands of hashers own the hardware that constitutes at least 2/3 of the hashrate, so it's not as simple as there only existing a limited number of pools"), but do we want to do something to turn that situation around? Or, do we want our response to be: "Oh well, mining is centralized, so let's forget about prudence in decision making"?
Winklevii are arguing that the situation of nodes + miners will get more centralized, if the situation is allowed to fester (e.g. through imprudent scaling decisions). Instead, they support conservative changes that fight to maintain/increase decentralization (since without a decentralized network, they think Bitcoin loses differentiating characteristics from Paypal/Visa). Being conservative about increasing the limit helps the decentralization situation, while being aggressive harms it.

Market forces are the only natural and self-sustaining way to "build energy now with renewables" -- and we are rapidly reaching that point with the prices of solar and lithium-ion batteries dropping rapidly over time and now reaching parity with fossil fuels.
If you want some hope for the future, energy-wise, I highly recommend reserving 18 minutes to watch this:
But yeah, I guess I'm confused why you're raising this issue as if it was a new one, and as if it's not in fact being solved as we speak.

I posted this not because it's Peter Todd, which is irrelevant, but to generate discussion on the message within that seems important and undiscussed. Peter Todd's tweet cites a comment by (Greg Maxwell), the relevant part of which is:


As an aside, I'm tired of seeing an academic discussion degenerate in various instances into subtle and not-so-subtle personal attacks. Everyone here (except altcoin shills and buttcoiners -- thanks Gavin for mentioning this possibility in another comment) has a common objective: see Bitcoin succeed. Some want only on-chain method of success (hence fewer, high-value transactions), while others see mass adoption as the only way Bitcoin will truly grow and become useful which requires mostly-off-chain approach (trustless ideally like Lightning, but until then, auditable-trusted as a crutch like Amiko Pay or Strawpay).
Re: Consensus + 'Forking' with XT
* If we assume the community is not monolithic (and it isn't), then we want to generate precedent to act in a way that generates maximum consensus. Forking can **not** be an option; how is forking *better* than dealing with a scalability crisis when it emerges? So, the XT idea seems 'undesirable' to put it lightly. One simple way to generate consensus on an ambiguous issue with opposing priorities like this one is to simply wait until there is a true clear problem to solve. So, rather than now, maybe wait 6 months and if transaction counts continue to climb upward and start causing issues, then an emergency patch (which can be made ready now, in advance) can be implemented "within days" if need be, with full consensus.
To move forward and achieve consensus, it's clear we need real, peer-reviewed research on the blocksize increase debate, with a scientific/organized/objective approach to establish the facts. Of course, this research-gathering process needs to prioritize and be time-limited, so that it does not stretch on for months or years:
* Historical/Current/Projected increases in demand (in terms of TPS) on the Bitcoin network, and how the current situation deals with it and scales.
* For future scaling, which size &amp; why.
* Static increase, percent increase, or algorithmic increase in size, and why.
* Projected impact on nodes (+ other decentralization metrics).
* If/how much # of nodes actually matters, in keeping Bitcoin decentralized.
* A true delving into and understanding of Satoshi's view and its rationale (objective merits/demerits of the view), as he is the architect of Bitcoin and deserves extra recognition for that. i.e. Supposedly, he expected the network evolve into few, high-powered nodes and was fine with that.
* The exact 'emergency patch' to increase blocksize in case of 'emergency', the exact triggers that will enable the patch (as decided by objective measures), and the timetable in which it would be expected to be implemented.
* A real scalability roadmap to address the core issue here of scalability (Lightning, Strawpay, Amiko Pay, Sidechains... and/or simply ad infinitum increase in blocksize?) that is backed by thoughtful, peer-reviewed research. We need a real, transparent plan of development (not just 1 person being assigned to Lightning -- how is it supposed to be completed in any reasonable amount of time?). There should be consolidation of resources, where helpful, among the different approaches. Right now, it seems we have independent, disjointed teams (Straw, Amiko, Lightning), some with funding and some without funding, all with varying ETA's (Straw -- reportedly "a few months", Amiko -- "few years with current state of no funding", Lightning -- unknown, Sidechains -- unknown).
* etc. etc.

When? Also, even if it happened, mistakes are made in life. No one is perfect, or will ever be perfect. What matters instead is the trend of behaviors.


I don't think this is appropriate. Erik Voorhees has been more rational than most, second perhaps only to Trace Mayer. Take a look at his companions though: Olivier + Roger. Everything is relative, so be careful before you put too high standards on others. I definitely don't think he deserves that kind of biting remark at all...
More specifically, the message you responded to was not that bad? Erik seems confused why 2MB HF + SegWit cannot deal with the next 2 years. The answer is that it very well could, but isn't on the roadmap *currently* pending creation of the HF proposal and reaching of consensus among Core devs.

SegWit is step  it's a short-term scaling method (3 months). It is about 70-80% increase in capacity.
2MB HF is step  it's a possible (details still need to be worked out) medium-term scaling method (15 months). It is about 100% increase in capacity.

You you just ignored all the arguments that refuted most of what you said, and instead flipped a rock to find something else. Good manners would be to acknowledge you were wrong, before bringing up something different.
In terms of links to the other subreddit:
* r/bitcoin is under daily attack from sockpuppets and sybils (many of whom come from r/btc and happy spread propaganda there in an unfettered fashion, since the mods there are paid to help promote Roger's agenda), and so mods must take certain extra precautions and measures to keep the subreddit useable and useful by its primary community. In such a situation, it is inevitable that there will be mistakes made, but it is not equivalent to 'censorship'. 
* r/bitcoin has moderators, and none of these moderators are paid, or have conflicts of interests. The subreddit also does not unduly promote any services that the mods would profit from. r/btc (Roger Ver's subreddit) has moderators who are paid (and paid by Roger Ver). Further, r/btc promotes services (bitcoin.com, and other services that Roger invested in) that Roger profits from.

Oh crap, okay, so I said:


What I meant to say is: "A generally agreed upon safe time-frame in which to conduct a hard-fork is 12 months". And, I base that off conservative-minded / safety-minded devs, like Pieter Wuille, desiring at least 12 months. This is public knowledge, as far as his desires.
Sorry my original sentence came out wrong.
The HK agreement was for July 2017, but obviously not the consensus of Core devs, in general. That part, as I said in a different way elsewhere in the post, is premature for now. It will be discussed and consensus sought during May-July 2016, so I'd think it wise to wait until later when work is done on it.

Core has proposed a 1.75x SegWit SF, while Classic has proposed a 2x 2MB HF. The increase in capacity is similar enough and, furthermore, a SF can be implemented safely more quickly than a HF can be safely implemented. Do you know that SegWit SF will be ready by April 2016, and then can be deployed by miners after that? All it needs is wallets to update, of which many wallets are in the process of doing so as we speak (so they can be ready once SegWit SF is active on the network):


In other words, Core's plan = superior version of Classic's plan.

Just to clarify, re: this point:


There's no reason Bitcoin cannot be a truly better PayPal (PayPal 2.0), but for it to be better, it must also be decentralized. How do we achieve extremely high scaling throughput, while also keeping the system decentralized? Combine conservative block-size increases (e.g. segwit) and/or block-size efficiency improvements (e.g. schnorr) -- to minimize storage/bandwidth burden on user's full node -- with layer-2 networks (e.g. Lightning).

Microsoft and Google (and Apple) are companies with market caps in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Coinbase is worth 100s of times less, so it has much less power/clout against government.
Further, what is wrong with this?


1. Complying with regulations is essential to raise capital from investors, and just to stay in business. And raising that capital and staying in business is what will allow Coinbase to get more users and hence increase Bitcoin adoption.
2. So what if Bitcoin loses "some of its use cases" that are frankly ILLEGAL? Say what you will about the drug war, etc. and if drugs should or should not be illegal, but we live in a society of laws. Society can't function without those laws in place to provide some semblance of order. It's not perfect, but it is what it is, and it's a hell of a lot more functional than 3rd world nations without good law and order. So, if Bitcoin loses its 'other' use cases, so what? The consequence is it will join the mainstream, as hundreds of millions of users join the system and 'legal' transactions become the norm. As it is, the money is with 'legal' transactions, since 'illegal' transactions make up a tiny sliver of the market. The system and the world will benefit by moving to Bitcoin far more than the benefits currently existing to allow users to purchase illegal goods (not to mention that functionality will never disappear anyway -- you don't need Coinbase to use bitcoin).
In summary, I'm failing to see any problem here.

Another perspective is here:


The LN fees reported in the design are estimated to be minimal (fractions of a single cent). An entity locks BTC capital in a LN node.

Sorry, but I don't think people like you understand how business works. You don't decide which rules to follow and which rules to ignore.

This is misleading. The block size situation is not simply about what percent of blocks are full. It's primarily about what fee rate is currently in play.
You could have full blocks, yet have an insignificant fee rate. This means most regular user transactions would bypass the tiny-fee rate transactions, and no issue would occur in practice.
Or, as right now, you could have an entity spamming the network with high-fee rate transactions, more likely than not in an attempt to crowd out others' transactions. But, alas, I haven't done enough research to conclusively believe that narrative.

That's fine, in theory, but in practice, non-developer types are highly loath to use IRC (while the reverse is less true, since barrier to entry is generally lower for the less technical Slack). Slack is already used by business types, thus creating a Slack is the practical choice if the goal is to enhance communication efforts between devs and non-devs. The current incarnation of Bitcoin Core Slack is open to all Bitcoin Core contributors. A good number of them have joined, and regularly have productive interactions with the rest of the community. But, you're right; a good number of devs also continue to stubbornly cling to IRC, instead of recognizing Slack for what it is (tool to increase communication with non-dev world) and therefore making the best use of it.


Of course, as expected. Slack doesn't take over dev activities; it's meant to enhance communication between devs and non-devs.

Total strawman imaginary argument, since no one is saying segwit is "long term scaling". Segwit will double tx capacity (by latest estimate actually 2.1x), which makes a short-term bump hard-fork irrelevant since segwit can activate much more safely as a soft-fork vs. hard-fork version of block-size increase.
So yes, it's a malleability fix *and* it's absolutely a short-term capacity-doubling block-size increase, done with relatively lower risk as a soft-fork (no chain-split risk as from hard-fork).
This is the logical choice for now, as we measure and collect data on impact on system, test LN on mainnet, and plan for additional scaling improvements.

I'll do my best to answer.


I'm going to assume that when you say "legacy SW", this is equivalent to "legacy software".
Full nodes should always upgrade on a timely schedule to be up-to-date with security fixes, as well as optimized Core software. Those that don't upgrade will revert to SPV security, where they do not validate SegWit transactions but do independently validate non-SegWit transactions.


Right, they will not independently validate SegWit transactions. But, there is no fork. They still accept those transactions and pass them along.


It's a soft-fork because it's opt-in (optional). If it was a hard-fork (mandatory), then your above scenario (a fork) would occur. There would be two incompatible chains.


It's a good thing because it does not break old software. It's backwards compatible. Old software continues to operate as normal, if not updated (it will simply not validate the SegWit transactions, but it will still accept them and relay them).

It's not on the roadmap, because overall Core doesn't have consensus on it. This is natural, since it has not yet been created. The creation process and coming to consensus process is due to occur between May-July, after SegWit (step  is completed.


Well, based on public comments, various Core devs support it (and participated in the agreement), while others were not part of the agreement and thus naturally cannot be in a position to support it (or to not support it).


How do you know? I've done a lot of analysis, and I think we're perhaps cutting things close in a way... but if SegWit arrives on time, and it's closely followed by trust-minimized Lightning (which will get refined in the following months after release, and more widespread) + 21's own micropayment solution + semi-trusted versions like Thunder Network, etc. (these layer 2 solutions should help soak away some tx demand from layer 1, and thus increase capacity indirectly)... then, by the time mid-2017 rolls around, we'll be due for another capacity increase that will expand supply again (and we won't be crushed by increasing demand, due to aforementioned layer 1 + layer 2 puzzle pieces).


The safe way to do it, unanimously agreed to by parties signatory to HK Consensus Letter, is for July 2017 as HF date. However, during the proposal-/consensus- crafting process between May-July 2016, it's possible a variant capacity increase technique is crafted that is superior in various ways (such as timeframe in which it can be safely rolled out). So, let's wait until July 2016, before worrying more about the future HF?

Disagree, and here's why.
It's not like Core says to activate segwit, and that then it's the end solution. Segwit brings a short-term 2x bump, as well as lays the foundation for future scale (layer-2 like LN, layer-1 like Schnorr, MAST, and other efficiency technologies).
It also does not preclude a future safely-designed hard-fork, e.g. Pieter Wuille (Core dev) previously released a BIP for a 17.7% annual increase in block size, which corresponds with his analysis of global tech rate of increase.
Core devs have also discussed and begun research into more definitive scaling ideas, such as flex-cap and dynamic block size based on validation-cost metrics.

A conflict of interest requires Blockstream to profit from LN scaling.
Blockstream is only funding a single employee to work on LN. Furthermore, LN does not lead to profit for Blockstream. LN is a trust-minimized, decentralized system of LN nodes. Anyone can run a LN node, and the amount of BTC one locks up with their LN node determines how much fees one may earn.
Hence, this accusation of conflict-of-interest with respect to LN does not make sense.

I don't know why you guys make this same argument repeatedly, since it has been corrected numerous times. Core and BU are not compatible clients (they have different consensus rules).

They have had it explained to them innumerable times how "different vision" is illogical and hurts decentralization. The vision of scaling based on layers is what will scale, while simultaneously helping to preserve decentralization (by minimizing full node's storage/bandwidth usage on layer-1, i.e. on-chain). If someone refuses to admit this simple concept's validity, and keeps pushing their "vision" of mainly on-chain scaling (while also acknowledging "sure full nodes may transition from being run by normal users to being run in data centers"), then what is there to conclude? Ignorance, malice, greed, hunger for power? You tell me.
@_date: 2015-05-24 20:45:09
Why as an advanced setting? Advanced settings are barely touched by most end users. Breadwallet has successfully been auto-adjusting fees (hidden, in the background) between 10-100 bits according to transaction, for the last few months. Why pay 100 bits (2.5 cents) per transaction, when it's viable right now to pay much less (as low as 0.25 cents).
By the way, this is also an important point because the smaller the fee, the smaller the payment that can be sent. If the fee is kept at default of 2.5 cents, then it limits transactions to greater than 2.5 cents. A fee of 0.25 cents means a much wider range of micropayments is possible right away, without having to wait for future developments (sidechains, lightning, et. al).

The idealism is good and all, but it's easy for people without that idealism to manipulate those with it towards their ends (what is known as "useful idiots"). Who knows, maybe Roger is good at heart and is being manipulated as a useful idiot, since we know how seemingly idealistic he is.
The current situation, IMO, is as follows.
It's not like Core says to activate segwit, and that then it's the end solution. Segwit brings a short-term 2x bump, as well as lays the foundation for future scale (layer-2 like LN, layer-1 like Schnorr, MAST, and other efficiency technologies).

Core devs have also discussed and begun research into more definitive scaling ideas, such as flex-cap and dynamic block size based on validation-cost metrics.
If you grant me this analysis as accurate, then Core is in fact laser-focused on both security &amp; scaling; in fact, they want scaling, but that it be done safely, so as not to risk the underlying foundation of Bitcoin by being reckless. If this is in fact the case, then it's a no-brainer to evaluate Core as superior to BU, and not spend your effort supporting BU's misguided (at best) efforts. In other words, there is no rational reason to construct a false equivalency between Core &amp; BU.

SegWit is step  it's a short-term scaling method (3 months). It is about 70-80% increase in capacity.
2MB HF is step  it's a possible (details still need to be worked out) medium-term scaling method (15 months). It is about 100% increase in capacity.
Very simple! Hope this helps clear it up.
@_date: 2016-01-27 05:15:09
Core has proposed a 1.75x SegWit SF, while Classic has proposed a 2x 2MB HF. The increase in capacity is similar enough and, furthermore, a SF can be implemented safely more quickly than a HF can be safely implemented. Do you know that SegWit SF will be ready by April 2016, and then can be deployed by miners after that? All it needs is wallets to update, of which many wallets are in the process of doing so as we speak (so they can be ready once SegWit SF is active on the network):


In other words, Core's plan = superior version of Classic's plan.

It's a free market with dynamic pricing, as opposed to a price-fixed system that externalizes costs to those who run full nodes and smaller miners.
If you believe in free markets, then you will support a dynamic system that uses money to balance supply and demand, and does not offload costs in an externalized fashion that centralizes the network.

u/brg444 might be abrasive at times towards the other side (which they then classify as "troll-ish"), but he is at least filled to the brim with actual knowledge about Bitcoin &amp; hence mostly argues with substance. I mean, I've learned a lot from his comments and tweets. He's truly devoted to "educating", as his primary motive, I think.
I mean, it's hard to put into words what is bad about "Peter R", but have some debates with him and you'll get an idea (well you can't do this anymore, but yeah). I've "debated" him and watched him operate for at least the last 1 year. It's frankly impossible to debate him, because he will insist on constructing "evidence" in a way that suits his agenda. And, he has a singular agenda, and will do everything he can to promote/achieve it almost in a pathological sense (utterly disregard anything contradictory). He is extremely "manipulative" and is a pro at propaganda; this may be the best way I can put it?
Basically, almost every single possible argument this dude makes is bullshit, or, a politer term being "disingenuous". His pie charts are bullshit; his terminology is bullshit (use of the term "Blockstream Core", referral to r/bitcoin as "North Korea", speaking about "decentralizing development" in relation to his pie charts); his rationale of insults against gmaxwell is bullshit; his insults in general against Core &amp; Core devs is bullshit ("Core devs are just specialized programmers; they lack rounded knowledge of different academic areas that is needed to make proper decisions", "e.g. Core lacks economics knowledge .. which, hint-hint, of course only I and my gang have!" -- and don't mention u/psztorc to him or the other numerous examples of people who also have knowledge of economics and can &amp; do advise Core on it... because as mentioned, he will simply ignore the point, redirect, or deflect).

Understand that there are downsides and tradeoffs to these things. This isn't a situation where "let's just get it over with" is remotely considered a wise option? This is not about "act first, think later". That kind of decision-making is absolutely unacceptable.
If Pieter Wuille and many of the other Core devs believe SegWit soft-fork is the wisest short-term 1.75-2x capacity increase option for mid-2016 (partly because it increases capacity in soft-fork fashion which is safer + partly because of the host of other benefits it includes besides a mere capacity increase), then that is the wisest option.
Here's also a separate post by Pieter, which outlines his views:
* 
Either way, miners will only accept max 2x increase in 2016. Are you aware of that? This is a binary choice: either deploy soft-fork virtual block-size increase via SegWit, or deploy a hard-fork block-size increase.
*More detailed overview of SegWit*:
* 175% to 400% direct capacity upgrade (1.75-4x capacity increase, depending on factors like multisig use)
* 66% additional improvement in bi-directional channel efficiency by consolidating channel open/close operations
* an end to third-party malleability that hurts smart contract deployment (and resolves an attack vector -- remember the malleability attacks we suffered in 2015?)
* fraud proofs to allow lightweight clients to better participate in economic enforcement (allows creation of "super SPV" clients, thereby reducing the number of full nodes needed to secure Bitcoin -- which provides more flexibility on that front, and so is good when considering tradeoffs of future scaling ... this is a more medium-term option, as it won't be immediately available; SegWit lays the groundwork to allow fraud proofs to be possible)
* ability to more easily upgrade Bitcoin’s Script language so that new and more powerful trustless contracts may be devised (powerful upgrades, like Confidential Transactions, can be done quicker as an opt-in soft-fork, instead of as an opt-out and hence more contentious and consequently more time-consuming hard-fork)
This can then be followed up later in 2016/2017 (as appropriate, based on the progress of scalability tech, like: IBLT, weak blocks, blocktorrent, etc.) with a hard fork for block size increase (flex cap? static increase? 2-4-8 rescaled to respect SegWit's increase? BIP202? something else?)... or, perhaps a hard fork will never be needed and a soft 'firm' fork can suffice (bip102 as soft fork; extension block concept).
Any questions or concerns with what I've laid out?

u/evoorhees, did you see the recent Bitcoin Roundtable Consensus? I think it set July 2016, as the date when the details of the HF would be revealed. This is because devs are currently busy with lots of other work (SegWit, CSV, etc.), in prep to meet the April 2016 ETA for SegWit. After that, 3 months (through July 2016) is allotted to figure out the details of a responsible HF.
As for the scaling issue, have you taken a look at transaction statistics?

This may be another casualty of politics in the Bitcoin space (is a partner at a16z VC firm, which is a major investor in Coinbase, which is advised by Gavin). This is the same Gavin, who admits he sees Bitcoin as leaving its decentralized roots by becoming centralized &amp; is nonchalant about it. On the other hand, Core devs *are* interested in preserving it, hence scaling in a careful non-reckless manner. This is also the same Gavin who has created all manner of cry-wolf emergency &amp; discord within Bitcoin development circles, as well as in the larger community, for the last 1.5 years with: 2 hostile forks, character assassination of Core devs in public forums and privately with industry and miners, as well as a populist political campaign predicated on assumption of ignorance among his followers.

FUD.. Bitcoin txs are ordered in priority according to fee/size. Lack of a full block means incentive for spamming of the block chain with txs of a non-monetary purpose, which has an externalized cost (network decentralization).


... except, most services require minimum 1 confirmation. So confirmation *is* required. Also, even in principle, the point of Bitcoin is to have a verified/confirmed transaction; lack of confirmations means a tx is not trustworthy.
Why doesn't breadwallet give their users some control over fee/size paid to self-determine their tx's priority? e.g. High priority vs. Regular priority. In the end, fee/size is everything, as miners use this property to determine the priority of a tx.

For a typical 225-byte transaction, 60 satoshis/byte = 60 * 225 / 10000 * 6.38 = 8.6 cents. This is to have a confirmation within an estimated 1 block (average 10 min), which is priority speed. If you are fine waiting longer, then pick a lower fee.

"1.6 to 2MB" -- and after LN, perhaps more than 2MB.


Also, SegWit enables 2 more improvements to be made (Schnorr + MAST), which optimize transactions to reduce size + increase privacy (related to CoinJoin). This would add further increase in capacity (not sure exact amount).


@_date: 2016-06-22 20:16:39
You paid about 40 satoshis/byte (0.0001 * 100 / 255) in fees. Speed of transaction is influenced by how much fee is attached. A higher priority fee would be 2x or 3x higher than what you used.

Yes, I noticed. It seems he has fallen prey to their marketing department. "17s block times" is flashy marketing. In reality, a recent study showed that, at most, Bitcoin confirmations are 6x slower (not (misunderstood interpretation of their marketing's claim of 40x slower). With SegWit's deployment over the next couple months, the gap will fall to about 6 / 1.75 = 3.5x slower (because more txs will be able to pass with every block). With Schnorr and MAST over the next 6 months or so, the gap will reduce again (not sure by how much, but approximately 50% if I guess conservatively to 3.5 / 1.5 = 2.3x).
Also, do not forget that Bitcoin will achieve this scale *with* its 7-years of battle-tested security firmly in place, and without the centralized mockery currently in place that is freezing funds on the block chain, and debating easier creation of blacklists in the future.
With Lightning, the "17 second block time" argument is further moot, since Lightning "confirms" transactions in ~1 second.


How do you define "long time"? As far as I know, Lightning's beta will be out in the next 1-2 months. Lightning has 2 pre-conditions to function optimally: CSV (activates in 9 days), SegWit (to fix malleability). Once these are out, Lightning can function in a fully performant manner.

If you're not trying to create drama (as you have done repeatedly now on several occasions, without claim, instead of privately messaging mods to figure out what is wrong), then why did you fail to read &amp; internalize the following statement from u/bashco's comment?


In other words, Reddit removed the submission (presumably because CoinTelegraph has been associated with 'spam' in Reddit.com 's eyes).
Next time, a more careful read would be in order, instead of launching into emotional, fact-free tirades about 'censorship this' and 'censorship that'.

Perception often becomes reality. In that sense, they can continue perpetuating BTC-Brexit link, as far as I care, since it only helps to strengthen the idea of BTC as "digital gold" &amp; "safe haven asset" which, in turn, increases the utility of BTC. Also, to be fair, BTC was conceived in this manner, as a safe haven asset that incentivizes creation of a self-contained financial system (outside current financial system). So, in some sense, the media is reporting accurately (even if the price rise was not necessarily associated).
One could also argue the price rise may be related; I've seen arguments that the downward move may have been halted by buying strength on the basis of Brexit reasons. We also have the anecdote from BitFury George that a multi-billion home office inquired to purchase 25,000 BTC following Brexit.

Yeah, I'm aware. Micro- / Nano- transactions are only feasible through payment channels, a trust-minimized form of which is the upcoming Lightning network. Further, Lightning will offer ~1 second "confirmation" time (which would also be very helpful for 21's purposes).
@_date: 2017-01-06 18:56:31
The article's argument is predicated on view of Coinbase's first employee. It is not Wired's opinion. Further, the view is that BTC is a digital gold (store of value), not a currency (medium of exchange). Currently, this is in fact mostly the case, as most BTC is bought and saved as an investment, and does not henceforth move (get transacted). As store of value function solidifies (as more confidence accrues), and as the tech improves to allow predictably instant and cheap transactions (via SegWit and layer-2 routing networks like Lightning), then BTC will become more suitable to function as a currency.

Simply from a security standpoint, it's horribly unwise to be running such an old version of an OS. Financial software like Bitcoin Core should really only be run on a secure system; security is improved by running the most recent OS version, since security updates are a key component of OS updates.

Viewing the argument this way has never really made much sense, in my opinion, though. SegWit is inherently a replacement for a hard-fork block size increase, as well as also being a fix for tx malleability (and offering other improvements and opportunities for future extension of BTC). One must acknowledge all the components that are part of SegWit. By doing this, it becomes very common-sense to support SegWit over the alternatives -- since we get more 'bang for the buck' per se.
@_date: 2019-08-31 04:31:09


You’re talking about the present. The future will require higher fees to compensate for the falling block reward. And you’re talking about 10 min (600 sec) average to confirm “relatively quickly”, which is relatively quick compared to what, I don’t know.
I’m talking about the alternative using zero fees now &amp; forever, and confirming in 0.2 sec (3,000x faster).


That’s an interesting way of putting it, except moving money in &amp; out of a checking account is free with ACH, so there is little friction to making sure it is topped up to make payments. With Lightning, you have to make new layer 1 payments to top up the channel, which requires fees and time.
Again, I’m talking about the alternative being instant (0.2 sec), or 3000x faster.
To summarize:
1. Big layer 1 fee (in future) + little layer 2 fees ... vs. zero fees (infinitely cheaper)
2. 10 min (600 sec) to fund Lightning wallet via layer 1 tx ... vs. 0.2 sec (3,000x faster)

I don’t know if Hal was Satoshi alone, or part of Satoshi, but his death (as well as how in the cited posts, he acts like there will be only effectively 20 million bitcoins vs. the 21 million total supply of Bitcoin), and the lack of movement of Satoshi’s bitcoins ever since, may suggest it.

What could/would be the alternative to a block explorer, which would provide the same useful function, but without the negatives?
@_date: 2019-08-24 02:07:46
Maybe adaptive block sizes could work, but then there would have to be some tail inflation added (remove the fixed supply cap), so that lack of sufficient fees doesn’t imperil security. However, going past 21 million bitcoins would most likely be politically untenable, as a fixed supply is one of Bitcoin’s most cherished features.
The other issue is it’s top-down central planning to decide what percent tail emission is necessary for security, with free market forces also disturbed by having adaptive block size that prevents a fee market from developing. In this situation, if it turns out the tail emission number is faulty for some reason, then the damage will have already been done.

This is my point. If you’re getting into prescribing what people should and shouldn’t care about, that’s a broken way of looking at it (arrogant &amp; unwise &amp; doomed to fail), since it clashes with reality and user demand. Accepting reality and designing around that is the correct process.
Obviously many/most people want the ability to view public addresses (hence why they’re public, why Bitcoin was designed as a public/open network where all activity can be seen in the open), for various reasons (not just about forensics, though forensic applications have useful reasons too — including verifying the supply and making sure an inflation bug isn’t being exploited).
Another useful function is using a block explorer to verify balances, including your own without needing to access your wallet (zero security risk to use explorer to view balance, so it creates less paranoia for the user).

If in a rush, it's a good idea to pay a high-priority fee. Around now, that would be a fee rate of about 100 satoshis/byte, or for a standard tx of 225 bytes, it would be 100 * 225 = 22500 satoshis (0.000225 bitcoins), or 22500 / 100 = 225 bits.


@_date: 2019-08-24 02:29:28
Just visualizing in my head the adaptive block size effect on fee market, it seems even if there is a big delay in rising block size that still causes higher fees, then the same would be true as the block size then falls (after demand spike dies) and thus causes lower fees. So these two sides of the demand fee spike event would be expected to cancel out. When it returns to equilibrium of block size vs. demand, then fees would be minimized. End effect? Minimized fees + higher fees + lower fees = overall minimized fees. I don’t know if there’s an actual visualization of what happens, but could this be true?
Passing on continuing the tail emission argument for now, since the core change being discussed is an adaptive block size.

I don’t know. But it’s clearly suspicious because price was not weak prior to falling. It was instead actually heading up. Someone trying to maximize the value they get for selling their bitcoins would gently sell as it’s moving higher, and be encouraged to let it keep going higher as it’s already moving up, not sell in one big amount, break the uptrend, and sell at a lower price of 9,700 vs. 10,200. So, it stands to reason this price fall was an example of manipulation.

(Not that there’s anything wrong with “HODL and get rich”, since HODL is what you do when you have a store of value asset. HODLing is just saving. A society of savers is far healthier than one of excessive consumption and debt. Saving also is necessary to then be able to invest, which improves society.)
But nice to see how Roger allowed BCH to corrupt his ideological positions, so that now everything is about money to him, rather than actually changing the world (he pays lip service to it still, but it’s clear he has been corrupted by his increase in wealth from BTC, as well as his takeover attempt via BCH).

Right, fees can be driven up, but that doesn’t mean anything changes with regard to getting consensus on bigger blocks, since that issue is complex. Fees are needed for anti-spam mechanism, and to pay miners as the block reward falls over time. Also, don’t forget this attack means that the attacker loses a lot of money in fees to sustain it. Also, now everyone understands the situation and has adapted in various ways after the prior attack, so any future attempt will be diluted and have far less impact.

This has nothing to do with the system itself. It has to do with life choices. Being frugal (spending much less than you earn) lets you avoid debt and accumulate savings, and the savings makes it simple to avoid even more debt (like debt from car purchase). Being happy or unhappy depends on your attitude to life, and how you live life. People who suffer from what you listed are that way because they lack a sense of personal responsibility, and do not take responsibility for their thoughts and actions. Once you start taking full responsibility for your life, instead of blaming others and waiting for someone (or government) to give you handouts and fix your life for you, then your life changes. It starts with you, no one else.
Part of the problem can also be related to people being spoiled, and then jealous/envious of others due to social media, so they are never happy no matter what they have. Very poor people in developing countries are often paradoxically much happier than richer people in developed countries.

Sorry, I probably should have included that source in my original post. It's also since been posted and has its own thread and discussion (although a lot of the discussion is sadly a waste of space, and does not discuss the merits of Adam's actual proposition... which I think represents significant compromise from previous positions -- maybe if Gavin's side and Adam's side can compromise to 4MB, from 2MB and 8MB, then we can finally have a compromise solution): 


As for the rest of your post, I can't confirm or deny any of it, right? So, it's your word vs. his word, and I'm too tired to figure out the truth. It makes me weary to read these kinds of 'he said, she said' "bickering" style of posts. What I do know is this:
1. I have you 'friended' on Reddit (so that your posts are highlighted 'red'), which means at some point I decided you were an intelligent r/bitcoin-er and it was worth it to have your posts highlighted. I've friended many others too, but that just means I've found a lot of people who, for various reasons, can be defined as 'intelligent' / 'thoughtful'.
2. u/nullc is also 'friended' by me, obviously. I have major, major respect for him, which is going to take a lot to be overshadowed by mistakes he commits (e.g. see this post and its parent:  He is a really super technical expert and Bitcoin's most prolific privacy advocate / privacy developer (actually putting theory into practice) -- examples: CoinJoin, Confidential Transactions, etc. Now, as is often the case with 'geniuses' (I think we can perhaps classify u/nullc in this category, at this point), social skills can be lacking, but that's okay! With strengths in one area, it's natural to have weaknesses in other areas. As you referred to in a later post directed at u/nullc, I did offer advice to him (and simultaneously to myself), but I also said in a different post in that same thread (in a reply to the other guy) that u/nullc *did* explicitly recognize his mistake and apologize. I also explained u/nullc had reasons for jumping to the conclusion he did. So, to make clear, I'm not saying u/nullc does not have social skills. Rather, what I've seen of him (and my interactions, directly and anonymously) indicate he does have an abundance of manners. But, even if we say he does not, it does not detract from the respect one has for his technical genius. At least, this is my philosophy on the matter.
Anyway, this is getting long... my point is just that we all need to learn to contextualize each other's mistakes in the big picture of their accomplishments and the individual situation (have empathy), while also remembering no person is perfect. Instead of being defensive, if one makes a mistake, just correct it quickly and move on. Forget about letting ego intrude. In the current situation, I can't judge which one of you is at fault, due to my limited reading, but it's not constructive to argue -- just fix what needs fixing, and move on.
P.S. Except for not replying to nullc's post (and not correcting the table based on his new info), I certainly noticed you carefully replied to everyone else's post (and corrected the table based on their points) and I commend you for that :).
P.S.S. For the record, I disagree with theymos's 'censorship' of XT posts in r/bitcoin (it, at least initially, seems to have done a lot of damage to Core and enhanced the image of XT -- it's a miracle that the Streisand Effect did not kick in more strongly and push people to support XT regardless of merit! for a while, I was horrified at the possibility of it happening), but he 'founded/owns' the subreddit and has the right to do what he wants with it. At the same time, I can understand a little why he might be censoring XT (although I think it's being relaxed a bit now). It was misguided in hindsight, but I believe he was trying to restore a certain degree of order and tranquility to the subreddit. No matter though, lots of the top voices of r/bitcoin have made their unhappiness clearly known in thoughtful posts in that sticky thread, so hopefully this was a mistake that u/theymos can quietly learn from for the future.
@_date: 2015-08-25 23:42:21
This list is incorrect, in various aspects. u/nullc provided lots of corrections, which you did not acknowledge or use to update your post. Why not? You've seemingly ignored his post.
Further, the 'employer' of Gavin and Wladamir is specifically 'MIT Media Lab'. MIT is not responsible for directly paying their salaries; rather, the MIT Media Lab is funded by various corporate entities.




Finally, as an example, Adam Back can be cited saying he supports increasing to 2MB immediately, 4MB in 2 yrs, and 8MB in 4 yrs. Similar nuance exists with at least some of the other people mentioned in the list, so your characterization of a wide array of these people as "1MB" is pretty misleading.

Yes, "patches that any number of developers couldn't get into Bitcoin Core" *for good reasons*.
Core developers (and Blockstream, as well as Blockstream's investors) seem to prioritize decentralization, un-censorable transactions, transaction privacy, and store of value (in other words aspiring Bitcoin to be "digital gold") a heck of a lot more than do Gavin &amp; Hearn, who seem to prioritize above all else "scalability" (as if Bitcoin was invented to simply compete against Visa).
Furthermore, Hearn's world even derides the 'cypherpunk' philosophy that is behind the drive (and Bitcoin's original creation by Satoshi, and influence by Nick Szabo and the other cypherpunks on the mailing list) to make Bitcoin be digital gold.
As a specific example, regarding XT's included "anti-DoS" code, see this Twitter thread (Wladamir) and bitcoin-dev post (Greg M):








Do you agree, or disagree, with these characterizations?
P.S. Both sides may ultimately desire the same end result (price appreciation of bitcoin), but I think a much better argument could be made that the digital gold avenue will more likely lead to that result (e.g. see Wences Casares' arguments). Gold represents a 7 USD trillion market, so bitcoin as 'gold 2.0' targets a huge potential market...

If he is truly as devoted to this project as he says he is and as could be inferred from all the work currently done, then that alone would make the project worthy of recognition.
If I (or you?) could offer him only one suggestion, that would be for him to accelerate the bitcoin aspect / integration of the project, in order to be able to leverage the bitcoin community to assist overall development.

Why is it a terrible experience? It is about tradeoffs.
* 12 words are extremely easy to secure, in the sense they are only 12 random words. They can be kept in a house safe or a bank safe, they can be written inconspicuously in a book split up on multiple pages and left in the house, etc. Because it's just 12 random words, the possibilities are endless really. The 12 words can even be split up and secured in multiple locations and multiple formats.
* It eliminates trust of iCloud, and trust of AirBitz. The backup is completely in the hands of the user.
* Securing 12 words can be done carelessly (such as by taking a screenshot that can potentially be accessed by other apps later, or writing it on a paper that is left in plain sight, or simply losing the words), leading to loss.

This is actually the biggest way, probably. So many trillions of dollars are held in checking accounts, yet the banks mostly share almost none of the interest that accumulates with the customer. And most customers don’t realize they could earn higher interest with a savings account or money market account, so the situation doesn’t change.

The XT manifesto says Hearn makes the final decision if there is a conflict. Further, it's only Hearn and Gavin (but again, really Hearn) calling the shots. It is essentially a 'benevolent dictator' model and, especially with Hearn being the dictator, it's a very scary idea. (see below for why scary)
There is no such rule with Core. Sometimes, Wladamir has merged commits that have later been un-merged by others on the team with commit access. Instead of 2 people, I think there's 5 people with extra privileges. It is a 'consensus' model, where Wladamir is moreso a "maintainer" rather than "dictator".
Why scary? I'm not being hyperbolic... read [this thread's]( main post, then read [this comment]( by Hearn. If you want to read more, see the responses and Hearn's followup comments. Personally, I think it is a whole another level of insane. I can't think of a single other high-profile bitcoin developer who would even dare to rationalize blacklisting or censoring transactions. It completely goes against Bitcoin. Before I saw this, I only felt instinctively that something was maybe wrong with Hearn. After reading all that, I'm terrified.
Either way, I don't think 'benevolent dictator' can work with any current developer. It only worked earlier, since Satoshi was the inventor (so he possessed inherent authority) and also had no known linkable real-world identity.

Wow, way to make a mountain out of a molehill...
*Exhibit A*:




This means Peter Wuille, Greg Maxwell, and Gavin Andresen all agreed in principle with this idea of a document outlining governing principles, aka a "Zen of Bitcoin", aka a "constitution". Are you now also going to slander these 3 people?
*Exhibit B*:




What was being discussed was simply codifying the basic principles underlying bitcoin, which core devs would abide by. And, any particular codification would only enter into effect *if* ALL the core devs unanimously agreed. This is what Back was agreeing with, when he voiced his initial approval for David Jerry's draft document. Again, you are essentially slandering Back's name over something of zero consequence.

But, Bitcoin is about removing trusted third parties. Hosting a full node on a VPS qualifies as introducing a trusted third party, doesn't it?
Further, having extra expense of $10-40/month (equal to $120-480/year) just to continue running a full node does not seem like something many, if any, will do.


Finally, 100 Mbps connections are very rare, relatively speaking. A 20 Mbps connection can handle a hypothetical block size with 8MB cap, but what if the reality is different? Right now, 99% of bitcoin txs occur off-chain. With larger blocks, there is incentive to pour more txs on-chain due to presumably lower fees and greater capacity of the network to handle more txs. The logical conclusion is the network will swell to use up at least 50% of the extra capacity fairly quickly. Or, if you disagree on that, then explain convincingly why not?
The result of the three things above is that number of full nodes will fall drastically, while introduction of TTPs like VPS to host full nodes will increase. This means Bitcoin will become more centralized, thus ultimately harming its security and value proposition. BitFury's paper recently made the same point, and it was a heavily data-driven paper.

Hey there, I've heard of you guys. Great initiative to focus on privacy / anonymity!
Regarding fees, from your site I see:
* Use Auto to use our smart fee detection algorithm
* Use Priority during times of network stress to ensure quick confirmations
I'm a little confused by this. How does 'Auto' work? Is it a dynamic fee based on network conditions, or something else? If so, then why is there 'priority' option (also seems to be a dynamic fee, or isn't it?)? It may be simpler to have only 'Auto' option and 'Custom', and make 'Auto' the default -- and have 'Auto' be truly dynamic so that it changes fee as needed (no matter the magnitude of the change -- incorporate 'Priority' into 'Auto') to ensure a 1-2 block confirmation. Is that possible?
By the way, can you explain or link me to information on 'CoinJoin Simulation'? A Google search does not reveal any information. From your site, it says:

Yeah, it's annoying sometimes to wait 60 seconds for the sync; however, I think it's definitely worth it in exchange for the knowledge that with SPV you'll *always* have access to the network. Placing a TTP (trusted third party), like a BitPay server, into the picture is a bad thing. The server can be hacked, it can go down (just like Mycelium's server went down during the last stress test), etc. etc.

Using breadwallet normally is not cold storage, but the proposed idea is at least a form of 'cold storage'. The idea says to transfer funds to breadwallet, backup the seed (and maybe a receive address or two?), then wipe the breadwallet seed from the phone. This means those funds will always be recoverable with the backed up seed phrase written on paper (the 'cold storage'), while the funds can otherwise not be accessed.
One could also introduce the step of turning on 'airplane mode' to temporarily disconnect the iPhone from all networks (cellular, wifi, bluetooth, etc.) in the initial step of creating a new breadwallet wallet and recording the seed and receive address. Once those two pieces of info are recorded, the wallet could be wiped, and airplane mode turned back off.

Wow, so I've heard about this issue in the past, but never read Hearn's actual words. In that thread, he made a few comments:


Based on that comment, he is actually justifying his actions (no denial even) to have redlists / blacklists. Wow... wow, wow. Having the ability to censor transactions completely goes against the point of Bitcoin. For him to justify censoring transactions, regardless of the reason, appears to be just bonkers.
He refers to Tor as an example. Ironically, here he is speaking almost in sadness that Tor is unfairly being marginalized by legitimate businesses. Yet 'today', he proposes lowering the priority of Tor nodes connecting to XT nodes... without remembering that he previously seemed to believe Tor is often used for good.
Reading this, I almost feel that Hearn may actually want XT to succeed, and may be trying to coopt Bitcoin and convert Bitcoin to Bitcoin XT so that, in his misguided view, Bitcoin is not left as a niche cryptocurrency ostracized by 'legitimate' businesses. If this is true, it means this is much bigger than scalability and he will be far less likely to agree to 'compromise'. It may mean a possible future could be two different Bitcoins: a 'purist' Bitcoin (Core) and a 'tamed' Bitcoin (XT)... assuming both survive, and assuming XT is able to siphon off enough mining power and market cap to give it some momentum to survive the initial chaos.
^ Hopefully I'm just being overly dramatic / imaginative, and Hearn is not really of that mindset. It feels like a very potentially dangerous situation though; I didn't realize Hearn had such extreme views. But if it somehow is true, I would hope Gavin, sooner rather than later, recognizes the insanity and abandons XT / Hearn.

Gavin's comparison actually is very disingenuous, which is why Szabo mocked it. Most nodes are online 24/7 to process transactions, but a user only browses webpages a small part of the day. This is just one reason why Gavin's comparison makes no sense, rather being a smartass reply.

Good point about the ability to fork... wonder what the counterpoint is, if any.
Not sure about Gavin, but why not Nick Szabo? He would appear to be the wisest person, having invented 'bit gold' which was the theoretical underpinning of Satoshi's bitcoin. Out of all people and after considering all the evidence, Szabo (and Hal Finney) has been noted as one of the most likely to be Satoshi. This would indicate Szabo would be the ideal benevolent dictator. I'm also against Gavin taking that role, since Gavin does not seem to properly prioritize privacy/anonymity. The only ones who do are people like Nick Szabo (and Greg Maxwell + Adam Back). These people are all basically "cypherpunks" -- Gavin is not.
On a side note, I certainly agree Gavin would be a far, far, far better choice than Mike Hearn, yet their joint XT project curiously decided to put Hearn in charge as the final decider. If Gavin held that role instead, I think people would have been, at least incrementally, more open to XT. Hearn is too abrasive and aggressive, kind of akin in some ways to Peter Todd (especially in Todd's earlier days). Both are intelligent, but their social skills and consensus-building skills are lacking.

Hi Maxwell, I've wondered about this dilemma myself, to consider how I respond and what is the best way.
If I may give one idea, the best way to handle it is to let go of all emotions or assumptions about another person's motivations. Humans are by nature emotional, so this is asking a lot, but at least with online interactions like Reddit, try to remove all emotion and, if you disagree with someone (like here with u/Peter__R), then just state everything from your post, minus the emotional parts (accusations, scolding, mild derision, assumptions about motives, etc.). In other words, only state 100% facts (that can be backed up, if needed, with evidence), and let those facts/truth speak for themselves. Truth always wins out... eventually, especially with a transparent medium like Reddit, where it's exceedingly easy for someone to view another's comments later and call one out.
Also, don't worry about the 'sockpuppets' or 'trolls'. Their responses will gradually become known to the wider community as useless, and they will lose consideration. Don't let yourself get emotionally involved by such people. Just speak factually and neutrally without emotion, and leave it at that.
Easiest way, I think, to keep a consistently even keel, though it needs practice to get it down especially if it's not normally part of one's personality (like my own, for example).

This is really nice. Basically, it's a fusion of Gyft (but more selection) + Purse (big discounts).
1. There is huge selection (670) vs. only ~200 at Gyft. It includes common retailers (Walmart, Trader Joe's), gas stations (BP, Shell, Conoco, Citgo, Mobil), grocery stores (Walgreens, ShopRite), etc. Some merchants are in the system, but are 'out of stock' (have no cards available currently), but as the market develops (i.e. as more people sell their gift cards to CardCash), more stock will become available to buy. It's an inevitable result, with greater usage and awareness of the service.
2. Almost universally, it gives *at least* a 0.5-1% discount. This helps to make it worth it to use bitcoin to buy the gift card (since converting USD --&gt; BTC also costs about 1%). Also, although Gyft gives 3-5% discount, it is in the form of 'Gyft points' that only apply to future gift card purchases. CardCash's discount is instant and requires no future purchase.

Is it logical that Bitcoin decided to choose 10 minutes for 1 confirmation, if it could have been set at 2.5 minutes or hell, even 1 minute or 10 seconds? No. It takes 0 effort to write into the code "10" vs. "2.5". Hence, it's sensible to imagine (and in fact true) that Litecoin changed that number just as a marketing gimmick, and that it results in no practical benefit.

Also, keep in mind that the mining electricity use is the whole point behind 'Proof of Work'. The system is based on the security afforded by expensive work done in a competitive environment. Just like gold takes work to dig out of the ground and process, bitcoin takes work (in the form of mining and electricity) to produce. The electricity use is intended and a good thing.

You're just arguing for arguing sake. The fact that bitcoin has a $4 billion market cap, while the next highest altcoin, Litecoin, has a $150 million market cap (26x smaller), means the market has already decided that bitcoin represents the main cryptocurrency. It has nothing to do with being 'stupid' and everything to do with the fact that the fight is already over. Bitcoin has won, so get over it. When it comes it money, network effect is everything.

Did I say at all either that: 1) LN exists right now, or that 2) LN does not need bigger blocks? I'm not sure why this is so controversial.
My only intention, and actually all that I said explicitly, was that block size needs to be considered in context of the estimated time of arrival (ETA) of Lightning. If LN did not exist even in theory, then block size would be the only way to scale Bitcoin. Since LN does exist in theory and is being built as we speak, block size should be increased in a way that considers the timeline of LN development. The reason for doing it carefully is that increasing block size has tradeoffs.

Yep! Imagine how cool it would be for a child from birth to learn financial responsibility, and start saving *and* investing into an account with compounding returns straight from the beginning?
You could teach the child to think about the world analytically and critically, and to learn to delay gratification to achieve greater rewards. Imagine eliminating from that child's life all that otherwise wasted money that, by the time they're 20, they could instead have saved and that could have compounded itself up to far larger amounts of money..!
I kinda did the same thing myself, albeit of my own volition and only late when I was already 10, so that while most kids my age would spend their birthday money and gifts from relatives, I just decided to save 95% of everything.

Agreed. Some say the answer to that question is that, right now, you can't really make a good enough argument to US citizens to value BTC above USD purely for economic reasons ("better money"). (The target may have to be citizens of countries where the currency is more volatile and where the economy is more mismanaged.)
For US citizens, different reasons would have to be used, such as: 1) investment (betting on future appreciation due to use by developing country citizens, or use as as a globally accessible store of value like digital gold that can evade capital controls), 2) store of value (digital gold), 3) utility purchasing items from across the world from merchants accepting BTC and not having to pay currency conversion fees, 4) utility purchasing 'illicit' items (DNM), 5) utility in the future by using it on prediction markets, 6) utility in the future online for micropayment purposes, 7) utility as better form of online payment in terms of no potential for losing PII and needing a new credit card after merchants get hacked, 8) no unsolicited payments to merchants (push vs. pull), 9) no customer info collated by credit card companies for marketing purposes, etc.

I can attempt to clarify.
1. "use shapeshift to convert your bitcoins to nubits should you choose to deposit bitcoins" = conversion fee on your end, paid by the user, from bitcoins --&gt; nubits
2. "you can also deposit directly with nubits" = conversion fee on user's end, paid by the user, from bitcoins --&gt; nubits
The users here on r/bitcoin will encounter a fee in both scenarios.

I'm a little concerned.

So, even though it is a fairly aggressive approach, it still won't work? Suggesting that pure block size increase simply won't work to scale Bitcoin, thus necessitating alternate approaches? (like Lightning, etc.)

Breadwallet (iOS) and Airbitz (iOS/Android) both support BIP70.
@_date: 2015-07-14 17:11:21
1) In case you did not realize, this is r/bitcoin. Further, I believe quite strongly that Bitcoin is the only 'legitimate' cryptocurrency around, owing to the fact that it was invented first (by Satoshi), which by definition makes the follow-up coins clones or 'hacks'. Thus, while literally telling a friend about Bitcoin is 'pumping' it, I don't think the negative connotation of 'pumping' can be associated with the act of promoting Bitcoin.
Further with this argument, Bitcoin represents 90% of the total cryptocurrency market cap, while the next-highest alt (excluding premined, centralized Ripple from these calculations) constitutes 4% of the market cap. And Monero? 0.1% of the market cap. Just going by these numbers alone, promoting the buying of *any* alt, much less something like Monero that is miniscule despite being on the market for years (its competitor Bytecoin is nearly double the size, so why not mention Bytecoin? although even that remains at 0.2% of market cap), is tantamount to 'pumping', while promoting Bitcoin with 90% of the market cap is steering someone to a new and market-legitimized technology.
2) Promoting the use of "a service like xmr.to or shapeshift" to convert BTC to XMR is the very definition of "pumping Monero", i.e. the point is XMR gets bought, while BTC gets sold.
3) As for anonymity, while cryptonote has good peer review and is more or less validated, buying into miniscule tiny altcoins is not a prudent piece of advice to someone. This is especially true when you consider that "loving anonymity" is not justification for that. Hundreds of thousands of people, or millions, already successfully use Bitcoin for their purposes. Those who want more privacy use CoinJoin (i.e. JoinMarket), and in the pipeline is Blockstream's sidechains and research on 'Confidential Transactions' which can be integrated into the protocol or left as a sidechain feature. No one is exactly crying out for more privacy of the cryptonote nature, coupled with the danger of investing in a 0.1% altcoin and using the immature and limited software options part of the Monero ecosystem.
4) Further, Monero comes with its own tradeoffs, as cryptonotes cannot scale well by the nature of their technology (pruning isn't possible). There are other issues with Monero too, so promoting a simple and naive narrative, like "if you love anonymity and bitcoin, buy monero", is not in the best interest of anyone here. How does loving Bitcoin have anything to do with buying Monero? It's so absurd...

Here's what I see:


@_date: 2015-07-22 02:41:22
You're dropping buzzwords, bro. Buzzwords that were coined in the Monero subreddit lol, but I thought you'd be smart enough not to parrot those silly buzzwords outside the circle-jerk environment ;)? I'll qualify my use of the term 'buzzwords' by referring to all my previous posts so far in this thread. If Bitcoin had no privacy traits and was incapable of adding any real privacy, then sure, Monero would be a great coin (and hence a great investment). But alas, this not the case now, and it is certainly not the case with each passing day. I've so far only mentioned core protocol changes that increase privacy, but all kinds of developers are working on 'layer 2' privacy enhancements that increase privacy at the wallet level (e.g. DarkWallet with built-in CJ + stealth addresses, Samourai Wallet, etc.).


Monero is an altcoin. Every other coin is an altcoin. Whether the code base was independent or not is not really a concern. Like I said in the previous post, what matters is how revolutionary (how much more different than Bitcoin) is the coin. Ethereum is the only coin right now that can even claim to fall in that camp (and I've given my issues with that line of reasoning in the prior post).


Again, you're comparing to bitcoin (2 yrs vs. 1 yr), but that comparison is not valid. You're using a buzzword "first private blockchain" that is false. It's not the first private one; Darkcoin and other cryptonotes existed long before. It is a derivative, which even if it's fair, means that it was not "first". First is everything. It's also not going to remain the "first private blockchain" forever; see the beginning of this post and the prior posts for the response to that argument.


Nope, unless the opponent is law enforcement, pseudoanonymity is plenty. No one except LE is going to have access (with a warrant) to PII of a person. Hence, no one except LE is going to be able to decipher the gibberish of wallet txs on blockchain.info. Hence, the pseudoanonymity is sufficient (for now). Even LE access is proven to be not a huge concern every day, as DNM activity continues unabated day after day and its volume of trade is actually increasing, despite the immoral exit scams by some DNM operators.
Also, I'm growing hoarse with repeating myself, but there's also right now CJ to muddy the trail, and future -- CT, SCs, Lightning, and others.


Funny you mention corporations, check this out:




This is the CTO of DAH (headed by Blythe Masters, the most powerful female manager at JPM) literally endorsing CT as going "99% of the way" in terms of privacy, as far as his company is concerned (and DAH will be in the specific business of moving around huge quantities of all kinds of financial assets, where privacy is of the utmost importance). If it's such a viable solution for him, you can imagine it's viable for all corps. and certainly for users.
Another point of note in this example is that the CTO of such a significant firm is clearly laser focused on Bitcoin and even on a niche tech, CT by Maxwell. This is yet more evidence of the famed 'network effect' manifesting itself. There is nary a thought towards any "privacy-specialized" altcoin. It's a "Bitcoin, or nothing" situation. And you can bet that Kfir will further be offering his input on CT as development progresses, resulting in a better end product.
It's also ironic, but the huge desire for privacy by corporations will itself end up incentivizing quality Bitcoin privacy tech (as shown with DAH &amp; CT), as well as shielding it from scrutiny... indirectly, by providing an alibi, and directly, by providing Bitcoin with corporations to defend it (via the powerful people of influence at their helms: in the case of DAH, CEO Blythe Masters, who herself has already made public appearances at Bitcoin conferences advocating 'distributed ledger' tech). You can bet all the powerful VCs (e.g. Andreessen Horowitz) will also have plenty of power to package privacy-enhancing Bitcoin tech in PC ways for media consumption.

You basically were antagonizing Maxwell (literally what you said was rude and antagonistic and dismissive, and belittling), without trying to support your argument by providing facts. If you weren't going to argue based on facts, and instead make antagonistic comments, I can imagine why you would end up getting banned (for causing a ruckus + not contributing to the discussion).

False, Monero has a view key that also allows it to be public, if users wish.


Bitcoin is pseudonymous, not public. It can further become private right now itself, via CoinJoin and Tor, and via a whole host of other measures (as listed in prior post) in due time.
I did not dismiss Monero "because Bitcoin can also be private". I dismiss Monero (and actually I didn't dismiss Monero nor did I call it a deception; I dismissed your pumping Monero in r/bitcoin, and I called you a deception because of that pumping on this sub) because it's a pipsqueak of a coin with no network effect (practically no ecosystem), just like virtually *every other* altcoin in existence, and because it's already kinda obsolete (due to Bitcoin's existing privacy measures) and will become further obsolete soon. Bitcoin already has most of the users, the mining hashrate, the developers, the businesses, and the VC investment; privacy is a secondary objective (since Bitcoin is already pseudonymous, which is good enough for 99%), which will be addressed in due time. CT is currently being refined with a new proposal to even further optimize the code; when it's mature, it will either be integrated into the Bitcoin protocol, or available via SCs.
On that note of my last sentence, I recommend watching at least 2 videos. Maxwell, a Bitcoin core dev, is one of the most passionate advocates of having real privacy in Bitcoin, and you can rest assured he will manifest that priority within Bitcoin (CT, SCs):
1. 
2. 
You guys can deny the importance of network effect all you want, but there is a reason Bitcoin has 90% of the cryptocurrency market cap, while even the next-highest altcoin (Litecoin) has only 3.5% (and before the recent Chinese ponzi pump, it was more like 2%). And Litecoin only has that much capital attributed to it because it is seen as "silver" to Bitcoin's "gold"... which in my opinion is kinda a bogus analogy, since cryptocurrency is infinitely divisible and thus has no need for a 'silver' that can be purchased at lower cost... so I wouldn't be surprised if Litecoin's value evaporated in the coming years.

As u/nullc would say, "Welcome to Reddit!" 'new user'. I don't know why I'm responding to a troll, but I'll humor you.
What distinguishes a Bitcoin enthusiast is that the enthusiast is 'for' something (Bitcoin), which is a relatively harder position to take. He / she is for it because he / she recognizes the value of it. Meanwhile, detractors like yourself (as well as r/buttcoin and Krugman and co.) are 'against' something (Bitcoin), which is a relatively easier position to take. It's easy to be against something, by virtue of being ignorant about the subject.
In this specific example, what Krugman was saying was nonsense, yet he, the interviewer, and various members of the audience felt compelled to make various nonverbal gestures (smirking, gesturing with hands, laughing, etc.) to: a) suggest how ludicrous Bitcoin is, b) attempt to seek support of that position by fellow clueless people, and c) reinforce the position.

Hmm, is this why after 6 years, the market (arguably the most objective assessment tool, in comparison to you and r/buttcoin) values each bitcoin at $275, and values the sum total of bitcoins at 4 billion USD (i.e. 4,000,000,000 USD)? Again, what the market thinks matters a lot more than what r/buttcoin thinks. If bitcoins were useless "Dunning-krugerands", then it seems impossible that they are valued collectively at 4 billion USD after having been on the market for 6 years.

Yes, altcoins are scams because Bitcoin already won. Altcoiners, by definition, represent people "late to the party", who are just trying to pump 'n dump and repeat Bitcoin's financial success for themselves. Since altcoins lack much reason to exist, their very existence is unnecessary and hence superfluous. Thus, they only exist to allow mindless speculation and pump 'n dump schemes. In other words, altcoins are scams.

Proof? If you define 'streaks of authoritarianism' by the two of you not sharing the same views, then clarify that. Authoritarianism means he lacks concern for what others think and thinks highly of authority, both of which are false as far as what I've observed.
I think you could describe Luke, however, very much with that word. He both seems to completely lack regard for others' views / concerns, and has an eerily high regard for authority (in the form of all laws, regardless if the law is sensible or not).
Please do not unfairly denigrate people in the community, like Maxwell, who are extremely capable and have done a lot for Bitcoin (just one example: his recent work on 'Confidential Transactions'), just because you personally disagree with their view. If you look up nullc's posts, he makes a lot of effort to explain the rationale for his views carefully.
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:04:42
Sorry, but that is not true in any way.
The vast, vast majority of altcoins are pump 'n dump scams, that invent bogus features purported to be 'superior' and 'advantages' over Bitcoin: e.g. PoS being 'environmentally friendly' and 'just as secure as PoW', Litecoin's 'faster' confirmation times and 'ASIC resistance', etc. It's quite endless really, and most of the features are marketing gimmicks that lack peer review. [Sorry for namedropping, but it's actually a pity that there are so many scams, because then peer-reviewed technology like cryptonote (bytecoin, monero, xdn) gets left to the wayside, although it's possible the market does not assign them greater value for legitimate reasons, such as poorly developed ecosystems or threat for becoming obsolete due to bitcoin privacy technology (confidential transactions, coinjoin, future sidechain tech)]. The ultimate test to prove this? The fact that the market has not given legitimacy to any of the alt coins, shown by Bitcoin retaining 90% of the market cap of cryptocurrencies. In fact, Litecoin is  most will say only because it is seen as "silver" to Bitcoin being "gold", not  for any legitimate reason. And  is Ripple, due to it being seen as a more centralized alternative for banks than the rest of cryptocurrencies.
In reality, the purpose of all these coins is to make the coin creator rich, since it's a simple (yet obviously immoral) way to cash in on the cryptocurrency fascination. Just like when the internet first came about, there were lots of scams, which is the same story today with cryptocurrency.
As for competition, sure it's good, and that's what pushes bitcoin development and the ecosystem to be so dynamic and vibrant. You mentioned it's not good if all that existed was Microsoft, but that's not comparable to Bitcoin. The Microsoft example can be compared to Coinbase, which is why there is also Circle and other companies.
More on this, is there more than 1 internet today? No. Bitcoin is a 'protocol' and comparable to the internet; hence, there is no logical reason for a second cryptocurrency to exist, let alone 500. Do you think merchants should have options to pay in 500 different cryptocurrencies, or that wallets should support 500 cryptocurrencies, or that in the future products should be priced in not only BTC but also have prices in 500 other cryptocurrencies? Fundamentally, it makes no sense.
It makes sense to only support BTC (which has 90% of the crypto market cap, so Backpage loses barely anything by not accepting altcoins), instead of exposing users to 'altcoins', because most: 1) are pure scams, 2) have even more volatility than BTC, 3) will confuse new users by having so many options to choose from, when all people want is a well-supported (aka, large ecosystem, which ONLY bitcoin offers) alternative to fiat.
Simply put, money is not a game, no matter how much it's turned into a game and a light manner by the cryptocurrency community. For that reason, the responsible thing is for new users to be directed toward bitcoin and encouraged to remain in bitcoin only, and only use certified legitimate companies, ideally those vetted by a transparent open-source service like  There are far too many scams targeted at gullible users for cryptocurrency to be viable, otherwise.

Hi, it looks like a great movie; congrats on finishing it!
But, considering the subject matter is 'Bitcoin' and 'end of [fiat] money', I feel it would be more appropriate to prominently advertise  as a main way to watch the movie "if paying in bitcoin" and the vimeo link "if paying in US dollars, etc.". As it is, the YouTube trailer for the movie has been updated only with the Vimeo link, and the tweets about the movie again only include the Vimeo link. If there was no 'pay with Bitcoin' option, that would be another story, but there really doesn't seem to be any excuse.
It feels a bit 'fake' otherwise, as if the creators want to make money from the 'Bitcoin fad' but don't personally care much for *using* Bitcoin and don't believe what they themselves are saying. -- not meaning to criticize here, just letting you know how it *feels* from an outside perspective, which like I said I'm sure is not in any way close to the actual truth.

You're right, nice catch. Although, I'm not sure if CoinTelegraph is participating in the scam, or just inadvertently got caught reporting on them without doing enough due diligence first. Also, thank you and thanks to the other r/Buttcoin -ers in the main thread, who have helped to point out the various inconsistencies and posted some research on the shill accounts. Not sure why you guys are helping out like this, but thanks.
I remember seeing this thread on the front page and thinking the phrase "sustainable bitcoin investment packages" sounded quite dubious, but I ignored it and got caught up with something else actually worthwhile. I've looked over the thread a bit now though, and noticed a few things:
* The shill comments (by those with older accounts, yet sparse recent activity) are highly upvoted, yet upvoted for no particularly logical reason. In other words, the upvoting is highly suspicious, and there is little to no follow-up discussion.
* Any comments by r/Bitcoin regulars questioning it have been downvoted to negatives, again without reasons given or discussion, although this seems to be slowly changing now as they are being upvoted.
* Almost no regulars, or those with an actual recent history in r/Bitcoin, have posted positive comments
* The thread itself is net upvoted +75% with net 34 upvotes. This makes no sense, given the above, and given the content of the thread. Normally, this would not happen on r/Bitcoin.
The above makes it seem like there is an active vote manipulation campaign in effect. That the scammer was able to procure 'older' Reddit accounts to post shill comments shows at least a fair amount of sophistication, so it's not surprising that vote manipulation has also occurred.
More evidence here:

OP, I browsed your posts and even you tend to often post in a troll-like (more specifically, ignorant) manner (e.g.  asserting things without the slightest humility, even though what you're saying is obviously not true.
I browse through r/Bitcoin whenever I have free time and, being immersed in it, I can flatly say that the majority here are not going to downvote and ignore legitimate criticism or legitimate issues.
e.g. I recently posted  and it was upvoted within minutes and reached the top of the front page. It's at 94% upvoted and 219 upvotes. This was 'criticism' of Bitcoin and showed a temporary 'failure' -- hardly an example of endlessly "positive media and a huge circle jerk".
The stuff that's downvoted is either obvious trolling, or it's phrased in a provocative way that implies no desire on OP's part to learn something (rather just trying to make a point).
e.g. You linked to a grand total of 1 example, and that was after you were prompted in the comments to provide examples -- "Forks in blockchain. Spamming of unconfirmed transactions. ActualMoney users not affected." -- this example shows a person saying false things: there's no fork in the blockchain in the recent past, there is spamming yes but so what? (it's an experiment; Bitcoin itself is still in a 'beta' stage and actively being developed, no one claims Bitcoin is 100% solid and fully developed yet. Then, the user ends with a 'provocative' statement (ActualMoney users not affected), which again besides being provocative (aka, trollish), is also false in so many ways (actualmoney = fiat, which is not actually 'money', in fact bitcoin represents 'money' far more than fiat currency does; actualmoney users get to have their money frozen by banks, actualmoney users have capital control restrictions even under normal circumstances i.e. in the US there are limits to how you can use your money, or how much you can transfer somewhere). I could write so much more on this, but I think this should suffice.
Yes, there's a minority of people on this sub, who are either zealots, uninformed, or are bitter and cynical due to experience with trolls, mainly Buttcoiners (e.g. 77moody77). But, your implication that the sub as a whole is of this nature is objectively wrong -- and the fact you'd take a few misguided experiences and be bold enough to create a thread asking if the sub is "degenerating into a cult" just further shows your lack of maturity and credibility in this regard. You did not even provide any example when originally creating the thread, which a sensible person would do if they wanted to make a serious point. Since you don't seem to value evidence highly, it's hard to take you or those like you seriously.
To end, people like you are a dime a dozen to be honest. You don't understand Bitcoin yourself, yet you refuse to think that may be possible... and refuse to think maybe you should first educate yourself on the topic a bit, and have some humility before making unfounded accusations that the sub is a 'cult' or that 'legitimate criticism is downvoted'. It's tiring to care what you guys think, or bother responding (simpler to just downvote and move on), but I'm deciding to respond here to hopefully have some effect. Is my hope misplaced? Probably, owing to your personality and the fact you seem to have already made up your mind, but I'm happy to be wrong.

From the article:








Basically, I think it's basically saying there are a limited number of slices of pizza in a day (144 block in a day). The top mining pool A with 22% share of hashrate earns .22*144 = 31.68 blocks/day on average. If smaller mining pool B does a block withholding attack with a small piece of hashpower, B will disrupt A so that maybe it then earns only 30 blocks/day on average. This means 1.68 blocks become open to be discovered by other pools. If B was the  mining pool and remains  in hashrate, even after using some of its hashrate for the attack, then it will still have a higher probability than the other pools of earning the rewards from those now-available 1.68 blocks.
If pool A is not aware of attacks (because attacks can be anonymous), but it knows attacks are possibly reducing its profit, then it makes sense for A to also reserve some amount of hashrate to attack a pool (to try to negate the possible advantage being secretly gained by the other pool).
disclaimer: I'm no expert on mining, but this is what seems logical on the surface.

I don't think this is an issue, since prostitution is not by default considered illegal in much of the developed world. This is because, really, the problem lies in trafficking and exploitation, which are fostered when prostitution is declared illegal and forced to move underground.


As you can see, the U.S. outlaws prostitution in most states, but it's actually legal to varying degrees in: Canada, Central America, South America, Europe, and Australia.
This measured German article ( -- use Google Translate) by a very large newspaper kinda gives an example or preview of the reaction by the public. Its air of balance is also more remarkable considering the publication is considered "unabashedly conservative and nationalist" in Germany.
In summary, there are very good arguments why prostitution should be legal (which is why much of the developed world has legalized it), so I don't foresee much criticism or, in the light of criticism, there shouldn't be much difficulty in countering the criticism and defending what is essentially 'freedom to transact and earn a living in "humanity's oldest profession"'.
P.S. Ironically, you dismiss the Greece crisis as a safe role in which Bitcoin can intervene, but I'd put fighting with national governments, private banks, and central banks (basically the existing financial system and the political system that's enmeshed with it), by using Bitcoin for "circumventing capital controls," as a far more difficult task because it will put up Bitcoin against far more powerful opponents.

While AirBitz has made great strides in its UI/UX, especially with the very latest iOS update!!, I still think Breadwallet is  in the UI/UX department (kinda like the 'Apple' of Bitcoin wallets). I don't think it can be objectively argued that Airbitz's interface is easier to grasp and use than Breadwallet's.
Also, now that I think about it, breadwallet is also functionally superior by being an SPV wallet (directly connecting to the Bitcoin network to make transactions and verify -- no 'trusted third party' servers).

Rusty, can you please do me a favor, and ignore obvious trolls / ingrates, like u/ToroArrr and u/finway? Please, they are not worth your time, or worth getting aggravated over. I admire your desire and willingness to respond and try to clear up misconceptions, but for people like these guys, there is simply no point, so save your effort for people who know basic civility.
It's clear from their very first comments, e.g. "Jesus just release the damn product or stop talking about it" -- said in response NOT to you, but to another guy who made this thread, which is completely illogical, right? That should be a signal that the person who posted the comment is an utter idiot. Or, e.g. take the first comment by the other guy -- "get out of the way we scaling up." -- 1) can't write proper English, 2) is categorically rude and obnoxious and frankly ignorant. Those are some more signals to simply downvote if you like, to do your part to relegate their useless posts to the dustbin, but otherwise ignore because there is no hope for such people.
Maybe, one strategy is to use a tool like RES (reddit enhancement suite) to label such users as soon as you find them (or mute or block, if RES allows it), so that you can spend as little time as possible even reading their drivel, much less responding to it.
I just don't want you to get burned out, Rusty, or to have a bad impression of this subreddit, when really it is a few bad socially inept, or just stupid, bad apples who represent the absolute bottom.

Thanks cypherdoc2, but this is not exactly the proof I requested that explicitly associates Blockstream with a conflict of interest in the block size debate; it's just a solitary definition of 'conflict of interest'. Even so, I can respond to this.


1. You've highlighted 'potentially', but by taking such a liberal and ambiguous interpretation, this can be applied to almost any person speaking on this. Almost every person has one or another conflict of interest, if defined like this. Even Gavin (funded by MIT) could 'potentially' have a conflict of interest, if he was secretly being bribed by an outside party, or even influenced by the Digital Currency Initiative (it's headed by Brian Forde, who was prior politically involved with President Obama's administration, so it's not a stretch that political motivations may intrude) or MIT itself (MIT is known to often work with and do research for the US government).
2. a) Blockstream employees, as stated multiple times by Adam Back, have bitcoin compensation released via time-locked contracts, which means they are incentivized to work for the benefit of bitcoin now and for the future. b) Further, their contract gives them 1 year of paid leave, if they wish to work on a Bitcoin project independent of Blockstream, if for some reason they feel Blockstream is going against the interests of the community. c) All of Blockstream's main projects (sidechains + Lightning) are fully open-source (public GitHub and public mailing list), and can be forked at any time and used / examined by anybody. -- All 3 of these things contradict the idea that there exists a conflict between the interests of Blockstream vs. the interests of bitcoin. Rather, what seems quite clear is that the interests of Blockstream and bitcoin are completely aligned. &lt;-- further supported of course by the fact that many in the technical community, outside of those affiliated with Blockstream, have also come out against a contentious hard fork that raised block size (especially including Wladamir for example, who like Gavin is also funded by MIT).


This example has to do with fiduciary interest. There is no attorney, accountant, business advisor, or realtor among the Blockstream developers who have opined on the debate.

Yes, incentives exist with the altcoin system since premining is possible and the market rate is free and can fluctuate (i.e. increase in value). I don't deny this. However, while this system is good for the creators of alts, it's a poor system for end users.
Once sidechains arrive, it will be trivial to clone an existing altcoin in its entirety, but instead have the market rate (price) of the altcoin pegged to bitcoin's rate. This means all of Bitcoin's existing superiority (more stable exchange rate due to large market cap, less cost due to tighter spreads due to high liquidity, compatibility with the already existing high development of Bitcoin ecosystem and services, and other benefits of Bitcoin's network effect) will be drawn upon by the sidechained altcoins.
This is obviously better for users, but not good for altcoin developers since their work will essentially be appropriated or devoured by Bitcoin. I'm not saying it is good or bad... it just 'is'. It will become the reality.
And yes, altcoins are here and offer some utility, but without Bitcoin's network effect, they are doomed to remain tiny, as they are right now. Al the alts except Litecoin (which itself is basically just an inferior Bitcoin clone) have tiny market caps and tiny liquidity.
As for bitshares and their having 'solved volatility'... I don't think volatility is anything that needs solving. Volatility is a natural state of new assets, until they find a stable value. The point of Bitcoin is to be an asset without counterparty risk. USD and GLD *do* have counterparty risk and are part of the current system; Bitcoiners want to have their own independent system. If one wants USD, you can just buy USD. If you want gold, it's better to buy ohysical gold, not a gold IOU (like GLD).
@_date: 2015-07-08 17:18:15
That's not true. Remember that the *real* demand right now is about 120,000 transactions/day. With the spam, it's increased to 200,000 transactions/day. That extra 80,000 represents spammers sending 1/4 cents transactions. If fees naturally rise among the legitimate 120,000 transactions from ~2.5 cents to ~5 cents, then spammers will be forced to double the cost of their attack. If they are not willing to pay more, then the spam should end.

Uh, no chip. I couldn't care less about any individual here, only their arguments and the information they give. No prejudices here :). And btw, if you're implying you removed my comment from this thread, that's kind of absurd. There would be zero justification, and that would be defined purely as 'censorship' -- if you disagree, I'd welcome you to dissect my original post to explain which piece you think would warrant removal of the whole post, especially as the post received on net +12 upvotes and the thread itself was net voted 0 (+50%), indicating whoever read the thread disagreed. Again, I have nothing personal against jratcliffe or frankly any person. I read r/bitcoin purely for information and increasing my understanding of Bitcoin and its ecosystem.


I actually gave an opinion, and defended it with arguments. Sorry, if my target was a 'mod' in this case -- am I supposed to remove mods from my criticism? I had no intention of attacking an individual -- I was arguing against what he was saying in the thread and in the recent past of previous threads. If it seemed I was attacking him in a non-substantive manner, then I apologize. But, I don't believe I made any ad-hominem attacks, although please correct me if I'm wrong? Certainly, if you're looking for attacks on people, I can direct you to endless personal and abusive attacks on: u/nullc (Maxwell), Gavin (u/gavinandresen), Adam Back (u/adam3us), Peter Todd (u/petertodd), etc.


Again, my post represented my opinion -- I have every right to give that opinion. And, it was clear the sub who read his thread and my post, on net, agreed with me and disagreed with him (given the 0 upvotes, and my post's +12 upvotes). It clearly was not 'obvious' to the sub...
Furthermore, the reason I felt as I did was this comment by jratcliffe that started his thread: "There is no question that a lot of bitcoiners think of bitcoin as their lottery ticket get rich quick scheme." -- I believe then and now it was unnecessary and provocative, and literally the way all of r/Buttcoin talks about Bitcoiners.

Not sure I understand you?
With Bitreserve, you send fees to your Bitreserve wallet, then 'peg' to any fiat value or gold for free. When it's time to pay with bitcoin, you then convert back to bitcoin, again for free, and send bitcoin.
With 'Escrow my Bits' or 'NuDroid', you have to pay a fee to convert bitcoins to nubits, and then again at time of sale from nubits to bitcoins.
So, 'Escrow my Bits' = 2 conversion fees, while Bitreserve = 0 conversion fees.

Why not just continue redirecting to bitcoin.org, as was done starting June 2? Bitcoin.org is the most official and legitimate 'homepage' of the Bitcoin project. I don't understand the need to fork it and start over? Further, the current bitcoin,com implementation evidently has become a bought-and-paid-for site that promotes services without regard to merit. It does not offer objective resources for the public, and thus actually does a disservice.
e.g. Pushing people to a crappy wallet like blockchain.info with numerous, chronic security failings and evidence of incompetence may seem minor and harmless right now, but what if in the future many hundreds of thousands or millions of customers lose their bitcoins through it? It will not only be bad PR, but possibly collapse the price of btc as those stolen btc are sold. Just an example.

Altcoins are constantly subject to pump and dumps and more extreme volatility than bitcoin, which admittedly has high volatility itself. But with bitcoin, you're dealing with moving a 4.4 billion USD market, which is much tougher than moving or manipulating any particular 1-20 million USD altcoin market.
Altcoins can only really be feasible if backed by bitcoin as the reserve currency, which is the purpose of sidechains. We already have 2-way federated peg sidechains, btw. The next step is more difficult, but we have a company (Blockstream) funded with 21 million USD devoted to bringing mature sidechains to market.
In my opinion, altcoins are just a ticking time bomb, with bitcoin set to subsume anything useful from them. People complain of bitcoin 'maximalism' or that bitcoiners just want to 'dominate' everything, and feel threatened. But really, it's just inevitable.
For example, Bitcoin is pseudonymous (between anonymous and transparent) which is actually enough for most people, but true anonymity is already possible in Bitcoin through: CoinJoin technology (which is being developed and made ever easier to use i.e. JoinMarket), and privacy is also being targeted via: 'Confidential Transactions' technology ( These developments are not even dependent on development of sidechains, but they alone will lay waste to any privacy-focused altcoins like Dash and cryptonote-based BCN or XMR. Even something as simple as off-chain Lightning transactions will offer true anonymity.
The point is, either by layer 1 direct improvements to the protocol or to wallet software, or by layer 2 improvements (off-chain trustless transactions, sidechains, etc.), it is inevitable that Bitcoin will dominate (and for good reason!! not dominate by force, but by bringing a superior experience).

The problem is that basically every investment in the real world works like this, with varying degrees of 'fairness' (accessibility), whether it is a brand new idea that is funded by the founder's family, a private raising of funds (like that participated in by angel investors and VCs), or a stock listed on the public market, etc. etc.
Bitcoin happens to be an asset that had most early exposure by people in the relevant fields: cypherpunks, cryptography, computer science, libertarians, Silicon Valley, etc.
Basically, there was nothing outright *unfair* about early adopter's investment into Bitcoin, which I think is the crux of the matter about why it is in fact fair. Anyone who wanted to, at mostly any point in Bitcoin's maturity, had the opportunity to mine bitcoins, or buy bitcoins on the open market via various exchanges. And, this is still true today. 10 years from now, if bitcoin is worth $10,000/bitcoin, people will still be complaining that it's unfair. But, it really is not... at least, it's certainly not more unfair than virtually every other investment opportunity has been.

I really did not want to say this if I could have skipped it, but if it is so bad that Garzik is unhappy for the same reason, then I guess I shouldn't hold back. If you go into Bitcoin IRC, and even try to mention the idea of making decisions based on the effects on businesses and users (who have become accustomed to low fees), you'll run into massive insensitive pushback that essentially equates to:


^ If the above sounds like a massive parody, I wish it was, but it is not. More or less, it represents the dominant views present on the IRC. The main people with this insensitive-to-reality view are: LukeJr, midnightmagic (or some such name), and a few others who escape my memory. Most on IRC will parrot the same views though. And, if you dare to disagree and try to have a vigorous debate for too long and question the mod, then mods like midnightmagic will simply ban you (not kidding).
I think Harding is probably the most reasonable, and open to debate on the pros/cons of various actions, and Maxwell is also open to having a debate. But, Luke? Very 'noisy' developer, and quite selfish? (insensitive) in his views.
*disclaimer* -- I'm not saying one view or the other on the block size debate is completely correct (pros and cons exist with everything), but I am saying that various people here are utterly, dare I say it, impervious to respecting and considering the genuine interests of *all* parts of the Bitcoin ecosystem. These people are toxic to the debate, and care nothing for end-user experience (and hence, working towards mass adoption).
Transaction count is only estimated in a Tradeblock analysis to reach levels of concern in summer 2016, so there is time to kick the can a bit (increase block size to a lesser amount) and work hard at getting Lightning out before then (the true solution vs. eternally increasing block size).
@_date: 2015-07-14 02:44:43
Lightning actually increases scalability by a factor of about 150x, or practically by more like 'infinity' * x, according to its inventors and according to the peer review done by, for example, various Blockstream employees (like Rusty Russell, who is in charge of implementing Lightning) and Harding (maintainer of bitcoin.org).
Also, see this:




You said this:


Can you clarify what you mean? Lightning is trustless, offers instant secure transactions - in effect secure 0-conf transactions -, and done with extremely low fees (able to allow true micropayments). This sounds exactly like what Bitcoin was attempting to do, in the payment network sense.


I know you've claimed this a lot, but let me attempt to answer your questions on this topic:
* Who locks up bitcoins? The hub.
* How much? 2x the maximum size of a transaction in that particular channel.
* For how long? For as long as the hub and the client want. When will the merchant get the bitcoins? When they close the channel. (Of course, the incentive is for funds to transfer instantly, so this is why funds will be unlocked instantly.)
And, here's an example...
Suppose a hub locks up 100 BTC. Then, say Alice sends 2 BTC to Bob via the hub. What happens?
Alice creates a time-locked transaction paying the hub 2 BTC. The hub offers her a time-locked refund transaction returning her 2 BTC. The hub then offers Bob a time-locked transaction paying him 2 BTC. Bob tells Alice that he received the money. Alice allows the hub to: cancel its refund and accept the 2 BTC she paid the hub. The hub allows Bob to receive the 2 BTC it paid him. Now, Alice is 2 BTC poorer while Bob is 2 BTC richer, and the hub retains its starting amount of BTC.
*disclaimer*: Lightning is great and all, but until it's ready for use, I still do agree we need a stopgap measure or 'bandaid', such as an increase in block size to keep confirmation time and fees reasonable (low).

More context (Chris Dixon's original tweet):


Seeing as the comments in this thread are fairly deplorable in their quality and miss the point completely, by obsessing over the medium (Twitter) via which the information is being communicated, I guess I'll take the opportunity to state the point...
1. Nick Szabo has verified that the majority of Bitcoin developers are in opposition to the positions (Bitcoin XT, etc.) taken by Hearn in the block size debate.
2. Whether Szabo himself also lies on the side of the 'developer mainstream' is not conclusively known, but due to the nature of the tweet it's certainly likely (i.e. Szabo does not support Hearn's views in the debate).
For those who know who Szabo is and his significance to Bitcoin (many posting seem oblivious..), this tweet conclusively puts to rest the conspiracy theories propagated by a minority on Reddit (that Blockstream is in the minority when it opposes the block size increase, that Blockstream devs. oppose the increase due to a conflict of interest, that Blockstream devs promote 'small blocks' to 'cripple' the network to help promote their Lighting and sidechains projects).
For the record, by extension if Szabo had come out today and said he believes Hearn's views are the right ones in this debate, I would have posted the tweet just the same and revised my thinking substantially in favor of Hearn.

Another good thing about Copay is that because it's the main wallet used by BitPay internally within the company, it has many eyes on it, many technical users using it, and incentive to follow high standards and keep the wallet secure. Of course, it's also open-source.
On the other hand, its lack of SPV is a big shortcoming, while most of the other benefits you listed are quite trivial in my opinion.
Still, maybe it is smarter to rely on a wallet like Copay (instead of breadwallet, for example) that has a strong incentive (and the means, i.e. funding) to remain secure, since it is BitPay's funds *and* reputation that are at stake if Copay is compromised.

This implies that 50 million people could make unlimited transactions with 1 MB blocks. How many people actively use Bitcoin today?
With an average of 1.5 TPS (transactions per second) on the network, and 86,400 seconds in 1 day, it means 129,600 transactions/day on average. Even if we assume 1 person per transaction, to max out possible users, it means 129,600 people use the network every day. 50,000,000 / 129,600 = 385.
So, this would appear to mean that 1 MB blocks w/ Lightning allows the network to scale users by 385x, a massive increase. I don't foresee that happening anytime soon. Do you?

In response to your comments suggesting micro-transactions can be supported on-chain, I recommend perusing Peter Todd's comments on the subject. BlockCypher did seem like a good solution to me previously, but it's not tenable for the long-run.
Fees must be raised to some reasonable amount, due to the necessity of guarding the network against DoS spam attacks (in order to keep the network functional). As a result, the *only* viable solution is off-chain.
Luckily, there is an off-chain solution that is entirely trustless, low-cost, and instant (basically a superior version of ChangeTip, which itself is also off-chain): Lightning. Lightning allows infinite lower-value transactions to be made by a user, including the micro-transaction variety (less than $1).
The issue needs to be split into the short-term and the long-term:
* In the long-term, Lightning will solve the problem in the ideal manner.
* In the short-term (until Lightning arrives, which could take 1 or 2 years), we obviously still need a solution. As mentioned earlier, to protect the network against attacks, it would appear that off-chain is the only solution (since fees must rise some amount to make attacks more expensive) in the form of a service like ChangeTip. Bigger blocks would not solve the problem entirely (it might help a little), since making blocks too big at this point comes with its own tradeoffs. Increasing size to a reasonable 2-4MB would only increase the cost of an attack 2-4x, from ~$5,000 to $10,000 or 20,000.
P.S. Thanks for creating this thread. It was a bit unnerving to read how insensitively Luke was responding to the issue, without offering any solutions. Like I said, a solution is definitely needed, even if it's not an ideal solution. I'm glad Maxwell and the rest were more constructive in that respect.

It being shapeshift's fee does not remove the fee though, right? The user does not care where the fee comes from. All that matters is the end result, which is that a fee exists. I wasn't including the 1% escrow fee, which I didn't know about; if you include that, then it becomes even more expensive to use a Nubits solution vs. a non-Nubits (Bitreserve) solution.

Right, if it really does turn out this way, and if Bitcoin ever becomes something a bit more commonly used and sizable, then I have no doubt Google's search ranking algorithms will highly downgrade bitcoin,com's visibility in search results, relative to bitcoin.org. In the community too, bitcoin,com will not have any support relative to bitcoin.org.
Thus, ultimately, I have no doubt that the truth wins out and that bitcoin.org (and even other informative community bitcoin websites with less prominent domain names!) will have far more visibility and relevance than bitcoin,com, regardless of bitcoin,com's perfect domain name. In that case, meritocracy will still win, but I'm hoping that Roger can be convinced to do the right thing now itself.

Short-term 2: Truly decentralized mining via an upcoming genius idea by 21, or other, so that no single entity controls significant hashrate
Medium-term 1: Sidechains to really unleash Bitcoin extensibility and innovation (compete with Ethereum and all other altcoins, to help stop the dilution of the ecosystem by alts and remove the incentive for alt pump-and-dumps that harms cryptocurrency's image)

That is not the way to "rebuild a bigger, better protocol". All that would accomplish is to destroy $4 billion USD worth of trust and early adoption in cryptocurrency. It's super easy to throw around wild dramatic statements like you did, but whether it makes any sense is a different matter. As it is, the protocol *is* being consistently improved, and sidechains are key to continuing the process as bitcoin grows larger. You talk as if Bitcoin development is dead and nothing is happening, when actually the reality is the opposite.

I guess that is a prudent approach.
The current 1 year estimate (if it was right, and if I'm not misremembering it!) is based on only 1 full-time person (Rusty) working on it, along with apparent consultation with Joseph Poon. But, if LN really is seen to be the best solution (and it currently is), then if anything, I'd expect it to be complete sooner rather than later by receiving a lot more community support on the GitHub Lightning project.

Bitcoin already has 4.4 billion USD associated with bitcoins directly, and a further 5 or so billion USD in the rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem (Bitcoin companies, VC investment, etc.).


True, but bitcoin is brand new and has not been given enough time to mature and make its mark, one way or another. As it is, if you compare gold and bitcoins, bitcoin is hugely superior.
As an example, just in one way relevant to BitGold, bitcoin is superior because it is a digital asset that can be stored and easily secured by an individual, while gold is only worthwhile in physical form (one effect of this: the large discount in price between paper gold and physical gold) and so is much more difficult to handle. i.e. Gold is difficult to secure, it's impossible to quickly and securely transmit to another person across distances, and you can hardly use it to pay for anything. ... all in direct contrast to bitcoin, even at the current point in time. Further, Bitcoin is always evolving and being updated since it is just software; who knows what potential will be unlocked as time goes on? Physical gold can never evolve and be 'updated' to any extent compared to Bitcoin.

Ah, true, so the cost is in exchange for using a decentralized solution vs. a centralized solution. I didn't think about that, but it remains to be seen whether that is a true cost for the mainstream user. It may end up being a benefit to use Bitreserve for such a user, owing to an easier user interface and more convenient user experience (no Nubits conversions involved).
I guess the issue for me is that I don't see bitcoin volatility as a long-term problem (and I hold bitcoin for the long-term), so it seems pointless to pay fees to convert back and forth between Nubits. And for those who dislike the volatility, there are bitcoin-based solutions like Tether (for decentralized option), or Bitreserve (centralized option).

This is where I think you're in error.
Let me put it this way. The analytical approach (consistently shown by Tradeblock's blog analyses) determined that the trend of the network's transaction growth since inception shows that by Summer 2016, the network will begin to hit its limit (limit defined by when transactions begin taking longer than 1 block to confirm, which would represent a change in behavior until that point). So, since we have about 1 year, and since Lightning will take about 1 year, it makes sense to consider them together.

I'll answer your snarky comments seriously, and show you why you're wrong.
In the scenario you describe, if BTC even hits $10,000/btc, that means $210 billion is in bitcoin. At that level alone, bitcoin would be a major asset, highly liquid, and much less volatile, meaning no reason at all to sell for fiat. Just slowly liquidate as you would fiat, but continue to hold the majority in bitcoin.

But, then where would you propose a non- tech savvy individual (like an escort or another layperson / non-nerd type) keep larger amounts?
Storing funds in a computer-based wallet or web wallet is out of the question due to easy malware or phishing vulnerability. I guess I could suggest Ledger Nano, but that's a $40 investment that I'm not sure any such person would consider. Maybe the Ledger HW1 (same security, but less durable construction) for $20? That's the cheapest (yet still secure) Bitcoin wallet, but even asking a layperson to pay $20 to store bitcoins sounds like something that would not be received well...
Thus, at least until Bitcoin becomes more mainstream and hardware wallets can get mass-produced and even cheaper, I think a smartphone wallet (ideally iPhone, since it's more secure than Android) is the ideal mix of characteristics, chief among them security and user-friendliness.
P.S. Don't dismiss smartphone wallet security so easily. Think about it. When was the last time you heard of a Breadwallet user (for example) losing his bitcoins due to an attack, or even for that matter due to user error (which can easily come into play with users who aren't tech savvy)? I can't think of even one example of a user losing bitcoins from an attack, and perhaps less than 5 examples of users losing money due to user error.

If he chooses to monetize the site aggressively (or as you put it, "maximize revenue") in a way that detracts from providing users a merit-based look at the ecosystem, then what will happen is quite simple: Google's ranking of the site's quality will decrease so the site will get pushed further down and buried in the search results, Bitcoin communities (like Reddit, IRC, google plus, facebook, etc.) will gradually learn that bitcoin.com is a commercialized site (and so the site will be vilified in the community), and so on. This has already played out in the community with low-quality news sites like 'cryptocoinnews' and 'newsbtc'.
It will be a vicious cycle that results in the value of bitcoin.com decreasing ever further, and Roger's own reputation suffering. In its place, bitcoin.org will remain the top-ranking go-to site (according to Google, and according to the community) for Bitcoin.
If the above happens though, I don't want to see Roger complaining, or anyone else complain on his behalf that "the community should stick together". It will be the free market at work, finding value and amplifying it above lower-quality alternatives.
Can you agree with that?

Oh, I don't know. Maybe the fact that Bitcoin represents 90% of the cryptocurrency market cap and has all the network effect, while the next highest altcoin has 4% (and 350,000x less mining hashrate). By even this most simplistic definition, Bitcoin is legit and every other altcoin is shit.
What makes me think only bitcoin will succeed? First of all, Bitcoin is already here and wildly dominant. Further, although nothing guarantees it, the fact that sidechains and future improvements (and current solutions) bring over altcoin features to Bitcoin does make altcoins irrelevant. When it comes to 'money', there is no need for another money when a successful one (Bitcoin) already exists and stores billions of dollars of value. Altcoins are simply redundant.

Peter, I was saying this in a positive way though. This is ultimately good for Bitcoin (decentralizing mining further). Ends justify means?
What if miners do it 'anonymously'? That was the keyword in this research. Because it's possible to do it anonymously, it makes sense for all miners to allocate hashrate to do it. And once that occurs, the incentive changes: encouraging mining pools to become smaller entities individually and more defensive.

I don't know much about WoW and have never played it, but Google told me (sourced from Wikipedia, I think):


@_date: 2015-07-19 18:07:41
1. WoW was introduced 21 years ago, vs. Bitcoin 6 years ago. In fact, a more apt comparison is that WoW was introduced in 'official' 'ready for market' form 21 years ago, while Bitcoin was only relatively bug-free (ready for market, although in a still unpolished form) by about 2011. So, it's 21 years vs. 4 years.
2. WoW is just a game, and an addictive game at that. It's easy for it to gain traction. Bitcoin represents a new form of money, with a highly controversial premise that is difficult to grok and easily dismissed by those without a full understanding. See this Andreessen Horowitz podcast:  -- even when I first heard about Bitcoin from a friend, I just frankly ignored him until a year later when he tried again, this time by demoing the tech by actually sending me some bitcoin (lightbulb moment).

Vaultoro looks quite impressive... a lot more impressive than BitGold or BitReserve, since your physical gold is stored with Vaultoro in Swiss vaults, delivery can be requested, it's audited by BDO, they have full bitcoin and gold reserves, and you can instantly trade 2-way between bitcoin and their gold. Further, the founders have been involved in the Bitcoin community for a long time.
However, even Vaultoro gives me doubts, since there is a default 0.5% trading fee each time you convert between bitcoin and gold (it easily adds up with every trade), a 0.4%/year gold storage fee (bitcoin has a 0% storage fee), and requesting delivery comes with its own set of rules and extra fees (smelting fee, and delivery fee) that are not transparently specified:


Basically, when you finally are done adding up all the fees with Vaultoro (which looks like the best bitcoin / gold option I've seen so far), I would imagine it can add up to a lot. Of course, I'm considering it a "lot" because staying with bitcoin is a 0% fee. Also, with bitcoin, one can easily choose to maintain full control over the asset, whereas with Vaultoro undoubtedly the incentive is to let Vaultoro keep control, until some 'crisis' situation occurs where the user fees it is imperative to withdraw the gold and control it himself. Of course, in that situation, the problems of individual gold storage / transportation will manifest.
I guess it's a good idea if you're mainly concerned about reducing impact of Bitcoin volatility, and choosing to do so by having a gold position rather than another asset, while being okay with the risks and added costs I've mentioned above.

False. It is not Senator Smith alone that will make his bitcoins private, it is everyone. When everyone does something, the action is no longer suspicious. Further, every person will still have the ability to keep their transactions public, if they wish, with a public viewkey in the case of Confidential Transactions, or by having transactions on-chain in the case of Lightning and not using any form of CoinJoin. Finally, those who wish to use a private sidechain may do so; those who do not, do not have to. The point is, once a user decides to make pseudonymous bitcoins completely private (obscuring amounts and/or metadata), there is absolutely nothing anyone can do to stop it or reverse it. Furthermore, it will become the norm to some degree with Lightning.


Of course it's true, and it's natural. You have shifted full-time from a bitcoin pumper to a monero pumper. You're quite obsessed, ever since becoming mod of Monero, in finding ways to 'catch up' with Bitcoin.


Proof? I'm one of the least pessimistic (most optimistic, idealistic) people you'll meet. I just don't believe in pumpers driven by self-interest who seek to deceive others, especially with an area like Bitcoin that I care about deeply.

No, the problem is wealth inequality caused by: wealth acquired by lack of merit vs. wealth acquired by merit. The problem is not wealth inequality, itself.
With bitcoin, the money supply can't be subjectively increased, leading to asset bubbles that benefit a small number of already-rich people (who own assets). Also, there is no debt-based currency (fiat), and fractional reserve banking becomes much, much harder since accountability is made easier due to the increased transparency (made possible by cryptographic verification of proof of reserves being done of a cryptocurrency asset, rather than a fiat IOU).

Understood. All I can say is that I pretty much guarantee you will have a better reception in r/bitcoin if you prioritize development of a pure-bitcoin solution, whether that means Tether or something else. The idea among most of the Bitcoin community is that Bitcoin is not simply a currency or asset, but rather a 'protocol' -- the implication is that pretty much everything one could want is possible to implement directly on top of the Bitcoin protocol; no altcoins or other blockchains required. Using altcoins just adds unnecessary complexity and is often simply a way for the altcoin's creator to make money by reinventing Satoshi's Bitcoin wheel and riding the current cryptocurrency wave.
Further, while I can appreciate that NuBits seems to be constantly improving its product and reacting to adverse market situations from earlier this year, the existence of the complementary NuShares, which is unpegged and has declined 80% from its high, sort of muddies the idea that NuButs is just an innocent solution looking to solve volatility in contrast to other altcoins.
Just my personal opinion.

I'm not at all suggesting a mod can't post here. And, I'm aware it's a thankless job; I'm in no way suggesting you're not a good 'mod'.
My concern is that your Bitcoin knowledge seems shaky (it's perfectly possible I misjudged and am wrong). I was under the impression that all r/bitcoin mods were not just chosen for being great mods but, like u/theymos, were also highly knowledgeable about Bitcoin. Maybe my high expectations (and wrong expectations?) are to blame for this reaction. I would not have reacted as I did and written my post, if you were not a mod; I couldn't have cared less if some 'random' had made this thread. But, what did really bug me was that despite being a mod who should be enforcing civil open discussion and silencing trolls who are being provocative, you yourself made a specific provocative statement typical of Buttcoiners: "There is no question that a lot of bitcoiners think of bitcoin as their lottery ticket get rich quick scheme." -- sorry, but if you don't think this is provocative and completely unnecessary, then we'll have to agree to disagree. I think it was inappropriate, given you're a mod.


I can understand the intention was a hypothetical to explore motivations. But, would you really expect honest answers anyway when bitcoiners are asked if all they care about is getting rich? I wouldn't, which is why I see a question posed like this as 'provocative' and useless.
Yes, that's the narrative. But, who cares if that's the narrative? The 'narrative' of anything is usually described by those 'outside the group' who are not involved to the extent of the group's members. People in r/bitcoin are exposed to many different types of information. Their knowledge base concerning Bitcoin is, I'd expect and hope, far far deeper and broader than a typical layperson's. So, obviously the narrative will only see the simplest thing and latch on that (price), just as it happens in the media too, which is mostly obsessed only with Bitcoin's price.
I completely disagree that it is "proven out every single time" though. It's not wise to judge based on a single circumstance. Yes, there is 'euphoria' in the sub when the price rises suddenly. Is that actually unnatural though? I think it's pure biological and human nature. Dopamine is released when something pleasing occurs (price rise) and whenever money is involved. Meanwhile, in the rest of the periods when price is steady or declining, but when non-price news is posted to r/bitcoin, people here are just as interested and curious and open to discussion and even 'euphoric' with extra-good non-price news releases. So, judging the sub as filled with 'get-rich-quickers' doesn't seem fair at all, and frankly just false. Maybe I'm an optimist, but I'd like to think this sub is majority filled with genuine people with good intentions.
By the way, I'm not even getting into the other aspect which is that Bitcoin was **designed** to incentivize (via a token with value -- aka 'bitcoins' with monetary value that can increase) its use and development. Price appreciation is literally part of the game theory of Bitcoin, and partly what allowed it to be bootstrapped in the first place and emerge from 0 cents to 255 dollars now. Nakamoto Institute has lots of insightful material into this trait of Bitcoin btw, in case you want further reading into the theory. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this, despite many peoples' dislike of the price aspect and thinking it somehow 'corrupts' the technology. Some also have disdain of buying bitcoins because of it, but it makes no sense to me, since no one complains about people who buy stocks. Those who bought Apple stock when it was less than $50 and sold now have gotten rich; any complains about them at any point for being corrupt get rich quickers? Literally, the entire stock market is condoned, yet Bitcoin somehow gets flak. Those who want to buy bitcoin purely as an investment, without concern for the technology, are well within their rights to do so, and deserve no hate or mockery from anyone for making that choice. It's rational and has precedent (the stock market, or any investment in a financial asset: bonds, forex, etc.). Maybe, this is the primary reason I took such umbridge with that statement of yours in this thread, and why I also outright dismiss this argument taken by most of r/Buttcoin, including u/jstolfi.


Yes, agreed, but your thread did not concern this. It was not substantive in that respect. I'm sorry if I was a bit harsh, but I've noted your reaction to events has not always been 'measured', but rather a bit emotional and 'jump to conclusion' type? For example, you made a thread expressing confusion and unhappiness at "all the silicon valley and wall street firms getting into bitcoin and taking over" specifically mentioning Blockstream / Nasdaq news, etc. I though that was a pretty superficial analysis of events, and did make a lengthy comment trying to allay your fears, although never really received a response acknowledging what I said.
To end, re:


Not sure what this means. Reddit involves comments, not just voting. Commenting and discussion is in fact far more helpful than mindlessly downvoting something without trying to explain the reason. By explaining myself in that post, I put myself on the line for expressing these opinions. I actually took a risk doing it. The community was free to judge your thread and judge my post, and they did. But back on topic, I don't think downvoting without commenting is appropriate; upvoting without comment is fine, since it's usually self-explanatory, but I think it's helpful to the person being downvoted to receive some written feedback on the reason (unless it's blatantly obvious like with certain r/buttcoin trolls.

If this was actually true and applicable, then Bitcoin would not hold  a 90% share of the cryptocurrency market cap, followed by the next-highest coin having only 3.5% share.
@_date: 2015-07-22 18:35:45
Nope, the research is not saying total mining hashrate will decrease (going from 365 PH currently, to 200 PH in the future). It's saying the share (%) of the hashrate that is held by individual mining pools will shrink, since the incentive will change from encouraging few large open mining pools to instead encouraging many small closed mining pools.
Instead of having the network made of pools with shares of (22%)-(17%)-(17%)-9%-8%-4%-4%-4%-etc. [current status quo --  the network will become more decentralized [example new distribution: (12%-10%)-(8%-9%)-(10%-7%)-9%-8%-4%-4%-4%-etc.]
On the other hand, maybe some of the total hashrate will switch from being used for securing the network (mining blocks) to being used for anon block withholding attacks. I can't imagine it's a large number though (?). Even if it's 5% of total hashrate, we'll move from 365 PH of effective hashrate to 345  PH of effective hashrate, with the benefit gained of a more decentralized mining network.

The latter.
LN whitepaper says 7 billion people can make unlimited transactions with LN only with 133 MB block size. So, ultimately, we need *at least* 133 MB blocks. At the same time, it means 1 MB blocks will serve 50 million people with unlimited transactions. So yeah... the question is to figure out the right balance of "when and how much" block size needs to be increased.
There is a lot of conspiracy theory without facts that Blockstream developers (Adam Back, Maxwell, etc.) are simply biased, when they argue to be careful with block size increase. However, read their posts carefully, and you'll see there do exist issues. This is the only reason I'm saying it is about "when and how much" -- I'm just saying it needs to be done carefully, and honestly, that is all "the evil corrupt Blockstream devs" are saying too.

Not that impressed; it promoted the idea of 'blockchain good, bitcoin bad or boring', and overall from start to finish read more like an advertisement for Ethereum. Even the title of "The Future of the Web Looks a Lot Like Bitcoin" is immediately followed by the sub-heading of "Forget the currency; it’s the protocol behind it that matters."
The article did not seem to recognize, or delve much into, what makes bitcoins special from an economic point of view as a near-perfect form of 'money', since it ran with the idea that 'bitcoin the currency is boring'. This lack of understanding of the core of Bitcoin, and the main motive for its creation by Satoshi, displays to me the author does not actually 'get it'.
Even when looking at how the article discussed the 'blockchain' aspect of Bitcoin, it appeared quite biased. It spent a couple paragraphs mentioning Factom and Blockstream's sidechains as allowing extensibility and innovation in Bitcoin, but as a whole, it spent a lot of words in the beginning, middle, and end detailing Ethereum's ambitions, and directly quoting 'Lubin' of Ethereum as thinking that Bitcoin should leave the blockchain innovation part to Ethereum.

@_date: 2015-07-19 18:44:10
Yes, Bitcoin does not exist in a vacuum, but the market has already valued cryptocurrencies such that:
* Bitcoin holds 90% share of the cryptocurrency market cap.
* The next-highest cryptocurrency has only 3.5% share.
Further, this equilibrium has been more or less maintained for years.
Even further, Blockstream's sidechains tech's raison d'etre is to further enhance and solidify Bitcoin's dominance, and remove the possibility that its current network effect could ever be threatened. Yes, there may be certain altcoins that perform in specific niches that Bitcoin simply cannot be adapted for (even this I'm not convinced of, but maybe it's possible), but the role of 'cryptocurrency as money' (finance) is not up for grabs. Bitcoin dominates that role right now; when combined with sidechains and Lightning, it will maintain its dominance into the foreseeable future.

Great question!
I just tried sending $0.01, but was denied ("amount too small for the bitcoin network"). I then tried $0.02, and received a conditional acceptance ("you can send it, but you need to pay an additional 100 bits to the network to send it"). Finally, I tried $0.03 (107 bits), and the transaction was sent with a 300 bits fee paid by Coinbase.

No, my issue is with the fee (paying the spread via Shapeshift represents a fee to the user). Using Bitreserve, there is 0 fee, but using a Nubits-enabled solution, there is a fee. I didn't even include the 1% escrow fee, so including that boosts the end cost even higher.
I'm not sure how Bitreserve makes money, but they are full reserve and list their reserves transparently on their website ( I think).

I didn't say that Augur would not have a higher volume (nor that it would). I was simply stating the fact that an alternative purely Bitcoin-based project exists (i.e. 'Augur' is not the only prediction market in development, despite its prominent marketing on r/bitcoin), and that Augur is explicitly tied to Ethereum, despite their attempts to pretend (and only when posting on r/Bitcoin) that they would gladly use Bitcoin "if it was practical". The fact that Truthcoin development is proceeding rapidly is proof that a prediction market based on Bitcoin is practical.
See Truthcoin's website, plus their FAQ for lots more information: 
Personally, I think Truthcoin is a superior project, one reason being that it stays true to Bitcoin. Why does that matter? Mainly, principle. Bitcoin is the original, and hence only legitimate, cryptocurrency, legitimacy defined by the market, i.e. its 90% share of the cryptocurrency market cap. Projects that deviate from Bitcoin (altcoins) are not pure at heart, in terms of improving what already exists; rather, their developers feel like they missed the Bitcoin boat and so seek profit by instead attempting to blatantly clone or reinvent the 'wheel' (wheel = Bitcoin). I'm not saying every single altcoin fits this mold, but the vast, vast majority do.
So with Augur and all such altcoin-based projects, I feel there is just some sort of fundamental dishonesty and obfuscation at play. Many Ethereum crowdsale 'investors' bought in because of the promise of Augur, and vice versa.
Still, the blog post was a great explanation of the significance of prediction markets, and obviously I wish both Augur and Truthcoin success.

For such tiny amounts (less than $0.01), why not send bitcoin off-chain through a centralized service (e.g. ChangeTip, etc.), until a better (i.e. decentralized) off-chain solution is developed? That would mean no fees. Sure, it's not ideal, but if we're considering such small amounts of money, the risk would seem to be negligible and it would seem to be an appropriate solution.

@_date: 2015-07-03 07:34:27
Key links:




Voat is an open source and "open moderation" clone of Reddit. This means that structurally, all moderator actions are signed to a log that cannot be altered ( increasing accountability of mods and thus integrity of the community. Discussion of the feature:


*How else does Voat differ from related projects?*
* based in Switzerland, no censorship policy as long as content is legal in Switzerland
* ad revenue-sharing model (in development, we will disclose more details soon) where community is rewarded with real money for quality original content
* realtime chat for every subverse
* realtime notifications for user mentions, post and comment replies
* deterministically scaling voting quota
* limited voting (new users need to gain a certain amount of points before they are able to vote without restrictions)
* user profiles show statistics about user activity: for example, submission distribution and highest-lowest rated submissions and a short biography with avatar
* increased focus on privacy: enables users to delete their account by automatically overwriting every comment and every submission the user has made with a string "deleted", before proceeding to remove the user account from user credentials database.
* responsive design which works great on mobile out of the box
* built-in night mode
* subverse set system similar to the one used on Google News
* markdown toolbar for user friendly text editing
* automatic expando creation for many popular services
* anonymized mode: subverse owners can irreversibly convert their subverse to anonymized mode which hides all usernames and disables all voting actions within that subverse
* limited number of owned/moderated subs per user (10)

Why isn't it useful, though? If I have a limited cellular data plan and so don't want to create a hotspot, and if I'm also traveling, then if I want internet what do I do? Pay exorbitant sums to access established companies' hotspots that are sold only in fixed time allotments, or pay only what I need (say 5 minutes worth or 15 minutes) via a mesh network? The way mesh will become accessible, I can imagine, is when it becomes extremely cheap (micropaying for bandwidth) and flexible to use. I don't think paying with fiat allows that, or does it?

Using bitcoin in the 'true' sense, then, is still simple.
Just add 2 simple steps:
1. Download breadwallet to your iPhone.
2. Send the Coinbase bitcoins to breadwallet.


Yes, that's a big problem.
But, there should be easy widespread consensus to increase to 2 MB blocks by Nov. (see u/jgarzik's recent BIP), which would double the limit to 6 TPS. We are averaging 1.5 TPS (of real demand) these days, so 6 TPS may represent a ceiling that lets us buy enough time until Lightning is ready. Recently, u/rustyreddit proposed a new way to achieve Lightning that, in the inventor's (Poon's) words, will allow Lightning to be deployed "*much* sooner" ( I don't know how to quantify that to a specific timeframe, but it seems like Lightning would be ready before 6 TPS becomes a problem.
Also, to emphasize, Lightning (according to Poon) allows unlimited transactions per user -- i.e. 50,000,000 users for 1MB block size, 100,000,000 for 2MB block size, etc. This is in contrast to simply increasing block size without Lightning, which only increases the number of transactions supported (e.g. 1MB = 250,000 transactions/day at 3 TPS... maybe we can assume 10 transactions/active user/day, which means ~25,000 active users supported with 1MB block size). Thus, we can estimate that Lightning grants a 2,000x scalability improvement.
In reality, when it becomes possible for the network to handle unlimited transactions for a given number of users, then new use cases will become feasible (like microtransactions, e.g. paying 0.1 cents per WSJ article), which would mean Lightning ends up increasing scalability by far more than 2,000x.

An altcoin can be cloned onto a sidechain, and thus used with bitcoin currency (and bitcoin's liquidity and services) instead of being required to use the original altcoin's currency (and paying the conversion fee between bitcoin and the altcoin). This could apply to cloning Ethereum for instance, or to cloning a privacy-focused alt. The idea is to maintain Bitcoin's network effect and consolidate cryptocurrency development.
The other use is to allow safe testing of new and proposed Bitcoin features, before deploying changes to Bitcoin itself.

I was considering posting about the same thing...
Notice the bar graph in the lower left?


It shows a lopsided distribution of transactions, weighted heavily to the left side (values less than 0.0001 BTC). It was the same story during the entire 'stress test'.
In contrast, during normal operation of the network (without spam transactions), the distribution consistently remains a nice bell curve.
It would be cool to give that distribution some sort of numerical value, and then use that to easily identify with high confidence when the network is operating 'normally' vs. when the network is being 'attacked'. If this is a very reliable indicator, perhaps it's even possible to include within the Bitcoin protocol various attack mitigation measures that are enacted only when the indicator is activated.

This is really a horrible title (and article) that doesn't make any sense. ShapeShift exclusively interconverts between bitcoin and altcoins; it has nothing to do with other assets. If anything, ShapeShift is a 'killer app' for altcoins, by allowing altcoins to be used as a method of payment for bitcoin-accepting vendors (without requiring the vendor to specifically accept each altcoin). And sure, ShapeShift *can* also be used as an altcoin trading vehicle to trade small sums, but the conversion fee is much higher than the trading commission charged by dedicated trading websites (e.g. bitfinex, okcoin, poloniex, etc.).

If OpenBazaar takes active steps to discourage 'illicit' activity (definition of illicit is dependent on jurisdiction), then it will simply be forked to allow it. I don't think it's good for OpenBazaar or for security, since it will fragment OB meaning security practices / maintenance of core code may suffer in the fork.
Instead, maybe just accept that 'illict' activity will be a part of it and keep it separate from 'licit' listings, maybe by having separate categories for those types of products?
Or, if you think the problems from the prior paragraph can be resolved, then make the code so that it is easily 'forked' by whoever wants to fork it, and so that security / functionality updates are easily maintained across forks.
The benefit of this is that the main OB app (if there is an app? I've heard OB is a protocol, not really an app, so not sure if my terminology is correct) can have only 'licit' items (so as not to scare off mainstream users), while the forks can carry whatever else.

I can see why people may think it is unfair, but what about when gold first made its appearance / conversion from commodity to money? Whenever that happened, it happened, and that was that. And what about gold's 10x rise in value from $200 to $2,000? Did gold's value to investors suddenly decrease because gold had increased in value, or because gold's supply basically does not increase each year (lack of inflation)? Bitcoin seems to be extremely similar to gold, yet nobody complains that gold supply is not increasing. Instead of complaining, people have been buying. Over time, because of its lack of inflation, gold as an asset has attracted 7+ trillion USD as an "inflation hedge" class of asset.
If bitcoin represents a better gold (digital gold, gold 2.0) due to algorithmically determined 0% inflation in max supply, in addition to all the other various superior attributes, then it would appear bitcoin is destined for a similar fate to that of gold (as an "inflation hedge 2.0").
Furthermore, as we know, bitcoin does not even have 0% inflation yet. It is inflating on a pre-determined schedule, which means newcomers have had (and still do have) plenty of chance to enter while bitcoin is artificially made relatively cheap (due to the increasing supply):


Finally, no one is forcing anyone to buy bitcoin. Thus, it can't be described as "unfair" (I know you didn't explicitly use the word, but it was implied by your post; Ryan Selkis also has implied it). As mentioned, like gold, bitcoin is basically an 'inflation hedge'. People buy into it pre-emptively (to pre-empt fiat inflation), or reactively during times of chaos by compulsion. It is optional; people do so by choice. Obviously if society was being forced into bitcoin from fiat by decree, then it wouldn't be fair for people to convert their fiat at an increasingly inflated rate... but that's not the case.


The interesting thing is I haven't really heard this criticism leveled at bitcoin. Can you name anyone of import? Virtually all entities (individuals, VC funds, hedge funds, investment groups, businesses, developers, etc.) recognize that bitcoin is 'digital gold' and thus that the fixed cap is a feature and asset. Besides Selkis, I can't really think of any significant entity with the audacity to genuinely suggest removing the cap. I think Jon Matonis has mentioned it a few times, but only as a point of discussion on how to address future miner rewards, but never as it being unfair because of inequality.
There may be debates and disagreement in the bitcoin community on how / when to raise block size cap, but I'd venture there is sheer unanimity (I'm defining it as &gt; 99%) in terms of the 21m cap being sacrosanct and untouchable.

* An average 2,000 calorie diet (1 pouch) has 60 g sugar vs. recommended &lt;25 g by the WHO
* Calcium carbonate is source of calcium, which is a very poorly absorbed source with side effects (better is calcium citrate or malate)
* Magnesium oxide is source of magnesium, which is also poorly absorbed and has side effects (better is magnesium citrate)
* dl-alpha-tocopherol acetate is source of vitamin E, which is synthetic and poorly absorbed with side effects (better is d-alpha)
* Palmitate is source of vitamin A, which is synthetic and poor source (better is beta carotene)
* Vitamin D2 is source of vitamin D, which is inactive form of vitamin D, and not recommended (better is vitamin D3)
* Cyanocobalamin is source of vitamin B12, which is synthetic form and poor choice (better is methylcobalamin)
* Sucralose is an artificial sweetener and a poor choice (better is stevia)
* The omega-3:omega-6 ratio is unclear, but given that total polyunsaturated fat is ~20g, it is unlikely that the ratio is any good, which means Soylent has an inflammatory effect.

Yet another silly, inappropriate thread by jratcliff63367, who is, need I remind everyone, an actual mod at r/Bitcoin. It's sad that virtually every thread this guy has created in the last few months has been of the immature, childish, drama-queen, uninformed, hysterical sort. I would expect r/Bitcoin mods to actually understand Bitcoin at a deep and thorough level, yet this is clearly not the case with every mod here.
What is being proposed by this guy demonstrates that he does not understand Bitcoin at all, since the free market value is intrinsic to the way Bitcoin works. Having a set 1% increase in value per annum makes no sense from any perspective, and likely is not even achievable practically. It's a fantasy that could only be advocated in the real world by scams looking to steal money.
Further, this guy finds it fit to insult Bitcoiners in the title and in the post, as if he is separate and better than Bitcoiners, saying, "There is no question that a lot of bitcoiners think of bitcoin as their lottery ticket get rich quick scheme".. wtf? Really? This is the simplification and accusation you're going to level at the members of the sub of which you're a mod?

Is there some critical mass of users needed to vote in the PM to produce accurate predictions? In other words, maybe increasing block size has intended and unintended consequences. How many people need to participate for all these consequences (and, in turn, their consequences and ramifications; the 'butterfly effect' per se) to become priced in to the prediction market? Is it even possible for this PM to price it all in?
Further, what about information asymmetry and mob rule? It seems the PM is almost like a pure democracy. Suppose 4x users are non technical and don't understand fully the consequences of raising block size, while only 1x users understand fully. If 4x are voting in favor of raising size, for example, wouldn't that bias the outcome of the PM towards favoring the majority (incorrect) view, thereby producing invalid results?

Super interesting, I agree, and I'm grateful this is the case. Now I see why your blog post was enthusiastic about this point :). I forgot to consider the monetary component. Anyone can say anything when there is no cost to the statement being right or wrong, thoughtful or thoughtless, but if your vote now comes with a risk of losing money, it would seem to incentivize participation only by those with some degree of confidence, thereby encouraging quality participation.
On the other hand, to have max predictive ability, every person needs to know about the existence of the PM and be able to participate at will. Or, maybe not everyone is required. Do you know of research showing at what level critical mass is achieved?
I guess part of the gamechanger here is basing the PM on a frictionless censorship-free cryptocurrency in general, and more specifically on bitcoin with its 90% dominance of the cryptocurrency market cap and position basically as the reserve currency bridge between fiat and alts. Anyone on the margins, with fiat or with an altcoin, can easily participate in the PM by converting to btc.

I prefer not to go to Monero. I'm even weary of spending more time on this topic, since it is a done deal. We can argue semantics all day, but the end result is not going to change.


Man, I see this argument amongst *all* altcoiners, even Litecoiners! Don't you guys see the issue with this statement? First of all, Monero is not "new" -- it has been on the open market for years already, and yet still has its tiny 5 million USD market cap. Second, back to my original point, all altcoiners see Bitcoin's rise from nothing to worth billions of USD and then without fail think "Oh look! Bitcoin did it, so our [insert altcoin here] will also do it. Bitcoin was nothing at one point, but now look at it!".
What you guys miss is that Bitcoin was a novel idea -- the first cryptocurrency in the market, which is why it appreciated in value as powerfully as it did, attracting all the factors of its network effect in the process like a massive dragnet. Altcoins, by comparison, by and large add nothing truly revolutionary over Bitcoin. This includes Monero, for the reasons I've given in my posts so far; sorry, it's just not significant, and it's further lessened in significance by the fact that Bitcoin already has a degree of privacy (via pseudonymity + coinjoin), and that it is actively further increasing its privacy as time goes on.
Ethereum literally seems like the only possible altcoin with developers (or should I say 1 developer, Vitalik) who have the ambition and the funding and the mindshare that could realistically gain any significant market share, by creating a truly revolutionary product. Even in that case though, there are all kinds of obstacles it faces in its path forward. Unrelated to those obstacles, but even Ethereum does not view its coin (ether) as a true competitor to Bitcoin; those guys, too, defer to Bitcoin as the future currency and store of value.
More on this idea of network effect and kind of a 'juggernaut' characteristic, I'd like to show you something else. Blockstream, a Bitcoin company that raised a couple tens of million USD in funding late last year, specifically has its goal to maintain and enhance Bitcoin's network effect and dominance. This is literally the reason the company was created, lol, and was explicitly stated in the lead investor's public statement (a billionaire with net worth of $4.7 billion in 2015, Hoffman, who personally invested rather than investing as part of some group), who also dropped a line highlighting his respect for the company's co-founder's privacy background (hint hint):

Hi Aaron,
Do you think a dynamic block size (hard cap and/or soft limit) that auto adjusts according to transaction demand would be a good idea, to help keep the network operational and reasonably predictable? It seems something ahould be done to prevent the result being as you described.
One argument against is that it may put pressure on nodes. Is there a solution?
Another argument against is that fee pressure will be eroded away by a dynamic limit, and that this is bad because fee pressure and a fee market needs to develop to assist the transition away from block reward as incentive for miners. However, I'd think this could be addressed by simply including 'average network fee' in the equation that derermines block limits. In other words, it could be designed to keep blocks a size that targets a certain average fee. If average fee exceeds the target (determined beforehand and extrapolated forward to properly address the miner incentive issue -- maybe retarget the average fee to a higher level every halving), then block limit can be increased to reduce fee pressure and hence average fee... and vice versa. Is this viable?
Any other thoughts?

This sparked my memory. I do remember reading this 'Frontier' release of Ethereum (first release, various releases to follow it) includes killswitches and other means for the devs to exert control.






In other words, as you said, this 'Frontier' release is in no way a fully functioning and stable form of Ethereum. It's only a preliminary test release. Whether it can graduate to a mature release is still TBD.

You're an investor? I didn't even know it was possible to invest in breadwallet. How does investing in breadwallet generate a return? It's a free, open-source wallet. I don't understand where revenue would come from.
But yeah, if you as an investor with extra deep knowledge about breadwallet can be confident about them, then that does help increase my own confidence.
Btw, I ran my own test finally. I sent 3700 bits with 19 bits fee, and the first confirmation was in 38 minutes. I can't imagine why it was so fast, especially with the 19 bit fee and considering current network conditions! Just luck? I've seen similar odd reports on Reddit.

To which the answer is, "Yes, storing bitcoins on a smartphone is the right mix of security and convenience and usability and cost".
Highly recommended for ease-of-use and security of funds are: 'Breadwallet' for iPhone, or 'Airbitz' for Android. 'Mycelium' for Android is also popular in r/Bitcoin, but Mycelium may be too feature-heavy and confusing for non-techy new users, so I think Airbitz would do the job much better. Overall though, if you have an iPhone, it should be a clear no-brainer for a new user to go with Breadwallet.

It's good to see Isabella Kaminska at least understands the reason Bitcoin works, and why 'blockchain without bitcoin' is flawed thinking and unviable. It seems her issue with Bitcoin is more along the lines that she thinks Bitcoin is a bad choice for society at large (governments interest -- maybe she thinks money should be inflationary), similar to the view of Yanis Varoufakis; she doesn't seem to understand or value the benefit Bitcoin provides at the individual level. That might mean she has a political ideology that conflicts with Bitcoin (which assumes a more libertarian ideal or Austrian economic system).
I think the misunderstanding of her position is because the BBC video was not in fact talking about Bitcoin's uses throughout the entire video. Rather, it used the word 'blockchain' to mean 'private ledger without bitcoin token'. That's inaccurate since usually 'blockchain' refers to the first and primary and dominant blockchain in existence, Bitcoin's blockchain. So when Isabella was giving her opinion on 'blockchain technology', she was speaking about the problems of a private ledger without token, but did wrongly use the term to exclude the case of Bitcoin (since of course Bitcoin also uses 'blockchain technology').

1. Link is broken.
2. Is this really recommended, in terms of security? Personal computers (laptops, desktops) are notoriously vulnerable to malware and keyloggers.

Yes, but nothing is perfect or magical or Utopian like that, right? Bitcoin is software and programming, and is in an unfinished state and actively being developed. Yes, Bitcoin is super easy and simple to use (providing you choose a user friendly, well-designed wallet), but it's not a mature system yet. It has less than 5,000,000 users, at the highest estimate. What I'm trying to say is that it should be expected that issues will arise, and that users will need to have flexibility, and be open-minded to having to deal with 'early adopter' issues.
If someone wants to actively *use* Bitcoin in a state of perfection, then now is not the right time. If someone is comfortable *using* Bitcoin now and dealing with inevitable issues along the way, then now is fine. If someone is not comfortable, but wants to speculate that Bitcoin will iron out its issues and eventually in 2-5 years will be a smooth, reliable, predictable experience to use, then one can *speculate* by buying and holding bitcoin; for the purpose of speculation, the transaction spam issue is not going to have an adverse effect.

This is probably exactly true. eBay has the users, so they make the rules.
One thing I can think of though, that differentiates OB and gives reason for hope, is that OB does not really need to make a profit. eBay fiat competitors do, and they need higher margins due to fiat. This could mean OB is able to sustainably offer its 0% / low (1%) fees which, when added to the 1% cost of converting fiat to BTC, adds up to 2% fee which may be enough to attract users?
Well, the 1-2% is what a buyer would pay. The seller would pay 1% only to convert BTC back to fiat. Sellers already have the incentive to use OB since they pay much lower fees with OB. Buyers have no incentive because they pay extra 1-2%; so to incentivize buyers, sellers would have to discount their products from regular prices, to share their OB savings with the buyer. Will they? I'd think OB needs to make that dynamic clear to new sellers right from the start.

Yet again today, we have more 'spamming' or whatever, which has increased the transaction backlog to 80,000 now. Breadwallet needs an update released ASAP to allows its users to handle this (current bread defaults to 19 bits, which is woefully inadequate for current conditions), otherwise users will simply leave breadwallet to use a wallet that allows custom fees or auto-fees (i.e. a wallet that can deal with network conditions, either automatically or manually by allowing user to set a custom fee).

Your post had '6 paragraphs' -- the first 3 of which were fluff and meaningless.
Re: your 4th, don't try to flatter Bitcoin, or pigeon-hole it. Who said it will remain a 'public record'? There are all types of efforts, established and underway, designed to obscure that record and make it optionally private. Even the leading scalability proposal, Lightning, has no primary objective of that nature, yet it results in trustlessly shifting most transactions off-chain (hence no longer on the public ledger).
Re: your 5th, I don't "read you" for any reason, much less prognostications of the future (I'm sure we're well aware of your disastrous history on the other investing subs) -- I keep note of all r/bitcoin pumpers / scammers, and you fall into the former category.

I’d argue gold is a store of value, though. And, Bitcoin is best defined as aspirational “digital gold”.

Being allocated gold that may or may not be available during a time of upheaval, or subject to a nation's laws of confiscation or whatever else is created, is in fact an 'IOU'. Buying physical gold and storing it yourself in a manner controlled by you is the only safe way to deal in gold.
Of course, that's what makes bitcoin so superior to gold, in the sense that it's far easier for an individual to secure and transport bitcoins than it is gold. Bitcoin is about eliminating 'trusted third parties' that one is beholden to, while BitGold itself (or these "Brinks vaults") represents a massive trusted third party.
But I digress; this entire thread is essentially 'spam', since it has nothing to do with Bitcoin and everything to do with promoting the centralized service 'BitGold'.

I definitely don't think it's malicious either, but it certainly seems to be motivated by profit, and in this case it's mutually exclusive from what is good for the ecosystem, isn't it?
The way bitcoin.org non-biasedly lays out all the options and then judges each option by the same standards is a system based on merit. I'm very grateful that bitcoin.com keeps the pop-up from bitcoin.org that appears when you click the wallet, but the 'bump' system turns a merit system into a 'who wants to throw more money into advertising' system. It corrupts the system. That money would have much better effect being donated by users to developers to improve the software.
Yes, the community should 'stick together', but only when it is fair and due, right? Every person should be held accountable, regardless of past history. That is the way to encourage each person to act according to high standards, and not get tempted by complacency or baser attributes of human nature. If Bitcoin is to thrive, the community cannot only be motivated by pure profit. Otherwise, we get high numbers of scams and disillusionment among the community.
It's even more disappointing to r/bitcoin, since Roger originally redirected bitcoin.com to bitcoin.org, following the public okcoin/roger 'scandal'. At the time, Roger was hailed for his 'generous' action. But now, 1 month later, r/bitcoin sees that the action was reversed and sees a brand new bitcoin.com. Comparing bitcoin.org and bitcoin.com, it becomes clear that bitcoin.org is a superior and more objective site in every way. Anyway, I hope I was able to explain some of the sentiment around here a little better.
@_date: 2015-07-23 16:33:17
Where are you getting your numbers from?
8*(1.4)^9 = 165.
So, even assuming starting from 8MB blocks within 1 year, then 9 years of 40% increases, we only end up increasing to 165 MB blocks in 10 years. That's a 165x increase, not 1,000x.
Furthermore, with an average of 1.5 TPS (transactions per second) on the network right now with 1 MB blocks, and 86,400 seconds in 1 day, it means 129,600 transactions/day on average. Even if we assume 1 unique person is responsible for each transaction, which is unrealistic but for sake of argument to max out possible users, it means 129,600 people use the network every day. 165 MB blocks would allow usable TPS of 165 * 2.3 = 380 TPS. 380/1.5 = 253. 253 * 129,600 = ~33,000,000.
So, 33 million people will be supported in 10 years from now, and only in the sense that they can make 1 transaction per day. Do you expect in 10 years to increase adoption only to that amount? And, like I said, it's a poor estimate anyway, since 1 transaction/day is not realistic. If we say 10 transactions/day, which seems more fair, then 33,000,000/10 = 3.3 million people would be supported in 10 years.
Feasible? I don't think 3.3 million people supported by the network in 10 years = feasible. This means simply increasing block size will not work to scale Bitcoin. (By the way, this is the first time I'm doing this calculation, and if it's actually true... then I'm terrified.)
Either Lightning works (which enables *unlimited* transactions by users, and every 1 MB of block size = another 35 million users supported), or true scalability will remain a pipe-dream (which basically means Bitcoin is screwed as a payment method, and is relegated to only a digital gold store of value mechanism).

Except, they can't because they don't have the requisite network effect. Just because 'potcoin' exists does not inherently give it any comparable utility. Utility comes from having value, and value comes from the ecosystem (maybe 95% of attention is focused on bitcoin, which means the other 500 or more altcoins are sharing the remaining 5% amongst themselves), and the capital allocated (bitcoin controls 90% of cryptocurrency capital, while the next highest alt has 4%).
Another example to give a sense of scale:  altcoin is Litecoin, a PoW altcoin like Bitcoin. It's mining hashrate = ~250,000 lower than bitcoin's hashrate. Another way to put this is that 99.9996% of global mining hashrate is being used to secure the Bitcoin network, while 0.0004% of hashrate is being used for Litecoin. They are just simply incomparable, in any sense of the word.

There are lots of positions on this issue, as the issue has become highly politicized and a battle between 2 sides with 2 different visions.
* One side is "2MB": this is basically about increasing Bitcoin's capacity for transactions by 2.0x amount, by increasing the current block size from 1MB to 2MB; it requires a hard-fork which safely needs ~12 months to accomplish.
* The other way to increase capacity is by "Segregated Witness": this requires a soft-fork (can be safely deployed in 3 months) that needs wallets to update; it increases capacity by about 1.8x (and any wallet that updates to support Seg-Wit will instantly grant its users higher capacity, without needing all other wallets to also update).

If 40% of global Android devices are vulnerable, then it would suggest Android bitcoin users need to be extremely wary.

Gotcha. However, if Lightning offers all the benefits it is supposed to, I can't see why it's not likely that most traffic will move onto Lightning.
The aim, for the majority of users, would be for their transactions to clear in a trustless, instant, low-cost manner. Whether it settles on-blockchain or off-blockchain would seem to be neither here nor there, right?
Also, I want to point out in direct response to "Lightning requires larger blocks." -- if 133 MB blocks enabled 7 billion people to make unlimited transactions while settling on-blockchain 2x/year, then 1 MB blocks would seem to enable the same for 50 million people. Is this right? I assume this, but I'm not sure if my assumption is valid. If it is valid, then 50 million people represents a very high number, a milestone that I'd expect won't be hit for years.

Your statement is a bit dramatic, I think, no?
While we don't have a truly 'perfect' wallet yet, SPV wallets like breadwallet do exist and provide access to Bitcoin via virtually any internet connection.
Not to harp on about breadwallet (it's just an example), but in all my time on r/bitcoin, I haven't even once seen a case of a breadwallet user losing his/her bitcoins due to a security issue with breadwallet, iPhone, or iOS. This, along with the fact that it is SPV, demonstrates a viable alternative wallet exists to running a full node, for those whose internet connections are not good enough.


Also, with 5MB blocks, if 50% of internet users can potentially run full nodes, then that seems like a pool that is plenty big enough. The Pareto Principle ( or 80/20 rule, is almost a natural law of nature. It says 20% are often responsible for 80% (whether that's productivity, or resources, or effort, etc.). So, going by this natural law which is evidenced in countless examples in the world, even if only 20% of internet users could run full nodes, it would appear to be just fine and probably the most optimal route to choose (when considering benefits of a larger block vs. centralization costs). Not sure what size block matches with that, but I'd love to know!

Thanks, appreciate it, must be a lot of people who do 0 development work on Bitcoin, yet are super enthusiastic in wielding pitchforks on Reddit (by furiously downvoting), rather than engaging me in some rational debate.


Rather, the evidence that contradicts the view that "financial conflict of interest is driving Blockstream's actions" is plentiful. I will try one more time, if not for you then for onlookers, to concisely present whatever arguments are presently coming to mind:
* The only financial-related **proof** available is that financial incentives are aligned for Blockstream employees to work to benefit bitcoin (as mentioned in my prior posts). This is not a financial conflict of interest, but quite the opposite: a financial alignment of interest.
* The lead investor specifically said that benefiting bitcoin is the first objective of the company, as has Adam Back and the others.
* Their main sidechains project is open source and free to fork or copy, or examine and become an expert on, for the purpose of future 'consulting'. Further, anyone can contribute to sidechains openly on GitHub, thus demonstrating expertise and being seen as just as qualified for future entities looking for sidechain consulting.
* The Lightning project (yet another open source, open development project universally lauded by the Bitcoin community) is being solely funded by Blockstream. --&gt; a good samaritan action: funding of core development --&gt; an example of **proof** of their "primary" objective.
* People other than those from Blockstream *also* do not support a contentious hard fork (Wladamir from MIT, Harding, Peter Todd, Garzik who supports market-based miner-voting proposal, etc.).
The problem is you don't seem to respect evidence and proof, but instead believe *unfounded* speculation is enough. In my book, that's called libel / slander, and not constructive.

So, you deposit 100 USD worth of BTC and get back 99 USD worth of NBT. 1 month later, you deposit 99 USD worth of NBT (assuming a perfectly stable peg, which right now does seem stable at $1.00 --  vs. bitUSD which has 7% slippage at $1.07), and get back 98 USD worth of BTC.
Results after 1 month:
* Bitreserve = deposit 100 USD, get back 100 USD
* Nubits = deposit 100 USD, get back 98 USD

Good question; I've forwarded the recent news to u/aaronvoisine on breadwallet's GitHub page ( to get some clarity.
Usually, though, SPV *is* considered superior to having to trust servers in the middle. Also, fwiw, Airbitz is targeting inclusion of SPV once libbitcoin integrates SPV sometime this year (I think Puey said this, earlier this year).

The reason I recommend breadwallet over Circle is that breadwallet also has an extremely simple and attractive UI and UX, as is. Unless you want to buy bitcoins with Circle too, I can't see a reason to use it as the main wallet.
Breadwallet also is SPV connecting to the network directly so it will never go down like Mycelium has, plus it represents a wallet where no transaction can ever be censored, while with Circle that possibility exists. Finally, it is much faster to get started with breadwallet (literally just write down and safeguard the 12 word backup) vs. Circle.
I see no downside at all to using breadwallet. Do you? I do agree it's a horrible idea to recommend any new user to use Electrum, Armory, Bitcoin Core, etc though (because of their unattractive UI).

This is done on purpose to increase user security. It's a form of 2FA, as you noted. With traditional fiat and bank accounts, even if the account is hacked, the money is not easily stolen as the transactions can be reversed by the bank. Bitcoin is different, because transactions can never be reversed. For this reason, security is extra important and essential when dealing with bitcoins.
Smartphone wallets like breadwallet and Airbitz maintain good security and make the process a little simpler. There are also easy to use hardware wallets like Ledger Nano, but they require a secondary device (a laptop or desktop computer) in order to use the bitcoins.

Bitcoin Core is complex to use and the design is not intuitive, as compared to breadwallet (iOS) and Airbitz (Android) which are much easier to use. Further, if you use a non-jailbroken iPhone, using breadwallet is extremely secure (almost no threat of hacking or malware or viruses on iPhone).

There's literally no *safe* alternative, though. If we want to risk the network's integrity, then we can *unsafely* try to deploy a 2MB HF in 1 month, and potentially risk the network splitting because full nodes have not upgraded in time. The safe way to upgrade via HF (and safety seems important with a $6 billion system like Bitcoin) would take far longer (9-12 months) than a comparable SF (like SegWit SF).
Ideally, we would have had productive conversations in 2015 quickly, and moved away from promotion of BIP101/XT for most of that year. If we had, then we could have scheduled a safe 2MB HF from, say, Q1-2015 to Q1-2016 (12 months).
Instead, while Core insisted BIP101 was unsafe, Gavin and Hearn insisted BIP101 was tested and safe (and tried to force the issue with XT). It took until end-of-2015 for Toomim to do real research and poll the miners, and for the community as a whole to accept that BIP101 was dead-on-arrival.


The priority confirmation is a consequence of how SegWit works, as SegWit saves space with each transaction.


Do you mean non-updated wallets would fall in priority? Why would we be crushed in May?

So what? Read the explanatory post, instead of looking at a trivial date. Garzik clearly explains why "Bitcoin as a settlement system" is the *only* logical path for Bitcoin's layer 1 (and in fact how/why Bitcoin is a settlement system *by design*, and requires a "layer 2" to scale by any significant amount), if you want to retain Bitcoin's properties as a decentralized cryptocurrency.


But, if I'm replying about the more petty/trivial (IMO) argument of "dates":
*"Bitcoin itself cannot scale to have every single financial transaction in the world be broadcast to everyone and included in the block chain. There needs to be a secondary level of payment systems which is lighter weight and more efficient.*"

Hi Paul, thanks for the additional details. I'm not familiar with libbitcoin much, although Vitalik seemed to have high praise for it 2 years ago --  --, and Amir Taaki gave a very nice interview on the subject too --  --, but do you think it's feasible to even host a full node wallet based on libbitcoin on iPhone? From what I understand, a full node (with pruning) would be even better than SPV. If network data load is high with a full node, then maybe it's possible to channel the majority of the data load when wifi is accessed, and leave the rest (the bare minimum) for cellular data. I know there are inefficiencies in being able to accomplish it on a smartphone, but I'm wondering if libbitcoin is also more efficient in this respect, as you say it is with SPV, to be able to allow that.
@_date: 2015-07-20 02:46:52
Hmm, good point. The CEO of Airbitz says SPV is coming to Airbitz this year probably, and that it will be much faster than the current SPV, since Airbitz is based on libbitcoin (which will implement SPV more efficiently)... so keep an eye out for that.

I think you're being unreasonably harsh. I just watched the trailer again, specifically to evaluate your concerns, and: 1) It did not feel like it was too long at 3 minutes. The time just flew by., 2) The 'epic' music did not in any way feel overdone. It was not even the same soundtrack throughout the trailer, but rather it changed once or twice and felt appropriate. It did not feel gimmicky at any point. I mean, the topic is "end of money" and "will bitcoin eventually change the nature of money" or "cause macroeconomic shocks" that the "federal reserve and other agencies are concerned about"... the subject matter was in tune with the semi-epic music, so it felt harmonious.
On the other hand, I feel like the stock footage was a little overdone in its quantity. It was obviously stock and a little low-quality at times (e.g. footage of knights or middle ages), which was a bit distracting. Overall though, that was luckily only a minor portion, and I'm optimistic that when seen in context of the whole movie, that there will be a good balance of content and footage.

I don't see how it's "reasonable" (cc: u/chakra_scientist). What Classic wants is a 2MB HF... and SegWit either integrated with the HF, or put forward as a HF later. This is what Sanchez has proposed here (SegWit + 2MB HF). Thus, it's not a compromise, even if it's presented as one.
It's Sanchez' opinion that SegWit is better packaged as a HF, but that analysis of the tradeoffs is not widely shared at all (which is why Core's roadmap has it as a SF). The small benefit to making it a HF is outweighed, IMO, by the increased deployment time needed for a HF vs. a SF. A SF could be deployed by ~May 2016 (~3 months), while a HF would need 9-12 months to be safely deployed.
Recognition of this aspect seems to have been missed, as Sanchez says (emphasis mine): "A 2 MB increase in the block size gives **immediate** breathing room for transaction capacity".
The real 'compromise' would be to move forward with the logical option (SegWit as a SF deployed safely in ~3 months), and also include on the roadmap a 2MB HF (along with other essential HF wishlist items to fix misc. bugs, etc.) scheduled for deployment 9-12 months into the future.
This way, SegWit would provide ~80% increase in capacity in the short-term (or 60% increase with the most conservative measure), while the 2MB HF would provide a further 100% increase in capacity in the medium-term (12 months).

Core's long-term goal:
* Scale based on technology's progress (IBLT, weak blocks, etc.)
* Bi-directional payment channel tech implementations (LN, etc.)
Classic's short-term goal:
* 2MB HF = 2x capacity increase
Classic's long-term goal:
* Non-existent (unless you consider an amorphous proposal to poll the community's wishes via consider.it to be a legitimate proposal)

Wallet progress is well under way, as you can see from here:

The only wallets missing from the list so far are the heavily-funded, VC-backed, centralized, hosted wallets (blockchain.info, Coinbase, Circle, Xapo, etc.). The reasons why they are missing should not be too hard to figure out, given the highly politicized climate.

Except, it couldn't be used to make such an argument because Bitcoin represents the first cryptocurrecy (and still completely dominant, 6 yrs later), and hence the first form of money exponentially superior to any preceding it. Further, its importance is signified by the fact that it went from nothing to 4+ billion USD.
And, as much as you can try to deny it, Bitcoin's overwhelimg network effect, owing to being first, can and will continue as its weaker points (complete anonymity and privacy) are rectified via existing tech integrated more tightly into wallets (CoinJoin and JoinMarket), new tech optimized and integrated into the protocol itself (CT), and altcoin tech (like cryptonote, but especially zerocash) cloned into a sidechain when sidechains are ready... thus backing an altcoin with the bitcoin reserve currency (and hence with all its network effects).
I despise having to repeat myself about this, but DAH's CTO thinks the CT tech in its 1st form, in alpha, .. ALONE .. goes "99% of the way" towards making BTC transactions private enough for a Wall St. financial firm to use. I pretty much have to say nothing else at all, and this one example of a real life situation speaks for itself and proves correct everything I've said (in terms of Bitcoin's supremacy, now and into the future, and the redundancy of altcoins, especially privacy focused altcoins).
Well, that and also the perfectly running illegal DNM's that somehow keep growing in size, despite only currently relying on Bitcoin's pseudonymity! This alone proves the point that further privacy tech is already not a high priority and not even practically needed. But like I said, worry not because of course it's still coming directly to Bitcoin, for the extra paranoid.

If this fee of 30-40 cents happened before Lightning arrived (FYI: Liquid is not relevant, since Liquid is a private sidechain only for use between institutions like Bitcoin exchanges), then I think it would be highly inappropriate and jarring to the network. If it happened once Lightning arrived, then maybe okay.

Fact 4: Lightning (along with proportionally scaling block size) is the sustainable solution to Bitcoin scalability (enabling unlimited transactions by 7 billion users with 133 MB block size).
Please read the updated whitepaper at  if you haven't yet, to really understand its potential.
While block sizes probably do need to be increased in the short-term to handle possible usage spikes, as well as making attacks on the network more expensive (hence less likely), the increase should also be conducted in accordance with Lightning's ETA.

It seems like this press release is for an altcoin that is namedropping 'Bitcoin' and 'sidechain', in order to try to piggyback on it. Key to this conclusion is that the main website mentions Bitcoin only once, that too only in a marketing statement ("IOC works from the PoS system ‘Proof of Stake’ using less energy than Bitcoin, which in turn, makes us more environmentally friendly to our planet.").


The altcoin itself (IOC) has been public for 1 year, with a market cap of $400,000 and 24-hr volume of $1,800.

If you have a moment, would you mind detailing exactly what this means, or linking me to a resource that does that? I've heard this enough number of times now, but I never understand what is being implied.
For instance, "secure" makes me think of "invulnerability to having bitcoins stolen / hacked" -- but Core runs on a general computer (all major operating systems), and I thought storing bitcoins on such a device leaves one vulnerable to hacking... and so that storing bitcoins on a secure smartphone (like iOS), or a hardware wallet, is recommended instead.
Or, take the term "private access" -- what does that mean? It makes me think of stealth addresses, Tor, no address reuse, the OBPP ( 'confidential transactions', CoinJoin, etc. ... so, basically, nothing that necessarily has to do with running a full node wallet.

* re: "fiduciary duty to provide a return" -- It has been stated numerous times, both by Blockstream founders/employees and by investors (i.e. Reid Hoffman in  that return on investment is a **secondary** objective, while improving Bitcoin is the primary objective (exemplified by open source sidechains, and even further exemplified by funding open-source Lightning -- Lightning being the  scalability solution for Bitcoin available right now). That you willfully ignore and justify whatever does not suit your views, while providing absolutely no concrete supporting proof for your view, is no one's problem.
* "Many ppl around here besides me think they are stalling" is NOT an argument. What matters is *why* they think that, which is what I am endlessly asking for: **proof**. Instead of proof, I get "I think and others think it, which means the pessimism is warranted" -- wtf..
* As for "accusing" Brian Forde, I did no such thing; I said an argument *could be* made, and that it would be just as ridiculous as the idea that Blockstream's incentives are not aligned with bitcoin's (for the reasons I gave in the prior post, which you conveniently did not acknowledge).
* Whether or not you took it from a legal website has no bearing on the matter; the point is that no representative from Blockstream who has opined on the debate is in a role of the manner noted (role of having a fiduciary duty, where conflict of interest is innately present). *That* is the relevance of it... and I explicitly described this aspect in my prior post. When you say "having taken that definition from a legal website don't be surprised the named examples don't fit the Blockstream example exactly" -- it's quite dishonest, implying that I was only arguing based on a technicality.
Anyway, it's quite clear you have no intention of changing your already formed opinion. You will keep arguing, just for the sake of arguing, and willfully bending the facts, cherrypicking, and ignoring counter-arguments to suit your view. If not, why did you blatantly ignore the parts of my post that do not support your theory?

How is a system that rewards the rich (seems to be what you're enacting) better than a system that rewards merit (what bitcoin.org currently is: clearly listing without bias the various pros and cons of different wallets)? I'm not understanding the benefits at all. Why not continue, as before, to redirect to bitcoin.org and let the public's most visible website (bitcoin,com) show the most objective information, to allow the ecosystem to grow in a healthy manner?
Your system appears to be a 'pay-to-play' system, where the well-funded company can easily buy its way to the top while the poor startup with better technology remains stuck at the bottom. Why not a merit-based system? For such a visible site that is directing lay people to services in the ecosystem, it does not feel like a responsible system at all.
e.g. There are so many wallets far superior to blockchain.info, yet blockchain.info remains the most 'popular' simply due to its highly visible name. It's quite a sick result... on Reddit, the experienced are well aware that blockchain.info is horrible, yet this does not get communicated to the masses. Your system would seem to simply perpetuate these kinds of bad outcomes, rewarding bad companies (like blockchain.info), while letting good companies languish.
Also, where does the money that's donated for 'bumping' ultimately go? Will it just forever sit in that address?
If you can explain what you're thinking in a clearer way, and what the benefits are over the current bitcoin.org system (besides the difference that this system will be very profitable for you individually, while bitcoin.org's system provides its admins no profit yet profits the greater ecosystem by providing a good public service), then I'm open to listening and changing my mind.

Technology learning and improvement of the protocol directly or its capabilities indirectly (layer 2) is in fact directly correlated with a longterm increasing price. And, development has been occuring proportionally.
Altcoins "destroyed all trust"? Yes, this must be why the market has given Bitcoin 90% of the cryptocurrency market cap, with the next highest contender (literally an inferior clone of Bitcoin) with 3.5%. /s

A few things:
* Mycelium for iOS is completely separate in codebase from Mycelium for Android. They're quite incomparable. The iOS version has had issues in the past. Breadwallet, in comparison, has pretty much never had issues reported with it, indicating better quality assurance testing.
* Mycelium has been suffering network issues lately; so, Airbitz would probably be a better option for Android.

Really, where do you get "most people" from? Honestly, someone would have to be incredibly stupid and 'weak hand' to sell at $1,000, if it actually got back up there.
Maybe I give bitcoiners too much credit, but what I see mostly are targets of minimum $5,000, average $10,000, and fewer targets all the way to $50,000, $100,000, or $1,000,000. And even at a level of $5,000, that is valuation of $100 billion! If it reached that level, there's almost no reason not to just hold bitcoin, since it would mean bitcoin has 'succeeded' and would be considered a 'safe' asset at that point.

Why not send them to user friendly bitcoin wallets, like breadwallet (iOS) or Bitcoin Wallet (Android) .. or even Airbitz (Android)?
These options have been around for years, have *never* had a reported security incident, and (in the case of breadwallet and Airbitz) have modern, clear, easy-to-use user interfaces that do not look like they were designed in the 1990s. Further, there is no censorship with either wallet (which is possible with Coinbase or Circle), so these wallets allow the user full freedom to spend their bitcoins however they desire.
Paper wallets should not be advertised to new users, or even to experienced users. In lieu, hardware wallets (like Ledger Nano for $40, or Ledger HW.1 for $15) would be a much better recommendation.

What is this? The constant referral to Blockstream "conflict-of-interest" is really unwarranted. Listen, if you want to argue facts, please argue facts. But, bringing up baseless accusations (without proof) of actual conflict of interest is not a fair way to argue. Do you want to make correct conclusions, or are you pushing an agenda regardless of how the facts stand?
Before you continue to hurt your own credibility in this matter or any other, I urge you to carefully read the following **public statement by the lead investor** of Blockstream's $21 million funding round, which **specifically addresses the company's objectives regarding return on their investment in Blockstream**:

Just my opinion, of course, but Breadwallet has everything you listed (except 'multiple wallets') and also has advantages: SPV, being chief among them (directly connects to Bitcoin network without having trusted third party servers, which can be a security hole). Also, especially for the layperson (like an escort in this case, or the escort's customers), Breadwallet's user interface is exceptionally simple and clear, while Mycelium's interface is a lot more 'busy' and thus less easy to use.

Sad. I was actually beginning to respect you a little more for having this drawn out debate with me, and was going to comment on it, but now you make a post like this one! :\ Back to the pumper -styled fluff pieces filled with buzzwords and empty meaning. You not only ignored various arguments I made (and I made a LOT of arguments in that last post), but oddly, you ended your post with an absolutely ridiculous, baseless, over-the-top prediction: "Monero isn't going to be the next litecoin... It's going to be as big as bitcoin itself."
I guess I'll comment on the arguments from your post.
You're picking a bone with the "99%" quote by Kfir, and making a usually right argument that 99% is not the same as 100%. So yeah, this is usually right, but you're taking the quote out of context. What Kfir also said was this: "very powerful way to protect investors from having to disclose sensitive business information, even while providing complete transparency to regulators" -- this indicates he is appraising the technology as being viable, full stop. Whatever the extra 1% represents in his mind is implicitly addressable by either further maturity of CT, or by something else to be used in conjunction with it.


Actually, it's debatable, which is why the market values Dash with a $20 million market cap (4x Monero) and has done so for quite a while. Still, these amounts are negligible rounding errors anyway. The market is not concerned either way.


You're putting words into my mouth. I didn't say the world doesn't want privacy. I said what Bitcoin already provides (pseudoanonymity + artifical tumblers + CJ) is already enough to satisfy most of the various users, and that the corps. with extreme demands for privacy (e.g. Wall St., DAH) are satisfied with upcoming tech, one of which is CT.


There is no sunk cost fallacy here. The evidence I've provided in my posts bears out the theory I've described. I'm not ignoring a better future alternative by ignoring failures of the past. As far as the present situation and past situation goes, Bitcoin has been an unmitigated success vis-a-vis altcoins. There is no sunk cost that I'm pining after.
BTW, sunk cost fallacy is not even necessarily real. See the following study from 2007:

I understand the concern, but:
1. They still have another 3 months to become ready. SegWit SF will not be deployed for at least 3 months.
2. The "WIP" notation is actually misleading, as it is not up-to-date. I know that for a fact, upon skimming which wallets are currently listed as "WIP".
3. I agree users need to update their wallets to the new versions, when those new versions that are compatible with SegWit are released. However, I don't see that process taking too long? Remember, there should be a lot of media interest around SegWit's launch (because it concerns scaling Bitcoin's capacity). Everyone in the Bitcoin community is also very aware by now about the scaling debate. Updating most wallets (from the user's POV) is a very simple process.
Further, wallets and users both have multiple incentives to update:
1. SegWit results in lower tx fees (~50% lower).
2. SegWit results in faster confirmation of transactions (SegWit txs have higher priority vs. non-SegWit txs).
Also, don't forget when the VC-backed wallets update to SegWit (which they will; they won't hold out forever, since that would be shooting themselves in the foot, due to the 2 aforementioned incentives), then all their users' txs will automatically and instantly become SegWit txs.
Another thing to keep in mind is, regardless of how it may appear in my framing to you, I don't think "SegWit SF" is perfect. The "2MB HF" is not perfect, either. Nothing is perfect. What matters, really, is what is *relatively* better after considering all tradeoffs. From that angle, I think it's indisputable that "SegWit SF" can be *safely* deployed faster than the alternative.
In summary: Yes, the deployment will be staggered rather than immediate, but I think it's reasonable to expect the deployment to occur reasonably quickly.

That's a good point in general, but you're trying to generalize the discussion now simply to justify what was a prior false comment -- "Your phone is equally at risk". By any objective measurement, as I showed, this doesn't apply to iPhone, but it does apply to Android.
In the real world, we already have put security issues to the test. Breadwallet, an iOS wallet, has NEVER had a security issue that resulted in stolen bitcoins. So, no need for any of this -- "You can always import signed transactions you created on an air-gapped machine with Armory or Electrum on Windows. This is only necessary for larger amounts of course".
P.S. The text message thing was not really as you described. It concerned sending a specific string of characters, which then caused the phone to restart. Not ideal, but also nothing dangerous, and it was fixed by Apple in a point update.

How is it actually a "bump" though? If you increase the fee from ~2.5 cents (0.0001 BTC) to even just 5 cents (0.0002 BTC), then transactions will be confirmed in a more timely manner. Nothing is actually broken here. Yes, most wallets and users are unprepared and this is an unexpected event, but the solution is simple.
Disclaimer - I'm not saying the current situation does not make for a bad end user experience; it obviously does. Wallets are not capable across the board of automatically handling this situation and, even if they were, I don't even expect users to be happy that their $10 transaction, which normally takes a 1 cent or 2 cent fee, now is suddenly asking for a 5 cent fee. What the *best* solution(s) is that will resolve this problem, I can't say. The purpose of my post was simply that the problem is not catastrophic, nor something that can't be fairly easily bypassed.

You're not "lying" and neither is u/guy_tell. You're both just giving your view.
Back to the view, I'm not really an expert on this (I rely on my memory)... but my view is that soft-forks (innately opt-in) require "rough consensus" (doesn't have to be a super super majority), while hard-forks (mandatory) require near-unanimous consensus (so not necessarily numerically by a vote, but instead based on a lack of meaningful technical objections).
Wladimir's role in the process is to gauge when consensus is reached, yes, but he is not the be-all / end-all. If he merges something, another person can revert it... and vice versa. Wladimir exists to make the process smoother and give some order to it.

u/AaronVanWirdum is one of the *best* journalists in Bitcoin. I recognized this, ever since he was able to write an article that clearly explained a complex research paper for a lay audience (I know, because I went looking for the source paper to find more info, but realized the original article had already done a good job hitting most key points of the paper), and I remember being really impressed. He has continued, since then, to seek to understand issues, gather facts, and clearly present them in well-written articles (while many other journalists in the space just regurgitate).
If you don't understand the issues or agree with them, then that's your problem. It's telling that you had nothing specific to say about any issues reported. Don't try to shift blame onto someone else, and that too in an obviously hypocritical manner, and to a respected journalist. When an article doesn't advocate a position you like, it is *not* time to demonize the journalist. (And, by extension, when miners don't decide in favor of your position, it is *not* time to demonize the miners.) -- It's amusing how when the reverse is the case, suddenly all is right with the world &amp; it's time to sing and dance in the rain.

If that sentence was thought/made in isolation, then I'd agree it's unhelpful. But, I thought/made 3 sentences after that. Isn't the rest of the response true, and valid? I agree people need to "come together", but it can't be about mindlessly compromising. Do we want to maintain Bitcoin's integrity, or do we want to compromise that integrity away, one compromise at a time?
I'd also argue that Core *is* offering something re: capacity increases. I don't know if you read my other messages on this thread, but Core's SegWit SF will provide ~80% increase in capacity in ~3 months. So, I don't understand the controversy. If Core was offering no increase, then that would be a different story.

Loads of reasons. I did a lot of research on the VPN providers 6 months ago, although I don't remember everything I found. Some things off the top of my head regarding cryptostorm:
* their team is very technical and very visible, which is evident from the information on their website, their presence on IRC chat, and their numerous discussions on Twitter and interactions with the rest of the security community -- this is important to me, since it means the team behind the VPN is competent. VPN is not just about privacy, but about security, so a team that is competent and constantly involved with the latest events in the security world is key.
* their VPN offers custom leak protection of identifying information
* open source (
* by simply connecting to their VPN, you can also access .bit (namecoin) domains, as well as .onion Tor domains -- as well as apparently .i2p soon
* speeds are reliable, consistent, and fast
* ability to customize which form of encryption to use
* privacy when paying with bitcoins (anonymous, hashed, token-based network access -- 
Again, I'm sure there was more, but this is a brief highlight. Go through their website and you'll find mountains of information, as opposed to the 1 page summary found with most other VPNs.

Ah, thanks for clarifying. But would this unified HF attempt include Core's requirements for a safe HF, i.e. minimum 95% of hashrate + sufficient time of 9-12 months for planning/scheduling the HF?


Well, I guess my prior question's answer is found here. I have to disagree. A quantity of time in that ballpark is needed for a safe HF, even if Core was backing the effort. Core's backing would not automatically translate into dramatically reducing that time.


Not exactly; or if it's a guess, it's an educated guess:
* "According to some calculations performed by Anthony Towns, a block filled with standard single-signature P2PKH transactions would be about 1.6MB and a block filled with 2-of-2 multisignature transactions would be about 2.0MB."






I don't understand this argument, really. SegWit gives a ~1.8x capacity increase. Whether this is the "primary" benefit, or if this is one benefit of many (as is the case with SegWit), it still delivers the increase. So, I'm not sure what the purpose is of making a distinction here. The 2MB HF delivers a 2x increase, and that's it.


Sure, but it also takes much longer to roll out a HF safely than a SF. There are trade-offs involved in comparing the 2 options. Personally, I think 80% increase in 3 months is better than waiting 12 months for a 100% increase.


Specifically, he suggested it 6 months ago. When he did, it was before the revelation that SegWit could be implemented as a SF. Furthermore, Adam is one person in Core. He was not speaking for Core, although at the time (before SegWit SF's existence, and with the knowledge available), his position was certainly reasonable.

What I am trying to say is that, yes, Maxwell overreacted and missed a few facts (that Peter did not create the thread on Reddit, that he was innocently making some theories on bitcointalk), but can't we be more understanding for *why* Maxwell may have been weak at that point and gotten irritated? We're all only human. We should be allowed moments of weakness, no? The reason being: he does code review for Core and critiques a lot of new proposals, including altcoin proposals, and sees many innocently incorrect or blatantly scam ideas thrown around.
So yes, he incorrectly assumed motivations in this example, but when someone is inundated with such stuff, it becomes difficult to assume the best of every new proposal. So there was a reason for the behavior. And, he even apologized for what he called his "offensive" tone.

Do you know what side chains are, or what they would do?
Side chains are either:
* private/closed (like Liquid - grant profit to Blockstream - for exchanges to use between each other to transfer funds instantly to increase overall market liquidity)
* public/open (like RootStock or Hivemind - do not grant profit to Blockstream - anyone can interact with it).
In both cases, Bitcoin capacity is irrelevant to side chains.
Not to mention, Core's short-term scaling plan is Segregated Witness SF, which increases capacity ~1.8x. That's only 10% less than Classic's 2MB HF plan, while also having the benefit of being a more safely &amp; quickly deployable soft-fork.

Right, as you said, the 12-word backup with HD wallets (e.g. breadwallet, mycelium) makes the point moot. However, now that I think about it, it's still inconvenient if it means the user must wait until he/she can buy a replacement phone. So, it's still not a 'perfect' wallet.

Yes, this was just a communication issue that is not limited to her or to BBC. We should probably standardize on saying 'blockchain' as a general term for 'permissionless' ledgers (like Bitcoin's), 'Bitcoin' or 'Bitcoin's blockchain' to refer specifically to Bitcoin, and 'private chain' to refer to the blockchain-without-token 'permissioned' ledger concept
Even 'private' chain is tricky, since a blockchain can be a public ledger or a private ledger depending on level of anonymity. So maybe just stick to permissioned ledger vs. permissionless ledger, or even more clearly... **'closed' ledger vs. 'open' ledger**.

SegWit won't be available, even hypothetically, until May 2016, so wallet developers have a solid 3 months left to update to be ready. SegWit SF is also opt-in by nature, since it's a SF, so there is no hard deadline for wallets to be ready by. They will be compatible with SegWit and non-SegWit transactions, either way. Their timeline will only determine whether they personally have an advantage (lower transaction fee + priority confirmation of transactions by miners) over their competition that has not upgraded, or not.

He is either trolling, or he is part of a minority of people with highly extreme positions (specifically mircea popescu and co. who think no one but rich should use Bitcoin). It's a parody of the truth, of course, which is that the network's security and health comes first. If this means fees must be 5 cents or 10 cents in the short-term, in order for Bitcoin to maintain its security via hashrate incentive, then so be it. The alternative is that security is weakened too much, in this hypothetical example.

It wasn't a 'huge' post, but okay. Takes literally 1 minute to read.
Repeatedly stating that "there is simply conflict of interest at stake here" does not make the conflict of interest magically appear. Provide proof, or don't make unsubstantiated allegations. I actually provided proof to the contrary, in the form of the lead investor's explicit public statement. If you can't provide proof supporting your view, then your view is heresay and speculation (and hence worth nothing).
And, if you think your reputation should be built on making unproven criticisms, then by all means keep on following that tack. Personally, I'm not going to allow my credibility to suffer by following such a path. Only facts and proof matters.
Do you not care about the principles behind Bitcoin?

"Wanting" something does not make it a valid position to hold. The position needs to be backed up by facts and evidence. It may be true that the other side wants things like 20MB or 8MB or BIP101 (8MB * 1.4/year), but as we saw from Toomim's census of consensus of miners, most miners will not support anything more than 2x in 2016. The same goes for the technical community (Core devs), since more than 2x in 2016 is not safe for the network to handle.

**Falsity 


Adam Back (President of VC-backed company, just like the other dozens of VC-backed companies in Bitcoin btw), Cory Fields, Matt Corallo, Luke Jr, Peter Todd, and Johnson Lau *all* negotiated with... not a "handful of Chinese miners", but with: Antpool, F2Pool, BW, BTCC, BitFury, Haobtc, LightingMiner, Huobi, OKCoin.
**Falsity 


Well, when members of Core (the dev team that represents 90%+ of the technical community) + ~90% of hashrate agree on something, then yes, that's typically known as a rough "consensus". The rest of Core still would need to come to consensus, but this is a nice start.


Also, this involves the largest Bitcoin USD exchange by volume (BitFinex). You may want to note the recently released Bitcoin Roundtable letter, for more of the parties making "consensus", since you are hugely underestimating who is involved:


**Falsity 


Gavin is "Chief Scientist" *not* of Bitcoin, but of the virtually bankrupt Bitcoin Foundation. He is also an Advisor to Coinbase, and holds equity in Coinbase (conflict of interest). Furthermore, Gavin's contributions to Bitcoin's code in the last few years has been minimal. He's still an important figure, in the sense that he also has a degree of expertise with Bitcoin, as does Garzik.
However, they are 2 people only. As previously mentioned, 90% of Bitcoin's technical community is aligned on Core's roadmap. Gavin + Garzik certainly do not trump the others.
**Falsity 


Antpool was part of negotiations. Slush has 7% hashrate (and plans to make it selectable by their miners which fork they want to support -- so they are neutral miner); the other 90% of hashrate participated.
**Falsity 


You imply these are not on Core's side. Let me correct that for you.
Nodes: 80% are with Core


Early adopters (rich users): They are overwhelmingly in favor of Core, by one of the only measurements known.


Exchanges: Largest USD exchange (Bitfinex), largest CNY exchange (OKCoin) are all part of the negotiations. Further, Bitfinex is BitGo's largest customer, and hence by default controls BitGo's decision (and BitGo powers most other exchanges).
**Falsity 


a) Blockstream isn't "taking control" of anything. This is the typical FUD seen elsewhere non-stop for 1.5 years, despite obvious contrary evidence / logic. Bitcoin Core is an openly/publicly developed open-source software, with developers from many different organizations, not just Blockstream. You insult them all by implying they are all part of Blockstream.


b) Their plan is to profit from *sidechains*, which have *zero* to do with Bitcoin as a settlement layer that has restricted layer 1 scaling. You should probably learn what you're talking about, so you don't conflate these two concepts. Liquid is an example of a private sidechain they're selling to market exchanges to increase inter-exchange liquidity.




c) LN is the single best hope for massive Bitcoin scaling. LN is a decentralized layer 2 for Bitcoin, and is not owned by anyone... not the least Blockstream. Blockstream *donates* the services of 1 employee to further LN. LN itself is being developed by at least 2 other teams, composing maybe 10 other people.


d) As mentioned in (b), their products have nothing to do with Bitcoin scaling. Further, they are restricting TPS capacity according to technical constraints. These constraints have been discussed innumerable times on r/bitcoin, if you ever cared to read and do some studying. There have been all manner of podcasts, papers, interviews, etc. discussing Bitcoin's technical matters on scaling. If you spent as much time studying, as you did getting "outraged", you might have learned something by now.
@_date: 2016-02-07 09:56:43


The fundamental issue is that the block chain has these properties of being secure (cannot be hacked) and immutable (cannot be erased), due to the fact that it's based on a globally decentralized network that cannot be regulated (allows for regulation arbitrage) and that is driven by incentives (market driven miner fee that helps encourage miners to devote hashrate to securing the network).
This all falls apart if the network continues to become more centralized (i.e. more vulnerable to regulation). What encourages that? Making full nodes significantly more expensive to run... and increasing miners' cost to propagate blocks. This happens if bandwidth and CPU requirements increase too quickly. Due to the Great Firewall of China, this is already partially the case, which is why miners tend to use SPV mining (outsource validation of blocks to others) and the Relay Network.
The block chain is just inefficient like that... that's why Lightning as a layer 2 has so much potential, as it is not constrained in the same way.
What will increase bandwidth/CPU demand? Increasing demand for the block chain's use, via higher transaction count. Currently, it's hard capped at 1MB, but lifting that cap too quickly means hardware requirements will increase at an unsustainable rate.
Because the block chain is finite, it basically cannot handle being written to at the rate, or for the purpose, of which entities would like to for non-monetary purposes (like your suggestion). Well, they can, but they should be prepared to pay the market rate (miner fee) that is appropropriate to maintain the network's health (and prioritize transactions).
So, it cannot be "low-cost" forever on layer 1 of the block chain. If it does, then that means Bitcoin's other desirable properties will likely suffer. So, it's completely counter-productive.

Fortunately, "for the long-term success of Bitcoin." I was posting in response to you describing Szabo's view as "worthless," by trying to say that what you think about Szabo holds no weight, as Szabo commands a massive amount of respect among the Bitcoin intelligentsia.
How is Szabo capitalizing on anything? He was simply stating his opinion that Mike Hearn's views are not characteristic of most Bitcoin devs, in response to Chris Dixon posting about his interview with Hearn. I am the one who chose to highlight and publicize his post, not him.
I thought this was a pretty important thing to let r/Bitcoin know about since it's Szabo, and especially since there has been a vocal minority on Reddit that promotes conspiracy theories re: Blockstream devs, i.e. that they want to 'cripple' Bitcoin with small blocks for financial gain. Szabo's post emphatically proves that theory wrong. I think it's important that baseless conspiracy theories are eradicated, since those ideas only pollute the waters and make debate of difficult issues even more difficult.

Wow, thanks for the info and Maxwell's link; looks like I have a lot of reading to do.
How would you say this compares to Dash (I think they use some form of CoinJoin), and cryptonote (BCN, XMR, etc.)? I know there was talk earlier, when sidechains Elements Alpha was released, that CoinJoin could be combined with Confidential Transactions to provide Bitcoin with very good privacy. Even Confidential Transactions alone was said to go 95% of the way towards achieving the goal.
Of course, I think the pseudonymous aspect of Bitcoin is perfectly viable for most people's needs... so, additional privacy is of secondary importance (for most people). But still, the more privacy the better (as a secondary objective).

I ran the numbers on a random date (23rd of each month, from Dec. 2017 to Nov. 2018), and it averages ~$9,750. That’s 57% down vs. 78.5% down. The difference? Ending with $43,000 (or $41,000, even if you bought in Dec. at the high of $19,500 instead of $14,300 on Dec. 23) vs. $21,500.
So, DCA leads to ending with 2x more than no DCA. Huge. You’d be a 2x smaller “fool”.
Also, since when is an investment done over an arbitrary timeline of 1 year? An investment that is down over a year makes the investor look like a “fool”? Maybe to a noob. No one can predict timeline of an investment, so any investment is properly done with “longterm” expectations. 1 year is not longterm.
And, only a noob will invest more than they can afford to lose (or go full degenerate by taking a loan, or using leverage). If you don’t do that, then even if a particular investment goes &amp; stays sour over the longterm, it doesn’t materially affect your net worth... and so who cares? Still not a “fool”, even in the worst outcome.
There is always risk with reward. No pain, no gain.

Dollar cost averaging (DCA) would resolve that conundrum nicely.
For example, if one wants to invest $100,000 into Bitcoin, then aim to break up the investing period into pieces. Instead of investing the entire $100,000 in a lump sum (in a single go), invest once a month over 12 months (as an example). The spikes in price happen relatively quickly, so this strategy helps avoid “buying the top”, and rather leads to a cost basis that is biased towards the bottom (where there is sideways consolidation for a relatively longer period of time).

1. Right, but then why adopt bech32, why not instead the more compatible form of segwit that can be enabled by default? I wonder if it is really worth it to go this route, if I’m right and there will be very small adoption of the feature due to lack of awareness plus being opt-in.
2. Oh, I see, makes sense since BitPay is very biased and always trying to find a way to promote BCH. Why not use a different feed then? Currency exchange rate API can’t be something that’s so exclusive; surely there’s a more impartial (thus higher quality) source for data. As it is, users on BRD cannot see their total holdings using BTC as display currency (but can use BCH to do it)... which seems a bit absurd.

1. Why no segwit by default, why opt-in? Most won’t have any awareness to go searching in settings to enable it; most are lay users, not technical minded enough to know about ‘segwit’. Hence, option of segwit, as implemented by BRD (in contrast with other companies), is practically pointless.
2. Furthermore, bias of BRD wallet is further apparent because of lack of BTC option for display currency (only BCH is shown in settings).
Thus, BRD should be boycotted by the Bitcoin community.

What people have chosen to pay dictates a semblance of what is required to make it into a block, so I disagree. People might pay more than they should, but it doesn’t change that this is the fee market’s reality. Yes you can pay 1 sat/byte fees at times when blocks aren’t full, but this isn’t a reliable way to ensure a transaction is processed relatively quickly. Btw, I’m not saying the fees are too high; the median fees are under control, I’m arguing. $0.10-1.00 is a fine range of fees in low-high demand environments to make reliable transactions on the gold standard of cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin).

What about bandwidth? Current 0.5 MB blocksize average takes up ~200 GB bandwidth/month as various posts by users running full nodes (as well as BitFury's own report) have shown. An 8MB blocksize means ~1,600 GB/month in bandwidth. All major North American ISPs have caps on residential bandwidth of about 300-500 GB. By implication, # of Bitcoin nodes will inevitably drop drastically if cap is increased to 8MB in the short-term (next 1 year).

The LN paper currently discusses block size in terms of "making 2 channels a year" (what does 'making' mean, anyway? opening and closing?), for which it says 133 MB block size is good. Are you suggesting 2 channels is not ideal? If so, what is a better number? Is it correct that being able to easily 'make' channels is a good thing, since it means greater flexibility for the user and less chances of hub monopolies? It's an important question as it would affect the estimated size of blocks needed. The current 133 MB estimate may be misleading.

No, 2 soft-forks.
More details, from: 








1. A soft-fork is required, to protect against malleability and to allow new signature modes.
2. A new peer-to-peer protocol needs to be designed for the lightning network, including routing.
3. Blame and rating systems are needed for lightning network nodes.  You don’t have to trust them, but it sucks if they go down as your money is probably stuck until the timeout.
4. More refinements (eg. relative OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY) to simplify and tighten timeout times.
5. Wallets need to learn to use this, with UI handling of things like timeouts and fallbacks to the bitcoin network (sorry, your transaction failed, you’ll get your money back in N days).
6. You need to be online every 40 days to check that an old HTLC hasn’t leaked, which will require some alternate solution for occasional users (shut down channel, have some third party, etc).
7. A server implementation needs to be written.


*Side note*:
It would be nice if there was a team of engineers specifically devoted to implementing this in the shortest possible amount of time, since it's so fundamental.  It does seem it should be Bitcoin's top priority right now.
Maybe Blockstream and/or 21, as they have a lot of resources and this would seem to be part of their mandates? And/Or a Lighthouse project to organize/fund it, but that might be inadequate.

3) Rapidly increase bitcoin adoption among people in poorer parts of the world, which lack:
a) reliable/affordable internet access (since bitSIM works entirely over SMS), and/or
b) secure smartphones (since bitSIM acts as a "fully encrypted Bitcoin Wallet") -- not counting the cheapest Androids that may be proliferating there, but may lack security features or not be upgradeable for security updates in a timely manner, or at all, and thus may be unsuitable for securing bitcoins.

I think you should read my original post much more carefully. I've addressed much of your listed concerns in the hyperlinks I included.
* CT does [not]( need a hard fork.
* Stealth/ECDH may not have consensus, but I mentioned immediately after 'reusable payment codes' -- that does have consensus.
* "Banks themselves have little incentive to add more privacy to the system" -- this is speculation, and false. DAH (Blythe Masters' firm) is on record saying they welcome Confidential Transactions and similar privacy measures, and in fact require it to keep their business txs private. Jeff Garzik has also commented publicly before that the main reservations businesses have with Bitcoin is that it's not private. Again, CT will go a long way for that.
* CT is kind of 'version 1'. In my post, I mentioned "Compact" CT, which requires 5-10x less overhead.
* CoinJoin may require communication and coordination, but did you see what I linked? JoinMarket does *not* require coordination of such sort. It further provides incentives that result in wide availability of liquidity and very low fees. It's very convenient, and more so once wallet integration is complete (currently, Core and Electrum are being worked on).
* "produces outputs which are readily detectable" -- this doesn't make much sense, see: "CoinJoin transactions work today, and they've worked since the first day of Bitcoin. They are indistinguishable from normal transactions and thus cannot be blocked or inhibited except to the extent that any other Bitcoin transaction could be blocked" (
* re: Merge Avoidance -- maybe you didn't read my post carefully at all, yet again? I specifically mentioned (and cited) that Breadwallet (one of the most popular iOS wallets) is working on integrating merge avoidance into its wallet.
All in all, I'm confused? You made 7 points, and virtually every single point is wrong :/. Not only that, many of your points were already addressed in my post... or don't make sense when considering the facts on the ground.

Yes, it is a misunderstanding. Both Lightning and Sidechains are Bitcoin-centric.
* Lightning aims to sustainably (meaning it maintains decentralization) increase scaling capacity by multiple orders of magnitude (1,000-10,000x).
* Sidechains aim to solidify Bitcoin as the absolute dominant cryptocurrency protocol (along with other things, like allowing testing of new features), by allowing virtually any other altcoin to be built on top of Bitcoin *and requiring use of bitcoin currency instead of altcoin currency*. This means the reason to use altcoins disappears, reinforcing Bitcoin's dominance and incentivizing the end of reputation-damaging altcoin pump 'n dumps as well as incentivizing altcoin developers to focus their efforts on a bitcoin-centric world (instead of trying to reinvent the wheel for glory or riches).
I think the root problem for most people who are antagonistic towards sidechains or Lightning is, simply, ignorance. These are both fairly complicated ideas, and it's often the case that people don't bother to invest the time and effort needed to understand them (technically, or even from a high level).
It's a huge pity. People are lazy as fuck.

At present, based on a quick glance, the lack of open-source means people have to trust you and accept your 'patented security measure' is robust and that you won't steal their money at some point.

I did not include Bitcoin Core in my comparison; Bitcoin Core is actually a desktop wallet, and desktop operating systems are inherently less secure (and harder to truly make secure) than mobile operating systems, like iOS 8, that exist on hardware-encrypted devices with a 'secure element' security chip, like iPhone.
Regarding blockchain.info, that "one flawed update" alone is enough for me to permanently remove it from consideration (along with the numerous bugs that have emerged over the past couple years with the web version of the service, and along with the stagnation in its development), since we are dealing here with an app to secure money.
What it comes down to is that there are clearly better choices in iOS wallets, so I can't bother to mess around with wallets that: are buggy, have stagnating development, and have relatively poor security.

Why do you say that? I'd replace 'block size debate' with 'scalability debate', and I do think it matters. The expanded market is not going to be able to transact with a good experience, if average TPS rises above 2.3. If the increased demand causes higher-than-2.3 TPS as the norm, then transactions will take longer than 1 block to be confirmed (1 block being the minimum for a decent amount of security).


I'd say fungibility is equally important to scalability, but point taken. Did you see this recent thread on the topic? Lots of great discussion:

I want to answer what you said earlier, since I forgot to:


To answer this specifically, there are all kinds of theories for how this may play out, though nothing is guaranteed of course. One idea is we just have to develop the protocol and maintain the network in a healthy state, so that when the tipping point occurs in the global financial system (some sort of crash, pandemonium, greek redux?), then bitcoin will exist as an escape valve ready to consume value. Another idea is that bitcoin just requires time to allow compound growth to work. If it grows every year by 50%, then even if we are starting with only 100,000 people, we will eventually reach higher number of users (e.g. it takes 5.5 years to go from 100,000 to 1,000,000 with 50% growth/year).


No, what would they do? Investors would lose access to a source of easy profits, so they'd seek for return elsewhere. I understand the PR boost and media mention increases, but what makes "buying bitcoin" the logical outcome? People could simply say "blockchain is great, long live blockchain" and entirely skip over the idea of buying bitcoin (since that is another debate: bitcoin vs. fiat). On the other hand, it could indirectly help the network tech mature and become more secure, if other entities rely on blockchain to process transactions and thus put resources towards the network to help.
Let me know if I'm missing anything of your thoughts.

*re: "Just consider how the community view and usage is slowly changing wrt the privacy &amp; fungibility aspects"*
In what way is the view changing? The issue in debate is level of decentralization vs. capacity to scale. That's certainly a problem, but Lightning should solve it (situation of 'have your cake, and eat it too'). Also, there is increasing consensus among Core devs for a short-term block size increase to allow development of Lightning, and have a chance to observe ecosystem impacts. Everything I've seen with how people think of privacy and fungibility is intact, in that people still respect it and are working on a scalable solution.
*re: dirty coins*
* "Just from the blockchain, nobody would be able to say that -you- specifically got some bitcoins from someone who did illegal stuff. Instead, you are just one of the possible recipients of those bitcoins." (plausible deniability)
* "When you use JoinMarket to mix you are probably mixing with investors of bitcoins who would own them anyway and have put them into the JoinMarket bot to earn an income from them. This project provides a much larger anonymity set because it convinces normal bitcoin investors, many of whom bought coins from fully-regulated exchanges, to mix with you. All other projects mix your unprivate dirty coins with other people's unprivate dirty coins." (JoinMarket works differently from every other type of mixer, as a result of its incentives system -- rather than 2 parties with 'dirty' coins looking to mix among themselves, you have 1 party with 'dirty' coins and 1 party simply looking to make some profit with his 'clean' coins)
*re: "Otherwise, there wouldn't be any work by the "Core devs" to rectify anything, as you said"*
JoinMarket obfuscates the transaction graph. It does not do anything about hiding address balances or transaction amounts, which can be resolved with Compact Confidential Transactions.

Yup... I think the primary reason is because most communication occurs via text (Reddit, Twitter, mailing list, IRC, etc.). It's too easy for people to simply ignore arguments for arbitrary reasons (misunderstanding, not enough time to care, not enough inclination to care, affects reputation by being proven wrong, politically untenable because of a rowdy and charged up 'base', forgetting to follow-up, and the reasons can go on and on...)

Hi u/maaku7, out of curiosity, can you discuss the various suggestions made by the author? What makes sense, what does not make sense, and why. On the surface, the article looks very well thought out and brings expertise (and citations!) from a pre-existing global network (Google), so I'm very interested in seeing a fleshed-out response by a Bitcoin expert.
@_date: 2015-04-25 22:41:14
It was supposed to be 3 weeks ago (first week of April), as that would represent 2 months after Blockstream's main developer announced "1-2 months left". We are now pushing 3 weeks later than the upper end of that given range.
It's interesting, however, how you notice people in the industry (i.e. reps from Coinbase and 21) speaking about sidechains as if they already exist in the wild.
@_date: 2015-04-15 18:14:14
I suspect the real reason true anonymity is unlikely to be added to the core Bitcoin protocol (and why developers tend to advocate adding privacy "on top") is that it is politically untenable. Governments and regulators would clamp down hard on Bitcoin's ecosystem (via more taxes, more onerous regulations, propaganda, social engineering, hacking... the full disruption playbook, basically) in an effort to actively smother it, if bitcoins were to suddenly become untraceable.
Imagine the prior cases of AndreasA testifying to the Canadian/Australian governments regarding Bitcoin. Then, imagine how the conversation would have changed if bitcoin transactions inherently could not be traced (by default, by nature of the system). Yeah, instant relegation of Bitcoin to the black market and away from mainstream use.
Some reasons privacy-focused alts are being left alone may include: that they are currently extremely insignificant (i.e. XMR is 600x smaller), and wanting to avoid the Streisand effect (which would inevitably increase their tiny size to a more reasonable size) followed by the ensuing Snowball effect (which would build on that increased size, and further encourage their adoption).

Hi u/sqrt7744, don't you think you are being a little ridiculous? Sure, criticisms have been made about Hearn and Gavin, but they have also been made (and with far, far, far, far, far worse tone) against Core devs on the 'other side'. The devs are endlessly accused of Blockstream corruption (a baseless assertion), personal attacks have been launched, and their contributions (that have made Bitcoin what it is in the last 6 years, mind you) are endlessly maligned. Apparently, Peter Wuille (one of the most prolific Bitcoin developers) has drastically reduced his work on Core lately because of depression over what's been going on, and overall there has been a chill in the air. To frame this situation as if only one side is suffering is more than a little unfair and tone-deaf...
We have extreme people on both sides who suffer from lack of any respect whatsoever, no basic manners or sense of decency of how to talk in public, and an inability to either do research and/or comprehend complex technologies... thus resorting to infantile outbursts of anger, and attacks based on emotion (and often without evidence). There is no sense of how to disagree without being disagreeable.
Only one of hundreds of examples of verbal abuse aimed at a dev, in this case u/adam3us, this time by u/tsontar:


It would be nice, u/sqrt7744, if you could speak up against abuse (and offer your support) to hard-working people on BOTH sides of this debate. This includes even if you are not on the side of debate of Core devs, especially then, as surely in your extensive training as a medical doctor you have learned your obligation to help those in need regardless of the reason. I'm currently training, but my parents are both doctors as are most people on my mom's side, and this obligation has always been made quite clear to me.

Next, the 'length' of the blocksize debate is not a bad thing. It's a complex topic with various tradeoffs for each solution. Having that debate in the open and extensively discussing each aspect is actually a good thing in the end. Further, blocksize debate is incomparable to privacy debate, in level of contentiousness.
Finally, I'm sick of hearing Monero owners with a vested interest mentioning Monero on r/bitcoin and constantly trying to pump it every time privacy discussion comes up. It's just so disingenuous and misleading. Monero is frankly incomparable to Bitcoin, as it's just not in the same league (of development). Theoretically, cryptonote offers benefits for privacy, but practically, Monero is not ready. I discussed this more, here:

Interesting points. If it’s not necessarily bad for the network, is it also not bad for the 58% of nodes individually? Do they suffer at all? Also, what’s the point of recommending people to run their own full node, if it apparently makes no difference whether they’re running vulnerable code?

As for iOS compromised by Apple/NSA, please provide evidence. It seems in bad form for someone as technical as you to be making what seem like really, really conspiracy-style arguments. I've literally never heard a single person on r/bitcoin or any other bitcoin developer make this argument...

Great! So, u/nullc and u/Mixlez, if the optimized CT transaction (CCT) is twice as large as a regular bitcoin transaction, then if implemented by default, perhaps average block size would double? It also means miner fee (calculated in satoshis/byte) would double. So practically, people would be paying a 2x larger miner fee and block size would need to be raised at a 2x accelerated schedule (vs. the increase if not considering CCT). In return, all address balances would be hidden. It sounds like a decent tradeoff. Is it good enough?

Uh... did you even bother to do basic due diligence (skim my post history) before making such a judgement? Of course not. People like you are just interested in talking a big talk and acting immune from the state, while not actually doing anything to expand Bitcoin mass adoption beyond a tiny anti-state niche. And *that* was exactly my problem with you and your video.
I love Bitcoin (admittedly my prior post was harshly worded, but to try to make a point), but I also understand the world we live in and how 95% or more of people would be completely repulsed by such a video introduction. People already freely associate Bitcoin with drugs and money laundering. Bill Gates and Elon Musk (two people 3846184x more successful than you) understand the importance of public perception, and have both now cited public perception as a reason why Bitcoin is doomed to 'illegal' or 'less than legal' transactions only and why Bitcoin will not achieve mass adoption. So sure, why not now throw some anarchist fears into the mix too! You have a masterful tactical mind.

Disagree. Scalability has very obvious tradeoffs, in terms of which approach is taken. There is lots of room to debate in terms of wanting to scale slowly or quickly, with lots of pros and cons on each side. Improving the privacy of bitcoin transactions, on the other hand, is a fairly uncontroversial topic... so no need for 'outrage'. It's also highly in demand by businesses who would otherwise begin using bitcoin. Furthermore, not every approach requires protocol changes; some just require wallet integration of the tech.

From Gyft's website (their goal as a company):






And from this article, note his primary motivation:




So, what does this mean? It seems like Gyft is trying to help the entire gift card industry migrate over to storing gift card value directly on the blockchain using bitcoins (without the consumer knowing it -- maybe he will hedge the used bitcoins, to keep the value stable), while ditching plastic cards in the process. Gyft will develop the open-source ecosystem to allow this to happen.
What is in it for Gyft? Why migrate from their current digital plastic-free process to bitcoins? I guess gift cards are essentially like debit cards, except locked to specific retailers. So, I guess the same advantages would apply, as currently accrued by consumers switching from credit/debit cards to bitcoins. Those advantages? Perhaps: faster settlement, faster transactions, avoiding transaction fees, more flexibility of how the value is stored and utilized and tracked and secured, greater efficiencies, etc.
P.S. The CEO of Gyft shared this exact Memeburn article, in a tweet to Xapo's CEO, in response to Xapo's announcement on signing up Taringa.

**PART 2**






I've read it and been following along carefully with u/josephpoon's Lightning Network. I can imagine the work items are huge, and the work involved is strenuous. However, if we will cite Rusty's (u/rustyreddit) summary of LN requirements, and considering he is the lead developer in charge of bringing it to fruition, then we must acknowledge he has some authority on it, right?
Rusty's last line in that link is:


I think it's also helpful to consider Rusty's bio (hence credibility):


Moreover, Blockstream chose to divert some of its investor capital pre-destined for sidechain tech, instead to funding Lightning and Rusty full-time. This is yet another vote of confidence.
Further, referencing u/adam3us's recent interview on a16z, Adam stated (I think) 4 other companies are also working on implementing Lightning (one example:  There is apparent collaboration, too.
Finally, Rusty recently had a breakthrough that helps Lightning be deployable more easily and quickly (in the short-term) than previously envisioned:


Honestly, please devote some time to carefully reading and understanding Lightning v1, Rusty's improvement, and the updated Lightning v2 whitepaper ( If u/gavinandresen has not devoted adequate time to it, please urge him to do so also. If this can work, it really offers true scalability potential (without resorting to potentially turning Bitcoin into PayPal 2.0, down the line).
Please, in the interest of understanding, also take a look at this most recent blog post by Rusty (no direct link available for some odd reason, but it is currently the top-most post) -- it seems to aim to clarify the present situation:






Again, my belief, which may contrast with yours, is that the UI/UX work comes at the end. It's not fair to judge it when it's at its beginning, and pessimistically paint a picture. Since we're dealing with software and moreover cryptocurrency not fiat, this is all inherently interoperable. Check out shapeshift.io -- Look how easily it allows cryptocurrencies to be converted back and forth (albeit with conversion fee).
You mentioned earlier:


We can ask the experts in charge of developing sidechains, but I don't think this is how it will work at all. Since the currency remains 'bitcoin', whether on the main chain or the side chain, there is no 'cross-chain trader' required and certainly no 'fees' for conversion. As I mentioned in the shapeshift.io example, presumably funds can easily be converted back and forth. Clearly there needs to be wallet integration for both side chains and Lightning, but why the worry? The UI/UX work to integrate it smoothly will come in due time. Let's not be concerned so prematurely :).




Yes, some people on the side of Core are truly of the 'extreme' side, whether by arrogance (comfort being in Core), or misguided thought. I've experienced it anonymously, in the form of midnightmagic (on IRC), or by seeing some of Luke's really extreme positions that are untenable with being practical. However, people like Adam Back, Greg Maxwell, etc. can't be painted with a broad brush like that. They have nuanced, reasoned positions.
They do not say Bitcoin cannot scale, just that the rate of scaling will have repercussions WRT decentralization. This goes back to the 'priorities' argument I made earlier in this post at the beginning (do we want Bitcoin to be 'digital gold 2.0' or 'PayPal 2.0?). So, if rate of scaling should ideally be confined, then what? Luckily, things like Lightning offer the potential to scale by a factor of 1,000-10,000x, while still maintaining the network's digital gold-like properties.
I'm asking you directly: do you care if Bitcoin miners or node operators get regulated with AML/KYC and thus Bitcoin becomes PayPal 2.0 (the same way companies like Circle and Coinbase, and likely Bitpay, etc. must perform AML/KYC), or will you be happy to see Bitcoin maintain resistance by staying decentralized and thus have no capital controls and truly be digital gold 2.0? It sounds contrived or cheesy to keep mentioning these terms like 'digital gold 2.0 vs. PayPal 2.0', but it's actually a great way to simplify the debate.
*re: the BIP 101 letter*
*Bitpay* -- Good, but recently, a different executive came out saying the company also supports BIP100.
*KNCMiner* -- They came out after, saying they support BIP100 as well.
*Blockchain.info* -- They may be successful, but have shown repeatedly they're incompetent vs. their competitors.
*Xapo* -- CEO is great, but wallet software has been buggy in my experience.
*BitGo* -- Controversial wrt patenting multi-sig and iffy defence of it, but good services overall and helping to secure other companies with multisig.
*Circle* -- Fantastic UI/UX work, no complaints.
*itBit* -- Achieved an impressive trust charter allowing national operation, no complaints.
*Bitnet* -- Innovative merchant checkout tools, refunds, etc., no complaints.
*Coinbase* -- Did not sign; their co-founders have also seemed knowledgeable and in-touch with what matters in Bitcoin.
*BitFury* -- Did not sign; again, their management, along with Richard Branson, is very much in-touch with Bitcoin.
*Blockstream* -- Did not sign.
*Blocktrail* -- Did not sign.
*TradeBlock* -- Did not sign.

I wasn't concerned about fees, per se.
It was more about the massive volume of bitcoins that are circulating on Chinese exchanges, theoretically giving those exchanges (due to influence from the government) license to "freeze" or "get hacked" or outright abscond with those bitcoins, if it was in their national interest (aka... if the bitcoin price skyrockets and becomes really valuable, etc.) to do so.

It's unfortunate, but inevitable. There will always be extremists lurking in each group.
Looking at the bright side though, enemies of bitcoin in general who have malicious intent will eventually try to use the same attack methods in the future. In that way, the DDoS and transaction spam attacks can be seen as a way of testing and hardening the system's resilience early on. Already, the spam attacks have resulted in many wallets incorporating dynamic fees which effectively deal with that threat, as well as accelerating the priority of protocol scalability measures (block size increases, lightning network, etc.). As far as mitigating DDoS, I'm not sure what the solution is, but there must be one for that too.

People paged in this post: u/drwasho, u/muneebali, u/adam3us, u/rustyreddit, u/josephpoon
**re: PayPal 2.0 stuff**
I fully realize this is their talking points (more respectful way of saying it would be: their argument), but I'm not simply parroting; I'm saying it because I agree. There are many non-Blockstream actors who have made essentially the same argument.
Did you see BitFury's report? You cite "back of the envelope calculations" which surely has its place, but BitFury did substantial data analysis and found CPU / disk storage is the least of one's concerns, as those increase by Moore's Law. Instead, the issue is primarily RAM and bandwidth / data caps. What is your response to that, or ideally data that disproves it?
Even Muneeb Ali said the same here:






Do you have data to disprove it?
Instead of "PayPal 2.0", we can switch the idea to "Visa 2.0" then (1,000x or higher increase). My point wasn't even about technically reaching 100x scalability though, because as cited just now, even 100x scalability is not that simple. Your argument was based on CPU and disk storage, but that has never been the concern of the other side. Even now, others supporting their argument have noted that is not the bottleneck.
**re: Data / Testing in the block size debate**
You said:




See this by u/muneebali:


u/drwasho apparently shared this information with you, and you replied with what is a fair reply. Washington shared it with Muneeb, who then replied to Washington essentially saying, and I quote:




Now, I'm not saying it's your fault that Washington apparently decided to drop out of the conversation at that point, and maybe he did not relay Muneeb's reply back to you? Either way, I checked out the Google Discussion thread, and as of 10 days ago, Gavin had said he did do testing earlier (simulation testing?), but was open to the idea of testing on PlanetLab... but that one needs to know what questions to answer first:


But now that we see the imperative nature of using PlanetLab:
1. Can we agree that Gavin's testing was highly inadequate, and that we *need* data-driven decisions a la PlanetLab?
2. Can mutually-agreed upon, comprehensive testing be set up via PlanetLab, so as to back up the proposals with state of the art testing, and potentially end this debate once and for all?
**re: Lightning as a complex system, feasibility concerns**
I appreciate you have experience with these mass projects at Google, and I can't really argue against a lot of this. But, why don't we ask the two main experts in the field for their thoughts on the matter? u/rustyreddit and u/josephpoon
You said:


Actually, I agree. And, Blockstream has not really been saying Lightning can replace block size increases. As mentioned elsewhere in my post, u/adam3us has proposed a short-term size increase (2-4-8, in '16-'18-'20), to allow time for Lightning development, so as to fairly evaluate Lightning's progress before committing to an aggressive plan.
Different yet similar note, for the record, Gavin spoke positively about doing work on sidechains:


**re: Relevance of Lightning to the wider ecosystem / lack of necessity of the system**
You said:


You previously indicated that Blockstream working on and funding Lightning is a waste of time and not relevant to Bitcoin, nor considered "core infrastructure". You expressed unhappiness time was being spent in that manner.
But, Gavin contradicted this when he said: 


Lightning is cited by Gavin as "absolutely necessary"; this means it's not pie in the sky, Blockstream-centric idea without relevance for the rest of the ecosystem. 
**re: Block size increases as a tested, easy to perform change**


More to the point, Gavin said scheduling an increase is a short-term ugly fix.
Yet XT and BIP 101 schedule a long-term, decades-long block increase, with the implication that it is not 'ugly' at all, but perfectly feasible.
You said:


Along that line, you've indicated this is the reason why Lightning is just not needed... that 100x scalability is not a big deal, and that scaling via block size is tested and easy. Why the discrepancy?
**re: Blockstream stonewalling block size increase**


I agree there was a lot of lethargy and a paucity of proposals earlier, but much has changed.
Adam Back said he was okay with 2MB 2016, 4MB 2018, 8MB 2020. More to the point, he has explicitly said he would support the BIP at the upcoming conference that is best supported by data, no matter which BIP it was, even if it was BIP 101.
**re: The indecorous nature of debate**


Isn't this unfair? This subtle "us vs. them" dialogue -- "these are guys who claim to be experts in Bitcoin scalability" -- is not helpful, especially when plenty of scaling work of a non-block size increase type has been done in the last couple years. The same can be said, in reverse, with certain dialogue from u/adam3us. Let's all back off from assuming the worst, and just find solutions supported by the best data, while remaining open-minded to new ideas *and* practical?

The 'Compact' variant was ~2x larger than standard txs. Sadly, it was found to be flawed and breakable. Efforts may be ongoing to 'fix' it. Back to the original CT, Maxwell is investigating ways to optimize it.
@_date: 2015-09-07 17:07:34


To be clear, the only reason "nobody gives a shit" (or 'gave' since I'm responding 3 days later) is that miners were filtering the spam txs out. Last time there was a spam attack and transactions were only minimally filtered, people were certainly annoyed and there was lots of confusion in the ecosystem.


This is highly unreasonable analysis, since literal spam txs designed to flood the network and without any purpose cannot be called equivalent to legitimate txs (including those of satoshidice, as you theorized). Miners can perhaps be justified in filtering spam designed to cripple the network, but they could never be justified in filtering legitimate txs.
As such, the only options left are: a) let fees rise endlessly as demand exceeds supply, or b) increase block size at a sensible rate to keep up with increases in demand. 
Option (a) is not sensible since it results in a bad user experience at some point which would lead to growth stalling. Option (b) represents a compromise by increasing supply to keep up with demand.
The only reason I cared to post is that I want to make it clear... there is sensible discussion, then there are extreme positions. You make plenty of sensible points (I agree a lot), but this series of posts IMO represents an extreme / impractical / tone-deaf position that is not appropriate for such a large $3.5 billion system. It's fine for a tiny hobby project, such as when Bitcoin only constituted $10 million in assets.

Again, what is being "trialed" is not what the system should be using as a metric. Even Gavin only proposed a system that increases block size by 41%/year to 8GB in 20 years. This is completely opposed to your projection of 30GB blocks in 5-10 years. This dichotomy alone suggests your view is highly irregular and implausible (i.e. extreme). Plus, even Gavin has shown he may be willing to compromise to a 2-4-8MB system over 4 yrs.


Seeing what I said above, your assumption is not based in reality.

Is this remaining weakness resolved by r/JoinMarket's implementation of CoinJoin? There is even a wallet plugin in the works, to help make it more seamless. I'm not sure if JoinMarket can somehow even be incorporated by default into the protocol, though I imagine not.
The remaining issue then with CT is the size (10x larger than current tx size). Is this too big, or is it workable? Is there room to optimize it?
@_date: 2015-09-28 01:39:15


By 'sum', do you rather mean 'net'?
In other words, if a user conducted 3 LN txs in between opening the LN channel and closing the LN channel (let's say: user starts with 100,000 bits, spends 10,000, then spends 20,000, then spends 30,000 -- ends with 40,000 bits after the 3 txs), then upon closing the transaction, the only thing to appear on the blockchain is the bitcoin balance going from 100,000 bits to 40,000 bits? This way, the activity of the 3 txs is not recorded on the blockchain, rather only the net result of the 3 txs (starting with 100,000, ending with 40,000).

Um... sorry, but almost everything you have said is false. These simply are not the facts :\, so I don't know what to say. I don't know from where you're getting your information, but I am sincerely saying your sources are wrong.

@_date: 2015-09-09 13:37:32
It's a good question though right? LN ideally works when most on the Bitcoin network are using LN, yes? But if that reality emerges (due to LN's superiority), then mining fees will consequently take a tumble.
One could maybe get an estimate of the magnitude by looking at the LN paper's conclusion: Bitcoin used by everyone w/o LN = 24 GB blocks, w/ LN = 133 MB blocks... 24,000 / 133 = 180... so, a 180x decrease in volume of on-chain payments. Will average fee rate (satoshi/byte) remain equal in both scenarios? If not, how much difference? Instead of $0.01, if it costs $1.80, then is that a problem? At min, it would seem to reduce choice by forcing out small payments from the on-chain network. Maybe it doesn't matter, since if that were the case, then it means LN use is widespread and so sending those small payments via LN would not be an issue.
Anything you'd like to correct? This issue of miner fees (sustainability of the Bitcoin mining network, and its hashrate) and the implications (as I pontificated about above) might make a good addition to the LN paper (but be careful in wording so you don't scare the crap out of some people..).

I'm glad the twobitidiot article was brought up and is finally being discussed in an intelligent manner. I recently posted it to r/bitcoin and there were highly unconstructive comments posted, so if I may indulge myself here... :)
Viscerally, yes, people are going to oppose raising the 21m cap. However, what if those people who matter (economic majority) can be convinced that it isn't such a bad idea, and in fact is a good idea (long term sustainability of the Bitcoin network)? If a fixed 2% per annum inflation rate is instituted, this means 50% halving in wealth over 35 years (or 50% halving in 70 years with 1% rate). Is that really so bad, if it means miners receive a steady incentive to maintain their hashrate?
What comes to mind is this part of the article:


Does this argument hold water? If not, what is the better alternative to solve the problem of compensating miners?
Peter Todd mentioned recently that he and Greg Maxwell had discussed this fundamental problem in the past, but a clear solution had never been visible and that he doesn't really know the answer. I think most assume / hope exchange rate will rise enough to compensate, but I don't think the system should be designed with that assumption in mind.
For all we know, speaking hypothetically to give an example, bitcoin may need 20 years (5 halvings, or 32x decrease in coinbase reward) instead of 10 years (3 halvings, or 8x decrease in coinbase reward), before it gains mass adoption. I think the system should be designed to bootstrap itself and able to thrive, until it is mature enough to gain mass acceptance (greater capital represented by bitcoins). This means maintaining incentives for as long as it takes until exchange rate appreciation can take over.

No one is demanding anything of mining pools. Pools have perfect right to decide what to mine. They are independent economic actors in a free market. Some will decide to choose network health as priority, some may choose short-term profit. It's their choice. In this case, obvious spam of course deserves lower priority and some miners agree. Prioritizing legit txs over spam txs is the logical move, to maintain legit user's confidence in the system. Also, spam txs won't disappear... they'll just be mined presumably during off-peak tx times.

To play devil's advocate: What stops miners from being regulated? If massive mining outfits are faced with the decision to comply with regulation, or shut down (and lose all their capital investment), what happens?
We have ~20 entities (pools, solo, whatever) mining in total, and the top 3 entities compose ~50% of hashrate. Knock those top 3 entities out with regulation and boom, Bitcoin suddenly has 50% of its hashrate. Or, threaten those 3 entities with closure, and they may decide on net that it's better they comply and keep mining.
Neither result looks good.

In that case, the majority do not understand what they are arguing. Have you seen what XT people say? This is the  theory! Furthermore, it's not just vast ignorance that abounds, but real negative effects. Have you seen this thread?


Look at it, at where it points (and with no NP tag!), and observe the ignorance and insanity, combined with the vote brigading. For nearly 24 hours, I observed an average +2 to +5 on MH's posts and a +4 to +6 on my posts (within that conversation between him and I). Suddenly, it's -10 for my posts and +50 for MH's posts.
Can vote brigading get any more insane? r/bitcoin turned into absolute chaos following the XT censorship (which I have told u/starmaged, in response to his request for comment from me, was a horrible misstep in the sense of impeding the free flow of information and discussion). Now, it is continuing by upending the vote system, which in turns turns discussion upside down and ends up stunting certain posts (about bl..st..) with unnaturally low votes, impeding any meaningful discussion.

I'd like to give my POV, briefly, since I think you mean well.
I think you take comments on the bitcoin sub a bit too literally, i.e. comments like "bitcoin user not affected", and other "cultish" sounding comments that you refer to.
When I see such comments, I personally see it all in good fun. You surely realize that a lot of very technical and serious information is posted here (relating to crypto, to bitcoin under the hood, finance, coding, business, etc.). Thus, many here are very knowledgeable and understand to a very high degree how bitcoin works, unlike most others (lay people).
So, the people (the way I see it) who upvote and make comments or posts that sound cultish do so as comic relief, to balance out the serious stuff. Bitcoin is a serious topic, but why can't people have fun while they're at it? The fact that technical information is discussed and net upvoted, and so-called cultish comments/posts are ALSO net upvoted implies to me that the community is: knowledgeable + saying things humorously.
Or, some things that you interpet as cultish may in fact be truth. If someone says they can't be touched because they use bitcoin relative to those who are vulnerable for using fiat, if you really understood the situation technically and financially and historically, you will see a grain of truth backs such a statement up.
Or, if not for humor or due to technical truth, a third reason for such comments may be: bitcoin and crypto is predicated on theory espoused by cypherpunks. This is the history and roots of the community. Even Satoshi in the genesis block made clear how he feels regarding the current political and banking system.
Make sense? So, a mix of humor, truth, and political ideology can be credited... and sure, to people lacking indepth background knowledge of bitcoin and finance and politics, etc etc, the things said in this sub may seem foreign and "cultish".
But, and this is key, this does not automatically equate to the community being loath to discuss negatives or weaknesses of bitcoin. I observe the sub quite a lot, and I simply do not see legitimate concerns swiped away.
Related to the above, the issue with Buttcoin is not that they are sociopaths (I see lots of intelligence and humor there, now and then), IMO. Rather, they appear uninformed about bitcoin, and lacking in deep knowledge about the surrounding ecosystem, the players, the potential, the realities of the strength of the tech, etc.
Basically, Buttcoiners are ignorant usually and negative, while Bitcoiners are knowledgeable and thus positive and optimistic. THIS is why they are disliked. No one likes a negative Nancy who is unable or unwilling to be openminded and learn. Sure, sometimes the "euphoria" here gets out of hand, but again... it's just in good fun, and provides balance to serious discussion.
An example:
pauldogwalker and other trolls from Buttcoin or from wherever make comments, as you noted. They are downvoted, since history shows their ignorant comments (not founded in reality) are made repeatedly, without genuine desire to learn. In Buttcoin, they often simply mock without understanding, reveling in their ignorance. They say things like bitcoin can never scale and laugh about it, unaware of the core fact that bitcoin is an open source software, with many in the community actively working to solve scalability (lightning network, oleganza's work, blockstream and sidechains, etc.). This shows illwill at worst, or inability to understand at best. Maybe a subset of such people were burned financially by the volatility and making poor trading decisions, and so are unhappy. Either way, they exhibit "trollish" behavior.
There is a difference between productive, constructive, genuinely curious, well-intentioned comments... and unconstructive, divisive, incorrect, willfully-ignorant comments. The fact is bitcoin is extremely vibrant technology with endless possibilities. It's unrealized potential currently, but the potential is real and it is in its infancy. It is natural, with such a situation, for enthusiasm and excitement to exist. Denying people the right to be enthusiastic (while still being knowledgeable!) does not make sense.
But yes, I will change my mind if I see LEGIT concerns being net ignored or downvoted. As far as I can tell, this is not happening, however. I use a lot of sources for my bitcoin information, and I'm currently satisfied with the depth and breadth (and balance of info) I gain from this subreddit.
Try to put things into context, and it will make more sense. I'm happy to continue this discussion.
P.S. I found a relevant gem that beautifully illustrates my larger point.
Our friend, just made a comment that is quite ironic and lightly mocking toward bitcoin, yet he has net 5 upvotes and various people are certainly not overly sensitive and taking offense. People are lightly joking back and forth. It flies in the face of what you are claiming:

I think the argument made by Core is that, in the past, always with such decisions a supermajority was required (90% or 95%). This is the precedent that has been set, and it was set for a reason. If the level is set at just majority (75%), then 25% of hashrate is enough to maintain its own chain and allow Bitcoin to fork into Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin XT. This... is obviously horrible, as it would divide the ecosystem into two. By requiring a supermajority of 90%-95%, it becomes much less likely that one fork will survive.

Mike Hearn, we started to discuss things a while ago, and had a long discussion, but eventually I stopped. I'd like to restart with your post here, and the prior post you made right before it.
Your arguments of persecution may hold water, except for the fact that **many, many, many smart people from the Bitcoin community from across the spectrum have come out against XT, including virtually all miners**. This includes Nick Szabo, Trace Mayer, Adam Back, Greg Maxwell, Amir Taaki, Erik Voscuill, and just many others. I haven't made a list of people, but if you line up how many Bitcoin developers and cryptographers think XT is a good idea vs. how many do not, there is simply no comparison... It's a vast array of experts who think XT is a horrible approach (that BIP 101 should have been the only proposal) because it's dangerous and divisive and upends the BIP approach that has functioned for 6 yrs.
Even spectating cryptographers, like Ian Grigg, or Matthew D. Green, have said your previous redlisting idea was "dumb", while the Tor IP blacklist idea was "well-intentioned" but "not well executed". BitFury has done analysis and produced data that showed XT and BIP 101 were unreasonable. Szabo has said it's a "51% attack" and caused a "civil war".
I mean, how can you sincerely say what you are saying, when the best minds in Bitcoin (and such a multiple more than those who support XT) have said that XT is a bad idea, in so many different aspects?
How can you continue to justify it and act as if it was something that was in any way, shape, or form good (for bitcoin)? Actually, it can be argued it was good in that it helped precipitate action by Core devs on scalability, which is good since otherwise at least some Core devs were liable to really drag their feet on the issue... but that's it.
Answering your criticisms...


You're implying only you want to raise size, in contrast to the various other BIPs and informal proposal by Core devs that ALSO increase block size. You're creating a false dichotomy, which is a sneaky thing to do. Also, you've created this false dichotomy many times before, despite it being refuted. Why? Everyone wants scalability, please stop saying otherwise.
Speaking of which, for the record, Luke and Szabo both have expressed support for BIP 103, which is progress considering how you know Luke has traditionally been strongly opposed to any increase.


Is it not a social tactic to get payment processors to write a letter advocating BIP 101, and implicitly pressuring everyone to adopt it and not resist, to not even consider the other BIPs for scaling? Not to mention, the letter lied by saying it has wide miner support (the blocktrail vote showed that was false). Also, Bitpay reversed position and said BIP 100 was fine, as well as KNCMiner which reversed position.


I can't comment on u/adam3us's statement since I'm not familiar, but this is cherry picking. Back (and others) have said plenty of things that *are* true. You're really generalizing here.


It's irresponsible for a developer of your and Gavin's stature to release a software like XT with code that diverges from the rest of the network at a set date, without having consensus on it from a majority of the community. It is an abuse of trust, and as Szabo said, akin to a "51% attack". Some people who don't know Szabo's history and stature and acumen will just laugh Szabo away and say "appeal to authority", but I'm sure you and I both know how credible he is.


Dictator wise, you specifically say in XT faq that you will be the sole decider, above Gavin.
Decentralization wise, if you truly prioritized it, you would make proposals that take it into account. There are numerous examples where you have deprioritized this, whether it has to do with Chinese miners' concerns (you told them to go make an altcoin if they can't deal with it) to endorsing a position that calls for 41% per annum growth for 20 years (BIP 101 and XT). We can't predict 20 years in the future, as every reasonable person has said (not talking about users on r/bitcoin, but prominent developers of all sorts), and it's just not a wise approach. Yet, you and Gavin repeatedly push this idea without hard data to support it. Muneeb Ali has numerous times mentioned the data is lacking and that Planet Labs is a better testbed, yet it's more or less ignored.
Character assassination wise, can you be specific? Do you consider truth-based assertions to still be assassination? For example, as mentioned earlier, the Tor IP deprioritization has been criticized as "bad execution" of a "well intentioned idea". The Bitcoin redlisting idea has been roundly criticized as been really anti-Bitcoin ethos, while the Tor Project exit nodes censorship idea was similarly harshly criticized. No other major developer in Bitcoin would ever suggest those kinds of ideas, yet you did. Is that false? Going on, even reading your merge avoidance privacy Medium blog post, it's commendable you introduced the idea of merge avoidance... but even then, you discussed money laundering associations of CoinJoin. Why would you do that? Again, your worldview is akin to that of heavy-handed government views (like FBI Director Comey's view on encryption). Why? CoinJoin could alternatively be seen as preserving a human right of privacy, but you interpreted it in a very strange way and criticized it instead. --- Basically, overall, it's a bit concerning.


Most have already realized this. They don't need to be told. How can you honestly say that it's wise to hard fork, when most don't agree it's a good idea? There is incredible ego-centricism in this statement.


I agree that was a bit over the top, but on the other hand... Adam Back and the rest of Blockstream gets paid in bitcoin, and their contracts are in bitcoin. They have most of their savings in bitcoin. I'm sure they are legitimately worried about their financial status, if this went through and chaos ensued. Is that not legitimate? Obviously they care about bitcoin, which is a corollary of this.


u/theymos did this, not the Core devs. Why state it ambiguously like this, to leave open the idea to naive people reading the post that Core devs did it? I hope that was not on purpose.


When did that happen? Either way, if the premise is that XT is extremely ill advised and harmful due to it promoting a non-consensus hard fork, then isn't it legitimate to try to defend Bitcoin by protecting bitcoin.org?
In summary, I apologize if I've hurt your feelings in this post or before, and on behalf of others if you feel 'character assassination' has gone on, but people just care a lot about privacy and anonymity and decentralization. These are hot button issues in the era of Snowden and NSA, and popular at a masses level. It's a megatrend I'd say. People (and I) get emotional about this, as there should be no compromise over issues of human rights. The position of the Obama administration and NSA, GCHQ, FBI, etc. is just horribly wrong and power hungry.
I'd also encourage you to let bygones be bygones, and try to work with everyone in a collaborative manner. It's not necessary to be this combative. Collaboration and compromise can achieve wonders, seriously. Let's all stop stereotyping and ridiculing each other.
If you mean what you say about Lighthouse and smart contracts (and your great work on threat modeling), then please go back to that! Work on it, and everyone will be happier. I remember how popular your work has been in the past, before all this XT business occurred.

I think you're overreaching a bit.
A relevant quote:


Chain acknowledges they need to pay a miner fee (no pun intended) of "only pennies worth" each time an asset is created or transferred, as part of the network's requirement, to keep the Bitcoin protocol secure (by paying miners). So they are helping secure the network. On the other hand, it's not Chain's job to find a way to boost the price of bitcoin; I think that expectation is unrealistic.

Re: soft fork, u/petertodd has discussed this, though no formal BIP has been written. But I hope we can contextualize it, and keep in mind the benefits achieved in exchange for the costs. CT privacy is IMO a major win, especially when combined with the potential to create perfected CoinJoin txs.
So, regarding the rest... Elements Alpha may have been designed as it was for the reasons you have given. However, I'm arguing that for CT to be effective and provide real privacy, it *must* be enabled at the protocol level by default, and be mandatory. Otherwise, it's flawed and weak because non-CT txs may unravel the privacy of CT txs. I think it's called a 'correlation attack'. So anyway, I think this assumption must be there.
(Even Monero is now realizing their design is flawed because mixin = 0 is the default, which has meant 75% of all txs use 0, which means Monero's privacy is weak despite being theoretically strong. So now, they want to hard fork to mandate a min mixin = 3.)
With this assumption (made so that real privacy is achieved, instead of 'privacy theatre'), I think the ensuing plan should be to try to make it practical for all txs to be CT txs. As u/nullc has said, this would occur by hard work and ingenuity... Optimizing the overhead and computational load of CT txs so that it's feasible. And, until then, creating a CT side chain (and Zerocash side chain like you said). Basically, I'm advocating true privacy as a firm goal and doing work to achieve that.
Please let me know if you disagree with anything, or if I said anything wrong.
P.S. I'm not downvoting you. Some oddball is downvoting comments by one down vote. I've been upvoting to try to restore vote to '1'.

What you've described is Allaire's very first statement, and a gross mischaracterization of his views. Watch the rest of the video. It's actually quite good; Allaire is interested in, and understands, Bitcoin at a very deep level. He specifically describes it as a protocol, and sees it becoming something everyone just "takes for granted" in the future, the same way a free, open, uncensored Internet is taken for granted today (in many places).

Probably because of horrible-UI apps like Armory, Bitcoin Core, etc. (even Electrum, which looks like it was designed in the 90s). Apps like Breadwallet, Mycelium, and Airbitz (even Circle and Coinbase, etc.) are going a long way to improve the user-facing design.

Are you saying greater use (e.g. by Fidelity in its back-end systems) of Bitcoin's blockchain (key: not of bitcoin itself in any meaningful way; most of these entities will pay just miner fees and probably use some colored coin / digital asset implementation) will indirectly lead people to learn about and buy bitcoin?
If not, I don't see why increasing bitcoin's capacity (in a rushed manner) is going to magically make demand increase for the underlying bitcoin. Yes entities may use it to transfer assets, but only in a colored coin manner (paying miner fees). I can't realistically imagine demand for actual bitcoin directly increasing as a result.

In what world have you been seeing typical transaction fee of 0.001 BTC per tx ($10)? That’s from late 2017. In last 2 years, it has been more like 0.0001 BTC per tx ($1) during high demand, and 0.00001 BTC per tx ($0.10) during low demand. Currently, I see 0.00005 BTC per tx ($0.50) in a medium demand (— edit: 5 hours later, it’s down to a low demand situation of 0.00001 BTC per tx ($0.10) —).
* 


But yeah, as BTC price rises, tx fee will be forced to rise due to higher $ value of BTC, because fees are paid in BTC not $. This is why Lightning Network (LN) is under heavy development, to shift lower-value transactions to layer 2 with minimal fees &amp; maximal speed. You can try it out already, like Breez on iOS or Zap on iOS.


Bitcoin is not just a currency (medium of exchange), it’s a crypto money that can be used in different ways, including also store of value (digital gold). Currently, store of value makes more sense (Google around to find lots of discussion and research on why Bitcoin is currently better as digital gold). Using it as a currency is okay right now, but needs layer 2’s Lightning Network (LN) to become more realistic. Lightning is instant, while speed is 10 min average for 1 confirmation on the base layer, in addition to fee issues.
Also, fees were reduced via segwit. You need a segwit-enabled wallet to take advantage. Blocks these days are no longer capped at 1 MB.

How is it conceivable to imagine that "existing risks" have been "over-mitigated"?
* 3 mining pools, in aggregate, control at least 50% of hashrate.
* Sure, in comparison, nodes are relatively decentralized (6000 nodes), but even here if we cite Satoshi (as people like to do), Satoshi saw a future in which we had somewhere along the lines of "100,000" full nodes. We're nowhere near that, though it's a valid question how many we truly need. I guess the answer would depend on how expensive it is for an adversary to spin up full nodes (ideally it would be at least as expensive for an adversary to compromise the node count, as it is to compromise the mining hashrate).

@_date: 2015-09-08 22:13:34
Isn't bitcoin similar? It's actually a very complex asset. It's value depends on demand for bitcoins. That demand can increase based solely on people wanting a 'digital gold 2.0' style asset (commodity style, like gold), or demand can increase as a result of companies built on Bitcoin (almost as if bitcoin represents an ETF, or value based partially on performance of a bundle of Bitcoin companies feeding back into the system as increased demand for bitcoins).

Here's a screenshot of the post:


Yeah, sorry, I realized I may have been a bit harsh, so I actually changed the words at the end. I did check out your history and got reminded that you were the person who said all that stuff earlier about Blockstream. Hah. But yeah, you know quite a lot about this topic! You're clearly not a typical troll.
In terms of one cryptocurrency, you should read Blockstream's blog posts (and the public statement by Reid Hoffman, their lead investor). They seem to make a good case that the best shot for cryptocurrency is if one currency is successful. The reason is having more talent aimed at one option, to try to maximize chance of it being successful. It's also about making the cryptocurrency world less confusing to lay people, and helping businesses being more accepting of accepting cryptocurrency. There's actually a million more reasons, but I don't want to digress.
If sidechains can truly work though, like you mentioned, then that may be the best option. We can maintain diversity and different options for different people, while still focusing development and talent away from altcoins and towards bitcoin. Most altcoins are scams designed to pump 'n dump, so this would be a good thing. Less scams in the cryptocurrency space means the public takes it more seriously.

Hey, I think you're very, very, very wrong here. Please don't be so emotional in your posts. The idea is to figure out the truth, not to automatically go with the argument of "Satoshi said 'x' so we should do 'x'!".
My intention with this thread was for people to use computer science and economics and related fields to try to make arguments, which either support or contradict Satoshi's statements. Then, there ideally would have been counterarguments made and quality discussions. The end result would be to figure out **if** what Satoshi said truly makes sense and is realistic (and hence make block size unlimited), or not.
For example, if Satoshi said this because he was relying on "client only mode" which means SPV, then we need to evaluate whether or not current SPV matches his vision, and if it is sufficient. If not, then what can be done to improve SPV enough that it matches Satoshi's idea, in order to allow block size to be safely uncapped? This is how this needs to operate: in a scientific, methodical, rational manner.
There's a famous Russian proverb: *"doveryai, no proveryai"*. It means "trust, but verify", which is the wise way to approach it. Yes, we should trust Satoshi since he was the architect and has gotten a lot right, but we need to be absolutely sure to verify what he says (produce evidence) before making decisions.
@_date: 2015-09-10 00:44:07
I agree, it's good he expressed that perspective if he believes it, and it's good he did so clearly and transparently and gave his case. On the other hand, I absolutely do not agree with his position on it. And, 99% of the community would not either, I'd wager, including not the other major Core devs. So, I'm extrapolating that he probably is unhappy about them not seeing eye-to-eye on it, which I feel is a logical conclusion.
Yeah, my extrapolation is not based on any concrete link. That's why it's an 'extrapolation' :). It seems logical to extend the idea that if the other Core devs hold privacy and anonymity in such high regard, while Hearn is forever concerned over accusations of 'money laundering' and 'criminal association' (a viewpoint which does not mix with wanting true privacy and anonymity, as he said very clearly in the concluding paragraph of his blog post), then there will be lack of harmony over the issue between Hearn and the other Core devs.
I had another idea. Maybe, Hearn does care for true privacy and anonymity, but in the case of Bitcoin, he thinks it will harm its image. So, maybe it's a case of Hearn convinced it has bad optics (bad PR), and so for that reason prefers Bitcoin not focus on that area of research.
BTW, I may be cheating a tiny bit. Now that I think of it, there is some actual proof I have that Hearn had implicit disagreements over the privacy issue with some other Core devs. I can't share it for obvious reasons though.
@_date: 2015-09-26 03:36:34
The radical transparency may be hailed, but that's just marketing. In terms of value provided to end users who will be the ones *using* the network and *investing* into the network's tokens, the transparency is not a good thing. Thus, the users will enthusiastically support increased privacy.
As for regulators, I doubt that will be an issue. As I said, there is high business demand, especially with financial companies (see DAH), for privacy. Further, the necessity of fungibility of a currency is pretty basic, so improving it is pretty well justified. Finally, there are often ways to allow regulators access, like via viewkeys in CT.

VPN is not required to use Popcorn Time. VPN is used to hide IP so that the ISP can't serve you copyright infringement notices.
Anyway, many comments in this thread are missing the point of the article. Popcorn Time has been able to make it dead simple to use the BitTorrent protocol (seeding and leeching with peers in p2p format) to watch movies, tv shows, etc. for free, or in regions of the world where certain content is not available for purchase. Thus, Popcorn Time has taken a technical/"nerdy" technology like torrenting mainstream.

That sounds true... in terms of needing flexibility to open-close channels with hubs cheaply. Maybe ask u/rustyreddit or u/josephpoon what is recommended?


Yeah, I'm not really sure what the answer or solution is, but I'm optimistic "where there is a will, there is a way". Joseph suggested some ideas, but he also said it's possible an alt-blockchain may be required for those assets, and then an atomic cross swap performed.

Please. There is absolutely NO pathway forward out of this mess that is both optimal &amp; also excludes one group or another from the debate. Even if there is a fundamental disagreement or difference in worldview regarding privacy / anonymity, as one example, Mike's views are informed by his experience and hence valuable.

Yes, she's not the best public speaker apparently (you could detect a little awkwardness in her initial monologue), but then again, maybe we can forgive her as it's a complex topic she was talking about. And, as you said, she's new to this cryptocurrency world and not yet as fluent in it, as she is in her no-less-exotic credit default swaps world.
At the same time, I found her obviously intelligent and trying to pack in a lot of information on bitcoin's past / present / future into a short 10-15 minutes. I had to watch 2 times since it was easy to get 'bored' as you said it and lose focus, and it was highly condensed. She made lots of really insightful points, and her words were very carefully made and measured (example: "bitcoin doesn't eliminate risk, it has to be thought of in context to the existing system; bitcoin makes penetrating the system increasingly infeasible as time passes").


Really? I was imagining her expert knowledge of the legacy system would help her in the quest to interface the old system with the new system (bitcoin), to allow the new system to optimize and disintermediate old processes. The things she said in her talk show she knows the legacy system very much in-depth, as well as the new system. She wants to increase speed / efficiency with blockchain tech; that's her ultimate aim, and she expects the effect to be that some existing firms will not adapt and go out of business, while those which adapt will stay in business.


I don't think she is being heralded as a spokesperson. There were plenty of other speakers at that conference. She's just giving her take, based on her startup.


For a long-term JPM player to show up alone must be difficult, having been so accustomed to the legacy system. She not only did that, she read up and gained a degree of expertise in blockchain tech, she was able to open her mind and appreciate its strengths and critique legacy systems, *and* she has started from scratch a startup company based on the system. I think it's impressive.
@_date: 2015-09-08 04:33:56
Where do you see evidence of that? A summary transcript of the point of the video you linked is as follows:








Throughout her talk, Masters described cryptocurrency strictly from the standpoint of Bitcoin, but without using the word 'bitcoin'. Then, at the end of the talk, she asked the audience if they wondered why she didn't say 'bitcoin', and answered her own question by saying it's because blockchain can apply to more than just bitcoin. This means to me she is saying there is more than just currency aspect (little 'b' bitcoin, as an asset that can be transferred p2p); there is also everything else Blockchain (big 'B' Bitcoin) can apply to (e.g. land titles, wills, deeds, identity, colored coin applications, etc. etc.), based on its properties of decentralized trust and immutable ledger.
Further, Masters specifically said in her talk that the token (bitcoin) incentivizes the miners (or nodes) to secure the system. So, she is not trying to separate bitcoin from blockchain. She really does understand how bitcoin works (in contrast to most other entities on Wall St. that are still in denial, trying to use it while not really using it -- at least that's been their public facing POV), and seems to be validating it, albeit saying also that it requires much more development before it's fit to handle the trillions of dollars that she aspires it to via her company (in combination with private ledger tech to help interface with legacy financial systems). -- As an aside, even if it is to handle trillions of dollars, that doesn't necessitate bitcoin's market cap to be worth trillions (or maybe it does? I'm not entirely sure).
So, going back to her final answer to the interviewer's question, I think it's possible Masters is trying to say it shouldn't be called 'Bitcoin companies', since these future companies' purpose won't really be 'bitcoin' but rather something that uses the Bitcoin (blockchain) system to deliver a good/service. In other words, I think she was just taking issue with the terminology. Hoffman had also been trying to say that Bitcoin's technology would be used in non-bitcoin-as-asset ways by future companies and that those companies will be worth a lot; Masters was just trying to phrase it more accurately by using the term 'blockchain' or 'distributed ledger' based companies.
Just my opinion, but I'm pretty confident I'm interpreting it mostly correctly.

Okay, thanks for writing a reasonable response. For a sec, I had almost given up hope. I actually agree with what you said, and I guess it's a good point. I realized it and then apparently forgot it again, due to getting emotional by reading Hearn's 2 posts.
I agree free expression needs to be allowed without judging someone's character. I'm guilty of judging Hearn as having ulterior motives by suggesting these things. It just makes me very worried to read things like that, when no other major Bitcoin developer has every said anything of the sort.
I guess I'll withdraw the argument though.
However! Have you asked Hearn if he still believes in those ideas (regarding redlisting and the idea deliver to Tor devs)? Back has suggested that discussion with Hearn reveals Hearn still believes those ideas... and that would go against your assumption that Hearn does not.

In that case, the majority do not understand what they are arguing. Have you seen what XT people say? This is the  theory! Furthermore, it's not just vast ignorance that abounds, but real negative effects. Have you seen this thread?


Look at it, at where it points (and with no NP tag!), and observe the ignorance and insanity, combined with the vote brigading. For nearly 24 hours, I observed an average +2 to +5 on MH's posts and a +4 to +6 on my posts (within that conversation between him and I). Suddenly, it's -10 for my posts and +50 for MH's posts.
Can vote brigading get any more insane? r/bitcoin turned into absolute chaos following the XT censorship (which I have told u/starmaged, in response to his request for comment from me, was a horrible misstep in the sense of impeding the free flow of information and discussion). Now, it is continuing by upending the vote system, which in turns turns discussion upside down and ends up stunting certain posts (about bl..st..) with unnaturally low votes, impeding any meaningful discussion.

It is extremists who are doing the DDoS attacks against XT nodes (btw DDoS is done against regular Core nodes too, but because there are so many Core nodes the effect is lessened). Similarly, it is extremists conducting the periodic transaction spam attacks on the overall bitcoin network to try to force people to adopt XT. The existence of a minority of extremists is inevitable in any group, and natural. It's no reason to get emotional and point fingers at the whole side.
The good thing is all these attacks will only prepare the Bitcoin network to deal with weaknesses now, rather than kick the can down the road and deal with it later when much better-funded adversaries take a shot.

I think you missed one part of the letter, which I'll provide for your convenience:


@_date: 2015-09-08 22:02:26
The nuance you are looking for exists in several ways (although I'm no expert in the matter; others have taken time to analyze it far more deeply than I'm about to!):
* Satoshi mentions SPV clients being used, but current SPV clients do not use the 'fraud proofs' cited by Satoshi because of complications (instead of only downloading a single invalid block, often errors crop up that make the SPV client want to download entire block chain, which is obviously not viable for an SPV client ... u/maaku7 discussed ( this recently) -- "One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency." --&gt; hence SPV is not as secure as Satoshi wanted.
* Satoshi said, "I anticipate there will never be more than 100,000 nodes, probably less. It will reach an equilibrium..." --&gt; we don't have anywhere close to 100,000 nodes, more like 6,000 or 6%.
* Satoshi mentions a "subset" of full nodes will be high-powered nodes in data centers, while others will process less data --&gt; important is the distinction that it is only a small set of the overall node count that exists in data centers... there was never any indication that all nodes should run in data centers, plus the point of there existing ~100,000 nodes is relevant too. That many nodes aren't going to just exist in data centers, which by itself disproves the idea of "Satoshi said nodes in data centers is ok"
* Back then, all miners ran full nodes (no SPV mining and other shortcuts). Further, non-full node wallets were in limited or zero supply. So, full node count was much higher. Today, we have much higher miner centralization (due to many reasons), as well as drastically reduced full nodes. --&gt; this obviously represents a much less decentralized system than ideal.
Why do we even care about maintaining enough decentralization of the system? To keep Bitcoin policy-neutral and censorship-resistant and resistant to attack in general. Disregarding these concerns means Bitcoin can easily turn into a centralized Visa 2.0, instead of evolving into digital gold 2.0. Which is more valuable? For reasons of freedom, privacy, anonymity, security, and even monetary value -- digital gold 2.0.

Omg, this sounds incredible. Where was all this announced?
@_date: 2015-09-29 17:47:59
No, it's a proposal to hard for to 2MB immediately (i.e. within 3-6 months) followed by automatic increases to 4MB then 8MB. Just 1 hard fork.
How is it then "back to square one"? We'd be sitting at 8MB blocks in 4 years time.
The idea is it's very difficult to accurately predict the network's state in a long-term fashion. Anything could change. The variables are vast. For all we know, the internet expansion efforts by Tesla, Google, Facebook, and Richard Branson could result in ubiquitous global high-speed internet in 4 years. In that case, bandwidth would no longer be a bottle neck, and we could increase block size more aggressively. Or, not... the point is to see in 4 years how node count is affected, how mining distribution is affected, etc... and only then evaluate the next steps.

Care to back that up?
My recent submissions (out of the last 12, 1 was about Blockstream):


My opinions are always pro Blockstream? If I think Blockstream's projects (sidechains + Lightning) are really innovative and good for Bitcoin, then obviously I'll speak positively of Blockstream. Where's the surprise?
I speak positively of things I believe in; another example is r/JoinMarket (usable and incentivized CoinJoin).

Awesome, Denis, thanks.
How have things been last 3 months? I know the first month there was collaboration with various Core committers and review by u/nullc, but since then I haven't seen nor heard much. Anything new happen??
Also, a point of inquiry. After all was said and done with the updated paper, how do the 'performance measures' of CCT compare with CT and with CJ, and also compare otherwise with Bitcoin txs as they currently are?
u/nullc opened a privacy issue tracker on GitHub for Bitcoin, and raised these questions. I didn't see CCT mentioned there, so I'm letting you know, in case you want to help answer those questions and move the dial forward.


The more clarity is achieved on the matter, the more quickly debate can progress, and the faster CT/CCT can be potentially adopted in Bitcoin by default (or minimum as a sidechain, once that area is ready). At the moment, for whatever reason, discussion seems stalled on the privacy tracker, despite things being opened up for discussion with much exuberance.

Definitely, financial incentives are the only incentives guaranteed in practice to work, as we can see from numerous examples (mining, r/JoinMarket liquidity, etc.).
One idea is to combine Lightning Network nodes with Bitcoin full nodes into one software. This way, anyone who runs a full node will receive tiny payments to help relay Lightning traffic on Bitcoin.
A more complicated idea is to hard fork and create a separate revenue stream (similar to existing miner fee) for nodes (node fee).

Can you explain clearly, and please elaborate exactly the reasons why you think SPV is insecure (even when used over Tor)? Longer than just "They essentially operate by trusting random unauthenticated nodes" please...


Hmm, well it doesn't change the fact that breadwallet (iOS) has a very nice UI and is probably the most popular bitcoin wallet on iOS.


Automatic updates are an option on iOS, not a requirement. It's Windows 10 that requires automatic updates (I think).


Yes, everything is based on trust at some point. I guess I concede your implicit point that trusting Apple is not the best thing to do since the status quo may change at any time, but then the recommendation should be to use an open-source hardware wallet, right? It's far more practical to expect people to use something like a cheap $15 Ledger HW.1.


Yeah, it's trusting others. But, if it's good enough for the President and for big business (with high security requirements for their personal communication), then it's still something worth considering.
By the way, Apple has devoted a few pages to covering their emphasis on privacy and security, in a way I don't think Google (the next big competitor) has. I recommend reading, you may be surprised how anti-NSA/FBI and how pro-privacy their views and actions are:

The gap closing over such a long period of time may or may not be relevant. Bitcoin tends to grow parabolically... a long period of slow growth in users, then suddenly a spike. It's conceivable that 30 yrs for example is way too long a time to wait, if most of the user growth occurs within the next 10 years. So I think it's faulty to try to predict growth or block size increases anywhere beyond 5 or so years.

LN does not need a hardfork. Rusty found a way to eliminate that requirement. Also, Bitcoin does not "work" in the sense that it would be infinitely harder (without LN) to scale Bitcoin to the capacity LN achieves (1,000-10,000x).

Since so many banks (22?) have now signed up with R3, it seems they by extension endorse R3's approach. If they endorse R3's approach, it suggests R3 is no longer a 'competitor' to the banks but rather an 'enabler'. If you're saying R3 is a competitor to Bitcoin, then I do agree in some aspects it is (Bitcoin as a payment network, in particular, though even there Bitcoin may retain the advantage by being completely permissionless).
If we take a look at one example of a bank, Deutsche, we see their thinking is to completely exclude Bitcoin from their plans and instead use a separate closed ledger to increase efficiency (
If we extend this, we can imagine R3 CEV will, in consultation with banks, be looking to extend that model. Tim's latest blog post supports this view ( that Bitcoin is irrelevant, implying R3 CEV wants nothing to do with it. Assuming R3's tech is robust for whatever they wish to use it for, I don't think R3 actually needs Bitcoin. It depends on what they want to achieve. R3's Rutter has said they want to build a ledger that is "secure, scalable, and meets AML and KYC". Bitcoin is incompatible with the AML/KYC aspect.
That being said... I agree with what you said:
* Banks compete with each other so any bank that can compete outside the herd and win, will be looking for an edge.
* pointing our investors to look at R3 as validation that a substantial market disruption opportunity exists
On a side note...


So, when you say this, I think it brings up a schism. r/bitcoin is a sub where people are interested in Bitcoin/bitcoin first and foremost, as it's the first cryptocurrency and has the largest and most developed network by many orders of magnitude. Really, Bitcoin represents its own financial network (or 'alternate universe' if you like) where the cryptocurrency token can exist and interact entirely outside of the existing system. Many things are possible in that world, just one of which is using bitcoin to store wealth in a portable and free-to-use fashion without restrictions. Thus, r/bitcoin is not really here to support startups that don't make use of bitcoins or bitcoin's ledger, or startups that are looking to piggyback on the 'bitcoin fad' to raise funding or be bootstrapped by users in the bitcoin world. If a startup is not involved directly with bitcoin or bitcoin's blockchain, then I don't think r/bitcoin is the appropriate place for such a startup. Agreed?

You're cherry picking one of the points, and then casting aspersions on the overall argument. Not sure how that makes sense.
But regarding those partners, notice specifically Cisco and Qualcomm. Put those together with IoT. If some of the biggest IoT players are signing off on 21's plan, then just from this, it would be sensible to conclude that their plan has merit and substance behind it. If 21 was operating with only some random VCs backing it, then that would be a different story.

What are you talking about? I don't think you understand the very proposal (Lightning) that you are endlessly criticizing. Surely, the prerequisite for being eligible to critique a proposal, and not only that but accuse people and a company of malicious intent, is to first *understand* the proposal? I'm so sick of people who can't be bothered to take the time needed to learn about a technology. There have been so many talks by Poon and interviews with Rusty, that there is no excuse.
Lightning is intended to be part of Bitcoin; there is a reason Bitcoin needs a few soft fork BIPs before Lightning can work. Further, at any point during a Lightning transaction, the funds can be converted *on* Bitcoin as a regular transaction. Do you know about payment channels, like streamium.io technology? Lightning is like an advanced version of that.

As u/amacfa said, there was tons of 'extremist'-type comments (comments that had nothing to do with constructive discussion) being made prior to the big bruhaha caused by XT censorship. Not only '1mbers' but also 'small blockists' or 'small blockers' and endless baseless accusations against Blockstream, against Core devs, and anyone even tangentially related to Blockstream. All that occurred for a long time, and I'm sure contributed to the eventual blow-up.
In terms of extremists, defined as taking actions to really harm the other side, pro-XT had the CoinWallet.eu spam attackers (they actually stated their goal was to get XT adopted), while anti-XT is represented by the Ukrainina/Russian-based DDoS attack against XT nodes.

Hey there, thanks for asking. This is quite a complex issue, but definitely needs to be addressed.
If I visit those other subs, I see endless nonsense submissions posted (hardly anything 'high-quality' and worth reading), along with endless nonsense comments by people essentially circle-jerking in their 'false outrage' and ignorance. It's a truly pathetic sight to behold. If I saw actually intelligent commentary and intelligent submissions, it would be a different story, but I don't.
example 1: &gt; 
example 2 (read the whole set of comments between me and the OP):


In the latter case, we have the creator of xtnodes.com with apparent financial interest in keeping XT an issue, regardless of the facts surrounding XT's merit. So, this is a case of a malicious user, while the former is a case of an ignorant user. One of the XT sub's mods, peoplma or something, is also in the class of someone who doesn't know what he's talking about at all (as far as sidechains, lightning, etc.), which really says a lot about which group of users has flocked to the XT sub. In both cases of users, it's really hard to approach the issue.
In some ways, if we can rid r/bitcoin of these kinds of low-quality posters (who don't believe in evidence to back up accusations i.e. blockstream conspiracy theories not backed up by facts, etc.), then r/bitcoin would appear to benefit from it by increasing the quality of discussion.
Unfortunately, this won't necessarily happen, since:
* People who circle-jerk elsewhere tend to freely return to r/bitcoin to post nonsense and upvote/downvote accordingly, thus continuing to encourage discord here.
* Certain policies by theymos have been ridiculous (as shown by lots of intelligent r/bitcoin posters voicing their opinion on that main 1000 comment thread). That does not help the case. When influential (and really wealthy) people like Roger Ver further get caught up in it (now posting on Twitter about the 'censorship'), again, it doesn't help and instead will inevitably backfire. Ver has already since become an XT promoter... thus achieving the exact opposite intended effect.
Since it's quite impossible to truly ban people from a sub-reddit (unless it is made private), it would seem theymos' policy and 'lack of care even if 90% of r/bitcoin members leave' is misguided. Instead of taking an aggressive 'authoritarian' and 'heavy-handed' approach (which seems doomed to fail?), it would be smarter to implement policies that can *actually* be enforced and that do help the 'other side' be able to justify themselves.
Policies that do not make sense:
* 'XT' censorship (Censorship is something that is inherently anathema to this community. Regardless of reasons, censoring XT was the worst idea possible. It is what has spawned the majority of the discord, and succeeded in partially fracturing the community and openly turning r/bitcoin into a laughing stock, whether truly deserved or not. --- Looking at it another way, there is no rationale to censor XT. Free and open discussion is the way to go. Before this policy, XT had only a very small grasp with the public. It was beginning to be seen for what it was, and the obvious negative aspects of XT were being realized. XT was being downvoted naturally, and also Blockstream conspiracy comments were also being naturally downvoted. BUT... after the policy?? XT support skyrocketed. Only due to the prior merit and reasonableness of the community has XT support luckily come back down now, as people see that XT really isn't a good idea and that regardless of r/bitcoin censorship, they can't support.)


* Openly calling XT an 'altcoin', as if this is fact (This is an incendiary action that only inflames the tension, besides being debatable and hence un-enforceable. Peter Todd can do things like this, as bitcoin's 'bad cop', but for mods here and other hardcore-Core supporters to do the same is not going to win any supporters to this side. I see it, and I feel repulsed, even though I fully support Core and the Core developers. Essentially, there is a degree of arrogance present among certain Core supporters that runs counter-productive to Bitcoin's development and success, exemplified for example by the behavior of user midnightmagic on IRC).
Instead of censoring 'XT' (and for that matter, even 'stupid' posts like blockstream conspiracy theories and the like), it would be better to:
* Allow the majority intelligent people on r/bitcoin to naturally see that these things are not worth the collective attention (and hence they'll automatically tend to downvote it). Allow the natural process to occur, and don't try to censor or force it along. As I've said repeatedly, this is impossible to achieve in Reddit and the age of the internet, and only pushes people the wrong way and encourages trolls to continue trolling.
* Maybe... implement some sort of 3-strikes policy (for established users), such that they are warned regarding their trolling or whatever else (on the other hand, an argument could be made not to even target such people, and to allow the 'natural process' I mentioned earlier to take effect). This way, you target the minority of users who succeed in disrupting discussion. For 'new users' who do the same, of course no 3-strike policy is needed since they are probably acting intentionally.
That's a quick overview of how I feel. If you want to discuss it overall or discuss individual points further, feel free.

@_date: 2015-09-01 16:45:17
I understand Bitcoin Core, in terms of privacy (transaction lookups are communicated to your installed Bitcoin Core full node directly). But, wouldn't using an SPV wallet that communicates to a random full node over Tor achieve the same?
Also, Bitcoin Core must run on a desktop/laptop computer. Computers are notoriously difficult to secure against malware, while something like iOS has multiple security features and is locked down, such that it's very well-secured against malware. Thus, isn't it a security risk to use Bitcoin Core?
Since in terms of privacy they would appear equal, and in term of security an SPV wallet running on iOS (for example) is more secure than Bitcoin Core, it would appear that on net it is not a better idea to use Bitcoin Core as a wallet.
Thoughts welcome.

I understand that point of view. Businesses need predictability, if they will want to invest.
On the other hand, what matters more: enabling businesses to invest in Bitcoin-utilizing ventures, or carefully and methodically developing the Bitcoin protocol so that it maintains its properties? Do we want to cater to VCs, who by and large are interested in just making a quick buck off Bitcoin, or do we truly want to create the end product of a 'digital gold 2.0', of uncensorable money, of a currency free of political and regulatory control including capital controls?
What is more important? Scaling bitcoin is such an obvious thing that everyone would want. Not a single person, including Luke, doesn't want to scale bitcoin. The problem is, when does scaling bitcoin, further, clash with the ability to maintain its properties that make it so unique and so powerful? Where must the line be drawn in its rate of scaling?
VC-backed businesses like Coinbase and Circle must already perform AML/KYC on their users, so they truthfully likely don't care if decentralization declines and political-resistance declines. They will make money either way. If, tomorrow, regulators want all miners to pursue AML/KYC on transactions too, then what stops that? -- Things like: Tor, ability to operate mining farms in obscure territories in other countries with less restriction, etc. How will that be possible? By having full node operating requirements be as low as possible, while of course still considering scaling ability, and by having mining requirements be as low as possible too.
Are we happy with bitcoin that evolves into a PayPal 2.0? Or, not? Do we want digital gold 2.0, or PayPal 2.0? I think the answer to this question should determine how things move forward.
Btw, when I replied to introshine, I just took issue with the claim that Bitcoin is "being choked to death now" -- that's patently false, if on average only 45% of block size is being used.

In that case, the majority do not understand what they are arguing. Have you seen what most XT people say? This is the  theory! Furthermore, it's not just vast ignorance that abounds, but real negative effects. Have you seen this thread?


Look at the comments, at where it points (and with no NP tag!), and.. observe the ignorance and insanity, combined with the vote brigading. For nearly 24 hours, I observed an average +2 to +5 on MH's posts and a +4 to +6 on my posts (within that conversation between him and I). Suddenly, it's -9 for my posts and +58 for MH's posts! Literally all replies to MH by others have been downvoted to -5 or less.
Can vote brigading get any more insane? r/bitcoin turned into absolute chaos following the XT censorship (which I have told u/starmaged, in response to his request for comment from me, was a horrible misstep in the sense of impeding the free flow of information and discussion, and really turned off many people). Now, it is continuing by upending the vote system, which in turn turns discussion upside down and ends up stunting certain posts (about bl..st..) with unnaturally low votes, impeding any meaningful discussion.

This sounds incorrect? Generally, every single thing I've read suggests 250x is way off, and instead that 10x is more in line.
Based on the CCT paper, a CT tx is 10x larger than a CCT tx. And, a CCT tx is ~2x  larger than a regular transaction ("106% overhead"). This implies a CT tx is ~20x larger than a regular transaction (1,000% overhead).




The paper was updated a couple times though, so not sure if the 'order of magnitude' comparison is still valid. I think it went from 60% overhead to 106% overhead. Either way, it would still imply that a CT tx is 10x-20x larger than a regular tx.

The problem is that it's subjective as to what is classified as "some risk, but within reason".
Also, it's unhelpful to say "innovation will stifle": 1) It's not true (possible to have security and innovation), and 2) Security is kind of important (we're dealing with real money here, and should be concerned about short-term benefit/risk ..AND.. long-term benefit/risk).

Disagree. Many legitimate reasons exist as to why privacy / fungibility are very important. Further, business reluctance to use bitcoin is often down to the point that they want privacy. In fact, this is a big motivation behind the development of the technologies I listed. (e.g. Blythe Masters' firm, DAH, is on record saying how enthusiastic they are about the upcoming 'Confidential Transactions' tech.)
@_date: 2015-09-27 17:26:51
I think the basic problem with Bitcoin as a payment network is 'chicken and egg'. There simply isn't a large enough number of users interested in spending their bitcoins to pay for things; most see it as 'digital gold' (i.e. structuring the issue more as fiat vs. bitcoin... less as credit cards vs. bitcoin). If a large number of users really wants to spend bitcoin to pay for things, then merchants (including NA) will be forced to offer decent terms. For now, it's too niche for them to care.

My reading of his comments from the past contradict that position. He seemed to very much want redlists, as he thought it would help Bitcoin in the PR department and help it escape niche status. He gave examples, such as how hardly anyone uses Tor but rather VPN, indicating that Tor not having any checks built-in on user activity is a bad thing (as it restricts Tor's accessibility because companies block Tor access).


Okay, then what?
And how does the reason you state reconcile with the fact that 90% of Bitcoin Core commits in the last 1-2 years were made by people who are apparently perfectly happy with the status quo?
It's actually &gt; 90%, since various people did not sign the letter purely for ideological reasons (e.g. Jeff Garzik didn't sign because he thought it would make tensions worse with the letter serving as a tit for tat to the BIP 101 letter... and Truthcoin dev didn't sign simply because he disagrees with the idea of signing letters of solidarity like that in the first place). In both cases of Garzik and Truthcoin dev though, they are more or less happy with the Core BIP process of governance (and Core devs' points of view), than not.

I presume you know XT has Hearn as the 'final decider' even in case of conflict with Gavin over a decision. The same Hearn, who is infamous for his promotion of anti-Bitcoin ideals, i.e. redlisting in Bitcoin, and even blacklisting in Tor Project:


That post had 85% upvotes and hence mass community agreement, only 1 short year ago. How does everyone forget it so quickly? How do you overlook that, and think a person with such an ideology is more fit than current Core devs, and is fit to take over from the Core developers and head XT (and even overrule Gavin in XT)?

On the other hand, it's only a 2.25 satoshis/byte fee rate, as of now. That's miniscule. Median transaction size is about 300 bytes, so this means paying more than 300 * 2.25 = 675 satoshis (or 6.75 bits) will help one jump the backlog and get their txs confirmed quickly. Or, going by  pay 130 bits to be guaranteed the 'fastest and cheapest' confirmation (within 1 block I presume) at the moment.

That's... disappointing. On the other hand, to be fair, even Nick Szabo came out in his first ever interview and revealed that he sees XT as a "51% attack on Bitcoin" and that the XT situation is akin to a "civil war". One can say what they want about theymos's decision and reasoning, but Szabo is a very impartial person who has always been publicity-shy, yet... a deep thinker, highly respected, and instrumental to ideas behind Bitcoin (especially his 'Bit Gold').
Overall, there are just too many 'experts' in Bitcoin coming out against XT (this includes Andreas A. based on the interview, Trace Mayer, Truthcoin/Augur inventor psztorc, JoinMarket inventor,  BitTorrent inventor Bram Cohen-- as well as most of the miners). At some point, one can't just ignore them all and remain insistent that XT is a good idea.
Yes, u/theymos did not have to act as he did (I don't think he did; from what I remember, XT was already losing favor at the time), and his actions went against the spirit of 'free discussion' where people can figure out the truth on their own. However, his intentions seem to have come from a good place (trying in his own way to 'defend' Bitcoin, even if the idea was misguided), and the fear over XT is being legitimized by all the other voices coming out against it.

In what world do you see “extremely high fees”? In last 2 years, typical median fee has been 0.0001 BTC per tx ($1) during high demand, 0.00001 BTC per tx ($0.10) during low demand, and 0.00005 BTC per tx ($0.50) in a medium demand.

You refer to 'off-chain' as if it's a bad thing. What is bad is 'trusted' off-chain, like ChangeTip. Lightning is 'trustless' off-chain, which is a good thing.


Luckily, they don't ask you to trust them. All their code for sidechains + Lightning is 100% open-source, and their mailing lists for dev discussion are also public. Further, as mentioned earlier, Lightning is trustless... meaning no trust involved when using it, so funds can never be lost.
I think the primary problem in this whole debate is that people don't seem to know what they are talking about, so basically widespread fear, uncertainty, doubt (FUD). To correct this, I advise reading the actual draft whitepaper. It's 59 pages of elaboration plus an appendix, so it should answer most of your questions:

You're massively underestimating the importance of security. There's a reason why the iOS platform is virtually malware-free, while Android is quite infested with malware.

He's referring to "Mt. Gox" or "Coinbase" or whatever, and how these trusted third parties can lose your money. Apparently he's not considering "be your own bank" type wallets when he says that, although that can be implicitly understood as Gates not thinking that option is guaranteed safe and easy to use (he says "poor people can't be expected to be on the cutting edge"). He makes a valid point considering the amount of stolen or lost bitcoins. Basically, bitcoin tech (wallets) is not yet mature; it's still in a great deal of flux and development, as is the protocol itself (Lightning may enter the picture and have to be integrated, scaling needs to be addressed before the 'masses' can use it, etc.). Further, Gates says he's concerned government won't be receptive to the idea of bitcoin payments, due to lack of attribution (knowing who sent money, and where the money came from).

I found it funny, but I love your posts u/elux and I realize the massive negative effect on the Bitcoin's community cohesion caused by u/theymos's policy of XT censorship and bans a few weeks ago.
Honestly, it was a serious blunder theymos. Even u/nullc (Greg Maxwell) warned you that it was an ill-advised move to make. Please, address the issue officially: reverse your decisions, apologize publicly, and help the communities come back together. Free discussion must be a mandatory and no-questions-asked policy, excluding true alts like non-Bitcoin altcoins.
Maybe you can justify reversing course after XT hits the point in 2016 that its block change comes into affect, as I guess that would officially turn it into an altcoin (incompatible with Core).

Hi Brian,
First, let me say I know you're a good person and have good intentions. However, so far I have only seen a commitment to not use patents against organizations with less than 25 employees. This indicates Coinbase is willing to use patents for non-defensive purposes to gain more market share.
Your comment to CoinDesk does not match with the idea you're conveying otherwise that Coinbase is only interested in defending itself from trolls:


So, what is your direct response to u/jgarzik's proposal, which is similar to u/starkbot's proposal? Vitalik has also commented:  as has Zooko suggesting this:  BitGo recently adopted the Twitter IPA: 
If Bitcoin companies can devote resources collectively to identifying patents to apply for, and then pool them for public good, it will benefit the entire industry and create a friendlier working environment and more cohesive community. Compete by continuing to build a better product and service, not on the basis of anti-competitive patents. Growth will be higher, and the pie expanded, when companies are driven to excel.
Bitcoin has enough obstacles and threats in its path already from regulators and legacy financial institutions wary of competition; let's not create infighting. Instead, let's keep the community (users and businesses and developers of the protocol and miners) interests aligned. This ecosystem is still nascent; united we stand, divided we fall.
Thank you,

Whaaa-t, where did you get this from? This seems like the absolute last thing I'd expect to read about XT. XT is meant to be a test environment for experiments? I don't understand, considering the argument as I knew it for XT is that it aims to bring BIP101 to Bitcoin as a whole by forcing the issue, by bypassing the Core devs and allowing nodes to run XT instead of Core. This means XT would be in control of a $3.2 billion currency. In such a situation, I don't understand how XT could follow policies designed to make it a playground for experimentation.

A) Are we? With KNC and BitFury developing sub 0.1 Joule/GH ASICs, it looks like advancements are still being made. I'm talking about a future where advancements cannot be made beyond a certain limit (i.e. advances lead to insignificant gains, like +10%). It doesn't seem like we're at that point yet.
B) Also, u/pitchbend had brought up the idea that even when ASICs hit their ceiling, electricity cost may still differ between industrial operations vs. individuals. You had also mentioned botnet miners will have near-zero costs. In the former argument, ASICs are involved. In the latter argument, CPUs (and 'criminals' -- though really they are just profit-seeking people not actually hurting someone) are involved.
My response to this general concern (disparity in costs, leading to centralization):




C) Is this guaranteed? Is there no middle ground, like I said, where PoS can work if it's instituted when inflation schedule hits a low number (i.e. when distribution of bitcoins via PoW has mostly run its course)? In other words, convert the remaining distribution via PoW to distribution via PoS, at a level that incentivizes a large number of PoS validators? From what I've read, Vitalik is researching this exact idea. Perhaps it will have merit?

6. BONUS: Finally, having the context of the previous material, you can then follow Balaji's twitter and observe what he says, what he retweets, what he favorites, along with the conversations that he participates in (the other peoples' comments, and the context)... as well as *who* is participating in those conversations and *who* is favoriting / retweeting his posts. You can further delve deeper into who is doing so, to reveal more information and context from those peoples' feeds. Basically, explore the vast array of information in the Twitter-verse surrounding Balaji. All this gives a more complete picture into what exactly Balaji is thinking and where he sees things going.


Don't look at things in isolation or with tunnel vision. That's what most people on Reddit, and even Twitter, are doing. In isolation, of course things look absurd. Broaden your thinking and look 'beyond'. New technology always seems foolish or silly at the beginning, but with enough time and effort, the tech matures and the impossible becomes possible.

Look at it, at where it points (and with no NP tag!), and observe the ignorance and insanity, combined with the vote brigading. For nearly 24 hours, I observed an average +2 to +5 on MH's posts and a +4 to +6 on my posts (within that conversation between him and I). Suddenly, it's -10 for my posts and +50 for MH's posts.
Can vote brigading get any more insane? r/bitcoin turned into absolute chaos following the XT censorship (which I have told u/starmaged, in response to his request for comment from me, was a horrible misstep in the sense of impeding the free flow of information and discussion). Now, it is continuing by upending the vote system, which in turns turns discussion upside down and ends up stunting certain posts (about bl..st..) with unnaturally low votes, impeding any meaningful discussion.

Another reason I've "come out against" cypherdoc is because I honestly believe he does not think holistically. He has decent knowledge wrt markets and such, but his thinking is not rigorous enough. He accepts possibilities, even if they are not backed by evidence. I am extremely strong on needing evidence, or legitimate reason, before I will believe something. Cypherdoc has lax standards in that regard; maybe his ego is too strong. My ego is not, and I try hard to remain humble and judge based only on how the facts lie.
re: 2




So, to clarify, it is u/theymos (God, I hate this rash, impulsive, un-wise guy now...) for essentially helping to destroy the cohesiveness of the Bitcoin community. It is not "mods". Theymos was the one who forced the XT censorship on r/bitcoin, and it is he who, at the same time, waltzed around bitcointalk (which he controls too) closing censoring various people/threads too (e.g. cypherdoc's gold thread), presumably because he was in the swing of a 'clampdown'. So, let's not blame "mods" (as if it's a conspiracy), nor Core devs for being involved, nor Blockstream. **ANY** insinuation to the contrary is highly dishonest and immoral.
On to the second point, yes, it is my opinion that u/theymos's censorship of XT on r/bitcoin and his moves on bitcointalk played the majority of the role in galvanizing support for XT. Before this move, XT had been brought up but was more or less being found out for being ill-conceived. It was around that time that it was realized in the XT FAQs that Gavin and Hearn intended to be the only 2 'leaders', and moreover, that Hearn would be the ultimate decider, even over Gavin. This obviously was not liked by anyone, even XT supporters, since Gavin is the more popular of the two (besides having some degree of 'divine right' in that Satoshi handed control to him -- not to Hearn). So anyway, the general consensus was in this direction of disfavor to XT... until suddenly u/theymos came in and threw his weight around. I've seen all over the ecosystem that the majority of people think the XT censorship was in horrible taste. The emotional reaction that ensued is mostly what made XT subreddit be created and helped 12,000 people join it (as protest).
re: 3


Yeah, I agree block size debate was basically at a standstill and stagnant for a very long time. Even though the wise thing to do would be to plan for the future and make some move, most people were content to unwisely sit still and ignore the issue. They seemed to miss the point that many entities will ignore Bitcoin until they know it has a plan in place, since it's very risky business-wise.
However, XT played its role by existing in the beginning and bringing this problem to light. And, it caused Core devs to realize their mistake and start changing their positions, by and large. Things were cooling down, progress was being made, negotiations were occurring. Most people were quite explicit that they prefer Core to XT, but that they want Core to adopt a block size increase, such as Gavin's BIP 101, and that they would vote for Core BIP 101 over XT. I'm not really going to argue this point. If you can't see why having 2 leaders in charge (with a single decider with veto power) is bad vs. the 5 'leaders' in charge with Core (with a single "maintainer" who can be overruled by the others), then you're just not being fair. Not to mention, as we saw recently, 90% of Core devs support the status quo. Is it sensible for XT to 'win' and then Bitcoin possibly lose certain degrees of emotional / technical support from the 90% of Core devs and libbitcoin devs and btcd devs? Just, no. It makes zero sense. Yes, Core made a mistake by dragging its foot with scalability, but they have reformed and proposed all kinds of BIPs and informal proposals since then that compromise and do increase size.


Yes, and that already happened. That's what I'm saying. Before u/theymos interfered, people looked for alternatives (XT), and this helped bring an end to the stasis. Core reformed, BIPs were proposed, progress was made. Ecosystem pressure was increasing for devs to reasonably attack the scaling problem. We were on a positive path forward, regardless of the tensions under the surface.


This. I don't know what people think for ideological reasons. I think it's clear we have very few people in the world with the knowledge to develop Bitcoin. Sorry, it is what it is. The knowledge is so specialized already with cryptography, and then adding Bitcoin to it narrows the field more. On top of that, add that you can't read a single book and be caught up (you need to know the history, what decisions were made and why, all the dev mailing list discussions to truly understand tradeoffs, etc.), and it becomes an impossible task to truly decentralize dev. It's simply a fact that the Core committers are irreplaceable (u/adam3us, u/nullc, u/pwuille, u/petertodd, Gavin, Mike, Wladamir, Freidenbach, etc.). There is a very small group that makes most of the commits and does the majority of development. Then, there's another group that does tiny amounts of development in contrast. So, for bitcoin to succeed, it needs its development team to stick together and be cohesive. Neither you nor me could take the reigns tomorrow and develop Bitcoin's protocol on our own. These guys have too much expert knowledge.


I'm having trouble understanding what you said before this above line. Regardless, in terms of that line, I think I've explained my reasoning above :). It's not fun or fortunate, same way that centralized mining is unfortunate yet we can't do anything about it really (maybe 21 can, if they do it right, who knows!), but it is a fact. The level of specialized knowledge is mindbogglingly vast. I read like crazy, yet I have to have the humility to say I'm not prepared to make any decisions or change anything in the protocol (too many moving parts, everything is interconnected, etc. etc. etc. etc.).
Honestly, the only way forward for the community (IF we have the high bar that we want the ideal Bitcoin, as described in the r/bitcoin sidebar, the one that gives you the power to truly 'be your own bank' and not have any regulatory authority able to interfere by introducing capital controls) is to have all the devs stop fighting and compromise together. If that does not happen, you may as well jump ship to a better alt (if it even exists) in the hopes it will learn from Bitcoin's mistakes and make the right decisions.

You're missing the other included component:


And since when are dev devices free or reduced cost? I mean, I can understand why it's a good idea, but Apple for instance charges devs just to be able to participate. And in this case, it's hardware not simply software. How are they going to just hand out hardware worth hundreds of dollars to devs? I guess they could limit it to some arbitrary number, like first 1,000 devs to request a kit, but then those who weren't selected will complain and the arbitrary number will limit participation.

No one is demanding anything of mining pools. Pools have perfect right to decide what to mine. They are independent economic actors in a free market. Some will decide to choose network health as priority, some may choose short-term profit. It's their choice. In this case, obvious spam of course deserves lower priority and some miners agree. Prioritizing legit txs over spam txs is the logical move, to maintain legit user's confidence in the system. Also, spam txs won't disappear... they'll just be mined presumably during off-peak tx times.

That's not fair at all. Maybe you should take a look at the work btcdrak has put into Bitcoin, before you use his association with Viacoin as a means to try to discredit him. The original question was fair though and I wondered myself why he sometimes seems overly concerned with Gavin.

In that case, the majority do not understand what they are arguing. Have you seen what XT people say? This is the  theory! Furthermore, it's not just vast ignorance that abounds, but real negative effects. Have you seen this thread?


Look at it, at where it points (and with no NP tag!), and observe the ignorance and insanity, combined with the vote brigading. For nearly 24 hours, I observed an average +2 to +5 on MH's posts and a +4 to +6 on my posts (within that conversation between him and I). Suddenly, it's -10 for my posts and +50 for MH's posts.
Can vote brigading get any more insane? r/bitcoin turned into absolute chaos following the XT censorship (which I have told u/starmaged, in response to his request for comment from me, was a horrible misstep in the sense of impeding the free flow of information and discussion). Now, it is continuing by upending the vote system, which in turns turns discussion upside down and ends up stunting certain posts (about bl..st..) with unnaturally low votes, impeding any meaningful discussion.




What is being done about this? What can be done? This subreddit still has value, but the signal-to-noise ratio is dropping quite precipitously and frankly, I can barely muster much enthusiasm with the anti-intellectual attitude that has become so prevalent.

Okay, so he has the right to say what he said. I'm not going to deny that.
On the other hand, his views on blacklisting bitcoin addresses is opposite to 99% of bitcoin developers (and ditto for his views on censoring Tor vs. views of Tor Project developers). So, my issue is that Hearn doesn't seem to understand or agree with the deeper purpose behind Bitcoin. As such, maybe Bitcoin and Tor are not a good fit for Hearn, which makes me wonder why he is even involved in the space. His worldview on privacy and security and censorship don't seem to align.

Key is that the rapid increase of 101 is delayed for BIP 100 until 1.5 yrs from now (2017). That gives time for alternate scaling solutions to be developed. Good or bad? Possible to argue both ways.

I see...
Yeah, I have Little Snitch, and most of the time it shows almost no download or upload activity. That's why I was on the verge of giving up on it so many times this week. It suddenly spikes to a fever hundred KB/s, then nothing.
Anyway, yes, it only has 8 connections. I read more about port 8333, and found this by Gavin 1 year ago:




This seems like a serious and potentially widespread issue (see the other comments)! If it's really true that 8 connections means Port 8333 is closed... and that Port 8333 Closed = Leeching, Port 8333 Listening = Seeding... then that may explain why initial sync takes so long. I'm guessing a majority of the network has Port 8333 closed, and is hence leeching. Do you have any stats on this matter? It seems like something that urgently needs to be addressed, either way. We can't rely on users noticing Port 8333 is closed, and then having the technical know-how to open the port.
Surely there's something we can learn from BitTorrent in this regard, to automate the process? Time to call up Bram Cohen? BitTorrent protocol has been used for a very long time and most issues seem to have been ironed out at this point. All the major torrent apps use the same basic tech. My torrents download at max speed (relative to how many quality seeders there are) and begin downloading almost instantly, and I've never ever "opened a port" or "forwarded a port". It all seems to be very optimized and does not require user input... quite unlike Bitcoin Core's performance.
*Some terms from my open-source Transmission torrent app for Mac:*
* "automatically map port - NAT traversal uses either NAT-PMP or UPnP port forwarding"
* "peer exchange (PEX)"
* "distributed hash table (DHT)"
* "local peer discovery"
* "micro transport protocol (uTP)"
*A few possibly relevant features:*
* "bandwidth management"
* "disable/prefer/require encryption"
Bonus ideas:
* Have the initial sync process first "ping", or do something else, so as to determine the fastest peers, and prioritize connections with those peers first.
* During the sync, track download speed from each peer, and drop connections with 'slow' peers, so they are replaced with new peers. Continue automatically tracking download speeds and dropping slow peers, as needed.

Like u/brg444 said, this is why mining decentralization is so important. I suspect u/balajisrinivasan's 21 bitcoin computer MVP may be very important to achieving sufficient mining and full node decentralization. If not, let's hope the community figures something else out.
I'd also like to add that other options may assist with this 'problem'. Lightning devs are apparently discussing ways to encrypt / obfuscate transactions so that nodes are unable to read transactions. If most traffic moves from on-chain to Lightning, as is expected with a fully functional Lightning network, then the privacy benefits will come in handy.

Hi, I'd urge you to open-source the wallet at your earliest convenience. Virtually every single bitcoin wallet is open source. The reason is trust. Bitcoin is a bearer asset (not an IOU like fiat) and stored directly in the wallet. There must be trust that the funds cannot be stolen.
@_date: 2015-09-03 17:20:13
I understand your concern, but...
1) This is the reality of Bitcoin and always has been. It's a 'free market', where miners can choose what to do, and presumably will act in their own self-interest. This is a fundamental aspect of the mining side of things. The idea behind it, and why it's 'okay' for this to be the case, is that miners will take actions that are in their best interest (short-term AND long-term). In other words, their greed is bounded by taking into consideration the overall network's health too.
2) In this case, miners are clearly forgoing spam txs fees and thus ignoring their short-term self-interest, in favor of keeping the system running efficiently (long-term health). This is obviously a generous action, so the outrage in this thread by various people, including yourself, is really incomprehensible to me, to be candid. Seriously. Why all the outrage? Is r/bitcoin really just drama central? This lack of reasoning ability is why r/bitcoin is made out to be a joke by many of the Bitcoin ecosystem's leaders.
3) "What next? Will users encourage or support large miners that refuse to mine (or lower the priority of) tx that are merely suspected of going to Wikileaks? Or to the Hillary Clinton campaign? Or to ISIS?" -- Considering users never in the first convinced miners to de-prioritize spam txs, this extrapolation is not relevant.
4) "It's the apparent encouragement and support for this form of censorship that I find most concerning" -- People are encouraging and supporting miners to do what I've explained, which is to act in the network's interests. Again, it's not "censorship"; those spam txs will be mined eventually. Already, instead of 50,000 pending txs, we have only 6,000 pending txs. The spam txs have hence been mined, just simply been given lower priority.

That's bullshit. Your statement is another way of saying: "I don't care about evidence. I have an overinflated ego. I think this is what is happening, and I don't care to try to prove it." This is cool if you're talking to yourself, but for a sensible debate with others, proof is required to back up statements.


The company name is 'Blockstream'. Further, why do you speak with a sense of entitlement? The company can do whatever it wants. And, it *is* in fact delivering code already. As for capacity increases, they are core developers who have been working on the protocol for a very long time and have the qualifications (expertise) and right (experience) to voice their opinion on the development. Not to mention, plenty of non-Blockstream people have the same positions.

I know for a fact that small payments are targeted to go on the LN, in that they will be most appropriate there.


There has been a paucity of data proving it, but see BitFury's recent paper. It shows that current tech will not handle BIP 101 as easily as you say. The primary bottleneck is 'bandwidth caps' I think. 1MB = ~200 GB/month bandwidth, while 8MB = ~1,600 GB/month.


I know that, but think of it this way. If total capacity is known to be 10x current use, then businesses will be incentivized to put at least 5x more data on-chain. It's estimated that 99% of bitcoin txs currently occur off-chain (not in a decentralized LN manner obviously, but in a centralized manner like ChangeTip, Coinbase, etc.). This means there is plenty of potential and incentive for on-chain capacity to be utilized if the excess capacity existed.

If you realize you misunderstood something in this context, then no hard feelings, we are all human and everyone makes mistakes at some point. Thanks.


Hi Mike, did you happen to read Hoffman's (no pun intended, lol) statement on why he invested in Blockstream? Reid Hoffman is the co-founder of LinkedIn. Or, did you read the very first blog post by Blockstream by the co-founders, on why they co-founded Blockstream and their vision? Both these articles, available right from the start, explicitly laid out Blockstream's plan: A focus on bringing theoretical 'sidechains' technology to life.
So, I'm not sure why you were *"happy"* and then *"things went downhill"* and how 'side chains' was the *"first red flag"*...
* 


* 




Working on sidechains, as I described earlier in the post, is meant as a way to enshrine Bitcoin's position as the top cryptocurrency and fend off attacks from altcoins. It is core infrastructure work, and one could imagine it's one of the most important pieces of work.
While I understand your concern about developers not all working directly on the protocol, the fact that devs responsible for 90% of commits on Core in the last 1-2 years signed that recent letter expressing support for the Core approach shows the vast majority of devs are happy with the development status quo.
But still... you bring up a good point. It would be nice to hear a response from Blockstream devs in this regard, to further clarify how they see the pace of Core development changing, since Blockstream was launched. Blockstream co-founders, u/nullc, u/adam3us, etc., can you please respond? Thanks.


Oh, come on, what the..? Lightning Network was invented by Poon and Dryja, both of whom are completely unconnected to Blockstream. Their work was funded by Blockstream *after* people in the community urged them to fund it, since it's an approach that helps scale Bitcoin by a factor of 1,000-10,000x.


What? Neither takes users away from anything, and someone of your technical caliber knows it, so why are you talking like a lay-person who is not knowledgeable on it? Sidechains and LN both enhance/extend the Bitcoin protocol.


This is why Blockstream has devoted millions of dollars in funding to try to bring these things to fruition though. Obviously they are not usable "in any meaningful sense", considering they hadn't previously been developed. Only recently was the alpha version of sidechains released, and only recently was Lightning funded.
--- 


Again, Blockstream never promised to 'develop Core faster'. They promised to develop Bitcoin Core via 'sidechains' in order to assure Bitcoin's network effect and make Bitcoin more powerful/flexible. This was explicitly stated from the start, as I've shown.


I think the Bitcoin Foundation might be referring to the fact that Blockstream has funded, with investment of $21 million, long-term Bitcoin development work in the form of sidechains and Lightning... and that no other company or organization in the ecosystem can even come close to saying the same.

It's ironic you say this, since you're such a proponent of XT.
Are you aware that, as part of XT, 1) Hearn &amp; Gavin are the ones who decide what becomes part of XT, 2) Hearn is the "final decider" in the event of conflict with Gavin, and 3) Hearn has a documented history of trying to embed blacklists (or 'redlists') into Bitcoin and also separately into Tor Project's Tor (justified by saying that by engaging in targeted censorship, Bitcoin and Tor will enhance their images and encourage mainstream adoption... nevermind Bitcoin's and Tor's ideals)?
But back to the issue at hand, the spam txs are not being blacklisted or censored. They are just being ignored for the time being (de-prioritized, I guess), and will presumably be mined later (when tx rate enters a natural trough).
@_date: 2015-09-04 00:53:36
Yeah, I'm being derogatory *now*... because you have proved yourself to be completely full of shit, as you refuse to acknowledge or respond to facts (you conveniently cherrypick out from my posts exactly what you want to); rather, instead you prefer to bury your head in the sand. You have proven yourself to not care for the best interest of Bitcoin, as you apparently have an ulterior motive.
I'm not sure why you're posting here, if you're not willing to converse? You would do better to continue the circlejerk in r/bitcoinxt and stay out of the bitcoin sub, instead of coming here just to complain when CoinWallet's ploy to spam (to encourage XT adoption) fails miserably because miners are more intelligent than you give them credit for.
I've found your 'ulterior motive', and the source of your apparent corruption: your stream of donations from xtnodes.com:

I'm not sure where I said that, but it doesn't matter I guess. My response:
Both solutions could be developed in tandem, but the problem with 101 is to sets in place a scaling roadmap from 1MB --&gt; 8MB --&gt; 8GB. If alternate solutions, like LN, are successful in the next 1-2 years, then it will be wasteful and harmful to continue to scale to 8GB. LN's whitepaper says only 133MB blocks would be needed to scale LN for 7 billion people.
8GB represents 60x more than that. The larger size becomes, the larger the potential requirements for node operators and hence more stress on operators, and the fewer nodes will potentially be run. In other words, if we only need 133 MB eventually, then there's no reason to continue to keep increase size to 8GB.
@_date: 2015-09-29 16:48:30

Yeah, that makes sense since it's "small-blockers" who have displayed mental derangement or un-contained rage (link? I haven't seen any example), and certainly not XT supporters ( who slander Blockstream and Core devs day and night, right? /s
As for CIA allegation, it's a fact Gavin met the CIA and it's a fact Hearn worked for QinetiQ... while no other person did either of those things. Whether these things are consequential, no one can know, but both things are facts with evidence to back them up (unlike the endless Blockstream corruption allegations made without evidence). If it bothers you to hear unfortunate facts, then whose problem is that?
-- But back to your implicit allegation that people of significance (Core committers, basically) have made statements to "fire up the crazies", I have seen no such thing. Citation?
Regarding police-state stuff, again, it's simply a fact (again, unlike Blockstream corruption allegations) that Hearn advocated red-lists in Bitcoin, and exit node censoring in Tor Project's Tor (a situation which, to this day, has caused hard feelings between Tor devs and Hearn). If the truth hurts, okay, there is nothing false here.
-- But again, no Core committers have said anything to "fire up crazies" in that regard either. They may have mentioned the fact that Hearn supports red-lists (which Hearn has never denied), but nothing inflammatory / hyperbolic or untrue.
P.S. In Hearn's favor, I recently discovered he was responsible for the "Merge Avoidance" privacy-enhancing idea. That's pretty awesome. Breadwallet will be incorporating a more efficient implementation of the tech soon.
P.S.S. Against favor is that even in the Merge Avoidance writeup, implicit/explicit statements are made that Greg's alternate CoinJoin tech is more dangerous because it can be linked to money laundering and criminal purposes, while Merge Avoidance doesn't have those 'risks'. Again, Hearn chose to discuss the techs in terms of risks (basically it's FUD to refer to money laundering, etc. in the context of privacy enhancing tech), rather than in terms of "how do we enhance privacy and anonymity? it's a human right and important" -- which is the way everyone on the Core side refers to that tech (including Wladamir, Peter, Adam, Greg, Maaku, etc. -- even Gavin respects privacy, going by his public statements at least). And of course, while Hearn came up with Merge Avoidance, Greg came up with CoinJoin and CoinShuffle, while Greg and Adam jointly came up with Confidential Transactions. There is a clear difference to the extent that Hearn looks at privacy / anonymity, vs. how other Core devs see the issue; there's no arguing about this matter.
So yeah, there is a lot of history in this topic. For you to think you know everything and talk in such an explicit way with that kind of language in your post... it just shows you're getting a bit unhinged yourself and perhaps too emotional. In fact, I've just browsed your history a little bit, and you really seem to have lost it. Every other comment by you is tinged with conspiracy and anger. Honestly, it'll be good for you to chill out and calm down.
@_date: 2015-09-28 03:47:24
Oh? I didn't realize this. Then again, out of the three options you listed, it seems merged mining is the best. Agreed?
Independent proof of work means restarting the process, and finding miners willing to secure the side chain separately by investing in new hardware... Which seems unlikely if they are not going to be rewarded by coin base or miner fees... Correct? Federation of signers is not secure at all. When we see the security of the main chain, people will want security as close to that as possible. Keep in mind I'm speaking about theoretical side chains that are used by the masses, not those used for testing at a small scale.
And, I wouldn't expect anyone to be working on a merged mined side chain right now since 2wp isn't ready... or were you meaning something else?

Some numbers...
* bitcoin value generated per device per day = 100 gigahash of device / 400,000,000 gigahash of network * 3600 bitcoins/day * 230 USD/bitcoin = $0.20 USD
* hashrate of 10,000 devices = 10,000 * 100 gigahash/device = 1 petahash
*Scenario 1* (10,000 added to the network):




*Scenario 2* (100,000 added to the network):




*Scenario 3* (1,000,000 added to the network):




Of course, 21 needs to commit to a scheme that will ensure all (or most) of the distributed full nodes and mining hashrate is left to some sort of independent control, so that 21 does not become a target of regulators looking to impose their will on the bitcoin network's free nature.

My concern with BIP 100 follows (if it's addressed, please let me know how)...
It seems that changes to block size occur slowly, too slowly (3 months, I believe). If a truly legitimate network attack occurs (sophisticated spam txs that cannot be easily distinguished from normal txs) of great magnitude aiming to clog the network for 1 month, then how does the network (i.e. miners, with BIP 100) respond appropriately? It will take 3 months minimum just for the size to be changed. Furthermore, the size change will be restricted within a lower bound and upper bound, perhaps too greatly to have much positive effect.
I appreciate BIP 100 makes an attempt at a floating cap that can respond to demand, and I also appreciate that the future block subsidy issue is mitigated (by allowing miners a say in block size, and hence the average miner fee) so that it's not argued in the future for the the 21m cap to be lifted, but it doesn't appear to go far enough as I've explained above.

Okay, now I'm confused.
Everything u/nullc has said on this matter has indicated that CT for bitcoin is in fact the end goal. I mean, CT wasn't invented for fun, right? It was invented to eventually help make bitcoin transaction amounts private. Further, it has been stated quite often (and is logically implied) that CT will assist in making CJ (CoinJoin) much more effective. This means we need CT by default, if we implement it.
Having opt-in doesn't make sense to me. Privacy by default needs to be the way bitcoin privacy is approached. As Greg said in the sidechains video, the web was created without privacy by default, which has caused many problems. We don't want to live in a world where bitcoin follows the same mistakes.
It is upon these assumptions that u/nullc is apparently working to optimize CT, so that it can be used for bitcoin transactions by default.
@_date: 2015-04-21 07:05:47
How is that called "biased"? blockchain.info is part of Bitcoin, fyi, so it's perfectly relevant. Furthermore, the discussion in the media doesn't understand Bitcoin, so they often just talk about 'blockchain' (while actually referring to Bitcoin).
I think this Google Trends revelation is an excellent insight, and much more in line with what would make sense.
@_date: 2015-04-27 00:09:56
It's not that people don't care about Bitcoin, it's that either: a) they have literally not heard about bitcoin, b) if they heard/saw it, they did not register it (in one ear/eye and out the other), c) they have no idea what the point or significance of it is.
Speaking on c), it's incredible how stupid and/or misinformed and/or illogical a person can be.
I asked my Uber driver the other day (who seemed a bit like a 'nerd') about Bitcoin. He said he mined 5 USD worth of bitcoins a couple years ago, then realized he paid 7 USD in electricity costs, and that was the end of it for him.
So I tested him and asked what he learned from his experience, and what he thinks about Bitcoin. His response?
"Bitcoin doesn't have a future. It has a max amount that can be mined (I told him, "Uh, yeah, 21 million... but go on"). So once it's all mined, everyone will have to move to another coin like Litecoin or something, since the bitcoins will be finished."
Where do people get this much 'imagination' from? Totally mind-boggling.
p.s. I did explain then that the 21 million units are sub-dividable to 8 decimal places (so that 21 quadrillion units will exist) and market supply/demand forces will cause prices to fluctuate and eventually reach an appropriate equilibrium level, thereby allowing the system to work.

Hey Rusty, also, has their been consideration as to where LN nodes will come from? Is it possible to 'bootstrap' the LN by updating Bitcoin Core to also function as a LN node? That will mean ~6,000 LN nodes with a simple update.
Related to this, have you seen the r/JoinMarket project? It incentivizes CoinJoining by rewarding liquidity providers (people making their bitcoins available to CoinJoin with) with a small fee. The same concept can apply to LN. Is the current design including the idea that LN nodes will charge a tiny fee to people making LN transactions? If so, if LN node functionality was integrated into Bitcoin Core, then another benefit is it would incentivize running full nodes by providing those running full nodes with fees from routing LN transactions. Boom! Finally, an incentive to run a full node (and in turn relay LN transactions).

I don't think so. That is one reason putting pressure on bitcoin's price to rise (less new supply, hopefully same or increasing demand), but I'm speaking of a different reason: increase in utility due to LN --&gt; more users &amp; greater usage of Bitcoin --&gt; bitcoin price rise.

Hi, sorry for the late reply. I wasn't sure how to respond exactly at the time. You're welcome, and thank you for the gold; I don't doubt it.
I guess I don't have much to say. We're different, then. I think it would be nice if every person was perfectly respectful, but I don't think the world works that way. Further, what may seem respectful to one person is not respectful to another. People are different, and have different tolerances even to different people.
For instance, I may be super respectful in some circumstances, but with a good friend I may be quite brash (and he in return too) but with no hard feelings between either of us. There was also an anecdote posted about Bill Gates, where it was discussed how he always responds to new ideas by attacking the idea viciously and without regard for the person suggesting it. That's his tactic to approach the idea from a post-mortem perspective, in order to separate the cream of the crop.
Not sure if this is entirely related, but I'm trying to get across that I personally do not subscribe to your idea, since I think it means lots of valuable input will get lost... besides, I just don't think it's practical to impose one's sense of decency onto complete strangers, only onto family (and even that's hard!). In the end, my way of living is to behave (or attempt to behave) practically. I have enough of a sense of dignity and honor, but I don't mind compromising it a bit to maintain harmony and allow progress.
Back to Greg, I think Greg is responsible for ideas in Bitcoin that are 100% unique and would not exist without him: CoinJoin, CoinShuffle, Confidential Transactions, etc. These privacy / fungibility restoring ideas alone, in my opinion, grant him a lot of credibility and leeway in his behavior. But back on point, in every single dealing I've had with Greg, I've never once felt insulted or disrespected; so there's that too.

In that case, the majority do not understand what they are arguing. Have you seen what XT people say? This is the  theory! Furthermore, it's not just vast ignorance that abounds, but real negative effects. Have you seen this thread?


Look at it, at where it points (and with no NP tag!), and observe the ignorance and insanity, combined with the vote brigading. For nearly 24 hours, I observed an average +2 to +5 on MH's posts and a +4 to +6 on my posts (within that conversation between him and I). Suddenly, it's -10 for my posts and +50 for MH's posts.
Can vote brigading get any more insane? r/bitcoin turned into absolute chaos following the XT censorship (which I have told u/starmaged, in response to his request for comment from me, was a horrible misstep in the sense of impeding the free flow of information and discussion). Now, it is continuing by upending the vote system, which in turns turns discussion upside down and ends up stunting certain posts (about bl..st..) with unnaturally low votes, impeding any meaningful discussion.

Also, my reply became too long apparently. It's split up into 2 comments.
**PART 1**


Right, I don't disagree there is more 'mundane' but crucial core infrastructure of Bitcoin that needs work (e.g. even the Core wallet is not yet HD), and that potentially gets sidelined as a result of work on 'exotic' features like sidechains. We can ping u/nullc, u/adam3us, etc. again for that.


Some features can be added to the main Bitcoin protocol, while others cannot. Those features that can be added, would seemingly logically be added, if it is superior that the features be added directly to the main Bitcoin protocol. But, some features may require extra testing (which is one stated use of side chains). Those features that cannot be reasonably added will require two-way pegged side chains in order to be adopted by Bitcoin.
If those features of altcoins are not adopted in some manner, directly or indirectly (via side chains), then Bitcoin's network effect will suffer, correct? This threatens Bitcoin, longterm. In order to mitigate any future threat (and hence incentivize altcoin developers not to rely on that avenue for the future, and instead rejoin the main chain and work to improve Bitcoin proper via a sidechain avenue, instead of seeking temporary pump n dump profits with altcoins), side chain work seems essential. Also, without precedent set that cryptocurrency really cannot be simply copied and cloned, the 21-million limit becomes useless and cryptocurrency cannot hold value. Similarly, without a single currency (bitcoin) that underlies most/all cryptocurrency, consumers / businesses will be confused and the marketplace will become fragmented.
Sidechains help mitigate altcoin threats of all dimensions, and preserve the viability of cryptocurrency as a whole. One way they do this is by allowing any current or future altcoin to be cloned as a side-chain, backed with bitcoin currency that possesses the benefit of its network effect, thus removing value from the altcoin.
So, so far we have at least 2 stated aspects of side chains that are a necessity and that imply utility for Bitcoin, and hence justify spending resources to bring it to fruition:
1. A test bed for new Bitcoin features, protocol improvements, etc., so that changes can be tested without endangering the entire $3.3 billion Bitcoin network.
2. A means by which to enshrine Bitcoin as the vastly dominant cryptocurrency, to preserve its network effect and hence the utility of cryptocurrencies as a whole.
In the grand scheme of things, I feel like this is something worth pursuing. Don't you? I take the threat of altcoins extremely seriously, as I've elaborated on; maybe this informs my priorities. There needs to be some way to guarantee people that Bitcoin is here now, and will be here for the longterm. There cannot be the idea that any altcoin will suddenly take over, and render the time and effort and capital invested worthless.
edit: Also, many industry participants (VC-backed businesses) have repeatedly referenced 'sidechains', as a way to solve one problem or another or extend functionality. The concept seems fairly bought-into.






I understand the points you mentioned, but these things exist with any new technology, no? We don't know everything, right off the bat. It takes time, effort, ingenuity to build layer by layer, and reach a final easy to use solution. First comes a vision, then an implementation, then refinement. The UI/UX issues you point out will surely be addressed, but at a later stage once the technology is mature. We only have federated-peg sidechains; two-way pegged sidechains are yet to come.
Blockstream, as we saw, was founded upon 'sidechains'. The entire reason of its being was sidechains. It's investors must have done some due diligence before signing off on it, right? This logically implies it's not as truly amorphous as you're picturing it, and that it's certainly possible to accomplish.
For the record, these are Blockstream's investors, who signed off on the idea of sidechains:




Further, as previously mentioned, Reid Hoffman himself wrote a long public statement on the investment, putting himself out there as endorsing it. Don't you think they all deserve the benefit of the doubt?


That's fair, I guess. I know you have also not gotten what you wanted in terms of code being included in Core. About that, I've recently come to know and read your statements and the responses in terms of "redlisting" in Bitcoin, and 'censorship' suggestion in Tor Project.
Assuming no malicious intent to give benefit of the doubt, I can understand you think those positions are helpful to help Bitcoin (and Tor) gain more mainstream acceptance from a PR point of view, but surely you realize others' priorities are not aligned with that view? To the vast, vast, vast majority of developers, realizing the ideals of Bitcoin as a censorship-free technology (hands down, end of story) is more important than rapid mainstream acceptance. If that's the case, then it is no surprise right that Core devs prioritize above all else keeping the network decentralized to allow censorship resistance, political resistance, Tor-viability, etc. to still be possible?
Ignoring that side, as it is, there are lots of arguments that can/have been made, both within the community and among Bitcoin businesses (even Blythe Masters' Digital Assets Holding), in support of strong privacy / anonymity tech, and in support of a truly censorship-free, immutable ledger. Seems like mainstream acceptance with big business support, and without needing to compromise its ideals! Further, there's the precedent that Tor Project provides military value (and value for other interest groups), and so receives government funding and has been allowed to continue. Bitcoin can be framed the same way, as providing potentially undesirable functionality from government perspective, but also providing value (e.g.: the US military is investing use of bitcoin  for informants in combat zones to anonymously and easily be tipped in exchange for information).
So, what I am trying to say is that there is a clear difference in priorities. Core devs, in my opinion, may be prioritizing things for more 'controversial' reasons, but it's possible to 'have our cake and eat it too'. So, I support that view, and do not support your view, that we need to become more "mainstream-friendly" by engaging in censorship or tainting. There is incentive for big business and military to allow it, further. Not to mention, if it's stopped in Bitcoin, there is simply no way to stop it in all cryptocurrencies. If not bitcoin, it will appear in Bitcoin 2.0 by Satoshi 2.0. Then what? This may be the  reason why a position that seeks to 'sanitize' Bitcoin is simply impractical.

If you frame the issue in that way, then obviously it means nothing. We can compare to Visa next and see how many tens of thousands of transactions per second Visa can process, but what does that accomplish? Nothing, since Bitcoin is not trying to become the next Visa which is centralized and can block users transactions. It helps to remember the point of Bitcoin.
1 --&gt; 2 MB = 100% increase in year 0 (100% increase/year)
2 --&gt; 4 MB = 100% increase in years 0-2 (41% increase/year)
4 --&gt; 8MB = 100% increase in years 2-4 (41% increase/year)
These rates of increase are quite significant. It's a short-term proposal to re-evaluate after 4 years what the ecosystem looks like, and then decide what to do.

Can you really compare a fork of Node.js vs. fork of software that governs how a $3.5 billion currency/asset works? I can't imagine how these two things are comparable.
All the analysis has been very clear that the XT fork, if it does not happen with supermajority consensus, will result in disaster since it will split the Bitcoin network (e.g. Szabo said XT represents a "51% attack" and is causing a "civil war"). A split network means transactions may not validate properly, and there is potential for lots of double spending and theft. I think you need to do some reading on Bitcoin and how it works, before making such unsubstantiated opinions.

Wences Casares is a major proponent of this 'digital gold' view.

Is this actually true though? Are you suggesting the conference was just about discussing nothing of value? Because I certainly don't agree with that. There has been, at times, an issue in Core where certain people don't seem to care about "user experience"... but this fault seems to have gradually disappeared as the year has gone on. I credit Gavin and Mike (and Jeff Garzik!) for helping end that, and emphasize importance of user experience as something to value.
One specific example why I don't agree is that Adam has made proposals like 2-4-8 which will rapidly increase block size over 4 years, which Gavin has suggested he's agreeable to, in the spirit of compromise. This proposal will double the capacity within 3-6 months, followed by a doubling every 2 years (2 to 4, then 4 to 8).


You're belittling Lightning, and I'm not sure why. No one has to form an orderly line and hand over money. It's not merely "another layer". It's something that requires soft forks to Bitcoin's protocol, and once developed and implemented, will be integrated with Bitcoin wallets. In the end, it will be a seamless experience and probably not too different from the current experience, yet have the exact advantages that you said you want!
i.e. instant confirmation of payments (no waiting 10 minutes or 1 hour), very low fees (much lower than current miner fees), and allowing true micro-transactions (down to the level of sending on the satoshi-level, I believe).

Sure, I appreciate the point and u/nullc has also stated it requires testing and in-depth review.
On the other hand, as you said, "it seems like a nicely well thought out idea with much simpler assumption than for many of these SNARK suites". u/nullc also says "The system presented here depends on no new fundamental cryptographic assumptions, only the hardness of the discrete log problem in the secp256k1 group and a random oracle assumption, just like the normal signatures in Bitcoin". This is surely something that makes testing and review (and preventing bugs) a more viable process.

What did I delete? I think everything's still posted here:




Kludgy, but it works, so it's fine right? But yeah, if it can be combined with another hardfork, and the Core devs think it's a wise option, then we can do that. Either way, it's not a problem integrating it, if consensus exists.


"CT is kind of 'version 1'. In my post, I mentioned "Compact" CT, which requires 5-10x less overhead." -- see:




We're addressing scalability as it is, through various means (block size increase, Lightning, etc.).
Regarding 'adds more traceability', I'm not qualified to answer that... Justus Ranvier will have to do that. What extra data is it? Will it be covered up with any of the other options mentioned here?




This is all correct, but CoinJoin needn't be done in isolation. Confidential Transactions eliminates that concern, and accomplishes hiding the 'other half' of the equation. With CJ + (C)CT, transaction graph + amounts are both obscured.


I think it wasn't addressed for so long because the original proposal was inefficient. It was only recently that Jonathan Hope wrote a paper on a more efficient implementation, which is what breadwallet is implementing. Point being: it's coming soon :).

2, 4, or 8 are not intended to be final stopping points. The idea is to double the capacity (or 4x it, or 8x it) to relieve a short-term bottleneck, then have time to evaluate the impact on the network (# nodes, bandwidth demand change, mining changes, network usage demand change, etc.)... as well as allow time to finish developing and testing alternative scaling ideas (strawpay, amiko pay, lightning network, duplex microchannels, etc.) that can perhaps scale Bitcoin more efficiently.

You're right about that.
Mining decentralization may be a lost cause though... unless it's true that eventually ASICs will become commoditized, as we hit some 'roof' of tech progress, and hence cheap enough to decentralize mining.
But what about node incentives? We need actual incentives for running a full node! Even with supposed privacy benefits, one could accomplish the same more or less with SPV over Tor. The security benefits only accrue with full nodes, but even there, network risks are so rare that it makes it impractical to care to always run a full node just to deal with an edge case problem.
Back to incentives... I wondered what if the coinbase reward (25 BTC) could be divided, so that 20% of the reward is distributed among all full node operators. Obvious problem is that the halving causes rewards to decline every 4 yrs. Plus, even with a 25 BTC reward, 20% = 5 BTC. Splitting 5 BTC among, say, 100,000 nodes (and I don't see why it wouldn't be greater if people can get free money by running a node), it would be 0.00005 BTC per node. That's only $0.01 (USD) per block, or $1.44 per day ($525 per year). Next year, it will drop to $0.72 per day ($262 per year). Another problem is cutting mining revenue by 20%, but miners may support it if it means a solution to node incentives and a healthier longterm network. Also, the halving is a regular part of Bitcoin (whereby mining revenue drops 50% every 4 yrs), so there is precedent for miners having to deal with decreases in revenue. Yes, a single permanent 20% decline in revenue is an unexpected shock, but it doesn't really seem too tragic vs. the benefit.
Is that enough incentive?
Of course, the payout could easily be more (if BTC price rises, or if fewer than 100,000 nodes sign up), or less (if BTC price falls, or if more than 100,000 sign up). Then again, BTC price is more likely to rise from such a low level than fall. Further, even if equilibrium level (before extra nodes drop off because payout drops too low) ends up being 'only' 100,000 nodes, then perhaps it's not an issue as it's more than enough for the purpose of increasing decentralization.

Since it's a legit issue, the "whining" is justified.

Right, but that's 21's decision. Who are people to behave in such an 'entitled' manner? How naive / disrespectful / silly / stupid is that kind of behavior? I mean, as you so rightly recognize, 21 has not given all the information out. Hence, the logical reaction is NOT to make judgements on the quality of the product (as most people are doing), and especially not to stir up drama... until all the open questions are answered (and even then one should have humility to give the benefit of the doubt to someone, instead of believing that one knows everything and can judge something properly).
As you've also said, a modicum of research on who Balaji is, his accomplishments, his credentials, his views, his positions on Bitcoin, etc. would reveal that he is a credible person with good intentions. The same is true of his firm, Andreessen Horowitz, and the other partners (Ben + Marc mainly, and to a lesser extent Chris). They are all highly successful, highly knowledgeable, and long-term 'wise' thinkers.
It's just extremely disappointing, I guess, to witness the behavior of the majority of people on this sub and in the wider Bitcoin world (I honestly thought people in this community were a little different and perhaps better critical thinkers). u/evoorhees stated a theory that it may be a result of the 'lull in price' aka the so-called battered bull syndrome.

4-year plan *is* a compromise, though. The point is to have ~4 years of rapid block size increases (100% in 6 months, then 41% per annum), so that there is enough time to: 1) Evaluate network impact from the increases, and 2) Develop scaling alternatives that better preserve decentralization than simply increasing block-size ad infinitum, and have time to evaluate them.
The key aspect is Lightning is expected to be ready within 1-2 years. So, a 4-year plan leaves enough time to evaluate it. Make sense? This is why a 12-year plan is not inappropriate, even though (4+20) / 2 = 12. As an aside, Garzik also favors a short-term plan (his preference (BIP 102): Jump from 1 MB to 2 MB in 6 months, then stop and evaluate network impacts).

Hi u/taariqlewis, maybe you know more than I do.
How is this 'good for Bitcoin', as the saying goes?
I'd advise looking at this, if you haven't:


Basically, my feeling is banks are going to do everything they can to resist using Bitcoin (or any existing cryptocurrency for that matter), since they wouldn't want to be the cause of price appreciation in those currencies (seems like it would be iffy PR -- or maybe that doesn't matter? I don't know).
Instead, they want to exclusively stick to private systems that achieve 80% of the benefit (assuming they actually do produce benefit).
The result will be existing legacy systems may improve quite a bit, reducing incentive for consumers to move to Bitcoin and causing Bitcoin adoption rate to plunge.
Hence, it does not seem like this "validation of our industry" will have a net positive effect on Bitcoin.

Look at r/JoinMarket. No servers involved, no waiting, and quick ability to do a CoinJoin. It's currently being integrated with wallets as a plugin.
@_date: 2015-09-10 19:27:48
To answer this clearly, this altcoin has great privacy but it does *not* scale to any reasonable degree due to lack of significant pruning. There's also no "SPV" wallet possible (I think), which means only a full node wallet is secure enough to run (this represents a security hole, and usability problem). That is the cost of its privacy, and why it is not a serious contender to be a replacement for Bitcoin. Confidential Transactions solves the issue by hiding the most importance piece of the puzzle (transaction amounts), while still allowing pruning.
Furthermore, the crypto used in this altcoin is novel and untested to the extent that Bitcoin is, which again makes it unsuitable as a Bitcoin alternative or competitor. Monero already suffered a massive attack in early-2015.

Adam Back proposed 2-4-8 MB over 4 yrs, then stop and evaluate. Gavin was agreeable, based on their interview with Trace Mayer.
But, keep in mind the Montreal conference discussed lots of ideas, yet no BIPs. The BIPs phase will occur in Hong Kong. I'm guessing that's when decisions will be more likely, since many more participants will be active and presenting BIPs, hopefully based on what was learned from Montreal.

I don't know why you seem to be salivating over the block size issue, but I think you'll find news of Bitcoin's demise has been greatly exaggerated. As for Andreas, where did he say that? Since the XT split, Core feels more comfortable and free to work on privacy measures. Further, those alternatives you allude to have their own downsides and further are nearly 1,000x smaller in market cap and liquidity and basic software infrastructure. You also conveniently ignored my suggestion of JoinMarket, which also is "deployed in the wild and working" and has the benefit of working on the main Bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2015-09-20 05:34:29


If true, this is pretty fucked up. There needs to be firm pushback against that sort of thinking, if Bitcoin is to actually remain decentralized and censorship-/policy- resistant.
For example, people like Balaji (21) and the VC firm, Andreessen Horowitz (and the partners -- at least Balaji Srinivasan &amp; Marc Andreessen), understand Bitcoin at a deeper and critical level ("voice vs. exit"; "bitcoin vs. fiat"), rather than seeing Bitcoin as a mere payment system that "works just as well at $50 as at $500". They are also very influential and the firm manages at least $4 billion (very well funded). They, as well as similar people and entities, need to be made aware of the apparent threats to Bitcoin by other short-sighted VCs (such as the ones you mention from the conference), and ideally they need to help defend Bitcoin from these pressures. If this really is how some think ("wouldn't think twice about bumping the block size to 1GB tomorrow"), then it's no surprise there is this much drama being stirred up over decades-long block size increases and XT.
It's an illusion if we think simple users on Reddit and some Bitcoin core devs will be able to resist the pressure alone. Balaji and Horowitz are in the industry; they should be able to help advocate more effectively with the other VCs that apparently 'don't get it' and are only interested in Bitcoin as a fancy new Visa 2.0 payment rails.

Dip in bitcoin interest, or... dip in interest in funding "yet another exchange," when there are already plenty of well-funded exchanges (i.e. Coinbase, Circle, TruCoin, Celery, and the other smaller U.S.-based and international-based ones) and other upcoming investment vehicles (OTC GBTC, COIN ETF) that don't require a specialized Bitcoin exchange?

From my brief research, it seems Ledger is the superior device (technology, cost):
* Ledger uses a smart chip; Trezor uses a microprocessor (smart chip is more impervious to attack).
* Ledger has cryptographic attestation feature used during initial setup (guarantees device is genuine and not tampered with in transit); Trezor ships with a 'sticker'.
* Ledger retails for $39; Trezor retails for $119 (3x more).
Trezor's benefits:
* Trezor has a built-in screen (this, along with bluetooth NFC, is coming to the new 'Ledger Blue' device, which is releasing end-2015) -- However, even now, Ledger seems to compensate security-wise by requiring the user authenticate transactions with a second factor (2FA Ledger app on smartphone), thus having a screen on a smartphone rather than on the Ledger itself.
* Trezor is fully open source (I think); Ledger is 'partially' open source (details by developer here:

Excellent soundbite! Bookmarked for future reference. In that 1 minute, Masters mentions: consensus, security, privacy, and scalability ("thousands of tx/s" or say 3,000 TPS).
In fact, Masters talks a lot about Bitcoin specifically and directly (albeit interchangeably using the term 'blockchain' -- yet obviously she is talking about Bitcoin, as she refers to its creation date of 'around the financial crisis'), all of which is extremely interesting, considering who she is.
Funny enough, Masters even said, "Obviously there needs to be thought given to stress testing, [...]".

This thread really puts into question whether it's premature. People are gleefully trivializing the words of people with way more knowledge about Bitcoin, as if knowledge and expertise mean nothing.

[What everyone has said to you is valid. I'll just be adding some extra points that I haven't seen.]
In actuality, the product is available for *pre-order*, due to ship in 2 months. They have plenty of time to make their case, answer questions, and clarify misconceptions.
As for whether you find them 'unconvincing', whose problem is that? Plenty of people, especially developers, find it useful... if you don't, maybe that's your problem. Balaji is highly successful and respected (by the people who matter), as is his VC firm. Who are you? What are your credentials, that your opinion on Balaji means anything?
Generally, I just find your attitude, and that of many others on this device and its creators, to be wholly one of unfounded entitlement. 21 does not exist to serve you. If you were successful enough to have millions to invest into the company, then it would be a different story. If not, then you simply don't matter and are not the target of 21's efforts.
This may be a harsh way to put it, but at the end of the day, this is the bottom line. People seriously need to check their egos.

What about it makes you think it's the best?
As far as I know, Mycelium for iOS uses a completely different codebase (similar only in name) from Mycelium for Android. Further, Mycelium for iOS lacks key security/privacy features that other more mature iOS wallets (i.e. Breadwallet and Airbitz) have. Last but not least, the fact that an update for Mycelium for iOS was released with a bug as nasty as that one reflects apparently inadequate testing, which kinda destroys its credibility.
Security must be paramount when choosing a bitcoin wallet, since you're dealing with money.

Dude, this is pretty uncalled for. I'm not going to say Gavin hasn't made some mistakes (and honestly he did us a favor by getting scalability classified as a higher priority, as it should have been... being proactive is better than reactive), as we ALL do sometime or another, but his reply to you was completely constructive and positive. Replying to that with your statement is just...? Why? When someone says "okay let's work together" the gracious thing is to start discussing ideas. And btw, Gavin's blog post was great; it finally examined the issue of nodes having varying bandwidth demands and exploring why.
Also, if you bothered to check u/gavinandresen's history, you would see how he JUST spoke positively and constructively (walking the talk) of Lightning! I say bravo, Gavin. Thank you. Let's do this, and let's make Bitcoin kick ass again! Mostly everyone is on the same side.

Reddit's scalability has next to nothing to do with Bitcoin scalability. Not to mention, there have been talks for a long time within Reddit to try to decentralize the platform to some extent, since that comes with benefits (censorship free, etc.). This will of course come with tradeoffs, such as ease of scalability, which is why progress has been slow to accomplish the decentralization.

As others said, it's too late to earn bitcoins by mining, but you *can* earn bitcoins via another route: [JoinMarket]( See the subreddit for more info too: r/joinmarket.
It does not have a GUI (graphical user interface) yet, only a command line interface. If that doesn't bother you, it's possible to earn a low single digits return (&lt;10%) per year on whatever bitcoins you hold with JoinMarket. So yes, you would first need to earn or buy bitcoins, but after that, you can earn interest on those bitcoins via JoinMarket.
@_date: 2015-09-25 23:55:55
FYI, r/joinmarket is a practical form of CoinJoin; it should be able to solve the problem. Work is ongoing to convert the current command line interface into a wallet plugin (initially for Core and Electrum).

Yes, Mike Hearn. Ha. But somehow, it took this Alex Chernyakhovsky Googler guy to suggest real computer science ideas from Google, rather than the simplistic idea promoted by our current Googler (increase 41%/year for 20 years -- a very naive idea, since it's very difficult to predict something for 20 years -- not to mention, if you're going to predict 20 years, why not predict 100 years or 1,000 years or just let it increase by 41% forever? why incur another crazy debate in 20 years once adoption potentially involves hundreds of millions or billions of users?).
So yes, in contrast, I'm thrilled that we have a Googler who is taking a much more sophisticated view of Bitcoin and scalability, and seemingly analyzing things at a high level.

Hi, it depends on the reasons and circumstances. If adding privacy and anonymity breaks bitcoin's security, then it may not be wise to add it. If adding it means scalability is ruined and only a small number of people can use Bitcoin, then again that would give me pause. It really depends. If there's no merit worthy reason, then sure, I'll seek a coin or a fork that still believes in merit.

In that case, the majority do not understand what they are arguing. Have you seen what XT people say? This is the  theory! Furthermore, it's not just vast ignorance that abounds, but real negative effects. Have you seen this thread?


Look at it, at where it points (and with no NP tag!), and observe the ignorance and insanity, combined with the vote brigading. For nearly 24 hours, I observed an average +2 to +5 on MH's posts and a +4 to +6 on my posts (within that conversation between him and I). Suddenly, it's -10 for my posts and +50 for MH's posts.
Can vote brigading get any more insane? r/bitcoin turned into absolute chaos following the XT censorship (which I have told u/starmaged, in response to his request for comment from me, was a horrible misstep in the sense of impeding the free flow of information and discussion). Now, it is continuing by upending the vote system, which in turns turns discussion upside down and ends up stunting certain posts (about bl..st..) with unnaturally low votes, impeding any meaningful discussion.

This doesn't really make sense. Analytics info can be gleaned from many sources.

Two is the ETF aspect, as partially representing the successes and failures of the multitude of companies that choose to build on top of Bitcoin (defined by how much bitcoin demand is generated by those companies).
These two things could be described as bitcoin's own form of unique intrinsic value, right?

I've changed my mind on the post, based on u/aminok's counter argument: 




Are you being disingenuous on purpose, u/aminok? This makes me angry that you would intentionally ignore the argument presented by SFYL. You're arguing semantics here, and purposely avoiding the evidence u/_______SFYL_________ listed. SFYL said nothing about Tor filters, he was talking about (and cited for you!) how Mike went to Tor Project devs and asked if they could help censor exit nodes.
I'll re-list it for you:
* 
* 
The point is, Mike suggested the idea of redlisting for Bitcoin. That alone is more than enough, don't you think? He even did the same for Tor Project, and basically Tor devs laughed him out when hearing the proposal.
With that said, I understand the motivation Mike had for proposing his idea. At the same time, I'm still shocked he would do this. It goes against Bitcoin's (and Tor's) principles to such a vast degree. You don't compromise principles, to gain acceptance. That's what Mike was suggesting with the idea (gain acceptance from mainstream by allow the censoring of transactions). No other major developer in Bitcoin has ever done such a thing. It's just not right.

*re: 2*
a) "Dysfunctional mess"? I wouldn't put it that far, although in some way I appreciate XT's existence for bringing some sense of priority to properly addressing the block size issue. Remember, developers responsible for 90% of Bitcoin Core's commits in the last 1-2 years signed the open letter recently expressing coherence and solidity. That is not the definition of dysfunctional.
b) "Bought-out"? 100% disagree, sorry that realm of argument (guessing blockstream related) is conspiracy theory that has never been properly justified with evidence. We had this conversation at one point, when you said you didn't care for the lack of evidence and were happy to accept the argument based on your intuitive conviction. Again, I'll point to the letter, and also mention Amir Taaki was part of the signatory list (and he is the opposite of someone who would allow himself to be 'bought out').
c) I don't know if you read what I said properly. In the event of conflict with Gavin (if Gavin votes 'yes' on an issue and Hearn votes 'no', then Hearn's vote will triumph). So, you're saying you support Hearn to overrule Gavin, if they ever disagree? (see below for extra reasoning why, to me, this is disastrous -- and so, regardless of one's views on the above, Core is infinitely better than XT for Bitcoin)
*re: 3*
a) What I mentioned has nothing to with Tor de-prioritizing; it is a separate issue. It's the issue of Hearn's support for blacklists/redlists in Bitcoin (via trying to influence Bitcoin Foundation), and in Tor (via trying to influence the Tor Project). His justification is that it will help Bitcoin and Tor appeal to the 'mainstream', and that the tradeoff (accepting censorship in exchange for supposed mainstream appeal) is worth it.
Basically, Hearn does not prioritize privacy and anonymity, in contrast with cypherpunks (i.e. Satoshi, cryptographers, Maxwell, Back, Amir Taaki, etc.) and Gavin (not sure he can be classified as a cypherpunk, but at least he still values cryptography and privacy) and the other 99% of the Bitcoin community (and Tor community).

Further, Cisco and Qualcomm have allowed their logos to be displayed prominently and publicly on 21's site. Is that a coincidence? I don't think so, but I may be wrong.
By the way, it's not about 'commitment'. It's more that they are publicly talking about it and investing in it. You don't do those two things, if you don't think there is merit behind the idea. It may still fail due to poor execution or myriad other factors, but that's beside the point.
With so many spectators bashing 21 and their product, I argue it's not a wise thing to do. Either, current info is not being understood properly, or there is more to it than meets the eye (unannounced info, unannounced plans, etc.).

XT is not really an implementation in the same way that btcd or libbitcoin are, though. Both btcd and libbitcoin try to follow identical consensus rules to Core (this is why the recent Core support letter also included the lead developers from btcd and libbitcoin). XT, on the other hand, while currently identical, is coded to diverge and change its rules in 2016. That change will make XT different from and compatible with Core, btcd, and libbitcoin. It will literally be like a new coin, which I guess is why some have called XT an altcoin (it's not yet an altcoin though; it only becomes one in 2016).
@_date: 2015-09-04 02:03:55
There are two separate issues that I think you're confusing.
First issue is Tor deprioritization.
The issues with it as I've read are: a) A list of IPs are downloaded from a central server -- bad because the server can be hacked, the group hosting that server can be compromised and provide bad data, etc., and b) [insert issue... I don't remember it off the top of my head actually]. Either way, as one example, it was criticized here by a neutral well-known cryptographer professor from John Hopkins:


Second issue (and what I was referring to in my prior post) is Hearn's view on privacy and anonymity. Apparently, these are not top priorities for him, and he values censorship/blacklisting of 'suspicious' bitcoin addresses (to appeal to the mainstream), as well as the same idea with Tor. Again, criticized by the same person from before:




@_date: 2015-09-01 18:14:17
Well, I'm not going to disagree that XT censorship is unhelpful to that objective (regardless of reasons for censoring XT). But on the other hand, there has been zero censorship of BIP101 (which is the point behind XT). Thus, the ideas of BIP101 can be discussed freely and everyone can still work collaboratively.
Regarding other forms of recent censorship (of users), there are members of both sides who are "extremists" (representing a tiny minority of the overall community) and speak like stuck tape recorders for their side. They do not consider facts and logic, and do not change their mind when new information is brought to light. Such people only hurt the debate by spreading old information, making unfounded accusations, and inflaming tensions. By allowing such people to run rampant on r/bitcoin, legitimate discussion cannot occur.
Honestly, instead of the misguided XT censorship, the focus should have been solely on a zero-tolerance rule for such people (maybe some sort of 3-strike policy).

What about the suggestions for Bitcoin that are listed here (linked to 3 posts):
@_date: 2015-09-06 21:18:27


Here's my issue, said more explicitly.
Castigating an adult, as if he were a child, is not the way to get that adult to respond in any constructive manner. It is equivalent to provocation, and is not constructive. The same applies to using terms like "classic Mike", or "deliberately polarizing distorting", or "it's his signature", etc. I called you out, because by making the comment you did "extensive rebuttal, classic Mike, etc etc", you risked inflaming the discussion and ruining what is essentially a negotiation.
Whether or not Mike is intentionally making up facts (and we do not know conclusively the answers; he could just be careless, or he may have the perception for some reason, for example, that the Core devs co-founded Blockstream and then neglected core Bitcoin work -- there is room for benefit of the doubt, based on my analysis of his responses to me so far) is not the issue.
Suppose he was lying and malicious, then what? Then, I/we would achieve nothing. Suppose he was *not* lying and really is either being careless or just feels disillusioned incorrectly? Then, a constructive discussion with polite and un-emotional reference to facts would actually achieve something. --&gt; Thus, the only logical course of action is to NOT take this debate on as if it were some sort of battle to win, and not to gloat or mock the other person when some 'gotcha' moment is discovered. There is NO solution here where the answer is to 'drown' out the other side, or just ignore them and pretend they disappear. I hope you realize that.
It's great u/nullc did some research to check out Mike's claim, and that you cited it in your response to me. That's good. But, besides presenting the information to Mike, doing anything else is counter-productive.
And btw, based on what I've heard so far and the responses by everyone else, I think Mike is being more or less sincere. He obviously has a very different background on how things work, how things should be, etc. based on his time at a large organization like Google, but that doesn't automatically mean he is malicious. Even on the issue of redlists, if I think of it with a cool mind, did Mike sneak it into Bitcoin or Tor? No. In both cases, he tried to make a case of it very calmly and frankly, both on Reddit and on the Tor Mailing List. He explained in a post how cryptographers are of the mind of absolute privacy and security, regardless of tradeoffs. This is simply his opinion, and could be argued as a valid one. PGP could be named as an example of a technology that is great in its privacy properties, but practically unusable because of how good UX was never its focus.
Specific examples of why I think benefit of the doubt is valid, even in the most extreme example of controversial statements by Hearn, as he speaks kinda reasonably and calmly without ever being impolite or speaking with anger:












Anyway, I'm digressing, but I hope I've made my point that one can have different opinions on matters, yet still have their opinion respected and politely disagreed with without stereotyping them as this or that, or making assumptions as to their motivations. We can pick on Mike like we're in the schoolyard as if he's the odd one out because of strength of numbers and since it's easy, but that literally is a recipe for making an enemy and having unproductive discourse. If that's how people will behave, then it's difficult to complain when suddenly blowback occurs and Mike decides to be uncooperative and acts rashly.

Great find, this basically explains the financial industry's game plan in regards to how they will react to Bitcoin, and perfectly explains the rationale behind the recent formation of [R3CEV](
Strategically speaking, I think Bitcoin devs and users really need to speak very frankly and clearly that Bitcoin is a challenge to banks and can disintermediate them, and what the various advantages are with using Bitcoin (why people should switch to the Bitcoin financial system). Just like Uber openly speaks about the advantages of removing the taxi cab middlemen, Bitcoin needs to be promoted in the same manner. Banks are not popular entities anyway, just like the unpopularity of taxi cabs, so it should not be difficult. Public opinion should be sympathetic to Bitcoin.
The counterpoint is that this is a dangerous route to take, since financial intermediaries (banks, payment processors, remittance providers, etc.) are a powerful and well-funded industry, relative to the taxi industry. So, maybe it's actually better to grow quietly and defensively, at least until the protocol is more mature and better developed (i.e. Lightning for exponentially better scalability, Sidechains for extreme extensibility, better decentralization of mining and nodes to help the network be more resistant, etc.)...

XT is a fork of Bitcoin Core, with Hearn and Gavin in charge, and Hearn being the 'final decider' if there is a conflict between the two. XT is in two flavors, a BIP101 only flavor, and a BIP101 + several extra changes that Hearn likes. XT activates and 'replaces' Core if 75% of Bitcoin nodes are running XT.

First off, let me just say that BitFury George said recently that BitFury would try to cooperate and sell its ASICs, and that they are very well aware of the centralization concern. Whether this is genuine or not, we'll see.
Hmm... interesting ideas.


A) Instead of endlessly having to hardfork each time this situation presents itself, is there a superior algorithm that the network could be switched to (we've had nearly 7 years since bitcoin has been around, surely something has been developed?) that allows only GPUs to mine? This way, botnets won't be an issue, and the average person could mine. The problem seems to be only ASICs, since this is specialized hardware that the average person (or at least 1,000 completely separate entities) does not have access to.
B) Alternate idea is what is the algo is switched to CPU-only? People counter by mentioning botnets will be incentivized to mine, but isn't this actually not such a bad thing? Okay, botnets are abusive. People are taking over computers for selfish reasons. However, if you think about it, a botnet is usually very hard to take down (!!! this means policy resistant). Also, a botnet that decides to use host computers to mine bitcoin will likely cause the host computer's CPU to run at a high level. This should be fairly obvious and easy for victims to detect, thus leading the botnet to not be very effective (either because victims detect the issue, or because botnets are forced to be more subtle by throttling CPU use --&gt; this would be a self-correcting system since botnets would then control less hashrate). Finally, of course, any user in the world would be able to mine! CPUs are distributed these days in a very egalitarian manner.
I can't comment on your other ideas, since I don't really know much about them.
Also, what about these ideas?
* There is an idea that Moore's Law will eventually end, such that ASIC efficiency will hit a ceiling. At that point, ASICs will become a commodity and affordable by the masses, leading to mining decentralization.
* Switch network from PoW to PoS at some point, perhaps once inflation reaches a certain figure (e.g. 1%). Grant enough reward to PoS validators to incentivize at least 1,000+ separate entities to act as validators. (I believe Vitalik is trying to figure out something like this)
@_date: 2015-09-29 01:21:23
Cool, but this is old news.
@_date: 2015-09-26 05:42:54
Are there any ideas on how to decentralize mining, on the order of 1,000+ entities with more or less equally distributed hashrate? More than nodes, which we already have 6,000+, it seems mining should be the real target of decentralization efforts.
@_date: 2015-09-03 18:10:42


I wouldn't worry too much, since this falls into a different category. If they did this, then it would no longer be about making the network more efficient (by de-prioritizing spam txs). In that case, the value of Bitcoin (as a way to make txs without censorship) would drop. This would hurt the value of the network. Thus, this would hypothetically go against the interests of Bitcoin and so miners would never do such a thing.
If this ever happened, we can deal with it then :), and then yes, I would also support you in your outrage against it. The community would collectively figure something out at that point.

The fact that you responded to what was my admittedly abrasive and insulting post does raise my respect for you a little... however, my post was as it is, because it's honestly painful to read this kind of crap. Every time I think the crap can't get crappier, it does! It's just mindbogglingly insane.
At this point, it's clear that a few things are going on:
* r/bitcoin's (or shall we say, theymos') decision to censor XT and institute temp ban to various users for transgressing against the policy was obviously an idiotic move. It caused far more trouble than it was worth, and was misguided in and of itself because it makes no sense to censor discussion and justify it by calling it an 'altcoin'.
* That censorship has helped create ridiculous echo chambers in the form of r/bitcoinxt, etc. I know, as I've checked them out on occasion, and I will sincerely say the conversation that goes on in the alternate subreddits is just really stupid and of a true 'circlejerk' fashion. It's no surprise to me that your post is what it is, considering it's been fashioned and amplified within those chambers.




I'll just end the topic here. You are 100% right with that. My faith in the ability of bitcoin to resist manipulation and/or 'an ignorant mob'... is rapidly fading. I always assumed having mostly-goodnatured and passionate devs and experts (in the form of Szabo, Core devs, etc.) would be enough to guide Bitcoin (in lieu of the previous authority, Satoshi) regardless of attempts at external control.
These events show I was wrong, and that the goddamn libertarians will just later justify ignoring expert opinion with "I don't follow any authorities" and "Another example of appealing to an authority" ("omg 'authority'!!").
I don't know, maybe the only way for cryptocurrency to work is for its rules to be hardcoded from the start and make change be impossible.

*"Funny how now the devs are saying how excited they are about how excited we (the non-devs) are about a conference on scaling."*
I doubt that's what the letter was saying. Passive layman users on Reddit who yell in favor of one solution or another, without citing data or arguments, are not the target market. The target is people with influence (experts, those with large holdings of bitcoins, miners, businesses, etc. etc.). The excitement is being implied by the broad participation at the Montreal conference. See this list of sponsors, for example:


*"A scalability conference designed to focus in on ideas that will then be hashed out at a future conference? Excited? Really?"*
A reason was given for having 2 conferences, but you might have missed it. Here is the text:


*"Let us then have an open, intelligent and uncensored debate on the pros and cons of each proposal, and then incorporate the one that has the broadest consensus into the protocol."*
That is the whole point of the conferences. Again, cited from the text:

The answer to your woes lies in advancing technology.
* Fees on the base layer 1 (what we have today) must be high enough to be able to eventually fund mining security through the halvenings of the block reward every 4 years. So, the base layer (with current fee 10-15 cents) would be for transactions that are higher in value (example: a $10 transaction with 10 cent fee is just 1% of fee). The low fees for micro-transaction use case will arrive via layer 2 systems, such as "Lightning network". Lightning will allow virtually unlimited transactions at extremely low costs (estimates @ less than 1 cent).
* "TumbleBit", "MimbleWimble", "CoinShuffle", "JoinMarket CoinJoin", and other technologies are being developed (or already exist and are in use, like JoinMarket).
Environment cost of running network
* This concern isn't really a concern. Proof of Work (PoW) concept is entirely based on expending energy (work) as a way to measure work being done to secure transactions. It is the only known tested and secure way of achieving distributed consensus. The idea that it's wasteful is a myth, and comparing it to existing financial system is not as simple with a clear result as it may seem. Further, much of mining is increasingly using renewable energy (Chinese miners use hydropower energy often) and/or recycle waste energy that is otherwise lost.
Centralized mining without participation of most nodes
* Yeah, a bit troubling. On the other hand, as BTC grows, investment will increase and competition in mining will increase, as more diverse global entities enter.
Hoarding for profit
* Bitcoin is like digital gold. There's nothing wrong with "hoarding", which is a dirty word for what is really happening: "saving". Just like one saves money for retirement, one can hoard/save Bitcoin (it's digital gold or money). To have value, it must be bought and held. Simply buying and spending it is not giving value to it.
Benefit of Bitcoin?
* Censorship-resistant, no controls or restrictions on how you use it, global, fixed supply (no inflation) like gold, transparent network, open-source development, flexible because it is digital and can be used in clever ways through smart contracts, etc.

In that case, the majority do not understand what they are arguing. Have you seen what XT people say? This is the  theory! Furthermore, it's not just vast ignorance that abounds, but real negative effects. Have you seen this thread?


Look at it, at where it points (and with no NP tag!), and observe the ignorance and insanity, combined with the vote brigading. For nearly 24 hours, I observed an average +2 to +5 on MH's posts and a +4 to +6 on my posts (within that conversation between him and I). Suddenly, it's -10 for my posts and +50 for MH's posts.
Can vote brigading get any more insane? r/bitcoin turned into absolute chaos following the XT censorship (which I have told u/starmaged, in response to his request for comment from me, was a horrible misstep in the sense of impeding the free flow of information and discussion). Now, it is continuing by upending the vote system, which in turns turns discussion upside down and ends up stunting certain posts (about bl..st..) with unnaturally low votes, impeding any meaningful discussion.

The XT vs. Core difference in rate of DDoS may be true, but to clarify... the blocking of Tor nodes is unrelated. The 'anti-DDoS Tor blocking' is an older issue promoted by Hearn on Core, where he wanted to download a list of Tor IPs from Tor Project and block those IPs. The criticism was that it's a bad solution to the problem, partly because it relies on a centralized source of a list (a source that can be manipulated or hacked).
There's a second issue too, 'blacklisting' and that is also separate and an older issue, again regarding Hearn on Core, where he promoted the idea of creating blacklists and censoring 'bad' transactions from the network. The criticism there is that all transactions should be allowed on the Bitcoin network without bias, as a core tenet of Bitcoin.

Further, Hearn has a controversial past where he tried to separately get 'blacklisting' blacklisting of bitcoin addresses and Tor nodes (based on arbitrary criteria and justified as appealing to the mainstream).

A better idea is an automatically adjusting dynamic fee (based on transaction size, network congestion, etc.), as has been implemented in various other wallets now. The goal should be to make bitcoin wallet software as easy and automatic as possible for users. No one should need to do the work of checking how congested the network is and calculating how much fee they need to attach, just to figure out how much fee is needed for the tx to get confirmed in 1-2 blocks.
[CoinTape]( makes dynamic fee estimation pretty easy and even offers a developer API.

I just realized... can this tech, or a derivative, potentially be used to massively decentralize Bitcoin mining? For instance, each mining entity is forced to 'register' (to a single person for now to bootstrap the system, or register in a sustainable way maybe to 'the blockchain' itself somehow), and the ID is used to enforce a 'cap' of a certain amount of hashrate per miner. This way, no one entity is allowed to have more than x% of the network's hashrate.
The problem with such a system in the past has been no way to prevent miners from gaming the system by pretending to be multiple entities. But, if this new tool can solve that issue, then maybe we have a shot at going from 20 miners to 2,000 or 200,000 or 2,000,000 miners?
Does this idea make sense theoretically in any stretch of the imagination?

2. Three separate entities are collaborating transparently in an open source manner to develop LN.
3. No one can censor LN transactions. Even if a LN node refuses to process a transaction, the money would either return to the sender after a short delay, or be rerouted via another LN node. Also, LN transactions will likely either be end to end encrypted or otherwise made private from nodes.

Thanks for the substantive comment re: Lightning!
Yes, hubs would charge fees instead. But, since it's so easy to start a hub, high competition would exist meaning fees would be tiny. To get an idea of this occurring with Bitcoin in a very similar example (JoinMarket incentivizes users to 'hold' bitcoins so that others can do CoinJoin txs with them; the incentive is brought on by charging a fee), see how tiny the fees are here:






I agree, I'm not clear on this aspect either. If on-chain txs decline greatly, then it would imply miners have to be subsidized by increased fees OR by an increase in bitcoin's price. If increase in bitcoin's price restores harmony to miner compensation, then that's great. If not, then miners need higher fees.
But maybe there's more nuance to this, so paging u/rustyreddit and u/josephpoon.

I can't really pretend to understand what you're saying in that post, u/adam3us, since I'm not well versed (or versed, at all) in cryptography. I'll need to find a free weekend to read about this topic. But, thanks for trying :).
A few questions if I may?
1. Luke suggested CT requires 250x more block space than a current normal bitcoin tx. I think it's more like 10-20x more. What is the correct answer, based on the current iteration of CT?
2. Some people, for some reason, think privacy features (like CJ and CT) should not be enabled by default in the Bitcoin protocol. Others, like u/nullc and, I think yourself, believe privacy-by-default (not opt-in nor opt-out, but mandatory enforced at the protocol level) is required for true privacy that is not vulnerable to 'correlation attacks' (I think this is the term? I mean, if certain values are known and others are hidden, then it's possible to put 2 and 2 together and figure out what the hidden values are -- 'Sudoku analysis' may be the right term). What is your view, and what can be done to achieve true privacy by default? My guess is the opposition is over the tradeoffs, such as higher transaction size. But even there, a cost-benefit analysis should be done. There aren't black and white answers.
3. In terms of side chains, is that a possible solution to the privacy by default (and tradeoffs issue) consideration? In other words, can all transactions be automatically routed via a privacy sidechain (e.g. Zerocash sidechain, or Cryptonote sidechain, or Confidential Transactions / CoinJoin sidechain) before being sent on to the recipient (directly, or via a Lightning node)? Can this achieve the same goals without having to consider tradeoffs? Can this be mandated at the protocol level, or wallet level, by default? (I am assuming having good UI/UX for sidechains integration into wallets is doable)
4. What are your thoughts on sidechains -- merged mined vs. federated vs. independent proof-of-work? Specifically with merged mined sidechains, u/petertodd has raised security concerns. There was also the example of Namecoin recently, where merged mining has apparently not been successful and has led to a single miner having control of 70% of hashrate -- concerns?

That makes it pretty clear. If Denmark bans cash, then someone with cash can't pay with their cash. Obviously, cryptocurrency has nothing to do with that legislation in particular. The point is there is precedent for Denmark, in the future, to "ban all cryptocurrency except Denmark State-issued Cryptocurrency". If Denmark, or any other country, were to do this, then that will allow that country to force its citizens to use its money.
This answers your original point:


You get people to use it by making it illegal to use anything but that money in stores.

There's no straight reporting of the facts, only exceedingly biased coverage aiming to make a mockery:
* rather than report any details of the Mike Tyson ATM, as would be expected in an objective and professional 'news roundup', a 1-line caption is given inexplicably mentioning 'altcoins' 
* in the section on 21's computer, the topic is led with a self-admittedly 'snarky' description (energy arb as a service); elux 's post is cited but only very selectively, and it's mocked with the phrase "vigorously waves hands" when the original post had no mention of the word "vigorously"; further, Isabella's post is enthusiastically cited, notable because Isabella is one of the most anti-bitcoin mainstream-news trolls out there.
* in the Coinbase section, it's written their move "stoked the ire of Redditors everywhere" -- again, a mocking oversimplification of the issue.
Overall, instead of doing a true roundup of news in an objective and professional manner, R3CEV has shown that they view Bitcoin with contempt, with a view that is sort of a hybridization of r/buttcoin and Isabella. Low on facts, high on opinion.

I know JoinMarket is currently working on integration with Bitcoin Core and Electrum (among others, like Samourai), but depending on the ETA of these integrations... would you consider writing a very clear and concise step by step (literally... step 1: , step 2: , etc.) tutorial to be able to use JoinMarket in its current form (command line)? It should include how to install dependencies, like Python, and steps for major platforms (Mac, Win, Linux). Both as a liquidity provider (for income), and as a liquidity taker (for privacy). -- I suppose that comes to 6 sets of instructions.
The current directions are very tricky to understand for a programming newbie, and there's also a certain trepidation involved in using an unfamiliar command line interface when dealing with bitcoins. On the other hand, maybe a GUI is so much more appropriate for the task and would make things so much easier that you think it's just worth skipping the CLI and waiting for the GUI.

100% agree; thanks for this post.
I find it severely dishonest that we have endless bullish mainstream news, such as LinkedIn's Hoffman "betting big" on Bitcoin and WSJ articles discussing Bitcoin, yet simultaneously the price continues its seemingly inexorable decline. If all these wealthy individuals were actually bullish, the price would rise; it does not take that much money to move this market. Those who think the price does not matter for adoption are delusional.
If you disagree, please comment and tell me why.

Currently, no, but future security is not guaranteed.
Hive uses centralized validation (its own servers) for processing user transactions, meaning those 3rd party servers can be compromised: either by outside hackers, or by rogue Hive employees.
Breadwallet (for example) uses SPV validation, meaning it does not rely on "breadwallet's servers" (there is no 3rd party intermediary); rather, it connects directly to the Bitcoin network.

Hi u/maaku7, can you let me know what's happening?
I tried installing a full node (Bitcoin Core 0.11) on a fully-updated mid-2014 Macbook Pro with a 100/10 Mbps connection and 200 GB free space on an SSD. Basically, I don't see any technical shortcomings.
Yet, the initial sync speed has been horrendous. I downloaded and let it sync maybe 1 week ago, but it has been going extremely slowly. I just leave it open for a few hours each day, so it's been open maybe 30 hours but is still not done syncing (360,000 blocks processed).
Is this normal? If it was downloading at 10 MB/s (or 80 Mbps, 80% of my max download speed), then I feel it should have synced up in 2 hours, assuming a 70 GB block chain (not sure what actual size is).

I'm not a huge fan of u/aminok's posts usually as I don't agree, while on the other hand I often agree with your posts, but in this case, you really are behaving quite arrogantly. If you have a problem with u/aminok's position, then state your argument? Don't simply tell him that he needs to study more and call the post 'spam' ('spam' is definitely not what this can be classified as). That characterization as 'spam' is highly inflammatory in this context; it's like responding by calling him a 'troll'.
@_date: 2015-09-12 17:49:30
To add to this, maybe it helps because fee estimation becomes decentralized. SPV wallets won't have to depend upon a centralized service (that can get hacked, or go offline), like CoinTape, to determine what fee to attach to a transaction.
@_date: 2015-09-21 00:29:48
Right, just like JoinMarket! I hope LN devs u/rustyreddit and u/josephpoon are aware of JM and will be fully incorporating what has been learned from the JM experiment. Incentives will rule the day.
Btw, on that note, can normal Bitcoin Core full nodes also be incentivized, maybe with an automatic variable or fixed 'node fee' (something trivial, say 50% of a miner fee)? Nodes after all do perform a service and are very important. They deserve to be compensated by an appropriate amount. I'm sure the benefit to the network will make it worth it to increase user transaction fee by x%. If fee increases from 2 cents to 3 cents, I cannot imagine complaints really being too loud, and anyway, it can be framed as an improvement to the network (which it is). People are also free to try to recoup fees by running a Bitcoin full node if able (and/or LN full node -- hopefully they are one and the same though? Do you know if they are planned to be?).
Or, and this is much more controversial, miner fee could be converted to 'node fee' (with its current variable structure). To compensate, miner coin base reward could be extended into perpetuity at a 1%/year fixed inflation rate beginning at whatever date inflation is scheduled to hit 1%. This would also solve the problem of "how to compensate miners adequately once coin base reward gets too low" or "if volume shifts to LN". 1% means 21 million bitcoins turns into 42 millions in 70 yrs; surely this is slow enough and predictable enough to still be 'digital gold' and still be vastly superior to all fiat (Monero has already implemented this btw, I believe).
I should also mention, wrt the 1% idea, there is currently no white knight to save us. I distinctly remember reading that u/nullc and u/petertodd have discussed this problem many times, but failed to figure out a completely painless solution. So it's a problem currently without a solution.
The only other major problem left to solve after the above problems... is miner decentralization (expanding from 20 to thousands or millions). No idea how to incentivize that. Any ideas?

Unfortunately no, they are only mobile apps. Is there a particular reason you want to use it from your computer though? I ask because the functionality is pretty much the same. Bitcoin can be hacked from a computer wallet much more easily than from a smartphone wallet, since computers are much more vulnerable to malware than a non-jailbroken or non-rooted smartphone.
Personally, I only use breadwallet on a non-jailbroken, fully updated iPhone 6.

I can understand being frustrated, but does he not realize other opinions also matter? Read the full conversation that led to the OP's linked comment:


What I am understanding from this is that Mike has his own idea on the exact nature of how Bitcoin must scale and, if those requirements are not met to the T, then it means Bitcoin will die and the end of the world will arrive. He seems completely unwilling to behave in a collaborative manner and respect that he must work in a consensus model, rather than throw his weight around and bend people to his will. He also does not seem to care even now that virtually all experts disagree with XT and have moved on to other proposals (rather he is seemingly content with the approval by a minority of non-experts who are gung-ho-XT supporters (and frankly don't have adequate Bitcoin knowledge).
Last but not least, maybe I'm overthinking it, but I find his words insidious. E.g. He said "current set of Core developers" -- very clearly, he seems to be trying to insinuate that the Core devs do not matter and are only a 'current set', but easily replaced (hint hint). In other words, he is not getting his way, so he seems willing to encourage insurrection and burn the world if he can't win.
This is all the more troubling, considering u/gavinandresen is on record in the Trace interview being very gracious and compromising by saying he is willing to accept u/adam3us's 2-4-8 stopgap plan, if that's what it takes to achieve wider consensus. It seems Mike doesn't care about that... :/ and is still willing to speak abrasively and corrosively... As well as take action to lobby miners even now! I mean, wow.

@_date: 2016-10-26 07:57:51
It's difficult to say. The current surge in demand is a bit unusual. It's a fluid, dynamic system. It all depends how many new transactions are being made (and at what fee/size), as that will influence how long it takes to clear the backlog. If you're curious about what's happening, just keep an eye on that chart I linked.
Really, the issue is wallet software. Wallets should examine the state of the network, and let users know if it's busy, and so offer the option to increase fee for "high priority". That way, people who want to pay a higher fee to get a faster transaction can do it. Bitcoin is in the early days though, so wallets will be improving. Personally, I think breadwallet (iOS) is pretty good.

I mean, seriously.

The profit motive is there since it's a for-profit company, yes, but all their work is purely open-source, as I linked to you earlier. *Any* company or person can decide to use their software to make their own sidechain based business or open hubs for Lightning transactions.
BTW, you're wrong that all their employees are in lockstep...
* Rusty, the developer behind Lightning, has on numerous occasions stated he thinks blocks need to be increased.
* Adam Back has also stated publicly as of 2 months ago that he supports larger blocks, but not blocks that increase for 20 years straight. He made a proposal to increase blocksize from 1 to 2MB now, 2 to 4MB in 2 yrs, then 4 to 8MB in 2 more years.
Not sure exactly about the other employees.

Even with that mindset, fact remains it's a pay-to-play system, where you pay for the priority of tx confirmation speed you desire. Also, 'spam' can be a verb, not just a noun, and in that sense the idea is someone trying to attack and coerce the network by 'spamming' txs at a rate that disrupts. This practice has been well documented in the past by researchers like laurenmt, and Coinwallet.eu even openly confessed its action and motive. So, you can say "there is no such thing as spam", but reality would disagree with you.

In that case, the majority do not understand what they are arguing. Have you seen what XT people say? This is the  theory! Furthermore, it's not just vast ignorance that abounds, but real negative effects. Have you seen this thread?


Look at it, at where it points (and with no NP tag!), and observe the ignorance and insanity, combined with the vote brigading. For nearly 24 hours, I observed an average +2 to +5 on MH's posts and a +4 to +6 on my posts (within that conversation between him and I). Suddenly, it's -10 for my posts and +50 for MH's posts.
Can vote brigading get any more insane? r/bitcoin turned into absolute chaos following the XT censorship (which I have told u/starmaged, in response to his request for comment from me, was a horrible misstep in the sense of impeding the free flow of information and discussion). Now, it is continuing by upending the vote system, which in turns turns discussion upside down and ends up stunting certain posts (about bl..st..) with unnaturally low votes, impeding any meaningful discussion.




What is being done about this? What can be done? This subreddit still has value, but the signal-to-noise ratio is dropping quite precipitously and frankly, I can barely muster much enthusiasm with the anti-intellectual attitude that has become so prevalent.

I don't think the issue is really whether the software can "handle" larger blocks. The issue is how larger blocks affect decentralization metrics, and what rate of size increase will minimize the impact on decentralization.

There are some obvious problems with Shapeshift:
1. Conversion fee is 0.5-1% one-way, or 1-2% roundtrip. Sidechain fee is '0%', by design.
2. Shapeshift is centralized and a trusted third party with non-guaranteed uptime; they also record IP and address linkage. Sidechains are decentralized and 'always-on' 24/7.
3. Shapeshift has limited liquidity (less than $1,000 per transaction). Sidechains have unlimited liquidity.

I said that based on the the comments being made on:


Mass hysteria combined with urging to "get rid of Core" and "install XT today!", etc.
Also, read through this thread to see how resistant to reason various XT proponents are (see how their singular focus is promoting XT, and how nothing else matters -- they will go through any mental gymnastics to ignore rational arguments):


Here's another example of politicized down voting (66% right now, with no rational reason to be down-voted IMO)


I actually don't think it's buttcoiners (cc: u/bashco -- don't lump them together, buttcoiners don't actually have an underlying agenda, they just do it for the lulz). I have observed various buttcoiners getting involved in an objective, rational way in Bitcoin, &amp; having real discussions on places like bitcoinmarkets. They have even gotten involved in r/btc and noted how it's turning into a hypocritical sub (banning people for no good reason, while loudly complaining about censorship elsewhere), and a sub where people are going hysterical and promoting XT for no rational reason, and behaving like a cult by taking individual words by Satoshi literally (regardless of contradictory evidence).
... I don't think I have ever met an XT proponent, who has given a valid argument in favor of switching to XT.
In summation, IMO, if I had to guess who is down-voting the thread (and in high numbers to bring it down at one point to 68%), I can only estimate it's a subset of those who promote XT.

For some reason, Nathaniel Popper (the author) always seems to be obsessed with that. I notice the same thing every time. It's disappointing that he doesn't realize the early Internet was the exact same way, and so, it's nothing special or distinctive about Bitcoin that needs to keep being harped upon. When more people start using Bitcoin, then, just like with the Internet, usage will shift to more mainstream uses.

I'm hopeful that a short-term imperfect compromise solution can have its potential harmful impact minimized (due to: 1) being short-term, 2) great possibility of innovative technology coming out during the time it's in effect, to help solve scalability in better ways or mitigate potential harm).

"should have been" is fine. But, life doesn't always work on that basis. It's harmful to micro-manage.


"inundated with unproductive threads like this"? Are you saying this thread was "unproductive"?
If so. I flat out disagree, as is proven by the 234 other comments that have engaged in discussion and debate, not to mention the 367 points given to the thread, and the 86% upvote ratio. There has been a wide variety of discussion in this thread, and it has largely been substantive and productive. OP &amp; I personally have had a long discussion, where I took issues with some of OP's points, and OP took issue with my points, and we have gone back and forth since then, discussing it.
I'm very interested to understand how you can justify this thread as being "unproductive".
As for that [other thread]( a brief perusal of it reveals that there is heavy contention on the goal of the thread. Many people disagree (and I will add my name to that list clearly).

What "pretense"? It's not a "pretense". It's a real issue.


Blockstream does not profit, if transactions go off-chain. In fact, it's required for transactions to go off-chain in some manner (since there is no free lunch), if Bitcoin's decentralization and resistance to [Jamie Dimon]( is to be protected. Ideally, that off-chain behavior will be trust-minimized, like with Lightning.

Hi, thanks for the details. It's very helpful.
I suppose with the way you're doing it, the end result is pretty much a 'dynamic fee' but opt-in for the user, rather than enabled by default and opt-out.
CoinJoin Simulation looks very cool! At the least, it would be a way to greatly obfuscate transactions to casual observers. Would it have a side effect of making a user's 'older/aged' coins 'fresher/younger' for no significantly good reason, though? Older coins have an advantage of confirming faster and requiring less miner fee.
I noticed Samourai plans to integrate with JoinMarket. That sounds awesome :). The JoinMarket concept looks really great, giving users the ability to CoinJoin at will, or constantly on a per-transaction basis. It also lets users opt-in to earn small rates of interest on their savings, like a savings account. Will Samourai allow all these features?
*re: iOS, and 'other features'*
Is it possible to collaborate with another person/group on an iOS version?
Is it possible to collaborate in some way with Chris Pacia, author of Bitcoin Authenticator ( Chris is full-time with Open Bazaar and hasn't had much time in the last 8 months to work on his wallet, but perhaps parts of what he has developed can be useful to Samourai (e.g. OneName integration, 'extensible nature', 'decentralized 2FA multisig', etc.). It may be something to look into, it's on GitHub.
Anyway, good luck and thanks for your time. The enthusiasm behind Samourai is certainly palpable :).

Hi u/BalajiSrinivasan, please be aware there are many trolls (from r/buttcoin [although some have posted legitimate analysis about the 21 bitcoin computer -- may want to check some of it out], from altcoin subreddits [with ulterior motives], etc.), so pick and choose who you respond to carefully. Please don't feel obligated to entertain every single question, as every question may not be asked with sincerity. I'm hoping r/bitcoin mods will do a good job moderating the AMA (cc: u/bashco) to produce a pleasant experience. But enough of that, welcome to Reddit, and thanks for engaging with the community :).
This isn't an official AMA, but I guess also I'll also drop in some questions!

You're being extremely flippant and unrealistic, don't you think? Bitcoin is a global currency. Okay, maybe we don't need Bangladesh or Somalia to necessarily be able to run full nodes or mining operations, but major countries in the rest of the world should be able to do so. If a tiny fraction of the UK has access to 1/1 GBps, that has literally no relevance to the block size issue. The entire world needs to have, on average, a decent speed and last time I checked, it's something like 10-20 Mbps (and projected to grow at ~30%/year according to Rusty -- so nothing close to achieving 1 GBps in 5-10 years).

Because at the end of the day, what matters is XT blocks. "Support by a pool" isn't relevant, nor is DDoS of XT pools. To be clear, I'm obviously not condoning the DDoS (probably by people like Mircea Popescu), but I'm giving the reality. XT's mined blocks and hashrate is what matters.

Obviously it's a scam. I can't believe there is even a question about it. Why would you think someone wants to buy your bitcoin for 10% higher than market value? Please use some common sense.

Perhaps? I haven't thought enough about it, and/or I don't have strong feelings on that aspect. I think first priority should be a censorship-resistant network. The rest should probably follow after that.

Hi, I don't know if you know more than I do about what is actually happening behind the scenes, but I presume a compromise is actually being worked out? Gavin commented as much, that Greg and Garzik and others at Montreal had agreed with Gavin to get out a proposal that both sides can agree to.
At this point, a block size increase *of some sort* is necessary. Testing the patience of ecosystem players with words like "wouldn't expect any increases to happen short term" is not a way to endear them to Core, and to keep others on Core's side.
This actually only supports Hearn's blog post that Core doesn't actually about increasing block size, and that Core is only making public statements about it for PR reasons. I hope that's not true, and I hope you (and everyone else) understands this is not tenable. I also hope that Greg and others are actually working in good faith with Gavin to come out with a viable compromise.
If not, Hearn will be proven correct and his brand of extremism will win. And, likely, XT will experience a significant bump in adoption metrics. And/or, Core will be adopted with BIP 101, forcing a 20-year block size increase at 41% per year.
As an aside, I think block size limit needs to increase to at least 2 MB (like Garzik's BIP 102) very soon (within the next 2-5 months). We are already at 50% capacity, and Tradeblock's analysis of trends shows we can expect to reach block capacity by July-ish, 2016. To avoid that, of course block size needs to be raised. I don't know, beyond that, what *should* be done. I haven't taken the time to consider what the research says, or extrapolate the data out.
@_date: 2015-11-06 03:03:14
That means you have ~10% margin. I'd advise cashing out now, if you really must have 210 CAD. No point gambling and hoping it won't decline more than 10%.

When the moderates stop participating (as has undoubtedly been happening over time as the block size debate has raged on), the extremists will run the show.

Appreciate the pointer, but the above is 99% of the time the case. So, you'll forgive me if it starts to get annoying to see the same thing everywhere? But I'll try harder.
For example, I read so much criticism of Lightning, and yet misinformation is responsible for most of it. As another example, you said "5 year window", but Bitcoin does not need 5 years to address scalability, and is not planning on taking this amount of time? It's already being addressed (see material presented at past 'Scaling Bitcoin' conference and upcoming conference &amp; Lightning).

I used that word, since Brian's public statements always revolve around amorphous statements like " 'x' is the best we have seen". He does not actually get technical or explain reasoning. He just makes statements. He is literally dictating, as per the definition of the word. I'm criticizing that approach.
He also did the same thing with his recent statement on XT. He decided to publicly announce that XT is the best and that everyone should move to it. He completely did not care to provide any pros/cons, or well-reasoned arguments supporting it. Again, he "dictated", rather than trying to "collaborate" or "explain" or "make a case".
@_date: 2015-11-07 22:13:46
Here's a graph:


What's your point? There is hardly any correlation, and anyway it's not 1:1. With sidechains, the value is pegged 1:1. It's exactly the same value. And, there is no conversion fee the way there is conversion fee to go from bitcoin to altcoin.
And how are there separate miners? The idea behind merged-mining is that bitcoin miners will also mine sidechains.
So yeah, "bitcoin sidechains" are part of bitcoin.

Again, I understand the source of the irritation (believe me), but it's completely counter-productive to reply like that. It's actually better to say nothing at all (that way, you don't antagonize the other person and thereby 'create' a 'hardened' opposition that is even more resistant to the permeation of facts into their understanding).
I think 'RTFA' is pretty counter-productive too -- it's convenient Internet slang, where one doesn't really care for impact upon the other person. But, if in Bitcoin we're trying to all develop common understanding and move forward together, I don't see why we'd be telling each other to 'RTFA'.

I've tried to give Airbitz a fair try on iOS, but it's just still so clunky and unintuitive (and no SPV) compared to breadwallet.

u/bruce_fenton has tried a lot to "chime in", but last time he did, you mocked him (and apparently did not even care to include him nor Bitcoin Foundation in the dialogue re: 'Blockchain Alliance'). You also posted a naive/disingenuous response, by citing CryptoLocker &amp; honeybadger.
Gavin, I just want you to be perfectly clear about the fact that if you try to screw up Bitcoin (indirectly via naivete, or directly by being co-opted by Coinbase's pressure or whatever), it will be forked and an alternative will be used with order of magnitude more opaque and fungible block chain. No one here signed up for Bitcoin as a regulatory panopticon. The other Bitcoin developers are clear about the importance of fungibility and anonymity, and will fight to the death to achieve it.
Already, there are various alternatives backed by sound cryptography, like Monero. Keep on trying to mess Bitcoin up, and such options (or alternatives) will only snowball in popularity. Surely you know this is how p2p technology works? You try to neuter a technology, and it will simply re-emerge stronger &amp; more resilient the next time. The "genie" is long out of the bottle, and 'resistance is futile' (apologies for the cliche).

"Unfeasible" -- I'm guessing he means to run a full node and "participate" in the sense of being a full-participant that can set economic policy via full node and verify blocks
"lower limit" -- He is referring to the fact that, technically, we can support up to 16 MB blocks (in terms of block propagation speed), but economically we have lower limits (slightly larger than 1 MB) since bandwidth and disk space and CPU speed varies widely among those who run full nodes &amp; mine.
"not an expert" -- I think he's being modest, as a social convention, as are most good scientists when they discuss their work. He's certainly more of an expert than most other people, and is actually doing research specifically on the matter. He also has a very nice history of published Bitcoin research, and has been involved longer than most people (since 2009) as well as actually mining for 6.5 years.

Of course, it has to do with Bitcoin. Open your mind and don't think so small just because of your political beliefs?
Remember, the enemy of my enemy is my friend, or "the enemy (Sanders, theoretically at least when viewed politically) of my enemy (Wall St., specifically Jamie Dimon &amp; co.) is my friend (so Sanders can be a useful President, if he is so antagonistic towards Wall St. and its power and political control).
Remember Jamie Dimon hates Bitcoin, as does the banking system in general because it trashes their business model? If a high candidate (currently) for future President of the U.S. is antagonistic towards Wall Street to the extent that Sanders is, this can be a good thing to minimize their political power and ability to fight off competitive threats like Bitcoin. At the very least, comments like this should put fear into Wall Street, as maybe it wouldn't be the same old same old for them, and make them think twice before making statements so casually like Jamie did re: Bitcoin.
For that reason, this deserves to be promoted, whether or not you agree with his views or think he can actually change anything (I'm apolitical, personally -- I don't think politicians can really achieve anything significant in the U.S.).

And, that's b.s. -- Szabo is not a mere "authority". He's one of the most important people in Bitcoin's history.
It's also b.s. because if you think it's an argument from authority, then the onus is still on you (and OP) to actually argue why Szabo is wrong. Simply saying "argument from authority" is not an answer.
Btw, I'm not saying Szabo is right or wrong. I was criticizing in my original post the OP's clearly ignorant statement about Szabo. Szabo never said "75% consensus is a 51% attack" -- he said it's *like* a 51% attack, and he also said a lot of other things to provide context to that assertion.
@_date: 2015-11-16 15:54:44


I understand the "time-based cycle", but is there a reason why it's not "feature-based" instead? Isn't it wasteful for the official release to take so long to come out? Most nodes will only upgrade when there is an official release; they won't be looking to download and run an RC or use a PR, right?
Is there a good reason why it's not better to schedule releases (again, no need for 0.12, why not just 0.11.3?) based on features (based on: testing, importance, priority)? I mean surely the network can benefit right now from this PR, rather than waiting 6 weeks for the RC (which practically speaking most of the network won't bother with) or 10 weeks for the official 0.12.
@_date: 2015-11-17 02:08:17
The flaw is in believing the wishful thinking (or malicious intentions, if they desire centralization) of those who would claim that statement is true. In reality, it's not about keeping it "artificially limited" nor would it have "no effect or negative effect on decentralization". It's about keeping node/mining 'system requirements' contained to a reasonable level (not saying 1 MB represents that level, necessarily). This will help to ensure nodes &amp; miners can be run to a large enough extent in a diverse manner around the globe (as Szabo described it: it's about "policy neutral, independent nodes").
@_date: 2015-09-18 16:15:05
I guess it's possible that it's related to: the new forum these guys are using (forget the name -- maybe they saw this thread from their forum and brigaded it, with planning or without), or an alternate subreddit.
Either way, I expected it. I think it's a fair statement that u/theymos is really disliked by *MOST* people at this point. That includes even people who dislike XT. The seeming arrogance of the initial actions and the sticky thread ("even if 90% of r/bitcoin leaves, I don't care") has really rubbed people the wrong way. It may be wisest if theymos resigns or steps down from his position... or at least tries to genuinely apologize and reverse certain moves.
Anyway, I defended theymos in my post, so it was expected that I'd be downvoted. I didn't do it for the popularity though, just to try to inject a small amount of reasonableness and caution into the debate.
@_date: 2015-09-08 06:26:05
They all may just be being conservative, too. They may not want to mention Bitcoin because they can't guarantee Bitcoin will survive, so they want to hedge their words. Or, they may see negative PR with bitcoin among the public currently, so they want to be politically correct and not mention the word too much. Or, mentioning it might draw excess attention, so they want to use other terms and deflect that extra attention.
@_date: 2015-09-08 06:22:14
Supporting doubling the current size immediately constitutes 'larger', and so does doubling again 2 yrs later and 4 yrs later (= 40% increase per year). It's the same rate of increase as BIP 101, but starting at 2MB instead of 8MB. Adam is even fine with a 3-6-9 schedule. Honestly, Adam is probably the most practical and open to compromise among all the devs, though it's not a good situation since his preference would be to scale based strictly on security reasons instead of political compromises.

If this is true, and I'd like to believe it is based on what I know (or think I know), then why is it being allowed? I hope the wider ecosystem is not being utterly misled by it. I do hope people are taking charge, and doing something to prevent Hearn from running roughshod over Bitcoin, by engaging major players in all parts of the system (miners, processors, investors, exchanges, etc.).

I have seen a pattern of his behavior. He tends to do this every single time. Keep in mind the BIP 101 letter from a few months ago. That letter was worded in the same ambiguous manner, and as we saw later, it lied about having "mining support" -- to this date, more than 95% of mining hashrate is opposed to BIP 101.


That's bullshit, don't you agree? It's utter tripe. It means nothing. It does not explain reasoning. Its implication is: "Coinbase has decided we like this, so everyone else should follow along and do the same thing". What kind of argument is that? I have repeatedly asked Brian to explain his reasoning, but he explains nothing. Look at this posting history.
I also criticize it because we have an example of a company, BitFury, that actually has taken a technical approach to this whole debate. They are regularly releasing informative white papers that examine various aspects of Bitcoin. If BitFury can do it, then why can't Coinbase? Is Coinbase a "special" company that is not expected to do actual research and openly publish its data for peer review? Where did Brian &amp; Coinbase get the idea that the Bitcoin community will simply discard their own reasoning abilities and simply follow Coinbase like the Pied Piper? Basically, I find their public comments on block size to be really insulting to the Bitcoin community's intelligence.

Most people are not arguing for 1MB blocks (literally Adam Back made a proposal to immediately increase from 1MB to 2MB, increase from 2 to 4 in 2 yrs, and increase from 4 to 8 in 4 years), so this makes no sense.


LN is decentralized, not centralized.


Sidechains have zero to do with altcoins. In fact, Blockstream is developing sidechains precisely to maintain bitcoin's network effect by helping make altcoins obsolete (by allowing altcoin functionality within bitcoin &amp; using bitcoin's currency instead of altcoin currency). If you read Reid Hoffman's (the lead investor in Blockstream) post on the matter, you'll see it plain as day.
I think that because you're fundamentally misunderstanding a lot of things, you have the view you do. Of course if what you said was true, then you would be right.

What is this abhorrent witch hunt you're starting?
The person being accused (u/suonkim) of being an agitator is an 8 month old account. He is probably irritated that people aren't learning about Lightning before speaking about it. He was rude, but that makes him an agitator? He doesn't have a right to be irritated even though Lightning has been a topic of discussion for months now? Good luck then.
I can round up 90% of r/bitcoinXT sub with such criteria, as well as a whole host of recent newly created accounts on r/btc that have been recently making accusations.

He doesn't know anything, that's the problem. He speaks "from the heart" (that's his words), rather than his brain.

Now that Hearn has abandoned them to go work with the banks, they abandon their circle-jerk conspiracy-whisper (citing Jeff Garzik's lucid description, lol) of a sub (r/bitcoinXT), and come over here and to r/btc to spread the XT gospel directly and indirectly.

If this is true, what is to stop the Chinese government from lashing out against Chinese bitcoin exchanges (OKCoin, Huobi, BTCC)? In fact, Gyft CEO Vinny Lingham (so-called "bitcoin oracle") has recently said bitcoin still needs to crash one more time, before it will surge to new ATH next year. Why crash? Because he expects fallout from the Chinese gov's backlash.

Right, I mean *no parallel with "someone else of authority"*. I was referring to those 2 examples when I mentioned "this is now 
@_date: 2015-11-25 22:40:06


I see the irony, but isn't it dogmatic to take such a view? "by definition"
I agree though that censorship (moderation that involves deleting threads, deleting comments, banning users, etc.) *might* not be the answer, and instead letting free-market style approach peer-moderation (with heavier modding only when that free market approach noticeably breaks down) may be a better approach.


Devs in favor of larger block size were kicked off dev list? Proof? Which devs?
r/bitcoin censors opposing views now? Proof? I agree we have some heavy moderation at times, but by and large, I don't see explicit censorship of this nature. Also, you can complain to the mods through mail if you notice bad moderation, and it's fixed oftentimes (I know this, from experience).


And, likewise. That aspect keeps getting lost in this debate, unfortunately. I think everyone in fact wants the same goal (decentralized bitcoin, censorship-resistant, private, anonymous, flexible, extensible, etc.). I can't imagine anyone on any side actually saying they don't want those goals.
Thus, the only logical difference the two sides have is: HOW to reach that goal. It obviously needs to have all emotional arguments removed from it, as well as unsubstantiated arguments. It needs to be purely evidence-based, according to what is currently known. Anything that is not known evidence-based needs to be labeled as 'experimental/unknown'.
**A POSSIBLE IDEA (I would love feedback):**
I've tinkered with the thought of having some sort of web app that has lots of variables (aspects like: # nodes, mining centralization, block size, mempool size, tx limit, RAM usage, CPU usage, per-second bandwidth usage, monthly bandwidth usage, fungibility cost like tx size cost of integrating current iteration of CT, censorship-resistance... and whatever other relevant variables exist) coded into it (symbolized by a visual object, like different colored circles) and connected to one another by lines (like a web, or mind map), and as one variable is changed, the others automatically react &amp; change too (maybe become larger or smaller to help visualize the change, based on what we know of the relationships between all the variables.
By having a transparently available app like this (with all relationships transparently stated, along with evidence-based [data and/or logic] justification), one can simply start with the default current system... and then one at a time, change whichever variable is desired... and watch the effects of that change in real-time. It would be nice also to be able to bookmark a URL that automatically loads a custom set of variables' values (for easy sharing with others).
This would encourage "systems-level thinking" (and make it more easy to accomplish, since admittedly there are a lot of variables to consider in Bitcoin, and everything is interconnected, which makes it very complex), which I think is missing from the discussion. At least, this is what bugs me about the current discussion. Too many people in the debate, on both sides, selectively pick and choose only what variables they feel like caring about at any particular moment, and forget or choose to ignore the other variables.
I don't have programming knowledge to code such a thing (yet -- I'm in the process of learning), but if someone has the ability to code such a project and release it open-source on GitHub so that anyone in the Bitcoin ecosystem can contribute and collaborate to create a universal app for everyone to refer to, that would be amazing.

Uh, no. What makes you qualified to think you know best, and can credibly say that? Garzik is the same person, coincidentally, who voted in favor of opt-in RBF.
On a different more direct line of argument, I'll disagree because opt-in RBF allow a stuck transaction to be un-stuck much more quickly than the 72-hour timeout does. The two solutions are incomparable, and address different situations. Imagine someone sends a high-priority transaction without an appropriate fee, and realizes an hour later that it still hasn't confirmed. So, they can choose to re-send it with a higher fee, thanks to opt-in RBF.
Someone in this situation is certainly not going to wait 72 hours for their transaction to time-out; not to mention, the transaction would not time-out... it would just take longer than 1 block to confirm (maybe, say, 5 blocks depending how inappropriate the fee is and/or how much network congestion exists).

And when someone else takes their time to point you to actual information, it's like it goes in one ear and out the other, or you refuse to believe it and continue repeating your 'beliefs'.
I'm sure you're well aware that Lightning is an open-source project managed by at least 3 different groups (NOT just Blockstream's 1 employee -- Rusty Russell -- who represents Blockstream's only connection to Lightning), and that anyone will be able to run a Lightning node (once Lightning is ready).
And if you don't know that, then what the heck are you doing in Bitcoin land? How do you spend your time? Do you actually try to learn something, and read the information freely available on something called the Internet (check out google.com and try typing "lightning bitcoin" and see what comes up)?
If you do read, then for some surprising reason, you seem to continue to lie endlessly about "massive hub and spoke data center systems".
Why is that? Who is paying you to lie? I used to think that you were just "slow" and unable to process information, but now increasingly I feel like you're a paid troll. I say that because I, myself, am no one special (I'm not a programmer or highly technical), yet I find it effortless to find information and read it and understand it. Why are you unable to do the same? Only conclusion I can guess is that you must be paid to lie.
Also, to be clear, I am speaking like this to you because you have a long history of talking out of your ass. Otherwise, I am happy to help people who genuinely want to learn and find new information. With you though, I now think it's probably fair to assume 'bad faith' since this has been a regular pattern.

Yes, on the surface. But, there are claims that the top 3 Chinese pools are actually composed of hundreds of thousands of individual miners, rather than 3 block entities.


This is a 'meme' that is endlessly repeated, but it's false. I don't know why a false statement like this is propagated so much. We have at least 4 different implementations: Core, btcd/conformal, libbitcoin, and Lukedashjr (this is the implementation that many miners run, apparently).


I assume this refers to btctalk &amp; r/bitcoin. Both are operated by u/theymos, yes, but both have open and uncensored discussion, except for the topic "XT". Yes, even "XT" should be free to discuss, but having one topic excluded does not mean it's suddenly North Korea. Anyway, lots of other subreddits and forums have popped up since this drama, so there is no longer only these 2 places.


These are complex questions without simple answers. The clearer issue though is that as block size increases, full node requirements increase, and centralization will get *worse*. This is an undeniable fact. However, block size needs to increase to some extent... so it needs to keep in mind the centralization tradeoff while it increases.

It's a suggestion, you're right, but surely the suggestion is accurately portrayed as being anathema to the ideals of Bitcoin. Hence, does it not seem even a little bit odd that someone with Hearn's influence as a Bitcoin developer (and his major contributions, such as bitcoinj) would suggest such a thing? Tor Project core devs and other non-bitcoin cryptographers have opined on the matter too, and suggested it was at best a 'dumb idea'.
@_date: 2015-09-09 20:23:41
Not exactly true. DAH uses a *combination* of permissioned (closed) + permissionless (open). Whether DAH specifically uses Bitcoin as its permissionless ledger is not 100% known, but I would have said prior to this announcement that it was highly likely. Now, after the announcement (participation of 2 known bitcoin companies), it seems all but confirmed.

Yeah, but miners seem to be in agreement that fees are not a priority issue until sometime later (to help remove barriers to adoption in these earlier stages of Bitcoin's growth). In that regard, there is room for compromise between the two positions. We don't need 'free' transactions, but we don't also need 'longterm viability-type fees' right from the start. We can choose something lenient for the early years, and worry about fees more later on. Again, I'm saying this in spirit of mutual compromise.

I can only speak for myself, but there's no planning &amp; coordination of when/where to voice views. I think this is all natural.
We have two sides with strong views, so both sides think they are right and the other side is wrong. When the other side refuses to budge on their views, each side starts to think the other side is either: a) stupid, b) corrupted, c) evil (dehumanized). When this happens, as bad faith is assumed, the rhetoric starts to change and it becomes difficult for anyone *not* to be aggressive.
Remember, this drama has been going on for at least 1 year now. People are simply weary of it.

Only if your name is "Mike Hearn" and you refuse to work together as a team. The other developers seem to be increasingly happy to reach a compromise (as is pretty clear from Adam's message).
Scaling Bitcoin  was a huge success in building relationships between the developers and helping people find more common ground. I expect Scaling Bitcoin  to continue that success, since they will now be presenting actual scaling BIP proposals (and discussing, comparing, and contrasting).
@_date: 2015-11-07 21:21:11
Sorry, but this view is far in the minority. When one makes compromises, you don't look at the far extreme (your and Luke's proposals). These ideas of block size are absolutely a non-starter. Minimum is 2 MB, as Adam said. In fact, Adam has said he's okay with 3-6-9 too, if that will help compromise.

That's true, in a way. Even though I personally think XT is a very bad idea, I'm in a way thankful that alternate subreddits have appeared as backups, and similarly that everyone has begun thinking of how to decentralize various aspects. Even if XT vs. Core is not the real issue, this has provided a test run of how Bitcoin can react in the face of a real threat (such as government action, or VCs that suddenly decide they want a KYC/AML-ed Bitcoin network).

Adam, please keep in mind timescales, and assign priority as needed.
Bitcoin is no longer a small project limited to a few people. As we know, there are many more entities involved and interested in Bitcoin. With that reality, time management and decision-making *does* need to be efficient.
Coinbase CEO recently made a threat that comes into effect "second week of December". Of course, I disagree with his timing and his threat (in both respects, I think it's foolish). However, it is what it is, and I hope every single last effort will be made in the next 30 days to finalize, review, test, *and implement* a proposal (*any* proposal: 2-4-8, 3-6-9, or even 4-8-16, if need be), so as to head off the catastrophic implications and undermining of confidence that would result from the highly public clash that would ensue, if not.
When comparing costs &amp; benefits, I really can't see any net-cost at all to adopting a short-term compromise proposal. There *is* something to be said that decentralization may improve with greater adoption (the same % who currently run nodes can be applied to a larger number of users --&gt; same % = more nodes), which may occur with the positive press that is the result of resolving this issue (and the capacity increase).
This issue has really blown up, and taken a life of its own. Everyone wants scaling, and some want it faster than others. So, let's just get a proposal implemented before the deadline (or at least if Coinbase is understanding of it, get a firm date set that the proposal will come into effect), and then return the ecosystem to a more friendly atmosphere that is more unified and conducive to growth.
I'm growing increasingly concerned by statements from people like Jamie Dimon &amp; Blythe Masters, which suggests there are real threats in existence. A unified community would seem a necessary minimum precondition to effectively respond to such threats.

@_date: 2015-11-09 22:55:53
It saddens me, and I'm very fearful to admit that I suspect this is true, too. If you could distill everything that has happened, then it aligns with this.
Assume it's correct. Then, is it even possible to get the latter version of Bitcoin in a form that achieves a critical mass (not relegated to 'alt' style market cap of $5-15 million, maintains security a la hashpower, etc. of current Bitcoin), if we assume 'Bitcoin' is forced into the former?
If it's possible, then maybe all these issues can be solved very easily. A separate project, which is composed of the huge mass of developers currently working on Bitcoin to help it be what it should be (latter vision), would have more than enough technical talent to sustain itself. The question is only if it could attract mining hashrate, businesses (interested in the real vision -- e.g. wallet providers, exchanges, processors, Blockstream, etc.), etc. to help sustain it. Another question: how to solve issue of distribution, to make it fair and market-based (maybe clone existing blockchain's distribution?).
I feel like it *could* be possible, if you consider how Ethereum has managed to get a $75 million market cap, despite being a new project. And imagine if "new Bitcoin" had 90% of the technical talent of Bitcoin, then it would have even more credibility than 'old' Bitcoin. Not to mention, we don't even have to discard the name "Bitcoin" (we have r/bitcoin, bitcoin.org, etc.). In other words, some of 'old Bitcoin's' network effect could automatically be siphoned into 'new Bitcoin' (weakening old, strengthening new -- helping with bootstrap process). There are also lots of improvements (e.g. segregated witness from elements alpha) that could be incorporated from the start into 'new Bitcoin', which would make it superior to 'old Bitcoin'. Also, if it was seen by onlookers that 'new Bitcoin' has much better technical talent than 'old Bitcoin' and is superior in every way (privacy, tech, scalability, decentralization, censorship resistant, etc.), then I could even imagine lots of capital and investment flow into it... since it would have "credibility" and "trust", which perhaps are the only things that really matter (differentiates bitcoin vs. altcoins, and ethereum vs. altcoins).
It would be nice not to have to deal with the enormous quantity of idiots in r/bitcoinxt and elsewhere who have basically been brainwashed at this point (not even joking, see their comments and how they talk in r/btc's thread on blockstream --  comments/3s3u8x/our_blockstream_saviours_and_xt_infidels/cwu8o6i). If we don't have to waste time with all of that, since it would be a separate project fork, then life would be much more happy and work would be done more efficiently (purely dictated by technicals, not politics).
The more I think about it, the more I wonder if this truly is the best solution... not just practical and viable, but truly a great solution to all our problems. All it needs to work is to be coherent, comprehensive, coordinated, and well-planned. After such a fork, we will never again have to deal with this kind of nonsense. We can make it clear from the get-go that 'new Bitcoin' (latter vision) is going to be 'digital gold', with all the qualities inherent to that (anonymity perhaps with Zerocash or Cryptonote, fungibility, security, decentralization of nodes and mining, node incentivization, layer 2 (LN) for instant confirmations &amp; micropayments, etc.).

Let me give you an example. Look at the massively popular and successful Scaling Bitcoin  conference in Montreal. All of Bitcoin's top developers (and that includes Gavin!) participated there (Mike was the only high profile developer who decided he would skip it), and the vast majority of them are pro-Core. Even Gavin has stated his reluctance to lead XT or to abandon Core in the same way that Mike has.

I suggest we wait a week or two until Hong Kong conference is over, and see what the miners really think &amp; say &amp; do, as well as what Core devs actually propose and agree to... before making any decisions one way or another.

All facts, and all true. Thank you.
But Adam, please do make sure that Blockstream stays focused on its primary remit, i.e. 2-way-pegged Sidechains, as well as Lightning. Also, I hear Paul Sztorc has done extra work on 2-way-pegged sidechains, so please collaborate with him and get in touch. I hope focused development is not suffering as a result of the drama, otherwise perhaps hire a better project manager or Operations person who can keep everyone in line and strictly focused on achieving results.
Ultimately, the problem with Bitcoin is that people want scaling (as well as sidechains &amp; its associated flexibility and ability to run things like RootStock &amp; Hivemind prediction market &amp; Zerocash), but the technology and code is not ready. So, the sooner Bitcoin's code matches its hype &amp; expectations by community and investors, the sooner the drama will die. This is because really, no one cares how we get there, as long as we get there in a timely manner.
Thanks for everything.
@_date: 2015-11-10 08:06:27
Yes, but remember what Greg said, Adam! He had a positive, "strong" response to that question. He said he has learned to take it in stride, and try to be stronger. You have to assume that trolls (paid or otherwise) will be a normal part of life. They will want to tear Bitcoin apart, and incite hatred and encourage infighting. With that in mind, you have to be able to trust one another and rise above 'emotion' and discuss technical matters purely based on technicals. If a troll is detected, then evict the troll, and carry on. Don't worry too much what trolls say; let it slide off like water. What matters is what fellow developers and contributors say, and people who are clearly trying to act in good faith.
At least based on this video, and based off what I've casually observed, I think Gavin probably is acting in good faith.
Mike? Well, I really can't say that I think he is. His recent AMA cemented the deal for me. His words have become increasingly bitter, divisive, and destructive. He really needs to be forcefully separated from the project, and everyone needs to completely tune him out. Otherwise, he will continue to poison the debate. Of course, this is only my opinion, and I think people like Jeff have expressed the idea that he possibly still has hope. That's fantastic if real, but I think fundamentally Mike just does not work well in groups (and prefers to work solo).

Coinbase CEO (Brian) wants Bitcoin to fork away from Core to XT. He also wants Gavin to lead XT.

Key word of Satoshi's paper:


I already argued this point, saying bitcoin is a cryptocurrency and 'digital cash/gold'. The point is monetary sovereignty. Building a better Visa is really boring, and misses the point that Bitcoin is not merely a value transfer network. First and foremost, it is digital gold. This is the only reason bitcoin has value at $322, and is not currently at $50 or something. You should watch a video of what Wences of Xapo has to say, as well as Szabo's recent talks. Also, this is not possible unless, as Satoshi said, it's "purely peer-to-peer", aka decentralized &amp; trust-minimized &amp; censorship-resistant.
As for scalability being solved, a good method (aka, decentralized &amp; scaling by factor of 10,000x or more) is via Lightning.

Gavin &amp; Mike have literally expressed that they foresee Bitcoin's future, as being regulated and much more centralized, with nodes run by the major businesses (maybe a couple hundred).

No, because Sidechains and Lightning are both open-source technologies with everything laid out in the open. Anyone can develop them, anyone can run them, anyone can host a Lightning node (once Lightning is ready), anyone can make a sidechain (once Sidechains are ready). I see absolutely no financial conflict of interest for Blockstream, as regards these technologies.
Also, I just quoted Garzik's opinion on the matter. This should settle the issue, no? He was clear that the "conflict of interest" does not exist... and that such ideas represent "conspiracy whispers, groupthink, and derangement". That pretty conclusively should put to bed ideas that Blockstream has a conflict. Garzik has nothing to do with Blockstream, and has always been widely regarded as a neutral player.
I'm also very neutral (have nothing to do with Blocksream), and I agree. It is entirely personal to accuse Blockstream and its employees of lying and seeking to profit via their actions as Bitcoin Core developers. I feel offended every time I see such remarks, and again, I'm not even an employee of Blockstream.
When you say they want to limit the block size, why is it relevant? Garzik does too, as does Luke, as does Szabo, as do I don't know... so many different developers. This isn't remotely limited to Blockstream devs.

Don't buy, IMO.
Bitcoin insiders like Tuur, Ryan Selkis, and Vinny Lingam are expecting price to crash in next couple days, or within next couple months. No one in general in the Western Bitcoin world seems to understand why price is rising so fast. It makes one suspicious of manipulation, like pump and dump. So, may be a good idea to wait for a crash first. On the other hand, their comments may be interpreted as simply these insiders not owning enough bitcoins right now, and waiting for a crash because they have been caught blindsided by the rise in price. However, the crash may never materialize, if the rally is real. The rally may even accelerate, if people realize price is not going to crash or retrace, as they expect it to.
Price crashes much faster than it rises. Buying now, during a time of higher probability of price falling, means you have higher risk of buying at a top. Delaying buying means you have higher probability of escaping a price crash, and being able to buy lower. Suppose price does not crash, but continues higher? Then you may end up buying at a higher price, but there's higher chance it will be percentage-wise lower than the percentage you'd lose buying immediately and witnessing a crash.
You may want to wait for price to decisively break past $450, before buying. Perhaps even 10% higher at ~$500, for extra margin.

Unless... you are by implication saying you're totally fine with Hearn overruling Gavin in the event of conflict &amp; with Hearn's blacklisting philosophy in Bitcoin and Tor (which contradicts fundamental founding Bitcoin ideals by Satoshi and others *including* Gavin).

Yes!! I saw this same insight stated elsewhere recently too, and it's so correct. Only bitcoin can be locked to a smart contract, and allow the contract to be mathematically enforced with 100% certainty without requiring lawyers. The implications of this for future price is a good point. It's almost another use case for 'bitcoin the currency' vs. 'bitcoin the technology': bitcoin (and digital assets) *allows* for smart contracts.

Have you considered making it on-chain? I imagine you don't like that idea because of the lag time in confirmation. Still, there is the issue that you might get hacked if you are storing customer funds (changetip is off chain too but only since they deal with small amounts). Do you have security in place (multisig, cold storage, etc.)? It might help as an initial step to review how changetip operates in their situation: 
Bitcoin is amazing, but security is something that is uniquely easy to mess up with because of its 'digital cash' nature (irreversible payments). Please don't take it for granted, ensure your partners are also aware of it, and get help / review, as needed, from Bitcoin experts.

@_date: 2015-11-30 17:19:13


No, I do get it. I understand this fact, but aren't you giving them too much credit? In reality, isn't it a 2-way street? The big pockets buying bitcoins matter, but so do the miners &amp; developers. The miners represent a different form of "big pockets", and the developers are the entity without which Bitcoin (which is software) will not be maintained (bugs, security fixes) or improved further.
Developers also represent the "credibility" aspect of Bitcoin, in that people trust Bitcoin to hold ~$5.5 billion USD of value. Why do they trust it? Because of the conservative system of governance, and the respected developers with a long history of work on Bitcoin and in related fields. If you simply excise a majority of these developers (explicitly, or implicitly via alienation), you risk destroying the underlying "foundation" (of credibility). -- For instance, I choose Bitcoin (and not an altcoin) for these reasons. I have some sense of trust in the current Bitcoin developer system, and in the developers (technical acument, reliability, good intentions, etc.) themselves.
Satoshi intentionally designed the system to be very difficult to change, unless there is consensus (which will happen if a decision is sensible) between the various sides. One side can't just take it in a direction of their choosing, without risking major damage to the underlying.


FYI, I do, I am actually heavily invested, but these antics from Brian (and associated horribly faulty and unwise reasoning) are making me very nervous. I've become a lot more conservative in my position, in terms of being constantly ready to cash out to USD in case of crisis (with the freedom to re-enter if/when the crisis resolved).
But in case you weren't referring to me, let's not forget the elephant in the room, Satoshi (allegedly with 1 million BTC). Let's suppose, for the sake of argument, that he is actually alive and watching the proceedings. Let's say this heavy-handed attitude (of "economic majority is all that matters, F everyone else, we don't need them") is really that prevalent, and is the reason why Brian confidently says what he says, then it must be factored in that Satoshi might "give up" on Bitcoin at such a juncture (where it seems VC interests have trumped developer interests) and dump his coins on the market. Again, I'm not saying this is realistic, but it's not known that it can't happen -- so, it must be considered a possibility. Perhaps this can represent the ultimate check on irrational, coup-style actions.

Yeah, it's me again ("hello"), here to jump in when I see lies or hypocrisy (&amp; I despise hypocrisy even more than lies).


You're the one who decided to participate in the argument (hence opening yourself up to liability now), by commenting:


So, you're not valid in saying this now:


That's called 'hypocrisy'.
I participated in the debate between you and u/brg44, simply to clarify that your argument is false. You explicitly implied Blockstream is "largely sponsored by banking incumbents". This is false. Coinbase, on the other hand, which is active in promoting XT recently, *IS* sponsored by banking incumbents (among others).


This is a new argument, so I'll respond. Coinbase could hardly pivot, actually, without massively hurting its credibility and reputation. It is strongly centered around Bitcoin. If it switched in any sense, it would violate the form of 'social contract' it has created with its users &amp; investors (who wanted 'bitcoin'). Game over, in that event.
I feel like I'm repeating myself ad infinitum, but I'll do it again I guess:
Where is your proof or evidence that Blockstream "wants everyone to leave the use of the blockchain to the biggest richest entities and shift to layer 2 technologies"?
Without proof, allegations like this are defined as "libel", FYI. Outside a legal standpoint, they are also just intellectually dishonest arguments to make, and hence reflect badly on your credibility (reputation).
Put simply, a base-less argument is worthless (unless it's being used for competitive purposes: e.g. politically, to raise support for XT; financially, to raise divisions and increase success of fiat system; etc.).
End of story.

I think it's good to try to give every person the benefit of the doubt.
The other objections I have to the assumed narrative are: 1) Do we have evidence smartfbrankings is a Blockstream employee, such that what he says now is a credible representation of what Blockstream actually thinks?, 2) Do we know who is "profiting" in his statement, or how exactly he is defining "profit"? Maybe by "profit" he means "incentive", in the sense that a 'miner fee' is also an 'incentive' that works by allowing miners to 'profit' by providing a valuable service. So, maybe he means that having an incentive for layer 2 is a good way to encourage layer 2 development -- which is not a false statement.
We can't know answers, without giving him a chance to clarify what he means.

@_date: 2015-11-26 18:11:16
:). I was thinking the same things a few hours ago. I remembered reading your statement that it historically takes ~3 months on average for new soft fork to be adopted, but then realized the current 35% adoption is mostly of smaller pools (plus the always quick to the take, F2pool). Bitcoin's mining centralization then means we can jump from 35% to the finish line, relatively quickly!
Ah, mining centralization is bittersweet.
I'm very concerned about AntPool, though. They have increased their share of hashrate at least 50% in a very short period of time. I hope they are aware of the implications, and that a more decentralized mining network is actually in their interest (since it equates to perceived more secure network, which means price will likely be higher, which means they can still earn more $ even without increasing their hashrate -- although they'd earn less bitcoins, and so if they're holding their bitcoins like BitFury is, in anticipation of future price rises, then the argument becomes weaker).
@_date: 2015-11-08 00:21:24
Looks good. Let's poll every Bitcoin developer and get answers to these questions. You've come up with a decent list, now time to use it.
Mike Hearn just had an AMA, so maybe you should pose those yes/no questions to him, and get clear answers. Then, you can follow up later with: Your 'x' policy achieves the opposite effect to your stated answer 'yes/no' to question 'y'.
Oh, I should still say though that even with clear answers, there may not be simple development decisions possible to extract. This is because developers and large investors may feel one way... but businesses &amp; miners may feel differently, on some points. This is because these groups are perhaps more vulnerable to regulation and crackdown from government, and/or businesses may be relying on transaction processing (and maybe they see higher transaction throughput as a measure of success, rather than how much value people store in bitcoin). In such a case, the major parties must still be served. It's not sustainable or viable to tell one group that their opinion isn't important, and that Bitcoin is not for them. So, in such instances, some sort of compromise may still have to be made.
@_date: 2015-11-02 18:34:59


Yeah, this is the piece I was highlighting, to be wary of. Either this is true or not. If Hearn is lying about this, and he provides no sources to back it up, then my question is: why is he lying? Who does that?? Is he a compulsive liar? -- Or, if it's true, I'd like actual sources.

I find it hard to imagine that kind of rhetoric or belief system is going to help the "project" succeed.
I'd also caution you on throwing absolutes everywhere in your speech, when you lack concrete evidence to support those absolutes -- "absolutely", "no doubt", etc. -- these things are your opinion, unless I missed the evidence.

Sorry, but that is false. Garzik is on the side of Core, as should be obvious when only Gavin &amp; Mike have associated themselves with XT. Garzik has never associated himself with XT, nor endorsed it. Garzik resolutely instead has continued working on Core and participating with Core devs.
As far as Blockstream devs not wanting an increase, one of the top people at Blockstream, Adam Back, has proposed for a very long time now a compromise 2-4-8 (or even up to 3-6-9) plan. That means double size to 2 MB immediately, then double again every 2 years for 4 years... and then evaluating the ecosystem, before deciding what to do next.

"fraction of the cost" -- Again, I'd be more specific here, since cost is always a factor in determining the quality of an approach. And what I said earlier (100-10,000x cheaper) can probably be doubled, to 200-20,000x cheaper (varies depending how many BTC user wants to make private), since xmr.to adds yet another conversion fee to the equation.

The more I see this play out, the more it seems Satoshi's wisdom has been shown once again, with his choosing to design Bitcoin's system so that miners are given a large amount of power.
It is the miners, during this debate, who have (in some ways) provided a lot of the "level-head talk" and kept other parts of the system (businesses &amp; some users, mainly) in check, regarding prioritizing Bitcoin as a cryptocurrency store of value rather than only a payment rail.
Chinese miners have prioritized harmony among developers before making a decision, and BitFury and KNC Miner have prioritized data and research-backed positions (see BitFurty's white papers on their website, and KNC's blog posts on weboanza). Very wise decision-making, overall. 21 (4% of hashrate, thus small) has also been innovative via their efforts to increase documentation and their integrated mining chip (that they want to manufacture on a massive scale and integrate into devices).
But, mining has to be further decentralized and geographically distributed (top 3 entities control 54%... &amp; more than half of hashrate is located in China), to retain this very useful system of checks &amp; balances.

Once miners cross 95% threshold (if that's still what it is), then it will activate.
Wallets will update when they're ready, with many/most already working on it, or ready.

Is bitcoin a way to have enhanced global harmony? The process of making bitcoin a globally used currency and store of value can help people from around the world interact and learn to work together with common purpose, to help grow and sustain the open Bitcoin network. This is already happening with Bitcoin mining distributed around the world, and Bitcoin conferences (like Scaling Bitcoin  in Montreal, and now Scaling Bitcoin  in Hong Kong) drawing people and companies from around the world in unity to help solve problems.

Garzik's BIP 102 is meant as a backup option, that immediately doubles size (and hence, capacity) from 1 MB to 2 MB.
Garzik has also mentioned a mysterious "BIP 103++":


But yes, I've also come to believe that a 'block size increase' (or something that accomplishes the same) is an essential part of the picture.
Joseph Poon of Lightning Network recently said in an interview that Lightning will not be able to handle all transactions until certain controversial soft fork(s) are implemented, but those forks may not occur until longer-term. In the short-term, he said the soft forks implemented are only good enough for low-value transactions. I don't know what percentage of total transactions on average are "low-value", but it doesn't seem like Lightning is a viable option for the short-term, at least.
So, we cannot rely on Lightning to solve all our problems, especially for the next 1-3 years. Block size should be adjusted to ramp up accordingly to deal with that timespan.
In that respect, there's a separate proposal called "2-4-8" which doubles size to 2 MB, then doubles to 4 MB in 2 yrs, then doubles to 8 MB in 2 more years. Its originator, Adam Back, has also said he is open to changing it to "3-6-9" if that attracts more support as a compromise, or if it's backed by data to be better. If it were up to me, I may suggest something more granular, like 3-5-6-8-9 (changes occurring every 1 year, instead of every 2 years -- or maybe even a linear increase like in BIP 101 between the size doublings, to ensure size increases constantly over the time frame).

You really should stop posting (and tweeting) as if you are a mindless "BTC hard fork NAO!" zombie. SegWit provides increase in capacity via a safer soft-fork implementation (along with including many other improvements that lay the stage for further extensions, like LN, Schnorr, MAST, etc.); so, purely logically speaking, this is far superior to an increase in capacity attained via hard-fork, thus making a hard-fork redundant for the time being. You are certainly better than the common garden-variety troll, so it's about time to start acting like it &amp; behave with a little more maturity.

2. blockstream is corrupt and acting in its self-interest primarily (truth: blockstream is developing open source software that anyone can help develop and use, and doing so in collaboration with outside groups in the case of Lightning)
3. block size is being "crippled" by small group of corrupt Core devs (truth: 90% of Bitcoin developers AND miners AND nodes support Core and are taking this approach to try to defend decentralization, and are spearheaded by Szabo).

Yes. If there's wide consensus among the *technical* community, then I'm almost positive the answer is yes.


Uh yeah, I don't agree with 'altcoin' terminology, since it requires consensus. The criticism though is that 75% is not adequate as a consensus, that the limit should be higher (90% or 95%). The issue is not about 'hard fork'.

You realize that without mining support, XT is dead in the water? It means nothing, if miners won't support it. Miners have been clear they want Core to resolve it and that, without Core's support, they won't move. Saying "key figures support it" is evasive -- most developers who do actual work on Bitcoin despise XT and refuse it, and this includes Garzik.

People are anti-XT, because it is highly toxic and offensive. It takes decision making from a conservative consensus-based approach between many developers, and puts decision making in the hands of 1 person. This process will inevitably alienate tons of Bitcoin developers -- does that sound like a good thing to you? It's also simply a bad product technically, having already made various extra changes that are ill advised.
Also, nearly all miners are anti-XT, so consider that. Are they all paid by Blockstream? Szabo is anti-XT and has called it an "attack". Is he paid by Blockstream? Paul Sztorc of Truthcoin is anti-XT. Is he paid off? I can go and on, to be honest. I suggest you look at the bigger picture, instead of making emotional decisions based on the XT propaganda, and look at what figures actually support XT and what figures do not.


Subreddit mods have nothing to do with this. That happens by Reddit admins.


Again, Blockstream employees have nothing to do with subreddit censorship. And Luke sometimes has "extreme" opinions or badly-stated views that aren't explained enough or contextualized, but many others don't share all those views. So, why generalize?


What is worse? It seems absolutely clear to me that 1 person is worse than 1 company (and here, I assume it is true that Blockstream would have control -- which I completely disagree with, btw).

I think it's probably unfair to criticize Coinbase for following rules that the rest of the legacy financial system is compelled to follow. But, as Brian also hinted at, these kinds of objectively unfair situations ('adult entertainment' business is now a problem?) really highlight the growing incursion of the 'State' into citizens' private affairs, and reinforces the raison d'être of a censorship-resistant cryptocurrency like bitcoin.
I think we should all just take this as a learning example. It shows that bitcoin is something worth defending, and worth strengthening to become further resistant to national regulations (via increased fungibility, and decentralization of the network to ensure it remains resistant).

Bitcoin does not work like this, currently. Increasing block size will not do anything to help that.

I was imagining something like Thaddeus's and Joseph's failure bathtub:


In other words, the extremes can be dropped (such as: block size in Year 1 being less than 1 MB or more than 20 MB). Then, everything else in between can be a 'possible' idea (I'm not advocating taking the 'midpoint'). From those possible ideas, you can narrow down to something 'reasonable', such as between 2-8 (since 2 represents a mere doubling of 1 MB, which itself is going to be inadequate in a short 8 months -- and 8 represents the limit of what Chinese miners will accept).
The above are just some spontaneously generated examples of numbers.

If you don't disagree, then what on earth is your argument? If you don't disagree, then you acknowledge that "Blockstream Core" as you mischaracterize it is in fact simply "Bitcoin Core" (since development is already decentralized among many different entities collaborating to produce the end product, and largely *in agreement*).
Not to mention, we already have btcd and libbitcoin, which are true alternative clients based on the reference client (Core). XT seeks to change consensus rules and hence is not categorized as an "alternative implementation" -- XT (and Unlimited) represents the seeking of a hard fork, *unlike* btcd &amp; libbitcoin. I mention this point since you erroneously continue to include XT &amp; Unlimited in the same category as btcd in your image, and the image still has not been fixed to include libbitcoin.
*To make this latter point even more clear:*
**Core** = reference client (set of consensus rules)
**btcd + libbitcoin** = alternative implementations of reference client (follow same consensus rules --&gt; no fork)
**XT + Unlimited** = new contenders for the reference client (different consensus rules --&gt; will cause hard fork)

Seriously? Read what I quoted above. They literally do not understand Bitcoin, at all. Anthony endorsed this statement by one of their investors: "Bitcoin fails as Internet money" and "bitcoin isn't money". Can it get any more clear?
Meanwhile, intelligent people who have a clue, like Jeremy Allaire, say things like this:


Their entire premise and branding is as "cloud money", with BitReserve as the central entity (not even the Bitcoin network!), moving fiat with full reserve. No other CEO, neither Fred/Brian nor Jeremy, says such a thing. Why? Because they aren't solely clueless bankers, but also engineers and technologists who understand Bitcoin at a structural level.
You can also browse through the rest of this thread for evidence that Anthony is clueless about Bitcoin. And, if that's not enough, just Google "Anthony Watson Bitcoin" for more evidence of his cluelessness.
BitReserve has a long history of denigrating bitcoin, and they made it official with their re-branding to Uphold.

Where do you get this from? USD value (USD index is adjusted for inflation), over last 40 years, is practically unchanged:


And as far as US as a hegemonic power, it still is. There are rising powers, like China, but Middle East and SE Asia are not included. Middle East is powered by oil, which is in a deflationary period as massive new supplies of oil (shale oil and shale gas) have emerged, and as renewables like solar continue to exponentially fall in price and become competitive with fossil fuels. SE Asia is over-populated and mismanaged by their governments and hindered by corruption. Meanwhile, the US continues to lead the world with its diversified economy and remains the place where top talent comes to work, causing brain drain from other countries. And, the USD index reflects its standing. Even China seems to be messing up its chances to rival the US, due to its massive corruption and possible mismanagement of the economy (their debt levels have exploded higher by multiples, in the last 7 years following the financial crisis).

Bitcoin is like an early-stage company in pre-IPO. Most companies in pre-IPO stage cannot be accessed for investment by 'normal' investors, or those with small amounts of money. Only wealthy 'angel' investors and funds can access such markets. Because Bitcoin has no restriction in who can buy bitcoin and for what amount, even the poorest of the poor can invest into it at any time (such as 'pre-IPO', defined as before Bitcoin becomes mainstream). In that respect, the only barrier to investing in Bitcoin is ignorance (and/or risk appetite).

This sounds great in theory. In fact, I support the sentiment. It's not wise to have so much Bitcoin talent concentrated among so few developers. However, I think reality contradicts this Utopian ideal.
For instance, can you actually list a set of developers who can credibly replace the current Core dev. team (including heavy-hitters like Maxwell, Wuille, Todd, Wladamir, Garzik, Szabo, etc.), who are equals in knowledge about Bitcoin/Satoshi/incentives (and all the subsystems: cryptography, security, decentralized / distributed systems, programming, etc.)?
"Programming talent" is not enough to make one a Bitcoin developer. There is a massive array of knowledge required to properly understand Bitcoin and its incentive structure.
I don't think this high barrier to entry is a good thing, but sadly, I also don't agree that the Core devs are easily (or even with great difficulty!) "replaceable".
If a Bitcoin class was put together that *properly* created new pro Bitcoin developers, and you could actually point to a sizable list of graduates, then it would be a different matter.

But that's the thing, I think we already have reached that stage, and do already have "1-2 versions with the most support" (1 version in this case - Bitcoin). Except, it's being threatened because some can't work together and compromise with the majority's view. What I am afraid of is a fantastic thing being disrupted because of egotism. Bitcoin is not winning because of its name, it's winning because it has a devoted fanbase that is committed to improving it. How sad would it be if all this work ends up for nothing? If Bitcoin undergoes so much drama that investors are scared away, and price plummets to $100 or lower? Do you realize how much damage this does to 'confidence' and how important 'confidence' is, with financial assets? A major price drop would set back development by years (due to perception of it being a scam, or pump 'n dump).

Hey Charlie, keep in mind recent development in Lightning has realigned away from 'hubs' to the concept of 'nodes'. I think there are to be at least 20 hops between origin and final destination. There's also the concept of automatic re-routing, in the event that a node does not relay transactions, so it has an element of a 'self-healing' network. To incentivize it, there's the idea of 'negative fees', which incentivizes nodes by letting them charge a tiny fee in exchange for routing txs. Further, there is onion routing to encrypt metadata between each hop for added privacy from nodes.
There is also this recently update summary document:

The rest of the Bitcoin industry disagrees. Who is right? It's hard to believe Uphold is right.
Also, the $4.5+ billion of value in bitcoins also disagrees with the idea that bitcoin must first be a payment rail.
Wences also disagrees; he says store of value is first function.
Also, Bitcoin is already a payment rail, so what do you mean? The Bitcoin network is a payment rail all by itself... no need for centralized entities like Uphold to be the middleman rail.

But you know what? This is why I argue incessantly not to even censor the specific topic of "XT". Even though it can be rationalized by theymos, even the mere action of censoring "XT" alone is enough to give competitors ability to advertise their services and use the censorship as a recruitment tool, by claiming a moral high ground (regardless if true or not).
This is what both r/btc (via Brian Armstrong) and Bitcoin.com Forum are doing. Their recruitment message is: "You don't like censorship in r/bitcoin? Great! Then, come on in and join us. We "promise" (wink wink) that you will have Utopia on Earth with us."

I don't think it's backward. I think it's pragmatic. I think it's extremely dangerous to go with the assumption that we have a pool of developers with the requisite knowledge &amp; aptitude &amp; will &amp; backing &amp; credibility (to take over)... and use that assumption to support overthrowing an already established group of qualified devs. You need a failsafe, a concrete backup plan... otherwise, IMO this ("oh look our Core devs have been alienated and left Bitcoin for Monero, or for Bitcoin v2 or for ZeroCash! let's send out an alert for replacement devs to answer the call of duty! anyone out there who can answer this call?") is an unwise way to approach the situation.
In my scenario, the alienated devs will not have merely disappeared, but will join a new project. I think this must be taken for granted, as there has already been rumblings of such discussion going on in the background as people get upset (see: meni rosenfeld &amp; muyuu).
In other words, there will be a probable chain reaction of events if the "economic majority" thinks its all-powerful and tries to force the situation. Bitcoin will not gracefully change leadership. It will be very messy, there will be major disorder and fighting, and likely a strong competitor will emerge that is composed of the former Bitcoin devs (and it will be very attractive to users -- since alienated devs. will now have no incentive to try to create a regulator-friendly BlockchainAlliance-friendly Bitcoin, but instead a fully-private no-holds-barred style of cryptocurrency).

I am still the same person. Why is it not fair for me to have made that comment? Isn't it true? Look at that new thread made by hellobitcoinworld to complain about being banned. In that thread, the vast majority of comments are people accusing r/bitcoin of being corrupt Blockstream-ers who are either paid or brainwashed. wtf? Do you think that's actually true, and that actually applies to me (and all the others like me, since I'm not a special odd one out in this sub)?
If people in r/btc and r/bitcoinxt do not recognize there are plenty of people in r/bitcoin (like myself) who have 0 conflict of interest and *still* believe what they believe, then what motivation do people like me have to continue exerting enormous effort in being "balanced"? Do you realize how much effort it takes? It's so easy (and alluring in a certain way) to just go with the flow and not have self-control, and make sarcastic statements and mock the other side. When I normally control myself, I have to spend a ton of effort doing so (since I strongly believe based on my research and the arguments I've seen) that the Core side is in fact *not* corrupt, and *is* right in this debate. Well, mostly, although there is a very small minority that is impractical and thinks block size can stay static at 1 MB.
My comment included a fact (re: Hal Finney), and a sarcastic comment (joking about Finney being part of Blockstream &amp; Core). Is the sarcastic comment really that outlandish though? If Finney were alive today and advocating his opinion that settlement layer is the only way scaling can work, then I think it's highly likely he would be accused in the same manner as everyone else.
I admit that when I commented on this thread, I was very sleepy and tired and also frustrated seeing hellobitcoinworld's numerous comments with factual inaccuracies (intentional or not, I don't know), and I probably would have more self-control if I wasn't posting at such a late hour.

Actually, he had received the paper already. He received the paper, and then publicly tweeted about it. At that point, perhaps by accident, RootStock was forced out of stealth mode and began speaking publicly.
As for 'distribution still fair', you know it isn't :). The situation can be massaged to make it *seem* fair by relying on bitcoin's fair distribution, but when you have something like 80% of ether distribution occurring in a one-off pre-sale open for 1 month or so, then that's just absurd. I personally think this single decision dooms the ability of ether to be a legit currency. It simply can't be rationalized. At some point, if these things become 'bigger', they have to be rationalized to the public. Bitcoin can be rationalized, since it started off publicly available in a free-market from $0 and has been available in that same manner for 7 years. Ether? No way. Be honest...
Again, this is worsened because 80% of supply was in that pre-sale. And, this is further compounded by the impending decision to switch from PoW to PoS (so that those 80% pre-salers can become even richer via PoS) and rapidly reduce increase in supply.
I don't want to say it, but it's almost as scammy as Dash (75% of its current supply was pre-mined), except Ethereum is partially redeemed because of the illustrious history of its founder (Vitalik) and the good faith accorded to him. If Vitalik wasn't part of the project, I think Ethereum would be worth ~$0.

You're stretching this massively, no? Sidechains are not altcoins, for the reason u/bashco said, and that's really the end of the story. You can use trusted exchanges to convert bitcoin to altcoin, but there is a conversion fee. With sidechains, you peg bitcoin and convert to the sidechain's currency and there is no conversion fee.
As for Liquid, Liquid is a permissioned sidechain. How is that considered an altcoin? There isn't even a Liquid currency. It's just a way to quickly move bitcoin/fiat balances between exchanges.

It's highest quality for a number of reasons:
* Posters are diverse in nature and far more numerous than on r/btc
* Posters do not have an ulterior motive to try to constantly promote XT
* Censorship is not nearly as bad as you're describing (not bad enough to meaningfully impact discussion) -- the result of no moderation is you get crazy front pages like r/btc after opt-in RBF was announced.
* r/bitcoin has content of a technology-focused nature, while r/btc is highly emotional &amp; political in nature (again, underlying agenda of anarchism or libertarianism or XT)
Overall, I have spent hours on r/btc to try to give it a fair shot. It's a far inferior experience to r/bitcoin. It's fine though. If you like r/btc, then spend time there. Personally, I want the highest quality source of bitcoin info, and I think r/bitcoin still offers it (despite its faults).

As far as miners go, I think it's relevant to point out that BitFury (20-25% of hashrate) has endorsed Lightning:

Sure, and u/peoplma was not suggesting blocks hit the limit, either. u/peoplma, so Luke does endorse BIP 103, so we're clear.
Even with BIP 101 and other proposals, the proponents are not saying it is desirable or good for blocks to hit their new limits. Those limits are intended as ceilings, just in case demand temporarily spikes. And if it permanently spikes due to real usage, then the ceilings are intended as ceilings that are within technological limits (theoretically, at least).

If "not a huge dump" and "eventually" it will "all be turned to cash", then isn't everything fine? The concern is a massive liquidation, not a slow liquidation.
Also, converting bitcoins back to fiat (digital or analog cash) is the point at which people can be caught and traced, from what I've read. As long as they are kept as bitcoins, he can hide out and do what he wants. As soon as it's converted, he will deal with AML/KYC regulations and likely be tracked.


Bitcoins can in fact be used to spend online today, so it's not a real concern. The ways to do so are increasing quickly, too. You can buy gift cards with bitcoins these days, which expand the range of options drastically. I'm guessing he'll only liquidate small amounts for expenses that require fiat, via OTC to avoid tracking.
Anyway, the real threat is that he will be caught and his bitcoins seized. That is what may result in the real liquidation, unless they are auctioned off or returned to the victims.

Inevitable though, right?
Unless bitcoin becomes fungible (hence impossible to police), or unless the mining hashrate becomes significantly more decentralized (hence less likely for pressure to be applied), I don't realistically see another future.

Hmm, maybe you have a point, but a few issues...


If someone has shown themselves to hold positions that are completely opposite to that of the founding ideals, not just of Bitcoin but also of Tor, then how can you support that person becoming the de facto head of Bitcoin (via XT)? It seems foolish, as it seems inevitable that there will be a problem in the future. Why not advocate simply for BIP 101 on Core? I mean, if Satoshi returned and headed XT, I understand, but the opposite (for all intents and purposes) is happening with XT.


You say this, but if the XT drama has shown anything, it is that there is high resistance to switching (high switching costs), even if the alternative implementation 'solves' a supposed problem (providing a scalability roadmap). This is why I am so anti-XT and so worried. If the ecosystem actually did switch en masse to XT, then what guarantee is there that a future (in my mind, almost inevitable) XT with 'malicious' code will be policed carefully, and that node operators will switch away from XT in the event of an issue? Why couldn't public opinion just be manipulated in favor of the change? Isn't it wiser to maintain leadership of Bitcoin in the form of Core, which is headed by extremely stringent privacy and decentralization advocates?

Dimon is also misguided, since bitcoin does not actually threaten the USD.
Reserve currencies are relatively strong, and fiat can have its use cases. On the other hand, there are plenty of weak fiat currencies in use around the world that can become targets of speculative attacks, so if anything Bitcoin can be an aid for the US government to attack weaker countries that it does not like (via speculative attacks on their currency -- USD could be used for that purpose too yes, but BTC is a much more easily accessible currency and more easily hidden).
In fact, now that I think about it, Bitcoin is a dual-use technology just like Tor. It can be used offensively and defensively. The USG would be wise to support its growth and help fund it, just like they helped support &amp; fund Tor. As long as the US gets an early seat (via supply of BTC while it's still small), it would really benefit. It would be in its national interest from a national security perspective.

Hey u/3xploit (and cc: u/petertodd, so he can review these thoughts), can you please shed some light on this comment regarding mining centralization?


I've browsed some of your past comments, and seen what you've said. I guess I'm wondering, do you know what portion of pools actually hold their bitcoins rather than selling them, and what portion sells for fiat fairly quickly? As I said, BitFury recently indicated they hold all their bitcoins, as they have $20 million in fiat for operational purposes. -- I ask, in terms of: what do you think about my stated concern over Ant's rapidly increasing hashrate in recent weeks? Seems like going from ~20% to ~28%.
Is there incentive to constrain hashrate to something more alluring to outsiders, such as 20% or 15% or 10% (ideally!), with the idea that it would be a marketing point that the network is 'very decentralized' instead of 'fairly centralized'? Can there be coordination and discussion among major miners to jointly agree to something like that, such as keeping hashrate as low as possible (e.g. 15% each, or less)?
Can you think of any other incentives that would be helpful, from your vantage point?
At the end of the day, I think the more highly decentralized the hashrate, the more resilient the network will be, which means price will be higher... since value proposition of the network will be higher, and it can be used for more purposes.
Another thing I've been wondering about: Is there even a remote possibility that the Chinese government (which is fairly authoritarian) would decide to nationalize the mining hashrate within China, in the near-future or medium-term, supposing Bitcoin price explodes 10-100-1000x? Isn't it an additional reason to restrict hashrate from centralizing in any particular region? Or are there safeguards possible to prevent such a scenario?
These are difficult questions, but the sooner they can be answered (and the network 'fixed' to make it more decentralized and resilient), the better it will be for every participant (primarily via the mechanism of a higher price, which should easily offset any decreased portion of the hashrate). Imagine a truly censorship-resistant network, which means people can store their wealth as an off-shore tax haven, without any threat from gov. or regulatioin? The possibilities are mind-boggling. Price could increase by many multiples, if the network was extremely resilient, I would imagine. So, the tradeoff would seem to be worth it (less hashrate %, but much higher price/BTC).
I think Satoshi designed Bitcoin's mining incentives to imagine a competitive environment, but if, with the above understanding, Bitcoin's major mining players (including future entrants like 21, with its ambitious plans) collaborated to actively decentralize the network as much as possible, then it may be a win-win-win (miners, price, users).

Fair enough, but you can make a new post with an unofficial statement at least (your view), to provide a different perspective. So far, there has been little to no communication from BA, and those who have said anything (BitFury &amp; Gavin) have sounded very apologist and even perversely enthusiastic about "catching criminals" -- "criminals" defined how, and "catching" by what means?


This sounds like a 'talking point'. The issue has moved way part "libertarians and anarchists", as a result of Snowden's revelations &amp; Wikileaks. Now, it is a global issue of privacy as a human right (Apple even has led the charge), and protection from government overreach &amp; lies. Many otherwise-mainstream people have become sick and tired of the situation over the last few years, as reports have come out and conspiracy theory turned to fact.


That's one way to look at this, but bitcoin is also a cryptocurrency and thus a possible current/future store of value (see what Wences has said).
It's not possible to maintain the cryptocurrency aspect, unless it is censorship-resistant &amp; fungible. I like what your original post said on this matter, but BA should be making it clear (if that's how they feel). Otherwise, why should the community not fight back, and possibly fork if necessary to establish a more fungible bitcoin? Current bitcoin is kind of a privacy nightmare, and will become worse as companies continue improving analytics software.

I've pretty well defended the argument. If your sensibilities make you think that's not the definition of -- "immature, unprofessional, careless with facts, willing to slur major Bitcoin companies contributing a lot to Bitcoin's core protocol, willing to cause chaos among an open source project and against the will of the majority of developers and miners just to force his way, etc." -- then, I don't really know what to say. Maybe, you're not a good fit to be a team player and work on an inherently team project (like the Bitcoin protocol) either? I don't know.
Also, don't generalize for the sake of generalizing? These things can't be attributed to any other major developer (or if you disagree, feel free to provide supporting evidence like I did). I think Mike has been pretty unique in the breadth and depth of his bad behavior.

You're welcome, I hope they see it too.


What do you mean "no way to consolidate these small amounts"? Look at my previous message. Most likely, small amounts sent to you by different people over LN will all end up in your single LN address, consolidated by default. So, they wouldn't be 'stuck' as separate small amounts. And when you say "stuck in LN", to be precise, you would mean "stuck in a LN address", so it *does* have to do with addresses. A payment channel is the form of transaction used to transfer bitcoins between two users in LN.
Make sense?


So, I'm really confused by what you're saying. Lightning Network and Bitcoin Network are not two entirely separate constructs. They're different, in that LN uses LN nodes to process txs, while Bitcoin Network uses Bitcoin nodes. But, they're similar, in that LN and Bitcoin Network both use "bitcoins" &amp; both use "bitcoin addresses" &amp; both use "bitcoin transaction technologies" like payment channels, etc.


Since it's only 500 satoshis, and miner fee is ~10,000 satoshis, you can't transfer those satoshis out of the LN address to a normal bitcoin address. You'll need to wait for 10,500 satoshis.
But, the point is there's no reason to transfer them out of the LN address, since they are practically unusable outside LN (since LN has fees less than 1 satoshi, while Bitcoin on-chain has fees ~10,000 satoshis). Right? A quantity like 500 satoshis can only be used realistically on LN, so the incentive is for the store to just leave them there on the LN address.
In other words, I'm not seeing any logistical problems. If the amount is &lt; 10,500 satoshis, leave them on the LN address and transact over LN. If the amount is &gt;/= 10,500 satoshis, then feel free to transfer them to a 'normal' bitcoin address.

If you think you can do better, by all means go code an alternative Bitcoin protocol yourself. Don't try to disrupt people already doing work, though. Go learn C++ and whatever else needed and do your own unpaid volunteer work, then "clap loudly" and start pontificating on forums about 'decentralizing development' and 'overthrowing Core' and 'returning Bitcoin to the people'.
I am only a mere investor myself, yet I know my place in this hierarchy and am humble enough to accept it. Investors with disposable income and savings are a dime a dozen; genius cryptographers and coders who understand Bitcoin's protocol and incentive structure (and are willing to put in unpaid labor to do the work) are not.

It is a "real" increase in housing cost of 29%, and even that could simply be due to supply/demand differences (including due to speculation, as people abroad increasingly want to move to the US or see the US as being a good place to invest). Ounce of gold is not relevant, since gold price is subject to speculation, or maybe gold has found greater use in industry or jewelry since 1975. Gasoline apparently has a "real" decrease in cost.
You have to adjust for inflation, since prices may have increased but so have incomes. People aren't earning what they used to in 1975.

Thanks. What you said is practically true, but be careful how you frame it and what words you use. The important distinction is that layer 2 does not mean a certain person or company will profit. It means that layer 2 needs some incentive to be developed fully or in a timely manner, i.e. something akin to a miner fee (an insignificant financial incentive that spurs development).
In the case of Lightning, if the result is a system that scales by 10,000x without increasing block size by 10,000x (rather with 200x), then bravo.

Read the 2 sentences before that. Full nodes do not translate so cleanly. Each full node has many connections to other full nodes, and to SPV nodes.


I mentioned 'argument from authority' in a sarcastic manner. Some people abuse that argument. I don't think it's a legitimate argument. Of course the person suggesting something matters. It doesn't mean the idea is automatically great or horrible, but a more accurate picture can be gleaned by also considering the person as well as the idea. It also helps triage ideas. There is limited time in the world, and prioritizing what to look at based on the person is a way to be more efficient with time, even if it's not ideal.
Anyway, back to your argument, I mentioned the people behind the BIPs, not to give them credibility but purely to give extra context to the reader. Don't read into it. I think it's useful to show how various figures are actively working on scalability, contrary to popular notion.

@_date: 2016-10-26 07:18:22
Your fee would be okay normally, but there was an abnormal surge in transactions today, so it is taking longer for the network to process the extra transactions. The hash rate of miners also fell at times today (happens randomly, is part of Bitcoin's "Poisson" design), which causes the network to be able to process fewer transactions than usual. Together with the extra transactions and the slower network, we have longer time to process transactions.
See here:


Your fee/size (satoshis/byte) was about 55 ( so you can see in the chart how many transactions paid a higher fee rate, and thus have higher priority.

Yep, but this is why those with an awareness will be fine ultimately, either via bitcoin/gold, or via other assets (stocks, etc.).

10% of nodes = meaningful node support?
"slush pool"? The real question is how many XT blocks? 1 in last 1,000 = meaningful mining support?
Gavin &amp; Mike = meaningful developer support?
Come on, get real. I don't know what you're trying to show by saying this. It is a 10:1 ratio in nodes, a 1000:1 ratio in mining, and a 100:1 ratio (at least) in developers. In the last 1 year, XT has achieved virtually zero traction and agreement by the wider ecosystem.

Size hasn't been determined yet. Scaling Bitcoin  in Hong Kong is meant to showcase the community's proposals, and then figure out which one/ones is/are best and why. An idea has been to pass one short-term proposal (to immediately raise cap to at least 2 MB) and one longer-term proposal (something that changes scaling calculus to allow long-term scaling -- e.g. flex-cap, bip103++, etc.).

You're really spinning this, hard.


I gave my opinion that it was clunky and unintuitive. You counter by saying it's the most mainstream user-friendly wallet. You know, you claiming that is "is" that, does not refute what I said, or automatically make it what you said. Your response is a non-response, in other words.


SPV has a single definition, and it either is SPV, or it is not. There is no "depending on your definition". Airbitz is *not* an SPV wallet. SPV is a massive advantage, since there is no server to go down or get hacked or spy on a user's payments. From a security and privacy point of view, there is no comparison.


Again, I thoroughly went through the wallet and have tried to use it. It is far from "user friendly". Breadwallet is completely clutter free and easy to use, and automates fees, etc.
It's odd you say it's the only app worth recommending to "new" people, but then you also say it's "far more powerful and useful". Something simple, like breadwallet, would be the optimal thing to recommend to new users, not "something powerful".
Anyway, I'll just end this comment by stating that breadwallet is far more "silky smooth" and "snappy" to run. If you can get Airbitz to actually improve to match breadwallet in that regard, then I'll be able to change my opinion... but don't try to position Airbitz in a way that does not reflect reality, please.

I'm going to need you to clarify some things, if we're going to have this debate.
* *"undermining a public debate, and underhandedly pushing a certain ideology, while at the same time asking for more time"*
What do you mean "undermining"?
"pushing a certain ideology"? (again, when most developers and thought leaders say this "ideology" is what is sensible, then I hardly think it's calling pushing an ideology)
"asking for more time"? (how is this controversial? we need ideas that are well-tested. even bip101 recently FINALLY got around to doing testnet testing, just proving the fact that no proposal is well-tested yet)
* *"I'm talking about procedure. The devs can not sign an open letter asking the community to give them more time so that they can come up with a "consensus", set up a voluntary time table, chosen by themselves, with an implicit deadline of December, only weeks away, while at the same time completely bypass the consensus process"*
What "completely bypass the consensus process" are you talking about?
As for this:


Satoshi wanted a "purely peer-to-peer electronic cash" and he defined 'p2p' as being like "Gnutella and Tor". This is impossible with a network of high requirements for miners/nodes, as it would naturally be more centralized. To have a real p2p network, you need to keep the system as efficient as possible. And, this becomes possible with a model of: layer 1 / layer 2.
I don't see what the problem is? If we can have scaling with Lightning and other layer 2, then what is the issue? It seems like endless hand-wringing over nothing.
21 recently endorsed this 'payment channel' approach (used by Lightning). And, even BitFury recently endorsed Lightning, FYI, so please don't bring up the recently popular argument I've seen, of: "oh no, but miner fees are being taken away, so Lightning is bad":

I appreciate your right to your opinion... but in such a case, my opinion is it makes more sense to defer to the main Bitcoin protocol contributors / researchers consensus expertise instead, as far as what sized block is "conservatively larger". A lay person like yourself (or myself) who does not spend all day working on the protocol and thinking about the tradeoffs inherent to making any decision is not well-versed enough to know what constitutes a conservatively-larger block.
Btw, keep in mind that SegWit is akin to about a "1.75 MB" block size increase (and yes yes, wallets must also update for the user to see the benefit, but most wallets are already on board, and the remaining holdouts are large centralized wallets for whom migration is technically trivial). So, with SegWit implemented, even the view of "conservatively larger blocks (2-8MB range)" would have to be divided by ~1.75 (1.14 - 4.57 MB), in order to remain consistent :).

Since when do majority of devs and miners support going to 8 MB immediately? Produce evidence. I have seen no major dev nor mining support for this. If you look at how miners are voting, hardly any support BIP 101. Those that support 8 MB want a single increase to 8 MB; they're not supporting going to 8 MB, and then keep increasing at a high percentage every year.

The point you miss is that Bitcoin is *not* supposed to be purely some sort of Visa replacement. It is, first and foremost a **cryptocurrency**, a censorship-resistant store of value (i.e. digital 'gold', or electronic 'cash' as Satoshi describes it) that provides monetary sovereignty (private money, rather than public money connected to any particular government). Have you forgotten this? Your post seems to completely forget this aspect.
People say we need to follow Satoshi, but Satoshi cited central banking's failure and bailing out of banks (i.e. failure of fiat, *not* failure of Visa), as his motive to create Bitcoin. Satoshi also wanted to create a "purely peer to peer electronic cash". Bitcoin has not been designed for banks to use it as their tool to move fiat. I mean, really, who cares what systems banks use, how does that *really* matter? It's nice if utility can be maximized and more functions possible, but that was not the primary reason why Satoshi created it.
This doesn't mean we shouldn't also try to scale Bitcoin, but it has to be done carefully. It doesn't seem you understand the importance of doing it 'carefully', based on this statement: *"I doubt this architectural change will ever happen if we can’t even agree on a simple algorithm to raise blocksize"*. It's not a "simple algorithm"; if it was, we would not have so much debate. It has to be considered in a way that keeps the network decentralized.
The point of things like Lightning Network is also to allow "real" scalability on the order of 10,000x (as you mentioned in the post, block size isn't really going to solve the problem in a significant way), while also keeping the network decentralized.
See BitFury's recent statement on Lightning:
*  ("enter lightning 10000X Visa coming up.")
With respect to OpenBazaar, OB is not interested in providing privacy to its users: no Tor, no nothing... so I wonder how much value they will bring, if they are already compromising on principles, in order to appease mainstream.
But back to the issue of how it will handle Bitcoin not being scalable, that's a good question. I imagine Lightning will have to play a major role. If Lightning is estimated to take another 12 months to be rolled out, and we couple it with a stop-gap blocksize increase (a 2-4-8 MB plan over 4 yrs has been mentioned a lot -- and even those numbers are not set in stone for the purpose of debate) in the mean time, then maybe such a combo will do the job.
We are at 50% block capacity right now on average, so doubling capacity in the next 3 months (to 2 MB) will put us at 25% of capacity. Based on Tradeblock's analysis of trends, this means we would rise to about 40% of capacity by July 2016. By then, we should be able to expect Lightning's arrival, which will at the very least help offload those transactions of small value (small value, because it won't be secure enough to handle large value transactions until longer-term malleability soft forks are deployed) from on-chain to LN.
I'm not sure what percentage of transactions are of 'small value', but I imagine it's a sizable number (anyone have statistics?). So, we can estimate for the sake of argument that maybe, assuming 50% of transactions are viable to be transacted over LN instead, we will then be utilizing 20% of capacity (or lower!) with the advent of LN. Placed on such a trajectory, we would then double block size to 4 MB in 1.5 yrs (early 2018), and double again to 8 MB 2 yrs later.
These are just attempted estimates.
Let's wait for Scaling Bitcoin  in Hong Kong to see what scaling proposals people announce and the specific numbers.

I'd hardly classify this as an 'off-hand comment'. He's one of the few who was allowed to review RootStock's white paper, and commented thusly (informed opinion) after doing so.
I also made no claim of it being akin to 'personal doctrine'. Szabo just I think realizes rightly that Bitcoin has the network effect... and the 'fair' market based PoW distribution over 7 yrs vs. Ethereum's presale-based 80%-of-supply-in-one-go distribution.
@_date: 2015-11-07 21:59:01
You need to correlate actual demand vs. supply. Actual demand states block size usage will hit 'capacity' by mid-2016 with 1 MB. This means doubling it to 2 MB will extend that date to at least mid-2017, and perhaps later. See TradeBlock's research.

If I remember correctly, Luke endorsed BIP 103 ( That's the 17.7% proposal you refer to. What's wrong with it? I looked into its source for "17.7%" back when it was released, and it looks quite legit to me. Cisco looks at *actual* end-user broadband usage and estimates for increases over next 5 years. They estimate 17.7%. If it's too low for you, then that doesn't change that it goes by seemingly legit estimates, right? I don't like how low it is either, but it is what it is...
This is why block size-based scaling is kinda not sustainable (and why things like Lightning are so critical! I'm actually concerned that we will never be able to scale Bitcoin properly if Lightning does not end up working.), at least if we want to keep Bitcoin a decentralized cryptocurrency that will resist [Jamie Dimon](
And what's wrong with BIP 102 that increases to 2 MB? It's not meant to be a terminal solution. It's just a stop-gap measure, until we can figure out next time what to do. It doubles capacity and lets us move on until at least mid-2017, I estimate.


I agree we have limited block space. But a fee market is essential? Without a fee market, miners will not get compensated for the halving coinbase rewards. At the same time, block size needs to increase, yes. My point is I think fee market is essential: 1) to hinder spam attacks, 2) to ensure a sustainable system for miners. Either we have a legit fee market, or we remove Bitcoin's 21 million cap and have some sort of never-ending inflation rate (e.g. 1%/year forever).


When certain users get priced out, then other users are more than compensating by giving higher fees to miners. Miners lose insignificant fees (by nature of how it works), and gain much larger fees. Where's the issue?
Also, remember my point that good wallets will auto-decide fees. The ideal situation is that real demand will always be accommodated, while spam will be hindered.
Also, remember that those users paying lower fees will still likely get their transactions confirmed -- they are only prioritized lower, and wait back in line. This seems fair to me, and sustainable. Pay more if it's a priority, otherwise pay less if time matters less. In no situation will lower-fee mean not getting to use Bitcoin in a absolute sense.
Block size and other scaling methods all need to occur though of course to let the system scale to real demand.


I don't know enough, to respond to this. What you said sounds kinda logical... so not sure what to say. Can you pass that question on to someone else?


You're assuming that "build it and they will come" is true though. China's ghost cities have shown it not to be true, in the real world. Back to block sizes, the main issue is not scaling. Everyone wants to scale. If we could change block size to allow infinite capacity, wow, let's do it! The problem is how it affects sys requirements for full nodes, as well as miner requirements.
We already have a vibrant system right now, with lots of competitors in mining. Even 21 is getting into the game, and trying to decentralize mining via their integrated chips, and BW has announced 14nm miners for the public to buy. BitFury has also mentioned they are working on something to help decentralize mining (though I'm skeptical).
Anyway, mining centralization is a complex problem, and I don't believe there is an easy answer. An idea I can imagine is that when we have easy access to free electricity, in an age of abundant energy such as solar on every roof, then mining will be more democratized.

Sure, the more the merrier, but XT is promoting consensus changes, so it's not a fair comparison.
I think more in line with what you want (decentralized dev) is "libconsensus", as well as libbitcoin and btcd (conformal).

Because he has had this same pro-XT position since the beginning. I specifically asked u/bdarmstrong a question. It wasn't an invitation sent out for XT to come brigade the post and start debating me.
I want to know what exactly is going on in u/bdarmstrong's mind, that he would choose to do something as drastic as he is doing. Has Brian attended the Scaling Bitcoin conferences? Is he actually interested in scaling Bitcoin, or is he rather mainly concerned about the governance coup aspect of XT, whereby control centralizes in a single individual (Gavin)?
It seems to me (he can correct me if he is wrong), that he is solely interested in XT not because of scaling, but because he can get rid of the other Core devs and basically co-opt Bitcoin as a result, since Gavin is a compliant individual who is already an Advisor to Coinbase and will do whatever Coinbase wants. In other words, it seems Brian wants Coinbase to take over Bitcoin, and is not interested if every other Bitcoin developer leaves the project as a result of the centralization of control with "Gavin as final decider".

I have you tagged on Reddit as someone who at one point posted intelligently. So, I'm curious why you feel this way. Can you summarize your argument in 1 or 2 sentences?


Isn't it undeniable that R3 views Bitcoin as competition, and hence will attempt to hinder or block its growth, or at minimum co-opt it for its own benefit? R3 is composed of the 30+ largest banks in the world. The largest one, JPMorgan, recently was in the news with its CEO, Jamie Dimon, saying this about Bitcoin:


Still, when I mentioned "R3/Coinbase XT", I was not saying I think it should be used. I was commenting on u/peter__r's insistence on using the term "Blockstream Core" as propaganda, and saying how it would be fair to respond with "R3/Coinbase XT". I think it's inappropriate either way though... especially in the case of "Blockstream Core" (for numerous reasons).


What is there to "agree" with? It's a fact, isn't it? What I am saying is nothing about "beliefs".
BTW, Peter Todd supports FSS RBF, but did not include it because of pushback from wallet developers. See the opt-in RBF GitHub thread.


Nope, I mentioned Coinbase because Coinbase pays Gavin as an "Advisor". XT is led by two people primarily: Mike &amp; Gavin. Mike is employed by R3 now, while Gavin is employed by Coinbase (and MIT DCI, but that's less relevant here, since Wladamir is also employed by MIT DCI). Further, Mike had the 'benevolent dictator' title, with XT policy being that Mike makes final call if there is disagreement with Gavin.
This is why I used the term "R3/Coinbase XT" (with R3 positioned first in the order).
Make sense now?


Sorry, this sounds really naive :(.
Look up R3, their members, their task, their comments about Bitcoin, etc. Especially, note the above video showing Dimon's comments, since JPM is likely a highly influential member of R3.

People in power who have made up their minds would not be expected to be interested in alternative views. And attacking dissenting voices is a natural response (to try to tamp down the criticism), when the BA wants their viewpoint promoted.


Seems a view that is either very government-centric, or more generally a view centric to those in power. It's easy to smear the other side as "libertarians and anarchists", rather than take the nuanced view that it's far more complex (Apple, Snowden, Wikileaks, DuckDuckGo, Tor, etc.).


Is it possible that "won't help Bitcoin go mainstream" has a kernel of truth, in that regulators will otherwise try to shut it down or hinder it?
I recall two things: a) Jamie Dimon's statement at Fortune regarding DoJ &amp; Bitcoin, b) Blythe Masters talk at Bank of England's conference where she and the rest had the view that there is a history of new technology being co-opted by governments and corporations for their own use ("people thought the Internet would be for freedom, but now look at how government has view into every person's life" -- literally this example was given by one of the people during the conference).
In other words, perhaps the idea is DoJ (referring to Dimon's threat) will only allow it if it's regulated in some fashion (referring to Blythe's and the others' comments). Maybe that's the bottom line, and the unspoken truth behind these events?
@_date: 2015-11-07 19:32:05
Agree with the first argument.
Disagree with the second argument (re: altcoins). 99.9% altcoins are purely a scam and intended to enrich the altcoin's creator. Thus, I think it is safe and prudent for r/bitcoin to continue blanket banning all altcoins. If someone wants to discuss a certain altcoin, it's very easy to do so in that altcoin's subreddit.

I think Trace should ask this question to every Bitcoin developer and large investor.
This includes people like Wences of Xapo. Wences has been very clear in his advocacy that [Bitcoin is "digital gold" and "censorship-resistant"]( to people like [Jamie Dimon]( (in fact, check out who retweeted and talked on Twitter about Jamie's statements, and it may be a clue as to who actually believes in Bitcoin vs. who sees Bitcoin as merely a better Paypal that will ultimately be regulated and subjected to AML/KYC: what I noticed = [Marc Andreessen]( Jeremy Allaire, [Wences]( [Ted]( [Rogers]( [George Kikvadze]( of BitFury, [Meyer Malka]( of Ribbit Capital, etc.) and he has invested large amounts for this reason (as well as advocated it to his other wealthy friends on that basis). Yet, Xapo and the others seem to go along with the herd of industry in many of these debates, etc. It seems dissonant, no?
If large investors had this question posed to them, and we could clarify the starting assumptions, then I think the entire Bitcoin ecosystem would be much more coherent about what is truly important (and the BIGGER picture).

That doesn't mean I think he's corrupt or paid off. He is just his own person, and has his own ideas on how to moderate. On balance, I think he is acting in a way that he thinks will benefit Bitcoin most (which is where the 'heavy handed moderation style' comes into play).

Hi Paul. To reply to this point, Wences recently said in an AMA that he estimates globally there are currently 12-14 million Bitcoin users. I'm not sure if he elaborated, but I don't think so.
Also, keep in mind some 'users' can be holding bitcoin in bitcoin banks (so not visible individually on block chain).
Also, users don't necessarily have to be holding 1 BTC each. Each user gets involved as he/she wishes, maybe as little as $5 or $50.
Also, I don't think 'active' is a good metric, since one must consider the 'digital gold' store of value use case, or simply 'speculation' on future value. Active users are great, but it shouldn't be a metric in determining the validity of users.

[LN]( is being [developed as we speak]( and the sheer magnitude of possible Bitcoin use cases have been enumerated (e.g. see here:  and some already put into practice.
And those are only the use cases we have thought of right now, remember. The open protocol nature of 'Bitcoin' means use cases are practically unlimited and, due to its permission-less &amp; restriction-free nature, use cases are only limited by one's imagination and ability to execute. This means there is low barrier of entry to actually implement the use cases and design new products and services around the Bitcoin protocol, and low barrier of entry = a higher likelihood of services arising.

Mike Hearn is the only person who has refused to back down or compromise.
And, if we have people on Core side who lack pragmatism and refuse to compromise for the greater good, then I predict such people will unfortunately also have to be marginalized (just like Hearn through his behavior has ended up marginalizing himself -- Notice Brian Armstrong expressed desire for *Gavin* to lead the XT fork that Brian wants industry to adopt, not Hearn).
If there is a choice between Bitcoin continuing on and growing vs. Bitcoin imploding catastrophically, then to me at least the choice is very clear. I predict most people are similarly pragmatists, rather than ideologues.

Imagine if all transactions worked this way, so that by default, if a transaction wasn't confirmed in "x" minutes (where "x" is an optimal number that satisfies 99.9% or whatever of cases), then it would "time out"... letting the user have a chance to send it again, and perhaps choose a higher fee next time.

Hey Jeff, doesn't BitFury's paper state delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) like Slasher, BitShares, Casper may have merit, but that there isn't enough data yet to be sure? BitFury only seems to conclusively state that 'pure PoS' is flawed, but reserves judgement about DPoS.
I ask because, as we know, mining is horribly centralized and vulnerable to government coercion or compromise... and worse, no one seems to know how to fix it. If a DPoS system is found to be superior, then it would seem to make sense to migrate Bitcoin to such a system.

No problem! Are you active on bitco.in or some such forum? I wouldn't mind (I've love it), if you started a thread on this very important issue and even put my post there to start the discussion. We need lots of ideas on this and back 'n forth discussion, in order to reach a solution... and I haven't seen the discussion happen anywhere.


Yeah, it's unclear to me too. Likely some sort of 'disruption', but not sure what exactly.
By the way, the only progress I see being made in this area of 'increasing cost of attack' is 21. If they are truly altruistic and really want to decentralize Bitcoin by spreading 21 node/mining combo chips to the masses, then that may solve the problem very nicely. Their current product is $400, but cost to build is estimated at $250. If they can bring their price down closer to build-cost, and really market the heck out of them, then maybe we can widely distribute these and have hundreds of thousands (or even millions) of nodes and decentralized hashing power.
@_date: 2015-11-04 06:01:20
Interesting, thanks for the info!
But, don't you think he's unnecessarily discounting speculative value? $200 and lower represents break-even for mining, but what about people wanting to buy bitcoins, either to store value or to speculate on future price (that is based on people storing value in it)? With increased user adoption, or simply change in sentiment among existing 13-15 million users (according to Wences), it seems price could be bid up far beyond $200/400.
Another thing. Did he comment at all on the recent price run-up?

@_date: 2015-11-25 20:11:26


Yeah, perhaps. It represents a 'hard fork'. I think people sometimes describe it as an altcoin because if it got 75% vote, then current Bitcoin would no longer exist. So, it's sort of like an altcoin taking over (except it's not really an altcoin, but rather 'new Bitcoin' since it would replace current Bitcoin).
On that line though, it's also non-neutral to call XT a way of "decentralizing governance" (it actually replaces current governance with new governance). It's also non-neutral to equate XT to btcd / libbitcoin (since btcd and libbitcoin do not seek to hard fork and replace current Bitcoin, they are merely alternative implementations of Core), by trying to argue that XT makes Bitcoin "more robust by adding another software implementation".


Why? Just because Bitcoin has this nature, it doesn't mean it can't be discussed in a highly rational, precise, 'neutral', unemotional way. In fact, I think everyone needs to try to approach Bitcoin in this manner. Passion is nice, but it needs to be coupled with highly rational thought.


Yes, I think I'm coming around to thinking that: censorship = bad, while sensible 'light-touch' moderation = good.
@_date: 2015-11-01 16:45:22


This is simplification. The issue is not new features, but features that can affect Bitcoin's security argument (security, in terms of more centralization). Increasing block size increases centralization pressures, so it's important to do carefully with proper research.


This aspect of the argument is pure FUD. I'm not going to say any more on that.


We have already got one piece of the puzzle (CLTV). In fact, apparently this alone is enough for a rudimentary form of LN (more risk, which limits use cases... but those limited use cases will still work and be viable).
Next, we need CSV, which is also imminent (early 2016).
And later, malleability fixes (long-term, not required for LN to handle IoT style microtransactions).

* And yet again! You spread this propaganda that I already refuted in my last post about the concept of "Blockstream Core". Seriously? I refuted it, yet you explicitly repeat it.

Okay, but what applications and interactions do you imagine? What common ground? What constructive insights?
If Ethereum was designed so that there was no altcoin, only gas for contracts, then perhaps it would be possible to find synergies with Bitcoin by saying that 'bitcoin' could be the currency, while 'gas' could be used to help the contracts work. That would be an example of finding applications and interactions. The way Ethereum is designed, I don't see that possibility being realistic.

Higher volume (inevitable once wallets begin integrating with JM) would mean higher profits for liquidity providers, I'm guessing. So, it's only a matter of time. Also, this is supported if you consider that users will want to CoinJoin with multiple people (to increase privacy), while each new user 1) will not necessarily choose to provide liquidity, and 2) each user that chooses to provide liquidity will only represent one additional liquidity provider.
tl;dr -- Demand for CoinJoining would seem to increase faster than supply, which means higher profit as adoption rises.

Don't get me wrong. I agree with much of what you just said in this post.
I agree that Monero's community is quite nice in a way (technical minded people are among them, and overall the community is unified behind the privacy goal, which is a good thing), and that the tech has potential in privacy (but has severe fundamental downsides!! in other ways).
I disagree that the liquidity is "strong" -- how do you say that? On average, it's 1,000x less than Bitcoin's liquidity. It's also on the lower side, relative to many of the other alts in top 15 mkt cap, and dominated by 1 exchange with 85-90% of liquidity.
Still, while some of these things may very well be true... it does not change the fact that Bitcoin is not some "static" technology. It can change, in many, many, many ways. Let's say the core protocol is prevented from changing, due to whatever reasons (let's say VC money wants a transparent protocol, since it's so established and they think gov. will crack down otherwise).
So what? That's exactly why sidechains are being developed by a rock star team of cryptographers and programmers with $21 million of VC money, so as to provide freedom for the protocol for those who want different things but who cannot necessarily change the main protocol. That's also why layer 2 solutions (via wallets, via smart contracts like with JoinMarket, etc.) exist.
In other words, the fundamental flaw is that Monero has no "lock" on being the only cryptocurrency with the ability to implement privacy tech. Bitcoin, being 1,000x bigger (with corresponding higher resources at its community's disposal), can pick and choose what it wants, in whatever form it wants, and evolve too. All it fundamentally takes is a strong market-driven need. If the users are insistent on privacy tech, then someone somewhere somehow will make it happen. And as you can see, it's already happening if you examine the situation, as the community is horrified at blacklisting possibilities and gets in an uproar anytime there is even a hint of it possibly happening (which has led to various efforts underway to deal with this possible future issue).
So yeah, I think the long-run outcome is inevitable.
Disagree? Let me know why.
p.s. Don't forget, I'm not biased. I can very easily invest into it if I wanted to, but I just don't see a future in it, and further, there is too high of a risk that it will be rendered obsolete for me to tolerate.

Yes, 100 million satoshis. Thanks for the correction.
In terms of single satoshis, Lightning is being designed to allow that. In fact, it seems highly appropriate for Lightning to be used to make possible the "Fidelity Effect", assuming Fidelity wants to move satoshis (colored coins?).

*My questions:*
1. When will the new firmware with secure initialization be released?
2. What are the plans, if any, for mass production of low-cost commoditized hardware wallets (sub-$5 or sub-$1)? Any ideas to partner with exchanges or payment processors or other businesses, in order to allow such hypothetical super-low-cost hardware wallets to be provided to customers free of charge, to widely boost bitcoin security and thus lay the path for a realistic mass adoption scenario (as a result of 'solving' security)?
3. Can you comment on if it's possible to partner with breadwallet (2nd most popular wallet on iOS) to enhance its security, by removing reliance on assurance of security of: 1) iOS, and 2) breadwallet developers? Any similar partnerships, or plans, with other iOS or Android wallets?


You must be the first "bitcoin.com AMA person" to be humble enough and practical enough, to say this &amp; acknowledge the problem &amp; do this! That alone just boosted your reputation, in my books, significantly. Thank you.
For the record, the other problems many have is: 1) don't trust bitcoin.com to save personal info like email &amp; IP to an account there, and 2) prefer Reddit style threading as opposed to late-90s-style messaging board, and 3) bitcoin.com is advertising itself based on exaggerated claims regarding censorship and so doing a political stunt to advertise a for-profit website (bitcoin.com) -- i.e. unethical.

I understand, but I think the best way to counter something you genuinely disagree with is to argue against it with logic and facts. If you have the truth behind you, then your argument will prevail. If not, then your argument will crumble (as it should).
@_date: 2015-11-28 20:18:56
Sure, and everyone agrees with you that mining is highly centralized! :). I was responding only to the headline. You should see Maxwell talk about mining &amp; centralization. He is positively horrified by what is happening, as am I. Things are "fine" right now practically speaking, but I am concerned that it will not last and is not sustainable. Centralization = Inevitable regulation pressures and/or influence by special interest groups.
The downside to decentralized mining is changes may not be implemented as quickly anymore. Then again, maybe that can be fixed by implementing an idea that restricts level of decentralization to the hundreds or thousands. Nodes do a good job of upgrading, and they are in the 5000 range. Or, there may be another way to handle it?
One idea that seems to have value in this context is 21's distributed mining, as 21 is backed by large amounts of capital ($100+ million, plus the founder's VC firm manages billions of USD) to implement its vision. If they can collaborate with the community and develop a viable scheme, then there may be hope.
Or, maybe there will be a breakthrough on the academic research side for a form of PoW that is truly resistant to centralization.
Or, maybe ASICs hit a ceiling in efficiency and become more commoditized?

We do need to compromise, or we risk a schism hard fork from the other side. It's also beyond time to put this horribly divisive issue behind us. Why are you so confident in your view there will be no fork? Many Core devs at this point are in agreement on this point I'm making. It's better for everyone to come together with a passable compromise (and let things like Lightning properly solve the issue in the next 1-2 years), than it is to let this issue fester and have chaos in the community.

You need to clarify exactly what you mean by this statement.
@_date: 2015-11-30 16:29:28


Correct, and the CEO (Balaji) is extremely knowledgeable and intelligent, and well-informed about the scalablity debates, and closely working with Bitcoin Core developers to develop for his 21BC. He is not a corporate stooge (also not merely a CEO, as you noted he is also among the heads of Horowitz), and will not simply bend over for Brian Armstrong's wishes.


Demonstrably false (there is more than 1 way to skin a cat -- they have supported concept of 'payment channels' &amp; Lightning -- as well as, in the interim, an off-chain solution):
* 


How about a scientific framework backed by most of Bitcoin's developers, and mining hashrate? That sounds quite tangible and solid promises-based to me.
And, the above is also why I can't imagine Coinbase's CEO is actually serious, and why he must be bluffing. The funding VCs aren't stupid. They will realize the facts of the matter of where the ecosystem is aligned (90% anti-XT and pro-Core), and they will act accordingly. They are not going to destroy Bitcoin's network effect by alienating most of its developers &amp; miners. That is the opposite of smart, and it's the surest way *not* to see a high probability of success and payback. The highest chance of success is to achieve consensus among the majority of devs + miners. That requires something sensible (i.e. not as defined by Brian Armstrong's arrogant &amp; bullying behavior, in terms of setting a date deadline for a hard fork).

I didn't even mention "sidechains" :). You know even merchants regularly deny use of credit/debit cards for low-cost items, due to the fees payment processors charge merchants for customers paying with those cards? This is not a problem exclusive to Bitcoin.
Anyway, use ChangeTip or wait for Bitcoin to be able to accommodate low-cost payments in a trust-minimized manner. The solution cannot rationally be to screw up the system so people can make low-cost payments with Bitcoin when the system is not ready.
And again, the fee which I showed you is only 5 cents right now with Bitcoin, so that's hardly prohibitive even for low-cost payments (in the range of a "few dollars").

The initial part of my response was directed towards HBW.
I wasn't going to respond, but you asked a seemingly innocent question (and a legitimate question), so I felt compelled to give you the benefit of the doubt with a quick response, in the hopes that you're a person of reason.


Peter did not merely point out possibilities, as I already explained. I can add another direct quote though: "Blockstream's implementation of the protocol (Core)" &lt;-- clear misrepresentation of reality and explicit claim of reality, not mere suggestion.


So, I stated 3 points. The first point can be said to be "not known for certain" (I can't read theymos' mind), but the other two points are pretty clearly fact-based. So why are you generalizing, and making accusations based on generalizations? Even the theymos point I can say I have high degree of certainty about, based on the vast amount of info I've read and analyzed and thought about on this topic -- but sure, there is no guarantee about that.


Sigh. Maybe I was wrong, and should not have bothered replying. Lots and lots of unsubstantiated accusations in your post, casually thrown around. It seems you had already made up your mind, so I don't know why you made the original request to me to clarify myself.

This is not a real issue, to be honest. How is a high-traffic day (Black Friday) *not* expected to produce high traffic? Not to mention, the traffic is not even that high. Look here, and you'll see ~3,300 txs in mempool right now, and avg tx fee = 7 satoshis/byte. What's unusual about that? It's pretty typical.


So that's one thing. The other thing is: suppose we had 8 MB blocks. Well, if we had 8x more tx demand we would be filling up the mempool to a similar extent. In other words, increasing block size does not actually solve the problem. It just moves the goal posts, and if those goal posts are reached, then *boom*. Same problem as with current 1 MB block.
The only proposed technological fix that actually increases scale by a significant amount (100x or higher) is a solution involving payment channels, such as Lightning network.

No "problem" per se; I just disagree that "token-free blockchain tech" (like Eris, et. al) is the way forward.

Bitcoin owes it to itself to follow Satoshi Nakamoto's vision, and the ideals of the cypherpunk movement from which it originates. Democracies are easily corrupted and compromised by special interests, so it is a good thing that Bitcoin does not purely follow such a model.
Did you consider that CryptoVoter got no support because of the inflammatory ideas on its main page, which are mostly in opposition to the freedom inherent in Bitcoin? It betrays the founder's real motives.
* **Remove pseudo-anonymity** &lt;-- I think there's a typo. It should read: "Increase privacy and anonymity of users, so as to better resist coercion or threat of coercion"
* **Blacklist stolen bitcoins** &lt;-- Another typo? It should read: "Increase fungibility of bitcoins, so as to better mimic cash"
* **Regulation compliant codebase** &lt;-- Another typo! It should read: "Politics-resistant codebase, so as to maximize freedoms of users"
* **Increase maximum block size** &lt;-- The only legitimate idea, and one most of the ecosystem already supports, so it's redundant...
So yeah, if the founder of CryptoVoter wants to create "Govcoin", then he can feel free to do that? Bitcoin kindly passes.


I am curious, though. How do you imagine this would "benefit our community"? As I mentioned, democracies are easily corrupted. Development focused on technical merit, rather than influenced by an increase of politics in Bitcoin, would appear to be the way to go. And, the open-source nature of current Bitcoin development (over IRC, GitHub, mailing list) is aligned with that.
In what way would shifting technical decisions to people lacking technical knowledge be beneficial? Should development of nuclear reactors be subject to vote by shareholders, or should the engineers make the decisions? Should NASA outsource its space shuttle development to the people of the US to vote on how to design shuttles, or should its engineers be making development decisions?

I estimate they are either bluffing (They will not actually risk a giant schism (it's bad for their business)), or have an idea in mind to get the hashrate required for the fork in line with their plan.
To counter, I think as quickly as possible Core devs &amp; miners &amp; whoever else (maybe large investors, VC firms like Andreessen Horowitz, companies like 21, Balaji, etc.) needs to jointly write a letter (maybe closed letter is better, or open?) and sign it, and submit to the Coinbase CEO, making clear that they will not be bullied into moving to a fork. Also, make it clear a scientific framework for scalability is in place (SB and  and that they are welcome to attend and follow the progress.
To be perfectly rational, it is impossible for them to move on if they lose 90% of developers and 90% of miners. It will be a massive PR scandal. Any significant investors in BTC will not tolerate it.

I don't understand. LN benefits don't seem to have much to do with this? LN has instant confirmation (secure instant; not 1/10 security of confirmation resulting from blocks every 1 min instead of 10 min). LN also allows micropayments of 1 satoshi. Regular minimum payment is limited to much higher than that. LN also allows vastly higher scalability than is possible merely with block size increase alone (or with reducing confirmation time to 1 min).

It's not about popularity, it's about consensus and compromise. I mean, I don't think this community can handle much more bickering.

After that, we can figure out how the tech landscape looks, and how well Lightning works in practice, and revisit scalability.

There is fraud risk due to irreversibility, but that fraud risk does *not* exist if bitcoins are properly secured to prevent unauthorized transactions. Further, properly securing bitcoins in that manner is not an impossible task nor even a difficult task.

1. In terms of the dollar, even Coinbase's CEO has said he thinks it could be replaced within 15 years. So what? Even outside research (by the UN or World Bank, I think?) has discussed such possibilities. This isn't some political issue; it's just a fact of the possibilities if Bitcoin were to get traction, since Bitcoin would out-compete fiat.
2. In terms of "mass adoption", if Jerry Brito is going to be all talk and Blockchain Alliance is all about rhetoric (and not actually influencing protocol development, or hindering transactions via BitFury's mining), then fine. That needs to be made abundantly clear though, and it needs to be legally binding if possible.
3. As a general point, what do you think about Apple? Apple refuses to work with regulators on unlocking its phones, as a matter of defending privacy. Is there something wrong if the Bitcoin industry makes certain points clear that can't be violated? Privacy is not a "libertarian issue"; it's a human rights issue, as Tim Cook has stated.

This. I'm very surprised / shocked at the lack of urgency being granted to actually doing something about this problem. The solution cannot be "it's not an issue, it's just a nuisance, you should tell wallet developers to do something". The solution would be to fix the protocol so this deception cannot be orchestrated. Whether or not it's actually serious is beside the point; the perception is what matters most, and this "attack" hurts Bitcoin's credibility.
I mean, it should be clear that whoever is doing this, is intending it as an attack on Bitcoin. It should also be implied that the attacker knows they cannot actually make money from it. So, the motive is to simply disrupt Bitcoin and cause chaos, perhaps also damaging its reputation with users who do not know what is going on.
Are we really going to allow this to happen? Bitcoin is a $3.5 billion currency and payment system. It really needs to be treated like it, with acute problems fixed on an aggressive timescale.

Some say "joke," some say "trolling." I get your point though.
I don't think it's relevant because it would be misleading to use MAUs, since some could buy in one go in terms of whatever they want to invest, while others would prefer to buy in a staggered formation. Since you can't distinguish the two, using MAUs isn't appropriate. Someone willing to take the time to sign up and verify identity &amp; banking details can be considered a 'user', surely. Going back to your social media comparison, there is hardly any friction involved in setting up an account, and the company does not profit by users logging on once and never returning. That's clearly in contrast to a service like Coinbase, for reasons I mentioned earlier.
To put it this even more concretely, so this discussion doesn't drag on forever... User "X" opened a Coinbase account 2 years ago and purchased $10,000 of bitcoins at $300 (and paying Coinbase a 1% fee). This represented 5% of his savings, and User "X" was content with taking this position. In the years since, User "X" has not been interested in purchasing more. Does this mean User "X" is not really a Coinbase user? Compare that to User "Y" who has purchased $100 a month for the last 2 years (and paid 1% fee).

Good point, and I should have been more careful to take that assumption into account in the first place, but...
Practically speaking, breadwallet operates on the principle of setting its fee to achieve medium-priority confirm speed and lowest fee possible.
When I've used it, this means typically fee of 42 bits with a 225 byte tx. That means 4200/225 = 18.7 satoshis/byte, vs. spam fee rate of ~1 satoshi/byte.
Maybe not 30x difference, but it's still a 18.7x difference. Thus, my point still stands?


I'm not sure what you're saying here exactly. Can you clarify?
Even without clarifying, I suspect my previous example makes the point invalid. If 18.7 satoshis/byte is breadwallet's fee rate, and this represents the lowest fee rate for a decent confirm speed, then this represents a 'true' rate. Removing below average txs then is a theoretical concern, while breadwallet's fee rate shows a practical rate.


I understand what you're saying... but Bitcoin is inherently an inefficient system on purpose. I agree it can't lean too much in the way of inefficiency that it hurts customer satisfaction, but... it's never going to be competitive with 'competitors' like Visa. That's just impossible, unless we want the same regulatory control of Visa and to lose the free nature of Bitcoin ... by creating a few big targets (i.e. centralized nodes) for regulators or attackers. And yes, miners are a huge issue in that regard, but no one seems to understand how to address the problem, except maybe 21 if it can redistribute hashing power among millions of entities.
Still, I think your argument doesn't apply here. Paying the standard fee that was paid forever (breadwallet's 18.7 satoshis/byte rate) leads to quick confirmation... before the spam attack, and after the spam attack. Nothing has changed. Also, keep in mind that most wallets now automatically calculate the fee necessary. Users aren't given an option to make up their own (crazy high or crazy low) fee. As wallets continue this migration to auto-fee based on network, the problem is solved right? User satisfaction is maintained, with no effect from spam attackers like Coinwallet (which is apparently responsible for this attack too).
If the spammer was malicious and well-funded, and tried to orchestrate a &gt; 18.7 satoshi/byte attack, maybe that's a different story then. What is the solution in such a scenario? I don't know. That would force users to pay higher fees, and then dissatisfaction would increase. If XT's 'remove random txs' approach was used, legit txs would be as equally removed as spam txs, which wouldn't maintain customer satisfaction either.
-- Do you have an idea to resolve such a situation? I don't think bigger blocks is an argument, since such an entity would just spend more to overcome the bigger blocks. (if they can afford 25,000 USD to attack a random network like Bitcoin, they can likely afford 200,000 USD).

I think the problem is not whether they think Bitcoin is "bad" or not. The point is they are being duplicitous. On the one hand, they say Bitcoin is useless as a value transfer mechanism, and useless as money, and that it won't last more than 5 years. On the other hand, they tweet suddenly that they "have been, are and will be bullish on  -- which is clearly false, right, given their past statements?
Basically, they need to pick a position and stick to it. No one cares if they ultimately perform the same service, since they are being unethical / cowardly / backward / ignorant about it (and since their competitors are well-funded by major financial institutions and VCs, and yet still have the courage to speak clearly about what Bitcoin really is, and demonstrate they actually understand it).
In such a situation, customers will choose their competitors, rather than tolerate Uphold's dishonesty.

The reason is because the USD is a world reserve currency, and very stable and secure, so the US does not really feel threatened. Ditto for Europe with the EUR.

Breadwallet and Airbitz are still superior, with both either fully decentralized or actively working towards it (Airbitz uses the open-source libbitcoin framework, and will join breadwallet in adopting SPV sometime this year).
And FYI regarding SPV, the other top bitcoin wallets are full clients (best option) or are SPV (i.e. Electrum) which is second-best. But, mobile encrypted locked-down devices like iOS are more secure than other computing devices, so SPV on such a device is still better.

Merchants can't switch if the miners refuse to. They have to switch in unison, otherwise they are both disrupted. In addition, developers are much harder to convince to "switch" sides (they operate on ideals, less on reasons of profit), so that is a force with Core that serves as encouragement for miners to stick with Core.
Also, this is not about belittling. I'm clear my opinion is that Core is superior software with far more support than XT. This is an opinion. It's not about belittling something. You and I love bitcoin, but I think Core is the way best way for Bitcoin to retain its dominance and continue to succeed.

Breadwallet is a great iOS option, primarily because it is SPV (so no servers will ever go down or get hacked, since the wallet connects directly to other full nodes). Breadwallet also auto-calculates fees based on network conditions, so it's very reliable. For Android, I'd recommend switching your recommendation to 'Bitcoin Wallet', since it's also SPV.
Mycelium and Airbitz are not SPV. During the spam attacks earlier, Mycelium repeatedly went down.

If you listened to him speak, you can tell he is very emotional, i.e. he feels personally affected. This means he can be motivated to use his power (via money, connections, influence, etc.) to do something to see his views become reality. Even if he does not achieve all he wants, he can do enough to stall Bitcoin and set it back.
With that in mind, to counter this, Bitcoin needs to grow as fast as possible to create as much chaos as possible in the event of a hypothetical ban (i.e. it needs to be costly for government to attempt it). In other words, it needs to follow the Uber model. It seems hyper-growth would be the best way forward, perhaps by coordinated integration on a mass scale by sympathetic parties (like tech companies).

I can't believe how offensive and misguided and false your statements are. It's really as if you're living in some alternative reality.
As I've said thousands of times:
**Produce evidence for your endless claims** (speaking to you, to jratcliffe, and all the other nonsensical people periodically circle-jerking in the XT sub with baseless accusations), **or else your claims are not true**.
What makes you think you can say what you say, when you have no evidence? **Adam** has been censoring comments?? What? Where is your evidence for such an absurd claim? Is Adam a mod on r/bitcoin? Is Adam paying mods to censor? Evidence? Evidence? Or do you not believe in evidence, just in whatever your hyperactive limbic system tells you?
You can tell u/adam3us endlessly that he is "attacking, censoring, undermining, pushing horror, lying"... but that does not make it true. I personally highly respect Adam. If you don't, the only possibility is you're hopelessly misinformed as to Adam's actual contributions and knowledge, or willing to foolishly disregard technical contributions in favor of lobbing personal attacks over baseless grievances.
In case you need a recap:


The facts, based on current stats:
* 91% of nodes are Core
* 99.9% of miners are anti-XT
* 90% of Bitcoin developers are anti-XT -- most simply do not trust Hearn to singlehandedly lead Bitcoin as a 'benevolent dictator', nor is it in any way smart to centralize development around a single individual with yes/no power on what goes into Bitcoin.
So, tell me again, what facts do you have? What "majority"? When I look at the array of Bitcoin experts, I see a massive majority in favor of Core. To be honest, they are the ones who matter, not the opinions of gangs on Reddit who don't believe in evidence and prefer to launch unprofessional and personal attacks.
It seems a lot of you in XT are on a cause "jousting at windmills" like Don Quixote, simply for the heck of it -- perhaps due to tacit encouragement and irresponsible statements made by Hearn (e.g. deriding Lightning in public because *he* feels overwhelmed by its new design, and can't wrap his head around it), perhaps due to an emotional reaction to u/theymos' admittedly misguided XT censorship (which to be fair people are still in denial about, in terms of negative impact), perhaps even because of anti-intellectualism and/or inability to comprehend new complex information (i.e. Sidechains paper, Lightning paper, etc.).
I mention the last point, because too many people don't care to actually understand new developments, and then make all kinds of incorrect conclusions later on. That's proven by how the technical posts to r/Bitcoin have rarely been commented on much. Instead, Reddit prefers to comment on emotional posts of one type or another and 'antifragility' and Andreas' talks. The technical posts and technical interviews? Hardly anyone cares. -- This includes peoplma who failed to understand Lightning until **finally** recently (when someone spoonfed to him how it works), jratcliffe who has a history of failing to try to understand new technical developments - instead preferring to go on emotional rants on how Bitcoin "seems to be getting taken over by nefarious forces", and others (but I think I've made my point). This even includes some mods in r/bitcoin!
Ignorance is a very large problem, and when there is widespread ignorance, it's hard to take democracy seriously. And btw, I'm not saying I personally am perfect in this regard. The difference is I try to speak only when I know something, and if I don't, I'm not going to keep arguing about it.

Why laptop?
What phone do you have? Jailbroken or not jailbroken?
I ask about laptop because a phone is generally far safer than a laptop. It's also important to note the difference between storing funds on a laptop or phone vs. just accessing funds from laptop or phone.
Blockchain.info is a service that stores your money on its service and lets you *access* them only.
Something like breadwallet (iOS) or Bitcoin Wallet (Android) actually store your funds on your phone, so you can control them.
On the other hand, if you're not "tech savvy", then you'd be better off trusting well-funded professional companies like Circle or Coinbase to secure your funds.

Certainly plausible. If so, it's an annoying chicken-and-egg problem. To break it, we'd maybe need a single well-capitalized entity entering the market with long-term focus, and buying heavily at 'low prices', such that price rises significantly, say from 285 to 350. At that point, the 'FOMO' may be enough to propel other entities to invest and stop waiting for a 'perfect' low price. And so on, and so forth. This theory is basically that "the spark just needs to be lit" -- but there could be more to the story than that.

In contrast, what about 2-4-8? That seems identical in the early stages: 2 MB in 2016, 4 MB in 2018, 8 MB in 2020. Then, stop and reevaluate. The benefit is we get to see where we are in 4-5 years (Bitcoin's history thus far is only 6-7 years; a lot can change in 4-5 years), and later make a new proposal as appropriate.
The major issue people have with BIP 101 is not necessarily the jump to 8 MB, but moreso that it tries to estimate too far out (20 years), an issue because it's unrealistic or not a good idea to predict that far out when it comes to technology, especially bandwidth (Vitalik recently agreed with that; he said his approach is to try to find a way to have a dynamic cap based on economic info gleaned from the blockchain).
The issue is also that BIP 101 assumes 41% rate of growth in bandwidth for 20 years, which seems unrealistic based on what we know today. Cisco predicted "end user broadband bandwidth" would increase average of 17%/year between 2015-2020.

Imagine what Brian thinks? If he sees people, such as yourself, with such strong opinions, then he will slowly start to feel it is correct! Please take responsibility for what you say.

Are you aware of the 'other side''s argument? Have you spoken with Adam Back and Greg Maxwell about their concerns, or with Bram Cohen (creator of BitTorrent), or with Nick Szabo? There is a vast array of experts out there that are strongly against a "drastic" solution that focuses on transaction capacity above all else.
Have you read about Lightning Network, and talked to its designers/developers like Rusty Russel and Joseph Poon? Lightning has the potential to scale vastly more than BIP101, and do so without compromising Bitcoin's decentralization.
To respond to your other comment in this thread:


In fact, it is not just about "innovation". It in fact is critical. Please... talk to the people I mentioned, and understand this issue deeply. Think about it this way. If Bitcoin was not decentralized "enough" (in terms of number and distribution of nodes, and in terms of mining hashrate), then it is vulnerable to regulation by government. This means transactions are no longer open, free, censorship-resistant, and without capital controls. This means Bitcoin transactions, in other words, lose what makes them unique. Are you happy to convert Bitcoin to Visa, if it means we lose these things I just mentioned? That is what is at stake.

False, Gavin has numerous incidents of inflaming tensions and insulting Core:
* He said Core devs should be fired if they won't follow his 2MB hard-fork plan (
* He mocked Adam Back's 2-4-8 scaling proposal by saying that the average webpage is more than 2MB (
* He described Core devs scaling proposal as: "This is yet another 'let's do a handstand and hop down the stairs because we're worried we might trip if we walk down' proposal", to mock their scaling proposal which has consensus among most technical contributors. (
* He has repeatedly insulted specific devs over the years (luke-jr, peter todd, mark freidenbach, greg maxwell, etc.) for "whining" about security concerns with his ideas instead of "finding solutions" -- He most recently insulted Peter Todd on Reddit, and chalked it up later to a "grumpy Monday".
* And so on, and so forth...


Wladimir has specifically stated he is not a dictator -- he only merges pull requests that have a 'rough consensus' in the technical community; and, if a pull request does not have that rough consensus, then he will refuse to merge it.
In fact, this topic of 'dictators' brings up an interesting point. XT (the Bitcoin fork that Gavin co-led and left Core for) was designed around the premise of Mike Hearn as a 'benevolent dictator'.  Hence, Gavin supported a dictator with XT. Notice your hypocrisy in criticizing Wladimir for being a dictator, when Gavin's previous hostile XT fork was designed with a benevolent dictator in its model?? So you're implicitly fine with a dictator when it suits you, but actively unhappy with a dictator when it does not suit you -- is that correct?


Actually, 'Bitcoin' was renamed to 'Bitcoin Core' way back when with Hearn/Gavin and the rest of the Core devs in support.


Indeed, and it is. Anyone is free to contribute to Bitcoin Core. We had 90+ contributors from around the world from all kinds of organizations contributing to the 0.12 release.


False. First, Bitcoin Core is a node primarily. The 'wallet' aspect is irrelevant to the protocol. Even then, Bitcoin needs a single consensus ruleset for the node. Different consensus rulesets (i.e. XT, Classic), which each change the rules, is an idea that is incompatible with how Bitcoin works. You can have the same consensus ruleset in multiple implementations, though, and we already have that -- libbitcoin, btcd, etc.
So, essentially, all of your points are false or misleading  in one way or another. I look forward to your rebuttals though, if you have any.

Maybe you misunderstood? When that user says "onion-like, tor-like way", he means Bitcoin lightning transactions passing through hubs/nodes will be encrypted. There are 20 hops with every transaction, so 20 hubs/nodes involved each time. The encryption means it is impossible for a hub/node to know where the transaction is coming from, going to, or the details of the transaction. If the hub/node knows nothing, then it's not possible for hubs/nodes to conduct AML/KYC, nor for future regulation to have any effect -- so, no need for any "wishing and hoping".
BTW, anyone can be a hub/node. The cost to do so is minimal. That's why 'hubs' is an imprecise word; they're more like 'nodes' (lightweight).

The issue is that it can't, though. The main chain cannot truly be competitive in terms of really low fees, without simultaneously reducing the decentralization of the network.
In other words, you can make the foundation (Bitcoin on-chain transactions) weaker by increasing size without care, but then you'll inevitably increase requirements for nodes (which means less nodes will run) and possibly increase orphan rates for miners (or force miners to use relay networks, which are a security threat as they are centralized -- Nick Szabo has been really adamant that the miner relay network is a huge potential security issue).
LN allows for block size to be increased in size *less*, so that we can be more conservative and maintain a strong decentralized foundation.
Yes, the fees on-chain will rise a bit (which will help with miner compensation), but it won't matter because LN will be always on and available and have fees that are as low as *less than 1 satoshi* apparently.
So, users are not going to leave Bitcoin ("drive users away") -- they will use LN instead. See this summary document for more info:

Hard to take this seriously, when your posting history suggests you're invested in ether, and hence have an ulterior motive and conflict of interest.
Can you explain what you hope to accomplish with your new sub? I'm having trouble understanding.
Ether is a currency, as is bitcoin. The two are competitors, and inherently cannot "work together", it would seem. Further, when sidechains emerge, an Ethereum sidechain will obsolete Ethereum (if in fact it's found to have value and worth making into a sidechain).

Please don't make me laugh. Is this some sort of joke? "Maturity" &amp; Mike are opposites, and this is evident if one has been paying attention to the events of the last few months and especially recently.
A sampling of examples of outright lying or deception (i.e. fudging facts to suit him), or immaturity:
*  (Elizabeth Stark notes his false statement slurring Blockstream [which is a pattern for Mike, and likely directly contributes to his followers constantly forming conspiracy theories about 'Blockstream this' and 'Blockstream that'], and claim of 20 hr travel times)
*  (User notes his false claim to invent or coin 'SPV', and cites Satoshi doing so 1 year prior)
* Going to media with statements like: "Lightning and Sidechains are not realistic solutions to scaling from an engineering perspective." -- No one has ever said sidechains were a scaling solution. Further, sidechains are way more experimental and uncertain than Lightning. So, to bring up 'sidechains' in the same sentence as Lightning and conflate the two is 1) dishonest, and 2) deceptive / careless. When combined with the fact Lightning has been peer reviewed by a great deal of Bitcoin experts, it becomes all the more appalling to make a statement like that.
*  -- disregard for Chinese miners that make up 50% of Bitcoin's mining hashrate; suggesting they can leave Bitcoin if they don't want to accept his idea &gt;&gt; ("If that's really the case, it seems to me that Chinese Bitcoin is unsustainable and **what you really need is a China-specific alt coin** that can run entirely within the Chinese internet.")
*  -- disregard for Bitcoin's overall health and cohesion and harmony; threatening to use the nuclear option to force his way against the will of Chinese miners (basically starting a 'war') if they don't agree with him &gt;&gt; ("This can happen *even* if Chinese miners who can't/won't scale up are &gt;50% hashrate. SPV clients would need **a forced checkpoint, which would be messy and undesirable, but it's technically feasible**. The smaller side of the chain would cease to exist from the perspective of people actually trading coins.")
You know, speaking honestly, the more I examine his behavior carefully, the more I realize how the word 'toxic' really may not be an exaggeration when used to describe him. He wants to be Bitcoin's benevolent dictator, regardless of the rest of the developer and mining and academic community's opposition; this much at least is incontrovertible.

Talking about theymos personally, citing his name, is considered doxing, I think. Be careful?
I don't understand why you pinged me, and quoted what I said. Are you supporting my statement, or are you saying I am wrong? I'm a bit lost.
Also, I did not say "Roger Ver is promoting inferior coded wallets". I said he has the potential to be doing this, due to the way wallets are displayed to the user based on who paid the most. I said it's a bad model, in general, especially when Roger has a fiduciary duty to the site's visitors to help them pick the absolute highest quality wallets to store their money.
As for theymos' "new forum software", I have no idea what happened in that situation. The little I've read though suggests the situation is far more complex than his detractors claimed, and that there actually was a rational justification for the way events played out. Then again, I've spent very little effort researching that issue, so maybe I'm wrong.

Can't really optimize for both use cases: To be gold, it needs to be highly decentralized and censorship-resistant. To be an effective payment rail, it needs to have a high transaction capacity -- but to have a high transaction capacity, block size would need to be increased by 1,000x immediately, which would of course massively increase centralization (of nodes and mining). That doesn't mean you can't pursue both goals simultaneously, but one goal needs to be prioritized above the other. Since gold is the bigger market, the greater value lies in prioritizing gold.

I don't know; I haven't bothered to investigate.
But, data does show that increasing block size too much too quickly will lead to reduction in node count. I'm not sure whether that's as bad as it sounds, or if the mining hashrate centralization is a much worse situation that will remain much worse even if node count decreases. Of course, the counter-argument is that why make the better thing (node count) worse just because it's not 'that bad' yet.


If I'm understanding you correctly, yes. We want decentralization of all aspects: node counts &amp; mining hashrate distribution. If we approach the problem by "how do we increase decentralization" (which basically is a euphemism for "how do we prevent Bitcoin from being strangled by governments or corporations, at will?"), then we will solve the problem directly.
My ideas...
For nodes, introduce a financial incentive to pay runners of nodes for their service, i.e. a 'node fee' akin to a 'miner fee'. If Lightning results in LN nodes being paid for relaying transactions, then maybe combining LN nodes and Bitcoin nodes into one software will achieve that.
For mining, ... actually, I have no idea. But we need to start from the premise of wanting to expand from 6 entities controlling 75% of hashrate to hundreds or thousands (or more!) of entities controlling that hashrate. We need to design a system to accomplish that.
I don't honestly know why no serious research or discussion is going on about either of these issues.

Yep, check out the previous threads on this issue. I think a solution needs to be self-sustaining rather than rely on altruism. Financial incentives are good, but ideally they will derive from the market, not by donations. For example, charging SPV clients a small fee, or having LN node integrated within, so that running a LN node generates fees that also incentive running the Bitcoin node.

Hi Charlie, I think Brian's tweet meant he was implicitly supporting XT (almost like a veiled threat?) by linking to the XT website as the source of the PDF, as the same PDF had been linked from other sources. I also think that was a little inappropriate, given the nature of Scaling Bitcoin 1 (already concluded, discussed research) and Scaling Bitcoin 2 (upcoming, to discuss scaling proposals based on the research). Brian also did not provide any technical information on proposals including pros and cons, just a vague statement that he 'thinks' we have proposals that can work and that should be implemented by December. He gave no basis nor justification, and no details of proposals either. It came off as a "person speaking from ivory tower" kind of statement.

What you describe as "order of entry" and your concern over "why would anyone agree to voluntarily join" misses the point that this is how every financial instrument has ever worked: stocks, bonds, commodities, fiat currencies... and now 'cryptocurrencies'. This is how the free market works. Everyone has equal opportunity to enter and exit the market, at whichever time they choose.
The obvious alternative to a free market is that whenever anything new emerges, it should be divided equally among the global population and distributed. I think a free market distribution will result in far better outcomes.

Yeah, that's fine. I just want people to be very upfront and honest about what the choices are. People make it seem like it's a panacea to run from r/bitcoin to bitcoin.com forum or bitco.in, when really it's exchanging one moderator for another moderator.
In the case of bitcoin.com, maybe the owner has good intentions but he also has a history of overpaying someone to create a horribly designed website that allows paying money to promote wallets (instead of arranging wallets by merit).
In the case of bitco.in, who knows who bloomie is and what his motive is, or if he is able to be bought off in the future assuming the site blows up with traffic? I don't.
What I do know is that although u/theymos frankly fucked up with the decision to censor XT, he has also run two major communities for many years (and not been bought out) and, overall, they have been run very well. Most users have been satisfied (until this recent drama). People will say "blockstream bought u/theymos", but looking at the facts with a rational mind, that claim is logically bogus and unsupported by evidence.
So, overall, personally I would trust my data to be safeguarded by Reddit (rather than bitcoin.com or bitco.in -- no idea of their security protocols), and moderation to be done by u/theymos and the other mods here (rather than Ver or "bloomie").
Happy to hear your response.

What exactly are you saying? The purpose of getting AdidasCoin is to receive a source of monetary value that can serve the purpose of the customer getting a discount on Adidas products. That is what the original article itself is saying.
And a discount costs money (in bitcoins or USD or alt-coin) if it's a true discount being given. Or, it does not cost money, if the original price is raised prior to giving the 'discount'. The purpose of the "giant cash giveaway" is to act as a "discount" that incentives use of the product (advertising it to your peers), and thus encourages lock-in since the customer is getting paid for using the product (i.e. getting a 'discount' on future purchases of the company's products).
As in all marketing, the 'cash giveaway' needs an ROI, as I illustrated above. It's never simply a free cash giveaway; otherwise it's not marketing, but charity.

1) It was not a smear. It was a single factual statement of his CIA involvement, after which Satoshi left. Whether Satoshi left due to this is not known. It's simply an observation, although a clear one? He immediately left after hearing about it. Not sure where the conspiracy is in that.
2) It doesn't make sense to me that you commit a 'wrong' to because someone did it too. That's not how it works.
3) It most definitely is a smear, as an objective look at Greg's actions reveal he cares extremely deeply about Bitcoin. Like I said, he is single-handedly responsible for most of Bitcoin's privacy technologies, as well as lots of work in 'mining' research, and peer reviewing research studies by others.


Totally agree. However, your prior post did nothing to achieve that. You smeared Greg, and went on a tirade about Gavin &amp; CIA, even though OP only wrote a single observational statement about Gavin.
But yes, I agree with the rest of that post. We have some fanatics (a very tiny minority of r/bitcoin), who think absolutely no contact ever is the path to success. But, the vast majority understand communication is a good thing and essential. Satoshi himself acknowledged the power of government, and his fears over Wikileaks accepting donations. I think everyone should be extremely clear on reality, and not try to pretend we are invincible. We can still achieve end objectives, but intelligently. Even Bruce Fenton understands that, and has said so repeatedly. The criticism with Blockchain Alliance is over a different issue... which I won't repeat here.

This is not true, though, so why are you saying it like it's fact? Miners have been clear that they do not support BIP 101. They may be okay with increasing to 8 MB right now, but no more than that. BIP 101 says go to 8 MB, then increase for 20 years at rate of 41%/year. Developers have also been clear that BIP 101 is probably not a good idea. If there was a "supermajority" of support among all groups, then we would not still be debating it and having the two Scaling Bitcoin conferences.


This is unrealistic. No proposal being constructed says that. I've listed all the proposals that I know about, in the original post. There is however a proposal (BIP 103++) that possibly has consensus of key figures (Garzik &amp; Maxwell &amp; Szabo) that suggests removing the cap entirely and instead adding a UTXO constraint.


Again, your post is filled with you saying: "I love BIP 101, and so does everyone else" -- even though the "so does everyone else" part is false, as I explained earlier about miners &amp; developers. And the businesses that you say support it? Various of them have come out and said they changed their mind and don't actually care particularly about BIP 101, and are open to other ideas. And the business that is adamant about BIP 101? That's Coinbase, which has not provided any justification for its position. Hence, it's position of support of BIP 101 is not worth anything, IMO (otherwise, it becomes 'argument from authority').

LN *is* technically "off-chain", already. LN just achieves the same thing in a trustless manner (no trusted third party [TTP] like ChangeTip that can take custody of a user's funds). And, to respond to the rest of your argument, it's the same thing with ChangeTip today. I could you 1 satoshi but you're not going to be able to send that money on-chain to another address, are you?
LN opens up the micropayment niche, which [isn't feasible with Bitcoin today in a trustless manner](
So, to repeat from my previous comment, there is simply no need for that large on-chain tx fee, as it is not worth transacting the small amount from our example on-chain anyway.
I think the central points are:
* LN uses 'bitcoin' as currency &amp; Bitcoin uses 'bitcoin' as currency
* LN address = a type of Bitcoin address (2 party multisig)
* LN transaction = a type of Bitcoin transaction (a type of 'payment channel')
* LN transaction = trustless off-chain (navigating off-chain via LN nodes)
* Bitcoin transaction = trustless on-chain (navigating on-chain via Bitcoin full nodes).
* And, ChangeTip = trusted off-chain (navigating via ChangeTip's servers).

Yes, and it's to the OP's credit that he wrote a very neutral headline, along with a neutral post. It's about seeking facts, and not pushing agendas.
I don't know who you are, but if you make an effort to be neutral instead of insinuating things that lack evidence, then I'm sure you'd have a better experience. What the mods don't like is 'trolling', and they see that as 'unsubstantiated accusations'. If someone makes a post saying "Blockstream is funded by big banks because 'big bank x' contributed 50% of their funding", then everything will be hunky-dory.

There's too much involved, and I'd rather not repeat myself. Can you look through these comments:


I've tried to explicate myself, there.
Basically, I don't think this is a simple matter of choosing a BIP 101, and then life goes on as normal.
I think it: 1) is not necessarily the best decision from a technical POV, and 2) it can cause massive disruption to Bitcoin's future health, since it has a good chance of: a) alienating 90% of Bitcoin's developers by ignoring their concerns, b) alienating miners since in the 1 year that XT has existed, literally 0% of hashrate has endorsed or adopted XT (in fact, BitFury released a detailed white paper that analyzed the situation, and concluded that XT governance was far inferior to Core governance, and that BIP101 was inferior to other proposals because it would drastically reduce node count), c) chain reaction consequence could likely include the aforementioned alienated developer talent leaving Bitcoin and migrating to a competing cryptocurrency (monero, v2 bitcoin, zerocash, etc.)... so this would seriously harm Bitcoin's network effect, as well as presenting a credible competitor to Bitcoin, and thus harming the original bitcoin., d) inevitable PR scandal and negative media attention as they report on "Bitcoin's split from most of its current developers &amp; miners".
Link to BitFury's white paper on the debate:
* 
Basically, I can extrapolate a completely ugly and chaotic situation unfolding. It would seriously damage confidence in Bitcoin and harm its reputation. Price reduction would be inevitable. Long-term health would be threatened. Uncertainty would skyrocket.
Compare this, to instead taking Bitcoin's developers &amp; miners seriously, and just engaging in a fair, polite manner, and working to achieve consensus together on scaling. It's not like Devs aren't trying. There are credible proposals on the table (Lightning) and work being done to bring them to reality (Scaling Bitcoin conference  and  and BitFury has endorsed Lightning as has Balaji of 21. Lightning is a longer-term proposal. Shorter-term, there is agreement on a small-scale block size increase (among other ideas) with a time frame of 5-ish years (increase size from 1 to 2 to 4 to 8 MB, for example).
Basically, there is no reason for Brian to choose the former option, when a reasonable path is available to follow. I hope the big investors behind the scenes can understand this situation, before it's too late.
Part of the problem, I think, is that Mike Hearn poisoned the debate before he left for R3. He implied bad faith on Core devs + on Blockstream, and lots of people ate the story up. I wouldn't be surprised if Brian may have accepted that version of events, too. Hearn literally said a couple weeks ago: "Bitcoin can only survive if Core is killed".

Hello, Mr. PUMP. Nice to meet you.

:( There needs to be a way for knowledgeable people to have greater influence over Bitcoin. I'm so discouraged and sick and tired of seeing (frankly, idiots) people who know nothing, endlessly posting the same regurgitated nonsense. People do not read and learn and update their views; they just repeat themselves, even after months go by.
Please tell me that Reddit is not representative of Bitcoin's reality, and that devs, miners, companies, exchanges, processors, VCs, investors, etc. are all much better informed than what is illustrated by Reddit? If not, please get together with everyone else and construct some method, by which the truth and facts can be presented in an up-to-date, clarified, simple, easy to understand manner.
For example, in the AMA right now with Circle CEO, I just read Jeremy say it seems Bitcoin doesn't seem to be able to get things done anymore, and no updates are happening to the protocol. Is he not aware about CLTV, CSV, malleability fixes, etc. etc.? If not, why not? Is he not aware about Lightning, or the care with which block size needs to be handled, or that there are compromise proposals already being discussed (like 2-4-8, or 3-6-9, or 2-3-4-6-8, or 3-5-6-8-9), or about the Hong Kong conference that specifically will be presenting actionable proposals on scalability?
Why do I (someone with no real influence or leverage in the Bitcoin ecosystem) know all these things, but people like CEO of Circle are clueless about this larger context?
Am I wrong, or is he wrong?
What can be done to reduce the information asymmetry and ensure everyone is on the same page, and more coordinated? Part of the issue is this is decentralized by nature, which presents challenges. But, if we are all to be successful, this deficiency cannot be allowed to continue unresolved, right?
Please tell me something is being done, or that something will be done soon. And, of course, I do hope those of us here aren't being lied to, and that Hearn is not actually correct (that Core is uninterested in raising block size). I do hope Core devs are actually sincere in raising block size appropriately (based on technicals AND supply/demand considerations -- TradeBlock has done research on trends in block size and capacity), and that it will be done in a very timely manner following Hong Kong.
If you'd be more comfortable replying in PM, then feel free.

@_date: 2015-10-30 22:17:09
I said that because I imagine the idea is to position Bitcoin as a viable replacement for Visa (to take over its $200 billion USD market cap), with the capacity to handle its volume (regardless of current demand). That's the standard businesses are usually held up to.
Increasing at a certain rate (like BIP 101) would take 14 years (8 * 2^7 ) to reach [Visa-level tx capacity]( which is about 2,500 tx/sec, or 1,000x. I don't think it's credible to position Bitcoin as a Visa-killer, if it will take 14 years to get to Visa's current average tx rate. Instead, Bitcoin would have to be able to handle Visa-level demand right away.
That's the cool thing with targeting "gold market", instead. It's a way bigger market ($7 trillion USD), and it gets even better. If bitcoin took over gold, then bitcoin would have to actually have a market cap of $7 trillion. Bitcoin also makes a fantastic digital gold (it's competitive).
If, on the other hand, bitcoin took over Visa, then bitcoin does not necessarily then get a market cap of $200 billion. I haven't taken the time to figure out what the figure would be, but Visa's market cap is due to it earning profit on every transaction. Bitcoin is not in such a position, so being used purely as a payment rail may result in low enough demand for bitcoin (in a buy and hold sense) that it doesn't even capture that $200 billion USD market cap. Further, Visa offers tons of extra features that Bitcoin could never offer (instant confirmation, reversible txs for customer convenience, etc.), so it's no guarantee Bitcoin would even compete well against Visa.

I skimmed through the article, and I still don't see really what your concern is.
It says the estimated number of bitcoin users by 2019 (within the next 4 years) is 5 million, and that 5 million users are satisfied with 1MB block size if we assume between 2 to 10 to 20 settlement transactions/year... or, even 50 settlement transactions/year with a simple bump from 1MB to 2MB.


If users "may only be required to make (on average) 2 on-chain transactions to open and close payment channels per year" and you describe it as "perhaps" optimistic (indicating a reasonable chance it's a decent estimate), then what is the issue?


Sure, but that block size needs to happen according to growth in demand. The proposals take that into account. Your statement that "tx capacity needs to be raised well above the upper limits of most block size proposals" is also contradicted by the previous thing I wrote, where I cite you showing 1MB is fine for 5 million people (due to occur only by 2019).


Based on the data you've given, I don't see why data center mining and full nodes is inevitable.

 , seriously.
Also, it may take 20 sec to create a new account, but then you lose all user history. Plus, mods can be severe on new accounts (since it's legit suspicious for a new user to be posting opinionatedly about bitcoin) by default, as they already are. It may thus be effective :).
Also, when posts are removed, it serves to remove misinformation. We had an example in this thread where a user had a legit concern that Blockstream has been "known" to be controversial, since "others have said so". He actually thought so, due to hearing it! That's the effect of misinformation, and not taking a hard line on accusations without evidence.
Finally, for posts that are removed, a user must be posting the post. If the user has a history, then you can target the root (the user) directly, right? If it's a new user, then back to my first argument 2 paragraphs earlier (just be strict with new users, and let automod filter most spam out).

BTW Mike, relating to my previous message...


I want to actually dial back our tone and reduce the emotion. It's not helpful. Please can we return the discussion to assuming we both want what is best for Bitcoin, and debate it in an open way to seek truth, not to impose our pre-conceived notions on the other?
I just want to add that I actually truly do respect your focus on user satisfaction and user perception and user experience. Jeff Garzik is one of the few who also has a very practical bent, and understands importance of UI / UX.
And, I fully agree some people don't seem to understand its importance or don't care. I had my own horrible experience when participating anonymously in Bitcoin's IRC one time. I even previously posted on Reddit about it, although I didn't share my chat log of the incident.
Suffice to say, I sympathize with you. I'm not stranger to the idiocy of some people, who put user consideration at the bottom of their list. There is a reason why Apple is so much more successful in the smartphone/tablet (and laptop/desktop) industries, and why Android struggles (Apple makes 92% of profit in smartphoness!!!). And, it would be wise for Bitcoin to understand and appreciate the incredible importance of UI / UX. Luckily, some like Aaron Voisine do understand it and go to great lengths to make their software powerful but still easy to use, i.e. breadwallet.
I also checked Satoshi's words that you referred to, and you're right in what he said, but it's very contradictory. He thinks 100 GB can be transmitted by a user in 1 day in "several years", which obviously did not play out. It's been 7 years since 2008, and the percentage of users, even in developed countries, who can transmit 100 GB in 24 hours, is abysmal. And even if bandwidth is sufficient for it, there are usually ISP data caps of 200-500 GB *per month*.
So, whatever Satoshi imagined in terms of bandwidth clearly was a bad estimate. We shouldn't be citing a bad estimate as evidence that Satoshi wanted Bitcoin to be a Visa analog. Satoshi also thought CPU mining would be the way things would work, and wanted at least a "gentleman's agreement" on not using GPU mining, but clearly mining has gone to extremes and become very centralized since then.
The fact remains Satoshi envisioned Bitcoin as a "purely p2p network", and he did not trust the existing system. He had revolutionary intentions. He did not want to "work with the system". In that vein, the cypherpunks and cryptographers deserve a lot of credit, not disdain. They can be short-sighted sometimes in certain ways, but it doesn't invalidate their contribution to Bitcoin's efforts, such as fungibility -- and Satoshi certainly respected them.
See this excerpt:






Of course, there's also the message in the Genesis block to remember:


My point is, if we want to push Satoshi's vision, we better remember his origins and what he truly wanted and his motivation. A system that turns into Visa is not compatible with that.

The speaker seems to be exaggerating, just a little bit. As far as the overall market is concerned, *most* bitcoins are valued the same. There is a tiny set of bitcoins (i.e. bitcoins from coinbase rewards, from miners) that can be sold at a premium -- see  -- but all other bitcoins are equal &amp; hence 99.99% fungible, for now. This is good, because Bitcoin needs a little time for mainstream (very easy to use, integrated with wallets, etc.) fungibility-ensuring technologies to become available.
Keep your eyes glued on the following technologies:
* CoinJoin (via r/JoinMarket project)
* [Confidential Transactions]( by u/adam3us and u/nullc
* [Lightning]( (with encrypted onion routing of all transactions)
* [Sidechains]( (once mature, privacy sidechains can emerge)
Also, bitcoin wallets that respect privacy:
* [Samourai]( with a suite of privacy tweaks including Tor, and planned r/JoinMarket integration
* [breadwallet]( with upcoming '[Merge Avoidance]( and open to integrating iOS Tor and r/JoinMarket as they mature

Sure, but keep in mind the 'huge hashrate' (plus node counts, mining decentralization, etc.) is quite important for security. And, security is  privacy is  in terms of priorities. If the chain is not secure from potential attack, the privacy is worthless. This is what makes Bitcoin's network effect important.

XT is a governance coup (substitutes core devs for Hearn), so fuck that. Did you not see the ZeroHedge articles? Even Tyler Durden is anti-XT and sees the foolishness of XT, with its negative impact on confidence &amp; price. cc: u/fuckoftheclown3. Do not be misled. Bitcoin does not need to centralize and become regulated Visa, in order to be successful. Scalability will come, in due time. No one doesn't want Bitcoin to scale, but maintaining a secure decentralized network is just as important.
Recently, Coinbase CEO tweeted about wanting scalability decided by December, and since then Adam Back tweeted about working to create BIPs for Hong Kong conference, which Coinbase CEO retweeted (i.e. endorsed). So, in other words, do not worry about scalability, but at the same time, please stop supporting divisive rash efforts (like XT) that only fracture the community and threaten confidence in Bitcoin (and hence price).

You've hit the nail on the head, with your last sentence. This is precisely what I think is the end-game, and which is why I think any "alt"-coin is quite doomed. I agree with a lot of the rest of your points too. Basically though, if bitcoin receives fungibility via layer 2 [wallets (JM integration, merge avoidance, stealth addresses) and/or Lightning (txs by default encrypted via onion-routing) or sidechains (cryptonote, zerocash)], or through the protocol by default... either way, those who desire it will get it via bitcoin itself. This is why it may not actually matter whether it is included in the protocol by default. Still, like you said, existence of strong privacy tech in altcoins will be a thorn that r/bitcoin at least will keep hammering, and it should incentivize and give a mandate for encouraging bitcoin fungibility tech.
Hence, there will be no need for an alt-coin, in order to access such functionality.
Sure right now, fungibility techniques are at a primitive level, but it is getting better day by day. Those who care will use it, while the masses who don't care (sad reality) will not. And, in fact, things like Lightning will provide lots of privacy by default too, and would require no core protocol privacy changes. This is how the world works today, too -- those who care take efforts to be private, those who don't care (most people) self-violate their privacy willingly all day long.
Do you see how privacy alt-coin pretty much lack a future, or at best are limited to an incredibly niche status? At least, if not pegged to bitcoin through a sidechain. This is why I think Monero's best chance at thriving is to immediately make plans to become a sidechain (once sidechains are available). It will be unpopular among monero investors, but I see no other path forward. Monero devs like fluffy don't like the idea for the reason (to me it is a convenient excuse) that it makes Monero "rely on Bitcoin's security". If you understand network effect and security comparisons though, that's nonsensical, since Bitcoin's security is literally many orders of magnitude above Monero's.
If people have to choose between security of the main Bitcoin blockchain and the convenience of using and transacting with bitcoins vs. altcoins, you can imagine the vast majority will choose Bitcoin and disregard altcoins. Those who want more privacy will have plenty of "good enough" cryptographic privacy options (as described).

Is that why Snowden has publicly praised Apple in the last 6 months? Or, why Apple's CEO has taken the highly risky move of publicly praising Snowden? Surely you realize this is extremely politically risky, as a lot of people in the US and the White House and intelligence communities hate Snowden with a passion.
Apple complied with requests because they had to, since iOS 7 and earlier were not encrypted with the user's passcode. They intentionally made iOS 8 and onwards user-encrypted, so that it would be impossible for them to comply with requests. They were also the first company to announce it! Google's Android announced they'd do the same *after* Apple had made that decision.
In other words, Apple has taken initiative with actions to defend privacy &amp; security, as well as said all the right things to provide cover (since they are so large and wealthy) for everyone else who wants to defend those things. But, their public defense of Snowden and Snowden's reciprocation really clinch the deal. I'm actually worried these days that Apple, specifically Tim Cook, is going to become a target.

I don't know, I surely understand this point, but I disagree that the reality is as cynical as this.

For this reason, I highly doubt they are taking a cynical view on it, as is implied by your reasoning. I mean obviously it's not altruism (you don't start a business to go bankrupt), but I doubt they're "happy" because they're "getting rich off transactions".

Brian, are you serious about this?


You realize that most of Bitcoin's developers work on Core, and support Core, right? You realize that this kind of, what is essentially mutiny, risks creating a civil war in Bitcoin, and crashing the price as a result, as well as halting future development of the Bitcoin protocol? Speaking frankly, have you gone out of your mind, or have you sold out? I can't even imagine what would possess you to say these words. XT has almost zero adoption, since it was announced, while Core has retained almost all support by developers and miners. And what about Scaling Bitcoin conference  that has ended, and  that is coming up in a matter of days? Everyone in Bitcoin is hard at work trying to figure out the best solution.
**disclaimer:** I don't mean to make any assumptions or speak for anyone else with my post. I basically just want to know exactly what communication has occurred between you, Brian, and between members of Core, and what has caused you to say what you said.

I don't think OP understands the difference between various implementations of SAME consensus (Core, btcd, libbitcoin) vs. various implementations of DIFFERENT consensus (Core, XT, unlimited).

'Median' shows which size is actually being used in the middle of the pack, while 'mean' is an average of all sizes and doesn't necessarily refer to a size being used (more sensitive to extreme values). It may be nice to consider both.

It's not about "protecting" them, but about having some standards before making accusations. To put it in perspective, I could make all kinds of accusations about Hearn being an intelligence spy and being in Bitcoin only to disrupt it from within with blacklists and redlists and creating disunity in the community. Hearn was already a member of the UK agency QinetiQ, so I could argue it pretty easily. Would that help, or be constructive? No. Unless there was specific evidence, it would be better not to say any such thing. Same idea with Blockstream, et. al.

I'm not really interested in 'fame or fortune' as the saying goes. Can we just focus on the question, and figure that out first? I still don't understand where, in reality, the common ground exists.
Many Ethereum core devs are intent on talking badly about Bitcoin, and criticizing aspects of it in ways that seem unnecessary. This includes things like Bitcoin's PoW, with Vitalik and others obsessed with calling it a "waste", regardless of this idea's lack of merit. Vitalik also seems enthused lately with the idea of using Twitter to disregard Bitcoin, and Bitcoin companies like 21 even after 21's CEO graciously offered to send Vitalik a free dev kit (which Vitalik ignored). Vitalik is also obsessed with using the word 'maximalism', which is irritating to hear (plus the concept does not even make sense -- maximalism in 'money' is a natural state of affairs and reduces cognitive load for users; consumers are used to dealing with a single national currency, and part of the cool thing with bitcoin is having a single seamless global currency).
As for the Bitcoin perspective on Ethereum, the gist is that we don't think it's viable and that it's an unnecessary duplication of effort on a massively complicated boondoggle, which would be better spent helping others work to improve what already exists (Bitcoin) -- and not only already exists, but is very well established! Also, as mentioned, even if Ethereum succeeds in adding value, it can simply be turned into a Bitcoin sidechain... and that's the end of that. There are also issues of principle, such as that Ethereum's presale can be considered a very bad distribution mechanism... which is compounded by the urge to switch from PoW to PoS asap within the next 1-2 years and limit expansion of ether. I'm not sure where they expect to cap ether, but it seems that most ether will have been sold during the presale. That's a bit ridiculous, when compared to bitcoin's open model for the last 7 years (and expected to continue being open indefinitely). &lt;-- So, all this and more prevents one from even being interested in Ethereum in the first place. Bitcoin just appears to be a better system, with Ethereum not adding much (except the 'ether' altcoin).
So basically, what are you trying to accomplish? What do you think will be accomplished by this? What are your goals? Why do you think it would be beneficial for people from r/bitcoin and r/ethereum to mix and 'bridge the gap', the gap which seems naturally-induced and unlikely to be bridged due to competitive pressures?
p.s. Don't get me wrong; if you're sincere about this, that's great. I'd like the preliminary questions answered first though.

Right, I agree here. They are implementing the same consensus. And, thus, XT and Core actually do fall in the same category as btcd and libbitcoin.


This refers to Jan. 2016, when XT's code is due to activate to allow bigger blocks. When you say you "suspect", that is not enough, right? It needs to be backed by some data? What does the data say about 75/25 vs. 95/5?
I've read that 75/25 will allow the 25 chain to continue functioning for a while (a distinct possibility because of how heated and emotional this has become), which would in turn lead to massive chaos in the Bitcoin ecosystem.
In light of that, why not change XT to 95/5? I would have no issues with it then because, if the community decided to move with that much conviction, no one would be able to argue otherwise that XT was legitimate. It would also be a very smooth transition, without much disruption to Bitcoin.

Yes, but no one is being governed by Core. It's open source, you can participate in Bitcoin dev constructively and help create the protocol.
In terms of 4 year can-kick, I think this is actually ideal:
1) Predicting 20 years is a fool's errand in technology, especially in early stages of Bitcoin's development when the potential and viability of layer 2 (like LN) is not fully clear. It's not a mere can-kick, but an intentional short-term proposal to let us evaluate the landscape after 4 years.
2) It's easier to get consensus after 4 years than after 20 years. If the proposal wanted to be so long, it should have been made infinite. 20 years is worse in the consensus sense than 4 years.
Governance wise, this argument is really inane. A non-issue has been made into an issue via deceptive fancy pie charts and by a group (XT) that obviously has a conflict of interest in the whole debate. In other words, it's manufactured controversy to achieve an end.
All that will happen is the same group of people responsible for selflessly developing the protocol in the last 5 years will continue to be responsible. Is this really so bad? And this is a simplification, since anyone can join in and participate. This isn't some closed team of 'Core', the way it's made out.
Finally, there are efforts at libconsensus development to allow other implementations to safely exist. As it is, we already have others anyway: btcd and libbitcoin -- which are working concurrently with Core, and not causing any disruption for years now.

Do you have to buy XCP with BTC to use Counterparty's version, yes or no? I feel like questions are being danced around. If the answer is yes, then the user is exposed to exchange rate fluctuation, since XCP has a floating exchange rate. With sidechains and RootStock, there is no altcoin to buy and no XCP fluctuation to deal with (it's all bitcoin-currency centric). The 'roots' of RootStock also do not fluctuate and are tied to bitcoin.


I don't understand. Most likely, sidechains will be merged mined, so no new mining infra would be needed. They just tag along on bitcoin's existing mining infra. Miners would of course be incentivized to support sidechains because of their widely recognized importance to bitcoin's future value.


RootStock will be working via federated multisig 2wp on sidechains. This tech exists already. It is the fully trustless merged mined 2wp that is not ready. RootStock is due to be out by early December.

If they all follow the same consensus, then alternative implementations are desirable. The "libconsensus" effort is a step in that direction, but until it's done, people are taking a risk.
There's also the issue that the post you cited is misleading. XT is not a valid "implementation", since it doesn't follow the consensus rules unlike the actual other implementations (btcd, libbitcoin, etc.). XT instead has different consensus rules (or it will in Jan, 2016) and will split the network.
Basically, there's a distinction to be made between alternative implementations of the same consensus, and different consensus like XT.

Okay, I'm finally going to express myself clearly because frustration has been building up to such a point that I'm frankly becoming really depressed and disillusioned with the way things are going. I have tried so hard to give Mike the benefit of the doubt, but I feel now that maybe it really is pointless? Things are getting worse and worse.
With all due respect to Mike Hearn's past accomplishments (BitcoinJ, Lighthouse, Merge Avoidance, etc.), I am seriously freaking annoyed lately by his behavior. He knows so much better (obviously), yet he insists on acting like an arrogant jerk who couldn't care less if Bitcoin burns to the ground, just as long as he gets *his* way and *regardless* of how many qualified experts disagree with him.
And, when he speaks, he makes himself out to be a victim all the time ("oh everyone assassinates my character!" -- no Mike, your immature behavior does that all by itself!). I mean, how egotistical can someone be? Get over yourself, Mike. You are not Satoshi, and you need to learn to work together in a team and collaborate and compromise. This also means not in public open view telling a representative of the Chinese mining pools that, if they don't like the 20 MB block size proposal, they can get lost from Bitcoin and make their own China-specific altcoin -- yes, this actually happened.
The cherry on top? Just 2 days ago, he even clearly implied he would use checkpointing in Bitcoin XT to try to force the network to follow his way. Pure maliciousness! Without regard for Bitcoin's health and cohesion.


I'm so sick of reading how he, in one way or another, detracts from bitcoin's development these days, and has turned dev into some Kafkaesque drama filled nightmare.
Some people are busy innovating and trying to legitimately quantum leap the Bitcoin protocol (Lightning payment channels, Sidechains, Confidential Transactions, CoinJoin, r/JoinMarket, r/DropZone, all the innovative stuff presented in Montreal Scaling Bitcoin.. like Bitcoin NG sharding, and much more that I'm missing!).
But Mike? He'd rather raise hell over the fact that the vast majority of technical experts disagree with callously raising block size by 20x or 8x in one go without real legitimate transparent supporting data (Muneeb Ali mentioned dozens of times to use Planet Lab, not run simulations), and more importantly disagree with jumping to XT (and hence, ditching most of Bitcoin's real developer talent responsible for its upkeep).
The worst part? All of the above is happening IN SPITE of the fact that Gavin at the Montreal conference generously agreed to compromise with the other developers on a scalability proposal (apparently due to be released shortly).

Hi "new user".
Gavin is not my enemy, and I'm not sure how you got that from my post.
I was stating facts, and argued based on exactly what he said. I respect his contributions to Bitcoin, but that doesn't mean I'll just ignore it when he makes false arguments and simplifies a complex situation (and in the process, also mocks the community by characterizing all opposition as 'honey badger meme-ers').
If Gavin, as you say it, "shoots from the hip with things he says", then maybe... he should stop doing that, and start being more careful with his words and more thoughtful about what he says? That includes not dismissing promising technology like Lightning (because he couldn't be bothered to take the time to read up on it first), before he later (recently) took another look at it and this time praised it as part of the solution.
Being thoughtful is a *good* thing. "Shooting from the hip" is frankly idiotic, and a bad quality to have, especially for people in high positions of influence with the ability to cause a lot of collateral damage. It damages his credibility when he "shoots from the hip" (if we assume this in fact *was* shooting from the hip and not his actual position), and I hope he realizes that and changes it.

Are you saying users who reuse addresses are vulnerable, but those who do not reuse addresses are not vulnerable? If so, many users have reused addresses at some point in the last 7 years. Software these days seems to have standardized on the idea of not reusing addresses, but it's not always been the case. I hope we're not going with the idea of throwing a certain set of users under the bus?
Such a move would cause a large disruption by, if that's how quantum works, causing bitcoin to be lost. This would tank the price and disrupt faith in the system. That is bad for every single bitcoin user, regardless whether they personally reuse(d) addresses, or not.

Slander? So, first, 'slander' is 'spoken', so you mean to use the word 'libel'.
Second, you may call it 'slander', but why does it seem like people only complain about Cryptsy's exchange practices? Why can't you do a basic task, like processing withdrawals, efficiently? Why do people have to make threads like this?


Third, how can you possibly justify instituting a sudden withdrawal fee increase? Sounds like extortion of users, to me. The ethical way to do it would be to give some notice, like a 1-month notice, before raising fees out of the blue like that.
tl;dr -- If your exchange behaved in an efficient, ethical manner, then people would not be complaining. Even an anonymous, random exchange in the middle of nowhere (BTC-e) is more efficient than Cryptsy, and offers no problems to users.

I don't really know :/. I don't think anyone has really established in a data-backed, scientific way what the threshold should be. What does seem logical though is that mining is very centralized. We have ~5 big actors. In that respect, having 6,000 nodes is great.
I think the metric should be cost to compromise the network. That cost needs to be high enough to rule out attackers being incentivized to try, by making probability of success low.
I don't know if the following logic is legit, but...






All these costs need to be understood, and the system designed to raise those costs to an acceptable level (that minimizes risk 'sufficiently' -- whether that's $3 million, $100 million, $1 billion, or $10 billion or $100 billion, I don't know.)

This. It won't fix address reuse, but it would at least still hide all transaction amounts, and so counter the problem from a different angle and help compensate. Unfortunately, I think transactions are ~10-15x larger with CT, so block size would have to increase to 10-15 MB just to be in the same position as we are today.
But, u/nullc and others are hard at work trying to optimize CT.

Personally, I don't understand the attraction with Ethereum. It can be replicated with  or alternatively by Counterparty (which cloned Ethereum). Ethereum technology is fine, but there's no need to use the 'ether' token which is based on a highly experimental, unfinished, new system that lacks the security/credibility of Bitcoin. Ether was also part of an IPO, which distributed most of the coins in one go. I can't see how that kind of distribution is credible, when compared to Bitcoin's distribution.

I really like your post... :). $1
I might disagree, but still the post is: 1) logical, 2) fact-based and includes some evidence, 3) clearly written.
Onto the post... I would not have imagined that transactions would be pushed into altcoins for the purpose of "cheaper transactions". I'm also still skeptical that this premise is true. Looking at Prohashing's website, they write:


So, right off the bat, they say "any coin" and later, they also write:


Also, note that they mine using scrypt. This means altcoins, in fact 65% Litecoin. So, it's not surprising they would pay out LTC. Finally, they have a hashrate of 21 GH... :/, or 21 / 466,000,000 * 100 = 0.0000045% of BTC hashrate. This is basically 0, and places their importance as 0. They may as well not exist, and the universe would not care, lol.
So, simply based on all this, I think it's fair to reject that evidence, and hence the premise of the post that transactions would get pushed into altcoins to "take advantage of cheaper block space".
There are also logical arguments that would suggest it's not going to happen...
* Block space fundamentally has a cost. There is no free lunch in this world (except for Dorian). Either the cost is decentralization (so we have powerful, centralized servers that deliver high performance overall), or the cost is centralization (so we have weaker, decentralized servers/nodes that deliver low performance overall).
* If block space is cheaper on an altcoin, then again, there is no free lunch. The reason is likely that the altcoin has weaker security, which of course is the case with LTC vs. BTC.
Basically, there are no easy answers. If one side of this debate wants to frame the discussion as if there is an easy answer, then it's just false. The side is ignoring something.
Regardless, it doesn't mean best choice to move forward is to sit on our hands and do nothing. We need a sensible compromise that clearly reflects the fact that *there is no free lunch*, for both sides. We want performance, but we also want decentralization. We need something that exists in between, and not just in name only, but *really* and truly something that is supported by data &amp; logic.
@_date: 2015-10-08 13:40:18
I hope so. It seems very obvious to me that a short-term solution is optimal, rather than trying to predict 20 years down the line. Intense development is occurring in these early years, so these early years need to be treated as experimental and allow changes to be made. A 4 year proposal takes this into account, while a 20 year proposal does not.
Further, it's easier to make changes after 4 than 20 years. Why can kick 20 years? The proposal should have been to stretch on infinitely, so that the entire community does not need consensus yet again in 20 years.
Do you agree with all this? Curious if it's logical or illogical, in your opinion.

Like I said, he's the first person who actually did it. Being an 'ideas guy' is great, but executing is a different matter. His action, either malicious, or benign due to 'boredom', has helped the Bitcoin network recognize a flaw so it can be fixed. I think that is worthy of recognition. It's great this was identified now, instead of at a future time when the network is experiencing much higher transaction volumes (and thus higher potential for the flaw to cause greater disruption).

@_date: 2015-11-28 15:14:33
But we're not after "less impossible". We want reasonable and viable (i.e. maintain or improve network security and censorship-resistance). Expanding block size to huge levels might allow a certain size of micro transactions, but at what cost? Costs &amp; trade-offs are extremely important and consequential. There is never going to be a free lunch, but people just want to ignore that reality and externalize those costs or simply pretend they don't exist.
Btw, you can even hypothetically expand block size as much as you want, but you will still not hypothetically get LN-level of micro transactions, i.e. down to the satoshi level.
@_date: 2015-11-12 00:25:22
It's not responsible to suggest anyone is 'compromised'. Good faith needs to be assumed, unless there is specific evidence and a case can be built showing otherwise.
Gavin's behavior, in my humble opinion, is one of someone who does not like complex technology and is naturally averse to it. For instance, he downplayed or ignored Lightning for quite a while, even though everyone else was clearly excited about it. It was only recently that he took the time to understand it more deeply, and now he too appreciates its potential.
I don't think Gavin is 'compromised', although it's possible his views are not as 'strong' (an argument that does not assume compromise would be that maybe Gavin is naive about threats and assumes lower security level is still okay) as that of others in regards to decentralization and/or anonymity and/or security. e.g. I've literally seen Gavin say he is okay with a more centralized future (my paraphrasing of what I remember him saying). I'm trying to not read too much into it though, so I can continue to give Gavin the benefit of the doubt, since I see Gavin sort of constructively engaging Core devs regarding scalability.
Someone who is compromised is not going to be so transparent about his views. There will be deception instead, such that actions are all that can be looked to for evidence, since words probably won't reveal much. Similarly, I don't think Mike is compromised; his views just differ very widely from the others.

This sounds good in theory, but I can't help but feel that practically, it's a recipe for disaster. Financial assets really work based on confidence. If the market loses confidence in Bitcoin's ability to handle itself in a coherent, synchronized manner, then the price is going to crash (along with users leaving, investment leaving, companies leaving, etc. etc., not to mention competing cryptos emerging to try to take its place).
The other issue is that Brian has never been transparent about scaling nor about what he sees as the problems. Has he attended Scaling Bitcoin? If not, why not? Has he discussed actual pros and cons of BIP 101? Not from what I've seen. He just throws around amorphous statements like "BIP 101 is the best we have seen".

There should always, always, always be a Plan B, for every situation. Great idea. Redundancy really should be built into everything.

Well, I can't really argue against such a diplomatic argument, now can I? :) But, my personal opinion is that the majority of value will in fact converge onto bitcoin -- and it already has in the past and the present, as bitcoin consistently averages ~89% of cryptocurrency market cap, or ~92% if you exclude Ripple (premined, centralized, regulated). So, my argument is based on the last 7 years of cryptocurrency history. And if anything, current developments are only increasing the likelihood that this will continue.
To argue another way, I think cryptocurrency is different than the other categories you mentioned. Cryptocurrency is inherently about money and value. People should naturally tend to move towards holding their value in that which is most valuable. Value stored with something intangible like digital cryptocurrency, which sometimes can feel ephemeral, should be based on security. I think it's very difficult to argue that Bitcoin is less secure than any competing cryptocurrency, based on a number of factors. One factor is it's been around the longest, so it has "accumulated security" and a great deal of testing, over that period of time. So, while other currencies may experiment, at the end of the day people will want to store majority of value in the most secure and conservative chain, i.e. Bitcoin. As value accumulates, it also incentivizes continued maintenance and improvement, leading to continuous improvement and incentivizing yet more value to be stored within.

I think *minrelaytxfee* refers to fee/1000 bytes. I know, I was confused too; the nomenclature is a bit misleading.
With minrelaytxfee=0.00005, a tx that is x bytes will need a fee larger than 0.00005/(1/0.x) = 0.00005 * 0.x BTC (or 5,000 * 0.x satoshis) to be relayed by nodes.
When you mention a fee of 0.000025 BTC, you should contextualize it in terms of how many bytes the tx in question is. Breadwallet, for example, has only gone as low as 42 bits (4,200 satoshis) with a 225 byte tx, for me. This is above the threshold (5,000*0.225 = 1,125 satoshis).

A serious response: This does not make sense. Convincing one person here, with likely little investable funds to move the market, amounts to nothing. The only way price increases is with consistent buying pressure, which is only achieved by many people investing a little or a few people investing vast sums. Thus, there's basically no incentive for people here to be spending cognitive effort trying to convince some random person to buy bitcoin. It's just a chance for individuals to reveal their own personal opinion of how much they think is a good amount to invest.

Hi Brian, would you mind commenting on this thread? I posted here:


I pinged your username multiple times in the message there, as well as multiple names before this in your previous thread (where I simply asked for clarification).
I'd appreciate your involvement, thanks.
Also, as regards u/theymos, while I disagree with the policy to censor XT (even if he disagrees, free and open discussion should always occur), it cannot be denied u/theymos has proven himself to be a trusted member of the Bitcoin community for the last 7 years (or since whenever he arrived on the scene). Inciting insurrection against him is not the wisest of actions, if you care about Bitcoin's health. I'm sure most longterm Bitcoin members would agree that u/theymos has a very good history (outside of this XT incident).
On the other hand, Roger Ver has refused to change policy with respect to promoting wallets on his bitcoin.com site. He charges money to make wallets more visible, instead of operating based on bitcoin.org's principle of a meritocracy. This may lead to longterm damage to Bitcoin, as users may lose their money from inferior coded wallets. This is immoral, IMO. Besides this, however, Roger has shown he can be altruistic and funded many Bitcoin projects.
Still, comparing u/theymos to Roger, I think it's clear u/theymos has a proven track record of always trying to do what is best for Bitcoin, regardless of potential monetary gain. Many important former figures trusted him enough to give him control of major Bitcoin platforms.

What you're saying is technically true, but practically false. Bitcoin Core is what Bitcoin is, and it is in fact "governed" (you can pick another word if you like) by consensus among Core devs. XT represents a very real 'governance coup', i.e. if Hearn became de facto 'benevolent dictator' of Bitcoin (via XT), then there is high probability of key Core devs leaving Bitcoin (it was actually close to happening a few months ago, when the XT drama was at its highest, and various devs were becoming very disillusioned). If you think such an event could possibly be good for Bitcoin, then by all means continue to support a blatant fork of the network that most Bitcoin developers and miners (and clearly, even influential onlookers like Tyler Durden of ZeroHedge) are strongly against.

Misrepresenting spam as legit users is not framing the argument in an honest way.

I don't agree that it's transparent (I wrestled with this question before posting my previous reply to you, actually). The reason is the thread title remains an obvious clickbait. For whatever reason, maybe because he thinks people will see the tweet and not bother clicking the link inside it, he decided to add a comment suggesting to read the article itself too. I think this implies he didn't want to directly link the article, so he did so in a round-about manner by linking a tweet with the article link inside.
Basically, I just don't like dishonesty and deception. It's 'slimy' and does not lend credibility.
I would have preferred if he could just link the article, if that was the main point, and have the title of the thread be the name of the article (Roger Ver: There Has Been a Lot of Suppression of Ideas on Bitcoin Forums). If he thought it was too controversial to do that, or that it wouldn't get attention, well then that's still not an excuse to obfuscate to achieve the same end goal.

By the way, I know Roger's accomplishments and his contributions to Bitcoin (he is currently funding one of the most innovative yet abstract Bitcoin projects IMO, "Truthcoin" -- so kudos to him for recognizing its potential and funding it!).

I'm not forgetting, I'm suggesting that we can filter this class of spam by setting a minimum satoshis/byte fee rate (maybe something like 10 satoshis/byte?), rather than the other idea floating around of raising the minimum fee/tx.


Okay, don't belittle me, Mike. I have read clearly what you said.
I understand that it will be majority spam txs that are removed, but is it 100%? If not, then what % for various examples? Legit txs will randomly be dropped here and there, which is bad for customer satisfaction, isn't it? How is it a good idea for Bitcoin users to pay a normal fee, and then suddenly discover their transaction never made it?
Currently, anyone using the system with proper knowledge of paying a normal fee, or using a wallet that auto-calculates a normal fee, is guaranteed to have their txs be processed (when considering this type of low satoshi/byte spam attack). Predictability = good experience. Why make a predictable system unpredictable?


Huh? Visa has centralized servers and can deal with tens of thousands of txs/sec without a worry. This is because they optimize for txs/sec and not for a censorship-resistant system.
So, I'd argue that *yes* Bitcoin is especially inefficient compared with other payment systems and that it is "inefficient on purpose" (in order to protect censorship resistance). In what way? We have proof-of-work that makes it very costly, like $10/transaction when including the mining subsidy. And, we have 3,600 bitcoins a day being mined and inflating the money supply, as well as a massively energy-intensive 450 PH mining network. We also have a large p2p node network instead of high-performance centralized servers (which are unwanted because centralization = easy target for regulation).
Visa has none of these concerns, hence we realistically can never even hope to approach Visa (unless the magical Lightning Network really works and can be successful).


Satoshi also described Bitcoin as: "A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution".
Peer-to-peer cash... not centralized-server model.
Further, his purpose, as seen by the genesis block message, was to create a new financial system separate from the current fiat financial system. He did not create a mere "payment system" but a cryptocurrency that could exist on its own.


Again, lots of ad hominem here and negative emotion, care to be polite? Or, is it character assassination when someone criticizes you, but perfectly acceptable in your eyes for you to speak badly of other people?
I did not say "Bitcoin sucks" and I did not say I "dont want Bitcoin to be successful". Something that exists outside of regulators and allow money to be sent freely, in any amount, to any person on Earth, is not something that "sucks". What "sucks" is the current fiat system (banks, processors like Visa, Paypal, etc.).
Also, everyone wants Bitcoin to be used. That's why Lightning has its design goals to be able to efficiently serve 7 billion people with close to unlimited transactions per person. There is potentially a way to have a decentralized p2p Bitcoin system (LN operates on routing txs through LN nodes) *and* allow for massive usage of Bitcoin.
To demonize the 'other side' as thinking that Bitcoin sucks and wanting to keep it suck-ey and unsuccessful is pretty unconstructive. I agree a small minority sometimes talks in a way that is inconsiderate of customer satisfaction, but even Luke... has said now that he can support Wuille's BIP to increase block size 17% per year (based on Cisco's end-user bandwidth increase estimates for next 5 years).

Personally, I think functionality supporting JM making + taking is most important:
1. Incentivize creation of Takers -- Send every transaction as a CoinJoin. ; Rationale: Much improved privacy, at very low cost, automatically ; Cost example: Sending $10 = 0.01%*10 = 0.001 ; To send $10, it costs 1/10 of 1 cent. To send a CoinJoin via 10 parties, assuming it then costs 1/10 of 1 cent * 10 = 1 cent. // Paying 1 cent to send $10 (or 0.1% fee) properly anonymized (assuming 10 parties qualifies) sounds amazing, although it could get irritating as you send higher amounts, because CoinJoin fee is variable (%-based), while bitcoin tx fee is fixed. So, the optimal # of CoinJoin parties (after factoring in diminishing returns) should be determined, to minimize cost. Also, hopefully greater usage (including usage via mixing with more parties rather than less), and ease of use to be a maker, should keep costs down?
2. Incentivize creation of Makers -- Yield generator is essential, because it ensures ease of use for people to contribute back to the network and ensure a greater anonymity set. It's not just about investment and making profit. JoinMarket needs both: makers + takers.
If  can be guaranteed to work well in all cases, then maybe being able to do a manual 1-time CoinJoin would be unnecessary and redundant. If not, if there are use cases uncovered, then it would be great to also have the 1-time ability.
BTW, are JoinMarket CJs instant? Or, how long do they take? If not very quick, then maybe they can't be used for all of a user's transactions. A UI showing progress of a JM CJ transaction would be very nice, if the tx is not instant.

Yeah, you may be right about it only activating IFF 75% support the change.
I think the disagreement over XT involves a few factors: 1) Governance change from 'consensus model' to Hearn as 'benevolent dictator', and does not make any attempt to bring Core devs over -- it just seemingly leaves them high and dry, which is horrible for Bitcoin's future, and 2) 75/25 split is deemed too vague and not representing 'overwhelming' consensus based on historic precedent (I believe soft forks typically require 95%) -- 95/5 for miners is recommended.
Because of these reasons, XT is considered hostile and not in Bitcoin's overall best interest. With a conclusion like this, especially factor  (if 95/5, then it would indeed represent consensus and the 5% left over would be a small enough minority not to disrupt the overall system), you can imagine why r/bitcoin mods have their policy in place.
See this for the above put into different words:

It was removed for off-topicness in the scaling thread, which has in its rules "stay on topic" -- we were discussing censorship, so that's clearly off-topic. The rule makes sense since mods want the thread to actually discuss scaling. If anything, this proves there is not meaningless censorship going on.

We have 3 miners with: 20%, 18%, 15% (BitFury). BitFury is about to invest $100 million USD into a new mining farm. RIP mining decentralization?
For context, BW recently made their 14nm miners available to the public, at the rate of $77,000 for 1 PH. $100 million divided by $77,000 for 1 PH, as a very back of the envelope calculation, gives ~1,300 PH. The current Bitcoin hashrate is 450 PH. BitFury currently has about 70 PH. Including the 1,300 PH, BitFury would then control ~78% of hashrate. Even if, for whatever reason, we cut the estimate in half, that would still mean BitFury controls ~40% of Bitcoin hashrate.

By miner fee, I don't mean block reward, but users' 'transaction fees'. Instead of those fees going 100% to miners, it could be split based on whatever is the optimal amount.

Bitcoin distribution operates via the free market mechanism. People are free to buy and sell anytime they wish. Those who buy earlier when risk is higher have the potential to reap higher rewards. Those who buy relatively later when risk is lower will reap lower rewards. The end result will be a merit-based distribution that is as fair as realistically possible.

u/elanthius mentioned this as one of the downsides. Has there been any research or efforts underway, to decrease this risk or eliminate it? Example: by adding an extra layer of security for those funds, such as multisig or 2FA.

Wow? These tweets are just embarrassing in their lack of understanding. I'm really surprised to see Green making such statements, and so recently.
On the other hand, contrast with these prior tweets regarding Zerocash:




Zooko is quite involved with the Bitcoin community, so I think it bodes well. And, Green's statement says "for now", which sounds conciliatory re: a future sidechain. The other aspect is the Zerocash work will undoubtedly be open-source (otherwise it can't be taken legitimately), so yeah... it's being turned into a sidechain, regardless of Green's apparent lack of understanding of: how *any* free market works &amp; how proof-of-work works.
BTW, if Zerocash does not emerge, we can always go with a cryptonote sidechain (once that tech has properly matured and been tested in the interim)... plus we have fallback option, of a combo of non-interactive CoinJoin or JoinMarket + Confidential Transactions (once optimized and tradeoffs are worth it).

You might understand people's irritation with Gavin, if you understand that this latest example is not the only time this has happened. It's the main public example, but Bitcoin developers have been dealing with Gavin's naivete and hand-waving away of security concerns for many years now (which culminated in Gavin leaving Core to make his own Bitcoin fork with Mike Hearn -- XT -- and then leading development of Classic). There is a lot of backstory to this "Gavin is a dumbass for being fooled" view that many here have :).

Not just this. I could get into more, but to summarize, deflationary currency is good for the world as a whole. It necessarily means less consumption and more savings, which means more meaningful consumption based on merit and financially-healthier consumers (thus a more stable system). This higher quality consumption leads to higher quality production and greater efficiency. We have a system of finite resources, so these effects are actually welcomed instead of proceeding on a path that incorrectly assumes infinite resources (hence, a path that will inevitably lead to a crash at some point).

tokenless permissioned ledger = making back-end operations of existing banks more efficient
Fedcoin cryptocurrency permissioned ledger = central banks taking over banks' current role in money supply (a form of disintermediation), and out-competing digital dollars (credit cards, ACH, SEPA, wires, debit cards, etc.) with a much more efficient 'managed' Fedcoin cryptocurrency

Yes, and those percentage examples *are not 100%*. My point is it will *never* be 100% with this idea, so legit txs will be dropped. That is what I was getting at. The concern is whether that's acceptable to the users' experience, or not. It feels like it wouldn't be acceptable to have even 0.5% chance of dropping legit txs, when the current system does a great job processing every legit tx paying a legit fee (which makes its behavior predictable; predictability is a good thing).
And you can choose to "not waste any more time on this", but I presented a lot more arguments in the post on separate issues. I'll take your lack of response to those arguments, and in fact cherry picking of a single line, as your tacit agreement with me on those points.
So, for example, I hope to not see any more comparisons about how Bitcoin's competitor is Visa, since I've emphasized how Satoshi wanted a p2p network, not some centralized &amp; regulated Visa b.s.. -- and your lack of response to it implies you see the mistake and agree.

That's not what he is saying. I got confused at first too.
Here's his statement regarding 'blockchain':


 (the actual blog post)
He's wondering if blockchain technology can allow users to move from one tech service to another without being "locked in", thereby breaking the existing "winner take all" model in tech (like Google, Facebook, etc.) that is based on network effect. What he is saying has nothing to do with bitcoin.
Of course, ironically enough, 'blockchain' itself also has everything to do with network effect. Bitcoin may be an open protocol (the difference between Bitcoin vs. Google or Facebook), but its dominance is due to network effect. The cool thing is 'shares' in Bitcoin (i.e. bitcoins) are freely available to the public pre-IPO, i.e. before Bitcoin emerges as a 'finished' polished product.
@_date: 2015-10-03 18:13:04
I'm not sure I understand. Currently, the status quo is not great, but okay. If suddenly bandwidth can be throttled, then you'll inevitably see some nodes on the network reduce their bandwidth contribution... which will degrade service. Or, are you assuming that new nodes can be assumed to join once they know that they can throttle, and that these nodes' bandwidth will probably make up for the loss?

I don't think this will do much. Fees are apparently as low as 1 satoshi. Miners won't recoup lost revenue from this.


Sure, but the network needs to be designed with the future in mind. Three more halvings (9 yrs) and miner coin base compensation will decrease by nearly 10x. Either miner fees will compensate, or bitcoin price will have risen enough to compensate.


I don't think we should rely on a LN weakness as a reason why on-chain transactions will still be used. The weakness should instead be addressed.

Wait, let's be clear. No one says sidechain currencies *are* bitcoin, neither I nor u/bashco. Obviously, they are not. That's what makes sidechains amazing! We can have completely different blockchains than bitcoin, and yet have bitcoin and the sidechain interoperate smoothly. What we say (and what everyone else says who likes sidechains) is that sidechain tokens peg their value to bitcoin. In other words, even though a sidechain's token is not technically 'bitcoin', in terms of "currency" and value, a sidechain's token is the same as bitcoin.

I really dislike price speculation, especially from Bitcoin business leaders. It's very unprofessional. A common adage in markets is that the opposite will happen to what is expected. In this case, if everyone expects it will happen, everyone will anticipate and wait for price to start rising... but it won't rise, since everyone is just waiting for it to begin rising. For price to truly rise, I think it will only happen when the reason behind the rise is unexpected. Obviously, in the case of the halving, it's an expected phenomenon and known to occur every 4 years (so it should be priced in).

At the same time, there may be hope for VCs! Great companies often have a good idea at their core. If innovative ideas are developed and mature (akin to having lots of Bitcoin 'tech demos'), then it's possible new companies will spring up, using those ideas in isolation or in combination with other ideas, providing investment opportunities for VCs.
Or, the other theory is that Bitcoin is at its best when it leverages Bitcoin's true nature (permissionless free currency). If so, then maybe VC just isn't compatible with a lot of Bitcoin's uses.

No offense, but this isn't really the definition of innovative. Loading a prepaid card with cryptocurrency, which means selling bitcoin and buying USD (by paying $10 + 1.5% to load the card = 11.5% fee to load $100, or 2.5% fee to load $1,000) is so blasé, not to mention a rip-off. One can already sell their bitcoin for fiat for a 0-1% charge (Circle processes BTC-USD conversion to debit card at 0% charge), so why pay between 2.5-11.5%?
When Adam Draper says he is disappointed with some bitcoin companies, I bet this is what he means. Too many companies are obsessed with trying to "fit a round peg into a square hole" (i.e. fitting bitcoin into legacy financial systems).
Rather, companies should be innovating and doing things only possible with bitcoin (first and foremost a censorship-proof, capital control-free, cryptographically-secured digital currency). [Truthcoin]( (decentralized prediction market) is a great example, as is [Streamium]( / [Faradam]( (pay-per-second for services, microtransactions), [BitMarkets]( (p2p market with 2-party escrow) or r/DropZone (decentralized free market operating on top of the Bitcoin protocol, and able to be integrated into Bitcoin wallets), [CardCash]( (takes advantage of inefficiency in buying and selling gift cards to provide benefit to both buyers and sellers), [21's Bitcoin Computer]( (software and hardware integration to facilitate bitcoin micropayments &amp; IoT), and r/JoinMarket (smart contract-based, [incentivized]( CoinJoin).

Not to harp on this this point, but "1MB proponents" represents a false argument. At this point, basically no one (not even Luke), proposes 1 MB block sizes. This is a meme circulated by people in XT. I'm a bit shocked it's still being circulated, since it's blatantly false (and hence dishonest to keep repeating it).


Core recently announced various changes to how they intend to deal with spam attacks. I don't have a link handy. The changes looked quite interesting, though.
How does it take away revenue from miners to increase minrelaytxfee? That increases revenue for miners.
For users who pay too little, they will have a bad experience, correct. What is the alternative? Increase block sizes at an unsustainable rate that causes centralization of the network, and more easily regulated to oblivion by governments? That argument is a non-starter. I think the problem will resolve itself, as wallet software improves and auto-calculates the best fee based on demand. Most good wallets are already doing this, actually. There needs to be a way to filter out spam transactions, and requiring a certain fee is the best way known to do that (while still maintaining a decentralized cryptocurrency).
Anyway, I recommend you dig up Core's ideas for managing the mempool to get the full details. I think they want to let the user limit their mempool size. This would prevent crashing due to overloaded RAM.
I know you dislike fee market solution, but there is no free lunch in the real world. Right? The free market puts a price on everything. In this case, transactions require a miner fee. Miners require that fee in order to keep their mining going and secure the network. As coinbase rewards half, miner fee becomes ever more important to sustaining the system.
The fee cannot be allowed to get too high, of course. That's equally bad.


Isn't this wrong? A smaller block size means fee market emerges and fees will trend higher. This means miner profits increase, or at least compensate declining coinbase rewards.


How? Bigger blocks means more supply for same demand. That means lower fees.
If you mean more supply = allow more demand via more transactions, then okay, but there is no guarantee of getting all those extra transactions. What guarantee is there for "build it and they will come"?
Also, again, keep in mind decentralization effects. Look at BitFury's analysis.


This seems like incredible exaggeration and possibly completely wrong. Proof?

But isn't this saying the attack isn't viable, since a bad solution exists? Isn't that illogical? This implies SPV mining is not a 'real' solution.


I just told you that data caps do exist in North America. Canada has abominable home internet connections, since their telecom industry is a monopoly. The US is marginally better, but we have data caps too (as I detailed in prior post).

And yet, paradoxically, Litecoin retains its position of 2-3% of bitcoin's value, and mirror's bitcoin's price fluctuations. It's insane. Some say it's understandable from a gold/silver perspective, but it doesn't logically make sense due to cryptocurrency's differentiating characteristics, imo. But that's the lingering argument, and I guess I can't argue because the market has decided over several years now that that's the way it is going to be.

Dimon misses the point that bitcoin is already being adopted and evangelized by countless billionaires (few examples: Marc Andreessen, Richard Branson, Jim Breyer, Wences Cesares, Reid Hoffman, Bill Miller, Chamath P., Winklevii Twins, Draper, Dee Hock) and people of high status within US government (Larry Summers, Sheila Blair, etc.) and business (Andreessen Horowitz and 21 have connections with many large US networking companies like Cisco, Broadcom, etc.). Surely you have read that the U.S. is partially on its way to an oligarchy? Well, that comes with its benefits, as regards Bitcoin. Just because Dimon personally is a rich guy who doesn't enjoy the idea of Bitcoin, does not mean there aren't plenty of other rich guys who *do* like the idea of a privatized money.
Not to mention, Wences of Xapo estimates there are 13-15 million users of Bitcoin globally. I'd like to see government try to ban something with popular support. It did not work with Uber and Airbnb (worth tens of billions), and it's not going to work with Bitcoin.
And what if Bitcoin is "banned"? So what? Another currency will be used, which will be designed to be even harder to ban and far more anonymous. Does Dimon really want to incentivize such a thing, by having an otherwise fairly transparent system like Bitcoin banned?

Hmm, lol. I am still neutral though, in the sense that all I care about is Bitcoin keeping its soul and moving forward on the basis of truth and technical merit, as well as practical realities.
I mean, I had previously discarded the idea that a fork would be practical because I hadn't imagined it could survive. Thus, I behaved with the idea that current Bitcoin is the only possible answer, and so the community must work together and do its best to come to a compromise, no matter what. Even if the compromise was less than perfect, there was no viable alternative.
After your comment though, I thought about it again and realized that maybe it's possible it could indeed not only survive, but thrive in the event of a fork (due to supermajority of technical talent, lots of miner sympathy towards Core --&gt; and due to all this, possibly even leverage over existing VCs and rest of ecosystem, in the sense that if so many devs and miners coordinate and threaten to leave and present a credible plan for doing so, then existing system will be forced to have a better attitude and negotiate). If it's possible the end result is that 'new' Bitcoin is valued by the market with a m-cap of at least $1 billion (if we say that represents a decent size), then I'd define that as success.
I think if it's to be considered though, there would have to be a lot of research and preparation done beforehand that can ultimately create some sort of white paper summarizing the plan (to answer all the questions in my post, as well as whatever else, including: how bootstrapping of network will work, whether and how to change protocol fundamentally -- whether to change all crypto to be quantum resistant, whether to introduce segregated witness and other new tech -- do we care for backwards compatibility with existing infrastructure, etc. etc.), consultation with all major Bitcoin-related entities (including whales like Winklevii, miners, businesses, 21, VCs, thought leaders, etc.) and some sort of process to incorporate everyone's feedback into a revised white paper plan.
This also includes planning to figure out a way for everyone in the new project to communicate efficiently, in a private / secure / trustless manner (some sort of sybil-resistant, decentralized-Reddit might be best) -- so no more normal Reddit, Twitter, Mailing list, normal emails, etc. Secure communication would have to be foundational, due to the 'new Bitcoin' project's nature and due to the desire to avoid the problems encountered in the first iteration (vulnerability to community pressure / interference / libel - from r/bitcoinxt, Hearn, etc.).
In other words, only if all aspects can be taken care of, and a viable plan that results in a thriving 'new Bitcoin' can be implemented, do I think it's a good idea to move in that direction. If it will just end up becoming a $10 (or even $50 or $100) million market cap altcoin, then I would still say it's a pointless exercise, because that means it may lack critical mass of network effect that is needed for security and other reasons.
Let me also add one more thing! If this 'fork' succeeds (and stays true to itself), then one could imagine that Satoshi makes some move to further legitimize the fork and de-legitimize 'old Bitcoin'. This may be something as drastic as sending his 1 million coins to exchanges to liquidate them (thereby crashing the price of 'old Bitcoin') and using the resulting funds to acquire 'new Bitcoin' (thereby bootstrapping its value).
p.s. Thanks for the link. I'll read through it carefully, and see if I change my mind in any way.

Yes, and I said as much in a different post just now. I even said it at the end of this post you replied to (hoping we're not all being lied to). But, from my extensive reading about Bitcoin and talking to many different people and looking at what many different players think, I think there is vastly higher probability that my conclusions are correct. I am really scared about the current situation, as a result. I'm hoping that Reddit is not representative of the wider ecosystem, or Bitcoin will be fcuked (inevitable civil war).


Are you implying that a majority of people have a different conclusion from me? Which people are these? Redditors? And/or, people of actual significance, like: miners, exchanges, processors, VCs, large investors, Bitcoin devs with a high number of commits, etc.?

To address this concern, I think you you need to round up all ecosystem participants, especially developers, and have everyone develop strategies to not let "a storm of emotional negativity" affect them. Imagine a malicious actor that purposely stirred up drama in Bitcoin forums and chat. Bitcoin needs to become immune to such social tricks! I know it's asking a lot, as humans are not robots, but there really needs to be measures taken to pro-actively prepare for malicious situations (not only social), in order to insulate oneself from its negative effects. Emergency response systems need to be developed, too.
Example measure:
Hire talented PR people to be intermediary between devs and public. Let developers concentrate only on development. The devs can interact with the PR people only, so as to reduce exposure to negative external environment (assuming external social environment attack). -- This example strategy of course depends on the level of quality of the PR people that are hired. Such people must be very resilient, very good communicators, very good listeners, and of course good at speaking with the developers and understanding the technical material too.
It sounds dramatic maybe, but we've seen the negative effects already during this, let's assume, non-intentionally-malicious situation. (I think various key developers became depressed and unable to do any work for a length of time).
@_date: 2015-10-07 17:24:20

Bitcoin is even more permissionless than cash, one aspect of which means even children can use bitcoin for transactions. If it's so easy and simple to use, I can imagine a mainstream scenario where kids make bets with each other or send small quantities of bitcoin among each other for various other reasons.
In that case, I don't think it's wise to exclude children, at least those above age 10, let's say.
It's estimated ~15-20% of global population (1.1-1.5 billion) is currently under the age of 10, while ~0.2 billion are 75 or older (and probably will not touch bitcoin anytime soon), so that leaves conservatively 7.4-1.5-0.2 = 5.7 billion people who would theoretically use bitcoin:




In terms of non-individuals (companies, etc.), they may be making lots more transactions than individuals, but LN solves the issue, right? With LN, we're concerned about number of entities, not number of transactions (since once a channel is opened, a virtually limitless number of transactions can be made?).
So, tl;dr, maybe it's worth considering number of businesses in the world and adding it to world population, and using that sum as the potential number of bitcoin users?
A quick search shows estimates of small and medium businesses + large businesses adding up globally to about 200 million. That's not nearly as many as I expected, only 0.2 billion (but maybe they will "punch above their weight" by potentially using LN faster than individuals will? who knows).
World population minus those younger than 10 minus those older than 75 plus all businesses = 5.7+0.2 = 5.9 = ~6 billion entities


Why/how does it take 5 txs to set up a new wallet?


It's dangerous to take 3 TPS for granted. Lag time for confirmation seems to increase exponentially as you pass from 2 TPS to 3 TPS:


But yes, that's another issue. Tradeblock's analysis is based on mean tx size (600 bytes), while you're saying LN tx size is about 300 bytes. And current median tx size is 258 bytes, according to:


Although, for the record, I think Tradeblock's analysis is sophisticated and probably uses the right number. I don't think they decided to go with mean instead of median for no reason. See their conclusions and reasoning:
1. At current TPS of 1.2, the wait time for a transaction to be verified (secondary axis) is negligible, at 0.07 blocks (implying roughly 7% of transactions have to wait more than the current block). Note, in Part 1, we highlighted that ~20% of transactions were above 725KB at present, which coincides with the fact that 16% of blocks that are assumed to be full, per the chart above.
2. It appears transaction confirmation will begin to experience notable delays at roughly 2.3 TPS – the rate at which average transaction processing time begins to exceed 1 block.
3. At ~3.0 TPS, roughly the theoretical limit, under current network protocol, the average wait time would equate to roughly 20 blocks.
4. In reality, the network is likely to experience significant delays well before the theoretical limit (3 TPS) is reached.


Right, so based on the practical case of probably having to service 6 billion people (as of 2015), it's probably unnecessary. But, I've saved the best for last!
What about machines/devices in IoT? Would they also have to open and close LN channels? I don't want to imagine how many... Cisco says 50 billion devices by 2020:


Do we need to account for those 50 billion? If added to individuals and businesses, it means **56 billion entities to be serviced by 2020.**
The calculations, assuming we want to scale according to the 2.3 TPS limit (equals waiting 1 block for confirmation), are daunting:






This equates to 332%/year growth rate in block size, while the most aggressive growth rates only work out to ~42%/year.
Obviously, we can't grow block size by 332%/year, but then what can be the solution? Or, is it not a problem?

If this was true in the practical sense (real world sense), then we would have millions of people running nodes. If we do not, then we need to figure out why not, and change what is needed to produce that effect.
Also, it's not only about node decentralization, but also miner decentralization.


Why not use that argument? Can you defend why either larger miners won't exploit this to their advantage, or why malicous attackers will not exploit this opening to compromise the network?

@_date: 2015-10-03 18:56:07








No offense, but your post was highly repetitive, saying the same thing over and over again. Anyway, I've highlighted the basic issue you are concerned about, above.
I think you need to consider that your opinion of "what gives Bitcoin value" is not necessarily correct. It's just an opinion. The way you state it in your post though, it would appear you think it's a fact.
Trace Mayer, [here]( offers a different answer from you to the issue you raise:


If one considers Bitcoin is inherently a permission-less (aka, regulator-free, capital controls-free, censorship-free) digital currency, then Trace's view of what gives Bitcoin value is the correct one. This is because people will be expected to invest in bitcoins (which gives it value) for those aforementioned purposes, like:
* to make wealth portable and escape a dictatorial country
* to buy things that are deemed illegal (recreational drugs, cheaper pharmaceuticals from abroad, etc.)
* to send money to family or friends overseas without being restricted
* to donate money to people without being restricted
* etc.
Incidentally, Elon Musk (probably one of the clearest thinkers and best thinkers of our time) said the same thing ("primarily a means of doing illegal transactions", "useful for legal and illegal transactions"):




Note that all these use cases require very strong decentralization properties for Bitcoin. In other words, it must be able to resist attempts by government to police it and exert control.. the same way BitTorrent has been free to be used globally.

Hi Elizabeth, some more questions, although I understand it's very much a work in progress and in flux (I want to ask these questions now itself actually *because* it's subject to change, so that design can be molded if needed):
1. Can Lightning transactions be mapped and explored, i.e. is a Lightning 'block' explorer possible? Or, are LN transactions ephemeral and only transient?
2. Relating to  is a user's Lightning address static or does it change? Is the address private, in the sense that unlike Bitcoin addresses, a user can share just one LN address and still maintain privacy (is a LN address functionally a stealth address)? -- Is it possible to open a channel (in order to join the LN), then use your LN address to transact with anyone else who also has a LN address? If everyone just has a LN address, then what reason is there to ever close a channel (since it costs a miner fee)? If someone has coins in a LN address, then suddenly there is an attack on Bitcoin (a fork occurs, etc.), what happens to those coins -- do they sit safe in the LN address, or is it recommended for that reason to regularly settle the coins onto a BTC address? Is it possible for a LN address to send bitcoins to someone else's Bitcoin address (and route via LN), and vice versa? 
3. Can you detail efforts to make LN routing private, so that LN nodes aren't able to keep a record of user transactions? I've heard of encrypting transactions; perhaps, the onion routing model puts this into practice. But can you explain it, and describe what benefits (and vulnerabilities, if any) exist? Is there any threat of LN nodes spying? Can LN nodes track IP addresses, or identify origin/destination? What happens if a malicious actor controls many LN nodes: would this make spying easier (the way it works in Tor with bad actors controlling exit nodes)?
4. What kind of fee is expected, in order to be able to transact on the LN? Is it a static fee, or is it dynamic? Is it user-controllable? The LN summary document states: "Lightning enables one to send funds down to 0.00000001 bitcoin without custodial risk" -- this implies a user can send as little as 1 satoshi to another user, which confuses me because it would imply there is no fee (or is the fee less than 1 satoshi?).
5. How does a future transition to the LN affect Bitcoin miners compensation (specifically their compensation from 'miner fee', which will become a bigger concern as time goes on and coinbase reward decreases)? Any ideas on this issue, as it relates to LN or even generally speaking? From what I understand, variables that affect this situation are: 1) bitcoin's exchange rate (the higher the price, the more each miner fee and coinbase reward is worth), 2) volume of on-chain transactions (the more transactions, the more miner fees).
6. What does it mean that LN transactions are "atomic"? What benefits does this offer?
7. What are the system requirements to run a LN node? The graphic used in the summary document implies smartphones and laptops will be equally able to run a node. Is this true?
8. Is running a LN node incentivized? I seem to recall that users running a LN node will be paid a 'LN fee' for any transaction their node helps relay. Is there such a monetary incentive, or is there another incentive to participate as a LN node?
9. Assuming there *is* a monetary incentive, what are your thoughts and the team's thoughts on fixing the lack of incentive to run a Bitcoin full node, by introducing a clear financial incentive for LN nodes? I was thinking this could be done by integrating LN nodes with Bitcoin full nodes, thereby incentivizing Bitcoin full nodes and LN nodes via a LN fee. This would avoid a more messy approach to introduce a "Bitcoin node fee" (similar to "miner fee") to force every on-chain transaction to contribute a small fee that is paid out to Bitcoin full nodes. I am taking inspiration from r/JoinMarket, in this respect, as that project uses the incentive of a monetary benefit to successfully encourage people to lock bitcoins to allow people to CoinJoin with them. (LN seems like a similar situation of locking bitcoins to allow LN transactions to occur)
10. Has there been any thought given, as to short-term and long-term implications of requiring bitcoins to be locked to perform LN transactions? If a portion of the money supply is locked, what positive or negative effects would it have? How can the negative effects (if any) be resolved?
11. There is a focus on micropayments with LN, but it seems that with all the benefits offered by LN, many users will have the urge to perform larger transactions too. How does the user know the max amount of bitcoins able to be transacted over LN? What currently is anticipated as the maximum typical amount of bitcoins that can be transacted over LN? How can LN be designed to allow even larger transactions to be conducted, to make LN more flexible in that regard?
12. If there is an issue conducting a LN transaction (if a node is unresponsive or absconds from its duties), then what is the minimum, typical, and maximum amount of time the user's funds will be in limbo? Do funds simply return to the user's LN address? Does the user have any control over the process? Does the user get notified when an issue occurs? 
Well, it became a lot more questions than I planned, sorry. Thanks for taking the time to answer questions!

That's true actually though, that it depends on how often one has to settle transactions on-chain.

The idea is just so foreign that it's difficult to explain, difficult to understand, and difficult to rationalize and justify compared to the currency system. I don't expect people at WEF to necessarily be engaged enough with esoteric concepts like cryptocurrency to really understand its implications or potential.
Whether and when bitcoin starts to really pick up speed in adoption is impossible to tell. It could remain a niche currency for a long time (adoption increasing only very slowly), or, probably due to some failing government and its inflating fiat currency or bail-ins, bitcoin adoption could occur quickly and suddenly (to protect one's wealth). It seems to be occurring to some extent in Argentina and Venezuela: in Argentina because people are very tech-minded and educated and there is inflation so they choose bitcoin to protect wealth, and in Venezuela perhaps because electricity is subsidized and cheap (so bitcoin mining becomes a way to generate money) and inflation is deteriorating their wealth.
Supporting the Venezuela idea, bitcoin.org is ranked 2,197 in Venezuela ( which is the highest rank out of the top 5 countries that represent most demand for visiting bitcoin.org. This means Venezuela, per capita, may be one of the highest sources of bitcoin demand. The only reason I can imagine is: cheap electricity + the chaos in the country due to massive inflation.

I think each LN address is actually a bitcoin address.


With that in mind, you would use LN to: open a channel with me &amp; send 1.001 satoshis (if we assume LN tx fee = 0.001 satoshis) from your bitcoin address to my bitcoin address. Then, the process would repeat (me --&gt; Charlie --&gt; Dave). Between each of us (you-me, me-Charlie, Charlie-Dave) would be 20 hops (20 LN nodes processing the encrypted, hidden payment).
Dave would end up with 1 satoshi in his bitcoin address.

Yes, fungibility is absolutely essential. But, u/cryptolution, it's easier said than done. We have none of this right now in the protocol, so fungibility needs to actually first be standardized and implemented **by default**.
What everyone needs to understand is that VCs care about nothing more than profit. This is why they invest. Every single Bitcoin business is in it, primarily for the money (or they start off caring about vision, and ultimately become 'all about the money'). When push comes to shove, that is what matters to them. Their investors want returns, and will throw aside Bitcoin's vision, in exchange for returns on their investments. Either the community and development teams can and will, in a unified manner, reject and push back and begin public campaigns against such corruption when it emerges, to protect Bitcoin, or Bitcoin will inevitably be co-opted.
"Blockchain Alliance" can prove everyone wrong about their intentions, by publicly voicing support for (and supporting, via actions) bitcoin fungibility by default.
When I say "every single Bitcoin business", this is a figure of speech. Obviously we will have a proud few that really do believe in Satoshi's vision and wish to advance Bitcoin in a pure form, but I'm claiming the majority will sooner or later lose those pure intentions. This is especially true as companies continue to raise funds and dilute the owners' share in the company. When American Express invests, does American Express really care if pure Bitcoin is the result, or do they just want a return? Just an example. When BitFury expresses that they want to "drive criminals OFF", did they consider how they intend to do that? Is it by violating fungibility and unilaterally taking action as a miner to not process certain transactions? Are they aware that such a move is anathema to Bitcoin's permissionless and open nature? I don't know.

"Locked", meaning what?
Funds aren't locked, except for people acting as LN nodes (who are making up the actual "LN") who earn fees for relaying LN txs. It is those people who choose to "lock" funds on LN, to help LN users transact. But, LN "users" simply send and receive funds.
If Alice has somehow received 1 bitcoin via various LN txs from others, then she can send that 1 bitcoin on-chain to a normal bitcoin address whenever she likes (as long as pays the 10,000 satoshis miner fee). Alice has no need to "close links" (i.e. close channels between herself and other people).

These companies cannot legitimately force a migration, without causing a media scandal.

I acknowledge it may not be a good long-term situation, but in the short-term, the U.S. is managing the fallout of the '08-'09 crisis quite well, relative to the rest of the world. We've engaged in lots of QE, and yet inflation is persistently low here. Maybe in that future that will change, but for now, things have been managed well (obviously I support bitcoin more, though).
Also, wrt your chart, see this:


In the last 40 years, the USD index has essentially been flat. That's an example of what I was saying. Relative to other fiat, USD has been quiet stable. It has risen higher and fallen lower, but there has been regression to the mean.

Can you be more specific? I don't see much. It's not academic only; it's real and it's coming.


Except, LN can do this without having to bootstrap a brand new network. Bitcoin is worth $4.5 billion and has millions of users. There is no sense in using a new network, when an existing network is in place and has a solution in development (LN).


What flexibility tradeoffs? What severe deficits? Sounds like hyperbole.


u/statoshi mentioned that based on his observations, 12 months seems a good estimate.
Also, CLTV has already been merged, which allows rudimentary LN to function.
CSV is due to be merged in the next 3 months with Core 0.12. That will allow an even more functional LN.
Later, malleability needs to be addressed, to allow fully-featured LN that can serve large transactions of greater value. Malleability is a more difficult problem to solve though, and needs more time to marinate.


See below:


This is a true issue, and very complex to address. It's the **only real issue from the list, IMO**. It's not really an issue *yet*, though. We are still very much a decentralized system.
On the other hand, research is always ongoing on how to decentralize mining further. One idea I think could have potential is 21's efforts. Let's see what happens in the next 1 year.


Lightning addresses that.


See Moore's Law for CPU/storage aspects, and Nielsen's Law for bandwidth (as well as LN to off-load bandwidth reqs).


Don't know what this means exactly. I think 'hard fork' concept addresses it? That partitions effectively, but only with overwhelming consensus of the Bitcoin network, which is a feature not a bug.


How is this relevant? If Bitcoin devs determine that quantum is a problem, then Bitcoin will be upgraded to become resistant. Resistance comes with its own tradeoffs, so it's not something to undertake lightly.


Again, not sure what this means or why it's an issue. It's a design of the system. There are checks and balances (nodes vs. miners vs. exchanges &amp; processors vs. users vs. businesses vs. investors vs. developers) that help keep each side in balance.
BTW, this also relates to how to defend against the issue of mining centralization. Miners don't exist in isolation. They only benefit when the system as a whole gets more valuable. Their interests lie in making BTC more valuable, so they are expected to act mostly in their own self-interest. The other variables in the equation can also exert pressure on miners to keep them in line, and assure a stable system that is "decentralized enough". At the same time too, of course, research continues to figure out a way to naturally via technology create more decentralization.

Really nice feature. Although, Bitcoin is making its own moves in that direction too? See BIP 47 (reusable payment codes).


Pruning is really underestimated, though. If it can't prune, it can't scale. Currently Monero has 1 transaction every 3 min on average, vs. Bitcoin's 300 every 3 min. If it can't scale reliably in a decentralized manner, then isn't it 'broken' by default and a dead end?


Not reusing addresses is automated by HD wallets these days, like breadwallet, so I wouldn't say it's difficult. r/JoinMarket really simplifies the process of CJ and advances the idea in many ways (no waiting, instant CJ, very very low costs, automation of CJ, incentives to create a large pool of CJ liquidity, etc.). You should look it up. Their next step is to integrate with wallets, so as to make using JM extremely simple. The level of privacy possible is also high, if you consider doing CJ with 5 parties, then repeating with another 5 parties, and so on as many times as you like (all with random amounts, random time delays, etc.), and in an automated fashion with JM.
Imagine adding CT to this, and you improve privacy by a lot since all amounts would now be hidden.
And don't forget, both JM's CJ and CT are fully compatible with pruning.


ZC is fully zero knowledge, while Cryptonote is not zero knowledge (transaction amounts are visible). This makes ZC a lot better.


I believe this issue has been resolved, though I don't remember the link to more info on it.


I wouldn't judge ZC based on comments by one individual. There are a lot of people involved in creating ZC.

Well, it is the true solution to scaling, since it allows virtually unlimited transactions with only a 133 MB block size (according to draft white paper). Even if you expand that a little to 250 MB or 500 MB (to account for bigger transaction sizes, or to allow for extra room for the extra use cases you stated), it's still vastly smaller block size than a non-LN solution (needs 24 GB blocks to allow everyone 2 txs/day).
In terms of "locking BTC", those want to send and receive money don't do that. The LN node operators do that.

From recently published CoinParty paper:


@_date: 2015-10-12 18:14:42
Hey Mike, do you really need to publicly denounce Bitcoin with hyperbole ("extremely poor technical judgement")? You realize this kind of behavior is highly unprofessional and uncordial? You can voice your concerns discreetly (i.e. in a professional manner) on the dev side, and see what people say. If the consensus (majority based) is that mempool limiting patch is inferior to another solution, then that's the end of the story. What makes you think you know best, and that everyone else (u/jgarzik, and everyone else) is just stupid? How egotistical does one have to be, to think in such a manner? /rhetorical Q
The mempool limiting patch is worse, as I've said, because it is guaranteed to drop legit users' txs as well as spam txs. Sure, spam txs may be dropped 99x and legit txs 1x (or even let's say: 999:1 ratio), but how is that acceptable? A user paying a 'normal' fee needs predictability that his tx will go through. Having it randomly dropped (and without any notification to the user and no recourse on UI side to automatically re-send!) makes little sense, from a customer satisfaction standpoint (which you say you champion).
The other objection I have is that you have spinned this news very deceitfully. The increase in *minrelaytxfee* is NOT the only change (as your post has implied). It's a temporary hack, to reduce full nodes' RAM usage which is crashing nodes during the attack. As another user said, the real plan and the FULL story behind what is going on is as follows:

Eh, imo, killer app (that which takes us mainstream) is an extremely cheap (virtually free), yet extremely secure and easy to use, wallet. This mythical wallet will give new users enough trust and confidence in Bitcoin to use it. Otherwise, they'll remain scared and hence uninterested.
I think Ledger HW.1 is a step in that direction, since it's only $15. But it needs to be even cheaper (maybe down to $1, so all Bitcoin companies can start distributing them for free to their customers as a complimentary service), with the ability to be initialized securely built-in (so no need for separate purchase of Ledger's secure starter device).

With RootStock, it's no longer necessary for Ethereum to exist separately from Bitcoin.


I've investigated to some degree, and this doesn't hold up. Theoretically, it's great. Practically, it's at such an early stage of development (protocol, infrastructure, ecosystem) that it's highly risky to store value in for any extended period of time. The privacy generation is also uncertain for various reasons, biggest of which is non-mandatory mixin &gt;= 0 (75% of txs are mixin = 0, which means the advertised magical cryptonote anonymity is not there in practice).


Dunno about this one. Looks like it's maintained a decent peg, so far.


Yet, they're marketed as "revolutionary" and "bitcoin 2.0" -- and plenty of naive users fall for it.


Again, contradictory. Most will perish, yet they represent a healthy system? I understand why you're saying it's healthy, but it's not healthy from the perspective of all the hodlers of these super-super-super high-risk currencies, or blatant pump 'n dumps. Most of those hodlers will get badly burned.
So, to summarize, I think the advent of mature, true, stable trustless 2wp bitcoin sidechains could not come sooner. The advent of that will drastically reduce risk, by eliminating incentive to pump 'n dump (since sidechains have currency that is pegged to bitcoin value) and allowing altcoins with actual utility to be used natively with bitcoin, instead of as an altcoin, thereby reducing volatility, fragmentation, confusion, and bad reputation (prompted by high number of burned users).

It seems this guy was more disrupting things unnecessarily actually, since the attack was known and scheduled to be fixed in coming months, based on the network's progression since it has tradeoffs. I don't know if the guy knew of this, but his attack could probably have been told to the Core devs in private, instead of being launched on the mainnet and disrupting users. tl;dr -- this does not seem to have been an ethical or 'helpful' move.

Did you listen to what Tim Cook said?


He said Apple has designed iOS products in such a way that: "privacy and security is designed into the product". He also said: "encryption is a must in this world" and "any backdoor means a backdoor for bad guys as well as good guys, so a backdoor is a non-starter".
In practice, this is assured because all the data is encrypted by the user's passcode. Apple requires a passcode, and that passcode is used to encrypt all data, preventing Apple from holding any private key.
The user also has the option to disable data from being stored in iCloud. iOS 9 also defaults to needing a 6-digit passcode, instead of the previous 4-digit default (and the user is free to make the passcode even longer), for higher security.
FWIW, I follow various security experts on Twitter, and some of the most legitimate use iOS, albeit with various modifications (like removing the microphones, instead using headphones or bluetooth).

Ah, okay so we can have that debate. The only thing I wanted to point out was that "centralization / decentralization" is a really, really critical topic.

Maybe I misunderstood the implication of your statement, but I wanted to emphasize this.

Thanks for providing a post that gives reasons that are organized clearly.


BIP 102 is written and coded.
BIP 103 (by Wuille) is written and coded (apparently code is within the BIP?).
Then, there is also Back's 2-4-8/3-6-9 proposal, which may or may not be written up as a BIP or coded (but I don't imagine it's complicated to do so).
"BIP 103++" is being written and coded (Garzik said it would be ready by Dec. 6, in time for the conference - Scaling Bitcoin  in Hong Kong):
* 
* 
*  (I think this is "BIP 103++")
Flexcap proposal is being worked on by Friedenbach, possibly in time for the Dec. 6 conference.


As many like to say, "argument from authority". Also, Gavin is a paid Advisor to Coinbase (conflict of interest, u/bdarmstrong), and is also a paid member of MIT's Digital Currency Initiative (which is sponsored by various corporations, not by MIT).


As many like to say "ad hominem!" -- re: the derogatory term 'small blockers'.
Altcoins also have no market cap worth mentioning relative to Bitcoin, and nowhere near close the transactions demand experienced by Bitcoin. They also are not responsible for securing $5+ billion dollars of value, nor are being used by 13-15 million people (Wences' estimate).


KNC Miner said they no longer hold allegiance to BIP 101, but BIP 100 instead. Bitpay also said they are not stuck on BIP 101, but BIP 100 and others are fine too. Bitnet also said they are open to other proposals and have no loyalty to BIP 101.
Coinbase has recently reiterated support for BIP 101.
Actually, Brian Armstrong has said this (not Coinbase employees, in general), but he has provided zero technical justification or arguments that support why BIP 101 is better than other proposals. He has not discussed its pros and cons. Instead, he has ambiguously said it seems like the best. By implication, he has tried to bully the rest of the ecosystem into following his lead (since he has refused to provide actual analysis into why it's the best).
Brian (u/bdarmstrong) also, I believe, has not attended Scaling Bitcoin  nor will attend Scaling Bitcoin  which calls into question his dedication to *properly* figuring out how to scale Bitcoin. Why? I don't know.
Brian (u/bdarmstrong) has also touted that he created Toshi node that scales to 2.7 million Coinbase users, but lost in that is the point that the Toshi node is OFF-CHAIN &amp; CENTRALIZED, and has no relevance to a decentralized distributed cryptocurrency (which is what Bitcoin is).
Brian (u/bdarmstrong) also recently advocated industry switch to XT, yet provided, again, no analysis or comprehensive justification. BitFury, on the other hand, has released a white paper with research why XT is a far inferior option to Core. Comments, Brian? Where is your comparable math and computer science and data-backed research report for your recommendations?
A different Coinbase member, Charlie Lee, who has actual experience with decentralized cryptocurrency (being a founder of Litecoin) has strongly advocated against BIP 101, and against XT. Charlie also attended Scaling Bitcoin conference...
I wonder who has more credibility in the debate?


That's nice, but why no mention of impact on decentralization? Bitcoin is not meant to run as a centralized Toshi node server sitting in Coinbase. Bitcoin is a censorship-resistant, decentralized, cryptocurrency with thousands of nodes and globally distributed miners.
Please provide analysis of impact on this. BitFury has graciously done the math and analyzed many of the previous proposals, including BIP 101, here:
* 
Again, Brian Armstrong (u/bdarmstrong) of Coinbase, have you released a report that I'm not aware of that analyzes BIP 101 and shows it is superior? I'd love to see it. I'd also love to see commentary on BitFury's analysis.
Ditto for u/peoplma, and anyone else.


RAM is limiting factor for nodes, WHEN spam attacks are the issue. When talking about handling regular demand, then of course bandwidth (in terms of ISP data caps) is a bottleneck, since bandwidth improves slower than the other metrics.
Also, Core has recently released various improvements to help mitigate impact of spam attacks.
Larger blocks increase cost of attacks, yes, but let's keep in mind how to increase block size in a way that maintains a decentralized network, instead of a bastardized network owned and controlled by Brian Armstrong of Coinbase (via using Bitcoin XT solely controlled by Gavin, which Brian recently endorsed... again, without providing any proper detailed justification).


Maybe that's true. I don't know enough to comment.


The same SPV mining shortcut that recently led to problems with miners?


This argument completely ignores everything the community has talked about for the last year. We have ample evidence that the issue is not download/upload speed, but data caps... and aggregate bandwidth usage. It is common knowledge by now that even CURRENT block size of 1 MB means nodes have ~150 GB of bandwidth usage a month. This is very close to common data caps in North America of 200-300 GB.
You propose that 23 MB blocks "are still possible today for half the world". Really? If we extrapolate out, this means monthly bandwidth usage of 150 * 23 = 3,450 GB/month. Data caps don't even exceed 200-300 GB, on average... We have some rare fiber optic ISPs that offer caps of 3,000 GB, but: 1) it's limited, and 2) even there, using that much bandwidth leads users to be scolded by their ISP.


Details? Analysis of real world to show how this would work, and how viable or likely it is?


Bitcoin is not supposed to replace Visa. Bitcoin is a "purely peer to peer" technology, designed to provide electronic cash that is censorship-resistant. As Satoshi said, Bitcoin is meant to mimic Tor or Gnutella, and not be threatened by censorship.
Even if we consider the Visa argument, you say it will provide Visa capacity in 14 yrs. How is this relevant? In 14 years, things will be drastically different. Visa will accommodate orders of magnitude more. How does it make sense to compare Bitcoin in 14 yrs to Visa now?
BIP 101 is problematic because it assumes a constant exponential increase in bandwidth for 20 years of 41%/year. What if this is too little growth, if tech improves much faster? What if this is too much growth, if tech does not improve at this speed? --&gt; In the former, Bitcoin will be crippled. In the latter, Bitcoin will become centralized and the target of regulators, and thereby lose it's defining attributes.

Sticky is a great idea, but my point is threads like this sometimes come up spontaneously and attract lots of attention. That is the case with this thread. A fair perusal of what transpired here will reveal quality discussion, and minimal trolling or spamming. If it's "already been covered" -- well, sometimes things need to be repeated over and over and over again (I don't enjoy it, but I don't see any other option). The goal is for the most active community members to come to some agreement and common ground, and bridge the wide gulf that has developed in the community between Core vs. XT. At least, that's how I see it.
@_date: 2015-11-07 16:38:16


Left out, why? The original post claimed going from 1 MB to 23 MB is no big deal, but I'm saying that 1 MB requires ~150 GB/month of bandwidth on average, while 23 MB will require 23x that. In other words, it's a very big deal.
Yeah, it seems you edited the comment.


That was separate, yes. I mentioned Brian because I think it's highly irresponsible for the CEO of a major Bitcoin company to be making declarations about BIP 101, about XT, etc. without providing the requisite justification (and as I mentioned, BitFury has done just that in a highly technical document -- if BitFury is responsible enough to devote resources to understanding the situation properly, then I'd expect Coinbase to do the same, or at least to look at and critique BitFury's work!).
Brian is choosing to inject himself into a technical and political debate, but not responsibly doing so. I've even directly asked him numerous times to clarify his reasoning, yet he never responds to me nor to others. Other CEOs engage and give their reasoning, but Brian seems singularly uninterested in justifying himself. Ditto for not engaging with Scaling Bitcoin conference. He seems to live in his own world, with his own motivations.
That's fine, if Bitcoin was not an open-source collaborative effort. But it is collaborative in nature, and developers as well as miners have extremely clearly expressed their opposition to BIP 101, and especially to XT. Yet, Brian continues making inflammatory statements regarding both. Is it just me, or does that sound tone deaf?
I just don't understand what's going on behind the scenes, and yet, it's clearly a dangerous issue that needs to be resolved.
In case it's not clear yet, I'm not saying Brian should say "No more XT". I am saying he has a responsibility to justify himself, and clearly explain his reasoning behind coming to that decision. This includes addressing existing critiques, such as BitFury's critique about BIP 101 and XT. BitFury's main argument concerned negative effects on decentralization, btw. That is a legit argument, and it's what everyone else is saying too (in terms of developers &amp; miners). Brian needs to address that, explicitly.

I understand all this, and these are valid points. At the end of the day though, both sides have to accept that neither can get its own way, 100%. There *must* be compromise.
If one wants to help mitigate weaknesses of the compromise via other technology (like Lightning, to reduce ultimate block size needed), then that's fine, but I think compromise &amp; mitigation is all that can be realistically expected. The people on both sides who insist on advocating vast extremes frankly need to be overruled. Pragmatism is really important.

Then, block size will need to be increased, or Bitcoin otherwise scaled, to accommodate that real increase in demand.

Being "digital" is not what distinguishes cryptocurrency from fiat, though. As you said, they are both digital. The difference is that cryptocurrency is not an IOU, but an asset (like gold). Fiat is controlled by third parties and can be restricted; cryptocurrency cannot (as long as it's not stored with a 3rd party like Circle or Coinbase).
This is the whole point that made Satoshi's invention so special. Before this, digital things could be copied and replicated at will. Bitcoin is the first example of a digital asset that cannot be duplicated.
Btw, enjoy the crazy LTC pump, lol.

It's not just the theoretical idea that there is conflict of interest (anyone can argue that, and it would be a fair argument to debate, although I'd argue with clear conclusion that there is no real conflict of interest); it's the rest that I said in the post. There is a constant insinuation that Blockstream devs are acting in their own interest and don't care about Bitcoin (furthering narrative of 'stream blockers' and 'cripplecoiners'). You tell me how responsible or mature it is, to keep pushing that position.
As Garzik said:

I don't think I can agree. Mike gets plenty personal.
Have you seen how many times he repeats the idea that Blockstream has a conflict of interest, and not only theoretically... Mike has repeatedly said that Blockstream developers are only working in their own interest, and that their development on Bitcoin is focused on helping Blockstream maximize its profit.
These ideas have been discredited so many times. There has been no proof provided for such ideas. Yet, Mike repeats them. These seem very much like "personal" attacks.

He doesn't try to question it though. He simply "poo-poos" it away, and says it's "not realistic".

The problem is you're assuming there is one correct position for me to "stake out". I don't approach it this way. I'm not interested in staking out anything. I'm interested in 'exploring' and coming upon an answer.


I don't know what you mean. I'm not speaking with 'rhetorical techniques'.
Mike's words there were that "spam txs are paying a fee", as if that legitimizes spam txs. Obviously, it does not? On the surface, they're "paying a fee" but the fee rate is 18x lower than legit txs, so to say they're paying a fee just does not make sense. -- Thus, I responded saying that it feels disingenuous to make a statement like that (my assumption being Mike already knows the disparity in fee/size between the spam vs. legit txs), and that I cannot take him seriously and bother replying if he is going to be disingenuous.
We continued the conversation after that, and now it seems maybe he just overlooked the issue. I'll have to wait for his reply to see if that's the case, or if there is something else justifying his view.
Anyway, bottom line is that I'm not wedded to one side or another. I follow *a lot* of Bitcoin experts' views, and my view is based on their collective consensus views, albeit hopefully filtered with some logic. If I see some nonsense coming out of people on that side, then I very quickly make a point to mention it. I've done so with btcdrak and petertodd, on occasion.
My only motive or goal is to encourage *highly transparent and honest* discussion, in order to find answers. You've mentioned a lot about looking through my history; well I'd suggest you look through my submission history too, and see how what I submit is designed to inform and try to spread knowledge and ideas (so that the collective becomes better educated and can make better decisions -- for Bitcoin's sake). Putting this another way, my only allegiance is to Bitcoin... so I have no bias, and I hope everyone else can say the same. I don't get compensated by Core to say what I say. I only care to spend time or effort here as a hobby, to try to do my part to help Bitcoin.
But yeah, I'm not perfect. If I sometimes become less than perfectly calm, then I can't prevent that. I try to get back to an even keel quickly, though. The sooner the drama ends, the better.
@_date: 2015-10-16 21:16:13
I think it's also worth adding that the implicit alternative to the much maligned "fee market" or "fee pressure" is to increase the 21-million bitcoin limit. Either fees slowly get more expensive over time, or a fixed inflation rate (say, 1%) is instituted that causes bitcoin's supply to slowly increase.
The alternative is bitcoin's exchange rate increases enough to make up for declining miner fees, but I'm not really sure we can design the system with such an assumption in mind?
And, to be clear, if none of these things happen? Then, small miners will turn off and only the biggest will be left. Aka, like Charlie said, we'll have even worse mining centralization. Instead of 6 entities controlling 75% (which is already not ideal -- ideally we'd have hundreds or thousands or more, like Satoshi imagined with CPU mining), that number will just drop further.

Not turning into Visa does not mean only being used by a couple thousand people. You're looking at two extremes, and saying Bitcoin can only be one of them. That's a false choice.
Regardless, your idea that the system I'm advocating won't get any users is proven wrong by the current state of Bitcoin. The argument of a "couple thousand nerds" doesn't make sense, since Bitcoin has at least a million users, if not more. Coinbase cites 2.6 million users, Blockchain.info cites 4.5 million users, and then you can include all the other companies and wallet providers.

He wanted a "gentleman's agreement" not to switch from CPU to GPU miners, and did not seem to anticipate the vast mining centralization that has occurred, and resulting lack of full node incentive (since I think full nodes were originally tied to miners). Still, yes, it's obvious Satoshi was very lucid and a great thinker (e.g. his insight into exploiting small and medium botnets to help defend the Bitcoin network against larger botnets, and yet not get distracted by the morality of botnet mining, was amazing). He was quite pragmatic, also shown by his humility in respecting the power of governments and being tactful in his approach.
Anyway in terms of BitFury, can you speculate on their plans? Why would they say they want to invest $100 million into a new mining farm in Georgia? On top of that, they event hint at the imminent advent of 'exascale' Bitcoin hashrate, i.e. implying that hashrate will soon be above 1,000 PH due to their actions. Isn't that worrying? What could they be planning, that would keep mining hashrate distribution as decentralized as possible (and yet still lead to doubling Bitcoin's hashrate)?

**Fedcoin — how banks can survive blockchains**




a statistical error. Those accounts function as safe stores of liquidity for savers, guaranteed by the Bank of England. But if that is the simple answer surely it would be easier for everyone to have a current account with their central bank.




The combination of deposit-taking and credit- creation functions means even a simple bank, therefore, is operating two fundamentally different businesses. While those functions are interlinked today, it is what James Tobin termed, “essentially an accident of history.”

The fee paid by the spam txs are ~1 satoshi/byte. That's like paying 225 satoshis for a 225 byte transaction, which is 18.7x lower than what breadwallet defaults to (and breadwallet already is designed to charge the lowest fee possible for a decent confirm time!). This is why I think the move to increase the min fee/size paid by txs by 5x (to 1,125 satoshis for a 225 byte tx) is a good move, as it wouldn't impact normal users.

@_date: 2015-10-29 16:59:35


**Faster** -- Not true. Litecoin and Bitcoin are equally fast (to send a transaction), but it is confirmation time that differs. It takes 10 min for 1 confirmation on Bitcoin, and 2.5 min for 1 confirmation on Litecoin. The value of the two confirmations is not equal though. 1 confirmation on Bitcoin equals a lot more security (due to taking 10 min) than 1 confirmation on Litecoin.
**Secure** -- Not true. This is determined by a lot of things, but basically by network hashrate. Bitcoin's mining hashrate is literally about 300,000x higher than Litecoin's hashrate.
**Block size issue** -- Not true. Litecoin mines blocks 4x more frequently, so it has theoretically 4x higher capacity. But like I mentioned, this translates to lower security. Fundamentally, they have the same capacity. To change it, just requires a block size increase though, so it's not an "issue". Bitcoin is taking a long time over it, since devs want to make sure to do it "right" rather than doing it "fast" (to make sure nodes and mining are not affected negatively too much). There is also Lightning and other ideas floating around.
**Liquidity** -- True. It's quite a liquid coin, relative to other coins. On the other hand, Bitcoin has about 30x higher liquidity, 54 million USD vs. 1.8 million USD. So, why should one care about Litecoin's liquidity? How does it practically matter? There is a 30x higher liquidity option.
**Volatility** -- I will point out though that Litecoin typically seems to have higher volatility than Bitcoin (at least it used to, before its volatility just died recently). So, it can be traded and speculated with for higher returns. Still, this seems contrived and "too good to be true", so I can't imagine it will continue.
**LTC is "silver"** -- This is probably the most common reason used to justify LTC's existence. I don't understand it, since Bitcoin can be subdivided to 8 decimal places. Bitcoin is never going to be "too expensive to buy for the poor person", the same way gold is. Thus, the reasoning of silver/gold (LTC/BTC) has never made sense, yet it seems to keep being said. Who knows.
P.S. Regarding Ethereum, I agree with your statements. You can see my other comment in this thread.

If fees are less than 1 satoshi, then is it realistic to truly make enough money by providing liquidity, such that it counts as an incentive?
In terms of "access to an instant payment network", doesn't a casual LN user also have access? What is different with being a LN node?




I'm basically asking because I think it's inevitable that users demand to be able to use LN for all transactions, if in fact LN offers all the advertised benefits. I mean, I don't see any downsides to using LN. Why wait 60 min, if I can wait 1 second or a few seconds? It's also more convenient and seamless if users can just stick to dealing with LN address-based wallets, instead of having to move back and forth with BTC address wallets. So, if possible, I think LN should be designed to try to handle all transactions.


That sounds crazy (good). I didn't even know it's possible to go below a satoshi.
I wonder if 21 plans to make their system work by operating on LN (wink wink)?
What do you mean "just not trustless settling below that amount"?
I'm also confused when you say "no one really knows what the fees will actually be" -- so this means maybe it won't be &lt; 1 satoshi?
@_date: 2015-10-04 14:40:03
I would love to agree with you, but the most straightforward interpretation is not this. Sidechains were mentioned for scaling by a very tiny number of people, but it was also always quickly shot down as a solution. So, even if he was referring to how sidechains aren't a solution, he made no effort to differentiate about Lightning. In fact, the 'other side' sees Lightning and such efforts as a major part of the solution, so for him to dismiss it so quickly and hand-wave it away is quite arrogant. He seems to think he's the only one who can make a judgement on the matter, and that everyone else's opinion does not matter.

No, I actually do though. The optimal outcome of this drama is that everyone returns to the same page after finding the optimal solution, unhindered by ego. I disagree with Mike's view on some things, but I really would like his perspective to remain with Bitcoin. He explicitly talks about 'user experience', which some forget about and assume all users are just nerds willing to tinker endlessly. There's other things too, but that's a summary.
So, if I can take him seriously and not think what he is saying is 'disingenuous', then it's easier for me to engage. If I can't engage because I'm seeing things said that I feel are not reflective of reality, that will of course make me upset. And that means we're back to the situation of picking battle lines and ignoring or insulting one another.

Let me get this clear.
On the one hand, you spend your post talking about the Gavin/CIA situation and how people are "smearing" his name with it, even though OP only wrote 1 line in his post about Gavin.
On the other hand, you happily smear Greg's name (bearish? doesn't work? -- yeah that's why he co-founded a Bitcoin company, and has developed pretty much ALL of Bitcoin's privacy technology? CoinJoin, CoinSwap, Confidential Transactions, etc.)?? Hypocrisy much, and double standards? That's the first point.
Second point. You seem to not be aware of what Gavin said 1-2 days ago, regarding his involvement in Blockchain Alliance (you didn't even acknowledge it, why?). He gave what seemed to be a disingenuous argument that all those who oppose it are fans of "honey badger meme" and "don't care about CryptoLocker"... while ignoring the elephant in the room that Blockchain Alliance will decide unilaterally what is classified as "criminal", and that there are no privacy or security protections clearly defined for BA's interactions with DHS, DoJ, FBI, etc.
See BitFuryGeorge's tweet (he is Vice Chairman of BitFury, the biggest Bitcoin miner that recently invested $100 million to grow even bigger) for more color on this "criminal" aspect:


Then, the question becomes: how do they intend to do anything about it (i.e. "drive criminals OFF our neighborhood")? Bitcoin was designed as an open, censorship-resistant network that can be used by anyone anywhere, even under totalitarian governments and the police states of the world. "Driving" anyone out would appear to violate its whole design, and the principle of fungibility.

That's looking at fees on an absolute sense. In terms of fee/byte, which is how miners prioritize transactions at a simple level, it's 30x less than average (~1 satoshi/byte vs. 30 satoshis/byte).

Your arguments either aren't very strong, or I don't understand them. It seems the sidechain version of things will be cheaper (zero cost actually for Bitcoin users), and more decentralized (no need to use an exchange to convert BTC to XCP).
As for security, how is counterparty secured? Need that info before you can compare.
It's also not an argument that sidechains do not exist yet. Projects must be future thinking. As it is, rootstock will be using  federated 2wp sidechains, which do exist or will exist very soon. Later once ready, they will transition to the fully trustless 2wp.
Counterparty could try to compete in ease of use maybe? On that note, have contracts already been created? Are they in use? Why hasn't this sub heard anything more about the counterparty implementation since the launch a while ago?

If it's just a vehicle for pump n' dumps, or at best a high-beta clone, then I would have expected the relationship to break down at some point. Instead, it chugs along for years on end with its *relative* value more or less pegged to bitcoin's, despite no actual relationship /peg between the two. That implies the market sees something more than just a speculation vehicle... yet imo its fundamentals offer nothing worthwhile to justify that.
Its mining hashrate is also 300,000x less than bitcoin's, an absurd figure. Why hasn't it been attacked yet? It's worth $130 million in aggregate, so I'd imagine the incentive for an attacker exists.

Only a subset (randomly) of users was affected, yes, but so were users of other SPV clients, not just breadwallet. It was not a fatal flaw, though? No funds were ever at risk. It was fixed by deleting and reinstalling the app, or turning on airplane mode to force breadwallet to find new nodes to connect to. And in the latest update, breadwallet no longer is susceptible to that attack, as it blacklists the tarpitting nodes and automatically connects to new nodes if a node exhibits 'misbehaving' behavior.
One improvement breadwallet could still make is to integrate Tor/VPN to preserve users' privacy, since users' IP address is displayed when connecting to nodes.

The point stands, however, that censoring a narrow topic like 'XT' (not BIP101 or increasing block size!) is in no way as horrible as what everyone makes it out to be. People cry 'r/bitcoin is censored!', yet it really isn't generalizable like that, if one is interested in honesty.

I paged the mod because, believe it or not, the mods are actually extremely lenient these days. Your behavior in this thread (when I saw it originally, before your numerous "revisions" and "edits") was atrocious. You were even called out on it by OP. You're intentionally trying to speak in a very polite, yet passive-aggressive insinuating manner. -- Anyway, I think I've made my point in this regard.


"Ultimate influence"? What does that mean, and on what basis do you justify it?
Further, given Greg's contributions and expertise (CoinJoin, CoinSwap, Confidential Transactions, doing a majority of Bitcoin's code review and security review, among other things...), why shouldn't Greg hypothetically have greater influence than someone else? I think a merit-based hierarchy is quite legitimate. Greg is very highly respected in Bitcoin, and a lot of people seek his review for technical proposals and research studies on mining &amp; cryptographic proposals for privacy.
Meanwhile, people like Gavin (although recently he finally looked into it, and gave it credit) and Mike can't even wrap their heads around, or appreciate, a single proposal like Lightning! This last statement was a barb, but it's the truth of the matter and what makes the situation sad. Gavin ignored Lightning and did not care to understand it for months on end. It's one thing to disagree, but it's quite another to be anti-intellectual enough that you don't look at the basis (i.e. Lightning) of others' arguments, in order to be able to determine the merits or demerits.

Have you discussed with JM's creator, Chris Belcher? He is very active and helpful with answering questions and pointing to documentation.

Can you give an overview of the other proposals? I wasn't aware of any other implementations, so I'm curious.


The Tor is great, but Shapeshift does not only log IP, but also addresses. In other words, you send 3.21 bitcoins in and get 'x' alt-coin out, and those addresses and relationships will all be recorded. The other concern of course is the high fee (2-4%). In comparison, JM only costs between ~0.001-0.01% (200-4000x cheaper).

Yeah, but that's the point of decentralization. This is why people like Greg &amp; Adam are obsessed with it. The more decentralized and globally distributed Bitcoin nodes and mining, the less likely regulators are to be able to have any impact. With 5,000 nodes all over the world and mining worth hundreds of millions of $ of custom equipment, Bitcoin is currently quite resistant. Same thing with Lightning nodes. The idea is for them to be just like Bitcoin nodes, and as widely distributed as possible. If that's the case, then regulators can't do anything (just like they currently can't really do anything with Bitcoin).

1. Is there a reason you have chosen to ignore and not reply to Elizabeth Stark's (u/starkbot) post here?


2. Also, why ignore u/NaturalBornHodler's post here, which cited proof from literally 1 year earlier that Satoshi used the term 'SPV' quite explicitly?


3. Another concern: Why are you going to the media with deceptive statements, like the following?


No one has consistently made the argument that sidechains are a scaling mechanism (sidechains are argued to be an extension mechanism), and almost everyone has agreed that sidechains are actually very experimental, which is why Blockstream was funded $21 million almost exclusively to do the hard work required to bring them to fruition.
With Lighting, on the other hand, there is almost universal agreement that it can work, and plenty of people are working on it right now. So, why conflate Lightning and Sidechains in the same sentence as both being scaling solutions?
Making up facts and selectively responding to posts is not a sign of honesty or sincerity (not that you're the first person to do this, but these are especially serious topics).

It does accept a transaction that small, when transacting over LN.
I'm guessing the argument is something like this: It's not possible to spend 1 satoshi over the on-chain bitcoin network anyway, so there is no logical reason for someone to want to settle it on-chain. When the balance has reached a meaningful amount (something worth settling on-chain, after paying the regular bitcoin transaction fee of ~10,000 satoshis), then of course the user can 'settle' on-chain and use it for non-LN transactions. But for all intents and purposes, the balance of 1 satoshi in the LN bitcoin address is perfectly usable, and the user has full control and ownership of that balance. Therefore, there is no need for "settlement" in the first place. At such a small amount of bitcoins, they can be used only via LN anyway since on-chain bitcoin would consider them 'dust'.

It sounds like an impossible task to reasonably 'perfect' the protocol, but if it's possible, this would be amazing. I've imagined the same, that a superior Bitcoin would be one that prevented any changes being made to [co-opt] the protocol.
Is it really reasonable to expect to get it to a level of reasonable perfection (such that no bugs would be found, nothing would need to be added or removed?)?
It is really possible to 'freeze' the core protocol (and rely on outside layers to change things in an optional manner)?

Okay, but I don't think it makes sense that, just because a certain band of 'extremists' feels a certain way about block size &amp; Gavin, that it makes sense to associate their position on block size with everyone else who feels similarly about block size. What I mean is, there are plenty of people (most people) who think block size should be increased with care... and those people do not share all of Mircea's views. Mircea is right in that security will decrease by increasing size in a wonton manner. Plenty agree on that aspect. But, most don't agree with Mircea's other views ("poor people shouldn't use bitcoin").
In any event, LN has nothing to do with this. LN will allow "poor people" to use Bitcoin rather, since the fee with LN is so miniscule (less than 1 satoshi).

On this note, do you know if theoretically there is a way to make it more secure for a node operator to lock funds, i.e. through use of multisig (maybe with smartphone / hardware wallet like ledger nano acting as the second key)? We know how vulnerable to malware desktop OSes are, so I'm wondering how to improve security if btc must be locked in such an environment. I think Electrum has multisig and compatibility with using hardware wallets as a key.
Or does the locking process itself mitigate this issue? Do you know what is involved in that? Any similarities with locking for side chains?
The solution to this problem can then similarly hopefully apply to securing a variety of situations, including locking funds for r/joinmarket... and even it could apply to the Core wallet?

It doesn't..? The 500 satoshis would have to be sent via LN (which is off-chain, not on-chain) to Alice.
I think the issue here is you're imagining that every single LN transaction between different parties will require a new LN address to be generated... and that each LN address will thus accumulate tiny quantities of bitcoin, which cannot be sent on-chain and are hence locked on LN. Correct?
I think the way it works is the LN address is static, so the only new thing generated is a payment channel between me-Alice &amp; you-Alice. Alice uses the same static LN address in all cases, receiving all LN payments to that address. The payments won't be sitting in different LN addresses that Alice owns.
Or, the way it works would be akin to a hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet, where a new LN address is generated for each transaction but all payments still end up being controlled by the same "account" (i.e. the same LN HD wallet).
If I had to guess though, I'd guess it's a static LN address per user, with new payment channels being created in order to link users together. The payment channels between users don't cost anything to open or close; the only fee is LN tx fees (which cost less than 1 satoshi). The thing that costs 'real' money (a Bitcoin miner's fee - ~10,000 satoshis) is opening that special LN channel address (represented on the bitcoin block chain as a new on-chain transaction).

It grows linearly between two points, but overall block size grows exponentially... 8-16-32-64-etc. The exponential nature of the increases is what I'm referring to. It assumes bandwidth will increase on average of 41% per year.
This is also the reason I don't like the proposal. Cisco's specific end-user-based broadband growth estimates for 2015-2020 are 17% growth/year over that time period. 41% = 141% faster than the 17% estimate.
The other reason I don't like BIP 101 is because it takes the liberty of estimating constant exponential bandwidth growth going 20 years into the future. If it was estimating 5 years, that might be more tolerable, but 20 years is way too excessive. Real bandwidth growth could be hugely under or over, but we'd be locked into increasing at 41% year regardless. Just not a wise proposal.

**Question:** What actual demand for bitcoins is generated by the 'Fidelity effect'? That is the only question that matters. If it's 1 bitcoin worth (split into 100 million satoshis), then that is worthless as far as price is concerned. Are they intending to buy a meaningful number of bitcoins (to increase 'demand' side of demand vs. supply)?
I say this because there is a trend where certain individuals and companies note Bitcoin as a 'payment rail' and not as a store of value. In other words, people think value is in converting fiat to BTC, but then quickly converting from BTC back to fiat. If Bitcoin is used in this manner, I see the exchange rate of bitcoin being minimally impacted -- i.e. the "Fidelity Effect" may not in bitcoin holders' interests.

As far as I know, this is false. Anyone in the world will be able to run their own Lightning node. What determines who can run a node is how much money they are willing to "lock" to the node. The more money locked, the more in fees you can potentially earn. Fees, by the way, are less than 1 satoshi worth. In other words, Blockstream will have no special reason in particular to be running a LN node, and no special ability to profit more by running a node than any other entity.

They are paying ~1 satoshi/byte. It's disingenuous to say they "do pay fees, if you hadn't already noticed", when 1 satoshi/byte is not any realistic sort of fee. Non-spam transactions pay 30x more than that, on average (30 satoshis/byte).

Otherwise, the obvious conclusion is you're "opportunistically jumping into this thread to spread XT via direct misinformation ("spam txs are also paying fees" -- implication: they're perfectly legitimate), and indirect misinformation via 'lying by omission' (i.e. without presenting both sides of the argument behind XT's differences -- since there are of course two sides to every decision, and everything has a tradeoff)".

It may seem like it lacks empathy, but it is reality. Bitcoin is a decentralized system with more acute tradeoffs than centralized systems. In exchange for censorship-resistant payments that can be sent to anyone in the world, along with zero capital controls, you get trade-offs of this nature.
When something like Lightning Network is fully in place, then Bitcoin will theoretically blow centralized payment systems out of the water. Until then, Bitcoin has certain weaknesses (micropayments) and it's better to accept that reality, instead of endlessly complaining about it (which is unproductive and pointless).
Btw, my response didn't totally lack empathy. If someone wants to send micropayments, ChangeTip does work and is perfect for that. It requires trust of ChangeTip, but trust is also required of any other centralized fiat payment systems you mention.

I explained in the first post:


@_date: 2015-10-16 20:56:03
I said "I'll leave it at that", but I rescind my statement, lol. I think it's more helpful to say the following...
I really think Adam Back's 2-4-8 proposal (or a variant -- I think Adam has said even 3-6-9 is okay, as far as numbers go --- or IMO something granular like 2-3-4-6-8) over a 4.5 year timescale (2016 - 2, 2018 - 4, 2020 - 8) is one of the best ideas.
It confines us to 4-5 years of predictions, instead of 20 years in BIP 101. This is good because it's very difficult to predict 20 years ahead. We may undershoot or overshoot. It's also good in terms of measuring effects on the network's decentralization metrics. It's finally also good because most protocol development will happen earlier on, i.e. next 5 years, not later 15 years. It is during the time of most development (including things like LN) that block size should be carefully raised, and effects and interactions evaluated.
Based on Tradeblock's analysis of expected transaction capacities, a 2-4-8, or 2-3-4-6-8, or 3-6-9, or 3-5-6,7,9 proposal would be sufficient. I haven't modeled these proposals over their analysis though, so for specifics that might be a good idea.
Anyway, do you know if Brian is aware of this variant of proposal? If not, please do make him aware, so he can consider it.
I thought Greg and Gavin and others were constructing some sort of 'compromise' proposal following Scaling Bitcoin 1, too, although I haven't heard anything since.

With ChangeTip, if 10,000 people also send you 1 satoshi, you can "cash out" on-chain the 1 satoshi tip. -- correct
With LN, it's the exact same situation as ChangeTip. If you receive 10,000 satoshis to your LN bitcoin address, then you can send on-chain instead of via LN to a normal bitcoin address -- 10,000 satoshis will get consumed as miner fee, and 1 satoshi will end up in that address.
I don't understand what you mean by: "unless it's rolled back to yourself even if someone else sends you 10000"


Again, I don't see how this is different from ChangeTip. The 1 satoshi I just tipped you on ChangeTip will be stuck permanently in your ChangeTip (a TTP) account, unless you receive enough funds to meet ChangeTip's minimum withdrawal rule (akin to paying a miner fee in the trustless LN to send the money on-chain to a normal bitcoin address).
At the same time, on LN, it's not "locked" and unusable until you receive 10,000 satoshis more. You can send that 1 satoshi to someone else! Ditto with ChangeTip. Now that I sent you 1 satoshi, you can use ChangeTip to send that 1 satoshi to someone else.
@_date: 2015-10-02 22:57:18
If the "main" chain (by which I mean on-chain txs) offers really low fees, that means there is excess block supply relative to demand for transactions. If that's the case, then it means either no one is using Bitcoin or block size is much larger then demand. If we assume people *are* using Bitcoin, then the only option to consider is if block size is much larger than demand. If block size is much larger than demand, then it means it's much larger than 1MB.
If that's the case, then it means all requirements to run a node (disk storage, bandwidth, RAM and CPU, etc.) will increase. BitFury's report showed very clearly (and it's common sense, don't really need their report) that as node requirements rise, number of nodes in operation will fall. This is just a logical relationship.
If nodes fall, then decentralization (determined by # &amp; distribution of full nodes, and # &amp; distribution of mining hashrate) decreases.


Show me? I don't know how it's possible for everything to point to the contrary, as I've illustrated above. Logically, it just doesn't make sense.

In terms of Satoshi's original vision, if you don't think current trajectory is what you "signed up for" (i.e. if you want to take an emotional look at the situation, and ignore what most of Bitcoin's experts say), then you're free to sell your bitcoins.
Responding to your argument based on assuming you're speaking from a rational (non-emotional) point of view, I still disagree. Satoshi's vision is 5 years old. In that time, the entire ecosystem has changed dramatically. Satoshi wanted censorship-resistant, peer-to-peer money, which is not possible if you have massive centralization like we do today (nodes have been decreasing consistently, and mining hashrate is very centralized) -- centralization means it becomes vulnerable to regulation and AML/KYC and hence no longer strictly peer-to-peer as Satoshi wanted -- and aggressively increasing block size will only serve to increase that centralization.

There *are* hundreds, and the free market *is* deciding their value. When I speak about RootStock, I'm comparing it to Ethereum. They are both early in development, but the differentiator is RootStock uses bitcoin as currency while Ethereum uses ether as currency. I mentioned RootStock to indicate that the rationale for altcoins to exist becomes lost as bitcoin-based sidechains emerge. Monero is a different argument since they may claim super privacy, but what is available *today* does not actually provide that.

Literally, nobody of import has EVER said block size does not need to be increased if LN is adopted. Ever.

The draft white paper itself says numerous times that LN is not a substitute for raising block size, just simply that block size does not need to be raised nearly as much with LN vs. without LN.

Who said he can't speak? My point is that he is toxic, through his actions and words. I will repeat: if every other developer was like him, then Bitcoin would not exist. Instead of "Bitcoin", it would be Bitcoin X, Bitcoin Y, Bitcoin Z, etc. etc. -- i.e. we would have 10 different Bitcoins (separate market caps, basically altcoins), each with their own couple developers. What you are justifying is a situation of anarchy where there is no cohesion, and no main project moving forward and gaining critical mass. All I can say is thank goodness most Bitcoin developers have some sense in terms of "working together" and controlling their egos.

These are Reddit's rules, to try to prevent vote manipulation. Obviously no system is perfect, but personally I appreciate their effort to try to make it more difficult for vote manipulation to occur.
By the way, u/IamAlso_u_grahvity, we have had issues in r/bitcoin where users from r/bitcoinxt have essentially done exactly what you describe (link posts to bitcoin from bitcoinxt, and then users obviously have followed the link and voted or downvoted, en masse). When mods from r/bitcoin have responded with temporary bans, the users from r/bitcoinxt have an uproar about it and spread FUD about r/bitcoin mods.
I don't know how you guys decipher the data, but can you please investigate and make sure the two subs are very, very clear on the rules? When I've tried to mention these rules, they are mostly unhappy to hear it. Some are sympathetic and listen, but many ignored it and downvoted my posts that mentioned this (criticizing it as 'ridiculous' as the previous poster did, instead of seeing the larger purpose behind it -- clearly due to bias). People in the sub unfortunately seem to feel they are above following rules and don't need to follow rules (anarchist mentality).
If you could clarify these rules for the two subs, I think it would have a lot more impact. As it is, there is blatant vote manipulation at times and it really interrupts the discussion. The most recent example was this thread, where users from XT sub were upvoted very highly, but users from this sub were downvoted (it started with a user from XT linking this submission from XT):

Can you clarify "after seeing what cryptonote can do for privacy"?
Why not CJ+CT? CT would hide transaction amounts, so wouldn't that lead to perfect CJs? Zerocash's video presentation included CJ in its table comparison too, and gave it a relatively favorable review; i.e. its weaknesses would seem to be compensated by CT and JM.

Thanks for your response. I do appreciate the perspective of people like you, since it's a lot more down-to-Earth and reality-based than some others. I enthusiastically look forward to continuing this debate with you.


Are you saying only Dee Hock has 'real leverage'? Why?
Why would you say the others do not? All are some mixture of: successful entrepreneurs, fabulously wealthy (billionaire-level), well-connected with other rich and successful and connected individuals + companies in Silicon Valley, and influential (millions of followers on social media, huge press attention).
For instance, I'll reiterate my point:


Did you notice Balaji of 21 mentioned that they have everything in terms of relationships and connections with industry to mass produce and integrate their special chips, on the scale of millions with companies like Cisco and Broadcom? This is real power.
These people also have tight connections with Uber and Airbnb, and advise those companies too how to move forward despite obstacles. They have experience, in other words, with finding &amp; advancing disruptive technologies. Marc Andreessen developed the first internet browser, Netscape, and lived through that era when internet was first popularized.


That is easier said than done, no? They can "spend a few dollars" -- great. What about these guys I mentioned? Did you forget how wealthy and well-connected they are? Money speaks in the U.S., as does mass popular support and activism. Silicon Valley can match Wall Street these days, and even exceed it. JPM market cap is $250 billion. The tech industry? Vastly higher. I advise you familiarize yourself with:


This is why companies like Apple openly take on DoJ and FBI, as regards privacy and encryption. These companies are incredibly wealthy and have huge profit margins. They aren't threatened by government agencies.
Also defending Bitcoin, btw, are all the major tech lobby/activist groups, like FFTF and EFF. You can bet such groups will also raise havoc, if JPM ever tried to influence government to act.


Luckily, Bitcoin is still quite an ideological topic. It goes to the heart of money, private vs. public, human rights, free market, and freedom. These people, and people in Bitcoin in general, all are quite aware of the arguments for Bitcoin that go beyond "let's make profit". Thus, I can estimate great resistance to letting the issue slide, and great amount of enthusiasm for defending it.


I think I disagree. Even if JPM is successful (which I think there is very little chance of, at this point), Bitcoin can then go underground and focus enthusiastically on serving the black market. That is what happens when things get banned and declared illegal. The natural reaction is for Bitcoin to quickly adopt maximum decentralization technical measures (to make it more sybil resistant, and allow more convenient and easy to use p2p fiat/BTC trading) &amp; maximum anonymity (to make it untraceable, and thus hide its participants).
There is also a vast black/grey market for it to tap. Trillions of USD worth are in that economy. Don't forget that a vicious fight between Government vs. Bitcoin will only draw in massive media attention. Banning something leads to Streisand Effect. --&gt; This means the public will be educated, including the black/grey market population, and awareness of Bitcoin will skyrocket.
In other words, redux of failed drug war and alcohol prohibition.


I do agree. But, I've now explained some reasons why the argument is not only limited to that.
I want to emphasize this piece:

I wasn't accusing you of it. Sorry for my terse response to you, but I saw Brian's quote, and have become very frustrated. I don't know if the problem is Core, i.e. if Core really is stonewalling everything, or if the problem is Brian has ulterior motives that are satisfied by centralizing Bitcoin development into an implementation led by Gavin, or if the real story is something else entirely. Either way, the only thing that can solve this frustration is to get real answers from Brian, or someone else who knows something. I'm not in the mood to debate. It seems we're not the ones who make any actual decisions, and the real debate seems to be happening elsewhere.

Okay, but you realize that's how it's going to be, no matter what, right? It is impossible for that to change with Bitcoin. Well, maybe not. The best you could hope for is that Lightning Network is successful, since the fee with that drops to the level of single satoshis.

There's no "pretending" going on about securing funds. It's just not hard anymore with the technology and products available. We have vetted specialized hardware wallets, and they're not even that expensive (Ledger Nano is $33, Ledger HW.1 is $16 -- both are equivalent in security, only differing in durability of materials used in construction - metal vs. plastic), as well as software-based tech like PIN, and multisig so that multiple sources of info are required before funds can be spent (like requiring a smartphone app as a '2fa').
If the other party does not deliver, after a certain lock time, the funds return to the user. Funds are never lost.

Brian, are you serious about this?


You realize that most of Bitcoin's developers work on Core, and support Core, right? You realize that this kind of, what is essentially mutiny, risks creating a civil war in Bitcoin, and crashing the price as a result, as well as halting future development of the Bitcoin protocol? Speaking frankly, have you gone out of your mind, or have you sold out? I can't even imagine what would possess you to say these words. XT has almost zero adoption, since it was announced, while Core has retained almost all support by developers and miners. And what about Scaling Bitcoin conference  that has ended, and  that is coming up in a matter of days? Everyone in Bitcoin is hard at work trying to figure out the best solution.
**disclaimer:** I don't mean to make any assumptions or speak for anyone else with my post. I basically just want to know exactly what communication has occurred between you, Brian, and between members of Core, and what has caused you to say what you said.
@_date: 2015-10-21 23:40:27
Thanks :). The reason for the animosity is that Apple initially blocked bitcoin wallets, so people likely have an emotional reaction against Apple. Plus, Android is a more 'open' device that lets the user change and customize the OS, so some like that. Unfortunately, they forget to care about security, which is paramount when it comes to bitcoin and supersedes all else.
@_date: 2015-10-22 18:59:01
Yes (although you could counter-argue that Hearn was only "floating" the idea, and doing so in a transparent manner), and now we have this brand new effort where Gavin is one of the only (or THE only?) Bitcoin developers to be part of it. I mean, seriously, alarm bells?
I guess what I mean to say is, let's judge based on "actions", not on words, and not on ideas and possibilities.
I'm really disappointed to see what seems to be a trend, where Gavin "talked to the CIA right before Satoshi left", and now is part of a consortium talking to FBI, DoJ, Homeland Security, etc. -- still in this case, there is no evidence of Gavin advocating any controversial ideas (like redlisting), so he deserves to be given some benefit of the doubt.

Scaling Bitcoin via a 2MB hard-fork requires at least 6-12 months to do so safely, and probably at the later end of that range. For SegWit to be implemented by wallets requires much less time; most wallets are already working on it.
In addition, as soon as one wallet's users are using SegWit, everyone else will also benefit by having more capacity opened up. It's an incremental process.

My basic point is this: We can achieve end goals with higher chance of success by behaving intelligently, and with tact. Different means may lead to the same end. Lack of cooperation and open antagonism is a great way to provoke the other side. Discussion is a way to advance objectives. It's not just about talking and listening to everything, but also about putting forth one's arguments and views. Make sense? It can be approached as a 2-way street.
In terms of the "State", my point was that Satoshi respected its power and ability to kill Bitcoin. It would be sensible and wise for the community to understand the same, and act intelligently (aka, not being openly provocative and encouraging crackdown). Uber did not start off as a new company and say it doesn't care about laws. It quietly built up capital reserves and launched slowly. Once it had a certain degree of power, legal cover, and relationships with governments, it proceeded more brashly and launched without care. Even then (now), it still engages governments and tries to advocate its point of view.
There is a smart way, and there is a dumb way. That's all I'm saying.

Actually, I've seen new information that has caused me to change my mind. Apparently the malleability issue was due to be fixed soon based on the network's state, so the attack only caused disruption unnecessarily. In other words, nothing new was revealed by the attack and the attack was just that, an 'attack'. It could have been discussed with Core devs privately, instead of publicly launching it and disrupting the network.

Perfectly fine! I'd rather it get tested and not contain bugs. Quality is more important than quantity, when it comes to security of money. Glad to hear work is still ongoing.


Yeah, it's early days for everyone, it seems. Hopefully, the next 6 months will be fruitful in this regard.
Top contenders I can see so far are:
* BIP 47 for reusable addresses (provides privacy, but also potential for an enhanced UX by not having to use a new address each time) -- btw its creator, Justus, is collaborating with Samourai to implement it.
* r/JoinMarket for CoinJoin-based privacy (really potentially powerful, but uses CLI so needs a GUI to be more accessible... currently wallet plugins for Electrum and Bitcoin Core are in the works) -- realtime view of its success even at this early stage can be seen via the JoinMarket order book @ 
* Merge Avoidance (if you see from the thread, breadwallet will soon be incorporating this via work done by Jonathan Hope)
One other question... I love the low price point of HW.1, 16 USD yet still offers the same level of security as Nano. But, I think price needs to continue to fall further, perhaps to 5 USD or even 1 USD (??). Is this possible, or being planned for? -- The lower it falls, the more easily high volumes can be shipped. If it's really true that security offered by specialized hardware wallets, like Ledger line, far surpasses traditional options (like trusting Apple's admittedly secure iOS 9 for iOS SPV wallets), then I can envision Bitcoin companies and exchanges providing their users with a hardware wallet for free, to show their devotion to security and build customer loyalty. Thoughts?
Another thing. Does Ledger use SPV? If not, is it on the roadmap? I think, outside of a full node, SPV represents a much more secure and dependable and decentralized option than relying on a centralized server model (i.e. a trusted third party (TTP) or security hole, according to Nick Szabo).
Anyway, good luck!

This is absolutely not the argument being made. In the current implementation of FitCoin, before it 'eventually moves to its own alt-coin', it gives the user 20 cents/hour worth of bitcoin (a minuscule amount). In the future idea of a company using the technology, the user would get paid money to use a company's fitness products. This money represents a discount and also incentivizes use of the company's product. Presumably, the customer would have a good experience and would be encouraged to again buy the same company's products in the future (for the product, and to continue earning future discounts).
For the company to use an alt-coin custom cryptocurrency instead of bitcoin, it would appear to make little to no difference in terms of ROI. If a product cost originally $50... and the user earned $10 worth of bitcoins or $10 worth of the company's custom alt-coin, the user is going to spend $40 of his/her own money and $10 of the company's money (the 'discount' earned through use/loyalty), regardless. The company gets $40 of outside money and gives a discount of $10, either way. Using the premier cryptocurrency network/unit (by many orders of magnitude), as opposed to some crap-coin, is thus simply the sensible route to take.
By the way, as another user mentioned, the marketing aspect can still be incorporated by creating AdidasCoin 'on top' of bitcoin somehow, thus retaining AdidasCoin on the surface while still being 'powered by Bitcoin' network.

Not compromising one's position, in the face of vast disagreement by equally-qualified other people, between their position and your position, is defined in my book as being: stubborn, lack of humility, not a team player, uninterested in the big picture, unwilling to focus on the greater good and move forward, unable to accept error and move on, etc.
Imagine if every single developer had the same personality or idea. Absolutely nothing would get done, Bitcoin wouldn't be able to move forward, there would just always be complete logjam. Bitcoin works on a "consensus" basis furthermore, so it's just unworkable.

No, that's too much to ask for :) Users don't deserve to have any choice in the matter. They should be happy to use the default fee, and be happy with the resulting confirmation time. Or, as Breadwallet founder, Voisine, has historically believed, you don't even need to wait for confirmations in BTC because 0-conf. transactions are good enough (and if merchants don't agree, tell them to accept 0-conf.) -- I suspect this philosophy may be one of the factors behind the strangely long delay in allowing a custom fee.

Great, thanks! Hopefully some wizardry/genius can ameliorate those issues.
I delved into sidechains more after I made my comment, and the amount of innovation/flexion/extension introduced by the technology would seem to be incredible. If Lightning (clever usage of mostly existing technological tools: multi-sig, time lock, etc.) is possible with the existing Bitcoin tech alone, then imagining the possibilities after the addition of another major tool, like 'sidechains', in the available toolkit is just unreal. If sidechain tech is done right, the sky could really become the limit for Bitcoin.
For those interested, direct info on sidechains' potential (and lots of other valuable &amp; insightful info) can be found in the comments by Adam Black, one of the lead developers of Blockstream (responsible for sidechain tech dev.):

Hmm, I think anyone would trust Bitcoin's security and 'chances' way more than Monero's, hence why the market grants the former a 1,000x higher market cap. Arguing the other direction, that 1,000x higher market cap incentives its participants that much more to address security issues and maintain the system.
Basically, I think you're approaching this the wrong way. It will be an *asset* for Monero to become a sidechain, as it will gain greater dev. support and benefit from Bitcoin's network effect.
The alternative is the very real, actually inevitable, possibility that Monero gets sidestepped altogether, as someone else RootStocks Monero (i.e. takes Monero and makes it into a sidechain, thereby replacing the 'monero' with 'bitcoin').
Another alternative is that Zerocash is successful in the next 4 months and turned into a sidechain, a situation which would also result in Monero's sidestepping and its descent into irrelevance.
The way to confront these problematic future scenarios is to make plans on how to successfully transition Monero from altcoin to sidechain, and begin implementing as quickly as possible (i.e. follow RootStock's model, except with the benefit of not having to finish developing a brand new system like Ethereum).

Actually, the analogous statement would be "Bitcoin is powered by bitcoin," which I agree does not mean much.
In this case, I was saying "Abra is powered by Bitcoin," which represents the fact that Abra uses the Bitcoin network (and bitcoins, implicitly) to transfer money across countries (and between different fiat currencies) by using local 'tellers'/agents as the intermediary.

Anyone who was anyone in the Bitcoin developer community attended the Montreal Scaling Bitcoin conference.
As for LN, either he doesn't understand proposals like LN (or worse, hasn't taken time to try to understand them), or he isn't creative enough to appreciate the value they bring... and this, in spite of tons of people in the community having peer reviewed LN over the last 6 months and expressing support. Anything worth doing takes effort, and if LN requires lots of effort to bring to fruition, then that makes it worth ignoring? That's been Mike's position.
When someone behaves like this, I think it's natural that other developers will lose respect for the person and slowly stop caring what that person thinks.

Hey Charlie, going back to our conversation from a week ago, the latest set of tweets by Brian seem to confirm my original suspicion (that linking to XT's PDF was an implicit sign):
*

* 
I mean this literally spells out XT's model and XT's guiding beliefs [hard forks are good; there should be competing forks (legitimizes XT's existence); if there is loss of confidence, elect new group (again legitimizes XT); fork should have final decision maker at top (exactly XT's model with Hearn at top); hard forks are not bad or scary (yet again this represents XT's talking points, ignoring the fact that consensus-rule-change forks ARE A SEPARATE ISSUE from non-consensus-rule-change forks)].
Combine it with the news that Coinbase is now part of "Blockchain Alliance", and enthusiastic about working to rid Bitcoin of "criminal" activity in conjunction with FBI, DoJ, DHS, etc., and it makes me very anxious about the future.

Yeah, markets need to move steadily back to previous ATH ($1,100). If markets surge after that in bubble fashion, then fine. They can descend back to some level about that previous ATH, and it could be a sustainable level. If, now itself, we just surge higher, there's a lot more chance we get locked below the previous ATH and cannot break through it.
Then again, if the rally is based on fundamentals, rather than pure speculation, then anything can happen.

No problem; more info is here, although it's always changing so not necessarily perfectly up to date:


@_date: 2015-11-02 18:55:23




XT is literally an implementation in which 1 person decides what goes in and what stays (!).
Core is a system in which there are many developers working in unison to decide what gets implemented, via consensus. There is no centralization in that. It is open-discussion based development. I don't know how else to say this, to make it any more clear. The way Mike characterizes Core dev is a lie.
@_date: 2015-11-28 21:25:26
We have 2 "real" alternative implementations (not "hard fork clients" like XT), and they are: btcd + libbitcoin (run by OpenBazaar + Airbitz).
There is also a Core dev effort called "libconsensus", that aims to separate consensus rules from the other rules, and thus make it easier for alternative implementations to be created safely.
However, I do understand the concern, from a longer term perspective. Even if current dev. team of Core is benevolent and acting in the public's best interest, how do we ensure it in the future? I really don't know the answer.
One idea I've tossed around is to expedite development as much as possible, and get to a point at which the core protocol (layer 1) can be ossified and made so that it is extremely difficult to change. This way, the core Bitcoin protocol will be protected. If new features are desired, then they can be implemented as "layer 2" (outside core protocol) additions. That way, they become opt-in, rather than opt-out changes that are forced onto every user.
^ How we can exactly successfully achieve the above, I'm not clear on. I think it could go some ways to addressing the issue, though.
The "layer 2" opt-in approach might be able to be achieved via sidechains (pick what you want)? I'm not sure how the core protocol can be ossified and made near impossible to change, though (or if that's even a good idea).

Eliminate psychological barrier that it can be hacked and stolen, an idea perpetuated by various bitcoin thefts. If users can feel safe with this exotic technology, then they may be able to get over the barrier of "fearing what they don't understand" and feel more comfortable using it.
With $, there's no fear of losing your money (banks reimburse), so BTC needs to reach a similar if not same level.
The other 'issue', volatility, may be 'solved' naturally after this, as greater adoption increases price. As price increases, liquidity increases, and the ecosystem is incentivized and given ability to develop even further. Gradually, the market would be expected to stabilize and become less volatile.

People like the Drapers invest for the longterm, with 5-10 year horizons. Or whatever horizon is appropriate for the particular investment.
Think about it this way: if an investment was bought at 600, then it falls to 200, but then ultimately rises 5-10 years later to 10,000... then from 600 it represents a 17x gain, while from 200 it represents a 50x gain. Either way, it's a great gain (20 million to 320 million, or 20 million to 1 billion). It's not possible to 'pick the bottom' and invest then. They picked an entry point, based on their own situation.

Horribly weak argument, try again.
It's called capitalism and globalism. Companies locate where they can pay the lowest salaries that will get done the work they require. There's nothing abnormal about this. Every company does that.
As for why Apple makes so much money? Because they price some of their products at a premium, but people are still willing to pay the premium because of the high quality. Apple makes 92% of the entire smartphone industry's profits, as an example. Apple is the richest company on the planet because they are uniquely successful at giving customers exactly what they want, and delivering the highest quality product overall.
Anyway, this has little to do with VALUES, and the fact that Bitcoin can learn a valuable lesson from Apple's willingness to stand up to corrupt institutions, to defend those values. This is why Snowden publicly cites Apple for doing what is right, and why Apple's CEO has also publicly praised Snowden.
* "If Snowden did anything for us at all, then it was to get us to talk more about these things. [Apple’s] values have always been the same." "Privacy Is A Fundamental Human Right" - Tim Cook
* "Basic technical safeguards such as encryption — once considered esoteric and unnecessary — are now enabled by default in the products of pioneering companies like Apple, ensuring that even if your phone is stolen, your private life remains private," Snowden said.
Tim Cook has also spoken very specifically on privacy, in a way that Bitcoin can very directly learn from!

We know transactions take average of ~10 min per confirmation. So, the highest probability time a user has would be... ~10 min. Sure, it "can be anything from hours, minutes but also mere seconds after sending it" -- but I fail to see how that is relevant in a practical sense. Having a 10-min window on average seems extremely good (certainly better than the lack of any window right now).
@_date: 2015-10-08 16:29:24


I'm not re-defining anything here. I'm speaking to the practical effect, which hopefully we can agree is what really matters? For example, see the pre-attack and post-attack situation in terms of average fee/KB paid:


It is a data-backed picture of the situation pre- and post-. It's clear that spam txs aren't paying a 'normal' fee, but a 'spam' fee. Hence, they are illegitimate and can be safely excluded. As you said: "in normal operation there is only around 500kb on average of legit transactions" -- this is all I'm talking about. We are distinguishing legit vs. spam txs.


I also want to address this. I think this is false, because users are incentivized to pay whatever they are willing to bear to get their transactions confirmed. Ditto with Coinbase or Circle, which pay their users' fees. Users and businesses just want confirmation, and will pay fees, to a limit, to achieve it. Thus, the current system allows all legitimate transactions to pass through, while ignoring spammers. Spammers *are* incentivized to pay as low fees as possible, on the contrary, I'd argue (as we can in practice). As such, prioritizing paying users is a great way to make sure all legit txs are confirmed.
I agree still that we can't rely on this. If a spammer comes along with a big budget, we are defenseless. I'm not sure what solution is good enough to deal with such a situation. Do you know of something?

In term of the Alpha Roadmap, it says Alpha 3 is due in November 2015. Is this schedule still in effect?
Is the JoinMarket integration still being done for Alpha 3? Can you share your progress in it, or experience with it? Are you working with u/belcher_ on it? It currently seems to be the best option for Bitcoin privacy.
In terms of stealth addresses, have you decided on an implementation? This is another very important technology. We recently had BIP 47 (reusable payment codes) released, which if you look up the Reddit threads on it, got a very good review (like 95% upvote and 350 votes). It is not perfect, as it causes block chain bloat apparently, but it seems to do the job and that's what matters at this stage. It was also reviewed favorably by Peter Todd and possibly Greg Maxwell, too. Anyway, I do recommend BIP 47.
Regarding the Shapeshift mention in the Roadmap, I'm skeptical that can be applied for privacy use. Shapeshift keeps logs as it's required to do, and there is also a 1-2% conversion fee in both directions, so 2-4% net conversion fee. In other words, it does not seem like a good idea... it's likely better to stick with implementing JoinMarket in a complete manner (let user send every transaction via JM, allow user to customize how many parties to CJ with &amp; how many sets to run, etc.) and BIP 47.

Right. This issue needs to be widely promoted, which is that Bitcoin.com Forum is not some oasis of freedom of censorship. It is a private forum, which is run on a website that is explicitly "for-profit". The only legitimate alternative is something that is truly free. For that, something decentralized like  may be the answer, once it is ready.
Said website "promotes wallets" based on how much the wallet pays the website, rather than objectively displaying wallets on merit of security and features and ease-of-use and privacy -- a policy that is horrible for the Bitcoin ecosystem in terms of ensuring safety of user funds &amp; good experience.
I should also add that if the Forum succeeds in gaining real traffic, then Bitcoin.com will be pushed higher in Google Search Results. This means this harmful policy of promoting wallets based on who pays more, rather than merit, will become more prominent and more new Bitcoin users will suffer.

Ever consider this belief is justified by evidence that is a direct result of such beliefs twisting peoples' minds and encouraging troll posts? Because that's a distinct possibility. It's also circular logic. I think requirements for evidence should be much more exacting than mere observation of something like that. Especially, when the claim is so potentially slanderous ("mods are being paid by Blockstream's funders").
Agree with the rest of your post, in theory. Vigilance is good, but trolling a company for no good reason (i.e. without evidence) is more defined as 'attacking', rather than being vigilant.

True true, good point. Banks buying and selling bitcoins frequently would be akin to the big institutional buyers and sellers and market makers in typical markets, and increase liquidity.
One issue though, what would be the catalyst in this situation for price to increase? In other words, banks want to be able to buy and sell with no slippage. This requires very liquid markets and a much higher bitcoin price. But, what would catalyze this situation to occur? Why will money enter bitcoin to push price higher?
Actually, a sustained higher price would probably equal higher liquidity, so the question is limited to: "What would cause price to increase sustainably, to allow banks to buy/sell bitcoins without slippage?"

Btw, breadwallet allows spending of unconfirmed transactions, so the instant transaction time is practically useful if the user uses breadwallet.
I understand you're discussing why people dislike Bitcoin. I was trying (but apparently failing) to clear up that transactions take 10 minutes for 1 confirmation (assuming sufficient fee) on average. Transactions follow a Poisson distribution, so times can be much less than 10 minutes or much more than 10 minutes, but it averages to 10. That randomness can't be changed with Bitcoin, and I agree it's not desirable from a user's point-of-view. Hopefully layer 2 services like Lightning will make it less an issue, since it would allow *instant* confirmation.

What you're saying is either objectively false or illogical, so why even say it? Proof below.


Gavin participated in this meeting, unlike in the last couple meetings.


As you noted, HK conference is weeks away, so discussion would occur there. Why should it be brought up now? Many are working on scalability BIPs right now, which will be presented at HK.


What was explicitly said in the notes was "opt-in RBF", not "RBF".


Two prominent thought leaders, Hal Finney and Szabo (in addition of course to many Core devs), have both advocated this approach of: layer 1 = settlement layer, and layer 2 = lightweight mass-scaling layer.
It's funny (i.e. 'sad') that Ethereum and other communities respect such people's views, but a minority of Bitcoin's community will openly bash such people and disregard their views (and, in so doing, have the arrogance to think they know better than such people, and refuse to properly consider their views).
Also, recently, Chris Odom of 'Open Transactions' (Stash Crypto) praised Adam Back (and Blockstream in general) for his/its/their work (so cue the cries of yet another extremely smart guy, Chris Odom, also being corrupted by evil Blockstream?):


Simply put, this is the only way to scale Bitcoin while also keeping it trust-minimized and censorship-resistant (since it helps keep block size as small as possible, and reduce node/mining system requirements = helps keep the system running efficiently). I don't know why this concept is so hard to understand, but it's a little irritating that it has to be repeated over and over and over.

This is equal to 1,000 satoshis/KB, or 1 satoshi/byte. The spam, from what I observed superficially, mostly had a fee rate of 1 satoshi/byte or less. That's likely why the default hasn't worked well, while simply doubling or tripling it, as you did, solved the problem.
I'm just concerned because next time, spam could simply increase the fee/size more than 5x the current default (to get past minrelaytxfee=0.00005), in order to get past the change. The cost of attack would be minimal either way. I think there are other changes being made to deal with the issue though, which is why Jeff says "work has been underway for months".

I think I've also more than adequately explained how Bitcoin companies can make money *and* be on the right side of history, as far as defending privacy and security go, by taking cues from Apple and its CEO's public remarks. I agree they should stay compliant (non-compliance means they shut down), but that can be done while also vociferously stating their belief in the fundamental human right of privacy... and going from there. They can build a public case for it, lobby, and get political support for the position. That's how these things work. The government is not going to pick a highly public fight, especially with a company of Apple's stature on our side.

Interesting, at least it seems we're getting more to the heart of the matter.
I don't deny the possibility or probability of attacks on Bitcoin in the future, in terms of trying to co-opt development, but I think you're missing something. I think the idea behind Bitcoin is that its participants will always support what is in their best interest. Thus, it's designed for a single consensus system where lots of people are getting together to agree on the best way forward. Why? Because we assume the vast majority wants what is best for Bitcoin. So, having forks of consensus does not make sense (because that produces an altcoin with separate rules and hence fractures Bitcoin and its market cap)... but sure, having forks of the implementation (like btcd or libbitcoin) certainly makes sense and is fine, since consensus rules are kept the same.
The current system is as it is after 7 years because these developers have done a great job at managing the project. People easily forget that, and pretend like there is an actual problem that needs to be fixed. I mean, it's possible some developers in Core have been ignoring the issue of scalability because there was no one simple clear answer. So, in that regard, the agitation helped put people out of their trance and focus on the problem. This may have been what precipitated the invention and release of the Lightning idea.
When the vast majority of Bitcoin developers think scaling needs to be done carefully (while a tiny minority -- Gavin and Mike -- think it's not a big deal and we can increase 8x or 20x in one go and let it increase per annum at 41% for 20 years), the only rational interpretation is that one side is being careless and the other side may have a point to not rush things. Instead, some people seem to think that because it's "Gavin" who says it, we should ignore all the other experts and just listen to the 1 expert (Gavin). I say this to explain that Gavin and Mike's proposal is but a single idea, and many other ideas have been put forward (yet people foolishly ascribe more credit than is due, simply because it's Gavin.. and to a lesser extent, Mike).


So, getting back to this point. I disagree, since the design of Bitcoin encourages consensus building (it's the only way to keep any critical mass with a single set of consensus rules -- aka a single fork). It's not designed for people to constantly be splitting off from the main consensus rules and forking away. That wouldn't achieve anything. XT and Mike know this, which is why the least possible % was chosen; 75% of the community must agree, after which point XT replaces Core (the idea is that Core will melt away and fold itself into XT). The idea has never been for XT to gain 75% acceptance, while Core remains a separate entity with 25% of the community and market cap! The other problem is that research shows 75% is insufficient, since like I've said, it can easily allow the 25% member to remain intact and separate (hence fracturing Bitcoin into two coins that are incompatible with one another). The better idea is to make XT require 95%, if in fact it was intended as a legitimate hard fork and trying to win over the community... but it did not decide this, presumably because that would be too difficult to achieve.
My final criticism is that XT clearly has not gained traction, yet Mike's actions seem intent on not going out without a fight, even if it means Bitcoin burns. It has been roundly slammed by the vast majority of the Bitcoin community's experts (for a variety of reasons, including its governance model that puts full decision making power into a single, rash, person -- Mike). It languishes with almost zero miner support, and 10% of nodes. Yet, instead of accepting defeat and being courteous about it (like you suggest should happen in the event of failure of a fork), Mike instead goes on the offensive and tries to rally the support of his troops to fight, criticize, slander, etc.
And, all this despite the creation of a Bitcoin scaling conference! I thought the issue the whole time was scaling? No? It certainly doesn't feel like the issue is about scaling anymore, for XT, but rather it's become all about taking over power and having the solution follow his rule. He has separated himself from the other Bitcoin experts (even Gavin! Gavin was gracious and sensible enough to recognize what I've said in this post, and to attend the conference and work with the others to try to figure something out -- huge kudos to him for finally separating himself from the toxic grasp of Mike's uncompromising approach), and refused to participate in the rest of the community's scaling work.
:: **tl;dr** :: (of one of the main points, though I made other points too! such as the point that Bitcoin DOES in fact work off a consensus system -- proven by the fact that one needs 95% support for a new fork, to keep everyone on the same chain and prevent disruption caused by creating 2 incompatible coins with separate market caps)
If forking Bitcoin's consensus simply meant that we had a new reference client (like btcd or libbitcoin), then you would be correct that it's "just a fork" -- XT, however, is not this. It 'activates' in Jan. 2016 and separates itself from the current block chain, thus becoming incompatible and effecting creating an altcoin that splits Bitcoin's market cap in two and causes widespread disruption and risk of double spending, IF the other 25% does not agree to fold itself into XT. And, there's no guarantee, simply based on the structural reason of 75/25 not being a big enough majority. 95/5 would solve the problem and make the issue a non-issue. If XT converted from 75/25 to 95/5, all opposition including my own would likely dissipate.
It is because things are 75/25, that Mike's actions (and XT in general) are extremely dangerous and irresponsible. The Bitcoin experts know this, which is why Mike and XT gets so much flak from them. Normal users seem to miss the point, or are convinced by Mike's insistence that everything is fine and 75/25 is more than enough majority, so he attracts the support of such people (it also helps that we have propaganda implying: Core is co-opted by Blockstream, is corrupt, is stupid, is 'just a bunch of neckbeards', is small-blockers who want to 'strangle' Bitcoin, etc. etc. etc.).
So to summarize, you have indeed made a good point that different starting points is the cause of this divide. However, the reason is not correct. The real reason is lack of appreciation of the 95/5 vs. 75/25 majority differences, and the implication that consensus IS in fact required... and not just any majority (75%) consensus, but a really clear majority (i.e. 95%). Failing to adhere to this means real risks of dividing Bitcoin ($3.5 billion) into: Bitcoin ("x" market cap) and Bitcoin XT ("y" market cap). Of course, the world's respect for Bitcoin will plummet if such a thing happened, as it would mean absolute chaos in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

I don't know how familiar you are with the Bitcoin competitor Ethereum, but Ethereum is also supported by Armstrong, and is infamous lately for having a failed hard-fork change.

Communities will split for any number of reasons. Being afraid of a "community split" is not a reason to abandon technically meritorious decisions (i.e. it's more important to have a functioning system, than risk the system's collapse just because some people who like conspiracy theories don't understand how Bitcoin works and like to complain a lot).
As for "respected" Core devs who work on hardfork clients, they are in the absolute minority of Core devs, and have freedom to do as they please. Why is that a reason? Those devs have a difference of opinion with the majority of their technical peers, so they are free to leave. They also have had a difference of opinion for many years. Gavin's views, in general, are incompatible with the views of the rest of his former team. It's better Gavin split off 1.5 years ago, rather than dragging the disagreement on.


I hear this a lot from people on the other sub (are you sure you're actually "in the middle" and neutral?), but never see any evidence. Care to enlighten me as to how the roadmap "directly benefits the company" that pays their salaries? If you mean "off-chain solutions" benefit Blockstream, then this conspiracy theory is false and has no evidence to back it up. But I'm open to evidence, if you have some.
BTW, another false statement in there is that Blockstream pays "core dev salaries". Blockstream pays *some* salaries of Core devs, but many Core devs (90+ worked on 0.12) work for free or are paid by other organizations.

Okay, let's suppose we lifted the cap. Wouldn't it disrupt the network more by putting many more nodes offline, than have gone offline due to crashing by a large mempool? So, isn't that a net worse effect? It's good the attacker gets penalized by eating the tx fees cost, but he will also get real results in terms of attacking the network.
Right now, it seems a simple solution to mitigate the attack, since rather than having to upgrade bandwidth (which is the bottleneck and very limited in many places), one just needs to upgrade / allocate more RAM and CPU and storage to deal with a large mempool. Prioritizing txs by fee means the spam txs get ignored, while legit txs pass through unscathed.
During every spam attack, I've even tested the network's response by sending a small amount (less than $5) with breadwallet's fee (often 42 bits), and it's always been confirmed very quickly. -- In other words, I don't think the spam attack is affecting the network's legit txs. It's only affecting nodes (-10%), which as I've explained can more easily be taken care of (than needing to upgrade bandwidth to process the large blocks implicit with an uncapped system).

Scalability is absolutely a top-line consideration.

How can this be practically achieved, when the current system exists? It is with the current system in place that things have gotten to where they are.
Do you suggest the developers basically firewall themselves from the community, and only consider ideas from miners &amp; businesses &amp; major bitcoin investors? That would seem to limit the 'noise' and increase the 'signal', and let developers focus clearly on what matters.
Even then though, how is that secure? Users run the 5,500+ full nodes. If users don't feel listened to, then users may mutiny and run different software. If you do listen to users, then you have to explain paradoxical concepts, and deal with populism. Where is the solution?
Maybe if miners &amp; businesses &amp; large investors really feel listened to and can engage in productive discussion with developers, then those groups will help sell the ideas back to the community and reassure them that things are fine. Plus, the users will know that the devs, miners, businesses, and large investors are all aligned, and so their mutiny will never succeed anyway.

Hardly, what you linked first requires converting BTC to XMR, and then using that site (which converts the XMR back to BTC, and sends it to a BTC address).
If you love XMR so much, please go to the XMR subreddit and wax eloquent about it as much as you like, instead of writing half-truths designed to indirectly pump XMR.
Please stop spamming.

That's not how this works.
If someone wants to claim that 'cobra' works for Blockstream, they better first have evidence for that claim.
If someone wants to claim 'cobra' doesn't work for Blockstream, well, that's impossible in a sense (since it's usually not possible to prove a negative).
In this case, we have a co-founder of Blockstream (gmaxwell) publicly confirming that 'cobra' has never worked for Blockstream ( which is as good a proof as can be expected.

Not really; was in the right, considering there was already reason to believe (to anyone who bothered to do some research into who 'cobra' was -- we know right off the bat that 'cobra' is a co-owner of bitcoin.org, and that he has historically never been associated with Blockstream).

On second thought, while it pushes the boundaries, I'm a little skeptical. We already have very many well-designed websites. It doesn't seem like a problem that is impossible to solve, or all that difficult either. It's also not truly "AI", but rather machine learning. I've seen some examples by users of what the service generated, and it hasn't impressed me. It does some things well, and it may be good for helping users post their media in an attractive way. Beyond that, for anything more complicated or involving intelligence regarding the actual content and its context, it seems to be lacking.

Yes, but the iPhone would ideally be fully updated to the latest iOS and use a new iPhone with the secure enclave. Also, it might be safer to put breadwallet in airplane mode and generate a 12-word seed along with a receive address/QR code. Then, wipe the wallet. Then you can transfer bitcoins to the address, and save the 12-word-seed and address/QR somewhere safe. That way it would be truly cold.

u/ThePiachu, I don't think this is a "proposal by W3C". "Interledger" is a proposal authored by Ripple reps, and simply a group hosted by W3C, but not endorsed by W3C:




Bitcoin is already an open-source, free, and neutral protocol.
It suggests Bitcoin and Ripple are on the same level, which is a joke. It also suggests there is any sort of legitimate competition to Bitcoin that needs to be accommodated, which there isn't. Bitcoin is worth billions of USD, and with an ecosystem and development community to match. What does Ripple have? What does any competing proposal or altcoin have? Nothing, relatively speaking. Either way, altcoins are already cross-compatible and easily exchangeable with Bitcoin, as they are all cryptocurrencies.


Bitcoin does not require a central operator. Why shouldn't it use a globally accepted currency or blockchain? Is this advocating we use a restricted-availability currency? Odd.

Hi Erik,
Nice to see yet another another public tantrum about a private bitcoin subreddit's policies -- this time, regarding altcoins. And, that too coming directly from an individual who heads an altcoin exchange. No conflict of interest there, right? And, no impropriety on your part, as far as not fact-finding in a private manner (like everyone does) by messaging mods. No, you are special. So, every time you find something you don't like, you take it upon yourself to publicly throw a tantrum. This has gone on how many times now? And, how many times must we courteously tell you to bother to do your research, get the details and facts of a situation, before making these hysterical assumptions?


Correct. This is a *bitcoin* subreddit, and altcoin discussion should not even be happening here.
I do understand the business (Shapeshift) requires a steady stream of suckers to feed upon, so that they may gamble away their bitcoins (10 billion USD market cap) betting on altcoin shitcoins (one with a market cap of 1 billion (that recently fell 50% in a matter of hours), and the rest dwindling rapidly to market caps of 200 million and less than 100 million -- a variety of which are straight pump 'n dumps -- equivalent to penny stocks, hence 'shitcoin' moniker).
However, is not a source to prey upon to generate revenue for Shapeshift. There are certain other bitcoin subreddits which happily allow altcoin pumping. Try those?
This article and the others (like the Bitcoin Magazine piece) are only being allowed, since they conclude the episode for which articles about ETH/DAO were previously allowed (allowed, only because it was major news whose relevance to bitcoin philosophy &amp; development was explicitly discussed at the time -- since some think bitcoin development style should mimic ethereum development style of 'move fast and break things'). We get all sorts of conflicted requests, to either keep ETH news or remove it because it's spam and off-topic. For example, [this user]( commented in this thread, wondering why the thread was allowed. What are we to do? Just remove all such threads? And then what? People like you, Erik, will complain that *no* threads on the matter are being approved, and that there is mass censorship and stunting of readers' intellectual growth (lol) by restricting articles on ETH/DAO! :O
Thus, ultimately, it is upto moderator discretion, since the rule is explicit that altcoin pumping is not allowed.


In your list, 5 things are removed (not 'banned' -- only users can be banned):
* "270 infographics" (removed automatically, later approved, I think)
* "why are there no posts mentioning the ethereum network split" (removed for obvious reasons)
* "need to buy some btc" (removed automatically, later approved, I think)
* "WSJ article" (removed because of subreddit policy, but later we chose to approve some articles -- in fact, I was going to submit the WSJ article myself, but others had already been approved by then; also, btw, this article contains 'negative' sentiment too, yet we removed it. Conspiracy?)
* "other coin now has dual forks, what a joke" (removed due to subreddit policy, later re-submitted with neutral title -- notice we removed this, even though it was a negative title. Oh wait, I thought only allows negative sentiment?).


Oh, no! Let's get emotional! As discussed, altcoin discussion is off-topic on this bitcoin subreddit. Hence, it was removed. And, for your information, the WSJ article was also negative sentiment (obviously, since the ETH HF episode is a negative episode). Yet, it was still removed.
As I explained above, mods later changed their mind (since this addresses an issue previously discussed here) and did not remove future articles that were submitted (including the Forbes one, among others). I even considered re-submitting the WSJ article, but there were enough ETH articles by then.


Again, let me make it clear that you have a lot of nerve saying such things &amp; even making such posts, when you operate an altcoin-dependent market exchange (Shapeshift) as your business. The conflict-of-interest here is off the charts. You should not be speaking on such topics; you should recuse yourself, for ethical reasons. For you to be speaking in a self-righteous manner, in this example, is quite beyond the pale. Whether or not is a proudly maximalist subreddit, or not, is frankly not your concern. You can visit or or other altcoin-pumping-friendly Bitcoin subreddits, if you're interested in unrestricted altcoin pumping, so as to generate interest for altcoins to feed Shapeshift revenues. Otherwise, those who wish to read about altcoins certainly can visit other subreddits like to indulge.
You have made it a habit, since first starting your Shapeshift altcoin exchange, to periodically pump one altcoin or another here: sometimes Nubits (whose peg recently collapsed FYI), sometimes another 'flavor of the day'. These days, it seems to be ETH/DAO. Certain exceptions regarding altcoin discussion are made at the discretion of moderators, for a variety of reasons. Example: In this case, ETH/DAO is being allowed to help provide closure to the previously heavily-discussed event. Other than that though, the rules are quite explicit regarding altcoins.
This subreddit is by and for Bitcoiners, who are interested in topics relevant to Bitcoin that help it achieve success. In this vein, moderators have made a clear decision (since the beginning) not to tolerate altcoin discussion. Altcoins are traded on exchanges and have monetary value, so they are inherently going to be pumped, if allowed, to gullible newbies who can be seduced with dreams of getting rich by gambling on the latest pump 'n dump. You may consider this a 'free market' in that it's 'okay' for newbies to be probably fleeced, as long as Shapeshift can profit in the meantime, and that it's 'fair'; but, this is unethical. The subreddit is not to be used for this purpose, and altcoins are still off-limits, except in special circumstances at moderator discretion.

I should probably first read your reply to me from that other thread, but... your argument here doesn't make sense to me because Core and XT are different implementations with different consensus rules (due to activate in Jan. 2016). Criticism of "one dominant implementation" is fine, but that's where libconsensus comes into play. Until then, that's also where btcd and libbitcoin enter the picture, as different implementations with same consensus rules. You can't just group all these things into the same chart and categorize them as equal.
The other criticism of the pie chart is that 'Core' is not monolithic as purported. Different versions are in use, each with differences in code. A more accurate chart would show that.

Ah, thanks for clarifying. I should have realized this myself, hah, it's obvious in retrospect!

cc: u/nullc -- Relates to mining &amp; decentralization &amp; incentives
Hey u/luke-jr, I finally found our conversation regarding bitcoin mining and botnets! What a chore.
So, I just came across Satoshi's post in regards to botnets, which I think is quite illustrative, and defends botnets as an unfortunate compromise:


Relate that 'first principles' concept to this later statement by Satoshi, which is just unbelievably genius in its thought process and pulling together of disparate concepts (like the 'long tail theory'):
















Obviously, nothing is "ideal" about using botnets, but if there's no other option for a decentralized resistant network, then there is no other choice. We need to be pragmatic, as Satoshi is, and focus on what can work in the real world.
This is what I suspected too, as I'd written to you before that botnets are not really "criminals", just interested in making profit, albeit unethically. Anyway, I think solutions need to be devised with the assumption that botnets are "OK". Ideas need to be reoriented to block actors malicious to the network, not judge actors based on their rationale for wanting to mine (since mining = securing the network). Bitcoin's genius is that anyone from anywhere can use it, regardless of their motivations or ideologies. It's a system that incentivizes its own security and proliferation, sort of like a virus.

Why cite one person, as if he represents the majority of Bitcoin experts? Luke does not represent everyone. Citing him, as if he does, is dishonest. I'm kinda tired of seeing his name repeated endlessly. Btw, even Luke now supports increasing block size, according to the BIP that uses Cisco's end-user bandwidth projections for the next 5 years.
Sure, an attacker will know what fee to attach, but the point is it makes it more expensive for an attacker and therefore more cost-prohibitive. The previous flooding relied on sending extremely cheap fee/size transactions. This change will prevent that attack from being possible, thus stopping mempools from expanding unreasonably and crashing nodes.
I already acknowledged that it's not perfect, in the sense that it pushes up minimum cost. But even in that regard, it's not as simple as that. It only takes effect when nodes are threatened by spamming attacks. In normal operation, txs with 'low' fees are still accepted.
On balance, I can't say that this is worse than XT's tactic. If you disagree, feel free to specifically explain why and how what I've said above is worse.

Ugh. Need I remind everyone, that none should have narratives they are trying to push? The only narrative is, contrite as it may seem, "what is good for bitcoin". And what is good for bitcoin('s price) will typically be the easiest &amp; most direct way to answer the question. And what determines that? Utility. Which leads to demand. Which unbalances the supply/demand equation, hence causing price to rise.
What leads to the answer? Truthful information and objective analysis. Pushing a "narrative" only serves to pollute this essential first step in the research process.
@_date: 2015-10-02 23:42:06
Are you justifying a no-cap block size? What you're saying could make sense, but free market (supply and demand finding an equilibrium) seems to be a poor way to decide this. How does decentralization factor into it? How would decentralization be what the free market prioritizes?
I have a feeling if bitcoin were to become regulated (if miners decided to allow KYC/AML and ditto with nodes), then adoption would skyrocket as governments would be very happy with such a transparent, trackable, controllable, digital system. It would be much more appealing than cash. So, adoption would likely skyrocket and price may follow. Miners would probably also love this (higher price = higher profit) and eventually fold to pressure and allow it.
In that case, I don't see the free market leading to a good outcome (maintaining bitcoin as a useful network). I don't think massive price appreciation is a good outcome, if the currency also becomes subject to controls.
This is why I think everything must be done to increase decentralization and defend that, while also increasing utility (by figuring out scalability) in a responsible way. Yes, mining right now is a pretty bad situation, but that is reason to do something to improve it, not to throw one more variable into the mix (uncapped block size) and subject the outcome to the will of the 'free market'.

Yes, and your accompanying tweets. You have repeated this behavior more times than I care to count. Every single time, you waste mods' time with this baseless drama. Every single time, we try to politely tell you to have some more responsibility, and do some more due diligence. The same pattern repeats, however.


Maybe you should read what I said. I already covered the WSJ article in the previous post, e.g. I myself was going to post it, but did not because there were already posts on the topic. You should read my previous post more carefully, because this was covered.


Straw man. No one is talking about circle jerking to moon gifs.
You know, the developers and researchers, who do the actual work on developing the protocol, are well aware of the other cryptocurrencies (your euphemism as "blockchain assets") and their competing tech, and they work to incorporate what works in Bitcoin, and leave out what does not. Gmaxwell just recently was even helping with some Ethereum Classic development. However, is *not* the place for altcoin promotion; I hope this is clear.
And, yes, you have a conflict of interest. Keep denying it, or running away from this fact all you want, but it does not change it. You have 95% in BTC? Great, where's the proof? Even hypothetically assuming you provided proof, your conflict of interest with Shapeshift (purveyor of altcoins) would still remain. You have no basis to speak on the matter of altcoin promotion, especially in a subreddit dedicated to bitcoin.


That's good that you messaged a mod, but why not message the "mods" as a whole? There are quite a few of us, you know. One may be busy at some time, but another may not. And yes, the expectation is to bring it to the gatekeepers (mods) of the subreddit, instead of whining about it like a child on Twitter or Reddit. This is called professionalism. Are you a professional? It is absolutely professional (and most others adhere to it) to bring concerns over moderation to the subreddit mods first, in order to clarify and get information that you may be missing. This way, you do not waste all of our precious time with these silly posts in public and playing games here, and creating unnecessary drama and wasting everyone's time (including readers' time). If you're unable to conduct yourself professionally, then that is your problem -- not ours. Everyone else can follow the rules; are you above the law? Above rules? A 'sovereign citizen', perhaps, to whom rules or etiquette do not apply?


Yes, obviously: an educated, wise, humble, productive community is great. However, we have made a conscious decision that it's not viable to allow general pumping altcoin discussion here (rather, only when there is major news &amp; even then only at mods' discretion, so that the news is not of a pumping nature). This is the rule of the sub, and it has been in place for a long time, if not forever.


Nope, I am stating a fact about your conflict of interest, and how it's ethical to recuse yourself from the arguing about alt-coins on r/bitcoin. You profit from altcoins through your business, and you work hard to integrate Shapeshift everywhere, like a middleman, and siphon off 1-2% roundtrip from people converting bitcoins to altcoins. Either this is true (and it is), or it's false. If true, it means you have a conflict of interest. It's time to accept it.


Technology is important/diverse/dynamic, yes, sure, but only on a tiny scale. Mostly, it's pump and dump nonsense. We don't have time as mods to individually judge each altcoin that is presented here, so the choice is to get rid of them all. Those who want to potentially gamble away their tried/tested/secure money (and potentially lose 1-2% per roundtrip trade to Shapeshift in the process) that is backed by massive testing/review, may do so, but should do that in a sub outside of the bitcoin-focused subreddit. This subreddit is not for the purpose of discussing one or the other altcoin. There are other altcoin-focused subreddits, as people are already aware.
On the other hand, your ignorant and arrogant assertion is false. It's not "arrogance of Bitcoiners" -- the developers themselves are perfectly well aware of altcoins, and discuss and debate them among themselves. Various Core devs are even involved with Monero from time to time, and at least one was involved with Ethereum in its early days. When it comes to more lay people, they are not the plaything of the shitcoin industry (of which Shapeshift is part) to prey upon, or at least, will not be party to such a thing.


I did not say "only bitcoin"; in fact, if you know anything about me, I personally have an interest in at least 1 altcoin (e.g. won't say the name to avoid promotion). This does not mean I intentionally arbitrarily allow any news/discussion of it in however, due to the previously stated reasons. It's a fact that in the altcoin industry, 99%+ are scams. Do you deny this fact? Is it inconvenient to acknowledge this, as you run Shapeshift, and have various coins listed which are quite atrocious when considering the facts of their merit?


If you think it's a net negative, that is of course disappointing to me, since I and the other mods here work extremely hard to consider different sides of each issue, and carefully produce a quality subreddit (and we devote many, many volunteer hours towards doing so). If not allowing altcoins is a deal-breaker to you, I'm not sure what to say, really. From my perspective, the mods here work tirelessly to balance allowing people free expression as much as possible... while also not hurting the production of a worthwhile Bitcoin subreddit that is free of spam, scams, redundancy, manipulation via external attacks from r\/btc, etc. I would know, since I am very much involved with the way moderation is conducted, and also mostly aware of what is happening in the rest of the ecosystem. I think the subreddit is run very well, although there are always ways to improve it further (altcoin promotion is not one of them, however).
Allowing altcoins is never going to happen, for the reasons given, so this is probably something you must accept &amp; agree to disagree upon. As I said, the developers themselves who make the protocol read the details of and discuss altcoin technology among themselves. Development is not divorced, and that's fine because they are educated enough to discern scams. Lay people cannot discern scams, and besides it's off-topic for r/bitcoin to be focused on altcoins, when there exists an enormous quantity of directly relevant bitcoin news to discuss. I devote myself almost entirely to bitcoin most days in my free time, and I literally have nowhere near enough time to cover all material.

This is a b.s. (politically correct?) remark, u/evoorhees, and it means nothing in this context. You need to stop looking at things so literally, and to such a degree that it becomes inaccurate -- because you look at trees instead of forest.
Obviously if the top-voted threads have titles that are lies/fabrications, then it means the majority of the sub has (implicitly) deemed that content worthy! The "subset" you speak of is the *majority*, which is all that really matters here. It's irrelevant if there is a subset of frequenters who are rational and care for truth/evidence, if the other 90% are single-agenda hateful hooligans, who gleefully ignore facts and disregard value of evidence and truth (which you can see for yourself that they *mostly* do, whenever u/nullc tries to explain something to them). To "collectivize" r/btc based on the majority (as evidenced by how they mass-upvote lies) is not some sort of stretch. (Btw, the moderators of are complicit in this deception, when they allow such lies to be posted &amp; forego any responsibility, under the guise of "uncensored sub" -- something which is not tolerated by but which you like to join Roger Ver in deceptively terming "censorship"... instead of what it is, which is "responsible moderation").
Also, as said, Erik Voorhees you're sort of behaving hypocritically. When you don't like something that affects you personally on r/bitcoin, you make a big social media hoopla about it. When lies are spread on a place like r/btc, you willfully look the other way and say not a single word. Actually, you say a word, and in this case it was only some nitpicking comment about "collectivizing" r/btc, even though clearly majority up-voted lies without care -- but, you don't seem to care to actually admit 's frequent habit of spreading lies, do you? You did not do so on Reddit, nor on your Twitter. You just turn a blind eye to it, and the next second you speak about r/bitcoin "censoring" this &amp; that (and continue to ignore, or rather you justify (like you did just now), how: 1) frequently upvotes outright lies to the top of their sub, and 2) the mods do nothing to change this, in fact giving their tacit approval for this behavior by refusing to take action due to their "uncensored sub").

I used those words intentionally. 'Bitcoin Core' = 90% of nodes, hence, practically speaking, 'Bitcoin Core' = 'Bitcoin'. The network follows Core's rules.
When Mike as a developer makes such explicit statements, it is unprofessional and harmful to bitcoin's reputation. If he cares about Bitcoin, he will not speak carelessly, and essentially insult all the developers who have reached consensus on making these decisions to deal with spam, just because he personally disagrees. His behavior is a sign of immaturity and callousness, as well as egomania and disregard for the other devs.

I'd like to know what you think is necessary for Bitcoin to become or for it to adopt in its protocol, in order to satisfy what you want. I'm genuinely curious. I agree that there is a "bigger picture", but I'm not sure what you're imagining. You're speaking a lot about what you don't want, but not much about what you do want.

u/pb1x, I agree with here, and his follow-on explanations.
Even if the original PDF cannot be changed, such that it is as if the original PDF did not exist (i.e. that the original PDF will always exist somewhere), the implication from cobra was unhelpful.
The 'original PDF' is a founding document of sorts. We can disagree (if there is area to disagree) with various parts of it, but it's another matter entirely (and very arrogant) to imagine changing that document ("updating" it), and then linking that "updated" document (on bitcoin.org, or anywhere) as an "updated white paper" (there will only ever be a single "bitcoin.pdf", it's famous  -- trying to change that initial "bitcoin.pdf" document is an act of deception).
On the other hand, if one wants to create a document that is clearly labeled as one's own creation (and clearly cite the original bitcoin.pdf 's content within), then that might be okay (e.g. "Cobra's revision of Bitcoin White Paper").
But in this case, cobra implied changing the bitcoin.pdf that is linked on bitcoin.org. It's also unwise, from the perspective that it creates huge cost (in drama) for virtually no gain (opposite of 'gain', rather: one can't revise Satoshi's paper &amp; call it an 'updated' white paper).
One could only 'update' the original "bitcoin.pdf", if Satoshi himself was part of such an 'updating' process, which cobra does not imply he understands, given he said: *"There are already a few different versions of the paper out there, so Satoshi has already set the precedent that the paper should be updated to reflect the current realities of the software"* &lt;-- in these "different versions", Satoshi was always the author, unless cobra is referring to something else.
If he only wanted to do the above, then he wouldn't have needed to ask for comments on his self-admitted *"divisive"* idea. He could just begin writing a revised version, label it as created by him, and that would be it. By suggesting such a document could replace the 'bitcoin.pdf' hosted at 'bitcoin.org' (cobra: *"I've been noticing that the Bitcoin paper at  is getting a lot of traffic"*), he takes things a step way too far.
Cobra has also explicitly clarified in a new comment, that our interpretation is what he means: *"Users will always be able to find the original paper anyway, just like people are still able to download very old versions of Bitcoin."*

The situation of Luke vs. Cobra are two different matters. Why conflate the two? Luke works on a contractual basis (instead of on a full-time basis). Cobra "has never worked for Blockstream". It can't get much clearer than this. -- It's not semantics at all; it's about facts. It's a fact that this "cobra" guy is the one who proposed this, NOT Blockstream or its employees.
The 'larger point' is a different matter altogether. Again, it was "cobra" (who co-owns bitcoin.org) suggesting it. And, they are not "pro censorship" -- Core created its bitcoincore.org site to become independent from Cobra's bitcoin.org site. The bitcoincore.org site retains its normal bitcoin.pdf link, and there was no discussion on changing that.

Having the word 'bitcoin' 13 times is irrelevant and meaningless; the title is "Why Ethereum is the hottest new thing in digital currency" -- and this is clearly an article pumping ethereum and implicitly saying bitcoin is now in the background. An article of this nature has zero relevance to a Bitcoin sub.
The purpose of the Forbes article is not to discuss Bitcoin; it's about the ETH DAO HF saga. If you read my original post, I already explained these HF posts are allowed only because some think it's helpful to allow it. Originally, they were disallowed, which is the whole reason Erik is complaining (actually he seems obsessed that the WSJ article specifically was not allowed, oddly enough). So yeah, it was allowed to permit closure on a topic that was heavily discussed previously on r/bitcoin, even though yes it has no direct relevance. It can be argued it is indirectly relevant though, as it shows Bitcoin importance of its careful development path and value of immutability, vis a vis Ethereum with its HF bailout of slock.it and DAO investors.

He is not a bitcoin pariah. I like and generally I think he is principled, but there are lots of faults IMO, too. That's not new; we all have faults. Specifically, in this case, he does have a conflict of interest with Shapeshift (altcoin exchange that takes 1-2% on every roundtrip trade). Thus, it is ethically immoral for him to speak about altcoin promotion on a bitcoin subreddit. Also, he has a habit of creating unnecessary drama over insignificant issues, and without having full information that is easily obtainable by directly conversing with mods (to get that info).

HaoBTC blog was not meant as an offensive post. HaoBTC is a friendly and professional pool. It was meant to clarify the status with certain Core devs regarding the situation with the Hong Kong meeting. It should have been done in private though, not public, and so that blog post was deleted to rectify that mistake.

Both short-term proposals (segwit SF and 2MB HF) will achieve a similar result, as far as capacity increase goes (~2x increase). Core wanting segwit SF to occur first is partly justified by how segwit fixes malleability, which is a necessary prerequisite for fully-functional LN.

Do you ever do anything but complain? Holy hell. I have paid heed to your posts for the last 2.5 years, and literally you spend most of your time whining and behaving like an ungrateful &amp; spoiled brat. Bitcoin is not in this world to make you rich. Got it? Devs don't work their asses off for your sole benefit. Lose your entitled manner. I recall you also have been a brainless XT/Classic supporter (brainless because you never seem to understand the tech developments, or know what's going on, or appreciate value of decentralization), and you've done your fair share of shitposting about Core on the other sub &amp; cheerleading behind the centralization-friendly airhead (Gavin)... the same Core, mind you, that makes up 95%+ of active Bitcoin developers *who do all the work developing the protocol that you are allegedly 'all-in' on*.

Yes, but I still think this is bad. The default will be changed (with a banner linking to the 'older' version). The issue is it's improper for one to revise another's work (Satoshi's bitcoin.pdf), and pass off the bitcoin.pdf v2 as still being 'bitcoin.pdf'. Satoshi authored the paper, and, without his consent, one can't create a new version of his paper (in effect, by changing the default paper link (/bitcoin.pdf), this is what will be done). This is not about "hysteria" or treating Satoshi like a "God" (obviously most of us, at least in this sub, are fully aware Satoshi is not a "God" and nor is his white paper a holy scripture), but it is about how academic papers work.

Yes, of course, agree :). The community is extremely important. Everything mods do here is to provide a quality experience for readers, and minimize spam, scam, trolling, pumping, etc.
When I said 'private' forum, I was meaning it in the sense that mods operate the forum, according to certain rules and guidelines, and with exceptions made at times according to discretion. Just because the community is important, does not make it any less privately-operated in the sense that mods have discretion how to operate the sub. Every subreddit is this way, unless there are no mods at all... which I don't think is possible on Reddit.
When Erik speaks with a sense of entitlement here, wishing to see altcoins promoted on a bitcoin subreddit and wondering why they are not, then in that context I am saying "mods make the rules here, and if he doesn't like it, he can go to a subreddit that is more aligned". Part of the irritation comes from his obvious conflict of interest as Shapeshift operator, and partly because it is a recurring pattern with Erik to have these public drama episodes. I think I wasted 2.5 hours of my time on this issue so far. -- it's absurd.

$1 or less items are considered micropayments, effectively. Such items are hardly commonplace. Second, 10-20% of $1 = 10-20 cents. Fees are nowhere near that high right now, e.g.   shows 5-cent fee right now for the fastest processing (5%).
But yes, if someone really needs to do lots of micropayments, then standard Bitcoin is a bad idea. As I said, ChangeTip is an alternative Bitcoin micropayment service. Or, if that's inadequate, then find something else until Thunder / Lightning is ready.
Systems have tradeoffs; that's life.

It's partly politics (as I will explain), and partly it refers to the Hong Kong meeting which decided on ~2MB hard-fork that will activate 1 year from now.
Back to the politics angle...
For the last 1.5 years, Gavin has promoted a large block size limit increase hard-fork (first he asked for 20MB, then 8MB, then 8MB and doubling every 2 yrs for 10 years, and now finally after testing showed his proposals would be harmful to the network -- he has finally decided to accept 2MB "only", which is a safer limit). Because of this, in much of the community's mind, the way to increase capacity is to "raise the block size limit via hard-fork". However, segwit can achieve the same via soft-fork (a soft-fork is safer than a hard-fork), and it also comes with many more benefits than the alternative 2MB hard-fork (segwit fixes malleability for example, which is helpful to allow Lightning to be more optimized). Because of the long debate though, a certain fraction of people continue to yell for a hard-fork, due to seeming inability to understand that segwit soft-fork is the superior path to follow.
