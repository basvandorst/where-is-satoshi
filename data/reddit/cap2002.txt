As I see it Gavin implemented a way of detecting whether a transaction is in a conflicted state. Wallets and exchanges can use this to detect  conflicted transaction and handle it, whereas before there wasn't a viable way of detecting this.
It's a straight forward solution that shouldn't take the exchanges very long to accommodate in their own systems.
It doesn't make the original issue go away, but for all practical purposes this will fly.

The doors were never the problem. Lack of utility and consumer value proposition is.
From a purely speculative point of view, the alt coins are much more volatile and can turn a much bigger payout (and loss), so speculators are looking that way.

It's all for show anyway. I doubt they will budge much taken into consideration the regulations that banks have to submit to. 
The final proposal might even be stricter as banks may also comment on the matter and harden the fate of bitcoin businesses even further in order to "even out" the regulatory environment between regular banks and bitcoin "banks".

I'll be that guy, but what audience are you going for exactly? It does look *nicer* than what the community is used to on the *desktop*, but it will in no way provide that critical "user interface moment" that bitcoin, among a lot of other things, sorely needs to go main stream.
It might excite some regular coinheads, but this is still way too advanced, complex and cluttered for Mr. and Mrs. Smith usage.
You'll be surprised at how dumbed down a user interface has to be in order to really work. Noone wants to deal with cryptic transaction overviews, addresses, seeds, QR codes, app pairings, etc.
It'll still be something like Circle that takes usability and ease of use to the next level with no hassles or baffled users. In 5 years we'll all be laughing at apps exactly like this. It'll be like having the newest version of Chrome and looking back at the old Lynx browser.

It's software, so just make it even more divisible. I'm confident a 51% majority would be able to agree on that.
Also; when we get sidechains even 1 satoshi could theoretically be pegged in and represent an entire new chain of transactions by, say, 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 "satoshicoins".

You can't merge them in the sense that all send and receive addresses show up in the same Bitcoin-qt client. But you can merge the coins by so:
* Create a new receiving address in qt
* Copy address and exit wallet
* Rename wallet.dat to wallet1.bak
* Copy other wallet.dt to same folder
* Open qt again
* Transfer remaining total to the address you copied
* Exit wallet
* Rename wallet.dat to wallet2.bak
* Rename wallet1.bak to wallet.dat
* Open qt again
In transaction history the remaining total from the other wallet is now in this wallet and awaits confirmations.
How's that?

The team can and will scramble to fix bugs very quickly. I have to say compared to other financial systems Bitcoin is doing quite well. There's numerous examples of systems having bugs, security holes and so on. Of course this is no excuse to relax but it is open source and very transparent thus making it very secure as there's a lot of sentiment to "hack" it as noone really can be held responsible.

You are missing the point. 6.5 cents let alone 25 cents is way too much for average people in many developing countries to spend on fees, which is a reason for the widespread use of mobile instead of credit cards and the like.
For M-PESA for instance, fees start at 3.4 cents. Deposits, registration and buying airtime are all free of charge.
On top of this, everything works on a feature phone with a modified SIM-card from Safaricom. No internet or smartphone required here. You don't even pay for texting when transacting.
Let's just say Bitcoin is facing challenges in this space. Probably not insurmountable, but as it stands right now, M-PESA is still king.

Still, the idea of instant private transaction are properties that would be quite nice to have in bitcoin. The fact that this is not presently possible on the protocol level and probably never will be is discouraging.
We are talking about core properties that many people originally thought bitcoin had, but turned out it really didn't. Quite far from it infact. Tumblers, mixers, coin joiners and so on is really just a hack to a real problem.
Personally, when I spend bitcoins I might as well be standing on the corner shouting to everyone how much I have in the wallet, where I spent it, where all my previous transactions went and what I bought. Not really something to desire for in what could have been real cash on the internet, unless you are the government.

It's still early days when it comes to adoption of Bitcoin as a payment method. 2014 is the year many believe this will change. It's comparable to asking how many used e-mail in 1992 as a company is considering sending out newsletters.
The target group for now is still small. But if you target marketing of your website, e.g. sponsoring this subreddit and other Bitcoin related sites, you are more likely to get Bitcoin holding customers and may even corner the market within your specific field of business.
If you don't want to hold bitcoins directly you can choose to make use of a Bitcoin payment processor to convert your renevue into dollars immediately. Services in the US such as BitPay and Coinbase offer this.

With a bit of luck this could potentially force Apple's hand to welcome Bitcoin wallets back into the store, albeit that is probably wishful thinking. In any case, all good efforts to sway Apple's stance on Bitcoin is welcome in my book.

I, for one, welcome your regulations. As a non-US citizen I want to thank you for making sure the jobs in the crypto currency space will now be further pushed outside the US.
I also want to thank you for your great push into accellerating the development of fully decentralized crypto currency wallets, exchanges, transmitters and other related services. After all, this is programmable money.
As a parting thought I will leave you with a link to the famous Red Flag laws. You are about to create the crypto currency equivalent.

To most people, including CEOs, that would probably just be a long wall of techno babble.
If you want to sell an idea to people don't start with the "what" or "how", but rather start with the "why". Why should the business adopt bitcoin? Then you can always bore with the technical details later.
You didn't state anything about the business, relations, economics or other relevant factors that seemingly could benefit from bitcoin, so it's hard to give you any advice while thinking your business.

Yes, if you have a way of relaying all transactions from every FireChat client in the network an exit node connected to the internet the transactions could eventually be broadcasted.
But the whole premise of the FireChat mest network is the absense of internet connections, so as long as the transactions are not confirmed it would be trivial to send double spent unconfirmed transactions inside the mesh network.

I was at a non-bitcoin meetup where a pornstar gone producer was speaking about her life and how the government is harressing her about different aspects of her business.
After the speech I asked her about bitcoin and if she would consider accepting it in her business. She was quite familiar with bitcoin and even owned some personally. But she said that she quite particular about keeping her business image spotless and in her mind it would potentially damage that image if she started dealing in bitcoins due to resistance from governments and so on. Even telling her that Naughty America, Met-Art and others accepting it didn't seem to budge her.
This may not be a general pattern but I do sympathize with her point of view. I wonder how much of a general issue this is.
@_date: 2014-04-09 20:39:23
No, read this:
It basically means you can create any sort of chain, experimental or otherwise and 2-way peg its value with Bitcoin and getting the benefits of merged mining, extreme innovation, network effects and so on. It also has a positive feedback loop for the Bitcoin network as the demand  for Bitcoin will rise, securing it further and people will see it for what it truly is; the leading crypto currency.
It more or less remove any incentive to create an alt coin, unless you are a pump'n'dumper out for a quick buck.

So meta. Even side chains might have their own side chains(possible?) which in turn could have their own side chains and run them in parallel for extremely high transaction rate efficiency.
Bitcoin truly will become the internet of money, a central nervous system of value and currencies spanning the entire solar system, optionally with each planet having their own side chain currency pegged to Bitcoin.
Mind boggling stuff ...
@_date: 2014-10-15 13:53:10
Yes. But often it's best just to stay out in cash and then get back into the game you know when things settle down.

Yes, the doors to bitcoin are fine as is. What is missing is any viable reason why a consumer would prefer bitcoin over credit cards. So far there are very few. Heck, even very few from the porn industry are jumping in as it would ruin their profitable subscription based model.
@_date: 2014-07-10 13:30:25
Even in the unlikely event something vastly better should pose a real threat to bitcoin, we'll just fork it and bootstrap the bitcoin blockchain to distribute shares of existing coin ownership. That would provide instant skin-in-the-game and motivation for a lot of coin holders. Or just make a sidechain when these are available.
@_date: 2014-01-17 22:07:30
Congrats! 
@_date: 2014-02-14 21:02:31
Seriously, it can be hard to stomach when the price dives. In Bitcoin never invest more than you can afford to lose but also remember money is only lost when you liquidate that loss.
I'm confident we'll go over 1,000 again this year and if you hang in there you will be able to get out scott free. Bitcoin is a volatile investment, but that factor has been ever diminishing since the beginning. There will be more bubbles down the road, but best thing to do is hold on and ride them out.
Please understand and investigate what Bitcoin really is, what is in the works, the ever expanding network and so on.
This is not some pump'n'dump stock. It's a revolutionary, disruptive innovation.

It's really crucial that Bitcoin continues to lead the way in development, innovation and market making in an ever expanding and distractive bubble of copy-paste pump'n'dump coins.

Even if they are implemented successfully in an altcoin, I have my doubts they'll make it into bitcoin while it's still attractive.

You can exchange Doge to Bitcoin on Cryptsy.com but they aren't worth much.
It's very hard to find places to buy bitcoins for PayPal or credit/debit cards because of possible risk of chargebacks.
If you are not willing to make a bank transfer I would suggest  and make a face to face transaction for cash.
Other ways of getting bitcoins is to sell stuff or work for bitcoins.
Do you have a wallet? Electrum is very beginner friendly. If you plan on keeping your coins longterm I suggest a paper wallet.

The problem with a lot of consumer NAS though is most of them don't seem to have sufficient RAM to run as a full node. I believe 2 GB ram is recommended but few have that. I could be wrong about minimum requirements. They also use a lot of different CPUs and OSes that needs custom build packages.
Make no mistake, I would love to see full node packages point'n'click ready to install on Synology, QNAP, WD and so on.

Asking in this forum will get you biased results leaning heavily towards any option that supports Bitcoin, so your poll will possibly not show results that is shared with the population in general.
I will list some of the advantages of Bitcoin and then you are more able to make a qualified decision.

* Immediate payment from anywhere in the world
* Virtually unbreakable security encryption
* Security from identity theft
* Zero chargebacks

He clearly didn't write down the password as  it, unfortunately, was optional. Had he been forced to write and verify he wouldn't have lost 3 bitcoins. It was his mistake but the software simply is not foolproof enough for the likes of him and that's very bad.

I have a feeling the next run-up is further away this time due to the damage caused by Mt. Gox. People tend to remember bad stories over good ones, especially involving money.
I'm a bit concerned that the first real bitcoin killer app also has yet to appear. There simply isn't enough everyday reason for average Joe to use bitcoin. Even when purchasing stuff all risk is on the buyer - that alone will keep people away. I do know all the arguments for using bitcoin, but they are mostly reasons noone worry about. If and when a killer app appears then the price would probably jump another order of magnitude.
@_date: 2014-10-01 12:34:23

From a buyer's perspective, how could it compete with all the web stores and online auctions out there right now? Why would you bother with all the hassle of purchasing bitcoins followed by the risks of volatility and security? There's an entire universe of shops, many with a very high level of customer service, to meet most demands online for everyday users without going through all that trouble.
As I see it, the main reason for using Open Bazaar would be to purchase illicit goods (drugs, CP, weapons, you-name-it) and for the purchase of those, bitcoin simply isn't anonymous enough. Any illicit activity is stored in the blockchain forever. I know stuff like VPN, Tor, DarkWallet (CoinJoin, Stealth addresses) and stuff like that can help enforce privacy, but by design, bitcoin is an open book, so you would probably exhange your bitcoins for a more anonymous altcoin before proceeding.
Open Bazaar might help bump up the usage and price of bitcoin a bit, but I think the overall result will be disapointing.
@_date: 2014-09-28 18:12:23
Yes, that is the excuse we keep telling outselves. Wall Street won't save bitcoin. Only savers and consumers can do that. Hell, bitcoin was supposed to be the anticrist of Wall Street and now we are clinging our hopes to an ETF and may or may not get approval. I can't even start to imagine the fit this community will throw if it doesn't get approved. Let alone the price. The irony.

It might be, although I have a strong feeling AI smarter than humans will soon figure out to make a currency that is much more effective, requires no human support, isn't prone to 51% attack and so on. It will right all the wrongs in Bitcoin.

There's definitely potential in remittance, yet still quite untapped and it's going to take time and efford to push established remitters aside. We might get there one day, but this is a service that requires a lot of international infrastructure before it's effective. It's also a matter of being top of mind, having ease of use and competitive prices.

I wonder how Coinkite's merchant terminals designed for busy customers (who don't have a Coinkite account) at cafés, restaurants and physical shops in general fit with the policy of them not recommending zero-confirmation transactions.
From the FAQ:


Sounds pretty close to a recommendation to me and a bit contradictory.
It's one thing to write a press release reassuring customers about your own situation in the matter, but a whole other to start plugging your company name on practices that are more or less mutually exclusive to the terminal market you want to enter.
Are you covering for your merchants in case they get frauded on zero-confirmation transactions involving transactions from non-Coinkite customers?

Vitalik and PayPal aside, as long as actors stays hidden perhaps even stockpiling coins the network and trust is perceived intact.
A nation state or a coalition of nation states could easily do this if they wanted to get a covert and very strong upper hand at the network.
When the timing is right all coins could flood the market causing panic and dispair for months and the kicker would be to abuse a coordinated 51%+ advantage grinding the network to a complete halt temporarily - enough to cause serious medium-to-long term harm and mistrust. Rinse and repeat.
Incentive? Protect the global trillion dollar money printing central banker scheme. In my mind this is a very real threat but seems to go generally unaddressed and arrogantly shrugged off as expensive and impractical.
If ever there was an issue to address and mitigate in the bitcoin space this would be it.

I'm not sure what the typical markup percentage is on LocalBitcoins, bitcoin ATMs or even Mycelium Local Trader, but 2.9% is not too bad considering the fact you get your coins instantly. Lots of people on this subreddit has asked how they can purchase coins instantly, now there's an answer if you want to pay a premium. For everything else there's bank transfers with verification processes and so on.
Funny story. Last year when I got into bitcoin I had to pay 9% on my purchases, but that didn't matter as the value of bitcoin itself rose more than that on a daily basis =)

Kinda. It's a known fact that vast amounts of gold exists both in the earth and in the seas. It's just getting increasingly difficult to mine, unless technological breakthroughs happen. Graphene looks quite interesting for "mining" seawater at some point.
But even before that, several existing mines today are purposefully inactive due to low prices in gold. If the gold price starts to pick up again, so does mining, which in turn should put a dampener on price movement.

@_date: 2014-09-09 18:16:18
Right. I'm also wondering how many potential investors are holding off from investing in bitcoin right now because there's a pretty good possibility of an ETF going on Nasdaq soonish relieving investors from bothering with wallets, signups and so on. That might also explain the semi-absence of buying pressure.

Before anyone starts to panic maybe it should be added that by default JSON-RPC is not enabled, does not have SSL on by default and does not allow connections from outside the computer so this bug shouldn't affect ordinary users of the Bitcoin-qt/Core wallet.

You can compare it to when traditional currencies (side chains) were backed by gold (the Bitcoin blockchain).
Gold brings the scarcity making the currencies worth something because of high demand for gold.
Only in the example with Bitcoin and side chains ... it's on steroids and have unfathomable implications. It truely promotes Bitcoin to a protocol on which other types of currencies, securities, properties, etc. are pegged in value.

1 "bitcoin" is already a psychological trick. It's 100,000,000 satoshis but in the early days when thousands of bitcoins were involved in single transactions on a daily basis, e.g. for buying pizzas, it would be impractical and psychologically way overvalued to pay 1,000,000,000,000 satoshis for two pizzas. Even 10,000 btc seemed like much for two pizzas. The protocol actually deals in satoshis internally with int64 in the source code.
Considering that 1 bit is 100 satoshis, like 1 dollar is 100 cents, the denomination in bits makes a lot more sense than 1 bitcoin is 100,000,000 satoshis given the currently high dollar value.
Even in regular fiat currency schemes the denomination is changed whenever the currency has lost too much value due to inflation.

So many mixed emotions about this post and I'm probably going to sound like a douche for not understanding and not having a heart, but here goes.
First off, sorry for the loss. Really.
I'm put off by your headline about telling to give some charity, run by a lady not capable of handling security, their money back. This is outright begging for a cause that you just announced can't be trusted with money. Can Sean's Outpost be trusted with money?
Also, why couldn't Fr33 Aid announce this themselves? They are clearly capable of making a Reddit account so why not post the news?
Instead you decide to announce it in the name and good will of Sean's Outpost so you know the news would have a real chance of blowing up on the frontpage of and the media. This could easily blow back on a lot of people and other charities. Good job.
Now, tell me I'm an idiot, that Bitcoin should show more charitable spirit, that Bitcoin still feeds people and all that.
Sorry, my donations go elsewhere.

The 10 minute blocktime is set to ensure a high level of network propagation across the entire world. Faster blocks are at higher risk of being orphaned and thus not propagated sufficiently. It's no coincidence or a bad decision. It's by design. Some day it might become faster while still ensuring a high propagation level through advancements in the protocol.

Excerpt from the report:


experiment. Bitcoin is a crypto currency, the main and original attraction of which 7
is the low transactions cost associated with its use. One can buy Bitcoin the way 
one can buy euros and trade freely with others having euros. Trouble started when 
people began speculating that the value of Bitcoin would rise, thereby raising the 
demand for Bitcoin and making the value-rise a self-fulfilling prophesy. In other 
words, what we witnessed recently in the Bitcoin phenomenon fits the standard 
definition of a speculative bubble. 


there is little to learn by treating it as such. The main value of Bitcoin may, in 
retrospect, turn out to be the lessons it offers to central banks on the prospects of 
electronic currency, and on how to enhance efficiency and cut transactions cost.

It's different in that the bitcoin blockchain is a ~22 GB ledger containing all transactions since the genesis block, which is verified and  broadcast by full nodes and confirmed by miners.
Signing and broadcasting transactions through FireChat to your peers in an isolated mesh network will not affect the bitcoin ledger unless these transactions are eventually broadcast to the internet, so you will at best end up with unconfirmed transactions.

Store of value? Ask anyone who bought and held higher than, currently $382 and falling, if bitcoin was a store of value. To most but early adopters even argentinian pesos look attractive compared. I'm usually one of bitcoins big proponents but I am able to spot the flaws too. Anything else is downright denial.
It's evident the bitcoin network currently is being promoted as a payment system not least by companies like BitPay, Gyft, PayPal and so on. I suspect most people spending bitcoins are existing holders who want to cash out. Adoption has flatlined on most metrics.
To add injury to insult it's not that hard to start an altcoin and have moderate success. Where does that leave bitcoin? Heck, even PayPal will soon accept Dogecoin and Litecoin through GoCoin. It might look different in 5 years but right now, who in their right mind, besides ideological libertarians, would get involved with bitcoin aside from the its future speculative value.

I'm sorry for your downvotes. People clearly are missing the "to market" part.
With the price drop, weak miners are shutting down and the strong ones don't have to sell all in the cut throat business of mining and ever increasing difficulty.

They more or less have to because most coins would've been mined in 2015 and with that no more miner incentive to keep going. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 19:28:57
I was honestly expecting them to reveal the approval of the ETF at that conference. So much talk and nothing to show for. Would have been the perfect bull run together with news of the Coinbase exchange.

We'll see when Bitstamp is back online.
I suspect sell-offs. This was a close call and people will stampede out of bitcoin and onto greener pastures, probably helped a great deal by bear whales who will feast from this panic.

A really low barrier approach is to use Bitcore - an open source library making it easy to create wallets, transactions and so on using nothing but JavaScript so all you need really is a browser and a text editor.

This application is actually quite fitting for bitcoin. I can even see it working on a global scale bringing corrupt cops to fair justice.

How is Factoid that better than making a transaction to a hash of the data used to make a "brain wallet" and send a few real bitcoin bits through for mathematical proof?
I'd rather support real bitcoin than some leachy master/color/counter pump coin or alt coin.

It would be better if they would just shut the fuck up and let the ETF take its course.

Heat the room? Conversation starters? Nothing more really.
@_date: 2015-01-05 19:20:54
Would a hash of a high res picture randomly taken outside (not entirely flat and single colored) be random enough?

Mining on PCs will not get you any bitcoins anymore because competition has become too steep due to specialized hardware. It would be a pure waste of power.

This is all just to make sure you write down the password on a note as otherwise these rules are very hard to remember. Who the hell sets such a low upper length password anyway?

Don't be so sure. If the Winkelwii have over 100,000 btc in holdings that has to be "sold off" first. Then after that they might have made agreements with all sorts of miners and dark pools for coin supply. So there might not be any immediate price reaction. Long term though it's a pretty safe bet.

TL;DR Conclusion:




@_date: 2015-08-07 17:30:55
I'm buying Ether at the moment.
Bitcoin had promise but it's stagnating or even shrinking in interest. There just isn't a mainstream use case. The risk is all on the consumer. Even Greece couldn't make it go to the moon.
There is too much bickering among devs and the vision and the idea seems lost. It still has a chance of a comeback but who's gonna wait when there's a new and sexier blockchain ready for the big time?
Now go downvote while circlejerking.

Actually the layoffs are closer to 18,000 of which 5,500 are not Nokia-related.
Either way this signals some very bad business decisions were made. So now they are scrambling to reshape and stay relevant, which is risky but probably the right strategy. They haven't been disruptive in any significant areas for the last decade. Always panting in the catch-up game, perhaps with noble exceptions of their development tools.
I will be very surprised if they manage to regain any significant relevance, and not let their lucrative cash cow, business apps, slip away at the same time. The Microsoft haydays of the 90s and the 00s are gone.

So a centralized company, e.g. Coinbase, won't deal with bitcoins related to drugs, gambling, etcz. That's their loss. I'm pretty sure they, theoretically, don't want to deal with Darkcoins either without knowing the origins.
So much for Darkcoin fungibility then?
The blockchain doesn't discriminate. Centralized actors do.

The fact that it's even possible to do surveillance is an issue you should address to the core developers.
The fact that it's affecting SPV clients is an issue for the SPV clients. They are not full node wallets and aren't contributing to the distributed ledger either. This was not how Satoshi designed it.

I appreciate the effort by Mycelium, but I doubt users in general will use salt as it's an expert feature.
Also it just prevents from tampering with the key itself. As soon as the device is plugged in, information may trivially be transferred to and from the device, compromising the host. USB has been proven broken and largely unfixed. Most modern printers will leave an invisible mark on print outs establishing further trace.
Any way you look at it with this device you are sacrificing some amount of security and privacy in exchange of some convenience. I hope they make that very clear in the product disclaimer.
My advice would be to use diceware and an old fashion pen and paper.

You got me. No checksum is collision free. 
I'll have to go with reasonable doubt and hope the counterparty can't present a collision matching the exact formula of how the private key was generated in the first place.

I see is leaking again and this comment will be in vain proving you wrong as you clearly have an agenda.
Nevertheless, I'll post this article for all to study as it intuitively proves the math behind public/private key pairs - which can easily be generated from a SHA checksum of a digital asset and of which the proof is trivially broadcasted to the blockchain for immutable verification.
Even if I was the only person left with a copy of the blockchain, the math and proof of digital ownership could still be verified.

~~Buy and hold strategy of bitcoins in the market at the time of ordering would have been worth approx. $56,700 by now. That amount would take 2,034 days (5.5 years) to mine at todays price rate by the posted mint speed. To add, the difficulty rate has gone hyperbolic so there's hardly any chance at all to achieve that in 5.5 years. Most likely that box will be worthless in a few weeks. Fact.~~

I like the idea of cold storage, but how do you prevent the wallet from falling into the wrong hands? I don't perceive a safety box as being safe at all. It's an illusion to me. I have thought about splitting the wallet using Shamir' Shared Secret but maybe there are other methods?

I wonder if this is just some marketing trick.  They might set it at 0%, but they still get to decide their XBT buy and sell price.
I believe Western Union has used such a model at some point: no fee added, but a huge spread instead, say 20%.
They could also be playing the "loss leader" strategy for a while to grow their client database, maybe even canibalizing on what is still a very nascent XBT payments market trying to wipe out other players like BitPay and BIPS.
You gotta wonder.
@_date: 2013-07-10 22:25:23
Why don't you just make a buy order at the price that you were willing to pay? Given the volatility of Bitcoin, I'm convinced it'll dip and rise several times in the future.

Hmm.. They might not help with a gun to your head. But as a general rule you should only keep as much in one wallet as you can afford to lose. If your main savings are secured by a Trezor hidden away or split in cold storage by n-of-m, it's more difficult.
You could use a hidden partition on a TrueCrypt partition to claim plauseble deniability.
Otherwise some of  the other answers in the thread are good too. Like nLockTime.

They should just call it YetAnotherExchange - and being right in the middle of overregulated USA the odds of success are slim. The volume leading exchanges are all outside the US with good reason.

There are multiple independent core developer who are contributing to the project, everything is open source and very closely peer reviewed and will not be accepted by the network if problems are identified.

Additionally gold is subject to counterfeiting by using tungsten as filler, and gold's fineness can be diluted using other materials, e.g. silver and bronze.
If the environment is of a concern, gold mining and production is also orders of magnitudes more taxing on the environment. The Bitcoin network runs on electricity that can easily be retrieved from a sustainable energy source.

Not a bad suggestion. I recently dropped Electrum though. It acted really weird on me, didn't show the right transactions, had to delete local wallet and (thank god) retrieve it again from the network. I'm done with Electrum.
I'm thinking more in the ways of a physical media in a vault somewhere with the wallet and having the wallet encrypted with several layers where a unique person has each password to the first stage, second stage and so fort. One password could be in the will or in the hands of the lawyer, another key by well.. maybe in a bank vault somewhere. You get the idea. It's quite a quest to get the wallet, but that's the idea right?

If you have enough invested in bitcoins and you want diversification, why do you want to go into a bitcoin-related stock? In my book that's not diversification, it's just another exposure to bitcoin. You'll want to go into gold, silver, real estate, stocks in various sectors and countries, etc. That's diversification.

You can consider a bitcoin as an asset, a property. In a way you can compare this with the period (year 2000-ish) where every good internet domain name was up for grabs. In a near future people will be dealing in satoshis - currently the smallest unit of the bitcoin because a single bitcoin itself will be worth more than a boullion gold bar because, like good internet domain names, they will become very  very scarce, thus very valuable. 
@_date: 2013-04-01 16:04:07
Well if Bitcoin could keep the Fed and ECB in check that would be a noble achievement but that's pure utopia as the central banks are driven in part by political emotions and at an attempt to stay popular with the voters. I'll stick with Bitcoin, thanks!

There's your problem. Too many assumptions and prerequisites. If Bitcoin if to succeed as a substitute for PayPal et al, then stability and trust has to be established. Right now both are pretty far away in my opinion.
A merchant has to be able to work with a no-brainer, trustworthy, stable and automated turnkey solution where money end up in the fiat account instantly with no risk. Any other scenario is illusional.

The problem is the constant high difficulty increase which demands that people keep throwing money into mining, of which they may never see a profit. So it's a risky proposition with little guarantee of any meaningful return compared to just investing in bitcoins. It can spur into a negative feedback loop, but I hope we'll see an equilibrium at some point where it's profitable and not just in the hands of a few. 
Only time will tell.

I'm pretty sure the day traders and the whales will play their part to induce further panic into the market, so we are going to see a lot of ups and downs in the weeks ahead. Exactly like the crash back in april. It's an opportunity few speculators are gonna miss.
@_date: 2013-03-13 12:34:39
Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the more transactions going on, the more ~~miners~~ nay, *transaction confirmers* are needed in the network to keep the confirmation time to a minimum. The transactions with the largest submitted fee amounts gets priority in the blocks, and then the rest is served.
If you don't add any fee, there's a chance it could take a long time before verification.
I believe it's designed this way to give *transaction confirmers* a sentiment to partake in the network.
@_date: 2013-05-21 23:19:08
Or they put the money in litecoin and so on.
@_date: 2013-03-19 21:49:16
Hmm, yes.
Maybe it's time to start yet another subreddit on Bitcoin, this time related to economics and news that will have relevant impact.
Then this subreddit can remain stuck in questions such as:
* Where do I buy bitcoins for drugs on SilkRoad?
* Can I mine with my intel i486 CPU?
* I lost teh wallet, can I has coinz?
* I'm gonna pump'n'dump the market in 5 minuttes, AMA, suckers.

I would imagine that a lot of  trust in the coin from merchants has vanished at this point.
As it stands now selling your merchandise in bitcoins is sort of like betting your income at the casino.
It's all fun and giggles when the price goes up, because they'll just offer 10% discount or whatever to give sentiment to spending that deflating coin.
But what happens when the price plummet from the sky? How will you then pay the rent at the end of the month and pay your creditors who still will want to receive fiat currency.
I believe Bitcoin has a future, but this is quite a setback in the trust from merchants that could take a long while to reestablish.

It's a misconception that Bitcoin is anonymous - it's pseudo anonymous meaning that if you can correlate any personal data, e.g. email address, bank account, IP address, GPS coordinates, usage logs, and other electronic footprints, to a specific bitcoin address that you happened to use for illicit purposes, then the trace is more or less irreversible.

The mining difficulty rate is very unpredictable and rising sharply at the moment. The mining business is not for everyone anymore. That video you linked is quite old and a lot has happened since then.
Compare it to back in past where you could literally pick up a big nugget of gold from the ground because no one else had seen the idea of gold yet.

How does Gyft help promote Bitcoin on the retailer side? To me it seems they are just accepting a normal gift card completely oblivious to the fact that it may have been paid for in bitcoins. Exactly how does that benefit the Bitcoin network and strenghen the currency? To me that just strenghtens the Gyft bottom line - please convince me I'm wrong.
I get that you are running a business and I see you have made yourself successful at providing a service to a niche group with money to spend but few places to go. However the Bitcoin community is making itself fragile by depending on Gyft and the likes as intermediaries. Let's for instance entertain for the moment the idea that you decided to accept an alt-coin instead of or in addition to Bitcoin. That would weaken the Bitcoin network in one blow whereas if the retailers accepted bitcoins directly that would be a lot more rebust for the brand and not exposed to the will and plans of other intermediaries as being an almost single point of failure.
As for BitPay (perhaps Coinbase too?), they offer a product that actually promotes Bitcoin and their service is capable of automatically selling off a set percentage of the total amount to fiat and keeping the rest in bitcoins. Does Gyft offer that kind of automatic fractional hedging for the retailer?
I respect that you seemingly want to promote Bitcoin to businesses by your post, but I'm concerned that your own business model is becoming a part of the problem and not the solution. But again, please convince me I'm wrong.

Eventually Poland will run up its debt even more and I'm confident they will then confiscate those ~~stolen~~ nationalized funds. The message alone of this action should raise a lot of concern just as the whole Cyprus ordeal did.
The article is not directly linked to anything Bitcoin - but I'm pretty sure that some of the run up in price that we saw back in march and april was due to what was going on in Cyprus. It was too late for the Cypriots, but the Spanish took great notice.

A scarce asset getting even more scarce due to increasing demand, all else equal, will always push price upwards.
One example is land, which like Bitcoin, is almost infinitely divisible. 
Over time, as Manhattan and Hong Kong, small finite areas (scarce), became more and more populated (demand), the price of land went up. However, that did not stop people from selling and buying land in those areas, it just set the price higher. A lot higher.

I can't say what sort of price development there's going to be short term. It's very volatile thus the price jumps up and down. If you are in Bitcoin to make a quick buck, good luck to you.
However what I do know is over half the total number of bitcoins to ever exist have already been generated thus the next two halving days will make bitcoins much much more scarce. People will also turn to actually buying and holding bitcoins again instead of buying ASICs as they become less and less profitable due to rising difficulty. At the same time there's an ongoing upgrade of the entire Bitcoin-network with start-ups all over the place, VC money flowing in, more and more interest in how to buy, attending conferences and a lot more adaption to Bitcoin on the web in general.
The future of Bitcoin looks very very bright.

You can't use the global money supply as a factor. In reality it'a supply and demand that sets the price. Just look at the current development of price. The market cap is over one billion and one month ago it was maybe 300 mill. Noone put 700 mill in the market in that period. The price was set by supply and demand. This of course means the $5 mill/coin could well prove to be a very conservative guesstimate taking the above into consideration. How about that?

Someone please fill me in here as my knowledge in these matters is superficial. But  from my understanding if you have a completely isolated network the difficulty adapts so the remaining mining notes is guaranteed to confirm transaction on the fork. Once the network is reconnected to the world this entire fork of transactions is invalid and everything is back the way it were before the disconnect happened. If the internet in Syria dies completely then that issue shouldn't be a problem. Spending coins will be though.

Given the choice between the lead and the runner-up, I prefer someone who has a proven interest in Bitcoin, is in touch with the community and one who is not about to sacrifice Bitcoin on the altar of regulations without a fight. He has also proven himself an excellent and eloquent spokesperson in the media on several occasions. All are properties I value a lot and can relate to.

It is believed that the earth's mantle contains enough gold to cover a 4 meter thick layer around the globe. Finding it and mining it however is a different matter.
Source: 
Also, one of the new wonder materials of the 21th centry, graphene, has proven perfect for desalination of water. In that regard some estimate that up to 15,000 tons of gold exist in the oceans. Admitted, there is a lot of water to filter to capture all that gold, but never the less, it's a big untapped source of gold just waiting.

So I wouldn't really consider gold scarce in the bigger picture, maybe just difficult to get at. But so is Bitcoin! :)

I'm not sure and can't answer for the bitcoin exchanges, but my take on it is that those big financial data feed providers (Bloomberg, Reuters, etc.) simply isn't on the radar for them just yet.

How is $46 a far cry from $50? Looking at the general trend, the Bitcoin value has been growing with a steady 2% EACH DAY on average for the last year, suggesting it will be at and maybe even passed $50 by the end of next week. If wealthy- and institutional investors get access to bitcoins through a hedge fund, the price is going through the roof. Until now it's mainly been small timers getting into Bitcoin. The best is yet to come.

All in all a pretty good article and interesting views from The Bitcoin Foundation. However, I think Miss Mahdawi has it a bit wrong. No one shut down Mt. Gox. HSI shut down a shell company in the US that transmits funds from Dwolla to Mt. Gox. We don't need the The Bitcoin Foundation spreading FUD, so I hope she'll get her facts straight soon enough.

I don't believe the rich are affected much from inflation. At least they have a choice not to. They are well advised on how to hedge or have someone do it for them. They own land, real estate, art, precious metals, intellectual copyrights and a lot of other inflationsafe, scarce assets. 
Inflation is affecting the middle class and the poor a lot more. Many live paycheck to paycheck with the perpetual need for a raise in order to keep up with rising costs. Inflation is a hidden tax on people who don't have means and knowledge about hedging.

If only it was that easy. But as we've read stories about, companies have had their bank accounts seized or cancelled with little or no notice by more or less just mentioning the word Bitcoin.
It's really absurd hostility coming from the banks, and I can understand vendors and retailers don't wanna take this leap blindfolded and jump off a cliff economically. It would potentially spell disaster for their business.
Rest assured momentum is gaining and the pressure is building, so in due time something's gotta give. Patience young grasshopper.

Oh! I forgot to mention the interesting part.
When Bitcoin's appreciation has peeked sometime in the future, you don't even need to sell them to make a very profitable income. The banks and everyone else will be dying to borrow, so you will be making money on the accumulated interest alone.
Of course in return for lending, you just require that they pose collateral value such as real estate, land, etc. So even in the case of a lost loan, you still have value.
How's that for a win-win?

The fees are in the system to give sentiment to confirmers to go out and invest in gear to be part of the confirmation network and the revenue that follows. As they say; money makes the world go around.
In the future Bitcoin should be worth so much in value that even a fraction of Bitcoin fees is enough for the confirmers to stay in business.
The difficulty factor is dynamic, so it will go up and down depending on how many confirmers are in the network. So if a lot of confirmers for some reason quit, the difficulty will come down again and thus making it an interesting option for, say, CPU/GPU miners again. Personally I don't think this will ever happen with the rate Bitcoin is growing.
I'm no expert on Bitcon. All of this information is what I've picked up myself during the last month or so through articles, blogs, etc. I'm sure other redditors on can fill you in with more details regarding the workings of Bitcon.

I would argue that the fees are much, much lower than any fee from the competing payment providers; Visa/MasterCard, PayPal, Western Union, etc. But take a moment to study the findings regarding Bitcoin fees and competing providers.

@_date: 2013-07-13 15:33:37
As long as the invoice issuer's default currency is dollars, I'm pretty sure he'll want a dollar equivalent amount minus the 10% discount if the customer is paying in ~~BTC~~ XBT, no more, no less. After all, he most likely have "real world" expenses that are denominated in dollars.
This is one of the reasons why BitPay is so popular. They eliminate price lag, volatility and exchange rate differences.

Ban exchanges? And how would you introduce a ban and uphold it in every country across the world? Heck, we even have ATMs coming, where you put your money in and get bitcoin, thus no need for central exchanges. It's all decentralized.
Don't be naive - this thing can't be swept under the rug with legislation, the genie is out of the bottle. Same with 3D printers and guns.
It won't hold value for only black/grey market and virtual offshore accounts. It might start that way, but we are already way beyond. Today companies offers employees salaries in bitcoin. A french bank is backing the bitcoin. Bitcoin is needed as a payment standard in countries such as Greece, Zimbabwe, etc.
In general this phenomenon can't be stopped and Bitcoin seems to be the winner that will go everywhere.

Dogecoin is exactly what the crypto currency community needs. A coin that's not taking itself too seriously and has a cute dog as mascot and a meme with large amounts of stuff  to look at. That has appeal to quite a bit of people who thinks the Bitcoin community is taking all this "magic internet money" a bit too seriously.

In a true apocalyptic scenario the only viable currencies will be food, ammunition and medical drugs. Gold or silver would be further down the list.
There's no clear way Bitcoin could survive in a true offline scenario as double spends would not be easily discovered and it would be nothing more than yet another fiat currency with big risks of counterfitting. I would like to be proven wrong though.

Money probably won't be around in 50 years time.
By then the human civilization, or a distant image of it, will likely have reached the technological singularity, maybe through a hard take off assisted by hard core AI, and stuff will be abundant through molecular nanotechnology or maybe we'll have been uploaded to an equivalent of a civilization simulator and seized to exist in the physical form all together.
Money really is just an ancient artifact that our civilization needs to rid of through rapid evolution.

What is cool about Dogecoin is the price ratio to BTC is so low, it actually makes sense to denominate the price in satoshis, like the price of one DOGE is 160 satoshis.
If people start talking more about the price of DOGE in satoshis, a lot more people will start to become familiar with satoshis, and let's face it, that's how everyone really wants to denominate Bitcoin. In the end I believe Dogecoin will do a lot more for Bitcoin than alt coins like Litecoin and Quark ever have.

Not trolling at all.
If you think that customer needs translate to complaints, your success will be stillborn. In business it's called "supply and demand" and since your order book is virtually empty you might want to get familiar with that term.
Seeing you are the CEO of Kraken and likes to get down and dirty in the subreddit I would advice you take a class on business management, customer communications or the very least hire professional PR advice before you get yourself into a social media mess that will stick to Kraken for a time to come - or do you just want to "keep it real" and *[wwebsite as on the internet](
Your attitude representing a company that supposedly will handle peoples money and values in millions of dollars leaves much to be desired. I can only imagine how quick the squid would get fried if you some day make it "Mt Gox"-big, your business start having similiar issues and you start throw punches left and right.

Okay, maybe not immediately ban it outright, but ... evaluate it and take necessary measures.
From the Parlament-site:
From Google Translate:
Assess the risks of online currency Bitcoin
Text filed
The Federal Council presented a report on the risks of online currency "Bitcoin", particularly with regard to its use for the purpose of money laundering and financing of criminal activities, or its legality in light of the prohibition of "game of the aircraft" or "Ponzi scheme." It will assess the measures taken or envisaged to other states to regulate this market.
Virtual currency "Bitcoin" is experiencing a meteoric also its price is volatile success. Primarily designed for online transaction, it seems gradually gain "real" economy in some countries. It seems that private money is used extensively for the purpose of money laundering and financing of criminal activities. In addition, the system can put it on the market seems to some observers, is likened to a "game of the plane" or a "Ponzi scheme" illegal system that allows first entered a market enrich themselves at the expense of newcomers, which will arrive more quickly to find buyers. Many countries see a great danger to the stability and integrity of the financial system and are considering regulating markets "Bitcoin" or outright ban the use of this virtual currency.
Because of the importance of the financial center, it seems appropriate to evaluate the impact and risks of "Bitcoin" to our country, to check its compatibility with the laws that govern our financial sector, and, if applicable to take the necessary measures.

Basically, it's computers monitoring all the Bitcoin exchanges in the world for price development, and by quickly buying low from the cheapest exchanges and selling to the highest bidding exchange that will even out the markets by supply and demand mechanics and making a quick buck in doing so.

Cool idea. You just need to add the One Hundred Trillion Dollar bill to your product range.

You should add support for customers submitting their own BIP 38 encrypted wallet private key and public address to you. That would make it a more trustworthy product.

Also; if you should get mentally impaired or worse, it's not possible to pass on the coins to next of kin unless you somehow disclosed the phrase, which itself is a breach of the security.
Regarding the technical aspect; I can easily imagine malicious scripts or even hardware keyloggers snagging up that pass phrase and voila; they have your wallet. Pass phrase collisions also exist and there's been posts on here about them where people had chosen poor pass phrases. They can also be dictionary hacked if too simple. Google for more info. Personally I would never use a brainwallet for much else besides a spending wallet with small amounts.

My wife trust me in money matters. For me Bitcoin could very well be the future money protocol of the internet and we are long on this investment. Ideally we'll never have to exchange back to fiat as the internet and to some degree the real world adopts it. So far it's proven itself a winner and it has huge potential. Of course there's also risks lurking in the waters, but same is the case for any other storage mean of money.

Just holding those 433.34 coins until todays value @ $135 in a wallet would now have a value of $58,500, so even after you've mined 30.35 coins ($4097 and not accounting for the electricity bill), you basically threw away $43,097 so far. Granted, you will probably mine a few more coins before the difficulty rate makes it pointless.
Personally I would auction those ASICs off on eBay and put the money back into bitcoins as fast as possible and possibly ASICMiner shares if being invested in mining was a goal.

I think the bot is a great idea if it was a lot cheaper. I would even be willing to make a bitcoin reclaimable deposit if this is needed to fend off spam. But as things are now I don't really understand why Reddit allows these kind of initiatives. It compares to a parasite feeding off the narwal that we all love.

I just heard the interview that you managed very well and I strongly agreed on all points and hold you in high esteem. Stumbling upon this comment and realizing it's the "real" Eric Voorhees participating in a mud slinging comment contest frankly disappoints me.
Your comment is very far from how I heard you managed yourself on the show and I'm convinced you wouldn't've answered like that to a caller on the Peter Schiff-show.
You need to take a breath and don't get emotional about comments on Reddit. As I'm sure you're well aware of, SatoshiDice is a very hot topic both here and on Bitcointalk at the moment in regards to the blockchain issue, and if you love Bitcoin which I know you do, I beg you to see the greater picture and act accordingly.
I'm writing this comment in the greatest respect and trust you won't perceive it as a berating. I love Bitcoin as much as anyone who's seen its bright, bright future in the crystal ball. Cheers!

Study how fiat currencies have crashed over time. Look what happened to the german reichmark or the zimbabwan dollar. Hyperinflation happened. Just like it's starting to happen for the US dollar by Greenspan's and Bernanke's hands. Wonder why gas is expensive in the US? Why the minimum wage is getting a raise? Why China hoards gold? The dollar is steadily decreasing in value, that's why. Wake up!
Bitcoin is ready for people around the world who realize their money's purchasing power is deminishing at an accellerating rate and that the inflationary spiral can't continue forever. Bitcoin may still be small but it's gaining more and more mass day by day. In a not too distant future it may very well have gained enough mass to turn the power table against inflationary, fiat currencies. They are already crashing against it so far.
If you are convinced the dollar will win over Bitcoin, please show me proof of your shorting position. I mean, you would win big if you had any guts to put your skin in the game. Otherwise I suggest you find another subreddit to troll with empty talk.

Staying still would be great to regain trust from the merchants. The media attention blew it up too quickly honestly.

Change is relative and in this context 10% is nothing when looking at the trend. It's merely a few days set back at best. If Bitcoin lost 90% or more of its value over night, then you can talk about a far cry from $50.

In all fairness it's kind of easy to get a high market cap with an existing amount of ~247 million Quark coins. Whether there's sustainable volume and a liquid market is another matter and is yet to be seen.
I like some of the properties of Quark Coin and to me offers a more interesting alternative than Litecoin. For now though, it's extremely speculative and the recent rise in value is mostly Bill Still's work. However I do look forward to a bit of promotion by Max Keiser and getting a Chinese exchange or two to accept it. That should prove really interesting in the alt-coin war.

I feel the same. I was a young adult in '94 and got my first dial-up and e-mail back then. I knew the internet was going to be big. Really big. I remember when I heard on the radio that the internet now had 35.000.000 users. I was mind blown and wanted to play a part in it. Today my life and career is very much dependent on the internet.
I'm getting the same feeling about bitcoins now. It brings a lot of opportunities and possibilities to the table that we can't really fully comprehend yet. There will be ups and down, but I can really see this thing taking off big time.

Now would be a very good time for a backup of your wallet file in case you haven't gotten any already. And remember, one backup is no backup, two backups is one backup and so on. You can't be too safe really. Just make sure the wallet is protected by a strong password.

The banks are like dinosaurs gazing at the blazing Bitcoin-meteor in the sky. They will most likely not be able to react before it's too late as they can't achieve majority consensus on their own ideas in due time. Bitcoin, 4 years old, is gaining momentum week by week and it will be very disruptive for their business.


Besides the simple money transfer aspect, it has a distributed trust system, contracts, bond, escrow, etc. Most important of all by being the internet of money it is programmable and will support stuff like autonomous agents, self-enhancing AIs and a whole range of other ideas just waiting to be implemented. The banks will never be able to match all this - it is simply against their own business model.

Comes as no surprise though. A lot of people would like to see the price come way down, burst the "bubble" or whatever and will spread as much FUD as possible when the timing is right.
It doesn't help the matter that the FUD was additionally fueled by a couple of big US news media. The rest of the world is not used to the bullshit dribble and fear mongering main stream media in the US is spewing out on a daily basis. I suppose a lot of US citizens could have inherited this unfortunate culture of communication.

I'm no professor in money psychology and the perceived denomination effect, but personally I would find it a lot more fun to be able to buy $1 worth and get approx. 518134 satoshis instead of a measly 0.00518134 BTC. That also immediately removes the popular misconception that you can't buy less that 1 BTC, and thinking it's too expensive.

He would need to go to the bank on a frequent basis and get it converted into something more stable or pay expenses in that country in that currency. I suppose the operator could add a percentage on the bitcoin price to mitigate some of the immediate inflation risk he's taking.

I agree. For a long time, Bitcoin has been serious business, which is all good. Money needs to be taken very serious.
However, Dogecoin is in a whole other category with regards to the approach on crypto currencies. It's new, it's "a joke", it's a meme, it's got a mascot, a ton of web sites and creative videos, arts and so on. It just dawned on me, that Dogecoin might have an appeal towards the female crowd that Bitcoin so far is still missing.
Mother of god .. Dogecoin may just thaw up the other 50% of the worlds population to crypto currencies. Much wow.

I think I'm just calling it as it is. Not trying to manipulate markets or anything. I'm actually a bit disillusioned about Bitcoin. Right now Bitcoin is more like a casino than a future internet currency. Heck, screw SatoshiDice - this is the real gamble. It's really sad, but it's quite insane how it's treated at the moment. Hopefully the dust settles and we can get back to a normal price growth and stability.

This is also a big concern of mine. I simply don't see the current state of services, wallet types, etc. being ready for the influx of unexperienced users. Even advanced users seem to be making a lot of mistakes. It's like trying to run really fast with a glass full of water.

I believe Satoshis is the only true denomination, everything else is just plain confusing. People will add more psycological value to 1,000,000 satoshis compared to 0.01 BTC or 10 mBTC.

At the moment there are plenty of potential threats and challenges, both political, cultural and technical and Bitcoin is a nascent technology, so if enough willpower was present I believe adaption could be slowed to almost a halt for a long time. The success of Bitcoin and any other crypto currency is not guaranteed by their mere existence.
However, if Bitcoin is allowed wider and wider adaption and the network, the foundation and the core developers are focused on existing and future challenges, Bitcoin could very likely gain critical mass to become vital as a monetary system. As NN Teleb says, time is the ultimate stressor towards becoming antifragile so no one will know for quite some time really.
Those are my thoughts at the moment.

What's keeping people from mass producing the ATMs so they are litterally everywhere and decentralized. Once this gets enough traction, we won't even need ATMs because bitcoin will be defacto money everywhere, thus it really is the fiat currencies that are hold the short end of the stick.

Brain wallet mining is indeed becoming a very profitable niche.
Technically it's pretty simple. Just try sentences, poems, passwords, tweets, formulas and so on from the web, books or any other electronically available media against the blockchain. There's a lot of CPU/GPU power out there just waiting to be utilized. There might even be brain wallet mining botnets - it would be obvious that someone would try to develop one.

Is this subreddit turning into - a fan club about gift cards?
I'm really not that impressed. A lot of retailers across the globe accept gift cards every day. No big deal. I would be a lot more impressed if Whole Foods started accepting bitcoins **directly**.
Right now Bitcoin happens to be accepted by Gyft as payment, just as they accept Visa, MasterCard, PayPal and all the usual suspects. 
Gyft is just a business who's discovered an untapped niche resource of loyal Bitcoin holders who have few places to spend. Tomorrow Gyft might as well accept Litecoin or some other shitty coin and then what? This really doesn't promote nor strengthens Bitcoin in the eyes of retailers and other business users as all they see is a gift card from Gyft.
What gives Bitcoin and the brand real business value is when businesses accept it directly as payment.

They can lobby for "regulation" of Bitcoin all they want in the US. It could probably ease adoption from US businesses short term until it reaches a level where dollars don't really matter anymore.

Once enough investment banks are vested in the Bitcoin, there'll be sufficient power from inside to sway governments into accepting it. It could also take nothing more than a country, say Greece or Argentina, heck even the bust of the euro to accept it as the new currency to make forreign countries into accepting it officially. I see a lot of ways this could play out without too much resistance. In any case there'll most likely always be a demand for Bitcoins and its properties.

Hi, and welcome to - I hope you stick around and educate yourself.


Actually Bitcoin is mildly inflationary as of now - 25 new bitcoins are released into the blockchain every ~10 minutes until the year 2140. The rise in price is caused by high demand as people start to recognize the usage and properties of bitcoin.


The Bitcoin community does recognize the denomination of the value as a challenge. Several suggestions in the community have tried to convince people to use centibitcoin, millibitcoin, microbitcoin and so on. Businesses are slowly adapting to the new denomination, but it'll take time.


Agreed. This is an issue, and Bitcoin might not be suited for very small micro payments as of now.


Money laundering is not an inherit issue of Bitcoin. The big banks (HSBC et al) still has that market very much to themselves. You are making false assumptions. If people did not wan't to buy bitcoin, then how do you explain the rise in price.


It's a little challenging to buy bitcoin at times depending on your preference of payment, but on we don't mind giving advice. If it was really easy to get bitcoins, the price of the bitcoin would be a lot higher. There is a huuuge interest in bitcoin from all around the world, and it will become a lot easier to get bitcoins as time goes by.


Retailers who wants to adopt bitcoin as a means of payment with little risk are advised to use a bitcoin payment gateway such as  or  - they will process the order at the equivilant dollar amount at the time of processing and deal with the risk for a small fee of 1%. If you decide to transfer bitcoins yourself, the payment is confirmed in about 10 minutes and the price will not fluctuate 100% in that amount of time. That can take .. weeks!


This is only if you opt for the reference bitcoin client. You can use a program like Electrum or even online wallets from various web sites. It's basically a trade-off of risk vs. ease-of-use as things are right now.
Please understand that bitcoin is only 4 years old, but has come quite a long way in such a short span of time. A lot of people like to compare bitcoin to the internet in the early '90s where people weren't sure what to use all that HTTP and TCP/IP stuff for. As it is right, bitcoin does have growing pains and a lot of ~~challenges~~ opportunities lies ahead.
In closing, allow me to demonstrate the power of bitcoin by giving you ~~$0.1~~ €0.1 (you are european I see).

I have for a long time been a proponent for running a full node, and I do it myself. I start my wallet from my PC and the datadir points to a mapped folder on the NAS, where it happily nodes along while the PC is on. I would love it if it was easy to somehow run a full node entirely from a NAS (Synology, QNAP, Linux, etc.). Maybe a bounty or a donation to someone with the tech skill to pull off a nice way to run full nodes on these products should be in order.
I'm not sure what the memory requirements would be, but I guess the simplest NAS-boxes don't quite meet them. In a near future though meeting the memory requirements seems feasible.
Alternatively maybe a small Raspberry Pi, that could be plugged right onto the network and set to manage a full node on a NAS or other big drive on the network.
I think we need this stuff to support the network, right?
