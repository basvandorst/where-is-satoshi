This is my first time trying to decipher anything, but this interested me, so I decided to give it a shot. Posting my progress incase it helps anyone get ideas.
To start, I sorted the cipher by grouping each of the ‘dates’ with their pre-ceding number. This gave me 14 groups from 1-14 and labelled each date by the placement it shows up in the cipher.
The first thing I did was open Excel, try different methods to get number to input into a Caesar cipher decoder. I tried adding the date digits, their placement digits, multiplying, trying various methods but found no common link between them. I would check any words I can come up with against the BIP-39 Mnemonic code database, as not all English words are seed words.
Next, I removed the first 2 years of each date, to get a 6-digit yymmdd, which I inputted into colorhexa.com to see what I can find. Each date came back with a set of 3 binary codes, which I put into binarytranslator.com. Translating them into text came back with squares or gibberish. I translated them into decimal to get another 6-digit code, which I also tried to turn into letters and tried to Caesar cipher decode but did not find anything. I then thought that the creator of the cipher probably wouldn’t think it’s fair to put in these many levels into the cipher, without any hints.
Next, I searched the full 8-digit yyyymmdd as a PMID for a journal article. I tried to use the date’s placement number to count which character to take. This seemed like a good path. I counted the characters in the title or abstract with the date’s placement number. So if 19930425 was the 6th date in the cipher and PMID: 19930425 is titled “Effects of exogenous urotensin II on vascular remodeling after balloon injury” I would take the 6th character, which is T. I couldn’t get the answer with this, there may be an additional level to this, such as group 1 means read the first line or something. I did run into some problems where a title did not have as many characters as the date’s placement, or the placement character was a space.
The few things that confuse me: There is only one date for groups 10, 13, and 14. If the dates are code for a letter, then those groups could not spell a word.
I believe that the looking at the different PMIDs and finding the right letter in each article is the key to deciphering this cipher. Figuring out which letter is what I don’t know.
If someone ends up cracking the code, and they found any of this helpful and wants to share the pot, send it to 33FZcSjYC1P6AsYL4sZmDbC5rzkHGuSLdd :D
