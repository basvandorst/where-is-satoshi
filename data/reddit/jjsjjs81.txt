From the Netherlands here. 
This is already working for us with normal
payments online. 
Open my bank app 
Scan 2D code
Press send. 
Done. 
This is called ideal. 
[ideal explanation]( 
Article is a bit old. As we now use 2D barcode scans. 
What is strange is this does not really exist outside The Netherlands. 
No fees
No entering numbers

Well. 
He means workforce as in modern times (20&amp;21st century). Women started as not working for money. They raised families. 
Except hookers... they were indeed effectively the first paid female workers.

Correct. But I mentioned modern times as before that woman were indeed contributing. This changed due to reasons I do not understand. 
But somewhere during the Middle Ages women became severely oppressed and de facto stopped being in the labor force. 
Obviously if you go back even further. Women were working. But there was no money (ice age times). 
Hence my comment about modern workforce. 
Were in fact indeed hookers were the first woman participating in making money! 
Just facts.

Not my bullshit dude. 
Just facts. ��
And in fact mr petersons opinion. 
Merely clarifying what he said on this topic.

Because OP tried to login with wrong data. 
You need you wallet address AND your password and or your 12 words to identify/recover.

Why would you need them in cold storage? 
And what is that? 
Like a personal wallet (like blockchain wallet)?
