Replace "Money" with "Gold", and then see how that statement isn't quite as valid. Bitcoin is more like gold than money in my book.

What is the recovery procedure? Can't you just enter your bitcoin public address online to see how many bitcoin are in that address (to ensure none of it has been stolen) ?

Newbie here: How can I see online how much cash is in an arbitrary bitcoin public address?

Apparently whilst good for bitcoin, Ether and a couple of others, the ledger wallet is poor for most altcoins. And I don't trust any company to make a device specifically meant to store crypto. Also the reviews on Amazon aren't overwhelmingly positive.
I'd rather just use either paper, or two pen drives with Keepass on to store all the wallets. Simpler and more secure in my opinion.

Thanks. Does that work for most altcoins, or just bitcoin? If the former, do you know of another site?
Just want to look occasionally to make sure the funds haven't been stolen from my wallet.

Rather go the paper route to be honest, and just store the two necessary strings - the public and private address. Just wondering if there's a place online to enter a public address (I'll type it by reading from the paper), and it'll tell you how much is in the wallet.

I thought it was only IOTA where you had to generate a new public private key/address when you sent money from that wallet.
Can't you keep the old public + private key?

In theory. In practice, it could end up unusable as a currency simply because of the fees and because it's so slow, especially since other rival altcoins have superior tech. I speculate however it will however still be valued because of its rarity, just like gold.


I think that the vast majority of its worth comes not from its practical utility but because of its rarity and the 'irrational' value people place upon it. Bitcoin is similar in many respects.

Thanks. Will that site work for other altcoins or just bitcoin?

Nothing's certain yet surely?
Their home page now says:
"In light of recent news reports and the potential repercussions on MtGox's operations and the market, a decision was taken to close all transactions for the time being in order to protect the site and our users. We will be closely monitoring the situation and will react accordingly."

How much $ did you lose?

Lol, up by 5x despite the crash. Do you even invest in non-BTC coins?

Will I benefit from the fork if I keep my bitcoin on the exchange?
Does the benefit somehow increase the value of the bitcoin? If so by how much?

Hello, thanks for this tool! Why did you create it, and what are the disadvantags / advantages over using Walletgenerator.net ?
Also, any plans to allow the user to insert their private key, and it gives the corresponding address?
Also, where's Nano? :P
