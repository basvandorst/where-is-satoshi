What other coins are more profitable to mine?

Do you agree?
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:21:07
Such as?

@_date: 2014-03-03 17:32:28
Agreed that it's not "hard". But it's not just the trading engine that would have to be created. It would also be the coin management system. The hot/cold wallet interfaces. By creating this, we can help define the best practices of the industry. This can also be used to test any changes to any upcoming bitcoind changes.
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:27:38
Right... buttercoin went private and abandoned their open-sourceness. Which is exactly what I'm proposing we rectify. The repo hasn't been updated in over 6 months.
Intersango? Same story.
I know that the idea has been tried before, but it's like smoking cessation. The best indicator of success is the number of attempts you make. So as a community, I say we give it another go. There's more knowledge out there now than there was in the Intersango days. More competent developers and a more clear understanding of the necessity of such a product.
We build it as a reference implementation of what an exchange should be.
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:12:18
As for volume - imagine if there was a built in clearing mechanism so that multiple exchanges running this system could share liquidity? Now that's decentralized!
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:05:01
So what say you, Internet, can we get together 4-6 decent developers to commit to this?
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:45:40
That's up to the implementer. We are making a reference implementation that's hardened by many eyes. If an exchange rises that needs software to use, this could be there waiting for them. As a community, we cannot afford to let exchanges fail repeatedly. This will lead to a consolidation of power and yes.. centralization.
By having software ready to use, we eliminate (reduce) the software risks associated with such a business and leave it to willing and ready entrepreneurs to mount the legal and financial aspects of such an endeavor.
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:51:46
That's less likely, I feel
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:11:02
Exactly - and it's ideas like that and minds like yours that can make a real difference in the ecosystem.
I've been considering a completely transparent mechanism where the exchange functions as a wallet (ala blockchain.info) as well, so everyone is fully aware of where THEIR funds are.
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:48:18
I [agree completely](
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:22:56
Is that a "no"?
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:19:00
Any interest in coinsetter.co or coinsetter.net?
@_date: 2019-01-03 14:04:44
I’m sure it has.  But has any result of that been shared anywhere?

What does Doxx mean?
@_date: 2013-05-25 11:25:21
Negative. The original owners of bitcoin owned a smaller and smaller percentage of all bitcoins because more were being mined. With OpenCoin, the original owners own less and less because they are giving / selling them

SSL Certificate is on it's way. We're still in private beta, so we haven't enabled the certificate for non-trading yet. But thank you for the feedback =)
@_date: 2013-05-08 18:41:51
Both. Depending on what yields a better price for our client.
@_date: 2013-07-31 01:39:44
You're right... we should have answered sooner but have been dealing with so many things related to the public beta launch. We'll try to be more communicative
@_date: 2013-05-01 11:33:39
I hope we meet your expectations. Coming soon, so I hope you signed up for our beta.
@_date: 2013-08-09 00:49:15
Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2013-05-06 11:45:03
I'd like to suggest an alternative. MtGox certainly is the largest, but I've recently launched  as a meta exchange that uses other exchanges as liquidity providers. 
@_date: 2013-08-02 11:07:35
We just added an additional entry mechanism so that you can place orders similar to how others do it

A lot of great questions. As noted, we don't do fiat for now so we're not registered as money transmitters.
I can probably do 15 pushups in 60 seconds and I'll let my partners answer for themselves :)
@_date: 2013-05-08 18:35:33
Back up and running.
@_date: 2013-05-03 05:39:50
If you registered,  it's on it's way soon. How much USD or BTC were you thinking of depositing? 
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:52:42
Announcing [Crypto Street]( which allows you to exactly that. We take the hassle away from you having to have accounts at multiple exchanges.
@_date: 2013-08-11 23:54:17
Try to explain the concept of the Bitcoin network (and ports) to an 8 year old.. it's a challenge. =)
@_date: 2013-05-10 18:03:17
Yes - but how? Literally get the private key and write it on the paper?
@_date: 2013-05-03 05:17:46
Just launched our market depth page at [Crypto Street]( It's amazing to see the *bid* and the *ask* overlap. We're still accepting signups to be invited into our beta. Feedback welcome.
@_date: 2013-05-06 18:39:57
Please help with visibility then. Tweet it out. Spread the gospel
@_date: 2013-07-31 22:15:54
We'll also be adding a quick tutorial to our blog:  so keep an eye out there.
@_date: 2013-05-25 19:15:02
Would like to add this is a work in progress and we welcome feedback. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 11:32:49
You would only have to have an account with us. No need to have accounts at other exchanges. Plus, with our own liquidity,  we're hoping that we can eventually arrive at a universal price.
@_date: 2013-05-14 11:39:42
Who do you use?
@_date: 2013-05-11 00:57:29
Thank you, thank you! We're pretty stoked. My issue with Cassiscus (no offense to anyone) is that they're the only ones doing it. There is no audit process (that I know of) or any way to prove that they haven't copied the private key themselves. Not saying that they would, but it is a possibility.
@_date: 2013-06-30 12:50:22
If snooki embraced bitcoin, I wonder how quickly we'd all abandon it :)

That would be me :). We should hang out and talk about Bitcoin. Where you located? 
@_date: 2013-08-15 11:18:05
Your sentiment is well received. We are moving somewhat slowly so that we can be sure to do things well.
We've agonized over every detail of our platform and we may not always get it right the first time, but we try to rapidly apply what we learn.
We have (and are) looked (/ing) into other jurisdictions. But even that is a time consuming process and potentially costly to do it well.
@_date: 2013-06-19 01:55:21
Wouldn't that be something?
@_date: 2013-05-03 15:50:04
You can find this at [Crypto Street]( The market depth page displays the aggregate order books from all of the large exchanges.
@_date: 2013-04-29 20:33:25
Absolutely. On all account / trading pages, https is implemented. We're working on a secure way to implement in on the not so password relevant pages.
 - appreciate the complement =)

Forgetting which stock exchange we list on, do you think it makes sense to have an IPO to fund our expansion into Fiat currencies?
@_date: 2013-05-10 18:02:10
I know they're popular now, but will they last 20 years? New technology like "Firewire" or "Internet" may come.
@_date: 2013-08-02 11:06:56
There's a reason we don't do it the way the other exchanges do. [This blog post](  should explain it. But we are working on a dynamic calculator to help normalize things.
@_date: 2013-04-30 14:36:47
Just added a ticker for BTC and LTC against USD. Currently, there's still a large [bitcoin arbitrage]( opportunity at [Crypto Street]( That's why the ask is lower than the bid  :)
@_date: 2013-05-10 18:10:20
Why would another crypto work if Bitcoin fails?
@_date: 2013-05-07 01:14:06
We are clarifying our deposit methods as I write this. Should have an update shortly
@_date: 2013-08-23 11:38:50
This will probably not be enabled on launch. We'll add it soon after though
@_date: 2013-05-03 12:39:58

@_date: 2013-04-30 23:40:37
That's exactly what we're looking into. The long tail of arbitrage. There are lots and lots of exchanges with low volume and our platform will help them achieve more volume. All this while allowing early traders access to these arbitrage opportunities.
@_date: 2013-04-30 20:10:35
for both LTC and BTC
@_date: 2013-06-30 12:48:23
If you see me, tip me :)
@_date: 2013-08-14 23:12:27
We're definitely working hard to operate very well within our limited scope. But in future planning, an IPO doesn't seem like all that bad of an idea to help raise the funds necessary to tackle the challenges of fiat.
Our technology can handle fiat, so that's not the limiting factor. The limiting factor is the regulatory framework around it - and that's what's so costly.
@_date: 2013-08-22 15:24:21
We won't be OAuth'ing (at least not to start). We'll have the API Key/Secret methodology where you send a HASHED secret through.
@_date: 2013-11-13 12:19:32
I think by the time we approach $1000, a lot of people will change their out to $2,000 or even $5,000. The people in the space are not all emotionless traders. They set a goal so far away because they don't need the money right now. 
@_date: 2013-06-30 12:49:48
Haha, glad to know. I'll keep an eye out for you
@_date: 2013-08-26 02:23:41
So first... make sure you encrypted it with a passphrase. That can be done with the satoshi client rather easily. 
Now you only need to secure one file, wallet.dat. So encrypt that file as a .zip or something to add yet another layer of protection. For obfuscation purposes, compress a bunch of things in that zip file that are seemingly more important (copies of bank statements, etc).
Okay, now it's not smart to split this file up. Instead, do the opposite. Share it in many places. First, copy to a USB flash key and store in a drawer somewhere. Next, email yourself a copy.
What if your email gets hacked!??! Find a free web host, make an account and store a copy there. Boom. As long as the web host doesn't go down, you're good.
But what if they do???? Dropbox will probably be around for a while, so throw a copy up there too.
You can do this with a variety of services. But you get the point. You have multiple layers of protection. First, someone must KNOW where the file is. Next, they must crack the zip password. Next, they must see that this tiny text file is more valuable than all of the other zipped files. Next, they must import the wallet file. Now to spend it, they need yet anothet password.
Just my .0002 btc.

Not sure why you'd be concerned. I have my methods of securing bitcoins for the future. Was trying to spark a discussion about it from others
