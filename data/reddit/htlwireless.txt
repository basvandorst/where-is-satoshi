Change Your QR Codes without changing the image:
Sometimes the codes are printed on marketing materials and then there is an alteration in the phone number or web site URL. Now to alter the contents of a QR code after it has been generated and without changing the QR code image, you need to use a QR code generator which allows this. Not all QR code generators will let you do that. I am using a web site called QR JUMPS  to do it. It is a free service but you need to create an account with them. Once a QR code is generated, you can log in to your account and make changes to the contents by using the edit option. Tip to 1DFdSNcVNmgHgUqoSvMwJA1REHK2QPRQfY
