Oh, I'm gonna check that, thanks :)

Watch this, it should explain everything. 
I'm new to Bitcoin too (I kinda understood Bitcoin before, but just a little bit). (See what I did there? Just a little *bit*? Hah, funny strikes again.)
Anyways, here's something to get you started. 100 bits That's about 0.04$, but it's just to get you started. Create a wallet on  and connect it with your reddit account to claim the bits :)
EDIT: Oh, I see you collected your tip! Good job, have fun with Changetip and remember to tip others :D

(Testing, this may be a huge fail) Here you go! 250 bits EDIT: Oh, here we go, I now know how to tip people! :D

Hmm.. yeah I was thinking about the high risks so I'm probably not doing it. Thanks for your opinion :)

Trust me, it isn't. Just think of it this way. Bitcoins are worth around 400$ and then mBTC and μBTC are just smaller bits. That's it :)

Haha, no, bits not bitcoins. 100 Bitcoins is like 35000$ :D
You'd be quite lucky to receive 100 Bitcoins xD
Here are the units:
Bitcoin - 1 Bitcoin = 349.02$ (USD) but this changes quickly.                                                                      
mBTC - 1 mBitcoin = 0.001 of a Bitcoin                                                                                                 
μBTC - 1 μBitcoin = 0.000001 of a Bitcoin                                                                                               
Note: There are many more units but these are the most used ones as far as I know.                            
So I just gave you 100 bits. Bit is basically μBitcoin so you just got 100 μBitcoin which is 0.0001 of a Bitcoin :)
