They just partnered with Twitch though. Definitely the perfect audience for crypto payments.

You’re mad because a credit card company won’t let you take their credit and purchase what most consider a risky investment? If you don’t have the cash, don’t invest.

Good on you. Your decision. Their decision. Calling them out for trying to protect their interest makes you look like you’re whining. Crypto was originally seen as a bad thing because of its potential for money laundering. What’s to stop everyone from maxing out their credit cards and buying Bitcoin then filing bankruptcy with all their coins in cold storage. Use cash for coin. Risk what you can lose, not capital one.

I've never checked out bitstamp until now. Pretty clean site.  I may look into switching.

Someone probably put in a market order and no one was there to fill until the buy orders got that low. Don’t don’t do market orders. The panic selling is only fucking those selling. The market will come back.

Drops do seem to happen more on the weekend when working people have free time to sit and stare at the market and worry about their investment. Hmmm....

Bitcoin traders are at risk because the government and sec won’t be able to protect funds if they’re lost in an ico? No shit. Shit article.

GDAX is the smoothest so far. A lot of of the other exchanges are experiencing lost coins and stuff. The IOTA hype yesterday about crashed them. I think GDAX must be better suited for growth. Just buy coins and hold. A lot of people are going to get a slap in the face for trying to become overnight day traders.

That’s bitcoin mined not each transaction. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:40:44
Try GDAX. Its seamless to transfer from coinable and is relatively stable.

I sent $20 in litecoin to a friend yesterday and it only charged me $.13.

Theres a lot of fuckery afoot trying to shake things up.

I did a the same thing yesterday. Hodler now. We all hold we all win

Do you realize how much you sound like a used car salesman? I’m guessing you’re talking about Bitcoin cash, because you all have the same sales pitch. “The real Bitcoin”
I just have to say one thing: fuck your agenda.

It’s hard for people to understand the idea of a currency that gains in value. 
Not only are citizens being robbed by reckless taxation and spending. We are being robbed by reckless printing that makes your dollar less and less valuable. It’s accepted because it is what we are use to, but when you really think about it it’s fucking robbery and people should be pissed. 
The fact that the government feels entitled to tax another currency is example of their lack of accountability and greed. But what do we expect when we vote corporate shills in as our leaders.

That’s honestly how I took the futures addition in general. The more I read the more confusing it gets. So many memes about a crash. I feel like people want it to dip so they can up their holdings when the wallstreeet bull is let loose.

It's taking up to a week to show up sometimes. You still have your purchase it just isn't showing up. Coinbase is rising in popularity so slow downs are normal. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:49:35
Well considering it just keeps going up. Last night I thought I’ll wait until morning to see where we are at. New ATH new ATH. It fluctuates a small amount but for the most part it’s still a steady rise.

This is good for bitcoin right? Doesn’t this mean that more tangible assets have to be secured into the bitcoin market?

Idk what you mean buy advantage but I think the value in them will go up. Having wallstreet putting money into crypto only increases the pool alts can pull from. Bitcoin will always be here. It’s getting too expensive for startups. You’re already seeing the backlash bitcoin is getting for energy consumption. If I’m wrong hedge with solar and wind energy. Win win! 
Also previous bitcoin bubbles shouldn’t be factored in when investing in crypto now. Wallstreet wasn’t involved then. Bitcoin will only grow in the long term.
