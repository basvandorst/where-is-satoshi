This and do not take loans thinking you can beat the market! Know a dude who is living pay check to pay check took out a 6-7K loan. Down to nearly 1K and now owes 10k total due to interest. Infact I think he might have sold the rest of that 1K smh ��‍♂️

Exactly this,  today is my buy in day but will wait a bit on the side lines. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 02:16:46
OP I too had enough of Coin Bases shenanigans. I had buy and withdraw limits that I was very happy and took me long to get too. My ID Expired and I just updated it with my new one a few weeks back. Now my buy limit is $25! for debit and 1K for bank buy ins. And they hold my Bit Coin for transfer up to 16 days! WTF is wrong with them. I for one am moving on to Gemini.  
@_date: 2018-09-28 13:38:10

@_date: 2018-09-19 13:47:09
Personally from what I saw in the last recession people forget this is global not just in the US. Bitcoin will most likely rise in a scenario like that since many smart investors already with cash in hand will put a % in there. We can either see a huge rise or most likely a stable Bitcoin that will give and attract the confidence of new comers. Right now that scenario is not so far fetched. We have a tariffs war going on, no matter if your for or against it you have no control of that. And it will affect us all if it continues. How does Bit Coin come in this scenario,? Well It will hold a greater value then the free fall of the dollars buying power. While they can keep printing more of it does not mean it can keep up with rising costs. Just my opinion...
@_date: 2018-09-27 14:25:14
Same here plenty of time by 2020, feels good.

@_date: 2018-09-23 15:56:37
Ifs really sad what's going on down there. This is exactly why Bitcoin was created for to not rely on a corrupt government. Best of luck to anyone over they but I read many are migrating the hell out of there. But I also read some are coming back, BitCoin can lead the way. 
@_date: 2018-09-18 14:22:10
Is anyone here putting money In Alts or an alt coin with the goal of obtaining one full bit coin? Some people can't afford to get one full BitCoin and that is the main goal to hold one for the next few years. I am wondering if that is a good idea. I am pushing to buy as much Bitcoin as I can each salary, but it's hard to buy one full one. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 01:47:47

I need some feed back on my strategy here. At the moment I can't make very good buys in to Bitcoin until December. So what ever little I do have to spear I'm going in on 2 Alt coins that have much promise. Basically if those moon I will of course convert them to get more Bitcoin. Would like to hear feed back on this strategy. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 00:13:39
We'll see, I'm done with my alt positions now pushing to get that 1 Bit Coin its super hard. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 14:20:15
Thank you for the feed back. I'll be patient..

It just didn't feel right.  And Neo wtf is now super cheap. Hoping I can buy in now just for fun a few coins.

I wish all the shit coins could be flushed out and we keep the King and a few other worthy projects. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 21:16:36
This is good, I'm hoping a royal flush is around the corner. Some of those scam coins need to go!

Lol ok dude great that you have that passion in you. Now chill and enjoy the week end ����
@_date: 2018-08-14 14:04:00
This is what I told my friend as well. She was hearing all the stories of how people became super wealthy off Bit Coin etc. I told yes it's true but there is also the other side to that. I said just buy what you can cheap and hold and pretend that investment is gone. I did recommend her to check in of course once in a while. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 23:02:40
I am in it for Main Stream adoption and a nice bump in my portfolio. I don't care for a Lambo or anything materialistic but for the freedom to live. That's it all I want is to live a good life. I would trade a Lambo any day for a nice meal some drinks a relaxing time and the company of a loved one. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 02:26:16
Congrats! I had half of one :( but lost it. I am working hard to get back up there.

Fiat value is going down badly. Many people don't understand that they are heading for slavery. Just yesterday a Uber picked me up dude looked professional. He told me he just got out of his job working for the city. Most people's I know here in my city are working 2 jobs to keep up with the cost of living. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 14:15:44
All my friends say that it's too late for them �� I explained to them it's still early in the game. And I have been coming in and out of the market. OP do your research and see if this is for you. I personally love it and see it as a hobby.
@_date: 2018-10-07 19:38:51
A nope not at all just you OP ifs all a matter of perspective. I'm excited as f to be part of this ����. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 14:40:51
Yup 
@_date: 2018-10-09 14:26:08
Yes a lot, I made a decent amount on the last bull run. But could have made even more enough to quit my job for a year on a alt coin. Bitcoin also made me big gains. But  also those who bought at the very top and pulled out lost money. For me is not about immediate gains is the long run. You have to have a strong mind to get in this. Read the stories where people lost you'll learn what mistakes not to make. There was this guy that got a 100k loan and got liquidated, just blinded by greed. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 01:07:35
This is true some are in debt for life. Their salaries cannot keep up with the interest. 
@_date: 2018-10-03 14:34:43
Holy f and they just keep printing more and more of it. How can people not wake up and realize it. 
@_date: 2018-10-02 14:20:19
Best of luck OP but I am sure you don't need it since you are working hard �� I'm looking to do something in the Bitcoin Space too down the line.

Same here I see Bitcoin as a saver to be honest. I have more value stashed away there then the nights of partying and hang overs. I think twice now. And let's be honest people most of us spend our money on dumb f*^% sht. Over the top prices coffee, clothes you really don't need, experience sneakers, weed and alcohol.  Well we need the last two once in a while to unwind but that's when we make mad gains right..
