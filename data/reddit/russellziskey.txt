Seems I got a similar error. Did you try building version 2.6?

I'm running this right now. Awaiting more BTC in my Coinbase account before I can make any firm conclusions. Since you can develop your own trading strategies and set your own parameters, I don't think it matters if ten people run zenbot or ten thousand. Right now, zenbot is trying to buy BTC but alas - I have no cash in my Coinbase account (only BTC). I will report back tomorrow once my deposit clears.

I'm going to try to run this. I'll let you know if I run across this error. What linux distro, npm version, and node js version are you running?
