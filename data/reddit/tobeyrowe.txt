By the way I almost forgot to mention that part of Hakuna_Potato's donation will go back into the community from me giving players the bitcoin to help the game and economy grow. But this will be done once the Bitcoin plugin is fixed or a new one is put in. And also just because the Bitcoin plugin is not working right now does not mean you cant play on the server. you are more than welcomed to come play still you just wont be able to earn or transact any bitcoins right now but you can still do other things. Thank you for understanding and please come join us if you haven't already.

Hi, everyone. sorry it has taken me a while to respond to your messages I normally don't check reddit that often. First off I would like to thank Hakuna_Potato for the donation he sent through changetip. I am aware now that the plugin I was using was not a good plugin for this because it doesn't allow for withdraws for some reason so I am working on getting a new plugin so if everyone could be patient while I work this out that would be great. As of right now the plugins that we have that will stay are clearlag, lockette, courtjustice, landlord, playervaults, and some others but they are only meant for staff like worldguard and stuff like that. If anyone has any questions or comments please feel free to email me at austin11rowe and I will answer your questions as soon as I can. Thank you all and again special thanks to Hakuna_Potato for the donation :).
