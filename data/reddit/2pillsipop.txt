Bots are just transferring around small amounts. 
People rather buy and hold. Not much spending going on till the price goes back up.

It's because there are people going long and short using margin and then they either pump or dump the price so they can make money.

Someone has been buying millions worth for 2 years. Otherwise the price would have fell and never recovered. So big money is in and now they wait as people who were only in it for the next bubble slowly exit and bring the price down. Big money can wait years for the halvings.

They need as much info to make sure you and your friends are not doing anything illegal with the bitcoins. If you are they will close your account and monitor your friends account / close them too.

Depends how long people can get away with shorting Bitcoin and make money. If they can short it down to $125 and make money then price will be $125.

Unless the individuals keeping the market up are doing it just to short. Then in the end they'll pump it, dump it all and cash out. Leaving everyone bagholding and a price that'll never recover because the wealthy have more reason to not use bitcoin. 
All that'll be left are some people playing with bitcoin when the price is $25-$75 just to mess with the bagholders.

Say you got a coin. Say you have a way to make money that incorporates the coin. Say you put some profit from the sales into the coin. The sales continue to grow as people keep buying. Profit gets thrown into the coin. People don't want to sell because profit from the sales keep getting put into this coin. Soon this coin is worth billions and overtakes bitcoin.
