That's because most USD people were trading on Gox although there had been serious issues with fiat withdrawals there for many months. Now everybody suddenly discovered Kraken. Such lame.

ZeroCoin still not planned to implement. Time for real anonymous currency. zerocoin.org
@_date: 2014-03-01 17:12:27
"untraceable nature"? Are you kidding? Have you heard of the blockchain? As long as zerocoin is not implemented it is the most traceable currency in the world. Every totalitarian government dream.

If assets are frozen you can't buy bitcoin with them so there's no point in thinking that it will cause a surge in bitcoin demand. Except you imply that demand will come from Russians with no frozen assets but that doesn't make sense to me.

Five years in existence and these dinosaurs keep asking "what is bitcoin?". I wonder how much time must pass before they stop asking this.

I hate to watch Bloomberg jerks: interrupting each other and almost screaming at each other. And they always support US regime agenda between the lines and this time even outright: coin validation. Mathew Mellon working really hard with Congress. I bet!
And Miller even describes this bankster as "bitcoin enthusiast" who he "know he's working really hard". Yes, Miller, put him for 5 minutes in one room with bitcoin enthusiasts and he will be torn apart for his "hard work with Congress" on coin validation.

*We have released an alpha version of libzerocoin, a library suitable for integration into Bitcoin clients. See software. 
*We still need to:*
    Continue to improve the library.
    Provide a BIP style specification of the Zerocoin protocol
    Get someone integrate it into bitcoin/litecoin/any-coin
Because of the disinterest from the bitcoin dev team Zerocoin is planned to be released as a new altcoin.

May be true:
*A Hong Kong-based research firm has warned investors that HSBC has overstated its assets by £50bn and will therefore need to inject £70bn worth of capital by 2020.*

Hi, linux user here.
There's no "Pay .... option" on right-click in linux Chrome. 
This option appears only when the address is highlighted which makes it less convenient and creates the risk of sending BTC to the wrong address (when incorrectly highlighted).

XT is not an altcoin because you will be able to send Bitcoin to XT forked chain. You can't do that with altcon - for example you can't send litecoin to bitcoin address.

I'm not talking about testing natural altcoin traffic. I'm talking about testing artificial altcoin traffic (spamming the altcoin blockchain on purpose to see the technical effect of increasing the volume of transactions and how the software manage increased traffic via increased blocksize limit.

The banks are closed for 10 days now and counting. Euros outside the banks are quickly running dry and now ones (salary) are stuck on the closed banks. Bitcoin is obviously of no help here anyway.

I wonder if next after Bakkt are naked shorts to drive the price down. For now we have margin trading but naked shorts will come next. It's banks' fundamental trick in gold/silver price manipulation.

The "Cyprus effect" is in fact bots on Mt.Gox. Because their activity coincided (quite far but somehow people see the connection) with the Cyprus events people still think the price spike was caused by people buying bitcoins due to flight to safety where in reality bots artificially manipulating the price is much more probable cause for the price spike. 
When you look at the trading bot activity data it's pretty obvious - the biggest price spike occured in November 2013 and the biggest bot activity occured in November 2013. It's no brainer to connect the two. The Cyprus accounts confiscation occured in March 2013 which is rather far from November.

Tell that to people who bought at the price of 1100 USD during the Mt.Gox Willy-bot induced bull run.
