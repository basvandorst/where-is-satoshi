A good, reliable exchange like Coinsetter would be my suggestion :-).
@_date: 2015-06-03 21:28:00
As a Bitcoin insider, I'm not very impressed with anything coming out of the Chinese exchanges. I also don't want to sit on the sidelines and let another Mt. Gox happen. All I'm hearing is dubious business practices, and dubious statistics about the real performance of their businesses. Its a shame. I don't pretend to understand Chinese cultural norms, but it feels like there is a fast-and-loose attitude operating there, and anything goes as long as you beat the competition. To my knowledge there is little integrity or oversight in place of any kind to keep business operators in check in China.
It isn't enough simply to tell people to 'be forewarned' or 'buyer beware'. 
I want to be emphatic: I think people should stay away from Chinese bitcoin exchanges.
@_date: 2015-06-10 16:48:46
Its a great idea in theory but in practice there are so many ways that an exchange could manipulate the results that we at Coinsetter decided against it for now. We didn't think customers would find it very informative. That said, we're still open to the idea. The other problem is just cost and priorities. Customers aren't demanding it vs. other features that they are asking for more urgently.
@_date: 2015-06-05 19:35:11
Since Chinese exchanges lack credibility or integrity, they don't really merit having much say in what happens with bitcoin core, in my opinion.

FYI, Coinbase's announcement was the 'news' behind the runup and this morning's decline.
BTW, Coinsetter's Exchange is up and running smoothly if you want a reliable and high volume US regulated exchange.
@_date: 2015-01-27 21:55:42
Coinsetter and other bitcoin ventures have been in the same position vis a vis US regulation. Coinbase isn't in some privileged position in this respect. Neither is Gemini or any other exchange.

Super-frustrating for us here in the US as well.
@_date: 2015-08-14 15:54:44
As a company that submitted the BitLicense application, I think this article is extremely immature and disingenuous. So many ready vocal voices of criticism about regulation by people who seemingly have too little life experience to wisely judge the prudence of regulation and its merits. Seeing childish articles like this, along with numerous reddit posts of the same is an unfortunate sign of how much further the bitcoin industry has to go to mature. Bitcoin won't achieve mass adoption if children are running companies that handle people's money. I can't wait for bitcoin to move beyond this level of conversation.

Very smart to test this!!! Nice idea.

I'm not convinced that NY is oppressive. Show me a public that is overwhelmingly confident that their money can be safely entrusted to a bitcoin exchange or business anywhere in the US or in other mature countries. Then we'll see whether regulation is too restrictive, or whether it is in fact doing what it is meant to do, which is first and foremost to protect the customer.
I'm not a huge fan of regulation or many of its overarching objectives, but protecting customers is something that - like it or not - regulation is most fit to address. Coinsetter is here to stay in NY. We're here to fight for bitcoin's future and not abandon it or cowardly run away.
I'd also caution people who think they can achieve perfect anonymity using Tor or other software. The internet was never designed to ensure anonymity.
@_date: 2015-08-08 23:16:21
Coinsetter isn't afraid of regulation. We're based in NYC, and we're applying for the BitLicense, because we're here to stay! We will not abandon NY customers, or customers in any other state or country where we are committed to helping the currency and technology of bitcoin. If you want to be able to use bitcoin and trade it, its easy to get started:  
One positive side of regulation is that it ensures protection of customer capital, and we've seen that too many bitcoin exchanges - run by inexperienced, even incompetent executive teams - couldn't even preserve their customer's capital. While I'm not a huge fan of regulation, I don't think customers have many other tools with which to ensure the safety of their capital.

Try Coinsetter ( Our team has prior experience building FOREX trading systems, FIX Protocol APIs, and general financial and security experience. All of our team members are senior, meaning 10+ years of experience each. Frustrating that we've not grown our liquidity and trading volume in comparison, (because of regulatory restrictions and limited US banking) when other shady sites like Bitfinex and Bitstamp and btc.e attract customers despite very prominent shortcomings. I'm amazed that customers are so willing to trust these sites when it is so easy to discover that they are violating laws, failing to establish proper security procedures, and failing to build industry standard trading software.
 Unfortunately, It does say a lot about the value of regulation. Without it, customers make poor choices, and companies invariably take short-cuts in pursuit of profit.

I agree Matt. Hopefully the blocksize controversy doesn't hurt bitcoin's credibility or value over the long-term. But it is so clear that bitcoin and its blockchain technology offer a revolutionary set of benefits whose importance goes far beyond a currency that is merely an alternative or complement to fiat.

Yeah, it isn't credible to argue that because people are using bitcoin for 'real' transactions, that the exchanges are losing utility. If that were the case, we wouldn't have a multi-trillion dollar daily FX industry.

Not having a mass-market hit does not make you a failure. Many of his architecture principles are used in civic construction today. He made many small contributions, which doesn't make him a failure. Many famous people like Robert Kiyosaki were taught and inspired by him while in college as well.

Wow. Nice job!!!! Congrats to helping the core devs and coming up with a simple solution for people to participate. That really cuts out the beaurocracy :-). An imperfect solution is better than none at all, why not have a few? I still support the Bitcoin Foundation's best efforts as well.

Very true. I didn't think that Bitcoin would replace credit cards, but after traveling to Calgary recently and coming back I found three false charges to my AMEX. And I didn't even leave the hotel for the entire business trip. That and the fraud I've been reading about surrounding Apple Pay and I'm now pretty much convinced that the credit card infrastructure and plumbing need to be thrown out. It simply can't work reliably and securely for today's world.

Anyone who wants to help promote bitcoin dev is welcome as far as I'm concerned. Its naive to think it can just plod ahead with an unpaid and unthanked group of individual developers. Either put in some grass-roots groups now or risk private enterprises a la IBM or Oracle Corp. putting their money and power to bear, and when that happens they'll take a lot of the power and control.

@_date: 2015-03-18 17:36:01
Yes, having an upper threshold on a given transaction is essential for a hot wallet strategy. It won't work otherwise. Problem is, many attacks just use several small transactions.
@_date: 2015-03-18 17:39:14
Yeah, if use multiple servers, and you put the transaction servers behind one or multiple firewalls, and on separate IPs/geo-distributed, and they are only triggered via a back-end process, and the process is the only one with the privileges to trigger / connect to the servers, then you have a solution that addresses a number of vectors. Other steps are still necessary to carefully define, esp. the coded automation logic/process itself.
@_date: 2015-03-18 00:05:26
That won't solve the problem. There are a lot of attack vectors for hot wallets. Poorly written and vulnerable software, bad sever security settings/configurations, poor/no automation fraud detections, bad/inadequate internal company controls, bad/inadequate employ oversight, social engineering attacks, etc. 
Using a third party's multi-sig service for a hot wallet will solve ZERO of the above risk scenarios.
Its very unwise to jump on the multi-sig or third party wallet service as the solution.
@_date: 2015-03-18 17:35:06
Yeah, that's a good strategy. 
I wouldn't use Windows though (Coinsetter doesn't permit that as a company policy). 
And I would steer clear of non-compiled languages. I honestly don't think Python has any business in finance (or PHP, Perl, etc.). Non-compiled code alone is a big vulnerability. With Java, C, C++, etc. you can use code obfuscation in addition to having binary files. Remove all read privileges in UNIX env. and you'll have some fairly tight controls on the source code.
@_date: 2015-03-17 23:59:40
Yes, but a very expensive lesson, to both businesses and consumers alike, as well as to bitcoin's reputation. The consumers suffer the most by far, and have little to no tools to vet and verify a business, to monitor its practices routinely, and to any recourse once funds are lost. This all needs to change very fast or bitcoin will simply cease being a consumer currency.
@_date: 2015-03-18 00:01:27
Wish we could convince all customers that instant processing of their funds is a bad idea, but customers demand it, so businesses provide it. We've lost customers because Coinsetter doesn't provide hot wallets. Its frustrating for a business when you do things safely, only to have customers go and use a less secure exchange. Make that VERY frustrating.
@_date: 2015-03-04 01:53:22
I don't mean to sound disparaging, but Canada's exchanges aren't known for listing high grade securities, or for holding high standards for registration, compliance, and accounting transparency, to protect investors from fraud or extremely high risk/dubious business models.
If a firm that only raised CAD800k in funds is able to be listed on a stock exchange, it speaks to the extremely low barrier to entry.
Getting listed in the US, in London is a benchmark that really matters.
@_date: 2015-03-17 23:57:30
What trap are you referring to? Centralization? Use of hot wallets by businesses? Trusting bitcoin to a business? The bitcoin economy would remain very tiny if none of those existed. That said, it is sad that so many companies are having bitcoin thefts. It reflects badly on us all.

@_date: 2015-03-17 23:55:57
multi-sig is not a be-all / end-all solution to hot wallets or wallets in general. You have to understand a business's use-case in choosing to implement a hot wallet, which is all about 'speed' and 'automation' (ie no manual review, no waiting for confirmations). 'Hot Wallets' are a challenge for bitcoin businesses, though I agree with you that they can definitely add a lot of additional security protection.
@_date: 2015-02-15 20:32:56
As CTO of a bitcoin exchange, this is so frustrating. Yet another exchange outright lies or fails to properly build and secure their system. This makes the rest of us look bad, and invites regulators or others to come in and take action to address the actions of an incompetent few.
I feel sad for all those who've lost money in the bitcoin space, and for whom the predominant and lingering question of the day is, "How can I as an individual evaluate a Bitcoin business and know that it is doing what it should to properly secure the capital I entrust to it?"
@_date: 2015-03-19 16:12:33
Hey nice job, that's a very clever calculation! You can take this a couple steps further and calculate the average % of fraudulent bitcoins transacted per month, as well as the actual numbers for each month in history.
This would get us to some fraud metrics we can then use to compare with credit cards and other financial payment processing methods.
@_date: 2015-03-19 04:04:37

This is something I've talked with people about implementing. The question is, will anyone really pay to send email and will that really help separate out valuable emails from junk? The payor needs some metrics/confidence that this service will be worth it. As a recipient, if the cost is too high, you'll miss potentially valuable emails, but if its too low, you'll still get junk.

Tell me about it. It is extremely frustrating for any business trying to operate in this space. A business needs customers, has overhead, must make payroll, must deliver results to investors. All of this is made more difficult when regulators step in but fail to act.

Whether you like it or not, we all must play by the rules in our country. KYC / AML, regulation, compliance, insurance, etc. This is the way our society runs. If that isn't acceptable, then the rules have to be changed, but they can't be ignored or flouted without serious consequences. No form of technology provides for an easy out.
@_date: 2015-02-25 01:31:50
This isn't very realistic. You can't do business in Venezuela, of any kind. The gov't does not respect contract law. Land, oil, assets, property of any kind is subject to seizure without any judicial review process. The gov't would be hostile to any business that tried to use bitcoin to circumvent their currency or capital controls. This is just a non-starter. At some point, the people of Venezuela have to realize that their gov't experiment simply isn't working, and replace it with hopefully a decent functioning democracy. That's going to take time and a lot more pain, given history.

'Hot Wallet Attacks'
That's really unfortunate to hear. I hope Coinapult resolves the issue without too much of a financial hit.
Hot wallets are a real challenge for any bitcoin business, because a hot wallet by definition is used to quickly and automatically send funds to a bitcoin address. The key words are 'quickly' and 'automatically'. That makes security very hard to guarantee.
A multi-sig wallet - as some erroneously suggest - is not a magic bullet that would secure hot wallets. There are a couple, but limited, edge-cases that multi-sig could protect a hot wallet against (like an inside job, hacking the hot wallet server, others), but anytime you automate the processing of outgoing transactions, you open a major security attack vector. A hot wallet attack could target a hot wallet and drain its funds long before anyone becomes wise to the attack.
Multi-sig could store a couple keys on two separate hot servers, for use in automation of transactions. Each server would have to individually 'agree' to the transaction and sign it for it to happen. A compromise of one server by an outside hacker or inside employee would prevent theft. A company would have to keep these servers physically separate (geo-distributed) and not give any one employee credentials to both. Problem is, geo-distribution adds latency, which itself hurts the 'quickly' goal of a hot wallet, though perhaps not too badly. 
There are a lot of risk vectors to consider when using a hot wallet, and I've definitely only touched on some here.
Coinsetter doesn't use hot wallets, hence no risk of any hot wallet attack to their exchange.
@_date: 2015-02-15 17:49:18

Trading Bitcoin is like trading any other asset/instrument. You have to know how to trade first and foremost.
If you believe that the asset has strong potential and you are willing to risk investing in it, then you can take a longer-term approach. 
But trading short-term is something you should do only if you know what you are doing.

There's a lot of talk among fervent bitcoin advocates about starting some kind of 'revolution' vis-a-vis the Federal Reserve system, banking, regulation, privacy, etc. That's all well and good. But do you and others just 'have an opinion' because you don't 'like' certain aspects of it or are you really willing to take direct and deliberate action toward bringing about some reform of the above systems? I mostly hear a lot of angry and empty talk by people who feel marginalized by the 'financial system' and nothing in the way of sober, mature action toward some ends. MLK and many others sacrificed their time, their money, and even their lives in the process of taking bold and wholesale action out in full view. They didn't sit in a basement and play guerilla games with the government, or naively think that buy running a site like Silk Road they were practicing a mature form of protest.
