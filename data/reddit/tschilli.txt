The problem is that you cant have 2 different wallets on the ledger nano s, so I have to move the coins out of the first hw wallet to some Desktop wallet or smth and then back to the new generated hw wallet

To point 5: use cash, not credit cards, as you will feed mastercard with data they will ''analyse' and sell...

If you have free electricity it would be more worth to buy graphics cards for a mining rig
