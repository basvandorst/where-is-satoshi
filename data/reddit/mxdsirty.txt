Bitcoins price is all about demand, and because it’s not a regulated currency, there is no inflation. People will adopt this currency mostly because of fomo, and the fact that as society adopts it, people will be willing to do the same. Although there will be people who will never adopt it and that’s fine. People use it to purchase goods, for reason as the transaction can’t be tracked. Other then that people use it as a normal currency because why not

Recommend you go for it, it can be very profitable if you maintain it well. Although they can be very expensive as you might already know, and always the threat of theft. Other then that go for it!
