$102 on BTC-E and $100 on Bitfinex a few days ago
$134 on Mtgox today
Bitstamp and BTC-E volume is also small compared to MtGox, so they are not very reliable indicators of the proper average price. Mtgox volume today is more than double the volume on Bitstamp and BTC-E combined.
The fact that those smaller exchanges are still trading at 5 to 6 times the price of Mtgox goes to show just how much further we have to go before this bubble is over.
Take a look at historic bubble charts, and youll see that the end has only just begun -we still have the long gruelling steady downtrend to go yet. What we are currently witnessing is the fear/panic stage, capitulation and depression is yet to come.

**Aaaaand it's gone.**
Mtgox down to $134
Bitstamp and BTC-E both in the $500 zone
I tried to warn you
I warned you that would be going to $200 or less before the price ever reaches $1242 again (if it ever does, which it likely won't). ~$100 has been recorded on three major exchanges now: Mtgox, BTC-E and Bitfinex.
So much for the 'buying opportunity', 'correction', 'dip', 'cheap coins', etc.
All bullshit, and it's likely Bitcoin will never see new highs again

Where is your source for that claim?
Because I'm looking at the volume for the time it was at $102, and it says ~7k bit coins were sold
Also if it was a glitch, why did it happen on Bitfinex at the same time too?
It sounds like you're in denial, but if you have evidence to support your claim, go ahead and present it
$592 is in the $500 zone, or would you say its in the $600 zone? And what about BTC-E, which is at $575 - that in the $600 zone too?
But don't worry, it'll be going down to $500 soon enough. That way we can both come to agreement on the terms used.
