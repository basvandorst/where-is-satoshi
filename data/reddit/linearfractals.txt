GeneralZex,  Very helpful information.. I'll certainly check it out.  BTW so DL is not required to purchase, only to  withdraw or cash out some BTC?.

No local sellers nearby and, again the online sellers all seem to be govt. agents working incognito... or charging "Way too much" if one uses Paypal (for example)...
In short Local bitcoin (appears to have been infiltrated)  at least in relation to  online payments and even the sellers who have low payment amounts set are still doing strong KYC.. which I would never agree to when dealing with an individual .

I've used a lot of wallets and I have never heard of the concept of backing up your funds.  What are you talking about?  This is an especially troublesome comment when you combine this with the advice of uninstalling then re-instaling one's wallet.  I'm guessing you mean having made a record of one's wallet recovery phrase= "having your funds backed up"

Thanks   but then what?

Kill the app?  How? and doesn't this affect the money i have in the wallet?

Thanks Paxful!  Just how does one send money into the "snakepit" and avoid having one's wallet be  venomously bitten?
