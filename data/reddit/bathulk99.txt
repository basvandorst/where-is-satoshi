Never buy near all time highs! expensive lesson you learned but it'll serve you well as you work to recover the loss.

You're lost 10% and don't care? I mean yeah lucky you for buying that low but you still lost 10% of value on your portfolio not caring just seems odd.

I say fuck HODL  because this sub parrots that constantly. Even in times when it is clear that the person should sell you guys say HODL. Blind faith in this coin is not something I support it may never recover and for me the risk isn't worth it so fuck HODL. Also this downturn is 50% down in the past month not somethi ng minor like you want to pretend it is

Exactly I trade stocks mostly and any jump of 10% in a small span is basically a signal to sell. These idiots don't know what they are doing.

That was savage and he probably needed to hear that

Easy to hold when you've bought that low some people bought at 19k and have been down for almost a month.

I wasn't day trading or timing the market I just saw a down turn and sold out fast. It's impossible to time the crypto market

Right here ��

So if it falls to $1 and you never sell you're still good with that right? Cause it's not really a loss right?

Np thanks I got out with all my money and a small profit when it began to tank and now can buy in again at over 3 grand cheaper of a price. Fuck HODL

Congrats man!!

Maybe wait for it to have a finished usable product before dumping into it? 
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:23:21
I would NEVER pay $5 per transaction are you nuts?! Who would be ok with that?
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:30:12
What choice do you have? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:05:01
You're a poet

Lol wise thing to do for things like the S&amp;P 500 ETFs not so much for BTC

Get out my man, I sold out for a small profit a while back and don't regret it one bit. We can buy again without losing money!
