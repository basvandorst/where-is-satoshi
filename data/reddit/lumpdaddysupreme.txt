Process took seconds. She gave me my total in bitcoins and I scanned the QR code and typed that number in. As soon as the unconfirmed transaction showed up on her screen I was done. It was fast. She knew exactly what to do. This place is relatively small so there is only one checkout.

Nope.  Paid and took my groceries home.

For those of you that are interested I'll try to breakdown how the process worked.  I bought my Bitcoins on Coinbase originally.  In order to spend them at Freshfully I created a wallet on the Blockchain.info website and downloaded their app to my iPhone.  Becoming verified on Coinbase and Blockchain.info took a few minutes but I think it was worth following all of their security protocols.  Once I had a Blockchain.info wallet I used the 'Send Money' feature on the Coinbase website to send money to my Blockchain.info wallet.     The funds showed up immediately and started getting confirmations.  
Now that I had some BTC in my iPhone wallet I went shopping.  Picked up some grass fed steaks, some bloody mary mix, granola, eggs, etc.  At checkout the cashier rang me up and gave me the total.  In the Blockchain.info app I hit the up arrow, put in the cost of the groceries, and selected the 'Scan from QR' button.  The cashier had a laptop up front which showed a QR code representing Freshfully's wallet.  I took a picture of that QR code with my phone and she said "Great, thanks for shopping with Freshfully."  
It was easier than I could have possibly imagined.  I will be buying my groceries at Freshfully exclusively now.

Yes, taxes were included in the final price.

This picture was taken in late December.  I bought $70 worth of groceries which was 0.1171 BTC at the time.  I went shopping today and bought $225 worth of groceries at the same store and spent 0.2485 BTC.  The owner saves money on transaction fees so she loves it.  I like BTC because it makes me feel like I am truly in control of my money.
