Guess he is trying to say it's not a relational database, like SQL.

Bitcoiners just getting up and disappearing like that usually has a reason to. Lock your doors, heh. Either he's now rich, or rich + wanted dead or alive.

PGP was classified as a weapon at first. he is right.

I think gambling and investing is the same, but diversifying your funds makes you a little less gambler :)

I've been wondering why they don't fix the connection issues with the client. I like to have my client open all the time. But apparently the accepted solution is just to keep restarting it when it happens, or only use it when you absolutely need to. (I'm using 1.9.8)

heh some guy sent, what was it, 800btc to gox last week.

This is it, I think. I think what we are seeing now are a hidden bear attack, falling in line with the Gox recline. I expect massive buyups pretty soon. As far as I am concerned, the US IRS just gave the go for Bitcoin. Expect bulls very soon.

Everyone knoew MtGox could be exploited.  So, not incompetence but negligence. Which is a crime.

AFAIK, you can rent hackers that takes over a Twitter account for you. But I also came to the thread to see if wallet servers or source code was compromised as well. Maybe someone got access to a bunch of passwords. Hopefully, this involves only the Twitter account.

This is not what you wants to hear after getting Goxxed one time already. Yo dawg...

Because they want cheap coins! FUD working as intended, it seems.

When some of the TX fees trickles on the nodes, maybe I'll do it. Miners will mine no matter what, and the TX fees are minuscule compared to mining rewards. I don't see why the miners should get all the fees.

There are really not too many bitcoins. lets just keep them and let the burning happen by accident over the years. this sounds like s scheme of some sort.
@_date: 2014-08-23 12:32:01
I talked to my fahter about bitcoins, and he said it was not good, because some american people in the 1940's (after ww2) decided that dollar was the best coin ever and should remain so.
