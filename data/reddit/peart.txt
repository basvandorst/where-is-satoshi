" I guess they have never thought how long it takes to download about 54+ GiB over 8 shitty connections."

yeah for YOU. Not for most people

Because the point he's making is the time it takes to download not the size.

If you want to really throw a monkey wrench into this bitcoin nonsense earn (or control) as many bitcoins in the market as you can, then massively sell off undercutting everyone.

Monopolies and Anti-Trust laws. Plus there are tons of consumer protection regarding stock tickers, market hours, limits on orders, and not to mention you cannot buy stocks, bonds, and securities with credit cards. Markets close on the evening to prevent runs and other things that would take advantage of a 24 hour market. Money (fiat or otherwise) has bank protections. If a bank is robbed the money is insured. Not so with bitcoin. And unless everyone down the supply chain takes bitcoin it is useless

Watch the bubble burst. Confidence will collapse the average casual (ie the majority) investor will pull out.

Sell them off all at once driving the price down then rebuy at the lower price.  Keep doing this until you have more bitcoins.  Then sell off entirely.  You care about making money not bitcoins.  But if I were you.  I'd sell off at a premium to a private buyer (in cash) then hopefully he sells them all off not knowing what he's doing then rebuy your bitcoins back at the lower price.

Special pleading.  Slippery slope. What you're suggesting is that people will barter for food.  Money though fiat is a far better store of wealth than fucking barter or the bitcoin.  Do you seriously think america will have an armed militia against itself?  That's absurd.  America's army isn't conscripted, it is a volunteer civilian army.  Good luck trying to get the military to take over when you can't even pay them.  This is why the USD failing is an absurd notion.

China isn't.  Who do you think it's their latest trade partner?  any country that wants to go back to valuing money in magic such as gold is going to fail.  gold isn't scarce it isn't a magic store of wealth it's value is as arbitrary as the dollar or the bit coin and it is a good thing we are off of the gold standard
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:31:54
What would happen hypothetically if you lost your investment?
@_date: 2013-11-17 17:01:22
There were no dire consequences of replacing the gold standard with fiat because fiat is backed up by force.  Why on earth would you think that is worse than having an arbitrary metal back up your currency?  If we're going to back up currency by an arbitrary commodity energy is a much better alternative not gold.  You say "fiat" if it were a dirty word.  It isn't.

What makes you an expert in finances Mr. Genuis?  BTW they're the experts not you.  You have a serious insecurity problem.  And a misplaced desire to be somebody.  Remove the hype from bitcoin and look at how the market opperates.  Unregulated exchange houses with price variances among them.   No liquidity for them to pay off their customers if there is a run on the market.  Their assets aren't diversified.  And you're going to trust them with ALL of your money?  Tsk Tsk.  Someone here is stupid and doesn't get it, and it isn't the financial advisors.

if the dollar collapses who will feed the world?  do you know who does that now? 
@_date: 2013-11-17 21:22:29
That's not arbitrary.  And the financial crisis was in large part due to mucking around in sub prime mortgages which led to speculation in financial derivatives based on those sub prime mortgages.  Partially due to lower and middle class people naively believing that home ownership is the key to wealth and a future.  Sounds familiar doesn't it?  I don't know if anyone will come along and create a future and or option contract based derivative on the bitcoin.  But if they do they'll rake it in.

There we go gamble in the housing markret too.  BTW.  If you have had run businesses what you should of done is pay off the mortage on the house rented out the house for passive income.  BTW I know you don't know this but passive income is taxed at a lower rate than active income.  Fuck my brother sells franchises starting at 40,000.  So much you could of done with your money yet so little brains to know what to do.

Yeah but would you want to talk to her?

You're SOL.  But that's what you get when you dabble in an unregulated market.

Open is what the price is when the day opened.  High is that day's highest price.  Low is that day's lowest price.  Close mean the price at the end of the day.

It isn't unique to bitcoin.  But it is unique to unregulated markets which is bitcoin.

What you're doing is gambling.  And I hope your sister finds a good lawyer after she reads what you posted because she has a good cause for malfesense on your part.  Would you invest in Microsoft if you knew that the price flucuates as much on a daily basis?  You obviously were looking to get rich quick.  And too stupid to realise you already were richer than most people.  BTW did you even consider most of the exchanges probably don't have the liquidity to pay you out?  What about capital gains taxes?  What about inheretence taxes?  Did you set up a business plan when you began to invest?  Or did you seriously think it would just work itself out.     Did you consider that  bitcoin might be a fad primarily driven by inexperienced 20 somethings with no history of investing?  What about the fact that these exchanges have no regulations and could quite possibly take your money, manipulate the market, plus a whole host of other things that could happen.  I bet you didn't even know regular online brokerage houses are subject to regulations like real time quotes and other regulations on the algorithms used to display prices.   Hopefully your sister and or your familly is smart and sides against you.  What will happen is you're going to have a hard time extracting your money and you'll end  up losing most of it.  Have fun squandering your parents hard work.

gold's value is arbitrary.  gold isn't magical store of wealth.  it is a good thing every major county got off the gold standard.   btw gold isn't scarce or rare

You need advice on having a brain.  BTW genius did you know that in most states to be a certified counseler you have to have masters degree or better?  Running a business and a successful business is two different things.  I technically am a business owner since when I applied for my EIN (do you know what that even means?) But since I never have used it I am by default an unseccessfull business owner.  But you dig that hole deeper. You go girl.
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:03:25
and if bitcoin tanks?  If you can say for certain that it won't then why aren't you better at predicting the market?

Actually the parts in the brain that deal with heroin abuse and gambling (and all other addictions) is the same.

special pleading.  post hoc fallacy and argument from ignorance
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:57:56
argument from ignorance, appeal to popularity, argument from personal incregulity, argument from authority, post hoc ergo propter hoc, and moving the goal posts.  any other ones you want to add?
