This is not her retirement money. She has retirement funds elsewhere. This was something she got for free &amp; would like to do something nice for herself. And people around here apparently just can't stand to here about anyone cashing out without critiquing it? When people lose coins or take a loss, we send our condolences.

No, doesn't work because regardless of whether you disclose that you're an MSB or not, they will close your account simply for having large regular cash deposits. No questions asked. They don't care if you can justify the cash deposits or not. The large cash deposits simply represent too large of a risk for them. Trust me, I've been doing this for 6 years, I have worked just about every angle you can work and every account gets shut down. Thank the Bank Secrecy Act &amp; The Patriot Act.
@_date: 2019-07-21 07:05:37
100%, These accounts will not last. Trust me on ths, I've been dealing with banking issues for 6 years. Makes no difference that you disclosed the nature of your business. I am very shocked that they allowed you to have an account in the first place as an msb, but I'll take you word on that part of it. The reality of the situation is that the moment you start depositing any significant amount of cash on a regular basis you're toast. Once their internal flags get set off &amp; the Risk Management department takes a closer look it's all over. Risk Management is the Grim Reaper for bank accounts. Their decision is final &amp; unreviewable. They will close your account regardless of whether you're an MSB or not.
After 9/11 &amp; the Patriot act, banks will not go anywhere near a business that makes large cash deposits. They won't even ask you for your side of it or warn you in any way, either. You just receive a letter saying your account is being closed &amp; the decision is final with no chance to dispute. I call it "the break up letter." I've had many break ups.

As a rule I typically don't advise people to sell or hodl. I did make an exception when she wanted to sell it at 5k about a year ago. I advised against it. But most of the time I simply don't like to influence someone's decision because if they take my advice &amp; I'm wrong I'll feel terrible. Seriously, who tf am I? I'm not an analyst or chart reader. Just being involved in bitcoin since 2013 doesn't make me an expert by any stretch.
@_date: 2019-07-13 23:20:55
Consider this, that I didn't consider before attempting this. Don't underestimate people's brazenness. Scammers will fully verify &amp; provide ID gambling that the likelihood that you will pursue them in small claims court is small. And the fact is, they're right. Do you want to spend all your time in this new venture constantly chasing people down over a few hundred dollars? I discovered the reality of this &amp; promptly stopped accepting online payment methods.
@_date: 2019-07-16 07:01:41
I don't make it a habit of shoving my hobbies down the throats of disinterested people. I gave her the Bitcoin because I believed the value would appreciate, not because I expected her to adopt my interest in it. She has hobbies &amp; interests of her own &amp; with as much as I talked bitcoin around her &amp; the rest of my family if she wanted to know more she knew where to find me.
@_date: 2019-07-16 06:34:57
You say this as if it's a guarantee when it's not. I agree with the sentiment that the outlook for bitcoin is very promising, but making declarative statements like this is dangerous.

Yes. It will only take 2-3 chargebacks or fraud claims before paypal closes your account.
@_date: 2019-07-16 06:54:19
Depends. Sounds like you might think they are connected to a bank account of some kind because they are called "ATM's". They are not. They allow people to buy/sell bitcoin &amp; receive it instantly without the wait or extensive on boarding that you'd get with coinbase or an exchange, and without the perceived risk of meeting a stranger in a coffee shop. Also to buy/sell if you don't have a bank account at all. People often take for granted that they can easily get a bank account. Many people cannot.
@_date: 2019-07-15 20:13:43
I guess I always viewed this saying as not going broke on that one trade. All bets are off on future decisions.
@_date: 2019-07-16 08:22:59
Literally no one is telling you that you have to believe in bitcoin or its future. Bitcoin is opt-in. Did you really just drop in to shout your disapproval to a group of people that weren't bothering you &amp; didn't even know you existed until you threw your tantrum in front of everyone?
@_date: 2019-07-15 18:26:55
I like this answer. She wanted to sell at 5k a year ago or so &amp; I talked her out of it. I had thoughts of trying to talk her out of it again, but 20x is a darn good roi so I decided to just be happy for her, even if we moon.
@_date: 2019-07-15 18:20:22
She doesn't follow bitcoin. She sees a 20x return which is insane by all other standards so there's nothing wrong with taking profits in my opinion.
@_date: 2019-07-15 22:41:12
She did not learn more about bitcoin when I gave it to her.
I see a lot of people projecting their thoughts on how they think she should be more bitcoin and/or investing savvy, but people have to realize she's a mom with a family &amp; a busy life. She has her own interests &amp; hobbies &amp; wouldn't know anything about bitcoin if she didn't have me around incessantly talking about it. I gave her the Bitcoin &amp; thrust her into being a Crypto owner. The idea that that should obligate her to take up an interest in bitcoin or investing is absurd.
@_date: 2019-07-15 19:48:01
I have a Bitcoin business. I made sure she secured it.
@_date: 2019-07-16 08:35:58
I see a common theme that people tend to project their interest in Crypto &amp; think that everyone we introduce it to should instantly adopt our excitement. I think that's an unrealistic expectation.
@_date: 2019-07-15 21:00:05
I'm buying it from her so it will be MEEEEE!
@_date: 2019-07-13 23:28:31
This is not always the case. You're basing your calculation on the idea that ATM providers can get their supply of bitcoin at market price or lower. I am a provider and I have to pay above market for most of my supply. After that &amp; all other overhead, my net margin is not anywhere near what reddit users think it is.
@_date: 2019-07-15 19:28:24
Are you implying she, someone who knows very little about Crypto, should have somehow known that 19k was the top? Why ask why she didn't sell at 19k? Why not 17k, or 14k? These posts about "why didn't you sell at the top?" baffle me. You don't know it's the top when you're at that moment. You don't even know it as it continues to drop. It could reverse any moment. You only know it was the top now because it's 18 months later. You ever try to time a top? I'm guessing not.

@_date: 2019-07-16 05:35:36
That's a common sentiment. Yes I'm in business to make money so I do alright but the margins are not what people think. Many operators (including me) can't get bank accounts so we have to source all of our supply with cash in person trades. No option to use an exchange &amp; buy at spot price so I often pay above spot from anywhere I can find it. Include overhead after that &amp; my net is nowhere near what most people assume.
@_date: 2019-07-16 07:22:31
While I understand what you're getting at, I have to assume she's been playing this what if game in her head for 6 years. How far/long do you continue that when you know as little about bitcoin as she does? She rode the highs and lows, she picked her spot. For better or worse she'll have to live with it &amp; I respect her fortitude in not panic selling in 2018.

I'm a hodler so don't get me wrong, but literally NO investment is without risk. Your comments hover very close to promises of guaranteed growth. Bitcoin moon is not guaranteed, so being someone who doesn't follow bitcoin, her decision is completely rational.

He bought bitcoin. The receiver doesn't pay the miner fee the sender does. ATM operators don't typically pass that &lt;$1 fee on to the customer. At least I dont.
@_date: 2019-04-23 07:22:49
ATM operator here. I can't speak for other operators but my 12-13% rates are anything but predatory. You have to realize that there are a lot of factors that come into play that most users don't think about.
1. Most ATM operators cannot get bank accounts &amp; therefore cannot gets their btc supply at spot price on an exchange. I sometimes pay 2-3% above spot simply because I have to find otc sellers that will accept large amounts of physical cash in exchange for bitcoin.
2. The cost of paying the hosts, vendors &amp; services is another few % so that can get you to 5-6% overhead in a hurry. And if you have employees, the margins get even thinner. 
3. I've tested lower fees below 10% &amp; when I do, the ATM volume quickly burns through my supply before I can reacquire more coin. Running out of coin is about the worst thing you can do as an operator, from a customer experience standpoint. People that drive to your ATM only to find its out of coin are potentially lost customers for life.
Therefore, 12% or higher is necessary in order to keep my ATM's from constantly running out of bitcoin. They still do significant volume at that rate so it hardly seems predatory. 
Again I can't speak for other operators but for me my rates are a function of supply, demand &amp; overhead. Nothing more. Selling at under 10% would either put me out of business or make my profit so little that it wouldn't be worth the time &amp; energy I put into running the business.

I think you missed a very important point. Why is it that you assume I, or anyone with the banking issues I have as a Bitcoin business, can just snap my fingers &amp; get any amount of supply that I desire? I can't.
I am in competition with at least 5 other atm providers in my city and I get nearly daily feedback on how appreciative my customers are. It's because my competitors' machines are always either out of cash, out of bitcoin, or both.
I don't run out of cash, and I don't run out of bitcoin. And my customers are loyal because they know this.
I wish you the best in your atm venture. I've been in Bitcoin since 2013 &amp; the philosophy is just as important to me as profit. We are all on the same team.
@_date: 2019-05-04 00:58:39
I have many locations and they are all doing very well. Anytime I've experimented with fees under 10% my Supply of Bitcoin is drained faster than I can reacquire it. So I have to adhere to the laws of supply and demand. Running out of Bitcoin would be extremely bad for business so I can't allow that to happen, and the only way to prevent that is to keep prices at a rate that doesn't burn through my Supply faster than I can re-up. If I were to do what you're suggesting and keep my fees artificially low out of principle, it would lead to a bad customer experience because I'm wasting customers time when they show up to my ATM and it is out of coin. Not to mention many of those will be lost customers for life because they'll view my ATMs as unreliable.

ATM operator here. Not all operators are charging 10+% percent just because they can. Have you ever considered that maybe not all of us can get the very high volume of consistent supply that we need at spot price? That is the case with me. I have to pay up to 4% sometimes because I simply can't find supply in the volume I need at spot. Also, there are a multitude of things that can cause one operator's overhead to be much different than others. You're assuming every operator's internal economics is exactly like your own, which is extremely naive.
