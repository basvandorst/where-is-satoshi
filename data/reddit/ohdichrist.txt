From coinbase FAQ:
Bitcoin Segwit2x does not have any built-in replay protection, but Coinbase has implemented our own replay protection system. You can safely send any BTC or B2X from Coinbase without worrying about replays on the other chain.

Correct. But if you have your coins stored on a Trezor, if you move your Legacy coins to a different address, your 2X coins will be moved as well because they haven't implemented their own replay protection, while coinbase HAS

Well if you want to understand my motives, I invested my rock band's savings into bitcoin, and then plan on selling it at the higher inflated prices as a result of the forks.
Then I'm going to hold the bitcoin gold and segwit 2x coins and sell when i think they are peaking so we can profit.
Trying to save the music video man lol. Gotta drop 6.5k.
You best believe I have my own personal funds secured in my trezor that will be HODL until the end of time. I dont plan on selling them

Ledger Nano S has integrated replay protection as well! Other than that, id have to do my research
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:26:14
Well you still have to pay a fee to buy and sell. Not sure if GDAX will support it. If so I will be transferring it to my GDAX account to sell for no fees

Well here's my reasoning:
I watched a video on Ivan on Tech explaining how-to decouple your coins by sending a small amount as a seperate output to 3Bit1xA4apyzgmFNT2k8Pvnd6zb6TnwcTi
Now in this video here, he is saying that segwit 2x developers have gotten rid of replay protection entirely because it created a security risk if they want to implement the lightning network in the future
(8:30 in video)
So now the only option I seem to have is leaving my coins on coinbase so I can use my tokens separately. I can't seem to find much about the subject on Google so not sure what to do

No worries!
And if your Legacy coin is stored on anything other than a wallet that explicitly states they have integrated their own replay protection, then your coins will be vulnerable during a transaction.
So yes your coins are subject to a replay attack on a paper wallet

Pretty crazy huh...lol. Who would've thought? The political agenda of trezor is making it hard for people to do what they want with their coins.
Ledger Nano S is good though. No need to transfer to an exchange if you have that.

I do bank wires every 2 weeks to my coinbase account at PNC. They never question it. When they ask for a reason, I say "investment". They like me there. This nice hispanic lady always does the transfers for ME ����
