Well I got a call from the team that set up a series of meetings that ended up becoming a full time ride. But as far as the bitcoin goes it was something that was brought to us by a group of people. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 23:25:40

@_date: 2014-08-05 22:45:40
Well I think Kyle Larson has done an awesome job, but I'd love to be in comparable equipment ;)
And I think there are too many to name, but I think ross chastain deserves a legit shot
@_date: 2014-08-06 00:00:56
Thanks for all the questions and support! This bitcoin campaign is exciting to me and we would love to make it happen. This community is pretty amazing and bringing a new audience to Bitcoin companies, the technology and the currency would be great.
If you have any other questions, feel free to keep asking questions or PM me and I'll answer them. This has been fun!!  
@_date: 2014-08-05 22:16:18

@_date: 2014-08-05 23:51:34

Probably my first USAC midget win, I had been driving for a big team and left and built my own car in my garage with the help of my dad, and we won the first night out.

mk4 supra built 2j single turbo drift car... Heaven on earth
@_date: 2014-08-05 22:13:56
To be honest it was something that was brought to us, not something we looked for. But with the struggle of finding sponsorship to make the team better we've got to take every opportunity we can. So that's what we're doing. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 23:40:39
did that all the time. I'm the guy to turn around and go backwards
@_date: 2014-08-05 22:20:32
one, two, dale, four....
Haha I mean I was a big sprintcar and midget fan growing up so I really liked watching guys like Ron Shuman and Lelan Mcspaden race. But as far as household names that I would call heroes I'd say guys like Dale Sr, Davey Alison, and Tim Richmond... Bc that guy knows how to party...
@_date: 2014-08-05 23:19:03
a little but Im lazier than I should. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 23:08:24
agree. Rick booby will not stand a chance
@_date: 2014-08-05 23:55:21
I'm not sure he knows how to ruin anything ;O
@_date: 2014-08-05 22:11:54
can I have three choices? Indianapolis raceway park, Salem speedway, and Irwindale speedway. they're the most fun tracks in the country in my opinion.
@_date: 2014-08-05 23:13:33
my usac stuff was always really cool. but some of my nationwide cars were really cool too
@_date: 2014-08-05 22:39:17
I mean we're all learning. Even the veterans. And there are enough veterans I can go to for advice that It hasn't hurt us at all.
@_date: 2014-08-05 23:04:27
jay leno and we'd race for pinks because hes got a ton of cool stuff haha
@_date: 2014-08-05 23:01:58
it just takes time. But the big teams are solid enough they're not going anywhere
@_date: 2014-08-05 23:56:00
haha may do that!!!
