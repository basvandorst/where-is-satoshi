He earned the money through hard work and effort but his books are number one sellers on Amazon I don't see how he could need the money!

Agreed: If he turns CNBC down they may shun him "Andreas was invited to join us in New York but refused."

I think that your point is valid but it may confuse people.  
If someone holds 1 billion worth of coin they will not exit all at once.  They should sell slowly into an upswing as long as the volume is sufficient to absorb the selling.
If someone has 1 billion US cash dollars in North Korea they can't access the value immediately.  They have to ship/fly the money to the USA, try to find a buyer who wants to trade yuan(or bitcoin) for US dollars or slowly change it at cash exchanges while crossing the border with China.  In Russia they probably have similar challenges.
Andreas Antonopoulos had a talk where he pointed out that during the banking problems in India bitcoin had a significant premium over the Rupee.
Bitcoin is worth what you think it is worth (What are you willing to pay/risk to have $1,000 dollars of present value stored in a key you remember).  People probably bought in 2013 because they either wanted to own a cool new financial technology, they wanted to store value in a cryptocurrency or they were speculating that in time people would realize its true value.
