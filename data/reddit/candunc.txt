But if people like Coinbase aren't using Segwit, and thus we have a transaction backlog, what's the point of it?

Spamming the mempool? I guarantee the majority of those are valid transactions, and besides, even with 8 MB blocks Bitcoin Cash blocks [aren't full of "spam" transactions](

For point 3 miners are already somewhat centralized, IIRC many of the big pools use a backbone (Maybe [bitcoinfibre?]( to get block updates as fast as possible. Miners who are excluded from the backbone are disadvantaged already.
Also, according to [this image]( [posted earlier]( even 32 MB blocks take ~6 seconds. The resource consumption (HDD, RAM) is a much more likely factor to impact those running full nodes (Like Raspberry Pis), but hey, transaction fees are so high if you can't afford more than an RPI, you can't afford to use Bitcoin Core.

Bitcoin Cash doesn't have the transaction backlog that Bitcoin does, and Bitcoin _really_ needs a short term solution with 170,000+ unconfirmed transactions. It is unusable as an internet currency, is it not? Cash/Fiat would be faster and cheaper at this rate.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:51:51
Only reason? Not the fact that Core has artificially restricted the blocksize to 1 MB?

So, because I don't have an investment in Bitcoin, I no longer get a say? You are ignoring the fact that I was an adopter years ago, who mined and profited from both Bitcoin and altcoins?
The whole point of the Bitcoin Unlimited fork is that the majority of the hashing power will immediately swap to a new chain, forcing the minority to rejoin the consensus. The difficulty curve will force everyone on the core chain to either switch, or to perish in vain of their shorter chain.
Here is an excerpt of a removed comment from this subreddit:

I do understand Divide &amp; Conquer, but there is no conqueror in these terms. We are split literally [50-50]( when it comes to blocks signaling support.
The actual Bitcoin community is split, Core &amp; Unlimited are both sides. Being split doesn't allow a third coin to topple (conquer) bitcoin, it's just a political debate.

trusted third  parties  to process electronic payments.
So, are you arguing the vision of the bitcoin whitepaper is to scale the chain via third parties, when literally the first sentence criticizes that vision?

How else will we discover bugs? It's a shame this wasn't caught in testing, however it was rare and complicated enough it took almost two months to be found.

I didn't mean to put words into your mouth, but the first paragraph (and sentence) of the white paper criticizes trust based models for internet transactions. Am I wrong in thinking that the lightning network is a trust-based measure using bitcoin as leverage, while the bitcoin chain is supposed to be the cryptographic proof for _all_ transactions?
My story? I'm a student who has dabbled in bitcoin for a while. I see it as currency, again how it was described in the whitepaper. I've mined altcoins and payed off my mining equipment. I've run Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited nodes in the past, and I'm against censorship, better or worse.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:29:00
Well yea, because every time I spin up a public Bitcoin Cash node people DDoS me. I don't even run a public Bitcoin Core node because of this.

There isn't FUD, nor attacks on the mempool. The number of transactions on the bitcoin network has fallen as people have been moving to other cryptocurrencies. The low transaction price is a direct result of high transaction prices that forced people off the network.
See [this chart]( transactions has fallen quite a bit since May.

How is fiat "worthless"? The entire economy of every country is valued in their local fiat currency.

I think the main thing with ETC is they want decentralized power. Proof-of-Stake relies on larger wallets, which is inherently centralized. I would assume they would stay with Proof of Work to keep the miners happy, and to keep things decentralized.
@_date: 2016-07-26 20:30:46
Poloniex did not confiscate any coins. They retroactively gave everyone the proper balance after splitting the wallet into the two forks. I got the amount of ETC equivalent to the liquid ETH I had.
