That's statist spelling. Libertarians don't have to abide by your rules.

Many people have and have not been shut down. You haven't heard about them because they aren't that popular because it's hard to get people to buy into the idea (particular those who have to purchase goods from outside the community and thus can't use MagicDollars). But, it does happen.

What they are missing is that the people at the top of the next system are likely to be those at or near the top of the current one (see: Winklevoss).
Revolutions shuffle the people at the top, but those at the bottom tend to stay there.

Can't it be *both* fraud and a contract violation?

Your point?
When I deposit money with a bank I agree to their terms and conditions. Banks also have to have an amount in reserve specified by law. Neither of these apply to MtGox.

Why would it solve this? There were plenty of wars between nations that were on the gold standard (or any form of commodity money).

We didn't invent war in the 20th century. Wars have been around for millennia and have been paid for by various means and countries were generally on some form of a gold standard then. Soldiers were often expected to live off the land and take what they could carry as the spoils of war (which probably made wars even nastier, to be honest).
Europe's history is essentially one long list of wars. Wars of conquest, religion, succession, and whatever you'd call it when you invade a country because you owe it a lot of money and can't pay the debts. The 20th century is actually looking pretty good by comparison.

House prices today are about even with 2008 prices. Obviously this depends on location, but according to Zillow (yeah, I know, but it's the first site I found that didn't charge me for data), the median home price in the US in January 2008 was $189K and in December 2014 it was $179K.

There is. It's happened. When Washington Mutual went under, many people lost money. I *personally* know people who had money in their accounts above the FDIC limit (because they were getting 0.0000001% more on some stupid savings account) and they *lost* that money. Bye-bye. These were not stupid people. They were educated, they know about bank runs, they'd seen *It's a Wonderful Life* about a million times, they could name the Kings of England and quote the fights historical from Marathon to Waterloo in order categorical.
If we have learned one thing from history it's that we don't seem to learn anything from history.

In general, it is.
I have to have insurance on my house because the people who actually own my house (i.e. the mortgage holders) require it. When I pay them off in 70 squintillion years, I can let the insurance lapse.
FDIC insurance is not mandated federally (although most states require it. Because banks went under and lost money and people were pissed) and credit unions, for example, are not FDIC insured (they have their own version of it. Because customers like it). Not all your accounts at your local bank will be insured and even the ones that are are only insured up to a certain amount.
Look, if you really want to put money into something that is relatively liquid and isn't insured, you can find it. The fact that most of the *convenient* ways of doing this are all insured is just a reflection of what the market (sometimes reflected through the state government) wants.

Why not?
Okay, it wouldn't work exactly like FDIC, but there is nothing stopping you (or me) from starting a BitCoin insurance business. Presumably (?) we'd have to own enough BitCoins personally to make good on any potential claims or some percentage thereof (capital requirements, common to all insurance companies). Obviously I can't make BitCoins out of thin air to meet the claims, but private insurance companies can't do that either with USD.
So, there probably can't be *federal* deposit insurance for BitCoin banks, but there can certainly be *private* deposit insurance.

Could be worse. You could have invested money in twitter stock.

No, it's insurance.
I have insurance on my house. That doesn't mean that my house only exists as a bookkeeping entry.
Fundamentally, there is no reason why someone couldn't offer bitcoin insurance, and then bitcoin losses through theft could be replaced by a keystroke. At which point the bitcoin fans would say "Hah! See! We have insurance, just like regular money in banks" and they would forget that that was ever supposed to be a bad thing.
