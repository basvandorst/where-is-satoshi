It’s all fun and games except in my case Coinbase shows me “buying” over 35k worth of bitcoin in one of those years, which is absurd. I was so excited about cryptocurrencies back then I was moving bitcoin through alts like a shit through a goose, and every time a “new” bitcoin showed up back on Coinbase they treat it as new income. I lost money that year and yet I’m afraid the IRS won’t understand that no, I really didn’t control the private keys to all that bitcoin, at least, not at the same time. It’s like they don’t understand how liquid this technology is. Oh yeah, because they don’t treat it like a fucking currency. It might act like more of a commodity at times, but several years ago it was very much a currency.

While it’s no less maddening, it helps to know that I’m not alone in this. Using FIFO, Coinbase has wildly exaggerated my income, putting me on this stupid list. Coinbase is making billions off of us. Let them foot the goddamned lawyer fees.

The whole point of cryptocurrencies is that I don’t have to trust an intermediary, such as yourself, should I choose to send money for charity or disaster relief...or for whatever.
@_date: 2017-10-03 02:43:09
You realize how easy it is to trace your hot wallet to your cold wallet? I’m guessing your cold wallet is filled with BTC that came straight from an exchange? Then you moved a small amount to your hot wallet, which you then spent online or IRL. If you spent it online then your name and address will be attached to the transaction. C’mon man.

Yes.

I’m sorry your feelings were hurt. Maybe I was triggered by you assuming I am an idiot. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 03:12:27
Congratulations? Don’t get me wrong, that’s awesome. Shows me that bitcoin is working again.
@_date: 2017-10-03 02:26:26
Yes, for the most part. You have to work very hard to hide how much BTC you own. And if you’re not careful it’s trivial to track how much you own, where it came from, how much that person or business owned, and on and on. 
Hold your money in Bitcoin. Spend it with Monero. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 02:46:42
They would still owe taxes. Edit: please don’t think I’m stupid enough to believe any gov agency would pay taxes. I just think it’s a lil hypocritical that they would put me in jail for doing the exact same thing they did. 
Draper will owe capital gains tax when(if) he sells his massive stash of coins.

For sure. Probably the most hassle free way to buy bitcoin in the US. You can also buy Ethereum and Litecoin with them too. Just remember to move all your coins off of Coinbase to a wallet that you control your private keys. Ledger Nano S is my favorite and it’s one of the most secure ways to hold cryptocurrencies. But there are many wallets. Research them carefully before you commit. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:38:31
Maybe next year I’ll try this with Monero :)

I remember being scared to buy .2btc back in Feb 2015 when one coin was trading for $220. But then I became obsessed and couldn’t stop dumping my paychecks into it :)
I doubt you mind all that much, but just from showing the exact time and amount and a couple other details it wouldn’t be terribly hard for someone to find that transaction and address.

Article fails to mention that the Europol report clearly states that there are no known references to Zcash in any criminal investigation. They only include it because AlphaBay claimed that they would implement it in the future.

I have a few T-shirts that I look at and think “what a waste of bitcoin” but fuck it, I’m 99% in cryptocurrencies so I have to spend it every day to live.
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:49:02
Haha you get used to it! Hopefully you’re young enough that losing everything won’t ruin your life or the lives of your family. 
I’ve squirreled away enough physical assets that I’ll be okay if Bitcoin or Monero goes to zero. I’d advise you do the same.

Considering your post history, I’m guessing you feel like the woman being stabbed?

Well, considering that I recommend a buy and hold strategy, I’d say buy 100% bitcoin through which ever exchange is easiest for you, have already purchased a Ledger Nano S hardware wallet, and then split your bitcoin into a basket of alts in the percentages you desire via shapeshift.io (use a vpn or Tor to at least keep your IP address out of their logs). The Ledger will hold all of the coins I suggested except for Monero, but that integration should be happening soon^tm. 
If you’re concerned about privacy buy your bitcoin locally via atm or localbitcoins.com (that’s the URL, right?) I wouldn’t know. I bought all of my coins years ago.  
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:36:30
As much as I could afford :)

I switched everything over to segwit addresses the first day it was available. Lower fees, for starts. Every segwit transaction I’ve created made it into the first block always with a fee under $1.

Now that I think about it, issuing paper notes that could be redeemed for physical gold was an absolutely insane idea. 
But yeah, to your question, Bitcoin shares nothing in common with gold except that gold is vaguely “scarce” and is mined at a more or less predictable rate. [Gold was an easy, tangible way, to help people understand bitcoin years ago. I think it’s probably time we move on from this way of thinking.]
If you don’t want to reproduce the same problems that the gold standard had...then...don’t?

Yup, I remember that very well. He’s made a massive amount of money thanks to the government. I first bought Bitcoin when it was trading for ~$200 and people were making fun of Draper for buying it up at around $600 like you say. Who’s laughing now?
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:06:52
You...should...try harder next time. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:54:57
I remember very happily buying the fucking dip. Thanks Mike!
@_date: 2017-10-06 05:29:44
Buy a basket of coins, with bitcoin being your highest percentage of holdings, then Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero, (and that shitcoin DASH only because it’s so easily manipulated and has good returns) in whatever percentages you feel comfortable with—and store them securely for at least a year. Live life, drink beer, get married and divorced. Come back in a year and see how much money you’ve made. Or maybe that was just me last year? 
Don’t day trade unless you’re brilliant aka don’t day trade.

Without bitcoin, I would still be a cashier at a small co-op grocery store making $10 an hour. Now I work at home full time trading crypto. I am almost completely debt free. It took me years to build that foundation, but bitcoin was the first thing to give me hope that I could even dig myself out.

Trezor has an awesome password manager, highly secure bitcoin wallet, and does 2 factor authentication for sites that support it. It's expensive, but imo it's very much worth it. All of my passwords are random. Even I don't know them.

I did. I invested (admittedly, pathetically small sums of money) in stocks, ETFs, and mutual funds. Everything from clean energy to cyber security. I lost most of my pathetically small sum of money. I started buying bitcoin in Feb 2015 when it was trading for ~$220. It comes down to ROI.
