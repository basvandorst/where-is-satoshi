Gotcha, I was using the card to withdraw.

Call you see if your account was terminated. This happened to me and the masses by Bitpay's card issuer. No explanation whatsoever.

Confirmed awesome! 
@_date: 2018-08-19 22:58:46

@_date: 2018-08-19 23:08:40

who gives a fuck, I download 3 wallets and I can't send a fucking payment to Bitpay, I guess it was meant to be...

Try sending in smaller batches, some ISP's block bulk emails for spam reasons.

Check Twitter, there's a tweet going around saying the coinomi wallet sends your seed to the Google spell check API.

Your seed is not safe in a bank. Get the Trezor T, write down the 12 words. Add a 13th word, memorize the 13 words. (don't write down 13th word) Trezor T is the only device (to my knowledge) that you type the 13th word on the device itself, not the computer.

this is really good, but I need a little help using it. I want to create a 12 word seed w/passphrase for use with Ledger.. It selects BIP44 by default, should I be using BIP39??? Also for coin it defaults to BTC. will this be OK for all the coins Ledger supports??

I have a wallet, but I mean if a person is in a different state and wants to pay with credit card. This is for someone that knows nothing about crypto except how to use a credit card.

Thx, let me research this. 
@_date: 2018-07-18 17:13:21
It seems Electrum does not allow you to add a passphrase? What am I missing...???

For  you should probably add e) Every 3 minutes

A week, hahaha. I've had my account for just over a year and still takes me three weeks to get my BTC. What gives coinbase? 
@_date: 2018-12-26 04:16:27
Withdraw to a bank account from pro.coinbase does not take long. Every time I did a withdraw I had the money in my account by the next day.

Add me to the list of closed accounts. This is nice to know, especially after loading my wallet. I am pissed.
