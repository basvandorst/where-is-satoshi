You have to install python first. After that try to install pip in an alternate way

Ouep, j'ai tout ça, facture energie, CIN, mais voilà, je prends en photo, et j'ai un scan de ces documents, mais c'est le "selfie", j'ai envoyé un selfie en qualité normale, genre webcam, je n'ai pas le dernier iphone 6C avec 18 milliards de millions de mégapixels, mais je suis bien visible, la carte d'identité aussi, elle est lisible, et ça leur convient pas, alors j'ai envoyé un selfie de mon majeur 8-).

have you 
    apt-get update
    apt-get upgrade
your raspberry pi ?
What does it says when you try to
    ping google.com
@_date: 2014-11-22 22:36:35
Try them all ;)
I like Electrum too, darkwallet, Copay but I use mainly bitcoin core.
Blockchain too
@_date: 2014-11-27 00:44:39
There is two working ATM in France.
One in Paris ( @ La Maison du Bitcoin)
One in Toulouse, where I live (@ Mineoncloud) - just have been installed 2 weeks ago.
Most bitcoiners are completely mad about mining (and only mining).
There is a very very low number of developers as there is no technical documentations in french.
@_date: 2014-11-15 01:31:39
It works, you can test it. but the blockchain is not officialy launched, so your mining yet is for testing purpose
@_date: 2014-11-27 01:02:07
I suggest you to use Electrum wallet because of the limited disk space of your Pi (B or B+). Electrum use distant servers ( [list]( and [Github]( )
**Install python-qt4 and pip**
    sudo apt-get install python-qt4 python-pip
**Install electrum**
    sudo pip install 
**And launch it**
    electrum
If you want to try with a huge microSD card, you can also install Bitcoin-qt
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install qt4-qmake libqt4-dev build-essential libboost-dev libboost-system-dev 
    libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-thread-dev 
    libssl-dev libdb++-dev libminiupnpc-dev git
    git clone -b 0.8.3 
**And compile it**
    cd bitcoin
    qmake
    make
**And launch it**
    ./bitcoin-qt
Have fun and make sure you don't run out of storage.

Where is the eth implementation on Counterparty ? I didn't find it. 
@_date: 2014-12-21 17:06:13
My bank (I cannot change it), takes me 12.90 euros for every incoming bank transfer.
And to send money, they takes me 0,10 % of the total amount with a minimum fee of 9,90 €
My bank is La Banque Postale, it is the French Public bank company 
But it's free when SEPA

I've launched AlethZero on windows, there is no bug except nat and port but it works well on apple and nux.
It integrates the proof of concept 6, they are working on the proof of concept 7. If you want to launch your ethereum blockchain now, you can.

One bitcoin transaction equals 45 kilograms of co2 emited, We really need a proof of stake

I've organised 3 meetups last 2 months and only 17 persons came in toulouse.
La Maison du Bitcoin is a great place to come ( but only known by people interested or involved in Bitcoin. They have the same rate in meetup compared to the city's total population.
I've been in London (for an ethereum meetup), there was almost 70 persons. London bitcoin meetup raise 2000+ bitcoiners for 8 millions people (1500km2).
Compared to Paris bitcoin meetup (502) - 10 million people for paris and near suburbs (2845km2)
Toulouse Bitcoin meetup (17, some coming from 200 km away), I can say that there is a looooot of job to be done in France as we are a country waiting for governmental regulations before being involved in any idea... :'(
