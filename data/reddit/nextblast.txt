We thank Gavin very much for the time and effort he spent answering all the questions. To my knowledge it is by far the biggest AMA (50+ pages) in Chinese BTC community. 
When Gavin was in Beijing last month, I had an opportunity to have a meal with him and some friends. I proposed if he could do an AMA in China, because he is very renowned even here in the eastern world, and there are so many people would like to talk to him and ask questions. Gavin was very humble and gladly accepted the invitation. 
After a few words with my friends at 8BTC, the AMA is ready to be hosted here. Soon after the announcement, we noticed the reaction of the community and anticipated it was going to be a LOT of questions. So we formed a group of 5 translators (instead of normally 2~3) to ensure the speed and accuracy. Special thanks for two volunteers here: and It was an exciting experience initiating and working for this event. We now have very positive feedback from the community (forum and wechat):






Thank you guys for supporting this AMA, and 8btc for hosting and organizing it. Hopefully we'll have more sparks of wisdom coming from both end of the world. Cheers

Seconded. 2M cap increase with Segwit is the first step to go.

**Nine-Two Consensus for BTC**
*A note by the translator:*
*[Historically Nine Two Consensus]( is a political term referring to the outcome of a meeting in 1992 between the semi-official representatives of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in mainland China and the Republic of China (ROC) in Taiwan.*
*The title has a two-fold meaning: like the historical Nine-Two Consensus, this announcement shares the same view to seek common ground while reserving differences; Nine Two Consensus is short for Ninety Percent support and Two Megatbytes cap increase. --End of translator's note.*
* We support 2MB upgrade with the precondition of 90% hash power agree. 
Our vision comes from Satoshi's original white paper -- Bitcoin: a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System. 
The white paper has defined bitcoin as a currency, not a settlement system. 1MB will not meet the requirement for a currency, neither can it satisfy the needs in a settlement network (1MB=7 tx/second, SWIFT=60 tx/second)
This "Nine-Two Consensus" is our effort to avoid the split of the community, and ensure the safe and sustained development of this community.
Meeting held Jan 23, Beijing, with people from many Chinese BTC companies including AntPool/Bitmain, Bither, HaoBTC, BTC123, BTCKan, Richfund, Yunbi, SoSoBTC .... 
As Miami conference has not yet reached consensus, the Chinese community members gathered in Beijing to seek consensus within China. The aim is to prevent the split of community, seek common ground while reserving differences. Core has said that a scaling without consensus is too risky. We will give them the consensus. If the consensus is reached, btc market will be more stable, and in the meantime, future efforts will be more practical.
**Here in this meeting we, the attendees, all agree the following plan**
* When blocks are full, and at that time, 
* if Core has not yet upgraded to 2MB, 
* and if Classic is not enough widely supported, 
* We will do what Satoshi has pointed out  
We will add a code patch to increase the cap from 1MB to 2MB to solve the pressing problem.
This means, as we think, has a big potential to reach consensus, and urge Core to accommodate.
**[Risks in Segwit]**
Core’s Segwit plan will indirectly expand block size, but not without risk.
Firstly, Segwit has only 1.6MB theoretical effect. There’s considerable complexity in code development, which would make other applications difficult to upgrade, or even unwilling to upgrade. If only 50% tx adopts Segwit, the 6-12 months hard work will only achieve 1.3MB effect, which is more or less meaningless.
Secondly, Segwit has large modification in bitcoin low-level logic. While the workload is huge, the community is exerting great pressure. The core team has to work overtime to deliver it in time. 
Bitmain CEO Mr. WU Jihan also confirmed that "There are Core devs working more than ten hours a day and try to get the work done faster."
Many of us here has tech background. We know what overtime often means to quality.
The history of bitcoin is not absent of bugs. As indicated here  .For instance a hacker exploited bitcoin vulnerability to produce 184.4 billion bitcoins in 2010-08-15 
Currently our bitcoin is stable and solid. This is a joint hard work of six years. If we push to produce segwit, the risk is too large. We may suffer grievous loss. Bitcoin price may even go down with one order of magnitude. Which is enough to kill the future. 
So we think it’s vital to prevent core from hastily delivering Segwit.
**[Support Now]**
We will do our best to ask all bitcoin companies / users to join us. 
Please reply in this thread to help.
- Why is 90% a consensused hash ratio?
- Because some hash power is not in mining pools (solo mining or in private pools), which means they cannot express their voice. We subtract this silent portion, and get an actual 95% of total public hash, which means a consensus.

I confirm that!
Maybe some ether guys got freaked out, cause rootstock is gonna replace it :P
Just kidding, ethereum is a good idea, and crypto could use some of those different voices to keep moving forward.

No insult meant at all. Don't get me wrong! HaoBTC's boss Wu Gang is an early adopter, and an important preacher of BTC in China. He and his team are widely respected for that. So what they said has a pretty big impact.
@_date: 2016-01-21 01:52:39
OP you have my full support. I don't see how that 1MB difference will destroy BTC. 
* What I see is only ego tearing bitcoin apart hurting everyone involved.
@_date: 2016-01-21 01:38:31
I'm a native Chinese. After browsing the latest btc news and posts in our country, up to now no (big) company or organization in China has said to go against Classic and choose core only. Several Chinese companies like OKCoin, Ant/Bitmain, BW were the first ones to support the Classic 2MB plan. Others like BTCC and F2Pool will choose either side, core or classic, to upgrade to 2MB. And there's also ones like Huobi who are just staying at the comfort zone, not saying anything.
@_date: 2016-01-19 06:13:13
If its "brothers" in the title, where is Jonathan who actually is the toomin on the classic dev team list?

Bitcoin -- always has an extra life to die.
@_date: 2016-01-21 14:40:13
It's too early to jump to conclusion. Many Chinese miners and company leaders were not at the meeting. For example, I don't see guys from BW, F2Pool, BTCC and Huobi.

Too many scam sites, but I'll post one that's legit and not a scam:

With the two most prestigious companys within the ecosystem, bitpay and coinbase, heading other ways, I feel the admins should think twice. Our beloved bitcoin is hurting.

To list some of the  arguments of the [OP cited article]( written by the COO of HaoBTC:
* From the beginning classic was propagandized to be a soft fork... Now it turns out to be a hard fork. 
* We don't need bigger blocks. Problems will get solved once off-chain technologies like LN comes into being. Bitcoin should be a settlement network instead of a cheap and bloated transaction system.
* Bitcoin is extensively used in Tor network, which has very limited bandwidth. If block size gets too big, it'll be much more difficult to operate bitcoin nodes in Tor. Expense will be increased, and will result in more challenging tech problems.
* Now the cost of maintaining a node is $300. If 2M is activated, the cost will be elevated to $600, leading to less network maintainers.
Another [ long article ]( of HaoBTC employee (Da Xiong) posted today, mainly concludes that 
* The purpose (of bitcoin classic) is purely to fork, instead of to scale / increase block capacity. So, I can't see anything good in that. 
Edit: added more content and the original Chinese text.

cnLedger here. The policy was drafted last year and will officially become effective starting tomorrow.
To help you guys understand it, here I link a wsj article which explained some contents of the policy:
This Central Bank's policy itself is not meant to promote bitcoin (of course). But it will push lots of people to start looking for better ways -- convenient, censor-less, and efficient ways to transfer money. 
Bank transfer is known to be slow, expensive and cumbersome. That's why Alipay and Wechat Payment (Tenpay), the two convenient and (almost) fee-less tools are extremely popular. But now they're strictly limited by the policy. 
It is clear that with this policy in effect, banks want to force people go back and use their already heavily criticized systems. But history never goes backwards. Without Alipay/Wechat-pay, Bitcoin is one of the only few promising choices left to the public. That's why I tweeted it.

For those who don't know about the debate yet:
@_date: 2016-02-24 11:26:55
Yeah, said by iLoveChenduPanda, a Chinese Bitcoiner who lives in the U.S. He was not at the meeting though.
@_date: 2016-02-25 05:14:53
This morning on weibo: F2Pool providing option for classic miners. He also reposted (Bitmain R&amp;D Director Kevin's weibo): Classic lacking dev ability.
Another one by him on [weibo]( With our effort, Adam's title has changed back to CEO. We now support consensus statement, and meanwhile we will stay alert on this and keep pressure on core make sure the statement get carried out.
@_date: 2016-02-24 14:25:35
It is being discussed in wechat channel. Adam has explained himself that he changed to individual because he hasn't asked other members of blockstream yet, it can be changed back. Adam also said that he is a man of his words, and will honor the agreement. 
*Now its been changed back. 
@_date: 2016-02-29 00:39:59
It is also being concerned by Chinese community:
@_date: 2016-02-24 14:22:27
Now its changed back.
@_date: 2016-02-23 16:01:31
The original author is a die-hard supporter of 2.0m hard fork. Although personally I think this article is quite based on not trusting core, it has a very large read count in Chinese community (much more than other reports on the topic), and attracted most discussions. So I just translate it and let you guys read and judge.
*Also check [my twitter]( for more stories about bitcoin in China.

That is the official paper by Chinese Communist Party. It has the largest coverage in China.

Although we want that badly, the title of this post is misleading. Caixin did not say that (resume withdraws in June). They said that official regulations on bitcoin trading platforms and AML may be released in June.

I recommend BitBank(previously known as JUA)  . its the parent company of BW.com mining pool (
@_date: 2015-03-13 03:56:28
I've been a long time user of JUA, and find their service both efficient and excellent. If you have no concrete evidence that they are scheme or ponzi, it is unfair to say anything like that. Recently  they acquired highly brandable domain BitBank.com, showing genuine commitment and ambition to extend their service outside China. Previously I have posted several posts relating to the website in bitcointalk.org. There you can find detailed info about JUA.

We sent the request last month. We are very glad that Andreas ( ) soon accepted it. And with the joint effort of Mr. Antonopoulos and the CN community members, translators, organizers, we made it happen. We really appreciate it Andreas. 
*Fun fact: I think he even had to skip his breakfast for the AMA. Answered them all with a starving stomach on a saturday morning :D
