Too be fair, I DCA'ed all the way down from 7,000. Once 6,000 broke I made a decision not to catch the falling knife.  Once, blood was in the street and despair was at it's highest,  I started buying more in the 3,000's.  I used the Mayer Multiple as a guide

I would assume Naomi Brockwell had a lot to do introducing Stossel to Bitcoin.  She was his producer for his tv show

I take Bitcoin as an option.  Mainly, it is my way to evangelize Bitcoin to the general public
@_date: 2019-05-25 17:29:25
Thanks, I use a digital medium format camera

A redditor came by my booth so, cool to meet some bitcoiners in person
@_date: 2019-05-25 23:21:34
No, I intentionally don't publish my artwork.  I like to show them in person, they are meant to be seen irl.  I want to give my clients the same sense of discovery that I get exploring these buildings 
I took some other pictures in the booth here is a link
Sorry, they auto rotated upside down
@_date: 2019-05-25 22:43:16
I ship,  where do you need them to go?
@_date: 2019-05-25 17:20:33
Here's a link to some of the other art I have hanging in my booth - this is from my camera phone so the pic aren't as great as seeing them IRL 
@_date: 2019-05-25 22:41:49
Yeah, It flipped them upside down, I hate auto rotate
@_date: 2019-05-25 17:37:43
That's crazy, thanks for digging my artwork
@_date: 2019-05-25 17:02:54
