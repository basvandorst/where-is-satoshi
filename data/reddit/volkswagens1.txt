It’s the default on Coinomi. I’d rather pay less, but don’t want to wait months for my money to be moved. Yesterday I moved a lot of bitcoin cash for less than .01 USD and it took less than 10 secs for the transaction. Today, moving bitcoin and it’s been 5mins and 0 confirmations.

Coinbase has served me well. If you follow coinbase terms of service and understand their wait times, it’s a user friendly platform that works pretty decent. There is also coinbase pro. Only problem I’ve seen is, when bitcoin hits major gains and losses, due to volume, coinbase usually has issues keeping up with demand. 
I just joined Bittrex and after further review and dabbling around their site, I don’t think I’ll be usuing their service due to fees and it doesn’t feel user friendly.

They change quickly on coinbase and can vary it seems. Using coinbase Pro makes sure you don’t get slighted.

Everyone wants in on the honey pot
@_date: 2019-07-20 01:10:16
I concur. I’ve never paid taxes on crypto. I’ve also never sold anything. My hope is I don’t have to pay taxes on it. They change the law before I have to.
@_date: 2019-07-12 01:29:33
I would love this as I have a buy Id like to do soon. Been waiting for a dip to 10k or lower to buy. It seems like the push above to hold above 13k isn’t gonna happen yet.
@_date: 2019-07-20 00:53:31
Get a cold storage wallet. Move the crypto to it. Do not keep it on coinbase.
@_date: 2019-07-15 13:51:54
I use coinbase pro and pay next to nothing. I have to wait 4 days to trade my money, but i can deposit 25k per day. If I deposit before hand, continue to do so daily, I’ll be ahead and can make large purchases anytime.
@_date: 2019-07-15 13:44:22
I can’t believe that markups they charge.
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:24:30
Yeah. I was doing my part at one time and using it to purchase things. Once I realized the value and how much I was spending, I decided to just hodl. I now use fiat for spending and dump any extra paycheck funds into crypto.
@_date: 2019-07-12 04:34:05
I used coinomi for a long time. Then moved it all to a ledger
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:43:56
@_date: 2019-07-16 19:07:06
Ledger x is the new one. You don’t have to install apps and delete them when sending and receiving crypto. It makes the process much easier. The user interface for ledger has also become much easier to view/use over time. I’ll have to look again, but I believe the x is at the price point that the s was at before.
@_date: 2019-07-06 00:50:38
They usually have bitcoin listed at a higher trading rate also. So it ends up being $100’s of dollars more than you should be getting it for.
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:15:04
In a month, I won’t care where I bought in at. I’ll just buy the new dip and continue hodling
@_date: 2019-07-15 22:47:06
@_date: 2019-07-08 22:01:30
Every time I mention to someone I’m putting more money into crypto, I get nothing but flack. The amount of gains I’ve made on crypto has far surpassed any other thing I have put money into. I’m in it for the long haul, but it’s still amazing to see the gains.
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:22:15
I’d go for the ledger nano x. I have the ledger s and hate having to remove apps and add them back on all the time. I’m looking forward to upgrading soon.
@_date: 2019-07-16 18:18:04
Well, been in since around 2014. I’ve bought goods with bitcoin shortly after that, but have never sold anything. I don’t regret buying stuff when I did, just wish I accumulated more when I was using it. I have no plan to sell anytime in the future, unless I’m able to retire off of what I’ve put in.
@_date: 2019-07-10 12:20:19

Would one not have risked it, or wasted it, on some other hope or junk? 
Why would we not invest in a life altering change that could drastically change the everyday lives of everyone within the world. I’m always shocked to read the articles of how this is saving people in other countries who have severe currency volatility that exceeds that of bitcoin.

I wouldn’t use coinbase if they denied your bank. You don’t want your funds to get locked. Open a separate bank account and try again with coinbase.
@_date: 2019-07-30 23:01:24

If we all invest drastically and remain in, it removes the volatility, correct? So really, it’s like a sales tactic to convince others to do the same?

Yes. Why have a currency that loses value when I can have crypto that’s gaining momentum right now and will be far more stable later 
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:23:36
I’ve convinced many people to get on board with crypto. They have all made good amounts of return. I’ve also been able to set up and assist in starting out, moving money and making wallets. There is still people who don’t accept it. “I’ll die with my 401k”. Cool, and that you will.

In the beginning of this, when the white paper was presented, people devoted their time, energy and life into creating this. What’s the difference between that and investing the money you earned by doing the same from your 9-5, or better yet, your 9-9 job, busting your ass for nothing?

Many times I’ve gone to buy on coinbase and seen the difference and backed out. I just transfer money the long way and wait for a dip. Long as you keep money on coinbase pro for the dips, don’t have to wait for transfer times
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:07:00
But without risk there is no reward? Same with those that wasted the electricity and time to originally invest. 
If everyone continues to have faith and push the technology, It will become a new utilized and confirmed asset. It is what we make it. The thought has already been created, it’s up to us to continue to utilize and expand it. Continue to push your fiat into the product, while focusing  on its goal, it and it will become the norm.

@_date: 2017-12-28 11:58:36

I’d be in belief they don’t want major fluctuations so that either side doesn’t lose significantly. If they play with funds in the game and manipulate the ups and downs, they can slowly rally it their way for the win. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:34:28
So I order to pass, do we have to fill it?
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:21:43
I don’t foresee it being easy, but with constant talk and information being presented, people will see the result and be educated on what the goal is. 
Many will cash out along the way and regret later, as we continue to see what happens daily. Everyone keeps mentioning HODL, which keeps the price going as well. Meanwhile, others sell quickly at the blink of an eye. 
We all have our “Moon” to which we would claim we are “done” and what we would be able to live on comfortably. But are you truly, done? 
So 11,000 is the point to where you could retire and give up the new system? 
How do you convince others, that this currently corrupted system we use for fiat, is inadequate and does not benefit the mass? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:18:17

@_date: 2019-10-26 05:43:57
Ah, bloody hell!
@_date: 2019-08-12 15:25:07
The Coinomi app can sweep wallets and then you can transfer from there to coinbase to sell.
@_date: 2019-06-27 04:25:48
So, I buy bitcoin that has a premium, on an exchange. I then transfer that to a wallet and pay a transfer fee. Then when I can’t pay my rent with it, I transfer it back, pay another transaction fee. Then cash it out back to fiat, for a loss and pay taxes on that.
@_date: 2019-06-21 11:58:31
I’ve also heard good things about those. I’m familiar with Ledger S and have like it so far. I’d prefer the new Ledger X, but will get that later on. The technology is advancing pretty quickly for the cold storage wallets.

@_date: 2019-12-17 18:00:09
I use to use coin base and switched over once I realized the fees were less. I'm happy with it
@_date: 2019-12-01 04:12:33

@_date: 2019-12-17 17:21:09
@_date: 2019-12-24 16:35:47
Did you make these?
@_date: 2019-12-05 02:07:26
I have a portfolio of bitcoin I hold in a cold storage wallet. I also have bitcoin on a platform that I day trade. 
I decided 5 months ago to see if I could use some extra funds to day trade on the swings to make more bitcoin. 
So far, I’m ahead. I don’t sell for a loss. I only set my sell price above my cost average. Depending on how the market moves, depends on how often I buy and sell. Sometimes it’s quick, others it’s slow. I’m not in a hurry and just wait on the market to do it’s thing.
@_date: 2019-12-04 14:21:41
No one knows what the price point is nor the fees you are going to have. You have to figure that out on your own
@_date: 2019-12-05 03:24:15
Well said. Pretty much exactly what I am doing. I’m not in a hurry, and have been accumulating at a slow pace, but I already have more coin than what I started with.
@_date: 2019-12-07 15:56:57
They charge a premium because they can. It’s a business and they make money off it
@_date: 2019-12-05 01:32:28
I’m up almost 1k since doing this. It’s worked so far. I just put the money right back into the dips.
@_date: 2019-12-12 21:42:44
I’d rather have $3700 and watch the place burn
@_date: 2019-12-05 01:35:02

Robinhood you won’t own the keys. It’s easy to trade on robinhood and there are no fees. You’re basically trading fiat on robinhood. If you cash out on robinhood after trading, you could use the money to then buy bitcoin elsewhere.

I’m always purchasing crypto with spare money, but I always feel like it’s never enough when we have a bull run.

Get an eBay charger

How much money just flooded into the market? That must have been a huge buy order

I’m always lowering my average cost by day trading
@_date: 2019-12-05 01:33:48
Thanks. Good to see some support.
@_date: 2019-12-21 01:36:28
Got any bitcoin atms near you? Just withdraw the cash from your bank and stop using a bank. Banks suck.
@_date: 2019-12-07 16:46:51
Most all of the places you’ll purchase or trade coins will have varying rates
@_date: 2019-12-04 13:36:01
Was able to lower my average cost even more with that pump!
@_date: 2019-12-04 13:40:33
Hot damn! It ate up one of my sell orders.
@_date: 2019-12-02 17:55:39
@_date: 2019-12-16 23:25:34
I always do
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:04:24
Because it was hype. The HODLers are still in it
@_date: 2018-02-01 06:07:48
I’ll pass. I’d rather use a crypto that can move my money for nearly nothing and faster than they are attempting to. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 05:22:42
No loss if I didn’t cash out! Boom! Who’s winning now?!
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:18:51
Weak hands 
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:44:59
Did you buy it with bitcoin, or fiat?
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:04:12
That’s nothing in the world of millionaires, who run cards with $2,500 a year annual fees 
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:44:47
I’m diversified, not retarded!
Kidding, I’m retarded 
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:29:39
What did it cost?
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:42:59
How much did you invest to start your business? How much was the first machine? 
@_date: 2019-09-29 03:46:36
Your investment only decreases by the percentage that bitcoin itself decreases.

Don’t  tease me with garlicky, moist, soft and luscious transfers. 
@_date: 2019-09-30 03:57:31
They’ll audit the machine in a few days and if it shows in your favor, they’ll credit your account.
@_date: 2019-09-14 14:06:20
Chalk it up as a learning experience and move on
@_date: 2019-09-20 00:19:03
What did your descriptions say?
@_date: 2019-09-19 03:28:47
Buy more!
@_date: 2019-09-24 03:23:30
Just going to allow me to keep buying it cheaper.
@_date: 2019-09-21 15:43:24
How often do they malfunction during a transaction and how difficult is it to fix that?
@_date: 2019-09-10 22:16:13
If you use coinbase, probably safest way to do it. Pay the $10 to guarantee no issues.

We asked a guy at work to mow the lawn one time. He walked out and after 2 hours we went outside expecting it to be done and see where he was. He had not even started yet. Couldn’t figure out how to start the lawnmower. It’s astonishing how people get through life. He also had never cooked before. He told us he didn’t know how to cook an egg.
@_date: 2019-09-03 03:39:33
He likes to swim in pussy
@_date: 2019-09-22 04:48:23
That’s an expensive newspaper
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:30:15
I won’t make the same mistake I did last time and only buy a little when it drops to 3k. Gonna have to bargain shop this time and go in deep!
@_date: 2019-09-12 22:52:10
I’d recommend a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-09-20 00:47:19
Did they keep any of your money? Or they cash you out?
@_date: 2019-09-20 11:02:00
They want in on the hype. They see a threat and want to join the party, before it cripples them.
@_date: 2019-09-21 15:43:55
The ultimate HODLer
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:43:52
I just spent all my extra cash on gold and silver, not knowing this was gonna be a good buy right after.
@_date: 2019-09-26 15:47:10
Wonder if anyone’s sent them money
@_date: 2019-09-10 22:09:43
I would never transfer money to or from a place, like coinbase, without it first being in my own personal wallet.
@_date: 2018-12-24 21:14:34
I’d buy scotch every week if that was near me
