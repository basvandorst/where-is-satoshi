You guys need to pick a name for that. Satoshi is already widely used for the bitcents thing.

Are you sure about that 20%? Pls add some source

Hey guys I've just started mining on my old 386 to help bitcoin network. I know it's not much but anyway... maybe I win the lottery

LN has nothing to do with atomic cross swap.
@_date: 2017-04-16 19:46:13
Atomic cross swaps are not working at the moment. They do between other chains but Bitcoin doesn't support it actually. They need at least malleability fixed.

Why do everybody keep repeating this 'mining scale' bullshit? 100x miners will consume 100x electricity and make 100x revenue. It's LINEAR. There is no 'sweet spot' on how big a farm has to be in order to be profitable. The only difference is in buying machines/electricity with bulk discounts.
If you lose money with 1 miner you will lose 100x money with 100 miners.

Just do this and stop bitching around.

I was just encouraging self-thinking. The answer is: They don't 'get' the coins from anywhere, they just triangulate buyers and sellers.

Block validation time is block size/cpu power

Do you realize you can also SELL your bitcoins at coinbase. In that case.. where do they get the dollars from? Wholesale market?

Why not hodling yourself instead of trusting a 3rd party?

Yes. By 'their' being ETF managers. Will they split the ETF in two and give an equal proportion on both? It's up to them, I bet they won't. Just look at what happened at the exchanges with the ETC split: some played nice and gave you both chains value, some decided to ignore ETC altogether.
@_date: 2017-05-30 14:07:40
This a sub of bitcoin users, not investors. Those are at r/BitcoinMarkets
@_date: 2017-07-13 14:42:35
If the chain splits you will lose all your bits in the non-ETF chain

What can I buy with Bitcoin?

The point of loss/profit for asicboost miners is around $150 per coin. They are making a huge profit anyway.

Well of course it is not accurate  because of the shady nature of transactions. It is based on

Here you are implying that creation rate can suddenly rise which is not true. There is no risk of people spending lots of 'real' money to create more bitcoins, like you describe. Creation rate is independent.

No. Impossible.
