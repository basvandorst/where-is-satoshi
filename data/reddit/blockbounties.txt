Claim the 280 btc bounty, and include your own 200 btc bounty for the next miner from your own address (that already has 100 confirmations). If the block is orphaned you lose the 280, but you also get back the 200.

There is a $480,000 reward for increasing the block size. Seems like a good incentive!

Did you even look at the site?

The site explains how to to add money to the bounty without it leaving your own address. You can move the funds at any time, at which point your bounty will become invalidated. Most likely all large donations will take this trustless route.
A communal bounty address is set up for the small $5 and $10 donations from people who don't want to mess with the above. It's not a scam, but if it were, it wouldn't be a very profitable one.

When you started using the calculator, 3 was advertised as the answer to 1 + 1. And now the calculator salesman is telling you that if they made it show 3, it would become a centralized calculator and the Chinese government would subvert all the answers.

Agreed. The entire system relies on game theory. If this carrot can't be dangled without breaking everything, it is a failure.
