LN related Question. So say I want to accept BTC LN payments in my store but want to convert it to fiat instantly. I will technically have to close the channel and settle the tab in order to convert to fiat right? If this is true any merchant who has no intentions on holding btc is going to implement LN payments due to the volatility . it will be to costly to open and close a channel after every payment. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:43:31
Adoption should be pretty simple and straight forward thanks to several companies working on LN wallets and webui's. Based on the tutorials already existing it takes about ~15 minutes to become part of the LN network. It would only take ~1000 companies or so joining to give LN wallet users access to ever day needs. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:55:00
They normally can't. The most common way is when they make too many cash deposits in their bank and the bank flags their account causing an investigation. Most people try and obey the law though so while regulations may be just writings on paper to you the majority of people will obey it. Plus decentralized methods of doing something are never as efficient as centralized. It's too much of a hastle for a lot of people to do person 2 cash trades or jump through the hoops of a decentralized exchanges.
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:38:25
Right. So for example coinbase can hold your BTC in the cold storage vault for a small fee similar to what banks charge to hold your money. Then when you need say $2000 for the months expenses you request them to load your hot LN wallet with $2000 and there you go. You don't pay any fee setting a channel up. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:42:24
You obviously havent read any of the many documents out there that explain how it's not centralized. You're confusing trustless with decentralization.
@_date: 2018-01-18 04:13:46

For all the people saying it is costly to open/close a Lightning channel, wouldn't you be able to open one with a minimal fee at the sacrifice of just waiting 1-2 days for it to get confirmed? Some people like myself wouldn't care to wait longer.

This is actually good news. Might see new companies get some skin in the game in Norway, iceland, etc. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:45:07
Depends. Once it's opened it's opened until you close close it. Much like your hot wallet on coinbase If you use them. So you open it and then connect it to a coinbase like service where you may have 100k in cold storage. Ask them to send your open LN node another 2k and deduct it from your cold storage "savings" now they move 2k of your cold storage to their cold storage. You just topped it off without closing or opening. This is where the debate of "centralization" comes in. But it's completely optional. Like I said you can top it up on your own and never depend on LN services like this but you may have to pay a higher fee OR if you are responsible start the transaction a few days early and pay the minimum fee. Also again we have 3 more BIPs in progress that will reduce fees as well.

It wouldn't be labeled as BTC  cents if it changed to Satoshi... it would still show 1 BTC @ the current price but would instead default to listing as Satoshi. If anything people will scratch their heads and be like, "WTF is a satoshi? and why are they so cheap? I thought this exchange traded BTC not Satoshis." 
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:41:37
It doesn't get "released" in the traditional sense. It is an open source project that is already developed enough to function in the real world. It is just a matter of optimizing it and then people adopting it. The chances of it being successful IMO are pretty high. Bitcoin has given people the ability to be their own bank. LN will be the same thing as giving bitcoin a VISA payment system. The only thing a merchant would have to do once the code is solid is run a LN node and connect to the LN network and pronto you can now transact with them for pennies. I expect the LN network to grow like a wild fire Q3-Q4 of this year. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:41:26
Most likely yes. So there will be major LN hubs that offer services similar to banks. For example coinbase offers a cold storage right now. As well as a USD wallet and accepts direct deposits. They could charge a small monthly fee like a bank to have an account with them and then when your paid $1000 it goes to your USD wallet. When your $200 is up you request CB to send that $1000 to your already existing LN wallet. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:54:51
Rootstock is attempting to allow this. But as is, no your can't, the block chain bitcoin uses doesn't allow for much more to happen other than transferring digits from point A to point B. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:55:17
Yup and what is even sadder is a lot of the people over paying don't know they are because they don't technically understand Bitcoin and depend on coinbase or other 3rd partys to handle fee estimations, but their fee estimations are shit and causing their clients to unknowingly over pay. If I invested in CB I would be pissed.

Lol. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:33:47
Why would you pay $20 on-chain TX fee every month? Unless you need the funds expedited you know you can pay a cheaper fee right now like $2 and just wait a day or two for it to clear. Also people get their paychecks directly deposited into their bank accounts you know that right? When you purchase BTC or get paid in BTC it can be sent to a LN Address in similar fashion so you'd only need to pay the fee to transfer out of the bank.

Coinbase is a fucking joke. Incompetent, lazy ass fucks.

To prevent them from God forbid have to actually change the way they operate to optimize their products? The developers who slave day and night and in large GET PAID NOTHING have created the tools necessary to alleviate the very problems CB bitches about and they sit on their hands and whine. Fuck them. And fuck the incompetent Brian Armstrong.

I agree, but you would also need to include major time line events since the 2013 crash was mostly driven by the silk road and Mt. Gox crash. Events that arguably make 2013 negligible.

Within the LN the fees will be pennies. If the LN isn't successful in ~1 years time and there is no other scaling alternatives I don't think you need to worry about the price hitting 40k+

@_date: 2018-01-20 02:02:48
When there is a back log yes. But the thing to keep in mind going forward is a LN channel acts like a checking account. Once it's opened it's opened. So you may pay a higher fee the very first time to get $1000 or so in LN funds but if you ever start running out of funds or need to settle you can always start another channel a few days in advance at the absolute minimum fee since time isn't really an issue for subsequent channels.

I can imagine more regulations that make taxes less "burdensome". I wouldn't be shocked to see financial regulators create a new asset class for crypto assets that have a fixed tax % independent of short or long term gains etc. I also wouldn't be surprised for some form of mandate that requires exchanges to auto calculate gains/losses per trade for their clients so they know exactly what to report each year. Not given crypto investors the choice to LIFO or FIFO or FILO etc. Just my opinion. Also there are a lot of exchanges around the world that don't follow their proper laws such as this entire South Korea debacle. Expect to see exchanges shut down left and right over the next few years as they operate illegally until the governments catch up to them. But this already happens in general. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:56:17
The problem with this is the customer will have to pay a transaction fee to send the BTC to the store which is too expensive on-chain. If BTC is going to be a currency and not just store of value the use as a currency will need to be through layer 2 solutions like LN right? 
@_date: 2018-01-26 03:11:01
Yup. We literally do have both. BCH and BTC. I don't get why there is still some form of civil war going on. I don't understand what ricoaspero is attempted to accomplish here.. some form of religion proselytization trying to convert BTC followers to BCH or something I dunno.

This probably won't be a popular opinion, but it doesn't really matter if the spam is what is causing the congestion or not. The fact remains that people CAN spam it and ARE spamming it. Until it is no longer beneficial to spam it the problem remains. Blocks are full. doesn't matter what they are full of. Brain can change his statement to, "Bitcoin allows spam to fill its blocks making it slow and expensive for real use cases." And there is no difference.
Personally I think the miners are the ones spamming it. It drives the fees up for them. 
It will scale, give it another 6 months and it will be scaling.

You're just repeating what I said and maybe missed the point. My point is even if the mempool stays full after Schnorr signatures and bech32 address and segwit get full adoption you'll very rarely need to open a 2nd LN so in the grand scheme of things a $30 transaction to "open a checking account" within an hour on a trustless visa like network is hardly something to cry over. My other main point was if your running out of funds which anyone who knows how to keep track of their checking account or cash on hand would be well aware of this days in advance. Then waiting 2-3 business days for a new channel to open at a low $1-3 fee is not that big of a deal. Or if it is explain why. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:14:03
After Bitcoin was born and continued to evolve it became clear Bitcoin needed to adapt to knew demands. Because it's an open sourced decentralized project some of the developers disagreed on what the best way was to take care of growing pains. After trying to compromise for over a year it became clear that there would never be a consensus on what is the "right" way forward so the developers split like a Christian religion and have different philosophies.

The people that are selling aren't in it for the long term.

Took me 2 and 1/2 months to get my verification done. They are revamping their verification process currently and that is just causing their already back log to be further backed up but when they are done revamping their verification process it will hopefully be much quicker. I didn't have near as much as you had on there but when I started the process I pretty much lost access to my funds for those 2 months. They eventually got to my support ticket to tell me that they lost my utility bill and asked me to send another. I wouldn't stress about it too much.

Based on the tax basis reporting tool coinbase offers you do. They calculate the short term or long term tax on all your transactions that have been buy/sells. (they include transfers as well but that is because they can't determine if you transferred to someone else or yourself so you have to manually delete these.)
Similarly the tools out there to calculate your taxes for transactions on exchanges such as gdax do the same thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:32:33
Doesn't matter what the price is. It only matters that they predict the accurately if the price went down or up. Think about the miners. They mine thousands of bitcoins each month. They have to sell those thousands. Right now they would make more money doing OTC sales or slowly liquidating over the month. With the price going up they might as well hold onto them as long as they can while covering the utility costs and over head of their farms. With futures they can bet the price will drop and then go sell there hoard of thousands of btcs pushing the price down and creating panic to push the price even further down. its a win win for someone who holds a lot of btc and has to sell them to cover the costs of their business anyways. might as well short and make even more money.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:33:05
If you have to ask that question I personally think you have the wrong mindset. Have you asked yourself what you expect as a return? If you are banking on btc hitting 100k or what ever buying in now vs a crash is really insignificant and IMO not worth waiting. Yeah you might be able to stretch your initial investment a bit waiting for a crash or you might have to buy in when its higher and lose out. But either way if you are in it for the long haul which you should be then it now is as good of a time as any. Look at how many people bought in at ATHs right before big crashes. They are all pretty much in the green.

Seems like you got the right idea. Shady investors could go either way with futures we will just have to wait and find out and hope these exchanges do their due diligence to monitor any potentially illegal manipulative practices. 
Here is one potential use case that would effect the prices of bitcoin. If a mining pool mines 5k BTC each month they have to cash that out at some point as that is their income to cover the utility bills and operation costs. Naturally they would want to cash out in small chunks to avoid slippage. However now they might be tempted to open a short position with futures and dump all their mined btc at once. If they have to cash out anyways why not try and go short on futures and win some extra money.

You haven't missed anything. What makes BTC possible is blockchain. BTC is using blockchain tech to be a digital currency. It is the tech that allows it to be possible and worth so much.
ETH, GNT, BAT, FCT, Filecoin etc are all crypto assets that are unique in their own way using blockchain tech. They are in their infancy. The world is getting digitized as we speak with blockchain tech. Get in before you are too late with those. Some of those have appreciated over 1000% this year alone!

I have used your site and like it. I was curious if you could shed some light on a debate I have going with a friend. If you buy 1 BTC at 1k and it goes to 10k in 2 months and you sell .1btc worth you now owe short term capital gains on that 1k right? Now this resets the cost basis for the remaining .9 btc and if you wait 12 months to sell the reamining .9 its long term gains right? Or do you only have to wait 10 more months since the remaining .9 btc was already 2 months old and keep the same cost basis? Thanks.

You are grossly naive (no offense meant). BCH has larger blocks so it can handle more transactions/sec on chain and thus have LN like cheap fees. This comes at a cost. Full Nodes have to have the entire blockchain downloaded. The bigger the blocks the more HD space you need to maintain a full node. If BCH is ever handling visa like transactions it is a threat that the blockchain grows so immense in size very few people will run full nodes. This creates centralization and over all reduces security. 
Let me clarify LN for you. Its a network of nodes. You can get from point A to point B jumping between as many LN nodes as you need to. These are all still off chain. It is only when the nodes close their payment channel does the cumulative transactions get saved on chain. This allows for more people to run full nodes as the blockchain will stay much much smaller than the BCH blockchain.
BCH kicked the can down the road. They may have less congestion right now but the end game is what core developers are looking for a solution that is future proof.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:37:52
Unfortunately this is incorrect. Every transaction performed is either a short or long term loss/gain. Coinbase has a report tool that will calculate buys/sells through coinbase. Bitcoin.tax will allow you to import a history of all your trades on GDAX or any other exchange and it will calculate the gains/loss on each transaction you did on the exchange. This is why exchanges always have a history and allow you to export a copy of it.

You are forgetting your cost basis. What did that 1 BTC cost you. If it cost you $1000 and you sold it for $1000 you didn't gain anything and you owe 0 tax. If it goes to $500 after you can buy two no prob. (US)
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:06:34
I don't get why this post says 2 more minutes. Coinbase made it clear they aren't turning it on until they feel there is sufficient liquidity. Which may be never, they want BCH to go up and it won't do that. It is going to crash like a mofo and they will avoid that at all costs. If your customer's want to sell bch at $2000,1000,500, or hell even 20 that is on them. Coinbase can't claim that they are avoiding rash decisions and helping people avoid selling at erroneous prices. That is people demonstrating that they think BCH it utter trash. bastards

IMO with CBOE a CME futures and coinbase working closer with institutional investors and the over all wallet count still only around 15m I would say a strong case could be made we just witnessed the first sell off in the institutional investors phase. The public is barely rushing to coinbase to get signed up which has been a disaster. 2018 will bring ETFs and more derivatives which will be the enthusiasm stage I think. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:37:54
Pretty sure the price hike is whales buying up BTC to short futures. But each time this happens its only going to push BTC out of impatient hands to more patient hands making it harder to drive the price down and reducing volitility. So based on my research I give it a 80% chance the price drops 2-5k depending on how the circuit breakers on the exchanges are programmed to operate.

Yes CBOE and CME both offer derivatives for BTC in the form of futures. These are cash based and cash settled. The ETF proposal in this article would base their ETF's on CBOEs future derivates thus cash based and never needing to touch actual BTC. The CBOE also applied for a ETF with another company in order to offer an ETF based on the purchase and exchange of real bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-08-20 19:55:42
This ETF is based on futures. Being unapproved would be a win for this one.
@_date: 2018-08-20 23:14:16
I think they view any that deals with physical Bitcoin too risky to approve ATM. The reason they denied the winklevoss twins ETF application was because the US only accounts for a small % of the market making it difficult to mitigate any potential market manipulation overseas. The difference with the CBOE's submission is it targets high worth individuals with a minimum purchase of 200k so they in theory would understand the risk and accept it. Vs the winklevoss's proposal which would have allowed anyone participate, particularly low worth individuals who could lose what they can't afford to lose and then go cry to the SEC. 
The ETF in this article deals with a market that already exists and is based on cash settlements so there is a higher chance it could be approved than the other proposals in my opinion. But I still think the chance is low.

I think this is a sign of "it's happening" honestly. Once we get exchanges that are green lit by the government this FUD shit can go away.
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:18:45
I personally think so. The PBoC is just trying to look out for its "Citizens" and self. It makes sense that they are going to make sure there are no MML, ponzi, etc schemes going down in these exchanges. This is people that are getting paid by the government to feed their families doing their job whether for the "greater good" or not or how ever you want to term it. The moment that we don't have to worry about nefarious activities going on in these unofficial exchanges the sooner we can cut volatility. even if we loose some liquidity from people trying to launder money or run ponzi schemes etc its more healthy for official growth in my opinion. Compare them to the USA, took the USA to get exchanges even off the ground but outside of the IRS wanting all transactions history from coinbase there really is no big fear here that its going to get banned or shut down.
@_date: 2017-02-04 14:43:20
Or their coin dies like Ethereum classic and everyone floods back to core. And we finally see the light in segwit and have consensus. And they have consensus with a dying coin.
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:42:56
meh I think you are a bit too skeptical. Governments generally don't get involved in new shit until there is a loud enough demand or cry for it. Bitcoin still isn't HUGE by any means and probably wasn't even on their radar until like 2013. As it has grown its nearly impossible for someone that doesn't live there or speaks the language to understand whats going on. From my research there have been multiple MML and ponzi schemes that reached 50M+ over the last few years that has causes thousands to file lawsuits etc against some of these exchanges etc enough so that the PBoC is starting to give it more attention. It makes absolute sense that there would be a correlation between the price going up and fear that there is illegal activities going on. Unless you have proof that they purposefully want to dip the price I think you are being way to skeptical. 
The fact these investigations have forced changes in these major exchanges proves they were not following government regulations. So what you are saying is they should not investigate when people complain and the price goes up and just let it keep going? I don't see the logic here. If no one has any fear that anything illegal is going on then the government announcing an investigation wouldn't impact the price as much. These exchanges literally never knew wtf the PBoC thought or would say when they eventually did so it makes sense they would have to keep a careful eye and the price would react wildly. If you had your money invested in something you didn't know if the government would consider legal or not you would have a trigger finger ready.
@_date: 2017-02-22 17:49:07
Just stop with the noise already. Prove it. I'm not saying I don't believe you or think that is what is happening but at least I have the dignity to not claim something fact without proof.
A miner could be trying to drive the fees up for the blocks they mine for all you are aware of.
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:52:21
I agree that they are causing the volatility but their announcements have been accurate and the results of their statements have been overall in line with what you would expect so how else does the government go about it? I suppose they could be less public about it and just schedule the meetings etc in private and let the exchanges make the necessary exchanges without anyone knowing there was governmental pressure. I see that being a solid point. But at the same time they want to let the people who are investing in bitcoin know "hey we need to investigate these exchanges because we believe they aren't following proper regulations, so you might want to wait until we do before investing." But I see the changes being made an overall down the road in the future positive for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-09 11:24:17
I don't get how that is just dumb. I mean it all depends on the miners who mine for profit so if you don't think they have tried and simulate what their future will look like with segwit active and without then you are grossly mistaking. Clearly they think not activating it is better profit wise. Whether that is direct profit or indirect, like say, staying in control to ensure that someone else cant mess with their profits. etc etc

calling BU obviously wrong is a matter of your opinion. just like the many religions that claim they are the 1 and only true religion on earth the only thing they can truly due is try and convince the public of that. miners, consumers, investors etc will be convinced by which ever plan they feel is better for bitcoin. Acting like BU is trying to destroy something they are invested in is childish. They clearly think its better in the long run (even if they are deranged in thinking that) they think it. To them core backers could be the deranged one.

Of course not but we would be looking at comparing apples to oranges. XHTML and IPv6 is more so comparing a fuji apple to a red delicious apple. There isnt a huge need for a change if they both are good and work to the same degree. So far it looks as if bitcoin might not be able to ever offer anything more than it is offering right now. If a crypto being a currency vs settlement layer or safe haven asset is an apples to orange comparison. People aren't going to choose to hold bitcoin as a safe haven asset for the same reasons they can hold gold and then go get a different crypto they can use as a currency. They will prefer to treat the other crypto that functions as a currency as the safe haven asset. 
@_date: 2017-02-27 16:09:51
Gold isn't used as a currency anymore than bitcoin is right now. Its a safe haven asset, store of value. Perhaps I am thinking of the definition of "Currency" differently than you are. Golds entire value depends on it as a safe haven asset not so much its applications.

Searching is your friend. Every single bitcoin news source has an article detailing it.

What makes you believe that? Bitcoin was the first of its kind, its almost natural for the 2nd, 3rd generation versions to be better. While bitcoin seems to be at a gridlock performing any changes that would improve it 2nd generation cryptos have fixed some of those issues right out of the gun.

There could be a number of reasons. The one the op provided could be real but is not proven. 
They could be trying to add fuel to the fire blocksize debate. 
It could be miners trying to increase the fee so they make more money each block they mine.
It could be company trying to upload an immutable pdf to the blockchain or other documents. uploading a single pdf could take tens of thousands of transactions.

Why is 4-8MB too big or you just being noisy? So you would rather oppose a compromise and let a contentious HF happen where perhaps that original chain you want to stay on loses majority hash power and could become potentially worthless?  
@_date: 2017-03-08 02:48:47
A lot of people get all the events mixed up. First there was an agreement during one of conferences held in Hong-kong among a number of core devs and miners to create a 2MB block size increased HF. Then we had Segwit proposed and Core argued to a degree that just because some developers that work on core agreed to the 2MB HF doesn't really mean that Core as an entity agreed to it. They shifted focus to segwit which when it was first proposed seemed to have universal consensus at least it felt like we discovered the ultimate solution to me at least. Then we had Bitcoin Classic which was a 20MB HF proposal that was later lowered to 2-8MB and during that time BU was behind the scenes quietly doing their own thing which was a dyanmic block size. 
I do want to make one point to what you said. The way the block size increases isn't as easy as the miners just saying I want 8MB, and poof. I believe blocks can increase OR decrease and the amount of the increase or decrease is a small % of the avg of X amount of blocks previously mined. So similarly to how the difficulty adjusts every 2 weeks the size would either adjust ever so slightly bigger or smaller. so it would take a decent amount of time for miners to maliciously force blocks to a bigger than needed size. I doubt they even would but you have to cover all the risks. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:31:42
if there is a 4x increase in data transfer costs then there is a demand for that much capacity and that is a good thing, but keep in mind an increase in capacity doesn't mean it will instantly be full. Then we would need to worry about getting LN up and running to unload that to off-chain transactions its not an end of the world scenario its a lets all take a deep breath we just bought us a few more years of working things out. Do you even know how many nodes are needed for things to work? I don't really see a steep drop in nodes as an issue because there will be an increase shortly after, arguably a healthier increase, a lot of nodes are forgotten or not even managed anymore.
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:55:27
I agree, I think BTC and ETH can co-exist. Sadly I am starting to believe Ethereum may have a better chance at becoming a "currency" while BTC becomes a more safe heaven/gold type asset.

I would like to see a developers point of view on this. 
I personally am not understanding the risks core points out about being able to maliciously inflate blocksizes with "spam" transactions or miners doing it intentionally if there was a dynamic blocksize. I also think if the blockchain is growing to large too fast we would have adequate time to handle that... I don't see anyone doing anything that would cause bitcoin to fail its not in any ones best interest.

LN doesn't need segwit to function, its just cleaner, more secure, and better. so it would be loads better to have segwit, but it is NOT required.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:27:38
When the lightning white paper first came out, I agree there was talk that a blocksize increase was still going to be necessary, but its not as dramatic as 100mb+, I don't think it ever was. The eventual blocksize would need to be big enough to cover all "the tabs" being opened and closed and settled on the blockchain. those "tabs" in theory never really need to be opened and closed as long as there is enough bitcoin in that networks channels to satisfy the necessities. So in other words if Lightning does its job well and right, a big block increase wont ever be necessary. Even if the fee to close a tab is $100 or more, if that is writing $500m worth of transactions to the blockchain then that is cheap.
@_date: 2017-03-08 01:46:30

@_date: 2017-03-07 15:04:44
BU can use segwit and that has always been my concern, do they want to? Segwit improves the Lightning network which in theory can completely eliminate the need for layer 2 on-chain transactions (settlements would still be on-chain and in the 1MB block), if that is true then an increase in blocksize would not be necessary. Which brings me back to my main concern, is BU anti off-chain scaling. If they are they would never compromise with something that includes segwit.
@_date: 2017-03-15 13:53:40
Indeed, however I think some of them have overcome the pump and dump mentality. Ethereum I can understand having its own legit market cap... but they rest hell no, one would think they will all eventually tank back into BTC but there is a point where the momentum building will be to much to pull back from. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:43:19
IF BU is not actively against helping LN with a malleability fix then props to them because I agree 100% we need a solution that gives both sides what they want and then the market can decide. IF their malleability fix allows LN to flourish to the point that the market uses off-chain transactions then fantastic, if for some reason the LN isn't what its all cracked out to be and the on-chain dynamic block transactions seems to be the preferred route and works so be it. This is what I have personally been advocating for, a solution that allows both ideologies to have an equal chance. That to me is why BU seems to be pissed off because it feels like Core only wants scaling to happen off-chain. But then I don't understand fully the risks of bigger blocks with decentralization etc etc
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:30:20

@_date: 2017-03-07 15:33:11
will do, last I knew BU hadn't implemented segwit. Why did you say "segwit" is it their spin-off or version of segwit? Or did they take the code wrote up by core and acctually incorporate it along side its dynamic blocksize?
@_date: 2017-03-23 22:25:48
if those transactions occur off-chain why would the miners even care? they don't get those fees anyways. Right now the only way transactions would be fast enough and cheap enough with Core is Layer 2 off-chain LN. miners dgaf. In fact that is what they don't want to see happen.
edit: not sure why I am getting down voted. Does no one in this sub care to analyze the technical level or just down vote/up vote what they like/dislike? on-chain transactions = miners fees = profit for miners. OFf-chain = no transaction fees (only when its settled on-chain) = no fee profit for miners. Do you not realize that that is exactly why BU is gaining traction? They allow storj to exist while giving the miners what they want at the risk of further centralization. Not saying I support BU but FFS give it some thought.
@_date: 2017-03-09 15:58:37
I have been reading up about UASF lately and what an individual can do. Its not really information that is advertised or out there in the open to easily find however. Compared to some of the BU supporters running amuck with megaphones and using financial means to distort the reality it feels like a fight perhaps worth entering. unfortunately. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:47:33
I think many people underestimate how good it could be (and I probably overestimate its potential). A BU sidechain would allow the miners to safely pick a chain to mine while keeping BU coins and Bitcoins from splitting and exchangable. The problem some have with sidechains is that they see them as "parasites" they leech off the hash power of the blockchain. I see that is a potential method to further decentralization, if someone leaves the main chain to go to a side chain that gives someone else opportunity to fill in that gap. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:00:12
If the majority of the users support core but the miners force BU's plans why would the price of "core coins" dump and "BU coins" rebound sharply if they don't want to follow those rules? I think this is what should be avoided.

Bitcoin has a scaling problem. There are 2 different proposed solutions to fix this problem. 1) segwit and layer 2 options. 2) BU and a flexible blocksize limit. 
 
From a technical standpoint that is the most inaccurate description I have ever heard. Perhaps all this noise from people who don't understand the technicality behind both solutions can give a "hijacking" vibe, but you are being ridiculous.

You know I dgaf whats next, If we have another group break off that believes in a different future other than core or BU then we are going to have 3 groups trying to win the miners over. This is BS. Forks need to be a norm, if a group of devs have a different mind set they need to fork off and start their own coin if the miners want to go so be it. but different opinions preventing the majority opinion from moving forward is stupid AF.

Thanks for the reply, makes a lot of sense to me. So you think if 75% of the hash rate is going to go with BU people wont panic sell core coins in an attempt to stick with the "most secure" chain? You think its better to let that all ride out vs avoiding it? Why not implement something that allows everything Core thinks is appropriate (segwit), and everything BU thinks is appropriate (dynamic blocksize) and then let the users choose whats best going forward and avoid a contentious fork? To me if its "oh shit this big blocks are screwing things up lets use LN instead" then so be it, or if "oh shit LN isn't going to work, good thing we can use dyanmic blocks until something else is proposed better, if needed."

So you are saying someone sending transactions with only malicious intentions? The blockchain is a public and open source technology, its available to everyone and anyone, if they are allowed to do that they are allowed to do that. If everyone agrees there is 0 benefit to that then it should/can be addressed. Last I knew nodes can configure them self to ignore dust transactions and dumb memory filling "spam".

The point is if its successful in what its purpose is and there is no risk or malice then it will be 10000% less controversial in doing another HF. I don't like the argument "lets not just kick the can down the road" I think you should kick the can down the road and if everyone is happy shits then move towards a perm solution.

There's no difference between fiat and crypto. Banks realize loses all the time when people withdraw their fiat from long term compounded saving accounts. They have to pull fiat from their reserves just like blockfi will pull crypto from their reserves. The only way a 6% interest rate is feasible is if they are loaning out more than people are depositing in savings. Which I agree with you is not the likely outcome. They will most likely lower that interest rate in a few months.

Wouldn't say this analogy makes sense. You have the ability to do that sure lol, but that is actually illegal and there are consequences for doing that hence no one does that, sending transactions on the blockchain is not illegal there is no consequence (to yourself) for doing it. And that is kind of the point. Perhaps a better analogy would be if there was a parking lot that cost $5 per car to park and you have the money and enough cars to fill it up you could do that there is nothing stopping you, you will be vilified for it but its not illegal and within the "rules".

What do you mean fudging data and legality? It's up to the person reporting their taxes to fill out the forms. None require an exported list of sales from the exchanges used. You can manually provide that information if you choose too. If you do it incorrectly and get audited then your Sol. Exporting lists just allows software or accountants to calculate it automatically or for you.
Example, friend gifts me BTC and a year later I sale it to my friend bill for cash. It's my job to know what the cost basis was of the BTC when i received it and accurately fill out the 1040 form or what ever it is. Regardless if I sold it in person for cash or through coinbase no reports are required.

WTF, how stupid can you get. segwit2x is the exact same fucking thing. It just gives a 2MB block size to temporarily relieve congestion. LN is just as usable with 2x as it is with 1x. How blind can you get? LN even REQUIRES bigger than 1MB blocks at some point in the future! The only reason to oppose an immediate increase from 1mb to 2mb is because "the miners think they are in charge, and we need to show them whos boss."

It's simple to get really. Investing in commodities and stocks or what ever has always been done through institutions for decades. E-trade, brokers, etc. It is how nearly every one in the world invests, it is what they know, how they do. Telling them to download a digital wallet and register at an exchange and convert fiat to crypto and withdraw into a multisig paperwallet etc etc is not anything remotely close to what traditional investing is. That is what makes us so special and early investors in this space. We are Alpha investors/adopters. GBTC is the pre-mature beta medium to get involved, and the first ETF's to go live will mark the dawn of mainstream investors.

Hmm. I'm still suspicious that only one private key was stolen then. Unless the other 2 had miniscule amounts compared to the one that was stolen. How were you checking the balance and how often? I'm assuming you were only using the public key to check? After they were generated did you scan or retype the private key anywhere at any time?
Edit. Also perhaps looking at the time the funds were swiped might help. It's common for a the thief to jack them right after they steal the private key. So try to recall what was happening around that time.

A few years probably, kind of one of the main reasons people are pushing segwit2x. You know, an immediate 2MB blocksize to relieve some pressure for the next year or so for segwit to mature. But I guess we will become super centralized or something like that if we HF to segwit2x

The most important aspect about bakkt that could boost the price IMO is onboarding legacy merchants, such as Starbucks. If they deliver a true method to allow traditional merchants to start accepting BTC payments people will have a less speculative reason to invest. I first got in when I could actually spend my BTC on basic necessities. Since then merchant adoption has stagnated and people are only buying it as a store of value, gold 2.0 and not as a currency. This is bad. Once people see merchant adoption and it's viability as a better currency than Fiat the price will boom. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:06:31
I don't think anyone wants another used "chain" that is why there is was originally no replay protection so it was risky and pointless to stay on the other chain. If the other chain has no hash power then it will be too slow to be economically feasiable and should just die. As for what happens if segwit2x gets implemented and used. Honestly I dont think anything. maybe maybe maybe 5% or so of the nodes can't handle the increased capacity and drop off but it pisses me off people think it will hurt that already centralized state bitcoin is in

All of his personal information including a government ID. He can probably cash out the minimum daily which is like $200 without giving up all his identification but after about 10 times in a row they will ask for more information. There is no way he is going to get 40k cashed out without giving a government issued ID. Also Coinbase will trace the origin of his newly aquired 40k to your wallet and as far beyond as possible if there is any reason to believe your coins came from illegal activity they will close his account.

How many paper wallets were generated? And were the private keys different? This could explain why one was stolen and not the others.

Node count doesn't contribute to mining centralization/decentralization. Nodes don't add to the total hashing power.

Traditionally yes, and it will become more stable the more it is used which requires massive merchant adoption and laws that make taxing each transaction less burdensome.

Elaborate, or are you just repeating shit you read? Miners want 2MB blocks. It is really a simple request. No different from Union protestors from time to time. It is in their best interest and there is not really any hard data that shows it is harmful or unreasonable, quite the contrary 2MB blocks would help alleviate congestion while off-chain LN solutions mature and segwit hardware becomes dominate. Riddle me this, if the ultimate solution is layer 2 protocol with LN via segwit then whether the blocks are 1 MB or 2MB 10 years from now is irrelevant, but to make the ignorance even more evident even core has awknowledged that layer 2 solutions like LN will ultimately need bigger blocks on the settlement layer! They straight up say for visa level scaling we will need bigger blocks but lets not do it now and make this a huge controversy. The software is not poorly tested, stop for 1 bloody minute and think about what you just said. The code for segwit2x is already running! The only difference is changing the blocksize from 1MB to 2MB and other optimizations. That is what the agreement was, first we activate the code and then we hardfork to increase from 1 to 2mb. The code has been tested in testnets and will continue to be tested until November. I don't give two shits of you don't like segwit2x. But do some research before you start making some noise. 
So you argue they want continued control of the protocol while pledging allegiance to core having control? Hypocrite.

I don't know how it is now but a few months ago I made several purchases using it with a 20% discount and they got filled in ~8 hours. I did a 15% discount that was filled almost instantly. I would imagine as bitcoin is in high demand you might get higher discounts filled faster? Not sure but the 15% range is what they recommend. I also had a friend get a 35% filled after ~2 days. Fillers tend to pick wishlists that don't have multiple items from what I hear.

ViaBTC is like what 9%? Segwit is at like what 30%? If my math serves me right that means there is still another 61% that is not committed to segwit. I have this strange feeling they all share the same sentiment and when a solution is offered they will probably all show support for it.

If a customer shows proof they didn't receive their product and the merchant refuses to issue a return their reputation will quickly go to 0 followed by them going out of business. It is in businesses best interest to have a good reputation. If you are doing business with a new lesser established company make sure you look into their guarnatees before buying a product from them it is that simple. Companies that have not established a strong reputation generally guarantee some form of reconciliation that can be challenged in court if they don't honor it. It's that simple.

The replay attack was possible because ETH forked, had it not this would not have happened and Coinbase would not have ever been "hacked". The other exchanges were outright hacked.

@_date: 2016-11-18 14:32:16
That last sentence is pure FUD and not true, do us all a favor and stop being so noisy. Lukejr as been exploring ways of doing a "non-controversial" hard fork should it ever be needed and the other side of the debate have been very specific as to what they would like to see happen in addition to segwit. No one controls 10% that isn't looking to compromise it is comments like these that do no one any favors and only create more distance and contention. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 19:54:44
what is so lol about my comment? Are people really that naive here? Not sure why this is getting downvoted. Miners are striving to get as much hashrate as possible. between 40-50% the community starts to react negatively towards them so it would be logical for them to float in that range to maximise their profits. wtf is wrong with people. If their main goal is to go over 50% which they have a lot of incentive to do so, which literally make them more money then that is bad!
unless you think they are going to start holding hands and dividing up the hashrate equally you got another thing coming. Those who are making the most money can afford to expand their farms at a faster rate. We are getting to the point where the initial cost of trying to jump into the mining market is 100s$M. If bitcoin goes main stream you will need 1billion+ to even try to get in at a profitable hashrate. At this point unless the miners who got in from the start can keep up with each others expansions eventually we will see ~2-4 big mining farms left.
@_date: 2016-11-02 20:24:48
Interesting point. If you are making more selling the ASICs than you would be from the block reward subsidy then you have a valid point. But I still don't believe they would allow their own Hashrate to fall below a certain %. It almost allows them to exploit their clients by making them have to buy more and more to keep up with them self since they get first priority obviously.

Therefor they either weren't being as anonymous and smart as they could have been by doing what you are mentioning, or perhaps it really isn't 100% anonymous. I am not technically savy enough to prove that but seems like most of the time nothing is exactly 100% anonymous. Someone could analyze the payouts or some crazy voodoo shit like that.

What is the difference of having 1 farm at 40% of the hashing power vs 2 pools at 20%? The only difference I can see is to avoid that fear factor of owning more than 50% but any proof that they have over 50% I believe will have the same affect... it should IMO.
@_date: 2016-11-02 17:35:05
Mining is expensive, they mine for profit and nothing more. We have already had miners in the past say things such as, "Yes we have over 50% but just trust us" or give some public declaration of "trust". I want to believe it is safe to say even if they get over 50% they wouldn't be malicious as that would destroy bitcoin and ultimately their income. Only time will tell.
@_date: 2016-11-16 19:02:31
They want transactions to occur on-chain not off with LN. On Chain transactions have fees, the miners get the fees. The miners currently pay all their bills with the block reward. The block reward will eventually halve until it is essentially non-existent. Once the miners no longer get a significant enough block reward they depend on the fees from transactions to pay their bills. If the transactions are off-chain they don't get transaction fees. No transaction fees means can't pay bills. Can't pay bills means can't secure the block chain. Can't secure the blockchain means no bitcoin, at least not in the "trustless, "decentralized"" manner we see it today at least. So the debate is if the miners will still make enough money if there can only ever be 1MB worth of transactions in each block.
edit: it is important to note that they believe that bitcoin can scale on-chain. That is at the heart of the debate is if it is possible or not.

I don't think BU would have any issues compromising for supporting segwit should there ever be consensus to hardfork to BU. That is what makes this debate so interesting. Segwit and LN will work with any size of blocksize, arguably it actually will even need bigger blocks itself which is probably more compelling motive for lukejr and other to try and come up with a way to hardfork without creating a operable side chain. So if segwit and LN work with any size of block why not increase the blocksize and let the users and people choose how they want to scale? They could literally choose between Core's vision or BU's vision. Core argues that blocks should stay as small as possible. Many pro big blocks advocates compromised over a year ago basically saying, "yes we see how really big blocks could cause problems so lets just go to 2MB and see what happens from there." They determined along with miners that 2MB wouldn't pose any of the threats Core was talking about.

No, I think BU would implement it with the HF (that might be what you meant or were saying) there is no reason not to if that is how Core wanted to compromise with them. But I don't think Core would ever compromise to a dynamic blocksize anyways. Not right now anyways. 
I am not really part of "you guys" I am not a part of the other sub, it is too hostile, bias, and narrow minded. I do believe that both sides have valid arguments and points and that both methods would work, which is why I would like to see there be some form of compromise.
Core themselves have made it clear that they believe 95% should be needed and if its not achieved then things need to change so I have hopes that if it isn't supported by 95% we will see a compromise that makes everyone happy.
I think we need to get used to the idea of a non contentious hardfork. I don't see bitcoin surviving if we try to work around HF's all the time. It can get messy and completely annihilate innovative thinking. A HF doesn't have to create a mess. People point at Ethereum and Ethereum classic as an example of why we avoid it. But in all honestly Ethereum classic is dead. They really just proved that the dominate chain with super majority consensus will always win. I am excited to see what lukejr comes up with in terms of Hardforking. I think bitcoin will eventually evolve into a complex multi-braided-chain system like that which was presented in Milan.
@_date: 2016-12-27 13:47:31
I would not. I would call the "hacker" an exploiter. From a business stand point however it is generally better to say you were hacked rather than, "We didn't take the appropriate security measures to ensure a replay attack could not be successful in case one of our crypto trading pairs forked." this is all just my opinion however. To me there is a clear distinction between someone exploiting your services because you did not prepare proper security measures, VS someone taking advantage of how your service is ran. Someone took advantage of how their service operated, nothing more. You only need to understand how it operated to accomplish what these exploiters did. 
For example if a game uses the internal clock to grant 1 life every 2 hours that is how the programmers intended the game to be played. If someone realizes they can just change the time on the internal clock to 5 years in the future and get thousands of free lives did they hack the game? no they exploited a feature by understanding how it operated. Hacking would be finding the code and modifying it to grant a life every 1 second or just changing the value to what ever you want it to be. 
More evidence that they were exploited is the fact they did not chase the exploiters by law or attempt to get back what they lost.

You're correct. But what I mean is if the company is clearly abusing the majority of it's clients it won't survive. The reality for this concern of not being able to do a charge back the pros outweigh the cons IMO. Most charge backs are actually done for malicious reasons not even honorable reasons. I think once enough honorable and reputable companies are established no one's going to care that crypto transactions are 100% pull transactions with no ability to perform a charge back. Well actually there will be other layer 2 applications that allow for charge backs even I am sure.

There was a little uncertainty if you could consider crypto to crypto a "like kind" exchange prior to 2017 and defer the taxation, but the IRS clarified the verbiage starting 2018 that crypto isn't a "real property" and like kind exchanges can only be done with "real property" such as a house.

There is a 99% chance the bank will freeze the transaction for fraud alert yes. You should call the bank in advance and ask for international restrictions to be temporarily lifted. That is what i have always done. They usually ask how many I intend to make and at what prices and then give me the go ahead for 24 hours. I tried processing a $7 Temporary Canada traveling visa the other day and the payment failed because it was processed in Canada. You would think the banks would have foreign government websites white listed but that shows you just how anal banks are about foreign transactions.

Probably not. Especially if you live in the US. You just created a taxable event and now have to pay long/short term cains on the cost basis of that LTC when you converted. If BTC tops out soon and LTC pumps after you're going to owe taxes on a loss (if it exceeds 3k). If you thought you might want to convert LTC to BTC it should have been done before the price movement, the fact you thought to do it while BTC is rising is what screws most people over.

First, MtGox lost its ability to process FIAT transfers, the same thing is happening to Bitfinix. The big difference here is that then there only really existed MtGox, now there are dozens of exchanges, however a very limited amount of them actually allow moving FIAT in and out. 
Second, Tether is always $1USD it can fluctuate tenths/hundreths of cents but its essentially always worth $1. The point of Tether is too allow a tUSD pair on exchanges that don't allow FIAT deposits/withdraws. You still have to move your tether to an exchange that accepts it and allows withdraws to actually get FIAT out. 
Third, you may not see it now, or may not see it happening in the future, but mtGox is essentially the absence of FIAT deposit/withdraw capabilities, so whether other exchanges experience the same issue in the future who knows.
@_date: 2017-04-20 16:10:53
Basically. You deposit $5m USD on bitfinix and then bitfinix says "you can't withdraw any USD or Fiat for that matter" You are then forced to buy bitcoin with that money and transfer those BTC to Kraken or Coinbase to sell them. Basically shits hitting the fans. If coinbase or kraken start to have issues with Fiat withdraws we are going to enter a 2nd mt gox phase.

If you are aware about it and are disregarding it as the reason for the premiums, then to put it politely there is no hope for you. I just hope you are using the opportunity to sell at a premium. I mean the writing is on the wall my friend, the price increase is clearly and sololy do to artificial demand. The exchanges that have stopped processing USD and other FIAT withdraws (bitfinex, and others) are all trading at premiums. This is pure evidence that the demand is artificial. You deposit $5m Fiat to Bitfinex and they don't allow you to withdraw that FIAT back out what do you do? Buy there and sell somewhere else. 
Now eventually they will get new banking partners and guess what? people will need to sell, so again I hope you are selling at the premium and not buying thinking this is a sign we are going to the moon or you will regret it. 
OR coinbase and kraken and the exchanges that are ~$60 cheaper announce they can no longer wire FIAT and we have Mt. Gox 2.0.

Apparently we can't get real discussion OP, sorry. What a bunch of pathetic comments.
Some of the points aren't incorrect as far as I can see but LN makes all those points valid for BTC as well. Not only does it make them valid (instant, cheap, transactions that can scale beyond VISA levels) but it also keeps the block size small which despite this article arguing less nodes isn't an issue there is benefits to having more.
 BCH will potentially have low fees with big blocks. BTC will have low fees with LN as well. LN brings in a lot more benefits than simple on-chain transactions can have. BCH indefinitely expands the freeway. LN creates teleportation.
 is invalid once layer two options are functional for BTC. it's a temporary talking point that will not exist very long.
 BTC and BCH are both P2P 
 is debatable. Whitepapers are hardly ever the same as long term results. they evolve. There is discussion within the first year of the white papers release that details payment channels and layer 2 future options. Whitepapers don't predict the future there are more so in line with MVP releases. 
 BTC allows instant transactions. in fact true instant transactions as 0-conf transactions are leaps and bounds more secure than 0-conf on-chain transactions.
 is just stupid. People buy BCH and BTC for the same reasons whether its to be a p2p currency or as a get rich quick investment. You can't prove which % of adopters have which philosophy in mind when they invest. sorry.  
 again they are using the temporary high fees to bash BTC. in 1-2 years there won't be high fees with BTC. in the meantime they will fluctuate. 
 the argument that core is centralized is invalid by the very fact that BCH exists. It is open source, if people commit code that doesn't get consensus they can go hard fork their own chain IE BCH. if someone needs to hard fork because consensus wasn't achieved that speaks for itself.

Great article! I know I will get down voted for my next comment, but can't we at least start talking about a block size increase on a roadmap? Or are there still arguments against this articles assumption it will be necessary? (although technically it is less necessary to increase it now than it was before (segwit, Schnorr coming, etc), but socially it might still be a good idea as BCH idiots use this as their go to argument to scam millions of people) segwit2x doesn't seem so bad after all after reading this article. I can't help but feel there was a little ego/denial involved in being so anti segwit2x anymore, but perhaps at the time these details weren't understood well enough to take the risk of an increase? I feel like all the progress that has been made recently is starting to head in a blocksize increase inevitably like this article suggests. I feel like I'd rather have Core implement bigger block sizes (hell they could be dynamic based on the LN?) before BCH implement LN and then shills even harder. I can totally see this article slapping realization to the faces of BCH devs and causing them to implement LN and then promote some sort of "we have the perfect blocksize/LN endgame protocol!"
EDIT: yup here come the down votes. It is pathetically sad that just mentioning blocksize increase = insta downvotes. Unless it is the BCH brigade auto down voting threads I can't explain it?

BTC and BCH will forever have on-chain transaction fees. Which ever network is the most preferred and adopted will ultimately have the most fee reward for the miners. There is also nothing preventing miners from offer a LN service where they are getting LN fees as well.

You forgot the part where he follows that up saying but he really has no idea, that his investments are more related to real estate. This, plus he doesn't invest in tech already warrant any opinion specific to crypto blasphemy. The only thing anyone should trust from any one are universal concepts related to investing. Such as the quote I provided. Which holds true almost always if the product is successful. Although you can say he was somewhat correct. What he saw was an investment growing at a stupidly fast FOMO rate which universally means bubble and big correction. Be careful to connect those facts to crypto it has nothing to do with crypto. Everything to do with something increasing stupidly fast. Tulips, crypto, dotcom, shoes, computers, cure for cancer, doesn't matter what it is or how revolutionary it is. If it goes up that fast it's going to come down, that doesn't make it a failure. Maybe to the short sighted. Let's converse in a year or two when the bigger picture has occured.

I agree. However unfortunate it is half my friends sold their BTC for BCH after the fork. I don't believe they are building momentum as clearly the BCH:BTC Ratio since the fork is dramatically down but it doesn't change the fact the having a misleading argument to deceive new/current investors puts a real pain point on public perception. If a blocksize increase is inevitable even for the core protocol then why allow BCH to fester the space any longer than we need to? I am not talking about rushing into something but even just a verbal comment about its future implementation will go leaps and bounds against there only "real" selling point.

I've been around for a very long time and that's not how I saw it go down. There was months of debate and attempts to reach consensus and compromises. In the end the majority of people seemed to agree with what the core developers proposed as a solution. At that point you can't just say. Well because these few developers don't agree and a minority of users we are obligated to implement their BIPs 
I would be interested to hear what core developers would say if hypothetically someone comes up with a way to scale infinitely on chain with small blocks. I'm not sure it's even possible but I would be curious if they would implement it or stick with layer 2 solutions. That to me is the question that needs to be asked
@_date: 2017-09-22 21:49:37
Not a developer so please bear with any ignorance, but isn't segwit2x just suppose to be literally everything Core is/has done with the minor change of increasing the block size constant from a 1 to a 2? I wouldn't imagine that would take very long or be difficult to do so most of the work would of course still be reflected under the Core github activity.

It is exactly why they are supporting it. the 2mb increase means they get more space without having to lift a finger. They don't want to have to do anything, at least for awhile. They either want massive blocks so they don't have to worry about anything or some pressure relief with 2mb so they can take their sweet ass time adopting segwit and LN tech.

Meh, the 21m fixed supply along with the revolutionary tech powering bitcoin (block chain) is attracting a lot of smart investors that firmly believe at some point in the future adoption will happen and a rat race for those precious 21m will ensue. These early bird long time hodlers alone can keep the price propped up decently. They don't care what it is as long as its under 50k they won't bat an eye. Lots of sharp economists value its potential 100k-1m if it succeeds its purpose. 
But you are definitely right that the increase was stupidly sharp and a high % of people were FOMOing and MANIAing hardcore. 
However real use case has actually been growing. You can analyze the block chain and see. As well as read blogs from payment processors such as bitpay that mentioned converting over a billion for their merchants. Real use case value I say could keep it in the ~2000 range alone. Add in the hodlers and I think 4-6k valuation is about accurate.
My guess is we will drop down into that range for a few months and we will witness the true value for awhile and then another slow climb while LN and other developments ramp up hype all over again to the next FOMO cycle of 40k+!

There is a graph somewhere that is showing why 10 minutes was optimal based on global bandwidths etc. From what I remember is the faster the blocks are the harder it would be for miners with less bandwidth to keep pace with larger miners. They could be stuck validating blocks while larger miners are solving blocks and since you can't attempt to solve a block until you validate one they could essentially fall so far behind it would be futile to mine unless you live where the bandwidth is blazing. it was to prevent centralization.

You do realize that you can store your BTC and such with centralized companies such as coinbase's cold vault to have your funds insured? It isn't the protocol's job to offer some form of risk/fraud protection its companies jobs. 
A store/friend/company accepting BTC as a form of payment is more than welcome allow reversals and paybacks. But if you go withdraw all your money from your bank and walk around with it in a back pack and get robbed then you're screwed. keep your btc in an insured cold vault and only carry as much as you intend to spend in a hot wallet just like cash. It's digital cash. what did you expect?

It will always be "profitable" to mine. It will just lose security. Miners just start turning off rows of ASICS when the reward &lt; costs. until the reward &gt; cost.

There is a few reasons its still technically better. 
1) You don't have to give them anything but your BTC address vs personal information that will be stored and susceptible to hack. The same security and piece of mind as if you had paid with Cash. Apple pay, Android pay, etc all still surrender your personal information each time the phone is scanned.
2) It is a pull transactions. Similar to a debit transaction. You can't do it if you can't pay for it. This means the company doesn't have to worry about charge backs or fraud. 
3) if LN is implemented it will cost the business next to nothing to accept payment via BTC vs traditional services that charge 1-3%.
4) Decentralized/trustless. Don't have to rely on any company's systems to be functioning or denying the transaction etc. Visa and master card have both had down time recently where people were unable to use their cards. 
A combination of 2 &amp; 3 means they could potentially give a discount and save money. In the example of a movie most places when you buy online charge you a "convenience fee" essentially that 1-3% the business is charged for allowing them to use their payment rails (visa/etc). with BTC they wouldn't need to charge that BS markup.

Well first of all I hope it gets pushed back at least 6 months to give segwit to evolve and then it should be re-evaluated if it is even necessary. However, if it does get pushed out in November and is backed by the hashing majority and "economical majority" (it will not have user/community/node support there is no doubt) I would hope that the core devs continue with their new roadmap for privacy improvements and start building on top of it so there is no new fork being supported. I would really hate to see another alt coin born out of this ordeal, but if the core devs want to build on the old segwit chain and let others build on segwit2x I guess that is their choice. but the reality is if the block size being 1mb or 2mb is going to have a make or break impact for bitcoin it still wont be known for 5+ years or it will be known instantly IMO. I guess some core devs have said that they would stop contributing if segwit2x gets activated but I dunno.

There is nothing special about the piece of gold in this video being physical. A concept that most people can't understand. Scarcity, durability, immutability and divisible are IMO what makes something a good medium of exchange/currency, such as gold was. Bitcoin is superior in all of those categories the only aspect up for debate in my opinion is intrinsic value but a currency does not need any intrinsic value IMO. Had bitcoin been a viable option a thousand years ago paper money would have never happened.

That was my question "until such time as they choose to hard fork" will they choose to HF? I hope the answer is yes but during the last upgrades there was a very determined "HFs are bad and should be avoided at all costs mentality." I just wondering if it's the same.

Is decentralization important to you? If yes then yes they are that important. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 18:07:30
That doesn't really argue the point though. BTC hit a ceiling that created a back log which drove fees up. You wouldn't see that happen with BCH regardless of how full their blocks are now. They get to advertise a flat fee regardless of tx/s.
the problem is if they intend to scale to Visa like levels the only miners that can validate the blocks fast enough will be numbered on one hand, centralized. The amount of nodes available to synch the block chain or to download it will be very few. This makes it much easier to seize control of the network or shut it down as its not very decentralized. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 23:46:31
So you believe its better to not hard fork if there isn't consensus and then let the disgruntled minority/majority fork off their own chain and try and keep it alive? The way I see it the more the Genesis chain forks the easier it is to get consensus for a particular chain. 
Also so should upgrades always be proposed as a hard fork first and then if consensus isn't obtained to what you can via soft fork? I just remember hard forks being like an absolute no go for most core developers which doesn't make sense to me.
@_date: 2018-04-20 01:06:39
I'm not defending them persay (disclaimer: only my friend uses them) but I work with IT for big companies and while I don't doubt they could be better and probably had time to improve things. The VAST amount of complaints and issues started around the same time people were complaining about Poloniex and GDAX and bittrex closed new registration and bitfiniex closed new registrations, and so on. So yeah I am defending them a bit. The facts are there. They grew way faster than humanly possible to keep up with. They still could improve a lot of things according to my friends that use them but over all they are fairly satisfied right now with their new upgrades and response times. The problem is it's smarter and more profitable for companies to lag behind demand than build ahead in anticipation.

@_date: 2016-10-28 20:02:28
actual motivations? You say that as if they are malicious. The way I saw things is they argue it can be done without any negative side effects, an 2MB increase was them compromising to Core's accusations it is not safe or smart. There is a graph if I remember right showing that all the miners agreed 2MB would be ok? The debate is if bitcoin should/can scale on chain or off chain. I think we all know at some point the block size is going to increase... I am pretty sure Luke wouldn't waste as much time as he has trying to come up with a safe method of implementing a  hardfork. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:56:17
I could be wrong but I don't think it matters who bought it. As long as the tax is paid anyways. Send them their fraction of bitcoin and provide them the cost basis you purchased it at so when they cash out in the future they can pay the appropriate long term taxes. Should be as simple as that.

The OP is saying people are claiming that LN will lead to the transition of PoW to PoS. In PoS you have individuals that stake their money in order to validate the transactions just like miners do for a return. If they misbehave by validating invalid transactions then they lose a portion of their locked up funds. Most of the big blockchains gaining momentum have taken a PoS approach vs PoW since it doesn't require enormous amounts of electricity.
PoW required miners yes, without them PoW does not work. PoS however does not require miners at all, rather Stakers.

I am starting to worry how this debate has become all about supporting segwit or BU as the end all solution to the scaling debate.... It's pathetic really. 
I don't see how this is bad news. We need SAFE SECURE SCALING. PERIOD. END OF DEBATE. Segwit IMO is the safest and most secure way to accomplish that as of right now. If bitpay wants to come up with an even better solution than BU and Segwit that shouldn't be a bad thing. It's not bloody segwit or nothing folks.

I think you underestimate how big of a slice it is. If you compare the graphs and charts around the first hype revolving around it I think you will realize how big of a part it had in the movement from 1k to 12.5k. I don't think its as big of a factor this time around but I could be wrong, according to several articles the chances it gets approved this time are about 4x higher now and we are seeing about 4x the agression in price movement from the prior announcement. in lieu of literally no good news regarding the scaling debate and the bitfinex issues there really is nothing else to contribute the rising price. I would re consider how big of a factor the re-evaluation of the ETF exactly is having on the current price.

There is an excuse for it breaking out however, bitfinex. Has to be treated as an outlier 
@_date: 2017-05-09 19:05:37
It's not a stupid question per say, but it is one that has been asked about a thousand times the last month :p
Anyways, you technically can do that but there is almost always a technical reason there is a price different. Certain exchanges have more restrictions or different regulations and charge higher fees etc so by the time you are done doing what is called "arbitrage" you will realize that it wasn't really worth it in the end do to all those small factors. 
Now in a perfect world where all the exchanges have the same fees and offer the exact same services it would work. Except the prices would all be the same. So it wouldn't work.
The bitfinex situation was a good example of how it would be possible to do that and profit. You used to be able to withdraw USD but that got suspended so the only way for people who deposited USD to get their USD back was to buy bitcoin driving the price up and selling it elsewhere driving the price down, and thus creating a price gap. But there is no point to buy low on coinbase and sell at bitfinex because you now have USD that can't do jack shit. You could wait for their banking relations to get resolved and then maybe have profited but is that a risk you are worth taking? As the price goes up and up and eventually if they don't continue USD withdraw you are now forced to sell at a now higher price, taking a major lose.
However bitfinex does allow withdraws in its local currency. So if you had duel citizenship and a bank account in thailand you could take advantage of the the price gap and then eventually convert back to USD.
Hope you get the picture. 
TLDR: price gaps mean friction/restrictions and its very rarely a sign of legit arbitrage. it's a no go.

@_date: 2018-04-28 21:00:00
Hmm, not sure I see it that way. Trying to keep the network united would mean compromising when their is a split decision on an upgrade. Core has always let the consensus decide. If the majority are against a specific upgrade that requires a hard fork they won't support it forcing a Forked altcoin to be created so the minority get what they want elsewhere while the majority get to keep what they feel is correct. This ultimately allows the minority to leave the network for what they felt was a superior network.
If things can be done via softfork that is all the better but is it really better if they only plan around soft forks limiting themselves to what they could potentially achieve? 
I think Hard forks should be a normal and routine thing. The sooner people who disagree with Core can move off to their own coin the healthier Core would be essentially wouldn't it?

Right but if LTC is a copy + Paste of BTC and has all the same features as BTC and all the projects revolving around BTC are open source and there for can be easily copied over to LTC you do realize that people will go with the cheaper option if they can have all the same benefits as BTC right? LTC is stealing potential market capital from BTC. I am not saying BTC wont have more users and more hash rate and be more secure and therefor the first choice because that will all be true, but that doesn't change the fact people will go to LTC instead when they could go to BTC.

You kind of answered your own question. securely and efficiently. although I think what anyone means when they say security trade off without segwit they just mean the channels can't be monitored meaning you have to trust your parties. But this is argued as an issue even with the malleability fix with segwit. 
If you wouldn't mind linking some of these sources you talk about I would be interested to study more. I know there are dozens more similar to the one I linked right now but from what I have read and understand is it can work but not as neat and there are a few trade offs but in terms of offering an off-chain scaling solution it is possible.

Cool, literally everyone I know personally has had a hell of a time understanding coindance and almost instantly gets the link I provided. Maybe stating the avg joe was rash but based on my observance and experience seems to definitely be accurate. I think coindance is better myself. They see segwit2x intention at 88% and don't get what that means then see some BIP 91 chart and don't know what that means. etc.

I don't see why this is bad? Why so hostile?
If someone is trying to collect information and find a solution to the scaling problem that seems like a good thing to me. Why are we demonizing anyone/anything that isn't fucking core/segwit? That seems like a smart thing to do.../s it's not like we are going to implement extension blocks unless there is consensus. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:23:10
Look at ETH and ETC. You can expect something similar to happen with bitcoin if there is a hard fork. As long as those who have access to an implementation that they believe in the prices don't really matter. Eventually merchants will be able to convert from one to the other instantly and at a low cost if the crypto revolution is successful so it won't really matter what you hold. It is more so a matter of achieving low volatility so people can use what they want to use and not worry about losing or gaining money. That is if we are using it as its intended purpose, a currency.

@_date: 2019-05-20 16:13:30
The opposite is true IMO. Bitcoin doesn't have value if you can't fork it infinitely, run a FUD campaign and not have other ideological options on exchanges. Just look at Religion, historically what has happened when people were forced to believe one and punished if they didn't? 
Because the protocol is open source to any one, Forking also alleviates the in-fighting and controversy regarding protocol development. Let those that believe in certain specifications stick to developing them while the others Fork off. Bitcoin is King, many people may not comprehend or understand it yet but many will, and when they do they will come crawling back with the right mindset.

it's not so much just "one" tx in your life, it's a bit more complicated than that. I think you missed their point. If you think you will buy $1000 worth of coffees with them you have to commit $1000 worth of btc to the channel and then you can't use it elsewhere unless they have open channels with other places you want to spend that money. So at that point locking up $1000 of your money may not be worth it to buy 10-20 coffees throughout the month. You may only buy 2-3 before you need the remaining $950 to fix a broken AC unit or what ever. Then you have to close the channel and wait for settlement to have access to that $950
@_date: 2017-06-13 20:10:19
Love the emotion, but the places that accept bitcoin directly almost always convert to FIAT via the same process that using a Shift card would use. 
Relax man, its just a bridge to on board people. People are going from 100% fiat to 100% BTC knowing that they can pay their bills and buy their food with a Shift card when they need. More and more businesses are accepting direct BTC payments and are further more even keeping said payments in BTC. Eventually we will go full circle. but we need this bridge to get there.
