Hahaha that is blatantly false. Even giants such as IBM acknoweldge that Blockchains are superior for supply chain management. Please check out the links below to educate yourself.
And you didn't event answer my 2nd part which was about the ridiculous part why BTC transactions take 2 hours right now. I didn't even mention cost, but yes that is another farce. Might as well use banks.

Nice try though :)

How can you say this? How does Bitcoin manage supply chains like VET? And lol there are so many examples. 
And it literally takes 2 hours right now to transfer a small BTC payment.
