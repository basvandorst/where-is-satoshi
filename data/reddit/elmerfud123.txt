Why have fees and confirmation times suddenly dropped? Just because people have stopped sending so many transactions? Or because more exchanges/wallets are implementing Segwit?
If people start spamming the network again, are we just going to be back to square one of high fees again?

You're right, I'm not a coder and I couldn't code LN myself even if I tried. But that's not the point, I trust the people that are skilled enough to build it.
You saying that it's looking more and more like a scam every day, when in fact you're just ignoring the positive news coming out about it every day, is surely offensive to the coders that are putting in hard work toward it.

It happened because way too many people are trying to get into Bitcoin before the tech is even finished. It's still in development, it's not ready for paying for the gym or a cup of coffee, etc. But thousands of people are jumping on the bandwagon now because they think it's a get rich quick scheme.
It's like if people started buying 3d printers, creating a shortage and causing their prices to skyrocket. You'd have thousands of people that bought into the craze without really knowing what they are, and then complaining that they can't use them to print a new car right now. 
All these people shouldn't be buying cryptos at the moment, unless they are willing to hold onto them until they are actually finished and spendable.

I know lol I tried it but went back to Bread. GreenAddress almost feels like you're using a web browser or something.
@_date: 2018-01-23 05:57:26
Yes it would. The more bullish the price is, the more attention crypto gets. And the more people assume it's 'ready to use'. Then they get disappointed with it and start shitting on it because it's not.

On track to be centralized! Problem solved?
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:41:58
He shouldn't have to. You speak as if you're so sure about it but you obviously don't even keep track of the news, so why? There is news posted on this very sub every day about LN.
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:13:03
wtf is GitHub? Just read the sub every day like the rest of us. And if you don't, then stop pretending you do.

Sending an encrypted message has exactly the same security risk as two people having a private face to face conversation. If criminals want to organise something, they could use either of those two methods. 
The government wants access to listen in to your messages, because you might organise crime through them. By that logic, they also want to listen to any kind of conversation you could have.
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:11:38
Question: Could we just keep track of the address that the crypto was sent to? Until it gets sent to an exchange (I assume they want to sell it for fiat). Then subpoena their ID details from the exchange
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:07:18
GreenAddress supports Segwit. There are a couple more as well I think. I use Bread and am holding out for them to implement it but they're taking their sweet time.
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:36:23
So would it be beneficial to you in any way to broadcast the tx onto the main chain asap? Or is it fine and safe to just leave it in the lightning channel indefinitely?

There is literally one called Bitcoin Pizza
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:06:57
Isn't that exactly what happens though? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:18:10
No, most people would advise you not to invest your entire life savings into anything speculative. Not even the stock market, which is 100x more stable than Bitcoin. Terrible financial advice. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:01:08


Where do you get this idea? This thread is literally people saying that it's not ok.
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:59:12
BTC Markets in Australia already calls BCH 'BCash'. I've always thought it was normal to call it that. Then I realised people on r/BTC were pissed off about it and found it offensive haha but surely if they're so proud of Bitcoin Cash they shouldn't mind it being clearly differentiated from Core? It's almost like they want people to get confused between the two.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:04:34
Bitcoin is not for making a profit

Can confirm, definite FUD

Why are you ordering $1? Maybe there's a minimum limit that you have to buy? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:59:09
This is my approach too. I've mentioned it offhand to some friends before, but just as something that I was interested in. They weren't that interested anyway. Didn't tell them that I've invested. Mainly because like you said, nobody should discuss their investment specifics with anyone else, it's none of their business. 
But also, money can do funny things to people. If they don't invest and they find out that you did, when it rockets they will expect you to share your profits with them. Even though they didn't gamble any of their money on it. If they do invest and it crashes, they'll blame you for losing their money. Best to just keep it to yourself.

So he's going to withdraw $50k in cash and give it to you to disappear into Bitcoin? I'm sure you know what will happen if the IRS notice that on his bank statement or someone tips them off right? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:30:42
You might want to tell us which wallet. Maybe it's just not updating from whatever exchange it's supposed to be checking. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:29:17
Why do you feel bad they're missing out? They're adults, it's their responsibility to research and invest. You had the confidence to do it, they didn't, so they don't get the profits. 
I haven't told my workmates I'm invested because 1. They're always skint and if they see me making money they will feel entitled to a share of it. And 2. If they invest and then they end up losing money, they're gonna point the finger at me. 
Just do your own thing man, it's up to them to do theirs. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:53:39
Asking where the market is going to go is not exactly smart either 
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:19:50
Fucking hell if we could control the value of Bitcoin whenever we wanted, we would all be rich by now. And stop typing Bitcoin in all caps, it's weird. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:06:31
I agree, I actually have both on my iPhone but prefer Bread because it's a lot smoother, looks better and just seems a bit more reliable. I only downloaded GreenAddress because I wanted to experiment with Segwit to see if it could save me money on fees. But I set up payments of the same amount at the same time from both wallets, and Greenaddress said the fee would be more. Not sure how that works.
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:58:20
Ah ok I thought you meant the bar accepted BTC. Do you have to pay a conversion fee or anything with BTC debit card? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:45:42
If you receive 10 transactions to the same address, your keys are all at that address right? So when you decide to transfer it all out, your transfer fees should be cheaper than if you had received at 10 different addresses and wanted to transfer it all out? 
Or is this not how it works? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:51:16
So you paid the bar in AUD? Or BTC? I'm confused lol 
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:27:04
Most I've ever paid for fees is $7 lol and that's not even Segwit

Look at the sidebar, use the search function and visit r/BitcoinBeginners. All of your questions have been answered already, multiple times a day. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:26:34
Do they have to implement it like they do with Segwit? What's the difference? And if LN turned up tomorrow, which would make more sense for them to implement first? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:01:55
Side bar. Search bar. These questions have been answered literally hundreds of times on this sub alone.

BTC Markets. I don't think any Aussie exchanges use Segwit yet. And hardly any iOS wallets do either. Great for me :/
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:48:16
Yeah your friend needs to learn about it and do it himself. You can sit with him at the computer and do it with him. But when it comes to tax time or some kind of audits, it should be his responsibility. Or if Bitcoin crashes, he's going to blame you for losing his money. 
Also, why are you using localbitcoins.com? Sign him up to an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 10:45:00
I was reading a post on r/BTC earlier about how BTC fees are often $500 and they were all kicking off about it lol people gotta make transactions themselves instead of just believing everything they read 
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:29:14
I don't get why people rip on him for doing it. It's not like he knew how it would be valued in the future. The first caveman to find a golden nugget might have traded it for a fucking chicken if he wanted, we don't take the piss out of him for doing that just because it's increased in value today.

You know the terms 'shill' and 'fud' perfectly, but you've never heard of Lightning Network? 
Also you literally posted an article about LN 12 days ago. Did you not read it?

He's just making it harder for us to argue against the general public who say that crypto are just pump n dump schemes. It's not going to help mainstream adoption if n00bs are constantly being misled and fucked over by rich people's insider trading.

Yeah it was always about bringing regulations in. But the media reported it as 'South Korea is banning Bitcoin', that's why everyone started panicking and selling.

Yeah he's trying to make out like BTC is just another altcoin alongside all the others. Trying to bring it down to a level playing field with BCH.
