Just some facts on the products.
1.All our NFC related products are NTAG203, We have been using this chip for the past 2 years and has been reliable and able to be read by Android, Iphone (cases), windows Phone and BB.
2. The PVC cards are single chip cards, We have experimented with 2 chips but need to work on the solution more as proximity to multiple writers can be a pita. We will probably provide the duel cards with a anti fraud screen to make it easier to write.
3. the merchant signs are designed for users who can write their public key to the embedded chip as well as print off a 55 x 55 sticker of the QR, We have an app in the works that will make this process easier for merchants.
4. We are all about closing the merchant gap and making it easier for a merchant to just accept Bitcoin out the gate. The signs are heavy duty PVC printed on both sides.
5. We freight from Australia today but have some shipping arrnagements being nutted out in Asia, Europe and USA.
6.We only accept Bitcoin.. why would we do it any other way ? right?

Merchant signs - street busker encodes a wallet address into the nfc portion of that sticker AND prints out a QR code that matches the sticker.- Stick to guitar case - Punter walks past and taps his NFC phone with NFC enabled wallet and as he walks away tfers some bitcoin to the busker!

The reason both is for the Iphone vs the world of mobile argument.. they all NFC except for the iPhone that may never become it..unless Bitcoin actually forces them to via NFC.
We actually think that Bitcoin and NFC are a perfect marriage and could be the shovel in the ass for Apple to force adoption, maybe :)
