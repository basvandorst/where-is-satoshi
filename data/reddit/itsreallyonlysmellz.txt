One day old account, talking trash about researchers.
@_date: 2016-04-26 01:22:31
Wow, you really have ad hominem attacks down! And when those fail, argue against tone! The only strange part in all of this is that your initial post was haughty, snarky, and downright condescending, so you don't get to use those words.
Face it, your story didn't make sense. Attacking the people who are trying to talk some sense into you only digs a deeper hole.
@_date: 2016-04-25 22:29:37


Not at all. Rovion seems to have communicated with Bob exclusively using the m0money address. How did Rovion discover this address and know to reach out to Bob there? 
If Rovion had penetrated Bob's desktop to the point of knowing his secret email address, why would he not already have obtained Bob's keys to carry out the hack?
I'll mark this one as still outstanding.


If we assume that the initial flag is resolved, there's a bigger and more disconcerting question to be answered next: how did you end up losing money to someone that stupid?
Marking this one unresolved.


Ok, unexplained.




Your guess? Do you not understand what the professor is telling you? 
Computer security doesn't work through guesses and gut calls. It works by carefully checking every detail. 
Marking it unresolved.


So you gave your robber significant amounts of cash, in return for a story that you did not bother to check out? Isn't that what the professor said?


I don't know, your account involving the guy's race rubbed me the wrong way as well. Why mention it at all? The professor is right in that you clearly spent some time on this issue.


Ok. I can understand this. 


You know what? You deserve that snark, and far more, for believing and repeating a cockamamie story.
You were schooled by the professor in computer security. In that field, you cannot make any assumptions or fill any gaps based on gut feelings. You have to carefully check every detail. You need to be skeptical about all hearsay. Especially when that hearsay is coming from your attacker.
Instead, your whole account was one long juicy story. Sure, things may have happened that way. Or they may have happened in myriad other ways. The bottom line is you just don't know. And now your ego is tied up in it, so you'll continue to stick to this dumb story at the expense of your site's security.
Can't wait to see the next hack!

I don't want sidechains, just curious why they were so overhyped, and why they fizzled out in the end.

                         ^^^^^^^^^
Thank you for continuing to mock that idiot.
Kinoshi, I know all about script. The point you are trying to make might seem very complicated and deep to you, but to everyone else, you look cringeworthy. 
There is such a concept as an "address" in Bitcoin. Addresses don't need to correspond to some *physical storage in a fixed location* in order to exist. If your understanding of the world is limited only to physical things with concrete, fixed locations, you're just not on the level -- more like a third grader trying to talk about physics to college students. Even the inanimate crypto_bot is mocking you every time you post. Get the hint.
P.S. You're going to next tell me that crypto_bot does not exist. Where in the reddit database is crypto_bot, eh? Answer me that! But it's mocking you, that's undeniable. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 05:41:24
Frankly, this post nails it. We should be able to make the case for increasing the fees slightly and getting rid of low value junk from the blockchain without dancing around the issue. No shame in explicitly making a case for higher fees, which is all that he is asking for. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 14:47:24
You are making the case first made by these academics:
I remember when their paper first came out. Everyone attacked these guys. It took 3 years for everyone to change their tune and start parroting the observations they made in the first place.

You still left out any mention of NG, which offers scalability far beyond any of the reparameterization ideas that are being pushed around.  It also provides quantitative metrics for issues that you seem unable to get sorted out.

You are out of date by at least a year, if not more. That code is already in the Core. The fee estimation development has been going on since 2012, and my Mycelium client already has the fee estimator in it.
@_date: 2015-12-24 07:50:21
No, the discussion around RBF had little to do with client software and everything to do with merchants who accept 0-conf. Completely different story.
I'm not going get into the blocksize debate here. I personally don't care about the outcome. Would just like to see it resolved clearly and build things on top, where I think the action actually is. 
@_date: 2015-12-26 17:16:41
Thanks, for completely destroying that idiot and his idiotic argument.

I'm looking at online measures.
@_date: 2015-12-25 14:17:22
Why do we still not have properly functioning (trustless, 2 way pegged) sidechains, so long after the sidechain idea was first published?
@_date: 2015-12-24 08:09:01
I see that you're trying to be obnoxious because I pointed out that the fee estimation work goes back to 2012. I'm sorry. But it does. And you were out of date. I cannot change the past and make you a more clueful person. You didn't realize something, and I tried to help by cluing you in.
Since I'm not a big block proponent, your crazy effort to pick the block size fight with me is not going to work.
Can we just be nice to each other? We probably all want the same thing: a moon trip, paid for with bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-12-25 18:33:31
Very cool and interesting. Can I ask (a) which alternative client, (b) why you're running something other than the default? aren't you taking on the risk of a fork? and (c) why did you compile it like that?

Hey, i'm trying! Would love to show what we're doing, but it's hard to do without doxxing our company.

This is true, the efficient market hypothesis requires that all relevant information be available to all.
@_date: 2015-12-24 07:54:26
How often was there an actual backlog? &lt;10% of the time?
So why would you expect to see a distribution when there is no backlog? What makes you think (besides wild conjecture) this is a hardcoded, flat default, and not the fee estimator doing its job and picking the minimum hardcoded fee? Why should it pay more than the bare minimum necessary?
@_date: 2015-12-27 02:55:07
A wall of text that leaves out [the most sensible approach to date on how to scale Bitcoin]( 
@_date: 2015-12-25 14:22:25
Remember how sidechains were sold as a scalability measure, but turned out to require more transactions on the main chain than normal?
LN will turn out to be a bust and all the torquing we did to the protocol to accommodate it will be for naught. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 18:34:56
Interesting point about how long science takes to get accepted. I would have hoped that a tech savvy audience would be better, but you're right. 
BTW, that paper wasn't about small fast blocks, but  all about how nodes have no incentive to ferry transactions to miners. So Joe here wants to make a payment? Tough luck, what's it to me, I'll just drop it on the floor.
Happy holidays!
@_date: 2015-12-25 15:52:46
If core devs can't dev, they should be core forum posters. 
It's funny that you admit that sidechains are just vaporware and hype, but some idiot has downvoted my comments.


Yeah, woo hoo. Peter can pretend he did something.
@_date: 2015-12-25 14:51:15


Ok, so it sounds like this is a condition with more fees, yes?


Ok, so it sounds like you want to bring this condition on earlier, yes?


See, it's toxic crap like this that makes you look bad. You end up making a case for higher fees sooner, but then claiming that you want something else, or that your argument is simplified, or whatever. 
You want your argument not presented by other people? Learn to make it yourself, using honest language.

I totally agree. I've had enough of their drama. 
Also, I don't understand why someone has to badmouth and/or cripple every competing thing out there to sell a non-existent product. If Bitcoin succeeds, there'll be so much money for everyone to make a living. If it fails, no one will want LN. I don't understand why this is so hard to see.

No way. Hardly ever exceeded 10K every time I checked.

Do you even know what the word "semantics" means?
It means meaning. We're discussing the meaning of the phrase, because you are misusing it. Read the goddamned article and then make a case for higher fees. Sick and tired of this "developing the fee market" crap. It's a thinly veiled attempt to raise fees.
@_date: 2015-12-26 01:45:36
So, wait, the big claim to fame by this company is that they took the hash of some public books that are part of the Gutenberg Project and put it on the blockchain???
They seem to have no core technical competency.
@_date: 2016-01-05 16:46:55
You seem confused, but too caught up in your own rhetoric to realize why. Those three dinky market mechanisms that you tout as if they are interesting, are not. Miners don't work the way you think they do. Let me illustrate with this:


No, there isn't a single market. Every miner offers a good, a block, and transactions bid for those spots with fees. The miner then uses his own selection criteria to award those slots. 
Consequently, each miner implements his own market, with his own criteria. There isn't a singular "market."


Sounds like you don't want to live with the consequences of your choices.


That's false, the people doing the "spamming" are not the large-block proponents. You can say that large-block proponents want to lower the fees, which will increase "spam." That's a legitimate argument that has been made by many. 


Got it, you want something to happen one way, but you don't want the consequences of having it happen that way.
It doesn't sound like this discussion will resolve itself. This one parameter has become a bike-shedding event, and I hope that something drastically different will come along, either LN or NG, and just do away with it.

Not right. Miners provide no utility. All utility stems from the ability to trade digital goods with actual goods that provide said utility. That is, they come from the users.


True. Value comes from the demand side, not the miners, who supply nothing but fungible tokens.


Not the point of the post, and not exactly right. Did you read the post? Your comment isn't exactly wrong, but it's the kind of word soup that the BitPay CEO was engaging in when he got called out.

@_date: 2016-01-01 20:22:40
This is dumbassery dressed up to look insightful without containing any insight.
When there is a good (space) that can be disbursed by multiple people (miners), there will be as many market mechanisms as there are miners. Your suggested techniques are not comprehensive. One of them ( will plainly always be non-applicable to Bitcoin. You're just offering up filler material.
Then you try to criticize the article for not following your broken logic. It's a good thing it didn't. And the article clearly says that there are many reasons to support small blocks. The effect of small blocks is to raise fees, that part is undeniable. You need to admit that that's the end result you want, and then justify it. Your pathetic comment tried to do this by mentioning "security and censorship resistance." Now **make that case**. With numbers. And valid arguments. What you offer up in your comment is just pure empty BS.
@_date: 2016-03-06 15:28:33
There are actual scientists who work on Bitcoin and who have maintained an unbiased view.
I don't know that they can create reconciliation, but at least can call out ways to resolve questions that are technical in nature. Can we measure the decentralization effect? Can we quantify people's concerns instead of waving our hands? etc etc.
The problem is, on every issue, one of the sides will not be willing to debate publicly and scientifically, because their position is backed by gut feel and not fundamental science.

That was a terrible article. Let's put aside our own feelings aside about LE and BTC, and figure out what happened:
Did the FBI have a warrant or not? If not, that's a huge breach, though there are secondary questions about Gary Davis's citizenship that come into play and whether this constituted a national security issue (in my opinion it did not, but again, our own opinions don't matter).
If they did have a warrant, on what grounds is Microsoft upset at the FBI?

No, cipher-block chaining is a different thing. Blockchains go back at least to the AT&amp;T paper on timestamp services. The specific name doesn't matter -- Satoshi himself does not use the phrase "block chain" in the white paper.

My money is on you being a vitriolic asshole. Let's look at *the passage you quoted*:


So, no matter what you put in the "signiture" file, you cannot fool verification. If it checks out, you are verifying a signature that must have come from Satoshi.
Let's read the next paragraph, because you failed to do so in your vitriolic rage:


The post clearly laid out exactly what went wrong, and exactly what would be wrong if the "signiture" file had been replaced. The problem was that the signature (or the "signiture") were over the wrong hash. The errors were misdirection attempts.
I saw your other posts, why the rabid anger? It doesn't compensate for lack of reading skills you know.

You've failed reading comprehension and crypto.

Bottom line: a signature that verifies must have been a signature that came from Satoshi. The real problem here, as noted in the article, was that the signature was over the wrong hash, it was a replay.
