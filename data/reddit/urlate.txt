Right this is getting confusing Zane says all coins were held with Bitgo you say "If you didn't do this then you don't have a BitGo wallet." well I never signed anything with Bitgo so do I have a bitgo address or not?
I'm really curious what wallet held any btc that was purchased by me on margin because I have looked at all the address associated with my account and see none of these margin coins delivered to me.
So the question is shouldn't this Bitgo address that is supposedly associated with me be listed in my account and if so I certainly never saw one.

Meaning if he didn't sell those btc for fiat then he's still holding btc meaning it's about to be worth a lot less when the exchange opens.

You need to be realistic with the situation.
I have read a lot of suggestions on moving forward, everything from tokens to haircuts but there are two things you need to consider before getting your hopes up.
Unless everyone is made whole and the exchange can open without a hitch and withdraws opened any other option will be met with lawsuits and government interventions.
Bitfinex doesn't have the resources to fight off worldwide litigation from it's users or governments so suggesting tokens or haircuts is not an option right now. Bitfinex needs to find enough liquidity to cover what they cannot afford to payout and a plan to restructure otherwise bankruptcy is inevitable.
I myself was a victim of Gox now this.

And they have an obligation with the information they pass is correct, coherent and consistent.
I don't see that when Zane comes on Reddit and nearly every single day gives different timelines for a restart of the website. If you don't know then you don't know and that's being honest. 
You stick to one script and simply say look people it's a complicated task we are moving as quickly as we can Bitfinex will be open in due course.
What you don't do is come in Reddit and everyday say things like it's going to be today oh wait tomorrow it should be tonight well we did plan on it yesterday but now maybe another day. That's not coherent and consistent information.
What you don't do is come on Reddit and say we are discussing a haircut oh wait we really are not sure if that will happen but how about you guys give us some ideas what you think.
That's not coherent.
You don't know yet then you don't know stick to one script, look people we are exploring all our options after we have finalized our mission moving forward we will post this on our website but for now we are focused on damage control and getting operations back to normal.
coherent, consistent, correct information

The only peoples account that will be dealt with are the ones affected so for instance if you were holding a margin long and your account was not one of the accounts affected then you will get screwed when the exchange opens by the sudden drop in price however if you were holding a short you're in the money

Nice so essentially you're burning a boat load of traders who get margin called on launch because the bots will drive the price down faster than a trader can get online to close out their position.
Good job.

OMFG now you're saying "we think we can get it up toady"! 
Just 1hr ago you said and I quote; "We don't have an exact time that we can get the site up, however.".
Here you're giving more  contradictory responses;
"I'm pretty sure we'll get it up today. We made a lot of progress yesterday and our team is quite confident it'll go up today." 
"We are planning to bring the site back up today, i know i said this yesterday as well and i apologize for missing this deadlines, but we're working as hard as we can to bring everything back online and are confident we'll be able to do it today." 
"We're trying as hard as we can to get it up today. We made a lot of progress with settling positions and balances yesterday, but there's still a lot of work to be done. I'll continue to post updates as i have them."

I'm curious if according to the cftc paper margin coins needed to be delivered to my bitcoin address at Bitfinex why is it that when I was holding a btc margin long position the btc doesn't show on on the blockchain as being delivered to my bfx address?
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:32:23
No he said "I was closing my long positions" not I did. Meaning the site went down when he was in the process.
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:32:29
I think you need to understand the gravity of the situation, there are over 38 Million in open long positions at BFX. You can't exactly roll back these positions or close them simply because there is no one to close them to. 
If trading is resumed rest assured there simply is not enough chairs to go around because the music has already stopped and the current spot price is $538 a full $66 from where BFX was at when it went offline. 
Any astute trader who was trading through the api will be quickly getting ready to close their position faster than most can.

Oh they wont be rolling back anyone except those affected by the hack that's been written by Zane already.
So all those holding a margin long not affected when the exchange does come back online will be at a severe loss while those holding a short position just got a steak and lobster lunch gifted to them for free via BItfinex.

What you should be worried about is the epic PR disaster you guys are creating.
You flip flip on when you're opening your site.
You leak life changing information about socialized losses being a potential then flip flop yet again by saying anything is up for discussion.
If you actually knew anything about impact limitation you would keep your mouth shut until a concrete plan was in place on exactly what you are going to do moving forward and in the mean time focus on bringing the website back up without spreading any information about anything to do with withdraws or trading resumption or making users whole.
You haven't even managed to restart your website and instead all you've managed to do is cause more anxiety with users by coming on Reddit and posting conflicting information that may or may not happen.
Zane until you actually know for 100% certainty what is going on stop filling users heads with all these numerous ideas Bitfinex has only to backtrack and say well nothing is for sure at the moment.

Trusting Bitfinex again is like trusting an ex-pedophile with your children simply because they say it wont happen again. 
 
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:47:25
Right but according to the Bitfinex TOS I am only hung out to dry for any theft from my account.
The question is to what address did these margin long coins go to and if associated with me where can I find it.
Because currently all my bfx address show none of the coins I bought on margin so if they were never delivered to me then I never owned them.
@_date: 2016-08-04 05:07:36
Not sure the hostility to this idea as it will actually help the miners, Bitfinex and the community.
They now have half the reward so they need the price of Bitcoin to remain relatively high for ROI so it's actually a win for the miners and Bitfinex to keep Bitfinex alive and solvent.
This could also deter future large scale hacks as a side benefit.
Seems win win for everyone.
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:03:30
Mt.Gox tried to do the same thing and look what happened to them. You think anyone would capitalize a company whos users would clearly run for the exit at first chance?

"Use a regulated exchange".
If you think regulation is going to help you I invite you to speak to the victims of Bernie Sanders. In one of the most regulated countries in the world (USA) people were fleeced for billions.
There is no such thing as a fully insured Bitcoin exchange. The only thing insurance will cover are the US dollars not Bitcoin.
Even Gemini doesn't have insurance for Bitcoin only USD.

Raise 30 Million in new equity in the open market, socialize the other 30 or 40 mill remaining to Bitfinex users, give the investors and affected Bitfinex users a corporate bond that Bitifnex will create that is interest bearing which can come from trading fees and can be redeemed at a lower specified date for the original investors and on a secondary date for BItfinex users to cut in half the amount Bitfinex needs to pay at any one time.
The bond users will hold can then be sold or traded on Bitfinex to interested investors under a corporate bond section of your website.
Job done everyone happy.

Right but with every other exchange tanking because of this hack traders holding long positions are now screwed 
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:55:23
That's only for people affected by the hack all others are screwed. When the market opens anyone holding a long will have a lot less capital in there account when the price at bfx goes from 604 to 580 in a flash crash 
@_date: 2016-08-17 04:33:47
Let me ask you something genius what good will an injunction do on a bank account with most if not all of the funds moved? 
You don't think the operators of BFX didn't think of this as possible scenario? 
A lot of money is tied up in virtual currencies which can be moved as simply as creating paper wallets. The cash can be wired out of their registered bank accounts if it already hasn't.
When there are millions at stake I'm fairly certain they would have brain stormed every possible situation that could arise and figured out a solution that best serves their interests.

@_date: 2016-08-04 18:05:19
It all boils down to which accounts borrowed USD or BTC to enter a position including the lenders and was ultimately stolen by the hacker.
It's a lottery essentially. If you bought or sold or lent funds and the btc associated with that transaction was stolen you are affected, if you didn't you wont be.
However what is confusing is that the actual btc stolen should be the responsibility of it's owner, simply put the entire responsibility of financial loss would rest on the shoulders of the account holder that had btc removed from their account and less so on the lender or borrower unless the btc was transferred to the borrowers account.

Exactly and don't take my word for it zane wrote it already:
[–]zanetackett[S] [score hidden] 9 minutes ago 
May i ask where this 6:00 UTC number is coming from? Positions that were directly affected will be settled using the price as of 18:00 UTC, positions that were not directly affected will remain unchanged upon relaunch. At least this is my understanding at this time, our plans for what we do upon relaunch are not yet solidified so i can't say concretely one way or the other, but i will continue to post updates on this as they become available.

Its nice you're thinking about yourself but there are millions in longs from way up in the 600's and right now the price on stamp is 566 so I wonder where BFX is headed when they open.
@_date: 2016-08-07 04:33:06
I doubt an exchange which gives it's users a 36% loss on their account will have any new or current users flocking to it.
I would honestly say the only people who are going to still be around after BFX opens are the ones holding these BFX IOU's in the hopes they can redeem them. 
BFX is done even if they are lucky enough to stay open they will have volume less than any exchange in service today or in the future.

wrong that's only for people affected by the hack, all those holding btc long positions are about to be margin called when the market opens.
Remember there are 38mill in open long positions and when the market opens below 580 like the other exchanges instead of 604 where we were at before the site went down, you are going to see the mother of all margin cascade

@_date: 2016-08-06 05:20:22
Perhaps but the real question I was alluding to refers to where the coins that were purchased on margin got delivered to.
The reason for this is because the Bitfinex TOS explicitly states any btc that gets stolen from me on bfx is my responsibility the thing is I have yet to find that these coins I bought on margin were ever delivered to me, and if they were never delivered to me I never owned them and if I never owned them then I wouldn't be liable for any loss to the margin provider that gave me the money to buy them it would be between the owner of the coins and the lender.
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:25:14
No it wont due to what will be very heavy market volatility when they open.

I think you hold Bitfinex in too high of a regard.
When you decided to leave money with their business this is what you were signing up to.
1: They are located in a virtual office in HK under an LLC business licence. Which means you don't actually know where they are.
2: The only way of communicating with Bitfinex is by way of email or Reddit posts, by this I mean they have no telephone number or physical address apart from their virtual office details.
3: They created a TOS to ensure they put any and all liability with their customer.
4: The owners are an elusive group of individuals scattered across the globe meaning that trying to figure out the logistics of who what and where anything is at any given moment is a large task.
5: They have banks in Taiwan, Registered in the BVI and HK as a money transmitter.
I think the real question that needs to be answered is why you didn't do your due diligence and read up on what you were getting yourself into before doing business with this company?
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:04:52
What wasn't wise was not treating this much money more responsibly by not storing that much capital online to be taken and now you try and convince us by saying;
 "We cannot bring any part of the site up before we are certain that we have a secure environment".
If you couldn't secure the environment the first time around what makes you think you can do it a second?

lel, No one is talking about centralizing Bitcoin. If anything is centralized it's the price of Bitcoin. You must think that when you transfer Bitcoin to an exchange what you're essentially doing is transferring your funds to your own private wallet and not a "centralized" exchanges wallet. You must also think that when Bitcoin is traded it's done so in an open p2p marketplace and not an independently owned and operated "centralized" exchange.  Rolls eyes.
