Just to be clear, the fees you are complaining about are not the result of how bitcoin work, but how the exchange is charging you for moving cash in and out.  You don't need to use them, you could find a person and hand him cash for bitcoin, and they could send you some and then you can find a person to sell your coin to.  Granted, that is a total pain in the ass, so most people use an exchange.  However, sending your bitcoin will also be a bitcoin transaction fee which you can control, to some degree, depending on how fast you want it confirmed. 
A second point, you don't have to use coinbase itself for buying and selling your coins, you could use GDAX and save yourself money with limit buy/sells versus the slightly raised price you pay coinbase which basically does a market order.

If no one sells, then no one can buy, and thus the price can not go up or down.

See if your app allows you to adjust the transaction fee vs. speed of the transaction.  My last 13 transactions averaged $1.12 tx fee.  However, I noticed my phone app used higher transaction fees than other methods.

Replace "complaining" with "My issue is with" if that sounds better.  I'm just trying to clarify for you where the fees are from so you can avoid them.  To help you learn, if you will.

How do you handle coins gained by hard forks, then sold?  It doesn't really have a "cost basis."
