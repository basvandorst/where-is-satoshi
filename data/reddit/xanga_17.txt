What fed? I didn’t see anything on this.
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:32:27
I thought bitcoin will be $8000 right now. I went to work and stopped looking at the price today and not caring about what will happen. If we knew it will rebound we would have bought. Too many people were scared. The good thing is I didn’t sell anything.

Tether is backed by altcoins. This is it. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:30:24
The news is tethers printed. People opened Longs and now they bleeding from the behind. Whales taking advantage of the tether printing news. Bitcoin will go up hopefully soon.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:42:57
Look at how many margin trade liquidated today. Huge profits or losses lol.
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:18:50
Your broke ass can’t afford buying it for $1.

My money is gone.
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:22:39
Peaked at 20k and then down to 10.5k then 14k. I am afraid we are going down for a big ride soon.
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:56:33
My cousin did this when bitcoin was 7k now it is almost 12k. He wants to buy more if he can lol. I meant he maxed his cards not open a bunch of new ones.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:53:23
I see a patter here. It is becoming more stable if this pattern continues.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:56:14
There will be few winners and a whole lotta losers (90%) I am expecting.
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:18:10
Monero will make you go to jail soon. Articles already published few days ago about Government not wanting anonymous money transfers.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:52:06
Price will be 100k a coin. Everyone will jump in.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:21:51
Many people got burned by them in the past and lost all their coins. They remain outside the US to prevent class action lawsuit. People lost millions and bitfinex did nothing to help.
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:04:37
I agree with your scenario. It’s a win/win if you sell BTC at a profit and short the futures. Buying more BTC can make your principal decline which is a negative event for profit hoping for others to buy as well to increase the coin price which is not always guaranteed to work.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:30:20
So many sellers at 12k if you look at coinbase. Scary lol.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:50:05
Let’s hack them lol.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:21:30
If you buy at 11k and transfer it out and it reaches 50k in couple years you only pay tax on the 11k. Good tip for everyone.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:27:06
500k is enough to retire in most places in the world. However, in Egypt you just need 250k. I am really surprised why not many people are retiring. I am going to retire next year.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:05:05
I am not sure. I am assuming it is high like always.  If the price crashes it would be messy. Lol
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:17:05
On gdax it did. People were able to buy at 18k and 19k a coin. I know I bought at 17.5k and got burned.
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:48:40
500k can get you 50k/yr from interest if you have wealthy relatives or from stocks. For me, I just need 5k/yr to spend on food and apartment. I am a simple guy.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:49:38
I believe they manipulate the market to screw margin traders going long. Simple.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:45:33
Wait until bitfinex is announcing a hack. Do not leave your coins there and do not believe them. It will be internal and they will pretend that they don’t know who did it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:47:27
I can help fund over 150k if I am allowed to live next to the mining site. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:33:07
Satoshi Nakamoto is against the Government. He wanted money to transfer peer to peer not through exchanges like these days. He failed because his ideas will never be implemented because it can destroy the system. Satoshi tried to help but the Government stopped him. The human slave is not allowed to transfer money anonymously peer to peer. The slave must provide his/her name and KYC info to buy/sell.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:16:47
It was over 19k and went to 13k the next day. This is a dip. Bitcoin is popular so the dip didn’t last long.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:30:40
The big short. Lmao

You can teach yourself programming if you are disciplined. The quicker you are at learning the better the chances to land a job.

Putin alone owns 90% of the bitcoins lol. New technological advances come from the Government. Too many Russians working  in the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-08-21 07:27:56
The federal reserve that controls the money supply isn’t owned by the government and the secretive board members receive your federal income tax. Do you think they will let you destroy their dollar? They can destroy bitcoin within a minute if they want to. If you really want to change things then make sure the government release the names of these people stealing all federal tax income from everyone in the country.
@_date: 2018-10-01 16:23:08
At least in USA you can sue them successfully.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:01:30
Bch is better than both. Look how much it grew in 1 day. btc can never grow this big. Wait until more exchanges list it and btc will go back to zero.
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:06:44
There is a website that tracks profitability. Today is the first day bitcoin cash mining is becoming profitable. New miners joined as well. Big things happening.
@_date: 2018-10-10 18:49:38
When I used to go on coinbase the price of bitcoin kept going up and up and up little at a time for a long time BUT it take a couple seconds to crash the price and it goes up and up and up little at a time for a while. The point of my post is that at coinbase the price seemed like it was going up all the time.
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:21:23
Come on. New coin with lots of hype has to be pumped by whales. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 20:44:40
Pumping billions and dumping them.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:49:53
Bitcoin cash mining profitability rose to 140% today and it is growing against btc core. Expect bitcoin cash to reach $1500+ soon. The effect of the split didn't happen august 1st. It might occur this weekend.
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:52:23
They is why. You scared me lol. Bittrex been fast and liquid to me so I been using it instead the other slow exchanges.
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:15:11
$8400 lol
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:43:19
What if there is vpn?
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:50:19
When tether goes down bitcoin will be back at $1500 a piece lol. People are scared because it can happen in a blink of an eye.
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:58:29
Miners jumped back to mine a lot of bitcoin in the last few hours so expect a new ATH. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:38:09
It’s only because bch is more profitable to mine. Look at it again 1 day from now and then bitcoin core is more profitable and you will see so many people losing LOADS of $$ from Bitcoin Cash. Isn’t it obvious? You just need to look at a website and it will tell you when bch is less profitable. Currently it is less than 24 hours from now.
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:29:53
Bittrex announced it will give both. Go look it up.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:38:54
I️ know but I️ see miners currently wanting to fork.

Nigeria and India are not too far apart. I will be ready to send you the fees if you want to send me some coins.  /s

I saw that. If true he is going to make a killing from his sheep investors.
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:49:28
You might want to short bitcoin as it continues to fall.
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:27:40
Were you verified or not? If yes then this is a big problem and I won’t deposit any more money there.
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:21:05
Once you buy it take days or weeks to get your coins unless you pay with a credit card and their limits are lower compared to checking account.
@_date: 2017-11-05 10:00:51
If bch succeeds then it will be available in Korea that’s all. This is where most of the supporters from.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:52:45
The tethers lol they going to crush us.
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:07:38
You sold at market price. I hope that wasn’t during the big crash because there was flash crash that screwed a lot of people that day. Price flash crashed to $900 on bittrex I believe. Other exchanges may vary.
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:30:24
Ver was in federal prison and The only known developer in their team is a liar. Of course Bcrash going to screw people eventually.

@_date: 2017-11-14 12:18:28
This been happening for a while now. Every morning Bitcoin Cash pumps and then it dumps later on. It is affecting bitcoin price. Once enough people are burned by BCH they will stop day trading it!
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:57:16
Bitfinex printed $20 million dollars worth of tether today causing the nice bump.
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:41:05
If this is true then don’t sell your 2x coins until you see what’s going to happen. This is still profitable because you will have 2 coins and 1 will be the winner so you will sell the loser.
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:45:01
Wall Street pumps them and months later they dump them.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:03:51
Price is going to be volatile more than it is now. Prepare a lot of cash on the exchange and follow the waves and come out a millionaire.
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:01:55
After the fork when hash rate becomes too low it will take months to recover. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:21:10
Bitcoin is useless. It is similar to Ponzi scheme. It won’t grow if no new people buying and it can’t compete with visa/MasterCard in term of speed, cost, and efficiency. Whales pump it big on good news and they crash it big on bad news. That’s all folks.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:15:50
Volatility is good. Day traders want that. One day someone will control the price of bitcoin and make it stable.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:27:54
30 million tethers reduce bitcoin by $300 according to bitfinexed. It shouldn’t be a big deal.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:32:11
Why you guys so negative? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:30:08
Remove their volume and see what bitcoin will be without them.
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:50:27
Probably Koreans since most of volume from there.
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:43:31
You should have waited until after the fork. X2 free coin is worth $1800 now.
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:31:00
Would you guys tip me if I make a prediction for tomorrow on bitcoin and altcoins that comes out to be true?
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:43:57
Currently it is 2x more profitable until tomorrow. Expect the biggest crash ever in Bitcoin Cash by tomorrow night (24 hours from now).
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:34:10
I sold and I thought I made a lot but my order didn’t go though so I had to wait until price went up again to cash out and I did. Now the price fluctuates too fast it is difficult to trade Bcrash lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:51:12
True. Buy more lol

I️ just read a report from a miner published 11/1. They are trying to stop bitcoin core. They are waiting for today/tomorrow for the new difficulty adjustment for bitcoin and they are moving away from bitcoin to mine Bitcoin Cash. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:58:50
The fork is happening even if just bitmain miners alone supporting it.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:13:47
Facts from a Redditor of 2 days. Bitcoin without the hash rate can go down to $200 a piece. Save up your money folks for the dip.

@_date: 2017-10-23 16:19:08
It take few weeks until people sell their bitcoin gold safely and by then we will have the 2nd fork so price shouldn’t fall to 5000 anytime soon. Just my opinion.

I have a feeling Rothschild family is behind it. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 11:49:57
