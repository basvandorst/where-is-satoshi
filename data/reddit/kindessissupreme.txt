The idea of Bitcoin is with me for eternity.
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:26:50
So what's the worth of an unverified account? Why would someone sell it and want would the buyer gain from it? 
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:47:24
Was using mycelium, now trying to use electrum, 
And yeah saw it almost a month ago, did not know hot to double spend so decided to wait, and just got back my crypto day before yesterday, I decide to get Abit more Bitcoin, and wake up to the confirmed transactions, yes I did neglect on my part lol sigh 
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:06:12
So what's the seed for? And is a private key the same as a seed?? 
Also, why is there 8private keys 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:29:50
Well I'd rather just buy when it's cheap and just hold hoping it will go back up. I mean I'm not about to keep on checking over and over again, if it does go up, I'll definitely make some money of it, crypto1010
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:41:30
Takes like 2 weeks, I had an issue with my transaction, took almost a week or 2 to get it back cause my low fees which was like 150sat/byte wasn't enough for any kind of confirmation
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:59:54
Is there any stats out there which show how much a day trader makes and what the win:lose ratio might be most of the time? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:05:55
I've been holding since 2015, I will hold for eternity.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:19:26
Of course I did that I just do not understand the jargon that much and I'm not getting a clear answer, I just need to know what having 8 private keys means since u thought there would only be one for each account?
@_date: 2018-01-22 10:48:24
So why do people think they would earn more since they can get more coins with other cheaper coins? 
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:14:34
Which one can hold alot of different type of cryptos?
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:53:33
No idea, I'm just really paranoid now 
@_date: 2018-01-04 08:58:22
I did not receive a private key though, all I got was a seed which I had to write down ( 12 words) , is that the same thing? 
@_date: 2018-01-02 10:55:44
It's great! But one question, do I have to do the double spending? Or can I wait it out and get back my crypto? Thing is the transaction keeps refreshing in a way ( resending) so do I wait it out or do I have to do this to get back my crypto? Thanks alot man!
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:30:51
Ohh okok get it, binance is being sold for 0.5btc and bittrex for 0.8btc , is it worth that much? 
@_date: 2018-01-28 06:40:52
I have an electrum wallet but no idea how to implement segwit on it? Any ideas ? 
@_date: 2018-01-04 08:45:43
So guessing only when I'm sending out it will ask that from me? I still haven't withdrawn from the electrum wallet 
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:08:37
So I just have to create a new electrum wallet? It the default would be a segwit wallet? 
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:34:15
Yeah I get that, but I was checking if quantity makes a difference , 
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:40:14
So I should create a new electrum multisig wallet, got it lol 
Thanks I'll try that out today and see how it goes
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:24:28
So all I need is the seed? Wrote it on paper and that's it, no keys though! 
Thanks for the help! 
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:58:41
I have my master seed written down, I have a pincode for the app too, 
Using the one plus ,  just got a notification to upgrade to os 4.5.15 so guessing whatever comes right before 
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:39:34
Damn so missed the fork? 
Will my electrum wallet have the fork though ? And is the fork directly correlated with segwit ? 
Also, we are on segwit2 now yes?
Sorry for the noobish questions trying to figure it out 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:15:32
Lmao leave kenyans alone 
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:05:06
Okay, I see a transaction that has not been confirmed yet, it occurred 7 hours hours ago while I was asleep. So it's being sent to an address, that I checked on block chain and it has not done any prior transactions,the transaction is still unconfirmed, and has a rate of 3sat/byte , that's all really, so can't think of a way I would have done it because I'm not selling, and mycelium has a pin , also I could not have typed an address
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:47:41
Nope Iv had it hidden , 
I keep telling myself maybe I slept on my phone which led to that, but no way I could have put that pin, 
Any ideas on how to stop the transaction? 
And I just changed my pin 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:25:54
Haha this cracked me up, but yes , Uncle Sam has power backing it up while Satoshi has...well, us. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:31:15
Basically 2 addresses it sent to 
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:30:50
There are actually 2 addresses, 13A5byuwHUL4VPTSvQE9SHTCMcqdCkCZSz this is the other , and this is in my transaction list as well 
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:54:44
Can you? How?????! 
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:47:19
So I just opened it on electrum but I do not see any transaction taking place , when I check out the counselor it shows the amounts being sent out (the ones I did not send out) to two addresses, should I send everything to my other mycelium account? Will this double spend? 
Thanks alot man! 
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:19:48
Thanks alot man! I'll be doing this today, and update you, also what segwit2 wallets are good? I think I'll open another hd account on mycelium since I'm used to the site and apparently this doesn't happen often? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:05:22
How do I double spend exactly? Do I have to send it to another account?
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:20:27
It's 3sat/byte, guessing that's really low then meaning I should just wait? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:02:51
Yeah wasn't sure which one to send you as there were two output addresses, 
Yup that's not in the list , what does this mean? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:47:05
Another redditor told me that it's because mycelium is an HD wallet and that it does that at times even though I'll get my funds back?
Also what other wallet is as good as mycelium? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:09:21
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:56:20
I have two output addresses I checked them out they have no transactions no anything 
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:13:37
There was one transaction which used the same low fees as well to see if it would go through, it didn't. 
So  this might be the same thing? And what if it isnt? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:28:59
150$ not alot for some, but alot for me haha, yeah was gonna input some funds in it, but I think I'll hold back for now and just see how this plays out, cause its very confusing, if I did get hacked and someone did try to withdraw funds, why choose the lowest mining fees? Why take half and not all of it etc 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:43:20
Where would one store litecoin?
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:06:00
And it doesn't show on the block chain, 
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:22:29
That sounds promising! And any idea on how this could have happened? I have a pin for my wallet, and I have my phrase hidden somewhere, so how? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:49:07
But Bitcoin has been growing at the same right if not faster, it's just this past week it's been kinda stagnant after it's shoots , and what do you think about selling Bitcoin for other cryptos? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:54:24
Nope no new apps , and I'm not sure what rooted phone refers to exactly ( even though I googled it) but I don't think so 
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:56:10
I don't want to send it anymore I just want to keep it, thing is mycelium keeps re sending I think, so if I wait two weeks my balance would go back to normal then? Or is there something I ought to do for it to get back to my wallet? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:53:24
There is not option for cancellation, but there for deleting transaction, and I think that's just on my Transaction list, since I'm not actually stopping the transaction 
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:09:50
Ok ok I'll look into that , thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:44:21
Any idea what it means if my transaction is not on the block chain? Or does it take a confirmation for it to be on the block chain?
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:25:49
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:27:41
Well any suggestions on which cryptos? And also exchange sites like changelly etc? As I'd buy other cryptos using Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-11 08:44:25
I have been in the game since since 2013/14 , never let go jack 
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:32:47
What about if I'm just holding?
@_date: 2017-11-04 11:50:41
So should divide the investment? Ripple isn't doing that well though is it?
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:12:48
I bought when it went down by 5-8 percent, but it kept going down so was tempted but did not go for it, just going to hold . For eternity.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:14:00
Wait, what's exactly is going well n again? -_-"
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:56:18
What about trading crypto fees?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:22:09
The more Bitcoin becomes valuable/Stronger, the more Bitcoin there is to spread around, 
Bitcoin is not a bubble, the Fiat currencies are 
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:04:42
Is it just for Bitcoin or? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:50:14
So what happens exactly anyway, not the ledgers being divided and all but like, what exactly is a hard fork, and I see people talking about getting another kind of crypto from it for free or something?
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:04:58
Ayt ayt thanks alot for the info man! 
@_date: 2017-04-25 13:11:16
Im a kenyan, in malaysia and I have a Malaysian bank acc (maybank /alliance)
@_date: 2017-04-25 13:39:06
Ayt thanks 
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:08:38
Whats a fiat? Kept seeing it. As you can tell im new to this, and how does one get confirmation?  
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:54:02
Oh okay okay, so I guess I was kind of lucky this guy actually was honest then? Thanks for the advice man!  
@_date: 2017-04-25 12:18:47
So I am a foreigner in malaysia   can luno still work that way? As I use a Malaysian card and it needs Malaysian verification ( gotta be Malaysian?)
@_date: 2017-04-26 01:39:40
I guess il just have to do it through lbt, I dont think I jave another choice. Thing is I did not habe the minimum amount aswell for lbt, thus the unorthodox transaction,  any other suggestions?  I tried using luno, it looked promising but I need to be a citizen of the banks origin which im not 
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:58:09
Yeah I was worried that would happen,  but I guess im jiswt lucky that this transaction worked right? I sent him btc and I got the funds through my bank acc 
@_date: 2017-04-25 11:58:54
Does it work with malaysia? Maybank?
@_date: 2017-04-25 13:39:00
Shit -_-
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:01:01
Yeah but he already sent me the money to my bank account, as in i have the money now, so the transaction worked?  
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:50:15
I already sent it through my wallet, he actually sent the funds to my bank! And done witj the transaction now!  
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:23:45
Whats the escrow?  I just sent it,  I still habe his whatsap number which im communicating with 
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:09:40
So its my option if I release bitcoins or not? The buyer in this case is communicating with me through whatsapp and has given me his address to send the Btcs, , 
@_date: 2017-04-25 11:59:15
I did its quiet a mess lol
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:02:31
Yeah haha I realised after I had sent it, thats when redditors started commenting �� 
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:43:29
What if you get the same initial amount but at 5 dollars, and use that to get the altcoin? Wouldn't that mean you spent the Bitcoin without a loss? And hold the one you got at 10$ and wait for it to recover? 
Hope that made sense somehow
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:44:33
You don't tell me what to do!!!! 
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:17:37
I see it. I want it. Immortality .
@_date: 2018-03-01 06:16:23
I'm sure the article means majority countries in Africa and not just a specific country.
They literally say continent in the article.
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:12:54
It's wrong to say "or" to show difference ? 
@_date: 2018-02-17 07:09:59
I bought Bitcoin at peak, and during the dump.
Hodl forever.
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:44:06
Any negatives of using lbt? 
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:28:18
This definitely helps with organization! At least now I know how to track profit and loss , which is used more by organizations though? Any benefits of using the other? 
@_date: 2018-02-17 09:05:35
Yeah but usually they'd sell at a way higher margin , so I'm curious to why there are some selling for less at the moment? 
@_date: 2018-02-15 13:40:52
Well humans just might start living longer with artificial body parts for that 1% :/
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:36:20
Okay, well at least tell me if I'm getting this wrong or not? 
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:28:32
My first rabbit I keep, since I got it at 10$ , I'd like the value to go back up to meet my purchased amount.
Second would be to use the 5dollar rabbit to get the 2 chickens instead of using the 10$ rabbit to get 2 chickens. So if I get a 5$ Rabbit and get 2 chickens well and good. I'll still have a -5 , which is why I keep the other rabbit until the price goes up instead so I cover my loss? 
If I chose to use the 1 rabbit I got at 10$ , I'd make a loss of 5$ and that's permanent as I won't be able to cover it since I do not have the asset anymore.
@_date: 2017-10-25 04:57:59
That's basically what I'm thinking, torn between getting it now or hoping for a crash, it's quiet pricey as well which basically would mean a higher risk for me to lose more , sigh 
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:16:54
Investing every month with what you're okay to lose in the long run turns  to be an aggregate amount that you'd lose yourself if you lost it instead.
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:44:10
Okay not a hardware wallet as its kinda pricey and I wont hold alot of crypto currency in it, 
Any suggestions on other wallets? What about luno or exodus? 
Im in Asia so some sites like coinbase dont work as an exchange,  thanks for the answers so far guys! 
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:08:12
So who's sending me Abit of Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:06:16
You buy 1 rabbit for 10$ , now Rabbits are worth 5$, you can get 2 chickens for 1 rabbit, do you sell the same rabbit? Or do you buy another rabbit for 5dollars and use the one you bought at 5$ and wait for the rabbit you bought at 10$ to go up so you can buy 4 chickens? 
( Rabbits and chickens are my jam)
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:21:47
Bitcoins hodl or go home-less
@_date: 2017-09-05 01:44:34
How do I buy 10$ worth??? 
@_date: 2018-02-25 20:20:33
Ohhh, yeah makes sense ��
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:35:39
No no, the logic I'm using is still significant, it's the ratio of Bitcoin to dollars we are talking about, so it stays the same. If it was cheaper I would get more bitcoins, now at the state it's in I'd get less bitcoins, if Bitcoin prices went down after I made a purchase worth 100$ I would still lose to the same ratio as buying 6000$ to one Bitcoin, and losing it. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 08:26:34
To buy cryptos , I'm just not sure if I'll be able to use my card for it though , 
@_date: 2017-10-25 04:47:57
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:26:51
Quiet pricey meaning I have a limited amount of funds and the price it's at is already a deal breaker for me. And it's increased to an amount which can be staggering for me once it decreases as there's alot it can decrease by ( 6000$ there's alot to lose in comparison to 1000$ which you can just lose 1000$ as the maximum loss, unless you got a loan that is) 
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:11:38
Question, with total account value, that's what I have and what's it's worth now ? Right? 
Thanks again ! 
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:09:23
I think if it drops by 1500-2000$ I'll probably get some, and see where it takes me! 
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:33:46
No need to be an ass about it.
It's a constructive debate.
You get an asset A that's 10$, 
Value goes down by 5$.
You get asset B for 5 $.
Total $ used 15$, total loss 5$.
You use asset B to pay off certain expenses worth 5$.
Now you just have asset A with value of 5$ which still means you have a loss of 5$. 
You wait for the value to increase so you can get back to the initial purchased value . So you cover the loss. 
It doesn't matter which asset you sell, because at that point it's both worth the same, but keeping one of the assets is advisable as there's a chance for the value to raise again. If both assets are sold/used , the loss can not be covered .
Yes there are many factors, but this would be the basics.
Lastly, and again, no need to be an ass.
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:17:03
Of course, it's just me hoping 
@_date: 2017-10-25 04:51:52
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:02:32
Yo, just used it, it's great haha! 
Thanks alot! 
Now I know Im in a loss ;( 
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:23:01
Watch out for the drastic drop.
