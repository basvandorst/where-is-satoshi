I like slush.  I welcome your hash power!  I may have answered which I use, but I don't have any rational for it.  It's what I started with and it works.

Come back or message me when you figure this out.

I don't see an answer though.  What are you suggesting he do?
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:39:10
Damn.  Is overstock like amazon where Joe Main Street can sell stuff like on amazon?

How about you try 4 on 6 pools, or 6 on 4 pools or 12 on 2 pools until you are convinced. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:20:37
Wowz.  I'd like to see that.

Hear me out.  Go to eBay and type bitcoin miner.  See those prices.  Understand that you can buy direct, but your are competing with the large purchasing volume of the eBay resellers.  Either way you'll see how much it costs.
As far as the mining goes, I think it's great.  In fact it's the only reason I had any btc to get on an exchange with.
The argument against mining is based on your cost per kw/h.  If your cost is more than 0.06 per kw/h, you won't compete with china because they are government sponsored and get electricity for free.  
Mining supports the block chain. If you mine, you are crypto currency.  I've spent more money on dumber things.  I think it's worth it for my 0.07 kw/h.  It's so close the threshold that it's worth it to me.

Enough to buy more miners.

I played with this about 2.5 years ago.  Rewired my desk in the basement and didn't bother setting it back up until it was in the news. My ass is sore now from kicking myself.

Are you talking about "reddit.comor somewhere else?  Because I don't know if my hardware is faulty, or I something configured wrong.    My miners stay idle.  But one was working yesterday.  Tried to get second up. 
 Ugh.  I had this working before.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:26:05
So I'd I want to put my lotto money $3 a week towards bitcoin, what do I do?
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:45:11
If you sent them to a hardware wallet, wouldn't that reduce the circulating supply?
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:10:20
Wait.  Buy your own hardware wallet, figure that out, then get her one loaded with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:47:36
I think the numbers get really high when you add all the currencies.  I did a quick google and the consensus is that there are 180 national currencies world wide.  Very few are near or on par with USD 1:1
So imagine what happens when the exchange rates are taken out of the equation.  It's so exciting to think that field will be leveled and world wide a person could be exchange work for money.
Also, all the dark money stashed in Caribbean accounts, repatriated taxes.  
Honestly though, it seems too fantastic to be anything but a fantasy.
The number of the beast is a 256bit encrypted hash.

Anyone have a primer to read about this?  If I don't have a paper or hardware wallet can I get one before the fork?  Why should I?  How do I benefit from a fork?
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:18:20
I like this graph.  
You left out some notables like VR's tough slog
Digital picture frames
And perhaps dvr.  It's great, but I can't hook up my own and record endlessly. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:19:45
All of the hardware wallets do? Or just the ledger?

What are you reading that makes you concerned about this?
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:42:19
who are they? gemini or coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:18:24
Word.  Read more. Do it when you are comfortable.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:45:19
That is cute as shit!  Would love to see the top 10 coins on coinmarketcap.  Maybe top 7 for some roygbiv
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:24:52
I wondered this too.  The miners list price from 2 - 3 years ago is quite close to what they are charging now.  At least as best as I remember. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:29:47
A book about bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:18:37
So the number of the beast is 256bit hash instead of 666?

I saw this guy on cnbc last night.  I'd have to watch it again, but I don't recall him saying it was a million's worth.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:30:55
I had a broken miner; bought a broken miner.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:55:01
I thought it was fair. What happened?

Litecoin!  
Why aren't you like your cousin bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:35:08
How much is that in bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:33:40
Exactly what I have been wondering.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:06:37
There are at least 3 people in North Dakota that know about it.  I suspect 10 at the most.

New to bitcoin. Saw this last night but didn't get a chance to read about it.  Interesting to know that some Charities take Bitcoin.  
What else don't I know about bitcoin?

When all the bitcoins are mined, what is the mining equipment doing?  Someone tried to explain it to me as they verify each coin/ transaction?
