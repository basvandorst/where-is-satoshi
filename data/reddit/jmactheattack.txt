I'm not sure why I said 'very', when I really meant upper middle class and to add to that, I should of said 'annual household income'. Anyways, I guess my views of what the average income levels are were skewed -

Let's say I make an average of annual salary of $100,000 (a very middle-class salary) throughout my whole working life of around 40 years if I retire at the age of 60. I will only of made $4 million. With something like $6 million, I could buy an average house (probably less than $200,000) and live the rest of my years without having to sign a timecard. This assumes I continue to live an moderatly average life and don't start collecting expensive watches and Corvettes with the new found wealth.
"Fuck-you Money" = I can live life averagely without a day job, not I can travel in my private jet from country to country, bang'n bitches without jimmies.

I'm pretty sure that the domain was used for spam and malware in the recent past when they supposedly "came back".
A site like that really shouldn't need a large amount of startup capital considering how successful they were and that they did have advertising and a method of donating. I wouldn't be surprised if it was a scam by whoever is currently controlling the domain.
