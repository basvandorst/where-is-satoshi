Thanks for posting my article. I've noticed that Reddit comments are highly variable. Sometimes I get very insightful comments, and sometimes not so much...
In any case, implementing the SHA-256 algorithm helped me understand why Bitcoin mining hardware works so well. The steps of the hash are simple bit manipulation and addition, so I can almost imagine the logic circuitry you'd put on a chip, and how you could make it parallel. Something like elliptic curve signing, on the other hand, is just a mess. I wouldn't want to even write code to implement that, let alone think about how to do it in hardware.
Back to the Apollo Guidance Computer, we've run some of the original moon landing software on the AGC. (The code is on [github]( It makes the moon landing pretty real when you can go through a simulated landing with the actual code on the actual computer.

Thanks for the shoutout! As for it not looking like you expected, Unicode defines the characters but not their appearance. So if Apple uses a sans-serif Bitcoin symbol, nothing is stopping them. Of course, after a couple years people will assume that Apple's rendering of the character is the "right" one and the original is the weird one.

I'm not sure what you mean by special characters and invalid addresses. The address corresponds to the 160-bit public key hash, which can be any 160-bit value. This is the value that gets encoded into the transaction, not the ASCII address. This 160-bit value is encoded using base 58 check encoding to form the ASCII string that people use as an address.
For example, 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE is a valid encoded address. Obviously nobody has the private key associated with it, so the 1.98 BTC there are lost forever. 1J2KY@ on the other hand is not a valid encoded address, and cannot be decoded to a 160-bit address so it can't even be inserted into a transaction. It's not that miners reject it, it's meaningless to try to use it in a transaction. Likewise, an address that fails checksum can't be decoded to a 160-bit address, so it's meaningless to use it. (Note that miners don't even see the checksum, since they only see the 160-bit address hash.)
Hopefully this clears things up, rather than confusing things. (I'm ignoring bad scripts.) I've written a bunch about addresses in [Bitcoins the hard way]( if you want to know more.

If you send bitcoins to the address above (which nobody has yet), the transaction is recorded in the blockchain. The address is stored in the blockchain as a "Hash 160" in hex. For example, 1849mW... is stored in the blockchain as 20 hex bytes 4d6172... However, the byte 4d is 'M' in ASCII. The byte 61 is 'a' in ASCII, 72 is 'r', and so on. So if you look in the blockchain for ASCII strings (bitcoinstrings.com is the easy way), you would see the hidden text message.
Maybe I should write an article about this :-)
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:17:49
Suppose the entire Bitcoin hash rate were used to try to find a private key matching a 160-bit public key hash. 2^160 / 27000 TH/sec = 5.4e+31 seconds, or 1.7x10^24 years. The universe is only 14 billion years old. So it would only take you 100 trillion ages-of-the-universe to find the private key by brute force. You'd be better off funding some mathematicians and hope they find a solution.
(In addition, the private/public keys use elliptic curves so the mining hardware would not even work.)
If you want to understand exactly how the public key / private key setup in Bitcoin transactions works, I've written a detailed article:

It's 100 confirmations for coinbase transactions (i.e. new coins). I assume this is because if these coins were spent and then the transaction that created the coins became orphaned, it would cause chaos, since all the downstream transactions with these coins would become invalid too. 100 confirmations seems like a long time, but since there was an 8-hour (53 block) fork before, waiting for 100 confirmations isn't unreasonable. (
I was looking at the recently, so I can provide a link to the code responsible for the 100 confirmation requirement:

That's a very good question. There's not much physical exertion, so assuming a resting metabolic rate of 1500kcal/day, it works out to almost 10 megajoules / hash. A typical energy consumption for mining hardware is 1000 megahashes / joule. So I'm less energy efficient by a factor of 10^16, or 10 quadrillion.
The next question is the cost. A cheap source of food energy is [donuts]( at $.23 for 200 kcalories. Electricity here is $.15/kilowatt-hour, which is cheaper by a factor of 6.7 - closer than I expected. Thus my energy cost per hash is about 67 quadrillion times that of mining hardware. It's clear I'm not going to make my fortune off mining, and I haven't even included the cost of all the paper and pencils I'll need.

Finding the images is basically a treasure hunt. I look through the blockchain for things that look like they might be images. Strings ending in '.jpg' are a big clue. Or strings such as JFIF that appear inside jpg images.
Once I've found a potential location, I either parse the transactions myself with a Python script or pull up the raw data in blockchain.info or blockexplorer.com. Then I need to extract the image file from the raw data. People use a variety of ways of encoding the data, which makes it tricky. For example, the logo image was in the Usenet yEnc encoding. Hopefully the result of this process is a viewable image.
TL;DR: look at a whole lot of hex data until you find an image

There's not much you need to know to do the SHA-256 hashing that Bitcoin uses for mining: convert between binary and hex, add hex numbers, and do simple operations on bits (are there more 0's or 1's? is the number of 1's odd or even?). If you haven't studied hex and binary, it may sound scary but you could probably learn in 10 minutes.
On the other hand, the elliptic curve cryptography used to sign transactions is much harder - you need to do a bunch of modular multiplications and divisions on 32-byte integers. And if you try to understand the math, you rapidly end up in college-level math with Abelian groups and finite fields, and then it gets even more difficult. I've written a high-level explanation of Bitcoin's elliptic curves [here]( that might help.

You need to use the constants the NSA defined for SHA-256 or else it's not SHA-256. But the constants are just simple math values, not anything the NSA could have tweaked to put in a back door. Specifically, the initial hash values come from the square roots of the first 8 primes, and the Kt values come from the cube roots of the first 64 primes. In other words, they needed to define some values for the algorithm, so rather than saying "trust us and use these special values", they picked values that anyone could reproduce.

Is the malleability attack still happening? I tried 15 transactions and was disappointed to not see any malleability (10pm PST 2/11) So does anyone know if the attack has stopped?
@_date: 2014-02-28 08:26:32
There are a bunch of different types of malleability. I looked at the OP_PUSHDATA2 malleability, which was the recent DOS attack. Notably this attack was after MtGox's announcement of malleability issues.
Your plan is to look for non-standard input signatures, but I don't think that will work since only the standard signatures end up in the blockchain. There are a lot of reports of MtGox generating badly-signed transactions, which after bitcoin 0.8.0 (released Feb 19 2013) resulted in transactions that couldn't be confirmed. It is widely claimed (although I couldn't find conclusive proof) that people would manually fix the signatures in these transactions so they could go through (i.e. malleability). This seems the most likely type of malleability to cause problems. Unfortunately, since the original transactions never got confirmed, there is no record of them in the blockchain. So I don't see any way to track this down without data from MtGox.
Although looking for non-standard signatures prior to Feb 2013 might be a good way to find potential MtGox addresses. (They wouldn't all be MtGox, and not all MtGox addresses would be there, but it would be a start. I've read that Armory also generated bad signatures and I'm sure there are others.)
There are several other types of malleability, but I don't know if they are relevant or not: 
The analysis would be a lot easier if MtGox gave more information about their malleability problems, but I guess that won't happen.
If I have time, I want to look for all pairs of transactions for the same amount to the same address. This would give an upper bound on what could have been stolen by malleability. But there may be too many false positives for this to be useful.
In any case, good luck with your analysis.

Author here: thanks for pointing that Python random isn't secure - I've added a note to the code. My code is purely for illustration, though; I strongly recommend using a real Bitcoin library if one wants to do something for real.
The math behind the invalid private keys is interesting. The elliptic curve arithmetic is done modulo a prime; Bitcoin uses a prime just below 2^256: the prime is 2^256 - 2^32 - 2^9 -2^8 - 2^7 - 2^6 - 2^4 - 1, so values between this and 2^256 are not valid. As Gavin pointed out in a comment (I wasn't expecting the Bitcoin chief scientist to show up here), the odds of hitting one of these values is essentially zero. Out of curiosity, I just tested the Python ecdsa library, and it throws an exception if you try to use a bad key.

Storing 4 bits per character would save memory, but with (exactly) 16,000 characters of memory in the IBM 1401, it's not a problem to waste 256 characters. The problem with using packed bits is that you can't do any bit operations on the character, so you'd need to tediously pull the bits out of the character (by subtraction or lookup tables), do your operations, and then put the bits back into the character (with addition). That would make the hash much slower, and with Bitcoin mining, slower is costing you money!
@_date: 2015-05-24 00:59:14
One interesting thing about that photo is it shows the enormous cables that connect the IBM 1401 to the printer and card reader. Normally you can't see those cables because they go under the false floor. Some of the cables are power cables - the AC power is actually connected to the card reader, which contains power supplies that feed multiple voltages to the IBM 1401 computer itself. Other cables are thick because everything is parallel: for the 132-column printer, there are 132 wires from the IBM 1401 to the printer. And for the 80-column card reader there are 80 wires from the card reader to the IBM 1401 (and 80 more wires for the card punch, and 80 more wires for the second reading station...) We have it so easy now with USB cables.

Using table lookups for the operations is a good idea. I should implement that and the profits will just roll in. (The sigma boxes would be tricky, though, because they require bit shifts so you'd need to pull the bits apart for them.)

I recently got a symbol approved for Unicode, so I can provide some information on what needs to be done to get the Bitcoin symbol added and how to write a Unicode proposal.
The key thing the Unicode committee looks for is examples of use of the symbol in running text, i.e. not as a standalone logo or symbol, but in sentences. If you want them to approve the Bitcoin symbol, you first need to git it used on websites, books, etc. This seems like a chicken-and-egg problem, but the solution is to use inline images, webfonts, etc. Once the symbol is in use, it will be much easier to demonstrate to the Unicode committee that they should add it.
The Bitcoin community seems to be going about the process backwards: first picking a symbol, next trying to get Unicode to accept it, and finally using the Unicode character. That's not going to work.

If you want to check that your system works correctly, there's a block and hash shown [here]( Does your system let you start with the block on the left (0200...48750833) and end up with the hash on the right (0000...2a50)?

Well, it depends. The [official Unicode view]( on combining characters is:
Often a proposed character can be expressed as a sequence of one or more existing Unicode characters. Encoding the proposed character would be a duplicate representation, and is thus not suitable for encoding. (In any event, the proposed character would disappear when normalized.) For example, a g-umlaut character is not suitable for encoding, since it can already be expressed with the sequence &lt;g, combining diaeresis&gt;.

@_date: 2015-08-31 15:28:06

I would argue that the Bitcoin symbol is somewhat similar to B with combining lines on top, but is different enough visually that it should be a separate symbol in Unicode. (I.e. the line doesn't go through the B.)  It is also not semantically a B with lines on top in the sense that ü is a u with an umlaut on top.

Mining-with-pencil-and-paper guy here. Generating the public key from the private key by hand would be pretty tedious, but possible. You'd need to do a bunch of multiplications of 256-bit numbers and 256-bit modulo operations for the elliptic curve signature. If you then want to convert the public key to the 160-bit public key hash by hand, you'd need to do SHA-256 (same as mining) and RIPEMD-160. RIPEMD-160 looks like 80 cycles of simple bit operations, so it wouldn't be too bad. After that, the base-58 encoding to an address string would be trivial.
So, I think manual generation of a public key by hand would be painful, but possible if you had a whole lot of time, for instance if you were stuck in a Japanese prison...

It's not totally clear what you're asking, due to language issues and also due to legal vs "normal" meanings, but I think your question is if you can print out a bitcoin (somehow) and then use that as a security, something that has value, kind of like a dollar bill.
The answer is no, and I suspect the papers you read are wrong (or are using a different meaning). If you print a bitcoin (presumably that means printing the private key), the paper does have the value of the bitcoin. The problem is that you or someone else with the key can spend the bitcoin, making the "printed bitcoin" suddenly worthless.
As an analogy, suppose I have $100 in the bank and give you a check for $100. The check is worth $100 right now, but if I take the money out of the bank before you cash the check, the check is worthless. So the check is not useful as a security or collateral, unlike $100 cash. Printing a bitcoin is like the check, not the cash.
I guess you could set up some contrived situation where you transfer the bitcoin to an address and print the private key without looking and seal it in an envelope and lock it in a safety deposit box. Then the "printed bitcoin" would be securitized and whoever has the key to the safety deposit box can count on getting the bitcoin if they want to.
(Not a criticism but a language tip: you're looking for a "reliable source"; "liable" means "legally responsible".)

I don't know anything more about AsicBoost beyond a few minutes of reading, but...
First, according to asicboost.com, AsicBoost is patent pending. This is totally different from patented. "Patent pending" means they have filed for a patent, but until it is issued (which can take years), they have approximately zero rights. Various people in this thread say AsicBoost is patented, but it is totally wrong to say AsicBoost is patented until a patent has been granted.
As far as reverse engineering an ASIC, that's way beyond my chip reverse engineering skills and would be very difficult. The [AsicBoost paper]( says that AsicBoost improves performance up to 20% by reducing gate count, so you could probably guess that AsicBoost is in place by noticing the die area is 20% smaller than you'd expect, rather than fully reverse-engineering the circuit.
Since AsicBoost requires a lot of work off the ASIC to produce colliding block header candidates, it would be a lot easier to detect AsicBoost by looking at what is passed to the ASIC, rather than looking at the ASIC itself. This would require some reverse-engineering of the protocols to the ASIC, but that wouldn't be too hard.
If Bitmain's ASIC uses AsicBoost, that would more likely be bad for AsicBoost than for Bitmain, as it would probably count as prior art. This should prevent a patent on AsicBoost, but I wouldn't be surprised by anything the patent office does. Bitmain could sue to get an AsicBoost patent invalidated, but this would hinge on obscure details of the exact claims in the AsicBoost patent.
Disclaimers: I'm jumping into the middle of this discussion without knowing who the players are and what the backstory is; my comments are based on skimming the AsicBoost paper. I'm not a lawyer and patents are very complicated. (I do have 20 patents of my own though.)

It would be better to have the Bitcoin character in the normal Unicode range and not the SMP range because some systems have broken SMP support.

I'd like to submit the proposal in the next couple of weeks if possible, but I can wait. The Unicode Committee has their next meeting Nov 2. and they'll need the proposal at least a couple weeks before that.

Thanks for the corrections. I've created rev 5. The "collation sequence" means how to sort the symbol if it appears in a string. E.g. you could sort the symbol between "B" and "C", but that's a bad idea. The collation order matters if you have an alphabet or numbers, but it's not relevant for the Bitcoin symbol.

Awesome! I wasn't expecting this until June, when the Bitcoin symbol will hopefully become part of Unicode 10. It's a long process to get stuff officially into Unicode. It looks like Apple decided to add the symbol to Sierra early, so yay for Apple. (I'm the author of the [Bitcoin Unicode proposal]( so AMA.)

Usernames are okay, although real names look more real :-)

I've added borders, cleaned up the fonts a bit, and applied Bob's suggestions. The examples are in a variety of fonts because that's what the examples used. You can take a look at the updated document.

I couldn't find anything recent about the Bitcoin Foundation's effort on a Unicode symbol, and they didn't respond to email, so the project seems abandoned.
In any case, will the Bitcoin Foundation endorse my proposal?

Proposal author here. I'm planning to submit this to the Unicode committee in a couple weeks.  The earlier discussion is [here]( - thanks to everyone who gave me helpful feedback. Let me know if you represent a Bitcoin company, user group, etc and want to be added to the proposal as a supporter.

Cool! I downloaded and installed the font, set the browser font to "droid sans", and it actually worked! [Screenshot]( (Edited to take luke-jr's advice.)

I'm told that Apple included the Bitcoin symbol in the recent iOS 10 update as well as in macOS Sierra. 
And thank you for explaining the ASCII cat picture; I was mystified why it was on the frontpage. But if you include ₿, it's no longer ASCII :-)
@_date: 2015-09-04 15:06:30
Thanks; I appreciate your support. "Endorsed by busterroni" probably won't sway the Unicode committee much, though :-)

In case anyone is curious about the details of that computer, it's a Elliott 405 being installed in Norwich in 1957 as [Britain's first municipal computer]( for tasks such as water rate billing.
The computer uses 32-bit words and has a 4096 word rotating drum memory. The "high-speed" memory is 320 words of nickel wire delay line, unreliable and called a "triumph of hope over science". Mass storage was magnetic tape, which they call "magnetic film" for some British reason. Tape was very slow - 300 characters per second.
The computer uses [16-bit instructions]( including multiply/divide. An add instruction took [306 microseconds]( which is pretty slow: about 3000 instructions per second. Because of the delay line storage, you might need to wait for your data to become available, so instructions could take multiple milliseconds. (Kind of like a cache miss today.)
The picture is just a part of the computer, maybe the console. The computer consisted of 9 cabinets, each weighing [320 pounds]( and roughly the size of a narrow refrigerator: 6'6" by 2' by 2'. It contains 3000 vacuum tubes. A large installation could have up to 82 cabinets.
The computer has a mean time to failure of 12 hours.
The computer was powered by a 25kVA motor-generator, i.e. the AC line drives a 33 HP motor, which is connected to a generator that outputs 415V, 3 phase power. This goes to a three-cabinet power unit which creates the voltages the computer needs.
The Elliott 405 predates good industrial styling - it looks like something you'd find in a Soviet power plant.
More info [here]( and detailed architecture [here](
All in all, this computer with vacuum tubes and delay lines is much more primitive than the IBM 1401 which came out two years later, with magnetic core memory and all-transistor technology. Of course I may be biased since [I programmed the IBM 1401 to mine Bitcoin](
As far as Bitcoin scalability, the entire Bitcoin transaction volume could be handled by a single Raspberry Pi running a SQL database.

No, because bitcoins can move around. Only a few million people could hold a whole BTC at one time, but if they are getting spent, everyone on earth could possess one at some point.

The Bitcoin symbol was added to macOS Sierra, so your machine wouldn't have it. But the behavior you see is strange.

"A capital letter B with two vertical lines 'going through' it, though the lines are only visible at the top and bottom." Similar to the baht but different: two bars instead of one and the bars aren't visible inside the loops of the B. [Image](

Why? Those bitcoins aren't going to mine themselves...
The serious answer is that I like doing anachronistic things on old computers. I wanted to program something on the Alto that people would find interesting. Bitcoin mining is both easy (but not trivial) to program and something topical. Any other suggestions for things that would be nice to see on the Alto?

Author of the Nelson Mandela article here. Usually people complain that my articles have too much detail, rather than too little... But the most common technique is just what itisike says. You start with your data as a bunch of bytes (ASCII, jpeg, or whatever). You break it into 20-byte chunks. You format each chunk as an address. Finally, you send a tiny amount to each address. The amount you send is lost forever since these are fake addresses. (I.e. addresses without a private key.) Footnote 4 of my article gives more detail.
If you want concrete steps, see the simple three-step process at the bottom of the article under the heading "How to put your own message in the blockchain".

Oh well, I guess I wasted my time making the font. But why are people still using Ƀ and ฿ instead of using the BTC symbol via a web font? Why aren't these web fonts more popular and well-known? If you want to get the BTC symbol into Unicode, the first step is for everyone to start using it in text.

The full SHA-256 algorithm is on Wikipedia [here]( This explains the padding algorithm and how the message is broken into chunks. (My blog post was already getting long, so I left out these details.)
@_date: 2018-12-04 20:50:06
The "original message" fed into SHA-256 is the version + hash + Merkle root + timestamp + bits + nonce bytes concatenated together to form the Bitcoin block header; there's nothing tricky happening here.  On my web page, those are the bytes highlighted in yellow in the block diagram.
Then you apply the padding described on the SHA-256 Wikipedia page to make two chunks that get used by SHA-256. These chunks then generate the array of W words that get used in the actual rounds of hashing. My article [Bitcoin mining the hard way]( has some Python code that may make things clearer.

I got that text alert that my 2FA settings had changed so I contacted Coinbase support. They quickly replied:


Then I received the same email as that my settings had not been changed. I don't know what to make of the contradictory messages, but it seems an internal error rather than a scam attempt.
(I searched reddit to see if anyone else had encountered this, which is how I found this discussion.)

I'm not entirely sure of that syntax, but that looks right. Shift all the bits to the right three, adding three zeros on the left.
@_date: 2017-06-21 16:37:01
The Unicode value for the Bitcoin sign ₿ is U+20bf, which is decimal 8383. If I understand Microsoft's documentation, typing 20bf Alt-X or maybe 8383 Alt-X might work. (Let me know if it does.) Cut-and-paste is probably easier.
@_date: 2018-12-06 21:47:32
My experience is that it's super-frustrating to get this to work, since if you get the smallest thing wrong, everything turns to garbage. My recommendation is before you try this on your own, write a program that uses a library to do the sha-256. (I used hashlib.sha256 in Python.) First make sure that you get the right results from that, and you'll know that you have the right inputs. Then add a bunch of debugging statements to the library to print important information along the way (like the values after each round), and make sure everything matches up. (It doesn't help that Bitcoin keeps switching the byte order of things.)
It looks like you have the right input. Keep in mind that Bitcoin does SHA-256 twice. After the first SHA-256 on the above data, you should get 7c122b86287a3ef7eac247e0ad637091ccfecbf85f6213030d9c1f895515d9e6. Doing SHA-256 to that value is what gives you the successful hash ending in zeros: 502a989242bdfa912da58a972836c9cdfedd4a0278a467e00000000000000000. So I want to make sure we're both talking about the same hash stage.
