If you live in Japan it usually takes around 1-2 days after requesting a withdrawal. If you use our fast withdrawal service it only takes around 3 mins after requesting a withdrawal. Currently, we only support Japanese banks, but we are planning to support different countries.

Yes! We are experiencing transaction confirmation issue in past few days. As bitcoin exchange service we believe block size limit should be raised. From customers standpoint, there should be no delays in transactions. We hope this problem will solve soon to provide the best possible service to our users.

We put our best effort to make our service easy to use. With coincheck, anyone can own bitcoin wallet and start buying bitcoins within few taps.  As a pioneer, we believe making user-friendly service is essential to attract the majority of the general public.

At this point, we don't feel scalability issue. 
Even if 30% of Japanese e-commerce use our bitcoin payment service,
we believe total transactions will not eat up overall capacity. 
There are not many bitcoin users in Japan still compared to the world.
However, in the long term scalability of bitcoin may restrict our business. We hope bitcoin scalability issue will be resolved by that time.
