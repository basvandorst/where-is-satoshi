I thought CGT only applies when you sell the coins at a profit?

Fair enough, if I was paid in BTC I'd prefer to spend in BTC too.
@_date: 2014-12-26 01:56:07
Thanks man
@_date: 2014-04-14 18:47:28
Honest question: why do you use BTC to buy from major retailers?  Why not just use a credit card instead?
As someone with a very small holding in BTC, I'd prefer to keep it rather than spend it and then have to go through the hassle of buying more just to go and spend it again.  Just curious why you and others are prefer to spend it, particularly in places when a credit card would work fine?

What you're doing is good, and I appreciate it.  But:


Doesn't that make everything more expensive than it would otherwise be with the transaction fees involved in getting dollars into an exchange, buying BTC, and then withdrawing?

I mean when you live outside the US and order from Amazon.com to your country (not all items ship internationally), the delivery is cheaper than on competing sites, such as overstock.
@_date: 2014-03-11 16:55:15


With what?  Your email address and password?  If your mtgox password is unique, then no problem?
@_date: 2014-08-25 14:40:11
Amazon are a lot cheaper for international shipping than Overstock, and for import taxes they give an estimation that you are billed for, and then you are later refunded the difference between the amount collected on the border, and the original amount paid.
If Overstock did this, and had cheaper shipping, I would use them.  But they don't.
@_date: 2014-05-07 06:47:31


Not sure why anyone would downvote this.  Bitcoin *currently* has too high of a learning curve and security risk for people like your grandmother to get into.  Facebook doesn't.
We're all here because we're betting that bitcoin will evolve into something that your grandmother can use, but right now it's just not there.

It's far cheaper to use Amazon.com for international shipping.  Also they refund the difference if the import taxes on the border work out to less than you pre-paid for.

Why are your international delivery rates so high?  I can't afford to buy from you, and shop from Amazon.com instead just because your international delivery rates aren't competitive.

Forgive my ignorance, but could the network not be spammed with transactions with 0 fees attached, or the lowest possible fee, and the same problem of transaction backlog would occur, no?
Am I not correct in thinking that if you send bitcoin without a fee, it still usually gets processed?
@_date: 2015-05-21 03:03:33


Jesus, god, why, man?
@_date: 2015-05-31 03:10:56
So miners can choose what to confirm and what not to confirm?  Is there a setting in the mining software that says "don't process transactions with a fee less than X"?  As a miner in a pool, I never saw anything like that, but I wonder if the pool owner has that control?

What does "velocity" mean in this instance?  I've not heard the term in association with BTC transactions.

Why?  Isn't it a pain having to calculate capital gains tax every time you make a purchase?  That's the obstacle I see.  If it didn't require CGT, I would expect it's use as a currency to increase hugely, but it does, so I can't understand why anyone would chose to use it over cash/card in a department store.
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:52:51
Changing your claim address is a non-trivial process.  Can you make it possible to do it online?  And is it even necessary to update your address in order to receive a payout?
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:18:27
AFAIK in Japan there is no CGT allowance, and bitcoin aren't even taxed as Capital Gains.  Every gainful transaction with them must be reported as miscellanous income.


The alternative option is just to use fiat.  Unless you are paid in bitcoin, why would you use anything but fiat to buy something in a department store?
