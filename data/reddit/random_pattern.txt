Aha! I was right…there *are* wallet apps using it already.
Too bad I've had very bad luck with Electrum and Armory so far. Armory crashed and wouldn't work at all after I set it up; Electrum's design and various terminology for the different parts of BTC taxonomy drives me nuts.

This is the most out-of-the-box thing I've read in days of watching reddit coin subs.
Of course it will never happen. The U.S. Gov't isn't smart enough. They're only now starting to realize what an atrocious amount of money they've wasted on the drug war over the last 40 years.
@_date: 2014-02-21 18:10:18
yeah, I get it; in retrospect, my question was pretty dumb
I just had this vision of them coming to his home and pounding on the door
probably because of the outrage over that recent TOS change by Capital One (which they are now backpedaling on at the speed of light, due to the huge protests)

Yes, it's killer in the sense that it offers nearly unlimited choice of input currency and output currency.
But when it comes to cryptocurrency, I can't help but look at this and wonder: But what about the ever-fluctuating value rates caused by the market? Who is determining the rate(s)?
Because it sounds like Shapeshift is "determining" the rate, which means whether the conversion is advantageous to you or not is out of your hands.
Despite all the bad things about Coinbase, for instance, I recall that their "guarantee" was that they would affix the exchange rate "in stone" right at the moment you purchase Bitcoin with fiat (don't know if they still guarantee that or not).

This is awesome. There's a Porsche dealer there right at the southern edge near Menlo Park. Wonder if they'll part with a Boxter or Panamera for coin.

That's a given. Some rather substantial percentage of reddit is now bot accounts owned and controlled by various entities using their bot armies to influence opinion for economic, political, or other type of gain. It really wasn't like this three years ago. 
Otoh, reddit has gotten funnier. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 12:22:54
are we sure it was Gox?
could it have been Coinbase or another company?
@_date: 2014-01-06 11:33:28
Wow, great explanation. I assume this "feature" has be available "system wide." There would be no point to only 5% of people doing transactions having the availability/interest in doing it. 
So the feature has to "come" to (and be available to) all the major software wallets (as well as be "a part of the system"). Likely to happen this year?
I'm a little confused, because I thought that one wallet software I experimented with had this—but I can't remember which.
@_date: 2014-02-21 17:57:56
In person? What? Where?
@_date: 2014-01-13 12:04:23
I wrote to the company that makes iBank a week ago about this. They were pretty much clueless about what Bitcoin was. Maybe if I let them know Mint is getting on board, it will light a fire under their butt. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 15:36:12
Wow, only ten days on Reddit and you're already at Insult Level 8. Good work! I'm sure you'll fit in just fine around here.
@_date: 2014-02-04 09:37:10
Same here. What with tipping and the January price rise, quadrupled my equity in three weeks (even allowing for cost basis differential). While I was in BTC, I think I made 10% in three months. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 12:08:18
Coinbase DOES have 2FA, at least.

Two words: brain wallet. 
In case of death or amnesia: three trusted friends, each with 1/3 of the passphrase and each others' phone numbers. 
@_date: 2014-02-04 09:39:46
VERY important analogy. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 18:02:31
well, I haven't been hit so far
doesn't mean I love Chase—I don't—but my accounts are still ok
I have a business and two personal accounts
I've made 3 transfers from my personal checking to coinbase, each under $100
I'm unemployed for quite a while, so the grand total of all my Chase account balances is always under $1000, and usually under $100
maybe they haven't closed me down because it's so obvious that I have no money :-)
but thank you, OP, for posting…I have lived in fear (since I set up transfers with coinbase) that Chase was going to ax me at some point
and per things I'm reading in this thread, I guess there's still reason to worry
@_date: 2014-02-10 12:09:26
I remember reading that post. Your paraphrase of it is accurate.
@_date: 2014-11-17 21:17:18
yeah, well, you *are* in Portland, which I have always thought was the best city for love on the west coast
does the Hawthorne Bridge still have those wooden planks, or did they upgrade it?
@_date: 2014-03-29 22:47:01


If that's the case, there needs to be a MUCH BIGGER explanation of this - like an ELI5 topic, plus something on the AUR sub sidebar, etc.
I am very active on an exchange and most people there believe (due to the circlejerk bitcointalk thread) that AUR is "dead" due to someone gaining 51% control and hard forking the coin into 3 separate forks.
I have come to the Reddit AUR community to try to find out the real truth and am getting nowhere. 
The exchange I am on had a bunch of Icelanders join us earlier in the week and they have suddenly stopped showing up now.
I wish someone on the AUR dev team or someone who can provide credentials would explain what is really going on.
@_date: 2014-11-16 23:47:02
This is flat-out cool. Portland has this AND Powell's? Maybe it's time to move back.
@_date: 2014-12-17 10:21:22
Upvoted for making me think. Several times. Content rarely does that anymore (sadly enough). The signal-to-noise ratio has become quite abysmal in the last five years.

haha - upvote, since I figure you're probably referring to me - toché

It is SO not overpriced. But why no graphs?
@_date: 2014-01-13 12:07:25
IMHO, the only true guarantee is a brain wallet with the passphrase divided into thirds and distributed among your three best friends in case you get amnesia or die. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 12:22:08
no luck :-(

I have heard good things about VoS. Maybe this conversion is a good thing, and they will remain viable and dependable afterward.

Nothing there. Hopefully that is good.

How long have you been on computers? Tell me in number of hours. 
I'm been using them daily since about 1977 in both my professional and personal life, so I've got over 100,000 hours under my belt. I've been professionally and personally watching the market closely (and dozens of companies' progress) for decades.
I think Apple's approach to UI, just to mention one element of computers, continues to be visionary, despite the slew of screwups and lack of leadership since Steve's passing.
And I say this having been a DOS/Windows guy until 1997 (which was when I switched).
Yes, I know that (for instance) the first iPod released was NOT new technology. The [Personal Jukebox]( (hardware from Korea, software from Compac) had been out for a few years already (since 1998), and users had been upgrading their HDs even as high as 20GB.
But that doesn't change Apple's very visionary approach to a lot of things. There are too many items in their ecosystem to list them all here, but TimeMachine, iTunes Match, Target Boot mode, Firewire, gesture-based computing on both portable devices AND laptops, and extended and journaled HD formatting come to mind.
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:17:32
This is a great help! Thank you so much for your detailed and comprehensive responses.
I am particularly glad that I under stand this part correctly:


The last part that I put in italics there is a little misleading, since I think there are two working usages of the term "wallet." One is what you've used in your responses, almost a synonym for what I call each single "private key-public key-bitcoin URL address." The other regular usage I see of the word "wallet" is to describe what a "wallet" software (there are many) does: act as an organizing software for all your private/public key-BTC URL addresses, make change, "hold" your private keys "under the hood," etc. It may be important to be careful when using the word "wallet" so as to avoid confusion.
Getting this part right:


was the core of a lot of research I did in the beginning. I set up a Mac that would boot completely disconnected from the Internet from a newly reformatted external HD with a brand new install of OS X. Then I used Diceware and a completely off-line session of bitaddress.org to create an ultra secret master private key (curtains drawn, notes taken on paper on top of metal so that no impressions were made, all notes immediately hidden afterward until I can learn the long diceware passphrase that bitaddress.org can "unlock" to give me the private key; once I memorize that passphrase, I'll burn the piece of paper and scatter the ashes randomly across my Brooklyn neighborhood. Cryptography Bushwick style in da hood!).

Seems like it's been pretty uneventful since the jump to ~725 BTC-e at about 01:00 GMT.
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:08:15
You have me on hours; and I bet you're able to navigate assembly language, which I certainly am not!
Your insight and assertions about Apple's strong suit being in behind-the-scenes tech and amalgamating existing tech are more than viable. I'm going to have to rethink all this.
This is a good debate. Even though I may ultimately disagree with you in principle, I feel bad that you're getting downvoted.
Your opinions may be controversial, but they are extremely well-reasoned!
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:25:59


How? By checking Bitcoin-QT or something else that updates your coins' balances in real time?
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:02:49
Well, wait a minute… 
What if you have an offline, brainwallet-stored, private/public key pair that you NEVER use to buy anything. You just "push" equity to it through transfers from exchanges and other crypto accounts to the keypair's public address. There is then no I.P. address ever associated with that private/public keypair.
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:34:53
I don't see "Order History" anywhere on the website.
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:34:40
I posted because I had heard many times on reddit that coinbase's customer support is often very slow in responding. I never expected them to respond so fast. And to be clear, they haven't responded to subsequent questions about why I can't buy BTC (even though my bank is hooked up). So I'm still in the same boat: can't buy BTC, and no answer from coinbase as to why.
Reddit IS often awesome for fast technical help. I had another BTC-related software problem today, posted, and got a perfect response within 10 mins.
If it's against rules to post these kinds of questions, however, I am happy to go elsewhere to resolve these type of problems. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:35:35
Good point! That's the *one* exception where there's a 1-to-1 match, because people normally think of "store-the-passphrase-in-my-BRAIN" for usually just one private/public key pair/URL address…although for some wallet software, there's that "seed" concept and the passphrase unlocks the seed unlocks ALL the private/public key pair/URL address items together.
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:41:48
Hmmm…maybe Chase is rejecting my order, and that's why clicking the Confirm button doesn't do anything. Weird, since coinbase says that my Chase account is linked. Let's wait and see what coinbase says...

My dad told me (in 1996) that the Internet was "evil" and full of thieves. He stated he would never, ever get on the Internet. (He never did. He died in 2006. The most modern machine in his home was a calculator from the 60s or 70s.)
He also believed that New York City was full of thieves and murderers; he advised me that it was a very dangerous place, and that I would regret having moved there. Even though his farm was a mere four-drive from NYC, he never visited me after I moved to NYC. 
Dads can be weird.

Google meddling in my BTC biz? They're already trying to get their hands in everything else. Their search results aren't even objective anymore! (being tailor-filtered for my "convenience")
I'd dismiss anything even LOOKING like it was from them. 
Scammer, you chose the wrong foil. 
@_date: 2013-12-29 19:23:21
Wait—is this true? i.e. Noone can safely "give" you an older coin: by doing so they must destroy the old coin and create a fresh new one.
What if it was a trusted friend, and they just "merely" handed over the private key and said, "You can have this."
srintuar says "safely"—ok. But what about "unsafely"?
@_date: 2013-12-30 01:48:22
I read your post that you referenced, was more confused than ever, and so I posted a reply there.
I understand the whole "last coin" value issue better now, tho.

Totally awesome rig, OP! Makes me nostalgic for my day trading days with turnkey exchange access and instant execution.

If this is true, then I'm misunderstanding a TON of stuff about Bitcoin.
I thought transactions were/are to a specific, single, public/private keypair.
And I thought that the term "wallet" referred to something, like Bitcoin-QT, that stored numerous different Public/Private keypairs.
I also had the follow understanding: that when "sending" BTC equity from a wallet that had/has numerous public/private keypairs, the wallet software would pull from different keypairs until it had the requisite amount that you wanted to transfer to someone who had given you one of their public keys. And finally, that most softwares will create "on-the-fly" (automatically) random public/private keypairs in order to "make change" when a transfer doesn't fully deplete the BTC equity in a particular public/private keypair.
I also was under the assumption that you could use just about any wallet software to "create" (i.e., find) a brand new public/private keypair for you, and that you would thereafter "own" that public/private keypair (often referred to as a Bitcoin or BTC or Bitcoin account) and could transfer funds *into* that keypair, and later spend funds (transfer) *from* that keypair.
How wrong am I about all this stuff?
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:35:36
