You are making a mistake by disregarding the first out the door effect.  As far as tech goes yes bitcoin is behind, yes there are better offerings with more value.  But no other coin compares as far as adoption rate, recognizability, etc and that's not something you can copy.

@_date: 2019-07-12 16:03:34
Because to Donald Trump, everything is based around how much money you have.  To him "Bitcoin" is just a bunch of people in their basements buying drugs from each other; they have no value.  Facebook, on the other hand, is flush with cash; therefore they have value.  For him there is no value beyond money.  There is no such thing as social value, moral value, even just simple human value; there is only money.  As long as someone has money, regardless of how much he dislikes them, he will always side with them over someone who, in his mind, does not.

You boxed yourself in, asswipe.  Here is a short list of stances he can have publicly
-No stance.  He could literally just shut the fuck up.
-Bitcoin is not a competitor to the USD; its minuscule at best and our only real competition is China
-Bitcoin is great, but its not a replacement for USD.
Thats just off the top of my head.  Stop pretending like he's been pigeon holed into this stupid fuckin stance because he hasn't; and dumbasses trying to hand wave his stance away are only fooling themselves because no one else is stupid enough to believe that horse shit like what you posted above.  He couldn't be forced to say "Oh yeah there are no good nazis" or "its bad to lock up children" or "ya know what, saudi arabia shouldn't have chopped up that journalist" or "I demand that russia stop fucking with our elections" or literally anything else under the sun.

In the fact thats its plagued by ill-informed conspiracy theorists that base everything they know about it on something fox news said?  Sure, I guess so.
@_date: 2018-05-07 20:02:08
The fact that he thinks bitcoin needs to be able to be printed like money to make more of it is proof positive that he has absolutely zero fucking clue about what he's talking about.  He probably had some intern who is just as in the dark as him break it down using an analogy to something Buffet could easily understand like pork bellies or steel or something.  
The fact that there will never be more than 20mil bitcoins is a FEATURE, inherit BY DESIGN.  Imagine what the price of gold would look like if tomorrow we were able to say "this is exactly how much gold there is left, and thats it, no more will ever be mined after that because it'll all be out of the earth".  Just look at the price of helium over the last decade and even that can be [expensively] made.  
Bad analogies aside scarcity means there is value, and as demand increases the very finite scarcity of bitcoin will only drive the price higher.

So anyway.  Any of you guys want to trade me some BTC for these fucking baby heads, lightly used?  Now that I'm apparently amoral for holding these baby heads I might as well get into BTC too before the next ~~great recession or depression threatens to take my family's house away because a bunch of old fucking bankers did some shady shit that was and is totally out of my control because they are crooked and greedy as fuck and care only about profits even if it means millions of average people suffer~~ wave of new millionaires are made on traditional securities just like the prophecy of the central banks foretold!

Things I do want my tax dollars used for:
Human rights
And just so I'm 100% clear:
I'm fine bailing out farmers when we have a dry year.  
I'm fine bailing out farmers when they get hit with something unforeseen, like regulation changes (ie they need to invest $x into proper waste water management and need help paying the upfront cost)
I am not fine with bailing out anyone over a mistake they made.  IE corporate bailouts and bailouts being used to patch up the president's fuck ups.

I'm glad you could illustrate the fact that I've been right all along, you aren't reading what I say and you are just arguing against some made up version of me.
1.)  I've made points
2.)  You didn't care to read them
You seem to be taking everything this administration does and putting it on a pedestal where no one, internet or otherwise, is allowed to be critical of it without you white knighting.  
Turn about is fair play; if you would rather argue against some made up version of what I've said then I guess I will just do the same.
I would create a list of all the options that could've been taken but I don't have all night because the choices are, quite literally, nearly infinite.  But you would just hand wave it all away anyway because it didn't come directly from Trump's bigly brains.
Anyway, I'm done going round and round with you.  I learned a long time ago that arguing with a redcap is an exercise in futility; at least until the fog clears and yall leave your cult.  I've just been entertaining this discussion for passersby so they can see what the other side actually thinks and I think you've illustrated that quite nicely.
@_date: 2019-08-20 20:06:43
Consumers pay for tariffs so even if ALL tariff money was going to this and ZERO tax dollars I would still be footing the bill.
I knew, right up front, that you were going to have some kind of typical hand-wavium redcap response but I didn't know it would be this flagrantly retarded.  You kind of blind sided me a bit with just how dumb it was tbqh
@_date: 2019-08-20 20:47:29
So are ya gonna tell me why you think no administration before Trump used massive tariffs?
As to the rest of your bullshit:  go head and try to frame me as a china shill idgaf it'll be proof positive that you are trying to push the discussion elsewhere instead of addressing my points.


No, I've not sided with China a single solitary time; its your "all or nothing" dichotomy that says "because I don't agree with Trump, I must be Chinese".  I buy cost effective shit, man.  Nearly everyone in America does.  


Never said this either.  Keep trying to make a strawman out of me.  Keep trying to mischaracterized what I've said.  Keep trying to argue against points that literally no one has made except you, inside of your head, in this make believe argument you are having with some made up version of my and my statements.  I said there are BETTER ways; and there are.


No, I don't.  If I had my way something would've been done in the 80s to stop all of this from ever having got this far; but I'm not in charge.  There you go, putting words into my mouth again but you can't argue against my points.  Whats next, gonna say I claimed that Xi is a better president than Trump so therefore I must be Chinese case closed?


I do  But I'm not going to give you yet another thing to mischaracterize, bastardize, and build a strawman out of.
me: "illegal immigration is bad, but its not the main problem"
you: "this mother fucker said he loves illegals, wants no borders, and wants them all to be able to vote!"
That would actually be funny if it weren't true, and the actual approach that all of you redcaps have to literally anything.  All or nothing right?
@_date: 2019-08-20 20:34:38


So that somehow conflates, in your mind, to "tariffs only way, orange man genius!!!".
Alright then, Einstein, so tell me...if there is no other way, and thats why no administration in your lifetime has done it, then why do you think no administration in the past tried tariffs???

Even with the Tariff loads of Chinese shit is just cheaper than american made.  So buying Chinese you STILL save money, even though you are paying more.  Why would I want to buy even MORE expensive american made stuff?


I think this is really indicative of exactly how well you understand this subject, generally.  You're just reciting things you've heard from whatever pro-trump talking head or redcap echo chamber it is that you get your news from.  You've not educated yourself (or been educated) on the subject, you've done know research, and you are just harping on whatever bullshit someone poured into your noodle for you.  We export nearly 20% of our food, dingus.  Our "food supply" is in absolutely zero danger.  Before tariffs.  During tariffs.  After tariffs (because you know when Trump leaves the first thing that the person does who replaces him is going to be fix all his bullshit, right?)


That would play right into your cuckolding fantasy I'm sure but, nah.  No one wants that; but sane people with a grasp on the subject know that tariffs are not the only way to fix this.  Hell they are the dumbest most simplistic way to address it if we are being honest.
Do I really need to make a list for you?  I mean, you're just going to shrug it off anyway because daddy trump said tariffs are literally the only way, thats all you want to hear, and literally anyone and everyone who says otherwise is wrong and doesn't know what they are talking about, right?
BTW idk how Trump convinced so many gullible people that everything in life is a "zero sum game" but thats simply not true.  Its not only tariffs or no tariffs.  Its not 100% agree with the president or you are chinese.  Life doesn't work that way man, you'd do yourself a favor to stop treating everything that way.

1- Neither are "far-left"
2- zero mention of "kebab shops" in the first article.  Not one place have I said "this didn't happen" so showing me an article thats just talking about it happening is fuckin stupid but I guess par for the course for you.
3-  Second article mentions "takeaway restaurants".  Which is all kinds of foods.  They aren't "kebab shops" anymore than they are "fish and chips shops".  But calling them "fish and chips shops" would probably end up being racist towards the wrong group of people right?
So to summarize:
1- I'm not saying this didn't happen.  If you are trying to convince me it did then you are having an argument with your imagination, and wasting you time because I've not said otherwise.
2- "kebab shop owner" is still a racist dog whistle.  I've been on 4chan before too, kid.
3- I found your "source" for the whole "they cut little girls into pieces and made kebabs from them"

I honestly don't think we will ever see 3k again -ever.  Here's why
-right now if you average out the global cost per kwh of power and adjust for the amount needed to mine a bitcoin you land right around $6k usd.  This means that once btc dips below that mark it becomes more profitable -even if you start shutting down some rigs
-they simply dont have enough of the total supply of bitcoin to pull off a quick fast dump.  If anything they would create a fire sell of bitcoin and as soon as they sold their coins, others would immediately scoop them up because-
-the big financial titans are dipping their toes into the market.  if an opportunity comes where they can buy bitcoin below its kwh price then they will scoop it all up; it's a no brainer not to.
All of this is propped up against one central idea= that someone will always be out there who wants to accept bitcoin.  As long as there are people willing to buy sell and trade btc there is a market, and that market will always have a floor of the average kwh per coin and a ceiling of literally whatever someone is willing to pay.
This is why anytime BTC drops below that $6k sweet spot it seems to inexorably crawl back up.  Miners dial back mining to make their power consumption just below their btc price and viola, its self sustaining from there.

The steele dossier has had most of the contents corroborated or proven to be fact so I would assume the rest is also.  The only person(s) who really know are Mueller and his team, the sources of the information, and the various intelligence agencies that are looking into it.  This is the part you call an "investigation".  During this phase its bad investigatory practice to show your hand.  The evidence Mueller and co have found will come out during the "trial" so we just have to wait.
But if you are one of the many mouth breathers who buys into the narrative that a clandestine shadow government within our government is out to get Trump because he is somehow simultaneously an outsider but also controls (along with the rest of the Rs) every branch of government then there's never going to be enough proof.  Thankfully a tinfoil hat wearer can't change reality to suit their narrative.  I'm confident nothing I say here will change your world view if you are, and even if there was a video of ya boy donnie admitting guilt you'd still do some mental backflips and somehow find a way to blame hillary.

it was never "churn from the dnc running the wrong candidate".  believe it or not things do exist outside of "muh political affiliation" and that, when you break the law, it doesn't matter whether there is a D or R beside your name.

People who say this clearly have no idea how an investigation works, whatsoever.  If an investigator (detective or otherwise) goes around willy nilly telling everyone all the evidence they have uncovered then the criminals they are investigating have plenty of time to get ahead of it.  That's why investigators NEVER TIP THEIR HAND EARLY.  Think about it.  Actually think about it for yourself.

An ally that we have worked with on numerous things over the course of decades.


A real dossier with more content being proven factual on a nearly daily basis


Who the hell else would they give it to


Everything you disagree with isn't bullshit just because you don't like it.  Global warming for instance; its not any less real just because daddy says its not.


You mean to wire tap carter page.  Thats an important distinction.  If the trump campaign didnt want to get collaterally wrapped up in this they shouldn't have hired so many people affiliated with the russian government.  More over the warrants used to catch page were signed off on by 4 judges put into power by gop party members


The trump campaign did a pretty good job of doing this all on their own when their vetting process conveniently missed so many russian agents.


lol so yeah hows that going?  That whole "lock her up" thing?  It's gone no where in two years?  Thats a big ol shocker.  Why?  Because its actual fake news.

on mobile at the moment but one recent specific case sticks out in my mind:
back in late January the dollar took the biggest dip it had seen in about a year when Mnuchin said something about a weak dollar being good for trading.  Right around that same time volume of crypto took a hit.  It sticks out in my memory because several of my news source were talking about the correlation.
Of course, of course, of course thats not the only thing that drives the price of btc.  There are numerous factors.  Matter of fact we will have days where the two things diverge.  But the simple fact is when the dollar buys less people get greedy and when people are greedy there is less money flowing into crypto.
@_date: 2018-07-23 13:50:16
So you think grabbing on to one of the few remaining aspects that hasn't been proven [yet] makes enough of a case that the rest of it can be thrown out, in spite of all the evidence that the rest is true?

I'm not saying you are a supporter, or that you aren't; but anyone who will vilify Obama in one breath and then defend Trump by saying "well Obama did it" in the next clearly is astroturfing because they believe their hero can do no wrong.
And, as an aside, I think its just totally insane that a few short years ago we could all almost unanimously agree that the government shouldn't be trusted; now we have people who base their entire identity, ideaology, moral compass, everything around a POLITICIAN of all things; like their political party is some kind of football team or something.

It makes them a transwoman.
This is all very upsetting to you I can tell but at least you aren't advocating for hanging them or electro shocking them.  You are one step away from it, but not quite there yet so I will give you that at least.


Gender, whether you like it or not, does not exist in black and white.  For instance using your very own logic what is a person that is born with a penis and a vagina?  What about a person born with neither?  How about people born with XXY or XYY genotypes?  Are they just doomed to have their genders assigned by people like you?  Maybe chop off one of their sets of genitals?  


It is objectively mean when you say that a transman is still a woman.  Very mean in fact.  Vile, actually.  Very bigoted.  And utterly disgusting.

I don't know when this all happened but for some reason Trump came along and a not insignificant portion of the population just threw their hands up and said "fuck it" to logic and reason and sanity and chose to just endlessly defend this guy *no matter what*.

Thats some grade-a projection there.  You've spent all morning trying to convince me that transpeople have a mental disorder and somehow I'm the vile human being.  Good luck with that.  
It's funny that when I directly refute your claim of gender being black and white with actual examples of gender not being black and white that NOW you are tired of pushing your shit filled and nasty narrative of "a transwoman is still a man".

Well you think transgender people have a disorder so I assume, since to homosexual people can't procreate with one another, you think that is a disorder too or "unnatural".  If you don't then I apologize for painting you with a broad stroke; I know it probably sucks to have that done to you but since you are fine doing it to others hopefully you are fine with it being done to you.  Usually when people are bigoted towards one group they are bigoted towards all of them.


Except for when a person identifies as a different gender.


and a redcap is a redcap.  Like you, for instance, you are a redcap.  There are no other shades here, black and white, simple fact is you hold redcap opinions so therefore you are a redcap.

Why are you so obsessed with whats in someone else's pants?


And it upsets you very much that someone might want to be treated like a woman, while they have a penis.  I just dont understand the obsession I guess.  I say live and let live, if someone thinks feels acts like a woman and they want to be treated like a woman; fine by me.  It doesn't bother me or take any extra effort from me whatsoever.  But folks like you are truly upset about this and it takes tremendous effort on your parts so I guess to each their own.  You guys continue being unsufferably triggered by what genitals a person has all you want.  Its a free country.  Perhaps one day when you get over your obessions with transexual genitalia you can finally move on form all this.
More power to ya friendo.  Have a good one, and try not to bash any transexuals alright?
