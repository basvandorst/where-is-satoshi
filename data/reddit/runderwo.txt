Indeed, the presence of a state monopoly on enforcement of property rights (asserting a monopoly over deciding which rights to enforce and the manner in which they will be enforced) leaves no option to market participants but 'caveat emptor'.

If you take a second to scroll up just a little bit to where you started this very thread, you were *explicitly* referring to the charge of violation of the Bank Secrecy Act, not the charge of money laundering.  Unless Shrem failed to file a CTR/SAR in some situation *after* March 2013 when virtual currencies were ruled subject to MSB rules, there could be no violation of the BSA, whatever his status as a registered MSB and whatever other charges were piled on (such as the money laundering charge you've now changed the subject to).
It is actually 'downright embarrassing and seems like grasping at straws' for the government to file such a charge, but the reason to do so is obvious: leverage.

No, that's not at all 'generally' true.  All gifts to a single recipient are taxed to the donor when they total over $14,000 in a tax year.  The gift is a tax event in which you must determine the fair market USD value of the BTC.  The gift itself is then subject to gift tax if the amount of BTC given in the tax year is greater than the threshold.

The notion also exists, again in certain first-world countries, that non-payment of tax is to be treated like the non-payment of any other debt, that throwing people in prison generates negative income and that lower tax rates are a better deterrent to non-payment of tax than threats of prison.

I'll just end this thread by pointing out that you haven't the slightest clue what you're talking about, and by extension, the systematic violence you are spending your time defending.  Good day.
P.S. Americans who live in these "no infrastructure, no safety" countries are required to pay the U.S. government for every dime they make above the FEIE limit.
As another example, tax freedom day in Switzerland is in the month of January typically, but for a US citizen living in Switzerland tax freedom day comes at nearly the same day it would come if he were living in the US.  That's only fair, right, since in exchange for his tax he gets such benefits from the US government as having his bank accounts closed and mortgages rescinded due to legal threats.

Continuing to fund the American government to the degree it requires does a lot to discourage them from imposing their increasing authoritarianism on you.  And it's not as if they actually need your money to emerge as a totalitarian regime, since they can print all they want.  So I recommend paying them whatever they require in order to stay out of prison.
*Note that what they actually require is a lot less than what people  pay, because generally people aren't running their lives as businesses and taking advantage of the IRS's favorable treatment of businesses.  But those people aren't facilitating authoritarianism by overpaying the IRS, they're just throwing their money away.

It's more akin to corporate share issuance.  The network, in which a node is participating, slowly authorizes more and more shares as nodes find nonces that are solutions at the then-current difficulty.  Are corporations or their officers taxed when their officers authorize more shares?  No, the corporation is taxed when selling or compensating with shares, and the recipient of the shares is taxed when shares are issued to him in his _personal_ capacity.  Using this analogy, Bitcoin that originates in a coinbase transaction should be excluded from tax at least until the point when it's moved.

You haven't the slightest clue what you're talking about.  The tax rate of the particular country the US citizen lives in is _completely irrelevant_!  All that matters is the LEVEL of income and whether it exceeds the arbitrary FEIE limit.  A US citizen pays the resident country's tax rate on income below the FEIE limit and is double-taxed on income above the FEIE limit.
You're the one defending the US tax system as an extension of defending taxation in general, so the burden of proof is on you.  If the US takes people's money without providing anything of value to them, then it's only fair that people can in return avail themselves of its services without paying tax, especially when it places no legal barriers against their ability to do so.

So I send my 1.5 bitcoins to MtGox, or the biggest exchange at the time, to sell.  I try to sell, but the market is suddenly frozen due to 'technical reasons'.  Due to the panic, Bitcoin crashes to $14 over-the-counter (or whatever else constitutes "fair market value" without the biggest exchange), creating a loss of ~$3400.  I get my 1.5 bitcoins back through the court process, but I am left with a $875 tax bill with which I have a total of ~$100 worth of Bitcoin to pay.  Fortunately, I can write off up to $3000 of capital losses per year against my $3500 in income, nearly covering my tax bill in this particular case.

The US is the _only_ non-third-world country that taxes based on citizenship and not residency.
I already posted a list of a dozen countries with first-world standards of living and zero personal income tax.  In these countries, the US citizen with an income level above the FEIE limit is placed at an enormous tax disadvantage compared to the local population.  Here is the master list.
And no, "renounce your U.S. citizenship" is not a solution unless someone has dual citizenship -- _obviously_.
"In all seriousness", taxation is theft and the US is the gravest offender in the world by far.


I encourage people to use "public property" without paying what the government says they owe it.  After all, they're the public, and it's their property.  Whatever money the IRS takes out of their bank accounts is also their property.  Even a thief would admit that.

1. You have to trust Casascius has destroyed all copies of the private key
2. The buyer has to trust that you or anyone before you in the chain of custody has not accessed the private key through physical exploits
So use your head, but they are indeed an iconic item.  If you look at the graphics that mainstream media reports typically employ with bitcoin-related articles, Casascius coins are very often front and center.

Short answer: No.
Long answer: The scarcity is not in the amount of coin but in the hashrate that secures a blockchain against double-spending and other malicious forks.  An altcoin that gives 300 trillion coins per block is still not secure against attacks if not enough miners believe in its profitability to maintain a large enough hashrate to deter attackers.

If you give it to someone without a corresponding exchange, it's subject to gift tax.
Also, if you sell it to someone for money, it's subject to capital gains tax on the difference between your cost basis and the sales price.  If you traded it for goods and services, the open question is whether the IRS will consider this payment or barter.  In the latter case you would have to report your gain in the barter transaction as income.

Every in-the-bank transfer is reversible on the say-so of the source account holder.  Only interbank wire transfers require a court order in order to be reversed.

A US passport grants visa free travel to most of the world (172 countries) on the basis of mutual biometric data sharing, including much of the third world.  So "complex immigration processes" are largely a thing of the past.

Not true.  Altcoins do not have a Bitcoin Foundation type organization promoting the particular coin and funding development of the software.  They therefore do not have a public face that is able to be captured by ruling interests in order to transform the system into InflateCoin, GovCoin, or to sow enough divisive FUD from a podium that mindshare is destroyed.  That Bitcoin has such an identifiable, quantifiable coalition behind it can be a great advantage compared to altcoins, but it can also be a handicap if politics turns against Bitcoin.  In any case, altcoins' wagon is not hitched to Bitcoin and they may turn out to be a valuable alternative against 'tail risk'.

Obviously it's better for underpaid, non-unionized floor scrubbers to be unemployed if their productivity is greater than their current wage but less than the statutory minimum wage.

I finally received two support replies to my Friday request today after solving the problem on this thread.  Both replies are an extreme puzzle to me.
One reply indicated confusion.  Nikolaus said that he was glad I was able to log in using my e-mail address.  But that is wrong.
Got information that you finally managed to log in by using your e-mail address as an username.

LocalBitcoins Support
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------
Then I got this other support reply 3 hours later also indicating confusion and being utterly wrong as well.  Note that this reply is concerned that I am not receiving his replies or not replying to them, yet this email is a reply to a reply that I made; it has my reply quoted below it!
Hi!                                                                                                                                                                                                               
I am pretty certain that the problem is somewhat related you using two e-mail accounts:  XXXXX and XXXXX.spam so that you are not getting my e-mails, or you are not least replying them properly. There are at least 3 e-mails where I have answered, and probably you have not received all of them.
Looks like you finally managed to log in by using your e-mail address instead of username. I suggested trying that in one e-mail (sent last week) we did not get answer to. Also, there is a text in the login form   which says: 'If you have forgot your username, try logging in with your email' [...]
 -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
So let me be clear:  I was only able to login with my USERNAME once 2FA was enabled.  Logging in by e-mail address, which I was ALWAYS able to do prior to enabling 2FA (including after the recent system changes) no longer works once 2FA is enabled, despite that being the implied recommended method in the support replies.
Let me also be clear that I replied to every support request, from email accounts which I have no problem replying to others with (one is just a +spam account to limit UCE) so you need to improve your helpdesk system e.g. to send confirmation e-mails after ticket replies so that support staff cannot deny having seen a support request followup.

If seller A wants to sell coin to buyer B at some agreed price, A sends coin to Casascius for verification that hologram is intact along with some fee, say 1 BTC.  Casascius then forwards coin to buyer B with a certificate that the coin has not apparently been tampered with.
Maybe even insurance.  For a further fee, you could enclose the verified coin in a tamper proof casing like NGC/PCGS coin cases before sending to buyer B.  If coins are spent and non-tampered case and coin is returned to you, buyer B gets reimbursed the face value of the coin.

Well yes, the sender could not reverse it, but the bank sure could.  $$$$.  Lesson learned: cash settlement only.  And do not use Bank of America.
BTW, I filed an OCC complaint and the bank came back and told me to pound sand.  So don't expect to see your BTC or money again.

Like any other Bitcoin wallet/exchange while the Bitcoin economy is still in amateur hour, they're only "reputable" in the sense that they haven't *yet* suffered a high profile hack.

If the Bitcoin Foundation wants to relegate Bitcoin to just another altcoin in the cryptocurrency universe, so be it.

She is a socialist.  No level of tax would be high enough.  Imagine any tax rate you personally think is 'correct', and then try to imagine her not pursuing a higher one.  In addition, the voluntary part of the economy is at fault in all conflicts and the state is always the solution.

Switzerland is not a European country and is therefore not liable for eurozone debts under even the loosest interpretation of the surrounding theories.  However, the central bank, being untethered from the gold standard since a 1999 referendum, currently feels free to bail out the eurozone without further consultation of the people through a massive eurozone bond purchase program.

Don't feel bad.  I took a bank wire transfer for $2500.  Unfortunately at the time I didn't know that in-the-bank transfers were treated differently from interbank wire transfers with respect to fraud claims.  The buyer made a fraud claim and took my money and the bitcoin.
Bank wire transfers can be taken safely for bitcoin but you must ensure the buyer is sending the wire from a bank that is not your own.  In that case, once the recall period has passed, a court order is required to reverse the transfer.

That is indeed the pretext, just as the Federal Reserve's massive U.S. government bond purchases are advertised as an effort to reduce unemployment and increase house prices by reducing prevailing interest rates.  But in the end: cui bono?

They could rootkit your computer in which case they can log keys, read files, whatever, including your private key.
They could also legally break into a wallet hosting service and deanonymize your wallet address, if not steal your coins while they're there.

Ebay has rewards for the buyer and allows payment with a credit card, making it easier for the buyer to pay a higher price.  Ebay also will side with the buyer in any Bitcoin-related fraud claim, making it harder for the seller to sell at a lower price.
