but be aware not to send bch to a btc wallet ot the other way around.

i think it was just an  post somewhere that got deleted or down voted. but it can't be changed on the usual websites because ther is a webside that checks the links to the whitepaper to the hashed whitepaper in the blockchain..

we want decentralised mining and yet you keep telling ppl not to mine common guys. 
but its so important that everyone runs a full node? yah for a standalone miner and business but thats it... 
do you even know how bitcoin works?
to mine profitable you need uo to date gear. like bitmain s9 or the upcoming avalon 8. 
and with changing difficulty it may or may not still be profitable after 6 months. everytime a big mining company opens difficulty rises. and today 16nm asic chios are the best end if next year it will be 7nm chips.. 
i own one avalon miner with 4 th. atm. still profitable but im mining in a pool. will maybe buy the new one with my bch gains.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:15:41
its creator?  the devs of btc created bch after countless discussions.
. the only ones getting scammed right now are noobs buying btc an loosing they're money to fees.
thats not good for all bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:12:14
bitcoin does not have a ceo. so you are saying BTC is decentralised with blockstream and blockstream dev team? the community is the leaders not blockstream. we need more dev teams! but lots of the devs have left BTC.
this reddid still recommends newbys to buy bitcoin.
they will end up buying 50$ and loosde half of it for fees.
this does not push mass adoption anymore.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:35:18
because bch is awesome?
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:21:58
1000$ miner wont be that profitable.  also its hard to get some antminer s9 these days. last preorder finished some weeks ago.
they are also selling on eBay 2x the price.
if you don't pay for power look for something in the 5 th range i belive antminer s7 have around 4Th and if you are lucky you find one in ebay or used.
lots if scamy web shops unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:38:07
no need to insult me. yes we obviously disagree on many things but thats how discussions work and does not make me a shill. keep up the good work ny insulting people and denying what is happening around us
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:28:28
send him bitcoin cash. use a paperwallet for example. show  them how it works. its fun to send money around if you dont have fees. 
im doing the same this year.
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:00:43
it already is regulated
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:05:36
just like coinbase, bitfinex and other exchanges then. but i doubt it.
get some sw developer to investigate it? i know it is a fork of the copy wallet and it is doing the same because it used multisig. but you are aware that your wallet cound still send yout key after you created it? or even after some weeks after you created it? who knows. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:00:52
i think its the right one. there is also one at bitcoin.org but its the same i think. there where attempts to spread a changed version some time ago.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:05:49
it reads bch for me but buying is disabled anyways. probably because of high traffic.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:56:04
whatever works and gets adoption is bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:36:04
depends on how much fees you want to pay.
range from 30min to 3 days .
check the diagram of the mempool to see what the currently highest transactions fees are.
low fees seem to get stuck forever and denied after some time but don't take my word in that.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:26:58
or they will replace the leding persons and manipulate the masses. in my book tbh as long as bitcoin is waiting for LN i will use bch and consider it more in line with SN whitepaper. i will give your link a read now.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:08:30
lol what?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:33:42
you dont seem to know how bitcoin works.. its open source by nature. its an evolving ecosystem
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:12:42
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:52:22
yes look at the facts and you will find btc has become completely.useless. don't listen to people on reddid always do your own research and verify every source.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:53:24
it would still end up being decentralised enough when you take all miners in account. from a tecnical side it should be sufficient if only miners and mining pools have full nodes. most small miners don't even run nodes only bigger miners and pools/business do but it is all spread out around the globe.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:35:58
more memes to lure in small minded people so they can get screwed by the fomo and the high fees?  i wonder if anyone is still listening to you guys... the greater fools are disappearing
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:50:15
relex i just sent some bitcoin from coinbase to my wallet and was confirmed immediately. oh wait! i didn't use btc but bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:36:21
slow flippening
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:55:33
just helped some guy that wanted to give away btc as a Christmas gift. i tried to point him to better options..
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:01:02
also the current btc is also a fork from the original bitcoin. they had forced consensus for segwit and as we know segwit is completely useless. thats why we have forks now. to improve or revert to the original version. also bch for example was not forked out if the current btc but from the previous version without segwit. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:50:23
please google these questions. you find plenty of information online.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:56:42
its not an attack. its a different version with different scaling solution.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:55:38
yes. that's typical for btc atm. for fast transactions use bitcoin cash or litecoin.
but i have found bch works the best. btc is waiting for lightning network but it is a work in progress for years now and will still take more time.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:51:02
asic miners like the s9 can mine coins that supports asic. like bitcoin and bitcoin cash.
gpu and cpu mining has lots if disadvantages like attack options and lead to mining farms as well while driving the price of gaming hardware up. 
asic is the best option imo. but gear is expensive loud and power hungry
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:51:19
in don't spend much time hear. but compared to 3 weeks ago its completely different.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:20:32
poor guy. make sure you use high enough fee otherwise it wont arrive till Christmas
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:23:14
as far as i know energy consumption is not that high as some say. but efficiency can be improved by a lot with increasing blocksize.
lots if miners in eu are mining next to hydro power plants (mining hosts?)
in my home country we have several companies that offer space and power for a monthly fee but you have to have your own mining gear.
how much power is consumed by banks? or machines to mine metals or print the almighty $?
there is a nice article but as my math prof. always told me.
never trust statistics that you did not fake yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:26:09
sadly true
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:15:46
probably because the version in github is newer and not officially released on theyr website or play store.
my guess.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:20:44
nobody is listening to you guys anymore
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:47:16
something changed around here... people openly arguing against bitcoin without getting banned or posts removed?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:23:00
number is correct you need a good power supply to run it.
the antminer s9 draws around 1500wh just look at the specs of the miner.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:56:52
look at all the bitcoin forks? most if them where fake attempts to make quick money.
only one sofar provided a different aproach to a problem. the rest pretty much died off becauss there was no community behind.
ther is even a website to get your own bitcoin fork traderjoecoin if you like. 
the thing that makes it something special is the community behind and the passion to drive adoption. not the get rich quick ticket.

bad example. traffic is less congested with more lanes but the remaining congestion comes from human error.  so in the virtual highway more lanes means less congestion as no human error
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:32:57
dud im not a shill. i am allowed to disagree.
i prefer the bitcoin that works. everyone can do theyr own research but i recommend doing it outside of reddid.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:26:48
we have to switch to renewables anyways. wind solar and water are far more sustainable than coal or other fossil energy sources.
let's hope some rich bitcoiners invest in renewables instead if buying lambos and giant mansions.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:52:20
better google the whitepaper and make sure to read the real version of it. not sure if this one is the original.
