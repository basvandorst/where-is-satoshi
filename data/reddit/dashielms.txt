**no, no, no!** it's a common misconception that bitcoins are mined using proof-of-work. in fact the distributed nature of the blockchain allows simultaneous random insertions of "litecoin" into the wallets of any user. the proof of work is essentially a distributed random-number generator that ensures the wallet is chosen fairly. 
eventually, a critical mass of litecoins within a single wallet is reached and the wallet spawns a bona-fide bitcoin (the digital objects we exchange for services or fiat currency). 
the takeaway lesson, and the single greatest problem facing bitcoin (until recently, of course), is the fact that wallets used to be able to be created en masse. due to the randomized distributed nature of litecoin assignments in the blockchain, the person with the most wallets will stand the highest chance of receiving litecoin and creating a critical mass. today of course, the litecoins are no longer distributed using proof of work random variable assignments and instead sublimate directly from the cloud.
the github spork that moved the blockchain into the cloud essentially removed the last known method of cheating lightcoin assignments, and coincided with the recent spike in bitcoin value relative to fiat currency.

okay, a little bit of jargon goes a long way but basially your take-home lesson is to avoid ASIC mining scams and either invest directly in bitcoin, or purchase one of vesp.ca's 3d printed "social wallets", which nullify the latest game-theoretic cloud sublimation methods using stallman's famous solution to the NP-complete "quantum axlotl node-traversal problem". sure it's an arms race, but investing in the leading edge has been proven (just check mt-gox!) to yeild consistent gains on your investment of up to 20% compounded logarithmically.
