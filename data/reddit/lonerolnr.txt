Libra is the opposite of what cryptocurrency is meant to be. Libra is centralized, controlled by giant corporations and private interests, as well as extremely vulnerable to censorship. Ugh, no thanks...

I'm not sure I would agree that it is solely supply and demand given that Bitcoin has cryptologic/hash value as well

Hodling doesn't hurt Bitcoin. Even shorting BTC doesn't hurt Bitcoin as much as one would believe. What hurts Bitcoin the most is when people don't look at it for its underlying technology. People are looking at Bitcoin through a greed perspective rather then the perspective that its this revolutionary new form of currency that can be used to do good.
