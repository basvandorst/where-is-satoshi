Your 2 days too late. I just ordered some more gear for the season. I will say this though, I really like the selection of shoes you have! I almost bought some of the Anasazi pinks the other day. But didn't really want to spend $150 when I could get the verde's for much cheaper and some more gear with it. :)
@_date: 2014-01-25 08:03:17

Dont be worried. I've used Snapcard quite a bit and i'm not sure on this, but i don't think they fulfill orders around the clock. So your order should go through first thing in the morning. As long as the item hasn't sold that your trying to buy on eBay.

I almost shit myself right now, not sure if its you or the coffee. :|
@_date: 2017-03-03 01:53:20
Is that 6% the optional promotion fee? I pay anywhere from 13-17% in fee's on TCGPlayer depending on order sizes, but it is hard to beat their access to buyers on that platform.
@_date: 2017-03-02 08:50:19

Honestly your choice of coins isn't very bad, lots of those are on my shortlist of what I think hedge funds will be buying. But when you choose to buy after the greatest bull run the alts have seen your going to have a very bad time. The only upside from your trades is that you've bought a very expensive lesson that you wont soon forget.
