Only thing he changed is his location to federal prison. Hahaha

"According to Ars Technica, the defense screwed up."
I don't think the defense screwed up. There was just nothing to defend him with, except blaming Mark Karpeles and telling the jury what a nice guy he is and saying "the internet is not what it seems to be".
What you wanna do if you get caught red handed with a laptop full of evidence and $18000000 in bitcoin from silk road wallets?

" so if they get a second shot maybe they can succeed to get it in."
This ship has sailed.

No. Evidence was just too strong.
Kid shouldn't have saved all kind of shit on his laptop.
He was basically too dumb to run a black-market empire.

This is good for Bitcoin.
+5.098% since conviction already.
To the moon!

I'd go so far as to say that Dratel saw Ulbricht and his family as a tasty pay day and encouraged him to go to trial thinking of the six figure sum rather than what would be right or proper.
(Which in this case and knowing what was on that laptop would have been pleading out 13 months ago).
Does Dratel really believe Ulbricht was framed?

Bitcoin is very safe and is clearly used by the best and the brightest

The charges were not dropped. He is indicted in Baltimore on the murder-for-hire charges.
The murder-for-hire case is U.S. v. Ulbricht, 13-00222, U.S. District Court, District of Maryland (Baltimore).
If he is sentenced in NY today, they will not need that case (since he is off to prison for the next decades anyways), if he is aquitted in NY today, he will be off to Maryland on the murder-for-hire situation.
