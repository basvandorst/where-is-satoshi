OMG 
This is illuminati confirmed shit
Santa is in the moon 
So btc will moon too
It's obvious!
@_date: 2018-09-15 11:30:23
Calm down bro
Why so angry
@_date: 2018-09-15 09:38:10
Mayer Moon is imminent.
@_date: 2018-09-15 11:32:18
Not to mention that bitcoin has way cooler memes than gold
@_date: 2018-09-24 12:22:27
No the orders were put manually.
Why is your software limited to BFX accounts?
@_date: 2018-09-24 15:13:26
Most exchanges will at least send you an email one time login code by default.
But not BFX. 
But they said they will give information to law enforcement about attackers freezed account.
After that they will release remaining balance.
Police is trying to get information about IP in the meantime.
At least it was a dumb guy not using VPN.
@_date: 2018-09-23 20:30:08
No I didnt. Big mistake.
But what I dont get is that Bitfinex shows no Recent Withdrawals.
But no balance of theese shit tokens either.
And they didnt take all funds?!
Its confusing.
And I dont assume that an entire exchange was hacked but you can never know so its just fair to inform others about suspicious activity.
And maybe some one else has the same problem.
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:01:51
Fuck crypto!
He is damn right 
Buying at ath's sucks man!
@_date: 2018-09-23 21:06:42
Yes not enabling 2fa was my fault but has bitfinex some Kind "suspicious activity system"?!
Because all withdrawals are disabled in my account and nobody tried to enable them.
Recent Withdrawals showing no withdrawals.
It looks like they maybe locked or froze the balance of theese tokens. Is that possible? 
Already contacted Support. 
I see Just those orders that my btc and usd were exchanged in ZCN PAI and ORS ?!?
Anybody has an idea?
@_date: 2018-09-24 07:49:06
Just an update:
Bitfinex Support replied there are more accounts with the same problem like me and the attacker extracted funds by trading markets with wide spreads (with his/her own account)
@_date: 2018-08-28 09:39:40
Maybe you are wrong. Technical chart analysis already implied those different circumstances you have mentioned.
Otherwise chart would maybe look different.
@_date: 2018-08-01 09:31:42
True for this year 
But sometimes you go pretty good with altcoins.
Have you missed those altcoin bull cycles in the past?
Hope you dont miss them in the future :D
@_date: 2018-08-09 10:15:09
Ok I give you 3000$ for 1 Btc!
Better than 0!
@_date: 2018-05-22 19:04:53
Yes, we can!
@_date: 2018-05-17 14:41:59
What 10 years?!
Need lambo sooner 
It will soon go to the moon, they said :(

Bitcoin is the new dishwasher
@_date: 2018-06-13 09:40:34
This is normally the time when people buy altcoins at the bottom of alt/btc Charts.
Which means btc dominance drops again.
Look at long time btc dominance.
Decreasing from the beginning.
In 3 years maybe it's unser 20% or even lower.
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:43:34
Bro, do you even Stop Loss
@_date: 2018-06-13 10:31:02
Volumen of altcoins at the bottom is always low.
And then high again at the top.
Just the normal cycle.
@_date: 2018-11-17 17:52:14
This looks more than 1 kilogram of meat.
@_date: 2018-11-10 23:23:34
This is the most nonsense comparison I've ever seen on Bitcoin Reddit.
And I am a Bitcoin believer..
@_date: 2019-01-31 11:55:27
They could send letters to exchange information around the world at high prices with slow delivery time.
And then they invented email.

2.1 Btc are now 20.000$...to the moon!
@_date: 2018-07-20 08:37:57
I doubt that, the downtrend is getting faster since last year.
And altcoin dominance uptrend is also getting faster. 
Seems people are getting more and more interest in altcoins over time.
Maybe the best is to hold BTC and some very well selected Altcoins. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 05:57:09
Double Top?
BTC Market dominance has been going down only.
Zoom out :)
In maybe one year dominance of "others" will cross btc dominance.
@_date: 2018-07-25 09:37:58
Only because you don't see it, doesn't mean others can't see a business use for Iota haha
@_date: 2018-07-18 05:58:39
We should pin that thread on top.
@_date: 2018-07-20 19:43:29
Why freak out?
It was 95% in 2014 and going down from there only
@_date: 2018-07-20 19:46:39
Big if true!
@_date: 2018-07-18 05:42:34
I did it too.
Thank you!
Lets bust their Email Servers :D
@_date: 2018-07-20 10:07:55
True if big
@_date: 2018-07-26 09:54:47
You know you're too deep into Crypto if you loose a shitload of money within a funny correction afternoon, where normal people would collapse and cry on the floor.
You take a deep breath and think: "Damn, ok, whatever..it's gonna recover soon"  :D
Or you think: "Ok -20%, could have been worse!"
@_date: 2018-07-12 21:40:40
The-2014-bull-run-never-happens-again-fanboys were telling the same in 2015
Whoops, Deja-vu? :D
But ok THIS time is different!
LAST time was different, too
Everything different :D
@_date: 2018-07-20 19:41:17
Shhhhh...you can't say that in here..
Hail BTC!
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:09:11
Girls do not think I have a pile of money in my arms
@_date: 2018-04-28 04:40:00
Piles of money make several bitches affordable.
But I would only do this for my friends!
@_date: 2018-07-06 09:51:24
It wont go to 0 because I will at least buy 1 Bitcoin for 1$.
Maybe I go wild and buy 2 Bitcoin then.
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:07:12
Printing counterfeit bitcoin is fraud!
@_date: 2018-12-29 00:27:46
Yea well, I think there is a bigger chance that the attacker beats the shit outta ya to get your passphrase before he or she hacks it, in case of physical access...
