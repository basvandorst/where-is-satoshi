CTO here. They have kind of the same scalability mechanism as the one we rolled out some months ago. They're mostly an API and we're more product focused. They is room for everybody!

We are Bitcoin lovers and we know that the blockchain couldn't exist without a cryptocurrency. Bitcoin to the moon!

Kind of similar to Tierion's, using Merkle trees. We'll publish more info soon :)

Of all the projects out there, I'd never put Akasha under any kind of doubt. Mihai, co-founder, also co-founded Bitcoin Magazine and Ethereum with Vitalik, so they are very good friends. Plus Mihai has never been guided by greed and hype, quite the contrary actually.
I'm not saying we shouldn't be skeptic about some projects, I'm just encouraging you to do your due diligence before throwing false accusations.

Yep, good question. You have to trust the software of the servers that you use, just like you trust other exchanges such as MtGox or Bitstamp.
Note that the software itself is not P2P, but it is the way it works (e.g. there is not a central bank account or wallet)

Sorry for the video, I tried to remove the noise but there's still some.
So, as this is a trading platform, we are thinking about payment processors with APIs and also without chargebacks, such as OKPay.
What I refer when talking about that there are not bank accounts to close, is that a government can close an exchange's bank account (Bitcoin24 and Tradehill are some recent examples) but they can't close every single OKPay account that has used Pauv, since there would be a lot (one per user actually)
Let me know if you have any other questions, or if you think something should be specified better in the campaign's page :)
