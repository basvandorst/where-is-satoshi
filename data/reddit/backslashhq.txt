Thanks for the suggestions! We could implement payments the way you described, but there are a couple reasons why we chose a different implementation: 
1. Our current system lets us confirm transactions instantly. In your suggested implementation, the sender would need to wait several block times to safely spend his/her BTC. 
2. Since Backslash transactions are off the blockchain, we're able to offer zero fees.

**We do not not sell your phone numbers.** There is another reason why we hold onto phone number data though.
We have plans to add 2-factor authentication, and we'd need to keep phone numbers on file to do that anyways. The phone number verification we built today was a first step to that, which is why it didn't make sense to implement a no-trust solution.
This was just a nice way for us to give a bit of BTC to people, which is why it's easy to skip the phone number entry step during signup. You don't have to put your phone number in if you don't want to.

Hey outofofficeagain,
Great question!
The primary difference between Backslash and ChangeTip is the way you send Bitcoin. Backslash uses an auto-completing search to help you find your recipient, and payments are kept private, while ChangeTip payments are generally made through public posts (ex. reddit comments, tweets).
This difference stems from different goals of the products: ChangeTip is built for online tipping, while Backslash is targeted at more general peer to peer payments (ex. paying a friend back for dinner).
Backslash also lets you send Bitcoin to email addresses and friends on Facebook.
I hope that makes sense! Feel free to ask any follow up questions that come to mind.

Hi careful12,
We're glad you brought this up, because it gives us an opportunity to clarify what Backslash is designed to do and tell you a bit about our security policies.
We go through a many steps to make sure your BTC is safe, but let me preface this by saying that **Backslash is not meant to hold large sums of Bitcoin**. We're trying to build the best way to send and receive Bitcoin, not a bank for BTC. That means we make some compromises on security to increase usability.
All money is currently held in what are effectively hot wallets, though we have multiple layers of indirection between the wallet storage and the greater internet so this isn't a fully accurate description. We plan to set up cold storage once the total deposited amount increases. The machine responsible for signing transactions is cut off from the internet, as are the private keys, so the keys are never read on a machine that is directly accessible from the greater internet. We believe these measures, along with following best practices with regard to general web security and fire walling, are enough to limit the potential impact of a compromise.

I'm glad you think Backslash looks nice!
We're building Backslash because we want an easier way to send Bitcoin to each other and to our friends. This was a problem that really bothered us, so we love working on it.
We started working on Backslash a couple months before graduating from college, and we've been working on it full time ever since. We never had any jobs to quit :)
Feel free to email us at team if you're still skeptical!

We're not funded or sponsored. 
We've been bootstrapping so far using money saved up from past internships. Our costs are very low so we can keep this up for the foreseeable future.

We're working closely with legal advisors to implement a reasonable policy.

The only losses we take are on server costs and the incentives we provide. For on-blockchain transactions we pass the miner fee on to you (you'll see a small note if you pay a Bitcoin address), but transactions to other Backslash users are 100% free.
@_date: 2014-12-17 23:56:39
Thanks! I'd love to hear what you think. We're always trying to improve Backslash.

Since we're giving away Bitcoin to new users, we need to have a way to make sure people can't create unlimited accounts. We found that phone number verification is the quickest and easiest way for us to make sure that each account belongs to a different, real person.

Backslash is not working with or associated with Deutsche Bank.

We have a rewards program so that new users can immediately try sending Bitcoin after creating an account. 
If we didn't give out bits and someone who's never used Bitcoin signed up for Backslash, they wouldn't really be able to do anything. In order to send their first payment, they would first need to sign up for an exchange, buy some BTC, and then send it to Backslash. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:20:09
Hey We launched Backslash for Dogecoin a couple of months ago, and added Bitcoin support last week. We hope you'll check it out!
Backslash has a rewards program to help you make your first payment. When using Backslash, you’ll receive:
- 10 bits for adding your phone number
- 5 bits for connecting your Facebook account
- 20 bits for each friend you invite
We know Backslash isn’t perfect yet, but we really want to hear your thoughts and feedback about it. Feel free to reach out to us by comment here, private message, or email to team
All the best,
Paul and Roneil

Thanks for that info, rydan, we weren't aware of the market price for verified phone numbers. We are going to be experimenting with the amount of bits we give out, and we'll definitely consider that info when we we are choosing final amount.

To make a 2-factor solution that works across all kinds of phones we still need to hold onto phone numbers. We'd prefer not to require that users install GoogleAuthenticator or Winauth due to the complexity that would add, but may offer those as options for those who prefer not to share their phone number.
@_date: 2014-12-17 20:39:52
Nice! What are you working on? 
Right now there's just two of us:

Hey philjones85,
We don't make money yet, nor do we plan to for the foreseeable future. We're exclusively focused on making it easy to send and receive Bitcoin with the people you care about.
That said, we have some plans for premium offerings we can add on top of the functionality the service has now. We will never charge fees for the basic transaction functionality that Backslash has today, including deposits and withdrawals to and from Backslash.

I'd love to hear your suggestions for providing 2-factor authentication to feature phones (not smartphones) without using a phone number.
Just to summarize our reasoning, phone numbers provided an easy way to uniquely identify users and were a good first step towards a universal (works on all phones) 2-factor authentication solution. We should have phrased this more succinctly, so I apologize for that.

No worries, it's a good question. 
The miner fee isn't always a big deal, but it can be prohibitive for small payments. 
One major advantage is that off-chain transactions are instant. There's no need to wait for any confirmations, so you can spend your Bitcoin immediately after your receive it. 
Another feature that a lot of our users like is our autocomplete search. When you use Backslash to send a payment, you can just start typing someone's name and you'll see them pop up automatically. It's easier than having to lookup up or ask for their service-specific username or Bitcoin address.

I'm biased, but yes, I think it is. We've tried to make Backslash as easy and simple as possible, so that new Bitcoin users start using it quickly. Here are a couple reasons why I think it's a good fit:
* Signing up is very easy. You only need a username, email, and password.
* We have an onboarding flow that gives new users a small amount of Bitcoin to get started. They can send their first payments without having to buy or deposit bitcoin. 
* We've made it very easy to send Bitcoin to users even if they don't have a Backslash account yet. You can send Bitcoin to Facebook friends, people you follow on twitter, or any email address. Once the recipient gets the payment, they can easily create an account to claim their Bitcoin.

- There's still a ton of work that needs to be done to make Bitcoin more accessible, and mobile apps play a huge role. 
- We are definitely not going to be coasting. We have tons of ideas for features and improvements that we're working hard to release as soon as we can. 
- Our main approach to solve that issue is to reduce the amount of understanding needed to use Bitcoin. At the moment it's difficult for users to spend their Bitcoin or convert it to their local currency efficiently. That is definitely something we want to improve. 
- We currently have a Coinbase integration. It lets you send Bitcoin to a Coinbase account, which you can use to convert your BTC into cash in approximately 20 countries.

Marshall is correct. The majority of transactions on Backslash are off-chain, and are therefore instant and free. The only exception is when you're sending Bitcoin to an external address. This includes the miner fee, which goes to the Bitcoin network, not to us. 
Payment links are also an effective way to receive payments from non-Backslash users. If a visitor that isn't logged into Backslash clicks your payment link, they will see your payment page. Your page includes a Bitcoin address and QR code, that visitors can send you Bitcoin **without having to create a Backslash account**.

Here is ours:  !!! We think that transparency is incredibly important and completely agree with you. 
There's a link to it in our footer and in our landing page, but we'll work on making more prominent.
