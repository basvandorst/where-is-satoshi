Bitcoin and Gold, Bosom Buddies?
Bitcoin used to have a mind of its own.  Prior to the last three months, the digital currency traded with the ebbs and flows of merchant acceptance. The following chart illustrates my point, it is the 30 day change in the price of bitcoin plotted against the 30 day change in the amount of bitcoin transactions.
There is a clear negative correlation between price movements in bitcoin and the amount the digital currency is being used for transactions.  My simple explanation for this inverse relationship is that as new merchants begin accepting bitcoin they immediately sell it for fiat currency.  This has meant that contrary to popular opinion, in the short run merchant acceptance is not good for the price of bitcoin. Of course, in the long run merchant acceptance is essential to the growing bitcoin ecosystem.
However, something different has been occurring over the last three months - bitcoin has begun trading in lockstep with gold. The following chart shows the prices changes in bitcoin and the gold ETF over the preceding 90 days.
I will be the first to scoff that correlations are made to be broken, but the relationship does have some basis in economics. One characteristic of bitcoin is its limited supply (only 21 million coins will ever exist). As well, like gold it is a currency and I would argue it is a better currency than gold.  Unlike gold, bitcoin can be used to purchase goods and services, just try buying something on Overstock with gold…you wont get too far.
So is bitcoin doomed to be the digital cousin of gold? Hardly. In fact I find it encouraging that it has begun to take on the trading characteristics of more mature financial markets.  As bitcoin matures more speculators will be attracted to the market and the simple act of converting some gold holdings into bitcoin could have a dramatic effect on price.  
The Bitcoin Investment Trust has a handy little table that indicates what could happen to the price of bitcoin if only a small portion of the investment dollars in gold migrated to the digital currency.
If bitcoin equaled only 5% of the value of gold, the implied price would be $47,010…quite a jump from the  current $335!  To be sure, taking on the characteristics of gold is not a one way ticket to the moon.  If bitcoin is disrupting gold as the ultimate store of value, it will also be subject to the downside.
The promise of Bitcoin the technology is the disintermediation of financial services…perhaps the digital currency is fulfilling its destiny and has chosen to start with gold.

@_date: 2014-03-28 10:35:50
The start-ups are not Bitcoin specific, but more about cryptocurrencies in general. If you buy Bitcoin, you need Bitcoin to get big. Most of the start-ups can, however, switch to any cryptocurrency they want if shit hits the fan for Bitcoin.
You can switch to any other crypto too.

Providing liquidity
To provide liquidity, you first have to make sure your deposit wallet contains USD or BTC. If not, you can go to the Manage Wallets page to transfer funds into this wallet.
Go to the "Liquidity swaps" page to put your offers. Here, choose your conditions for the swap you propose:
    Choose the amount of liquidity you want to provide (amount) .
    Choose for how many days you would like to offer this liquidity (period) .
    Choose at which rate (in % per day) you want to offer swap
    When you're all set, click on "Offer Now". Your offer will appear in the "Unfilled demands/offers" table. When it will be taken, you will see the opened positions in the "Funds currently offered" table.

For wide adoption, we need small payments (coffee/drinks) with low or no fees. 
Layer two (lightning) can take care of this.
The adoption rate will explode because of the ultra fast and cheap transactions.
This will boost layer one transactions also because users get more confidence in BTC and will use it more and more, for bigger and bigger transactions.
By implementing seg-wit and lightning the miners will benefit hugely with more transactions and more profit.
Richt now I am transacting 90% less with bitcoin and I am not the only one, this can't be good for the miners in the long run.
