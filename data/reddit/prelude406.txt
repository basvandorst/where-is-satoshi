all original cost of a bitcoin will all be traced back to the miner cost, even if the investor "bought" the coin. since they would be buying it from the miners. so you only need to find out the cost of the miner.
 i think you can kinda estimate the ball park figure of the upper bound. Assume a rational miner will only mine when its profitable to do so, the total amount invested will be integral of number of mined coins with respect to average price of btc at the time of each block.

it will be the total amount of electricity used by all miners worldwide for mining every single blocks since the genesis block, multiply by the cost of electricity in their respective facilities. Now find out the data and calculated it.

Supply is getting cut in half is known fact. However where the demand will be is unknown. To calculate the price of an asset, you need to know both supply and demand. So halvening is not priced in.

Bitcoin is digital gold. Nuff said.

because USD is inflationary  and can be print out of thin air without bound by the fed. Bitcoin has finite amount, 21 million max. Not a satoshi more even if we want to.

I guess he's trying to ask if one private key can have one legacy address and one segwit address, when you spend from a legacy address, will the spending also reflected on the segwit address, since they both corresponding to the one same private key.

Stealing your jobs? Ok if you wanna cook Chinese food or make less than a dollar per hour making products for Walmart and amazon then yes, they stole your jobs.

You don’t know if the dog tags maker can read the memory of the tag maker machine do you? They could steal your keys

If they can automate your jobs why would they need to hire you? Our enemy is the fed and wall st my dear. They print money and inflate your savings and creates economic bubbles to rub ur investments. This is why we need Bitcoin. My dear :) quit the china bashing.

Last time I check the Chinese government did not say anything about closing the miners. The fake documents about gfw circulating lately had been verified by official as fake. Also it will be considered a degrade in security of Bitcoin if the number of hash power is suddenly lower due to china exiting the mining space.

See even American are censoring internet

Good luck bring jobs back home while demanding minimum wage of $10 and still cheap prices in ur Walmart or amazon.

China is china stop throwing label around. They have their own circumstances and own law.  
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:12:11
china is still very relevant to bitcoin, majority of miners are still in china. Blockchain techology is still thriving there. guys, China just wanna regulate ICO and cool down bitcoin a bit. Stop imposing bias view on something that could be healthy for the eco system

keep that attitude. and then wonder why youtube and facebook etc are blocked in china. china is your friend if you treat them as friend, china is you enemy if you treat them as enemy. china is just china.

Tell that to German about their nazi sites, tell that to American about Julian Assange and Edward Snowden and wiki leaks.

They can simply mine in china and then sell them in overseas exchanges. It's source of income for china. It would be stupid to shut down the miners as they already invested millions in infrastructure.

This is what I did. I bought a set of metal alphabet stamps from eBay and pickup some scrap aluminum sheet. And hammer the keys into the sheet. Then put it in a safe. No one in the world will know the key except for me and it’s pretty much indestructible.

If you don't wanna feed a dragon to eat us they can do the same my friend. Trade is bilateral and Chinese people aren't stupid.
@_date: 2017-09-17 22:31:46
It is exactly because the difficulty will adjust down due to sudden drop in miners that will cause the security of the Bitcoin network to go down.
