@_date: 2017-12-08 06:41:47
low 200s I think
@_date: 2018-09-10 03:12:59
What happened with that? I'm out of the **loop**

The liquid they are using has a boiling point of 50 degrees celsius, so the hot liquid is vaporised into the chamber above and instantly replaced by more liquid - which i suppose solves the problem with hotspots in the old school mineral oil cooling in the early 2000s late 90s. You probably wont see room temperature numbers but its good to know your upperlimit is about 50 degrees.

Probably because blockchain.info is one of the most popular online wallets.

someone posted a link to the website and i just paraphrased from it + my own watercooling knowledge. looks like they use a two phase system to cool the vapor which condenses back into the liquid pool.

Thanks for the update

Its probably moreso that this is classified as a *convenience* feature rather than *functional*, so it wouldn't belong to the protocol but the application.

did you book it in advance? many banks dont carry much cash for withdrawals on hand. 
@_date: 2019-02-21 06:42:54
They probably ran out on the day for OP
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:50:55
He got 0.1btc in tips. 
@_date: 2019-02-21 04:17:49
Correct a bank branch does not always have much cash on the premises. The money is transferred elsewhere

Facilitated, not run. Big difference 
@_date: 2017-10-31 05:41:07
You are going as the Thai Baht

Hes the "fall guy" because they decided to make an example of Bitcoin market facilitators by giving him an extremely harsh sentence.
@_date: 2017-05-23 00:30:42
I mean as opposed to finding and prosecuting anyone else involved.

Why does it sound like everyone in this subreddit has made hunreds of thousands ? :( 
I have fewer than 10 coins i mined back in 2011. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:15:07
Not hating, just thought you should know its spelt *erratic*.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:22:12
Maybe you are involved with the wrong people?
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:17:19
Only if you get free electricity.
@_date: 2013-11-29 06:19:40
Just now someone sold ~50 coins
