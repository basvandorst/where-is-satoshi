i got lucky and ended up selling at my exit when the price returned there. only to buy back in at a relative low of 320. the good thing about the hype is it boosts the price... the bad thing is... it crashes the servers.

Order was stuck for 38 minutes today. Missed my exit opportunity. now price is way down. Hooray for missing out while doing everything right...

I hate what coinbase/gdax did as much as you all. but how does limiting people from signing in manipulate the price unless they knew what you were going to do before you did it? Not allowing "buy" or "sell" orders by traders is different then limiting access to the exchange.

I'm also stuck, 28 minutes.

Hard fork? To another coin? Didn't we just have that with bitcoin cash?

ha, yes. but overall most people seem bullish. The problem is, i see something like segwit2x, and i wont have the ability to handle my funds and take required actions around the segwit2x fork. maybe it's better to set a sell and re-enter after it settles and i'm out.

yeah, i agree with that. but something like segwit2x isnt the normal "dip" in the curve. but some significant action that now effects the block chain and it's future, as opposed to fear and speculation that normally drive the up/down of the market.

good point. i agree and should move it out to my electrum wallet.

On the capital gains part. If you sell for fiat, but keep the money on the exchange and do not withdraw it to your bank, is it still considered a realized gain? I mean, we are just switching symbols at this point... we can’t even use the money until it’s transferred out.
