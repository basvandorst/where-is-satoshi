Nope, you can have a wallet that is literally on a piece of paper and receive all the bitcoin you want. The only time it needs to be online is if you want to send from your wallet.

Miners cant keep finding coins faster and faster because of the mining difficultly. Basically, the network corrects the difficultly such that on average, coins are produced at a constant rate. More miners wont change that because the difficulty will be adjusted accordingly.

Mining for a profit is not possible anymore unless you spend many thousands on mining equipment. And even then, there is no guarantee that you will make a profit because of the difficulty rising.

Unless you want to spend *thousands* of dollars on equipment, you're not going to make any profit from mining. Mining as a way to learn about bitcoin and how it works is a different story, but there is no profit in mining for the average person.

No because those payment methods (cc and paypall) are reversible while bitcoin is not. Nobody wants to take that risk. You can use your bank with sites like coinbase.com if you are in the US.

P=NP just means there is a polynomial time algorithm for any NP problem. That wouldn't necessarily mean that it would be trivial to solve since the algorithm could be asymptotically Θ(n^1000000000000000) which /is/ P,  but not not really trivial to compute.

Well, 1,180,923,195 is the current difficulty. You can use these charts to have an idea of future difficulty. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:21:46
The difficulty changes in proportion to the hashing power such that on average, a block is found every 10 minutes. This is not the same sort of difficulty as complexity analysis where asymptotic notation describes the difficulty.

Can you elaborate a bit on what you mean? Are you asking if there is a way to make a homemade usb miner? Well, technically sure, but you'd need a pretty good electronics engineering foundation and intimate knowledge of the bitcoin protocol. It is possible to buy asic chips on their own, but you'd need to design an implement your own pcb to use the asic chips. It's not really an easy task and definitely not for everyone. If you really want a usb miner, then pick up a usb block erupter. BUT you really need to understand that you will not make ANY money from mining unless you spend many thousands of dollars on equipment. And even then, there is no guarantee of roi.

Mining for a profit is no longer easily done unless you spend many thousands on mining equipment. You're better off just buying bitcoin because you're not going to make any from mining. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 06:29:49
If you mine, you will be wasting time because you will not get bitcoins that way. Instead, buy some. The difficulty is such that, you have to spend *thousands* of dollars on hardware for mining that more than likely will never break even.

Nope. The "mining" is a very specific operation that has no applicable benefits outside the context of bitcoin, or sha-256 based cryptocurrency. Having hardware that is very fast at hashing does nothing to make computers faster because that hashing power can ONLY be used for calculating hashes.

Please don't be unreasonable. Like I said, they are a small company of EIGHT people working full time. There is no possible way they can personally answer over 400+ support emails A DAY. They are working on hiring new people to answer these emails but as of right now they don't have the time to answer every single one as they come in. They DO answer them, it just takes time. Once they get more staff, these emails should be answered much faster. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:11:27
I completely agree; it would be completely stupid for op to throw money at equipment without understanding how bitcoin fundamentally works, never mind the fact that op is unlikely to see roi.

The limit is hard coded into the protocol and is defined by how often and how much the block reward is reduced. It would be technically possible to increase this limit but it would need to be agreed upon by the entire network. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 08:29:00
Dunno, I've only had positive experiences with coinbase. You have to remember that they're a relatively small company experiencing growing pains right now because of the massive influx of new users registering and buying BTC. As far as I'm aware, they're working hard to hire people for the specific task of answering support tickets. And you have to remember that they are not flagging the transactions themselves; they have an automated system that does that. It might not be perfect yet, but this is another thing they're actively working on. Considering how massive the traffic is that they are experiencing, there will undoubtably be legitimate transactions that are falsely flagged as high risk. I know it is frustrating, but it is unfair to call them a scam. I still recommend them to everyone I know because they are still the easiest way for the average-joe to start buying and using bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:00:09
The transactions are more or less instantaneous, but it is the confirmation for the transaction that takes time. For everyday use this is not a problem since doing a 51% attack on a 10$ purchase makes no sense whatsoever. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 09:21:44


Wtf, why? Just stick to well known services. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:39:03
If/when mass adoption/market stabilization happens, your average transaction won't be in terms of Bitcoin. In fact, you can already see more an more people using mBTC when talking about prices. The idea is the same as having multiple denominations of a currency, like $100, $50, and $20 bills.
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:31:55
Are you planning on trying to make money from mining or doing it as a hobby? Im just curious. I'm not sure of any schematics that exist. But doing it this was would actually end up MORE expensive than buying a pre built miner. The asic chips are not the cheapest and you pretty much have to buy them in bulk which costs lots of money. Also having custom PCBs made is another expensive component. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:31:30
Bitcoin isn't magic free money. If you want to buy a ring, bitcoin isn't inherently more helpful than any other currency. It's like saying, I want to buy a ring, how do I get euros?

The price does not effect the difficulty of mining. Even if it dropped to $1, the difficulty would *only* change relative to the hashing power of the network. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:29:23
Your public address allows you to receive bitcoin.  Your private address is a secret, and should not be shared. It allows you to send bitcoin. There is no limit to the use of an address.

My advice is not to pressure them because it just comes across as annoying. Best thing to do is continue using bitcoin and maybe point out references in the media as bitcoin slowly grows. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 08:36:02
You're not going to make ANY profit from mining unless you spend many thousands of dollars. And even then, it is no guarantee. Best way to get bitcoins is to just buy them. The current difficulty is such that, on an average laptop it would take literally HUNDREDS of years before you find a block solo(not joking). If you join a pool, you're also not going to make any profit because the cost of electricity for running it is more than you get from mining. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:05:08


No. As the hashing power of the network increases, the difficulty adjusts. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:52:28

A bitcoin is currently divisible up to 8 decimal places. You don't have to buy a single bitcoin to own some. You can buy $10 worth or even 10 cents worth. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:23:16
In order to do a double spend, you'd need hashing power of at least half the network. That means you'd need a lot of (expensive) hardware to pull it off. And you're competing with the entire network. For most transactions it would never be worth it because you would need hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of equipment to pull it off. It will be more expensive in the future because the hashing power of the network continues to grow which means you would have to spend exponential amounts of money to keep up with the network.
