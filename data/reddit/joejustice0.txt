The goal for the C3 is $17k USD, or bitcoin! :D I don't know how we'll get it that low- but our backlog is full of tasks to reduce waste and cost to get us there.

So far every investor has declined signing any promissory note with us- they have simply said "when you profit and it is sustainable for the company please repay me with interest." The world is awesome, I never expected this level of altruistic support from the global community.

Team WIKISPEED volunteers run the range from top-class professionals to house-wives and house-husbands, to kids in school working with their parents. We need people to write the song that will make our next YouTube video truly memorable just as much as we need senior material scientists. We need folks curious about CAD to remote-pair with Sr. CAD engineers- which sharpens both of their skills. The average team WIKISPEED member spends 2 to 4 hours a week working with us.

Awesome- thanks for the thumbs up! The real indicator is U.S. EPA fuel efficiency rating- that's the only test that matters for U.S. sales. We are in a queue for the certified testing to get those numbers from the EPA (UDDS/HWFET) and soon after need to do that on the UK, Japanese, EU, and New Zealand cycles. Our numbers are 104 mpg city, 114 mpg highway in SIMULATION of the EPA tests. I desperately want to know our EPA score too. For now we have to say "ultra efficient" and "in simulation of the EPA UDDS/HWFET tests".

For Awesome Open Source stuff, Open Source Ecology  is building a set of the 50 machines they think are required to replicate our current standard of living and society- ALL OPEN SOURCE. totally epic. They have internships to live on their Factor E farm. WIKISPEED has internships too- you can work remote from Florida helping us spec, design, and test the Minivan (it's in the backlog, many folks have asked for it!) or come spend a summer with us living above the shop in Seattle, WA- and help us build it. :D email info :D!!

the top funded crowd funding projects have reward tiers that are the product they are crowd funding- like the Pebble watch/phone accessory. We expected crowd funding the C3 development to not roll in the big funds. If we are successful using the initial crowd funding raised to develop an ultra-inexpensive version of the commuter car, like a $10k flat-packed kit for example, we'll absolutely crowd fund that, and might see more passion and activity in the crowd funding.

We have micro investors at $10 a month (see the right-hand side of  and that's what drives almost all of this. At that level it's too much administrative overhead to authorize stock, so instead we have an agreement that if we make it at recognize profit, we repay them, and if we can afford interest, we repay them with interest. This makes sure we won't laugh all the way to the bank and leave a supporter in the dark. Then we have traditional investment at $10k or bitcoin equivalent and on up. We offer them a promissory letter or convertible debenture- standard Angel investment documentation. What we do though is investors never retain the right to liquidate the company and keep IP, this protects us from what happened to Aptera. email info to rock with us.

To get to 100 mpg, we did Test Driven Development. We started with software to automate/simulate the EPA city (UDDS) and highway (HWFET) driving cycle to get what the EPA got when we entered in the data for cars currently sold. Then, using exploratory testing the algorithm returned the cloud of parameters that could achieve 100 mpg. Then a human analyzed those "possible" parameters to determine which were inexpensive and/or less complex. What we ended up doing was reducing the weight to a bit less than half the weight of a Prius without compromising safety. Pre-X Prize, about half our engineering time went to iterating lighter and lighter safety structures. Then, we have about half the aerodynamic drag of a Prius. That's mostly through simply reducing the frontal area- most of the car is 2' tall. Then, we optimized the BSFC (Brake Specific Fuel Consumption) of the engine- per gram of fuel that goes in how many Killowatt hours come out. We pre-heat our fuel, modify our injection- essentially all types of little tweaks that each give 1% gain- but in aggregate give us another 20% fuel economy boost. Some of what we came up with was novel, and the one part of the car we've provisionally patented is a part of our fuel economy tech.
@_date: 2012-08-01 17:23:07
There's a lot worth covering in your post. I'll start with safety. We've done offset frontal impact testing and side impact testing with a credentialed crash testing facility (CAPE:  and it's about $10k for each test, + the cost of the car, + the cost to get the car there, +the cost to retrieve or recycle the crashed car. We found our seat mounts were terrible and our frontal crush structure was excellent, and our side structure was passable but we could do better. so we updated our seat mounts and iterated our side crush structure. With the funds we've raised on indiegogo ( we're jazzed to repeat crash testing- our priority is testing a chassis with lowered side sills to allow traditional doors.

wiki-wiki is the Hawaiian word for "quickly". So Wikipedia is "fast-pedia". So we are "speed-speed". :) I liked the association the word "wiki" has with hi-tech, collaboration, and knowledge work- that's exactly the type of team I was hoping to work with.
@_date: 2012-08-01 18:17:17
for boosting BSFC, reducing aero drag, and reducing weight without compromising safety, there are some really clever folks doing it to their personal cars here:  Some of these folks even post fairly scientific before and after tests.

I did a google image search for "awesome high five". :D Later, someone found the artist who did most of that image ( and we got in touch- and he made an even more awesome high five just for us! Look for it at Agile2012 this year ( when we do the closing keynote!

I was stressed we weren't trending to afford even one $10,000 crash test. But then the Shuttleworth foundation sent us a $5,000 grant- and then we received some mailed in checks for another $1,500. Those inputs didn't update the indiegogo crowd funding thermometer ( but in all we generated enough funds to do our next round of crash testing! It would have been awesome to be better funded, but I'm glad we got enough to get us to the next level of our comfy commuter car project.

oh and royalties- not if you built from the open source plans- they are open source- so whatever you built from that is yours. If you would like the cars you build to be sold through WIKISPEED, and carry a WIKISPEED warranty, you would pay us to test your products to verify we can warranty them, and then we'd warranty and sell them for you in exchange for keeping a % fee (as soon as someone engages with us in that model we'll figure out, standardize, and publish what the % is). But if you want to make them under your own brand- you don't need to send us anything. We'd request you publish enhancements in Open Source or send them to us so all the products can get better, but that's just a request.

We've received 13 bitcoins (&gt;$100!) as donations, THANKS BITCOIN COMMUNITY! I am very excited for our first bitcoin purchase- when that happens we will post on our website, likely also announce it in bitcoin magazine, and a press release saying we've sold the first car built by a collaborative community in exchange for a currency issued by no bank.

We're a lean start-up using Agile methodology (and lots of supporting practices you can see me nerd out about on  like XP, XM, Scrum, TDD, TDM, etc) and those all drive down our costs and decrease our timelines. We just replicated the WIKISPEED method, in July, at Tait Radio in New Zealand. Their hardware engineering team whent from a concept to a working prototype in a customer's hands in 5 days- that would usually take 3 months. So $10 to us, or 1 bitcoin, gets us what $100,000.00 or more gets folks using traditional manufacturing and project management methods.

Every factor matters, but three matter much more than anything else. Weight, Aerodynamic Drag, and the efficiency of the engine itself. We spent about half our engineering time developing light weight safety structures and are now a little less than half the weight of a Prius. Aero was more simple- we reduced frontal area- most of the front of the car is 2' tall. Efficiency- we bought the most efficient (BSFC) engine currently available in mass quantities and with a 36k mile warranty, the Honda R18A. It's a 1.8 liter inline 4 straight gasoline engine, and more efficient than the gasoline side of the Toyota Prius power train. We then tried every little scam we'd heard of and thought of to boost efficiency, like pre-heating the fuel and modified injection patterns and cycles. We found many of these worked just a little bit- giving tiny gains- and all of them together gave us another ~20% fuel efficiency (BSFC). The one innovation we applied for a provisional patent on is something we tried that worked well in this area, and all the rest we put into the public domain so people all over the world can help us build on that.

I'm totally jazzed for the C3 (Comfy Commuter Car) ( too! Our prototypes are rough-and-tumble. To get to the C3 we need hundreds of hours of FEA (finite element analysis) to simulate stresses and impacats on different ultra-light chassis with doors. Our SGT01 prototypes that we sell now require you to step over the sides and sit down in like a real race-car- great for light weight with side impact protection but impractical for many types of commuters. To evolve past that, we need a lot of FEA time. Send FEA grad students are way! (email info

The goal of the modularity- that the car is made of 8 interchangeable parts- is that folks can modify or evolve their car. We've posted CAD of one version of all 8 assemblies in Open Source to help folks modify or design their own. We warranty modules we make, and will test modules other people make for a nominal cost if they want us to. If modules someone else makes pass our tests, we can offer our warranty on those and sell them through our store in exchange for a % of sales. So modifying modules or inventing your own can be a revenue stream for you and us too.

I'll clarify, although we met the Aptera original engineers and their VC, I wasn't in the Aptera or VC firm board room during the events above. This is my take, from what I observed in the news and from team Aptera themselves. Those original engineers are probably the best to ask, but are likely legally bound by a gag-order with further financial penalties if they speak about certain parts of the business deal. I'm so glad we've open-sourced a version of our car to the public domain- no matter what silly contract we sign that will always be out there. It's like an insurance policy that the project has produced something the world can choose to use.
@_date: 2012-08-01 17:34:19
Yes. we have two prototypes with license plates on them and insured through Progressive and we've gotten quotes from USAA and Gieco. We drive them around just like normal cars. We are building two cars for customers now, that they will drive around just like ordinary cars, but about twice the efficiency of a Prius, and quite a bit faster too when they do decide to put the pedal down to the floor. :D!!

We published a version of our car in Open Source ( so folks can modify or design their own compatible modules. All designs done as part of team WIKISPEED (email info to get hands on with us!) are retained by whoever did the work, WIKISPEED only requires that WIKISPEED can also use those designs in perpetuity for free. Other than that, the designer can choose to open source the design, lease it, sell it, etc. So far, almost every team member has decided to put their work with WIKISPEED directly into the public domain.

The 2 seat interior module would fit two of you, but the 4 seat interior module wouldn't work. I'm 6'2 and 210lbs, and we can fit 4 folks my size in the 4 seat interior module without touching each other. We aren't all sprawled out- but we aren't touching. at 6'11, the 2 seat version would be our only interior module version for you. We are talking about a "tall boy" body and interior module combo, which would allow 4 of you, but that's lower on the priority queue since we don't have a buyer in-line for it yet. Email us if we should up its priority. :D!

The goals for the C3 are to be a similar, or lower, total cost of ownership than existing economy commuter vehicles, with similar levels of comfort and convenience, and double or more the fuel efficiency and corresponding emissions reduction. It will be available as soon as the backlog of C3 tasks all move to done- and that speeds up with more materials, machinery, and person hours. Right now we are blocked needing more simulated stress testing (FEA) on our chassis designs.

One block is that PayPal provides buttons that take the user off the page to pay, where they use HTTPS to add a basic layer of security to the transaction. With Bitcoin, we haven't seen a company or provider offer that yet- meaning we have to buy an SSL cert for our checkout page for Bitcoin but we don't for PayPal. So it's not as simple yet.

We'd like to get a version at a ridiculously affordable price, like $10k. For that it might be a flat-packed kit, Ikea style. The goal there would be to try to design the car so that it can be built in a rented parking space in front of an apartment building in just a few hours- while paying the street parking meter. If we hit that goal we'll absolutely put it on kickstarter- whose maximum reward tier is as the $10k level.

Aptera took Venture Capital, a few million dollars worth, in exchange for the VC firm having the right to cancel the project and retain all rights and IP if they got cold feet. These terms are common from VC. While we were in the X Prize with them, the VC firm fired the original team of engineers (7 of them I believe) and by contract those engineers are forbidden to work on anything related to the Aptera project or its technology ever again. The original engineers had personal loans that in aggregate were over a million dollars in order to produce the first working prototypes that attracted the VC in the first place, and now those engineers had no job- no way to continue working on their passion and area of expertise, and still had these massive personal loans. the only group that was paid were the VC, which then liquidated the assets of the company ( Many revolutionary companies are looking for VC to help them "make it big" or otherwise take outside debt and then struggle with the reports, predictions, and process imposed on them by the larger non-innovative firm until they are smothered and go under, or are simply liquidated outright for short term gains that seem to make sense to the larger firm who is using cost-accounting. WIKISPEED has no debt- even if we don' sell another car for another 3 years we will be here, innovating and iterating our products.
