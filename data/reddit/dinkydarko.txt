It reflects badly on the community that it's so split.

I unsubscribed when I saw how this sub was being run, and only check back rarely. The moderation here has actually put me off bitcoin to a degree. Maybe there are others who feel the same.

Would be interested?

Honestly, I don't subscribe. I was on a train home to visit family (who 2 years ago I gifted them ~0.1 btc) and I was looking through lots of subs I don't subscribe to.         
My comment was initially down voted, along with few previous posts/comments.

Legal tender doesn't usually mean stores would have to accept it. In not 100% on the us law, but I think it usually means you would be able to use it to settle an existing debt. Like in a restaurant where you have ordered and eaten, then pay.     
I still see that as being unlikely at the moment.

Could try the transaction accelerator?
