While I grant you that the OP may not be on the level about their position, I don’t see anything in their post to indicate they don’t have a decent grasp of the basics. Truth be told I have been wondering similar over the last few weeks.
ASIC designs don’t have to be anywhere near optimised in order to dramatically outperform general purpose chips. Even though in terms of raw engineering technology AMD, Intel and nVidia are way more advanced, the sheer inefficiency of using general purpose designs for hashing makes massive gains for custom chips. Question is how much could theoretically be gained?
There are two factors to try optimising against. The first is speed, which is obvious enough. It would be interesting to see where, from a circuitry perspective, ASICs are with this. I suspect that most ASIC designs being manufactured use modifications to commercially available chips rather than being composed of chips designed from the ground up. If this suspicion is true then there could much larger speed gains to be had.
The second factor is power consumption, and here I am wondering if there are major gains to be had. Energy is really lost when bit states are wiped through grounding. Most chips, being primarily designed for speed, do this. But it should be possible, at least in theory, to recycle some of that energy back into circuitry. If you designed an ASIC chip with this in mind you will likely suffer a drop in speed, but if you get good enough savings in power consumption it may be well worth it. This could be even more so when you consider that almost all commercially available chip designs aren’t really designed with this in mind.
Of course, going from a raw design to functioning silicone involves lots of very expensive steps and contracting – but it is interesting to think about.
