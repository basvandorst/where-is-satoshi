Not just skeptics. Nearly everyone was saying it was a bubble
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:22:57
How about the fact that everyone knew it was coming. Everyone.
Not people saying it's a scam, but ardent supporters. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:24:03
Naw. You really think there will be any trust in another cryptocurrency?

@_date: 2017-12-22 08:49:53
Why the rise in the first place? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:16:21
I'm sorry, I'm sure this has been asked/noted: but haven't we had OKCoin and BitMEX futures already? Is it that they settle in BTC rather than USD?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:10:34
Really tough call, but you only live so many years on this Earth.
As far as we know,
I hope it blasts to the moon of all moons for all of you.

No. 38k still puts you in the 15% long term cap gains bracket. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:00:57
lol indeed.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:43:47

You could buy presents that reflect the people in your life and their interests rather than money.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:04:03
Oh sorry!  Thought you were talking about the 15% capital gains tax. You are correct, sir 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:23:14
Health insurance from your job isn't automatically a panacea for every illness or disease you might get. People act like it's automatically the best healthcare out there, when in fact, they vary as much as plans on the indiv. market.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:52:13
I don't get it either. I've had no problems. Bread Wallet. 100 bucks USD, sent to another address of mine on a hardware wallet. Asked me for the quick or cheap option. I took cheap and it was still confirmed within an hour.

They also do it in during Election Day or special elections and also have "mega threads" when something big goes down that everyone will be posting about. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 01:18:16
We don't know.
We really don't.

@_date: 2017-11-08 19:14:28
Free Markets are beyond reproach?

Definitely the same...
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:30:50
Naw Bitcoin's on the pill now. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:18:19


and then, two paragraphs away:


So copyrights deserve to be irrefutable and decentralized, but not money itself. 


Except there is case after case after case of Prof Bitcorns claiming it's fake and asking what we're smoking.  Well a good number are smoking high quality pot, but that's besides the point.

I don't think teenagers need to be concerned with opening an IRA.
You should be enjoying life, thinking about your education and or job, doing something competitive, and setting yourself up for a good adulthood. 
If you've got some money to spare, go ahead and invest it in Bitcoin, no one knows where it is headed, though. 
You better be willing to lose it all or to see a significant part of your holdings dissipate in hours. The other side is that it can come back in minutes and gain tons of value. 
Of course learning about bitcoin is great too, but no one knows if it is too late to make money off it or not. If we knew that, we'd be buying or selling like crazy. Maybe some are.

I'm with you, but just not quite as early.  But I agree it's good to start earlier than you'd normally think.
