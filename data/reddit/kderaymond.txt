It's the coding equivalent to a fork in the road.

Good reason to use a fork if anything. Screw your walled garden.

It's not just principle, it has everything to do with profit. What's good for you short term is bad for BTC long term and can make your stake in BTC worthless.

Tor was a government project. Not disagreeing with you, just pointing it out.

While you are correct, the majority of Bitcoin transactions are legitimate. There was a very easy test for this, which we passed with flying colors: the closure of silk road. The fact that the price of Bitcoin didn't tank that day tells us that most transactions are indeed legitimate.

Fuck Facebook. This is also exact reason I use adblock for, not that I would fall for something like this anyway.

Just ordered something for my wife, she loves hemp products so I'm sure she'll be happy! 
Love using my coins. :D

Yes, a car guaranteed to lose value. 
Neither are terribly good investments of all your available credit.

Bitcoin is fueled by speculation and emotional trading so I tend to stay away during high volume. Also China. I'm sure you don't need me to answer your question, but have a look at the charts.

The problem with any pool having a majority of the hashing power is when they do get DDoS'd it opens up the entire network to attack. Regardless of the pools intentions, by having a large majority of users (even 20%) is bad for the network as a whole.

I saw similar posts on some more mainstream media articles about Bitcoin. Probably followed us back here, haha.

You can apply your logic to any fiat currency. People with money will always have more opportunities to make more money.

Very interesting read, thank you!

BTC is exactly like cash. As you said, you can file a police report if cash was stolen from you, the same rule applies to BTC. Are you going to get either back? Probably not, but in effect they are the same. 
Would you put your cash into a safe that you did not understand how to operate and open properly? It's the same as using random applications to manage your BTC. 
Don't think I don't understand where you are coming from, Bitcoin in it's current state will scare even tech savvy people, but as time goes on people will learn. We have a lot of tenacious developers out there trying to solve problems such as this, given time I think we'll have good solutions to all of these problems.
