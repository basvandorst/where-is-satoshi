Sorry, re-posting here for visibility (I'm late to the party):
Hi, alerted me to the presence of this post. I have made something that is not for profit and tries to serve as a place where interested parties can leave reviews on research relating to cryptocurrencies. Please let me know what you think.
@_date: 2014-10-22 19:03:06
I get that and ordinarily agree with you. This is more of a site that aggregates research articles than is purely discussion so it's easier for people to find opinions on the research down the road so I thought it was more appropriately. But, I can see how it might appear at first glance.
@_date: 2014-08-28 15:56:34
Did you write this? Would you like to post it on  and ask people to review it there?
We are actually lacking reviews on other material, so if there is anything that interests you greatly, could you write a review or a layperson's summary of it for us?
@_date: 2014-10-22 18:08:10
Ok, this is what someone else pm'ed me too. Can you explain how this works so that I can try and not do it again? What exactly is blog spam?
@_date: 2014-10-13 13:57:58
Thanks for this! I will let people know about it at these places.
EDIT: sent a mail to the dev list... thanks... let's hope I don't get too many angry replies back :)
@_date: 2014-10-13 13:36:14
Hey, maybe you could consider linking to this from  ... more people might find it there once it becomes lost on reddit.

Circle doesn't need to Peter Todd in the same way Peter Todd doesn't need to respond to me when I was asking his opinion of my research platform: 
@_date: 2014-10-22 17:09:50
Why is my comment being down voted? Is there something wrong with what I'm trying to do?
EDIT: great, spend hours trying to create something good for Bitcoin etc... let me go and slit my throat. No really, I'm paying $20 a month to keep this site going... if there is something fundamentally wrong with it I would like to know... don't just down vote me.
@_date: 2014-08-12 16:25:06
As per some requests, I've changed the name from opencryptoreview since crypto refers to cryptography. I've had a few people upload their research. What it's lacking is some feedback on this research.
@_date: 2014-10-22 18:59:27
Searching StackOverflow doesn't give me an ordered list of research papers I can look through. This is a bad example. It's not remotely similar. Can you list the others for me so I can go and check them out and decide whether it's worth my time to continue to maintain this site or if I should just give it up and put the money I'm paying on hosting into buying bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-10-23 10:08:01
Wow, I didn't know this would incur so much hatred. I am just trying to make something useful.

I understand "network effect". That's why I have myself some bitcoins. My site is not trying to be the reddit of cryptocurrencies. Not in the slightest. It's a place where relevant research can aggregate so that people can find it easily. Do you think people will be able to see comments on the sidechains paper in two days time here? 
@_date: 2014-10-13 13:37:09
Ok, so 0.3 BTC... I'm not sure I can afford that... do you know any ways I can get the other 0.2?
@_date: 2014-09-13 22:32:38
Please feel free to link to this from my site:   I'm hoping that feedback there in the form of reviews doesn't get lost over time.
@_date: 2014-12-15 02:19:33
what do you mean click bait?
@_date: 2014-10-12 00:39:47
1 hour, 2 upvotes... I guess people aren't really that interested in the core research underlying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Maybe I'm bad at advertising... any suggestions?
@_date: 2014-10-22 16:49:45
Please feel free to discuss it here as well as on reddit: 
Why? Why not just here on this thread?
I'm hoping that thought out commentary on this type of innovative research is more easily found in future on this repository than being hidden (after some time) here on reddit and that this becomes a comprehensive repo for cryptocurrency related research.
Please feel free to add other research that you are interested in or provide some discussion on the existing material.
@_date: 2014-10-22 19:38:23
Yeah, the hivemind makes the rules, but they are hard to see upfront. Thanks for the explanation.
@_date: 2014-10-12 14:27:35
What do you think is an attractive offer?
@_date: 2014-09-05 22:00:07
If anyone wants to write a review on this book (or even just highlight the parts they found most valuable), you can do it here: 
Here is another book that he's posted here for comment:

sorry, give it another go! :D I was just busy creating a great site.
@_date: 2014-10-13 13:46:15
this seems like the most plausible answer... miners need money right now and don't want to drop the price by selling on exchanges.
@_date: 2014-10-22 23:03:03
You've still not listed the others that you said existed. Just your favorite one or two will do for me to look into. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-07-16 19:27:59
Thanks a lot. That would be great. Once some content is there it will be easier to others to follow. There might be some 'I don't want to review or comment first going on' :)
@_date: 2014-10-22 17:33:39
I got down voted to hell for asking people to try my platform on another thread. Maybe people are anti-hijacking. That was not my intention.
I made this site so that relevant comments about cryptocurrency related research wouldn't be lost. Searching for enlightening comments about this research is hard to do on bitcointalk and on reddit. I'm hoping that the same is not true for OpenCryptocurrencyReview.
If you are going to down vote this post, please do so, but please also let me know why I've wasted my time here. I'm still unsure about whether OpenCryptocurrencyReview has any long term use value, but some time ago I wanted to browse all cryptocurrency related articles and get opinion on them at the same time and I couldn't find a place to do it. So I made one.
@_date: 2014-12-15 01:11:07
Hi, I created 
I'm trying to write up my PhD (non-bitcoin related) so I can't devote much time to uploading articles although I have already uploaded a few. I wouldn't mind someone helping me out with the site (if they think that it's useful). Uploading interesting articles and directing people to discuss their views there.
The main point is so that discussions on research can be found in one place.
It's mainly lacking content, so any way of generating some initial content would be extremely helpful.
I tried offering some small BTC prize for the best layperson review, but I only got 1 entry. I'm not made of money so I can't offer much more.
@_date: 2014-10-22 18:13:46
I should add that even if you don't have any praise of criticisms of the paper, just writing a layperson summary for it so others can understand what's going on without have to read the full paper would be immensely useful (if you have the time and interest). 
@_date: 2014-10-13 21:31:16
Sounds like a plan... let me go and grow them.

As per some requests, I've changed the name from opencryptoreview since crypto refers to cryptography. I've had a few people upload their research. What it's lacking is some feedback on this research.
It's not only for researcher to give feedback but also for laypeople if they are interested enough and the feedback is well structured.
I'm hoping that given enough use, it becomes a good repository for finding cryptocurrency research through the use of the tagging system.
I'm re-posting this because the new domain name didn't propagate enough in my last posting.
@_date: 2014-10-13 13:50:10
Oh, I didn't see that. Can you link me to it? I've had this out for about 2 or 3 months.
Thanks for the compliment. It's not seeing much use just yet but it still acts as a reasonable repo for research docs relating to cryptocurrency. Is the effort to link to a document too great? Let me know if you have any criticisms even though I don't have time to fix things now I might do at some point. 
@_date: 2014-11-01 20:15:25
I'm running a competition on my site for the best layperson summary of the sidechains paper. I've got one entry so far... maybe it helps you: 
@_date: 2014-10-22 17:51:50
I'm hoping that someone can write a good lay person summary of it and stick it here: 
@_date: 2014-10-22 20:08:27
I thought about that, but would that be appreciated by the people posting the ideas (even if I attribute the comments to them)? I was a little concerned about doing that.
Thanks for the suggestion though, I might give it a go.
I've also, today, advertised a competition inside the Cambridge University Cryptographic Currency Society (about 100 people). I initially posted this competition to reddit but it seemed that few were interested: 
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:07:55
Is there another place to very quickly see all crypto related research?
Thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2014-10-22 23:25:32
I see. Ok, thanks for your input. It's not a product. It's a platform that aggregates research in this space. I'm not trying to monetize it.
@_date: 2014-08-12 14:51:40
Haha, thanks for getting back :) I've changed the name to 
@_date: 2014-08-12 17:43:00
It's probably the DNS propagation. Works for me... probably should have left some time before posting... will post again later then for visibility. 
@_date: 2014-10-11 17:14:08
Hi, please feel free to link to your pdf and copy your abstract to  and ask people to leave a review of your work there. It should be easier to find there in a year from now as opposed to within the depths of reddit.
Please feel free to review some of the other papers, even if it's only a lay person summary. Anything will help.
@_date: 2015-01-17 18:53:03
thanks.
