It is exactly that. Our governor general technically doesn't have to listen to who the Prime Minister suggests for senators, but traditionally always does. 
Though, more than one of the popular parties for the federal election this fall has pledged to abolish the Senate.

Can this split ever be further expanded if necessary?
@_date: 2014-07-12 08:53:35
Cool. I'll try this if it still works in August! 
@_date: 2014-11-13 13:15:07
Foot meet mouth. Thanks for the correction!

Many services have an optional subscription that removes all advertisements. Is that the sort of thing you mean?

The same parent company owns both Brazzers and Pornhub. So...

Yep - unless prohibited by law in that country (recently changed in Canada to be illegal to have gift card balance deteriorate/expire).

That's why I get all my rub downs at Chinese shops only and go all in on their suggestions. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 18:36:49
Most basic explanation here. It's not the sale that affects market price. It's the availability of offers in the first place. 
You have more people selling and less appetite to buy? Price trends downwards until they equalize. 
More people buying and less availability? Price trends upwards until they equalize. 
The individual transaction is unrelated to the market price except for the fact that if you're buying or selling way off from the market price nobody will make the transaction with you. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 19:55:35
Yeah, fair, but it's a reasonable simplification for their question. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:22:51
And what of ETH? 
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:01:58
Yes they do. Some people spend poorly. It is why banks sell cards which send a small amount of money from checking to savings accounts on every transaction. With bitcoin, this would also be likely worth more in the future than present.

But you're speaking as an investor. Moreover, as an informed investor that can trust yourself to make financially beneficial choices. Many people know damn well they aren't informed, and take locked up options without extra premiums for that very reason. With a deflationary currency, they are doing slightly better than before. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 15:17:55
~~paranoid~~ correctly prepared about stuff like this. 
Those digital rights advocates have a lot going for them. It's about things like this, not merely "hurr durr pirates". I'm glad that at least some groups have more secure practices.

Bummer. All my city has is one bakery and two ATMs inside pizza places. Nobody else :(.

But I do think monopolies are good in cases where service is not profitable but is necessary or humane. Really any scenario where it is a loss for an individual company to act but is a net win for society to act. 
For example, the healthcare in my area is completely 'monopoly covered'. The caveat is that this monopoly group is the sum of all consumers, acting together for a mutually beneficial arrangement, controlled through public opinion. 
I suppose one could argue these arrangements would take place without government. Groups could arise to arrive at the same end. But then wouldn't it just be government by a different name? 
I feel I need much more study to fully understand.

A bank can loan the same money multiple times, as they receive it in deposits multiple times.
Example, with poo and zippity : 
Bank A loans you a hundred dollars. You spend this money to buy a hundred mars bars from me. I then take your hundred dollars, which you still owe to the bank, and deposit it. They can loan out this money again. So they have total amount of a hundred now sitting in two hundred dollars worth of loans. 
Deposits equal loans, but need not be paid before money is loaned again. So if the bank loans out the hundred, and then you decide you cannot pay the loan, there is trouble, but I want to withdraw my deposit - trouble. That is why we have some legal restrictions on the extent to which this can be done. 
In reality there are many banks, bank must keep a portion of money in reserve, and interest rates factor in to create more money. So it's more complicated but you get the gist.

How much of the total BTC in existence are controlled by these 'Whale' investors though?
@_date: 2013-07-03 08:31:58
Shorthand for primary (1 degree) and secondary (2 degree), etc in some crowds.
@_date: 2013-11-12 21:51:44
Wait. How *will* they be rewarded? We're already at the break even point for profit right? 
More reading I need to do...
@_date: 2013-11-12 20:58:54
Yeah, unfortunately I realize that. The thing is - I'm a student. I have significant credit available but it is just that, credit. It's probably irresponsible in general to go anywhere beyond my current goal of "take about $150 and use it as BTC to support businesses and services around here". 
I'll probably just miss out on the exponential growth, but I'm protected from any bubble effect.
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:46:34
That's... brilliant. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 22:43:58
And that's not even mentioning all the nations that use the American Dollar because of hyperinflation. There is almost zero regulatory barrier in those places. 
@_date: 2013-07-16 22:47:24
I suppose it is possible. Perhaps I am just more pessimistic about human nature then. I do feel allowing normal exchange for topics such as police, nation defense, fire service, health, public infrastructure, social workers, etc would really leave some people out of luck since these are not all inherently profitable but are necessary for normal functioning of society.

Wow! Thank you! 
Now I get to figure out how this tip bot works! 
@_date: 2013-10-30 08:37:29
That's like $20? I need to spend more time here. And figure out wtf I can do with bitcoins... I don't think I can mine but maybe I could buy some... 
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:02:39
That's amazing. To the risky investor (arguably wise investor) go the spoils, eh. 
So how do you pay for these things in bitcoin? I was under the impression it was not widely accepted yet. I've found it only a few places, like reddit or humble bundle. Is there a transfer to local currency option somehow? 
Also, how do you physically pay? Is it some sort of transfer with a phone or card? Do you just send them to a wallet and the owner says "yes I got them" in front of you? 
Damned rabbit holes... 
@_date: 2013-07-16 21:22:41
How is that? Would you prefer they charge you for access? 
@_date: 2013-11-10 18:40:35
Cavirtex looks perfect. Thanks! 
@_date: 2013-07-16 21:14:52
Necessary theft, if we want government services.
@_date: 2013-11-10 18:18:28
Oh, and lastly, is there anything wrong with the "My Wallet" service at  ?
@_date: 2013-11-13 02:59:53
So... it is it's own market and should balance itself over time. Transactions paying more would be done the quickest, and while paying nothing wouldn't be done. 
Neat. 
@_date: 2013-06-01 07:32:15
I was thinking more like for artists who come to their comment sections in music threads. Or fine folks who just help, like in . Might have to make me a bitcoin wallet now! 
@_date: 2013-11-18 05:44:34
But a thousand? It doesn't have that sort of real life usage. Feels like a derivative market.

Not American but I am very interested! Thank you for the book recommendation, I appreciate it. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 22:07:50
But who decides the fee? How is it awarded and who receives it? 
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:56:54
What happens when those twins start selling? How much do investors control?
@_date: 2013-11-12 20:50:14
Followup is that I signed up with Cavirtex and am now trying to sift through mountains of information on exactly what price I want to buy at. I've been convinced the current BTC value is a bit high for it's utility - but that might be wrong.
@_date: 2013-11-12 21:18:35
That's good advice. I worry some in this sub get risky!
