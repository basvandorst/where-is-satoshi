I find it interesting that they have a policy against this, and also gambling.
I see a lot of questionable advertising in my newsfeed masquerading as something else. Quite often it will be a click bait title about something perceived to be controversial and quickly pivot into a story about how some house wife made a boat load of money gambling on a web page. Isn’t online gambling illegal in the US anyway?

Predictions for Dec 2018? For me BTC 100k, ETH 7K and EOS 200 dollars. That would do nicely!

Exchanges are the new central banks. Driven by greed. They want your USD, that is the goal.

Hello BTC fans, the chart does not look positive. The 2 hrs chart shows a HS and a significant changing cross at 17.850. So we maybe have to stand a next dip down to 9000 around. I do not like this, cause have also BTC in my portfolio. But the signs are not really positive. But, should this dip really come true the next hrs and we have to test again 9000 or maybe 8000, than it might rise again healthier. HT NL said this a few days ago. Okay, lets all stay tough.
Its just my opinion, might be completly wrong, so lets see

not every single new is FUD or negative but just now crypto world is full of scammer and bad stories start floating out of the deep and that affect the whole market ..one real fact though..getting rich over night or to the moon is over..things will go slowly because people are more conservative now and a lot of recent newcomer are in red and lose.so too much panic too..you can say it is all mess now
