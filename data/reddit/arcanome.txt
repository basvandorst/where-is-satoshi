Not quite sure about it. 
If bitcoin is going to be a currency, then it is fair to say that Warren Buffet is competent enough.
If bitcoin is going to be movable commodity, then Warren Buffet is competent enough.
If bitcoin is valuable because of the technology behind it, per se if it fails to either be a commodity or currency, then bitcoin will crash anyway (technology will be adopted in other ways).
Also Im pretty sure that you dont need to understand blockchain technicalities to evaluate bitcoin. Just as you dont have to understand bitcoin to make transactions or buy/sell it.

Im also starting up a restaurant and highly interested into this topic. Yet I have doubts about practicality of bitcoin at physical exchange at this very moment. For example im trying to form safe wallet for last 2 days and I experienced multiple errors. Learning curve looks imense. Howr can one overcome this with bitcoin especially considering not everyone is "smart" let alone being pc geek

it can never compete against bitcoin. The reason is that because it is "APPLE" branded. Why would any competitioner of Apple allow the use of iWallet at any of their products? Considering how many enemies apple has, and how small their "iwallet" brings compared to bitcoin... It has no privacy (the same apple we talk about? that shares private infos with govt?), no trust...

Yeah I dont think of using coinbase. just gonna use bitstamp / armory / a local turkish website and paper wallets. Also gonna use mycelium to transfer coins between paper wallets and armory I believe.

what is bitstamp and why bitstamp? also If I invest on bitcoin from X site em I allowed to transfer to another site? For example I invest my Turkish lira into bitcoin via a turkish btc site, can I sell it at another website for dollar?
@_date: 2014-01-26 13:20:12
Yes definetly good advice. I'm gonna purchase 100$worth of bitcoin tommorow from said website. Move them to my wallet and then to bitstamp. Get identifaction approved at bitstamp and try to get payment to my bank account directly from there. So in case of emergency I will have the gateway out. See how it goes and stuff...
Also I'm currently downloading all base of Armory. It says that I can create a paper wallet without printing. What em I supposed to do for that?

Credit card fees are way more then 2% in long term i believe. Yearly fees etc...
@_date: 2014-01-26 20:09:52
No credit card company can ever guarantee you protection from dollar volatility. They both have the same risk considering volitality. The more volatile a curreny is, the more it has chance to make you profit ALOT. You wont ever win thousand of "buying power" only investing into euro, dollar, unless there is a global crises or something.
In the other hand bitcoin can assure there is no fraudulence since there is MILLIONS copies of transactions EVER MADE with bitcoin. You only need to protect your private code. On the other hand your bank accounts are only saved by the bank itself, and a sheet that is given to you. You have every right to get your money from a bank as long as you keep the sheet, yet you have no right to charge if a bank goes bankrupt. Millions of people lost money at 2001 crises in Turkey because some banks declared bankrupcy.
Other benefits are that bitcoin is not under control of any bank so you dont have to go to A bank and make em send your X money to B bank for delivering to Z client. With bitcoin you can just click few buttons and your bitcoin will go to Z client without any middleman involved. No delays no percantage comission...

I hope it is a house with a small top floor room. 
First you will need abyss black carpet for your hall and stairs which is leading to the roof. It must be real dark.
You will need to paint the hall leading to the stairs with dark color it doesnt really matter.
This will be the hardest part probably, you will lots of leds. Leds in shape if "b for bitcoin" but they have to be really small and orange / bright whitish yellow. You will put those to the walls. If you make em small enough they wont look too bad at daylight. You can even put just few b's spread around small dot leds. Its okay. Dont forget to put em on the carpet!! Requires lots of wiring but worth it.
Stairs must be shaped as such that, your vision will be obstructed by a small board right before putting your head to upstairs. Hard to explain but you got the idea. Someone who goes upstairs must not see the room but the board first.
It will ofcourse write "to the moon!!" At the board. With leds.
Rooms walls will be completly window. COMPLETLY. There will be no object but only a telescope and a soft rug which you can lay on.
You can place leds on the glass but i rather not. It will take the focus off from stars and moon if you put the leds.
It will be a great emotional symbolic room. You will always remember how you reached to the moon. You will always remember how important it is to have dreams. Have sight and imagination. 
Also your wife can like it. Its deeply romantic idea.

Well I'm not gonna invest all of my money into anything. I did sell a real estate worth of 300k$ few months ago and currently have lira at my hand. I'm opening up a restaurant with some of it and wanna play the game with reasonable amount of it. In this case around 20,000. 
I dont specificly trust the strength of USD, I just dont trust to the strength of Lira. Thats why I'm looking for alternatives. Bitcoin is a risky yet can be well awarding alternative. And I've mentioned it somewhere around here where it is possible to circulate lira &gt; bitcoin &gt; dollar &gt; lira and profit around 5% weekly at current rates, including website fees and wire costs. Yet I dont have the cash nor the guts to play that with something I have no idea about. So I'm planning to try it with 0,5-1Btc and see how it goes. Second method can be just throwing 5-10BTC worth of liras into bitcoin and see what happens in long term, as many of you guys do..
@_date: 2014-01-26 15:29:48
Can you inform me about that time table of transactions? I've searched and found that the site I'm going to buy BTC with TL is pretty swift with delivery within 30minutes after transfer.
How long does it take for one to move BTC from web account into his wallet? Or vice versa.
Then again how long does it take for bitstamp to convert your BTC to $? isnt that instant?
Last whats the procedure of withdrawing cash from sites like bitstamp? I guess you have to withdraw from an international bank like HSBC right? how long does it take?
@_date: 2014-01-28 10:48:24
Well I live in Turkey and bitcoin is not a known thing for most. Even for most educated-internet consuming people. So the problem with bitcoin in my case is that if Im going to start accepting bitcoin, I also have to educate the consumer, not only my staff. Its not something thats gonna happen in a day but for shops like restaurants etc, a differentiating quality is big plus. So yeah even if people dont know about or use bitcoin saying "this restaurant accepts bitcoin' is a huge marketing move. Because a year later when bitcoin goes wider in my community everybody will say "oh yeah that restaurant has been accepting bitcoin since last year!"

Everyone is missing the point of numbers. Math is all about numbers so is politics. You can have unlimited power but you can not fight against numbers. When your 30 million citizens (thats very little yet effectful) use and want to continue using bitcoin, you will have to destroy them to destroy bitcoin. 
Thats not gonna happen. You know how people react when they face things they dont like. They riot. They did in Egypt, they did other Arab countries, they did at Turkey which is considered most western islamic country, and they did at Ukraine. 
Numbers &gt; Powers because Numbers grant power not the other way around.
@_date: 2014-01-26 17:51:36

the thing about lira is that it is pretty stable, but stable in a way that it loses about 3% value every day since last 3 months. It will not get better until next elections which I believe current sole party will not be elected again, not as sole party atleast. Then it will go downhill until the next raise... Bitcoin a bit of an adventure I agree.

Local sales imo. 1000 btc is worth a fortune. Find a local buyer, meet with him at a bank. Ask for manager of said bank to help you, and that you will cash in 800,000$. Make sure that you get a contract signed before transfering bitcoin. Do NOT EVER give the bitcoin first. 
Edit: I dont know much about IRS but if you have a proof that you bought that much btc back then its np.  Even if you dont you will tax that money since you are depositing to a bank

Having monopoly power is no way to be defined by having more than 25% market share. In fact ECJ has decisions which say below 30% share of market is a strong indicator of not having a monopoly. 
According to ECJ you may have over 50% share and still not have a monopoly power. There is no strict rule of market share to be defined as a monopoly. Being a monopoly has multiple factors but easiest way to understand whats a monopoly is asking "is the firm considering its immediate competitor while making decisions?" And "is the firm in danger of losing value because of its immediate competitor?"
For example a market with 3 firms with shares 50/30/20 wouldnt be considered a monopoly. However if the first company controls the infastructure of production line it could be considered a monopoly. (For example if said market is cell services and only one sattelite infastructure exists)
Im not in exact knowledge of online payment market but its fair to say that monopoly is less likely to exist in software market where innovation is very possible.
