why? ... you do know that you can actually like someone and not agree with all he/she says or thinks - right? .... this is  actually  a norm in human relations FFS

I'm european, born in socialistic / communist state and I see your sentiment across the whole Europe.... Europeans in general do not understand what freedom means anymore and how important it is!... Freedom of thought in particular!

Sorry that happened to you and I hope you get access to your account back.
My only advise is actually to use regulated exchanges like Bitstamp or Kraken.... Use unregulated ones at your peril - move funds to your storage  immediately ...
Edit: comunication with regulated exchange is way better

Jack is not known for his love of freedom so I'm surprised by this endorsement. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 12:11:48
He'll probably help by banning ppl from using BTC... Haha 
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:57:14
Someone told him how much taxes they can get and he is all passion now
@_date: 2018-05-17 12:13:55
We'll Hitler had more money too - I'm guessing you would not take his tips on 'how to' now would you?

I'm sorry to hear that and as I was born and raised in communism I sympathize with you... It's going to get worst before it gets better. And the only way it will ever get better is if you fight it. They will never let go of the power voluntarily. You might have BTC, they have guns.

Sooner or later he is going to fill this space with the same ideas - some sort of "denied" servise for ppl who don't bow down to his thinking
@_date: 2019-03-21 12:09:59
Not sure what you'd like me to elaborate on?... Jack has an ideology that is closer to collectivism than individualism and uses his power to submit people to his way of thinking or cuts them off - I'm talking about Twitter - if you'd like to know more listen to Joe Rogan podcast (with Jack and Tim Pool)... Pay attention when he is explaining what they want to do - what is their goal.

I don't trust Jack Dorsay... Can't see how he can possibly like what Bitcoin represents after I watched him on JR (the second time). And I think his vision will come out sooner or later.... Tyrants can change clothes but not the soul. 
@_date: 2019-03-08 22:09:34
Better description would be Tech Tyrant, free speech oponnent, authoritarian for unknown reason buys BTC.... How long before he realises he can't control it? And starts a ban campaign lol

Green terrorist at work... Sabotaging humanity

There is no such thing as level playing field. And in fact you already are probably top 10% in the world and top 0.00001 in the history!... this time it's going to be you who is hated... Enjoy hating

I don't believe this... Kraken is the fastest one I ever used. Withdraws and deposits come from and to my bank  account the same day (in EU) !... Unless I start them after 15h....
@_date: 2019-10-21 11:16:18
Why would you ever assume any reporting is accurate is the real question?....
@_date: 2019-06-04 07:56:31
Already posting this at - 10%?... Wait till we're back at 5k haha
@_date: 2019-02-21 09:12:49
Do whatever you think is good for the future of our world... But me, I'm not giving that tecnho tyrant any money and will be extremely causius of any projects he supports. He does not belive in free speech and individual responsibility but in group guilt and central deciding power so I have no idea why he is even involved in something as free as bitcoin... And I don't believe his vision could possibly be good for us - normies 
@_date: 2019-06-05 04:50:29
He is going to post crying memes at 5k
@_date: 2019-10-30 21:53:51
How exactly is Bitcoin removing structural unferness?....??

Is that you creppy uncle Joe?..... No touching please
@_date: 2018-03-26 16:41:55
I would not trust French government... they keep on talking about 75%-100% tax on wealthy people. I'll bet they will eventually expend this to crypto - they'll try to get you money eventually 
@_date: 2018-11-01 15:37:54
Can't you solve this quickly?.. Why does it take you soo long? 
@_date: 2018-07-24 11:17:02
Ahhh this brings back memories of my childhood under socialism...... Poor Venezuelans, they got suckered in believing socialism /communism works.... Well now they know the truth 
@_date: 2018-07-30 05:42:04
Bitstamp is a licenced exchange, with fast deposit and withdraw (as is Kraken)... But with much better interface. Kraken has some extra pairs, but for fiat - Crypto that is not my main factor. 
I use both exchanges and rate them as top ones it's just that user interface wins over some extra coins. 
Ps: and I still remember Kraken laggy period when the system couldn't handle requsts due to number of new users. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:45:46
In EU I'd recommend Bitstamp over Kraken....
