I wish.  That would be a great gift... but does gifting currency violate the rule if exchanging currency?  I would like to be gifted about 100 of them.

It’s not a real word.  Metaphorically speaking I was trying to express that Bitcoin installation was welcome at Burning Man because it was considered a currency not attached to centralized bank/government.  So a currency without a brand... I know the brand is Bitcoin, But using the word metaphorically I believe works.  Even though it isn’t a real word.

Yikes you are right deleted and fixed the post.  Stupid autocorrect.
@_date: 2018-09-22 23:25:16
It was actually in the Deep Playa at the Mayan stage

It’s an art installation.  70,000 people to
to Burning Man.  I promise you all 70,000 people are not millionaires.  I am an educator on sabbatical and I went.  None of the people I went with were in tech.  Some people have elaborate gifts... I was giving out candy.  There’s still nothing intense world like it.  Bitcoin was not exchanged.  It was an art installation.

Children also go to Burning Man.  There is a Marathon at Burning Man.  A good amount of people to there and do no partying.

I know... let’s all think positively and will bitcoin back up to 10,000.... maybe 11,000 through positive energy.  Stop the negativity brahs and grahs (grah is a female brah).

Can you send me a couple.  Seriously though, congrats.  Dig the socks.

I didn’t go inside I was roaming around after Tel Aviv Pride.... in no condition to discuss crypto.  Just stumbled upon the place.
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:21:49
Stupid comment, get of the news and stop trying to politicizing everything.
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:27:07
Or keep getting down voted.  Did you expect a threat?  Grow up.
@_date: 2018-11-20 02:42:43
Please add productive things to the conversation.
@_date: 2018-11-14 08:47:46
Excuse my ignorance what is Langosch?  And I think I want one ��
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:38:21
I didn’t use the Bitcoin ATM.  I needed some forints for some goulash!
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:09:57
Keep enjoying your down votes, what do you expect a threat?  Grow up.

The tulip mania comparison doesn’t really make logical sense to me as the whole tulip mania thing lasted a year.  Crypto seems like it’s here to stay.  Just based on how many countries are investing in it... low key.

I don’t know the street, but it’s close to the Danube around the two bridges.  Just one street up from it.  I literally was exhuastrd/wandering around.

I don't know much about day trading, but would like to learn.   I don't know if I am too anxious for it.   I've been into mining and into hodling.  Of course I want to get rich ;) , but I love the philosophy behind Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:57:29
I am interested in trying some of the other things.
@_date: 2018-11-14 20:58:39
Yeah, I think I need to try some other things.  There were this potato pancakes that looked good.
@_date: 2018-11-14 15:25:55
I just had one.  It was good, if I eat too many though..... quite filling.
@_date: 2018-03-13 01:10:28
Brave day trading.  I am holding.
@_date: 2018-11-20 12:01:28
I got the conversation I want out of it.  Now go work on your memes, and like I said—-stay out of the business of grown folks. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 00:50:50
The tune constantly playing in my head.  I need to stop checking the piece a few times a day.
@_date: 2018-03-13 05:49:31
Don't you know?
Don't you know things can change
Things'll go your way
If you hodl on for one more day
Can you hodl on for one more day
Things'll go your way
Hodl on for one more day
 
@_date: 2018-11-14 08:48:06
I know.  I like seeing it pop up in random places.
@_date: 2018-02-10 05:38:53
Classic.  Screw all of these banks.  If they can create their own funny money so can the people.
@_date: 2018-11-20 08:34:31
I did this is not about price but about the cause.  Like I said add something productive to the conversation.
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:44:57
Or better yet post a meme of the moon/the stars/the office/or some hodl meme and let the grown folks talk.
@_date: 2018-11-14 08:48:36
I am in town for 15 days.  Any suggestions would be great.
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:23:24
Show's your immaturity.  Hence my stay out of the business of grown folks comment.  You had to run and tattle, then delight in the fact that you ruined a conversation that was going somewhere.  So go post a meme and grow up.
