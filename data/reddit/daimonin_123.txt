It was brough to my attention by family who still have contacts out east, and speak russian. Here's some links, sorry most of the original info is not in english, but i did what I could:

I always wonder how these self-built cars work when it comes to Insurance/registration. I mean, are you alowed to list "Me" as the manufacturer? Do you just make up a VIN?

My thought exactly. If I had money in that back, upon reading this my first action would have been to go to the bank, and close my accounts.

Alienware is owned by Dell nowadays. So... Dell started accepting bitcoins.

Not only N.Korea.
Czech republic under the communists had the same thing done, money was revalued, new currency was issued, and there was a limit to how much you could exchange. Banked money was changed automatically to that same limit.

Hmm sounds like what paypal does. "We see you just received a  large sum of money in your account. Please wait for a couple months while we lock your account and 'investigate' it."

not to defend BFL or anything, but wouldn't using the completed boxes to do what they are meant to do (mine bitcoins) be a good way to do last minute stress testing before sending it out, to prevent shipping defective products?
Edit: Disregard, answered in other posts.

By that reasoning... every foreign currency is illegal too.

I dunno, I'm trying to make a best guess at their "logic".
@_date: 2015-05-29 18:39:09
And how will you make them pay?
That's what it comes down to. Might makes right is the one real truth. If you have might, anything you claim is right, and anyone who disagrees will face the consequences of being wrong.
The government claims someone owes them a few billion? Well they are right, regardless of truth, because they can enforce their claim and punish those who refute it.

Because all money is owned by the government (or Federal Reserve but whatever). You are only borrowing it, and by laundering it he was "steeling" the governments property? And I guess they decided to just use the same logic even though no money was actually exchanged, only bitcoins.

Might makes right. Has and always will be the final and absolute truth of the world. Merica has the military power, they get to decide what is right or not.

Probably not free either? Ah fuck it, I'm currently paying $150 CAD for my internet, and that's with a 300GB/month cap and speeds that vary between acceptable and shit.

I moved my coins out of quadriga. The day before it shut down.
@_date: 2015-08-03 16:41:19
Damnit I tried that, comes back with "error reading the database, shutting down"...
@_date: 2019-12-06 02:39:26
So yeah.... I withdrew all my crpto from Quadriga... on January 2nd. Then I checked the site a few days later and it was gone.
Just thinking about how I would have felt if I did NOT do so makes me clench up so hard.
@_date: 2017-04-17 22:54:02
That's nbot the same thing. You are more like breaking into someone's house, looting it for interesting things, and if they don't track you down and request their stuff back in 6 months, you claim it now belongs to you. Of course, they have no way to know who took their stuff or how, it's just gone.
It's stealing.
@_date: 2017-04-17 22:51:32
Bullshit. I check my bitcoins rarely, how the fuck would I even know if they just disappear that it was your particular project that stole them, and not somebody else through other means? 
The default assumption is that they belong to somebody, even if they have not been touched for years. Taking them is plain and simple theft unless YOU can prove that they REALLY don't belong to anyone. Which you can't.
Even bitcoins lost to the landfill still belong to the person who lost them, at best you can request a finders fee for helping them reclaim them. Of course then they would have to prove they were actually their's and lost, and not somebody elses.
TL;DR: If you find bitcoins and take them, then you are stealing them, because the default assumption is safe to say that they belong to someone, EVEN IF THAT SOMEONE CAN'T ACCESS THEM.
But thieves gonna thief and justify it however they want.

Yeah.... Ive tried all sorts of these "survey" sites before, wether for Bitcoins or the passwords to downloaded files.
Either they are all scams and dont work, or they need to upgrade for Firefox. (Or I suppose theres a small chance Im doing something horribly wrong... everytime.)
@_date: 2012-01-04 22:32:07
Hey thanks, this looks promissing.
@_date: 2012-01-04 23:33:02
Awesome. Im even with RBC so thats good. I see they have a bill payment method too for online banking. Neat.
@_date: 2012-06-27 16:40:50
I wouldnt think its hard to do that. "I the undersigned hereby grant COMPANY X the right to open my mail for purpose of processing and scanning."
@_date: 2012-01-04 22:28:09
Yeah... its the overhead Im trying to avoid. I figure physical bitcoins are awesome enough as "comemorative" only pretty much.

Hey thanks. I'll take a look at cgminer. :)
How do I interpret that graph?

Local power rate is about 13c/kW.h.
I have to check what the gpu is exactly, though I think it was pretty heavy, sort of a shame to use it as a server.

I left an extra no in there, accident.
You are saying that if bitcoin did not exist, this attack would not happen. Im calling that as bullshit, seeing as these attacks happened long before bitcoin, and still do today, using iTunes gift cards, among others.

@_date: 2016-05-23 19:13:55
Ah yeah. Ok, if you go to Tool-&gt;Preferneces-&gt;Appearance, you can set the base unit. It's probably set to mBTC, which is 1/1000th of a BTC. AKA 1000mbtc = 1 btc.
You'll want to either keep that in mind, or change the display to something you prefer.

@_date: 2016-05-23 19:07:07
If it shows you do... where's the 400 coming from? Is it a transaction you got at some point you are not aware of? Maybe someone typoed an address and you got lucky?
@_date: 2017-05-13 00:43:09


Fixed that for you.
@_date: 2016-05-23 18:59:09
When synched, the lower left corner should show your balance. Also, the History tab is a ledger, it shows transaction time, amount, and total balance in that order. Lastly, the addresses tab shows your receiving addresses, and the balance on each one.
At least it is for me, using the electrum app... not sure why you wouldn't have those? Unless I am horribly missing something.

So... once the investigation is supposedly done, the site should go up and people would be able to log in as normal and remove their coins? 
I left some ltc in there, mostly cause I bought it with some spare change btc I had, way back when and forgot about it. It's be nice if I could get it back eventually, but how thf f would you even prove it's yours, except username/pass for the btc-e account?
@_date: 2016-05-23 19:10:52
Yes, I believe mBTC ir 1/1000th of a BTC. 
mBTC being milibitcoins.
Think metric. meter-&gt;centimetre-&gt;milimetre.
Unless the BTC community decided to use a differant convention for some odd reason.
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:58:25
Hmm its always puzzled me how if there's a planned maximum number of BTC to be released over the next 120+ years, how will the system handle misplaced (dead users, formatted wallets, forgotten passwords) coins? Would people just use smaller and smaller decimals, with the value of a bitcoin rising to compensate?
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:43:56
Bah. I had a bunch of cash and a buy order at 150.... :(
Note to self: Never leave a buy order in the system if you arn't monitoring the market.

@_date: 2013-04-30 18:57:58
Ok, what the hell? Im confused. How would the CRA even know how many bitcoins you have? Isn't that kind of one of the points for bitcoins, the inability of government oversight?
