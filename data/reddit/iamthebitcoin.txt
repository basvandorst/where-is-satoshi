Bitcoin removes the need for a middle man or payment processor. It allows you to transact directly comsumer to vendor. It removes the unnecessary processing fee while protecting the consumer from sharing sensitive information which can be compromised (ie. Credit card numbers, names, addresses). When I want to buy something online I only have to pull out my phone scan a qr code and the payment is made. These types of quick/frictionless payments are often sought after by companies as they increase number of sales thats why Paypal has done so well in the legacy system. If a merchant chooses to opt out of the volatile price of bitcoin they can easily accept bitcoin as a payment and have it instantly converted to cash using Coinbase or Bitpay's merchant solutions. Bitcoin's ecosystem is showing perpetual growth and its only getting easier to acquire and use.

Brain tree (a paypal company) just announced their beta. It was on the front page yesterday.

Obviously Bitpay and Coinbase need to spread awareness of their service

So basically anything actually important in technology is banned, but come circle jerk about the new iphone and other worthless gadgets.

No need to get upset. If you read my comment I agreed their were actually innovative alts.

Ignore the trolls they get their jollies off by disrupting/misleading conversations

Guy walking down the steeet was mugged and had wallet stolen. Fiat crime wave breakout! Hurry everyone panic!

Tell that to Ross Ulbrict and Ryan Kennedy

Pull system vs push. Keeping my private information private, or plastering it to every payment I make... I think you know which choice is best.

Some one did something bad. BLAIM BITCOIN!
@_date: 2015-02-23 03:02:23
Nothing is ever enough

There are still ways of finding out who you are with kyc compliant exchanges, or the person who you sold it to on local bitcoins could finger you in a line up. The point is bitcoin transactions can be traced, bottom line. Without this there's no proof Ulbrict's coins came from the SR or Kennedy's coins were involved in the mintpal fiasco.

The two go hand in hand.

I can confirm these allegations are false!

Sorry ripple and stellar still have no innovation or promise. There are actually altcoins that show innovation and are important in the growth and implementation of advances to the botcoin protocol, but other than indirectly benefiting bitcoin growth, they are nothing but distractions, scams, and pump and dump schemes. I would actually like to hear your case for altcoins but as I see it its just a way to indirectly inflate the bitcoin available supply. If you would like to pm or chat on irc let me know.

The solution is the problem

What if I told you your time spent trolling on reddit has done nothing to slow the progress of Bitcoin.
