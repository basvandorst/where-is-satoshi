Can someone explain what happens to bitcoin if the price goes significantly above 1 mil? I know we're a long ways off but if 1 satoshi is 1 millionth of a bitcoin then wouldn't we need smaller denominations of btc?

There is a limit to how much you can deduct from your income. 3k in us I believe. So if you wanted to sell your losers and keep your winners and you have positions that will net you 50k down you'd want to sell 47k of gains to not waste the deduction. And you could wait 30 days to put the money back to avoid a wash rule and now you have a stepped up basis. Not that I think this is necessarily what is happening though.

On the flipside I would expect to see articles like, Creator of bitcoin loses 1 mil bitcoin permanently. To cause most people out of the know to panic.

What should someone who holds bitcoin but doesn't mine bitcoin Do? Just wait for the dust to settle and figure it out later?
