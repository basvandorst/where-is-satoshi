This is real deal, I have been with these guys for about a month now. You can watch the market and sell your hashing power when its value is high like before difficulty change and buy back when its low after difficulty increases. You also get access to their private mining pool.

The upcoming crash will balance this back out, no worries. Just let the crazies buy / sell at the current valuation. Im cashing out before it's too late then buying back at a fair market valuation.

It's crazy to buy at the current price right now. Wait until after the re-balance.

Do you really think this trend will not stop or are all the comments here trolls trying to fuel their greed to drive the price up? $500+ Is an unreasonable valuation for bitcoin at the moment. It's all speculative buying from greedy people selling. If you are buying in at $500+ be ready to get hurt financially when it crashes, not if but when. If you were smart you would prepare for the crash that could potentially happen. There is no guarantee that this hearing will continue to drive up the price. Honestly the price needs to fall back to a realistic $150 mark.

[cex.io]( allows you to buy and sell hashing power without the need for hardware investment. You can then sell back the hashing power at a later time for market price. It's the latest in Cloud Mining.
