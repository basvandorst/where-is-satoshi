Generally easy platform with backup and restore and high security I would say is Exodus if you’re just starting. I have sent my friends looking into crypto to that wallet and use it myself.
But more than half a bitcoin in my opinion would necessitate a hardware storage wallet like KeepKey, Ledger, or Trezor. 
Just make sure you know what you’re doing so you don’t suffer any crazy losses.

Let’s break it down:
Don’t = do not  
You’re = you are
“Do not talk about you are Bitcoin” ??? You’ve now confused me.

I thought the first rule was:  
“Talk about Bitcoin.”  
And the second rule was:  
“Don’t talk about ***your*** Bitcoin.”

This is too true to my responses. XD

Maybe third can be:  
don’t claim *you are* Satoshi Nakamoto, but instead claim *we are all* Satoshi Nakamoto  
Then rule four:  
Obey first 3 rules no matter what.

They're both ok. Coinbase generates a new address for your wallet (almost) every time you hit the get address button. They are all equally valid and can be reused. I remember this scared me a little when I first started with Coinbase.
I assume this is done to help the wallet holder know where the value was received, for example work payroll on address 1, mining payout on address 2, that kind of stuff. 
You'll notice there seems to be no shortage of the wallet addresses you have available. I believe I have somewhere near 50 by now.

Does the paper wallet mass include the mass of the QR code or not? Given the mass of QR Code itself I wouldn’t expect it to matter much. But given the distances covered it very well may be significant.

Welcome to the party. Never be afraid to reach out and ask questions, Coinbase makes for an easy starting platform with simple controls, great for beginners. 
Do some research about how to use BTC, LTC, ETH, etc. and into the other types of wallets and speak up if you have any questions. I've never been short on getting answers when I had questions, and it's an interesting (if not hella confusing) world with crypto. Just remember to keep an open ear.

I use cryptowat.ch typically. Doesn’t have /everything/ I would personally like, but there is quite a lot. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 22:53:11
What exactly is this?
@_date: 2017-06-25 01:01:33
A bit of JavaScript ought to solve that right up for calculation. As for current price, you /could/ do an api query from cryptowat.ch for the current price, maybe even integrate shapeshift to allow other crypto payments. Many options out there.

I haven’t looked into this. But if you lookup how to parse a JSON response using JavaScript or jQuery it shouldn’t be too difficult. Good luck in your quest!

So you did a bank wire/transfer?
Says right on the site that takes 5-7 days.
For me it’s been
day 5: $ withdrawn from bank
Day 7: ฿ deposited to account
Or debit card (instant): 30 seconds max, $ withdrawn, ฿ deposited. 
Not sure if you’re trying to inform people of what you *think* is a flaw. Or complaining about something you clearly didn’t read.
