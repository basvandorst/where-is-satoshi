You can always buy upvotes if you're that desperate.

What will you say when it's back up? Positive shit I'm sure. Everyone's a hypocrite when there's money on the line.
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:37:35
Maybe they combine transactions to minimize impact of fees.

All posts here: Bitcoin will never outright crash, keep your money here.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:06:21
Yeah, it's all a fucking conspiracy. God this sub is so biased.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:48:16
And if the value happens to drop permanently? Sure you have bitcoins, but they can't be traded.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:05:19
Fox news is trash, and CNN is about the same level, with a bit less outright lies.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:01:37
Don't you put money in a bank for long term? Bitcoin is not known for long-term stability
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:40:04
Oh come on.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:05:20
For other coins of similar value, a 10% change isn't that big. Y'all are overreacting.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:46:52
What's wrong with BCH, ignoring coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-27 07:40:56
It's fucking money, it's going to bring the worst out in people no matter what. Every time.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:50:33
It is a fork, so it should be the same otherwise. Bitcoin has a 400k/day limit, its not going to work for this many people for long.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:25:20
Open source projects would love even $1k. May I suggest Elementary OS? They do great work.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:35:55
That sure is reassuring. You invested, why should you fail?
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:15:34
It's in the mods best interests to have more risky money in Bitcoin. They are absolutely involved in this propaganda sub.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:16:27
Fascinating. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:25:33
My iq isn't high enough
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:32:45
Oh my God get over it the world isn't ending. Who stores all their coin on an online wallet anyways?
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:35:13
Coinbase is sometimes failing to load. RIP
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:13:32
Oh my God fuck off it's not us vs them. You are spreading FUD for BCH and Bitcoin. I've invested in both, and will continue to. There's objectively no harm in it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:40:51
No one doesn't want more money. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:47:10
Yes, its spreading FUD in the Crypto community. Who says we HAVE to be against them? We can profit from any coin.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:11:44
Yeah but fuck those bch guys right?
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:08:50
How is this not FUD? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:48:05
Bitcoin is considered secure?
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:24:56
Declare your pride and accomplishment in Battlefront.
@_date: 2018-08-14 17:43:28
@_date: 2018-06-23 17:34:53
Some people killed themselves over it. 
@_date: 2019-04-02 14:41:55
Uhh wasn't it like 16k a year ago?
@_date: 2018-11-22 14:41:30
Oh is Bitcoin still a thing?
@_date: 2018-07-12 04:54:59
"buy Bitcoin" post  of the day
@_date: 2018-07-18 18:33:15
A wallet code that locks down if used
@_date: 2019-05-07 22:08:23
Maybe because they really don't care. It's not their thing. It's your weird thing.
