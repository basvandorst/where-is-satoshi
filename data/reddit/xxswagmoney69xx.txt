I'm new to BTC, just bought $2,000 worth. How do I handle the fork? Not really even sure what it is, I've done some research and kinda have a grasp on it but I don't understand the two different blockchains 
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:22:49
I've been skeptical of everyone saying it'll hit 10k anyway. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:32:04
Gonna buy more soon as I get home!
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:42:46
Could you elaborate, clearly I'm a noob
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:34:56
Happy for you!
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:29:02

@_date: 2017-11-17 22:06:20
Instructions unclear...dick stuck in toaster
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:13:22
Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:00:18
