I’m familiar with the theory. I’m pointing out one of the flaws. The monkeys could be typing gibberish for all eternity, having never typed out any of Shakespeare’s works.  
That probability exists, hence it’s not accurate to say “the monkeys **will** type [insert literature here]”, but it is accurate to say the monkeys **might**.  
This also holds true if you’re thinking about real monkeys (they could just be pressing g-g-g-g-g for all eternity) or metaphorical ones (that create random strings and characters).  
To look at it another way, the only way to guarantee Shakespeare would be written is to have a direct guided approach like a, aa, aaa, aaaa, ab, aab, aaab, etc to make sure new patterns were always used.  
Otherwise... it’s potentially an eternity of gibberish.

Where you are born is a very significant factor.  
Think about it:  if you were born on the mountainside of a war-torn third world country, do you think you’d be the same person?  I’m under no illusion here:  I would not be.  Experiences change people, and if no one ever instilled the importance of education over say, warfare or foraging for food to survive the night, I wouldn’t care about education.  
Now if I were to guess, you’re thinking “but that’s a war-torn country, what about America or another first-world country?”  It’s exactly the same. If you were born into the projects in Chicago or the hollers of Kentucky, the deck is going to be stacked *heavily* against you. Less people come out of those environments as successfully as affluent areas.  
I think that’s why you’re getting downvoted.

How can you tell the person you responded to doesn't have much savings?
@_date: 2017-09-20 17:15:54
I put about 3% of my gross monthly pay into crypto. The bulk of my savings rate goes into traditional channels like 401k, index funds, etc.  
It’s all coming from side hustle money though, so I wouldn’t feel as bad if it all goes poof for years. It also doesn’t negatively affect my retirement date either, so that seems like a win-win.

Coinbase is an exchange, so think of it as a list of IOU slips. If Coinbase shuts down right this moment, your crypto is gone with no protection. As soon as you set up your hardware wallet (smart move), transfer a tiny fraction from Coinbase to your Nano to make sure it works, then transfer the rest.  Only then do you own your crypto that you bought on Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:36:01
Maybe some do. I thought the context here was the US, are you expanding this to worldwide now?
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:35:50
Not agreed. The amount doesn’t matter, less than a Bitcoin isn’t a waste.  
There may be a day when people bug their eyes out if you tell them there was a day when you bought 0.1 bitcoin.  You could have said this 2 years ago with “just buy 10 bitcoins and you’ll be set.”  It’s all relative.  
Milestones are fun for crypto, but not necessary.

Oh, we’d have to skip the third world comparisons then since they don’t apply.  It’s like the saying goes, “if my uncle had tits, he’d be my aunt”.  
And a 16 year old could have a 100% savings rate, since they’re dependents. That doesn’t make it realistic to include them, since the vast majority of adults don’t have all of their expenses covered.  
@_date: 2017-09-13 23:35:43
Ha!  Dollar cost averaging. It means if you buy smaller amounts at different price points instead of one big purchase, it helps smooth out losses for dips.

Read it again. They insure themselves, not customers.  Online crypto only, which they say is 2%. The other 98% are uninsured IOU’s. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 00:21:48
IMO it doesn’t make sense to measure by net worth, since that can change drastically. For example, if you take 50% of your net worth and buy crypto and there’s a huge spike, it might look like 80% or 90%.  
Instead, why not measure it as a percentage of your savings rate?  That works independently of gains/losses in crypto, and shows how far in people are going.  
In my case my savings rate is around 38%, and I’ve been putting 15% into crypto until I hit a couple personal milestones. Then it gets dialed back so it doesn’t affect my projected early retirement date if all crypto tanked (which I don’t think it will, but plan for the worst and all that).

Ok, I did your research for you.  
**Bitcoin XT**, 8/15/2015. Did not rally before the fork or after. There was a downward price trend unchanged by the fork.  
**Bitcoin Unlimited**, 1/2016. Did not rally before or after the fork, but this is inconclusive without knowing the exact release date.  No major swings either way.    
**Bitcoin Classic**, 2/10/2016. Did not rally before or after the fork. There was a slight upward trend unchanged by the fork.  
**Bitcoin Cash**, 8/1/2017. Did not rally before the fork, but did after the fork.  
Then you said the price will drop right after the Bitcoin Gold fork on 10/25, based on historical evidence.  NONE of the previous forks support this claim. You had no evidence to support your prediction. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:44:10
Haha, yep. Just matching the same language as the OP. When they do it, it’s running up a bill and kinda sorta maybe not paying it but it was wrong so don’t judge!!1  When WF retrieves the money they’re owed, it’s theft!  
Really though, there’s no way to tell if this was fair or not. What we can tell is this is a pretty clear case of a crime of opportunity.

@_date: 2017-10-27 17:18:21
You can just search for “savings rate by income level” or something like that. [Here’s a source]( Note how a whopping 8 out of 10 Americans making $40k or less are saving less than 5% of their income, and the majority of them (51%) don’t even save a dime.  
You can use that to get a more accurate spread of savings rates across incomes, but then take a fraction of that to see what people would be willing to invest in something as volatile as crypto. Maybe their savings rate is 5% but they’d only want to invest a max of 0.1% of their savings into crypto. So that’s $400 for savers in that group, but cut it down by half since 51% of people in that income strata save nothing. So $200 per capita in that range.  Getting pretty hairy already, right?
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:25:20

Which is more likely, we’re at the final ATH now, or people will lose boatloads of money waiting for a future dip that’s more expensive than today’s ATH?  
The world is going to be a very, very different place if/when crypto doesn’t increase in value. There’s no point in discussing that right now.  
The very real and tangible mistake people are doing now is “waiting for the dip”.  Agreed?

I think you misunderstood theirs too. If you were to trade on a 50x margin, you could double your money if it goes up 2% (2% x 50 = 100%).  At the same time if it goes down 2%, you lose it all.  Happens every day.  
The point being what you don’t know CAN hurt you, and there are ways to lose it all even if bitcoin drops only 2%.  That’s why people say only to work with what you can lose (not just 10% lose, but 100% lose).

I just asked Statistics, he doesn’t know the future either.  
Sarcasm aside, as someone that works in predictive data analytics, making accurate forecast models for cryptocurrency is just about impossible. The volatility we’ve seen in the last few years isn’t something we can accurately predict, especially years out. It’s not like we have 100 years of data to run Monte Carlo sims on it either.  
That doesn’t stop people from making their own forecasts anyway.  That’s why you see people making claims for $7k or $100k, they’re pulling numbers out of their butts.  
Here’s how I look at it:  there is pretty wild volatility short-term, but trending upward long-term. How much is a guessing game, but upward gains are still a win. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:50:46

They’re not saying it to be jerks, they’re offering sound financial advice.  
You seem to be putting money you need to live in a place where it can go poof.  It happened with MtGox, it can happen with other exchanges.  
When people say “only invest the money you can lose”, try imagining it in literal terms. Can you take that money you put in and light it on fire, and still meet all your financial obligations?  If so, congratulations!  You’re being financially responsible. But if that money fire would cause you tons of stress and you’d have to scramble to pay your bills (by selling your stuff or borrowing from others), then it’s financially not responsible to invest that in crypto. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 14:09:21

“Never put in more than you’re willing to lose.”  
You’ll hear that a lot around here. What would happen if you put in the college fund and HELOC, then the crypto drops by 40% and stays that way for years?  
Don’t measure your holdings by your net worth. It changes every day, kinda meaningless. Why not figure out what percentage of each paycheck you don’t need for years, and invest that?  
@_date: 2017-10-28 12:59:41
Exactly. Every day fewer and fewer people can afford to buy a full Bitcoin at a time. It doesn’t matter though. The percentage growth is identical, so a 50% return on your money is still 50% whether a Bitcoin sells for $2 or $200,000.

I could cite study after study showing how day traders loss out to dollar cost averaging. I could cite leading industry experts stating the same. There’s a reason why people generally don’t recommend trying to time the market, especially this early on with crypto.  
There are other common phrases besides “it’s not about timing the market, it’s about time IN the market” or “past performance does not guarantee future performance” or “nobody has a crystal ball”.  
Let’s face it. If you were able to successfully time the market, you wouldn’t be here replying, you’d be out partying on one of your yachts in St Tropez with bikini models.  
Everybody thinks they’re an above-average driver and everybody thinks they’re an above-average investor. But like yet another saying goes, “everyone is a genius in a bull market”.  
This is why they were downvoted. Bad advice that statistically is far more likely to cause losses, not gains. Bad advice, no matter how badly you want that to be good advice.

That’s the trouble with comparing BTC to USD though. If BTC was $5.50, it would only be “worth it” if someone bought 1,000 BTC?  Of course not.  That $5500 is an arbitrary amount whether it buys 1,000 BTC or 1 BTC or 0.001 BTC.  
And for what it’s worth, spending $5,500 on one BTC is out of reach for the majority of Americans already, so that ship has sailed.

I always blindly accept guarantees from people that can’t spell guarantee!  
For anyone else reading this, there is no guarantee that a future dip will be below today’s all-time high. You could be “buying a dip” for more than today’s all-time high price. Don’t bother trying to time the market, you win just by buying.

No trolling here. You think there are some circumstances where the market can be timed, I disagree with that. It seems quite clear.  
Everybody thinks they have the market figured out, just like everybody thinks they’re an above-average driver. The evidence is overwhelmingly against people that think they can predict the market because of reason X or reason Y or reason Z. It doesn’t matter what X, Y, or Z is.

They look at it as a milestone that gets further and further out of reach.  
Like you said though. It doesn’t really matter what the value of one coin is. If the worth goes up by 50%, it doesn’t matter if a Bitcoin is $5 or $5,000,000. Your $100 investment will be worth $150 either way. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:18:31
Why worry about buying a single dip?  Expand the time horizon and we're always in a dip.  What would you give to buy bitcoin when the all-time high was $100?  $800?  Even if there was a dip after that, you'd still be way ahead today.  
Don't worry about dips. Buy when you can afford it and the long-term gains will take care of the rest.

Yeah, I think it depends very much on the amount withdrawn and how. People will have to leverage tax loss harvesting and other techniques to avoid those hits.  
Registering those wallets would be a scary thought. It’s one step closer to centralization.  
I think you’re right too, the government/federal reserve are going to be fighting crypto to get control. For example, why does the federal reserve print more currency?  And what happens when that ability gets taken away if Bitcoin takes over?  You can’t print more Bitcoin — UNLESS they strong arm a fork into Bitcoin A, Bitcoin B, Bitcoin C etc, each with a different blockchain.

The smart day traders don’t use their emergency fund (money for bills like housing and food) for investments.  
If all your debts are paid and you have 3-6 months of living expenses, any money past those 3-6 months worth of savings can be used for investing.  
So assuming you’re a smart day trader, use limit orders at different price points since you won’t need the money for months anyway.  No need to watch the market every 2-4 hours, your orders do the work for you and you reap the rewards.

If you can put that $100 in a time capsule, and wouldn’t open it for years, **and it won’t affect your life today**, go for it.   
It doesn’t matter when you invest in relation to all time highs. It matters when you cash out.  For example, what if you bought when the all time high was $700?  You’d have 1/7th of a bitcoin, which is almost $750 now.  
Ignore people saying not to buy at an all time high. They’re only considering the short term. You and I consider the long term, so all time highs are meaningless.

You missed the time element. If yesterday’s ATH is $42k but someone was “waiting for the dip”, and the dip was today at $45k, that’s a $3k opportunity cost.  
In other words, “buy the dip” doesn’t always work out, sometimes it’s worse.  
It’s not about timing the market (buying the dip), it’s about time IN the market.

Glad that helps!  Before you start, also do your research on what the success rate for new day traders is. Spoiler alert:  it’s *extremely low*. Odds are overwhelmingly assured that you will lose money.  
Want to find out safely?  Keep a spreadsheet or notes with your money but don’t actually invest. Make a fake “buy” order when you think you’d buy, sell when you think you’d sell. Be honest with it too. If you’re making all sorts of money with fake trades over the first few months, try it with some of your money to burn.  
That’s the best way to see if you’re A) ready and B) potentially good at it.

I work in predictive data analytics. My very livelihood depends on how effectively we can forecast using data-driven models. Not saying I’m a leading industry expert, but I do know a thing or two about it.  
You have provided neither the data you used nor responded to the list of objective reasons why a Monte Carlo simulation is inappropriate for crypto projections.  You substitute personal attacks and a strawman (when did I say you’re not allowed to explore other areas?)... which is very telling.  
Now as a professional in the field, I wouldn’t even attempt to forecast crypto at this stage in the game (due to the reasons I outlined earlier).  If you were to provide the data I had asked for twice already, I could show you some ways a Monte Carlo sim breaks down for crypto.

Did more digging.  It seems on the main security page for Coinbase [here]( it also only refers to online storage being insured, so very little.  And [here]( are other people unsuccessfully trying to figure the same thing out months ago.  
The [Coinbase Reddit people]( don't seem to mention insurance either.  
I was able to find [this article]( too, showing it's insured through AON (or was at one point).  If I had to guess, I'd still lean towards just insuring that 2% since insuring the full amount of crypto would be significantly more expensive to insure.

Most Americans live paycheck to paycheck. Most studies show the majority can’t raise $500 or $1000 in case of an emergency.  
I think this helps put things in perspective:  even if you own “only” 0.1 BTC, you already have more than most Americans could afford to buy.  Every day that 0.1 BTC is more and more out of reach for most Americans.  
A 10% savings rate depends on the income level too. It’s a lot easier for someone making $100k/year to save 10% vs someone in extreme poverty (like the $10k/year person).  $1000 might as well be a million for them, when you’re talking about someone weighing a Bitcoin investment vs feeding their hungry children.

I think day trading studies apply here too, so let’s agree to disagree there.  
I do admit this is anecdotal, but this sub is full of “I wish I had bought at an earlier ATH vs waiting for a dip” people. I think there’s a lot of wisdom in that, since people could miss out if they were on the sidelines during a rally waiting for a dip, only to have a dip that is still above the earlier ATH.  
I also put a little more weight into those experiences because people like to brag about big wins, but don’t like to brag about big losses nearly as much. So if we’re seeing this many “wish I DCA’d more”, it’s reasonable to assume there’s a larger number of people that silently lost out by trying to time a crypto market.  
Sound fair?
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:28:55

There is overwhelming evidence that most people that try to time the market fail. They might get lucky here or there, but lose money overall.  
That’s completely different from your recommendation — a solid one I might add — of setting up recurring buys, which is known as Dollar Cost Averaging. It’s the exact opposite of trying to time the market.

Those 16 year olds are dependents, they shouldn’t be included in the distribution. If we open it up to all ages and incomes, a toddler that gets $10 for a birthday gift could have a 100% savings rate since they don’t know how to spend it. Your calculation is then way too low, your market cap should be the entire store of wealth in the US divided by the entire population. It’s meaningless.  
People won’t be putting 100% of whatever their savings rate is into investments. It’s just not realistic. You should be finding out what percentage the typical American saves, then what percentage of that is typically used for investing. Then of that fraction of a fraction, you figure out how much they would be willing to put into crypto instead of a traditional 401k, IRA, index fund, etc.  
10% is waaaaaay too high. Most Americans don’t save even 10% total, and far fewer invest all of their savings (since they keep part for expenses, emergency funds, etc).

You’re saying there is a correlation between forks and bitcoin price. Can you show evidence for that with every fork?  No. Sometimes the price fluctuates before and after a fork, other times it doesn’t. Remember Bitcoin XT?  Downward trend before and after the fork. There were other forks that didn’t change the pricing trend of BTC too.
