Not really that fee is built in to the price of the item you are buying, along with the cost of the average chargebacks over time.

Also not an issue with Bitcoin, this is an issue with Coinbase not updating to segwit after complaining about high fees and slow transactions.

I would argue for option A for the simple fact that you are using a computer connected to the internet.   
You are using the OSI model and it is not a simple elegant solution in one step.  
See when you send post on a website it does not just use HTTP, oh no, it uses layers to talk to the server.  
* Application to interact with network
* Presentation for data and encryption
* Session for interhost communication 
* Transport to provide reliability
* Network the logical path
* Data Link The physical addressing of machines
* Physical the actual wires   
   
With just one solution of wires we would not have any of the internet, each part is separate and builds on the one below it.  
This is what the LN is a layer that uses the blockchain to further how the network of money will exist.

You are mistaken, you load your account with funds and then  just shop. The node you started on will settle all transactions to the chain once a day/week/etc and it is as simple as my budget for the week for everything is 1000$ so I will load my debit card/visa card/lighting wallet (for comparison) for the week and then just shop.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:02:56
Wallets will do this for you automatically, your funds will be secured on the chain and your wallet will keep an active channel open for you so you can transaction. In this case one would hope that the wallet offered an option to turn that off, change the node you use, and limit the amount it auto loads or how often it tops that up.

The problem with short sighted solutions is that you always have a shortsighted solution that will solve the current issue and create a bigger issue down the road. And it is always said that we will over come that issue later.    
But in reality a new short sighted solution is put in place and only creates bigger and bigger issues.

You did the correct thing for your description.  
If a company will not talk on proper channels then you can present your case to the people and if the company cares they can defend them themselves here also.  
Nothing might happen for you, but you have now told the public your story and that is power.

Your points are a very good reason to fund this, because the more ideas you have to achieve the goal the more likely someone will have the right method. It is better to try several methods then hope one works out.

@_date: 2017-08-09 17:30:52
Looking at the fee I see that it was less then 7sat/B, this transaction will likely take between 4-infinity blocks. This transaction is not likely to be accepted any time soon if at all, I would recommend a transaction fee of at lest 80 sat/B if you can wait a day or 120 sat/B if you want it done in the next hour.
  
You can see the fee to transaction times here
