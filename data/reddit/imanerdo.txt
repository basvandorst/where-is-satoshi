Hahaha yeah man thanks for that i was having a horrible day but hey I want to share something with you... Dont get into this world of Bitcoin if you are going to treat itnas a Stock, come here and support Bitcoin because you believe it will change the world is been rule by.... Imagine not having to get a middle man who will be monitoring eveything you do (Banks)... Do you know the frustration people have trying to move money internationally? Think about those individual who have access to internet but not tona bank... Think about the  time it takes to do a Wire transfer and a Bitcoin transfer... Its all about on how you look at it... At the beginning i thought this was all fraud and scheme but i have seen the evolution... This is revolutionary trust me now days you dont see many people paying bills with cash at all it is all electronically now imagine having a bank without maintenance fees just transaction fees of a third of a cent.... If you dont do it for you do it for your next generation, your kids, your grandkids... They would be so proud that you did and who knows it might be their best gift , who knows if with 100 or 200 dollars that you invest today you can pay off their student education and more... Who knows brother this isnthe beginning of a new technology jump in support the future

Hey Bud go get you a gold chain and tell me what else ojther than wear it you can do with it.... Buy a Bitcoin in the other hand and tell me all the options you have... The fact that both are limited supply makes them have value...  Real question is... If you are so against our technology why are you in our pages? Go comment on your Gold subreddit... Im sure the old folks know too much about technology :) you probably mad you couldnt get in earlier and many people you see cashing out thousands of dollars and gold barely makes moves of couple dollas a day lmaoooo
