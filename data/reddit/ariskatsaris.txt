How do you make the opposite judgment? On my part I see immediate dire limitations to Bitcoin's usability, so that business are dropping it, and it costs more than any other traditional payment system. I don't see what problems would be caused with increasing the blockweight limit from 4M to 8M or even 16M. 


Obviously there is. Similar to what Satoshi suggested you change the code to say that from (e.g) height 520,000 (or 530,000 or 550,000 or whatever) onwards is allowed to be 8M rather than 4M. Plenty of time, so that everyone grabs the update till then.


Why? Who would care to mine the coin with the smaller block size, if both Core and miners agree to increase the block size? Would *you* mine the smaller blocksize, do you have the hashpower to do so?
And even if some people did, nobody would care about them. The 'true' bitcoin would be seen as the one that the Core team approves of, much like it's Ethereum and not 'Ethereum Classic' that has inherited the Ethereum name.


I remind you that promoting altcoins is forbidden in this subreddit, so why are you suggesting this, in violation of the subreddit's rules? 
On my part I'd rather argue for improving Bitcoin, rather than promote altcoins like you're doing.

Both blocksize increases (Segwit or a direct hardfork) have the exact same promotion of centralization. How can you think otherwise.
Yes, I agree that Segwit has additional advantages, but it's not those advantages that most the people here seem to care about, they only care about the lower fees as produced by the bigger (centralization-promoting) blocks.

Perhaps you should stop overusing the word for people that just disagree with you about what usability is.


So that's what suffices to make a network 'usable'? Okay I should have specified 'unusable for the majority of use cases that it had once been usable for'. If you want to transfer thousands of USD worth of BTC it remains usable (though still less useful than the traditional banking system). It's unusable for payments though.

Do you understand that bigger blocks is what the OP wants to accomplish with his petition and he's been upvoted 791 times, yes or no?
Segwit enables bigger blocks, and if your argument is correct the centralization you claim is enabled by it just as well.
And it's more likely banks would rather Bitcoin be kept small-block and hence in its current state of unusability as a payment service. It's because of the high fees that selling to individuals for cash has become impossible, all selling and buying can only happen via centralised exchanges.
So actually high fees help cause centralisation, you see. Perhaps you should go work for a bank. Perhaps you already do.

The befefit of Segwit to Bitcoin that most people seem to care about is its tertiary sideeffect of causing lower fees by having bigger blocks.

Blocks are, since Segwit's activation, limited not by number of bytes, but by a metric called 'block weight'. Segwit transactions 'weigh' less per byte, so more Segwit bytes can fit in a block than non-Segwit bytes.
So the same fee/weight unit means a lesser fee/bytes for Segwit transactions, and a lesser fee in total.

And it also adds so much implementation effort wallets &amp; exchanges can't be bothered to support it, not even the Core team has fully supported it in the reference implementation yet! While a hardfork blocksize increase would be immediately usable by all exchanges and wallets.


It was also the solution that Satoshi had come up with. Now of course it's perfectly valid to argue that Satoshi was *wrong*, but are you really accusing Satoshi of being a 5-year old?

If you think keeping small blocks are an attack, you may just as well argue that Core is effectively attacking BTC by not hardforking to bigger blocks.
There are other arguments for Segwit but you cannot use the argument that it reduces fees by increasing blocksize, and bash non-implementors as attackers, unless you are willing to bash Core in the same manner - both for not fully implementing Segwit in their wallet, and for not hardforking to bigger blocks and thus increasing fees.

Exact same way all blocksize increases supposedly promote centralization. Can you explain how a hardfork blocksize increase promotes centralization (which you claimed above)?

Anyone in the world running a node and 'getting a vote' is a problem. It's a problem that Satoshi fixed by saying that hashpower votes, not number of nodes.
If nodes vote, then what prevents a single person from putting up a thousand nodes and getting a thousand votes, without need to spend hashpower?


It's not meant to be, it's meant to be a hashpower-cratic system. But even if it were supposed to be democratic, how do you ascertain that each node is run by a different individual?


Bitcoin doesn't have better decentralization. Users of Bitcoin Cash can make small transactions, so they can exchange their BCH for cash with other individuals in peer to peer fashion. Users of BTC on the other hand are always forced to go through centralized exchanges because otherwise transaction fees would take away any profit.

If we accept that there's only one Bitcoin then I agree with you that BTC deserves the name more than Bitcoin Cash, (majority determined by hashing power).
But (1) that would mean that if Segwit2x had worked and ended up with the majority of hashpower, then *it* would be considered the one and true Bitcoin, and the BTC supported by Core would no longer be considered that. Would you agree that argument?
(2) It depends on the assertion that there can indeed only ever be one Bitcoin. I on the other hand don't find anything illogical with there existing two or more different bitcoins.

Well if you don't want a blocksize increase, you moron, you shouldn't want anyone to use Segwit. I supported Segwit because I did want the blocksize increase it brought (and also its other benefits)

I'm saying that since there's a split in the community, neither of them should pretend to be the one true Bitcoin (as Satoshi created/intended it) and neither of them should try to thrust undesirable names onto the other. Instead both sides should acknowledge, that yes there are two Bitcoins now, and give distinguishing names to each.
Similar to how after the split in Christianity back in medieval times there then existed Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox, and each of them claim to be the proper Christians, but we still need names that distinguish them without taking sides who the proper Christians are.


Right now there's only one significant 'reference implementation' for "Bitcoin", that being Bitcoin Core -- so it makes for a good name. (I don't think many people use Bitcoin Knots)
Bitcoin ABC / Bitcoin Unlimited / Bitcoin XT whatever are in fact also following slightly different implementations related to the blocksize, which might hypothetically cause them to split into different coins if there are ever blocks &gt; 8 MB, but right now they all follow the same blockchain, so the clearest way to refer to them collectively is as "Bitcoin Cash". If they do split, they will indeed have to be called by their reference implementation names (Bitcoin ABC, etc) for clarity's sake.

The current foreign minister of Greece, a former member of the Communist Party of Greece, wanted the Polish communist dictatorship to crush the striking workers during the 1980s, statements that he's now attributing to orders he received by the Communist Party of Greece. (
So forgive me if given his example, and the example of the Communist Party of Greece, I think that the communists don't give a damn about worker causes, except to the extent it helps get them power.

No. See 


The problem is that when you use addwitnessaddress, the wallet explicitly imports that address. This means you either need to create a wallet backup after every new address, or risk not finding transactions after a restore.  
In the next version we plan to have a configurable address type (legacy, p2sh, bech32), which works correctly with backups. At that point, it will also be safe to enable from the GUI.


Payment channels, don't confuse them with the lightning network which is something that builds on top of payment channels but is much more than that.


It's not at all clear that increasing the blocksize would cause a bigger risk to 'centralization' than not increasing it. For example high fees means that small miners joining a mining pool would lose their profits to transaction fees.

As long as you have the keys of the legacy account, you have your BCH yes.
There's full replay protection so no transaction you make in the bitcoin network can affect the BCH network or vice versa. The only danger is if your private keys get leaked by malicious software.
Hence the advice to transfer your bitcoin before you claim your bcash, so as to ensure that even if you use a bcash wallet that's hacked, and it leaks your private  keys, you won't lose your bitcoins.

I've consistently supported you against the liars and slanderers of r/btc but I can't support this insulting offensive attitude of yours anymore.
Segwit has failed its promise. You guys promised Segwit would give in practice 2MB blocks, in practice it gives 1.1MB. You guys implied Lightning Network would be effectively up and running by now, we still don't yet know how many years away it is.
I want you to apologize over your delight in high fees, and I want Core to start on an actually implementable plan to make fees low again and Bitcoin usable again, a plan which should be allowed to potentially include hardforking if such is needed.

Get Electrum and create a Segwit wallet. When the mempool eases up consolidate all your input into the segwit wallet. With a single input and a Segwit address you'd not be paying more than 2$ to transfer them to an exchange then, the onerous task is the *consolidation of inputs*.
In the meantime extract your BCH consolidate those things too. Also your BTG but be very careful about what wallet you use there, I'd suggest Coinomi rather than the official wallet (no, you can't trust even the official BTG wallet) You can consolidate both BCH and BTG right now.

Segwit is a **conditional** block size increase **that depends on users using Segwit transactions**.
Unlike a hardfork blocksize increase, which would be an unconditional blocksize increase, and companies wouldn't have had to move to a new transaction type in order to give us a blocksize increase.
Segwit was a malleability fix, and served as a malleability fix, to thus possibly enable Lightning Network somewhere in the future (if that ever gets implemented).
Segwit has however been demonstrated to be almost useless as a blocksize increase, promising 2MB blocks and giving us about 1.1 MB blocks instead, seemingly because it demands a development investment from companies that not many of them are eager to commit to.

You may say it's wrong for them to do so, but you can't say it's 'contradictory'.
There's also the argument that e.g. increasing the blocksize is an improvement that needs be made just in miner-software, while using Segwit is a change that needs be implemented in every wallet &amp; client software, so increasing blocksize is considered to have a far better cost/benefit ratio, if one sees it just from the perspective of how many transactions-we-can-fit-in-a-block.
Keep in mind that Segwit would make absolutely no sense if it was *just* meant as a way to increase effective blocksize -- that's only a tertiary goal. Segwit is instead primarily meant to fix malleability, secondarily make certain other improvements mostly unrelated to the blocksize (e.g. reducing UTXO bloat, allowing script versioning, etc), and only as an afterthought of an afterthought it's used to increase blocksize.

And as for the LN, it's not here yet, and the Core team could have chosen to increase the blocksize as a stopgap until we have it. 
Yes, an increasing blocksize won't be a feasible solution FOR ALL TIME, but that doesn't mean that bitcoin must remain unusable for now.
Stop increasing the blocksize *when* we have the Lightning Network ready. Until then, don't use the non-yet-existing solution as an excuse to not solve the problem that Bitcoin is *currently* facing.

Well I agree. But you know what's a different way of having bigger blocks and thus allowing more transactions per block? It's called "a hardfork to increase blocksize".

If you think that the fee problem is so very urgent, then perhaps you should encourage Core to increase the blocksize, which would allow transactions to have lower fees without need for every service &amp; wallet to spend development &amp; testing effort.

The point of Segwit was primarily to be a soft-fork malleability fix. Then a secondary goal became reducing UTXO bloat.
A blocksize increase and 'alleviating fee pressure' was at most a tertiary side-benefit.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:55:10
You should definitely mind the fee. You're not doing 'something for the network' if you're using bitcoin when it's against your benefit to use it. (the opposite, you'd be congesting it for people who'd have an actual benefit in using it)
We should be using bitcoin exactly because it's actually to *our benefit* to use it. This means that the fees must be *lower* than other means of payment, or that there are other benefits.

We were told that LN was ready, and that it effectively just needed Segwit to get activated. This turned out to be be utter bullshit and I therefore likewise expect it to be utter bullshit that it just needs a couple more months.
So, no, any argument that uses LN fails. LN is unready, unproven, we don't know if it will be ready 5 months or 5 years from now, and even when it will be "ready" we don't know if it will manage to fix anything at all.

But in either case it'd be good if you keep both a Segwit and a Standard Electrum wallet.
The Segwit wallet in Electrum uses 'bech32' addresses which is the most recent and most advanced address format -- though you can send *from* it to any address, it's possible some exchanges etc, won't yet know how to send *to* it -- so in those cases you'll have to use the Standard wallet to receive bitcoins.

It's failing at one of its stated goals as expressed in the white paper, namely being used for cheaper transactions than permitted under the traditional paying systems.
It's failing as seen by *fewer* businesses enabling it as an option than they once did, e.g see Steam dropping support for it.

The problem seems to be that significant development effort is required to implement Segwit, something that non-programmers had no way of knowing, but perhaps the programmers that pushed Segwit should have.
Either way, whatever the reason for Segwit's failure to increase the blocksize sufficiently, the bottomline is it has failed. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:44:14
Shouldn't you get banned for promoting an altcoin? You are actually telling people to abandon BTC and use BCH, when I received a temporary ban for less, for merely treating BCH equally.
Ah, but you telling people to use BCH and abandon BTC in an insulting manner because you hate BCH. That's what makes it more acceptable than people who'd advise switching to BCH in a serious and honest manner because they like it.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:12:20
See 


The problem is that when you use addwitnessaddress, the wallet explicitly imports that address. This means you either need to create a wallet backup after every new address, or risk not finding transactions after a restore.  
In the next version we plan to have a configurable address type (legacy, p2sh, bech32), which works correctly with backups. At that point, it will also be safe to enable from the GUI.
So no, it's not just GUI support that is missing.

How many inanities can you pack in one sentence?
"Companies"? Why do you speak just about the benefit to companies, rather than the benefit to all the users that have to use the services of those companies?
"socializing their costs to volunteers running full nodes"?
What are you talking about. How do companies or even ordinary users benefit in the issue of fees from 'volunteers running full nodes'? They don't. What do volunteers running full nodes have to do with anything in the first place?
I'm talking about companies and users that would benefit just from *miner* software being updated. Instead Segwit demands that all client software also gets updated, and the network sees a benefit only proportional to the extent that the entire infrastracture gets updated.
In short we get more cost for the same benefit. Segwit would make absolutely no sense at all if it was about a blocksize increase.
Segwit was a softfork so that companies and users wouldn't have to update, and surprise-surprise companies and users therefore don't feel the need to update.

What about it? I specified "European History" btw, and none of the countries you mentioned is in Europe, but let's examine what you're saying anyway. America is an imperialist, but let's look who it has attacked in the past 15 years (or in Syria's case been itching to attack):
- Yugoslavia, the mass murderer of the Balkans, the country who had just recently attempted conquest of parts of Bosnia and Croatia, committing ethnic cleansing and genocide there, and already in a ethnic conflict between Albanians and Serbs.
- Afghanistan, one of the most brutal dictatorships in the world, and the base of Al Qaeda.
- Iraq, the invader of Kuwait, the mass murderer of the Kurds &amp; Shia, and one of the most brutal dictatorships in the world.
- Libya, one of the most brutal dictatorships in the world, and already in the midst of a civil war that took more dozens thousand lives.
- Syria, the oppressor of Lebanon, and one of the most brutal dictatorships in the world, and already in the midst of a civil war that took more than a hundred thousand lives.
In comparison which country has Ukraine been oppressing? Or can you really pretend it's among the most brutal dictatorship in the world and claim you're overthrowing its leadership for the Ukrainian people's own sake? And unlike the case with Libya and Syria there was no "civil war" in Ukraine until Russia meddled.
So, yup, sorry, but as I said you need go back to World War II and Hitler's invasion of Poland before you find an action in European History more blatantly villainous than Russia's aggression against Ukraine.
Russia meddled How many thousands (hint none) did the civil war of are you really gonna say that Ukraine has been even in the same order of magnitude where tyranny and oppression is concerned?


Commanders with Russian citizenship leading soldiers with Russian citizenship, using Russia-provided guns and Russia-provided tanks, under Russia's instruction, going into another country's territory without its permission in order to take it over in the name of mother Russia.

Okay, you know what, let's assume for a sec that they were all greedy, every last of one of them. Which means they hoped to get rich. I'm assuming you're hoping the same thing when holding bitcoins. You're hoping to get rich to the detriment of those who are NOT holding bitcoins and those who represent the current monetary status quo.
So? How does that affect what amount of sympathy you should have for these greedy people? What's the moral reasoning here?
Greed is not dishonesty or theft. Greed is not even being an asshole or jerk to other people. Greed is not even necessarily selfishness, since you may be hoping to amass a wealth for your loved ones' sake.

You can withdraw BTC from MTGOX even without a verified account. I've done so multiple times.
However I recommend splitting your withdraw into several withdraws (a few bitcoins per time). I think MTGoX has technical issues with large withdraws (of dozens of bitcoins) and those delay several days, while small withdraws (of few bitcoins) happen within the hour.

That Gox would be insolvent was something I could expect, that they might even have lost a significant portion of their bitcoins, so that the goxcoins I was buying at half price might be worth say only 75% of a real bitcoin.

Ah, that vague "they". In more concrete terms this "they" has been people like Mark Karpeles. Seeing what preceded and what followed the MtGox collapse, the bitcoin foundation business model has been made clear.
The Bitcoin Foundation receives stolen money from scumbags like Mark Karpeles. In return the Bitcoin Foundation offers a big position to scumbags like Mark Karpeles -- this position of respect and seeming trust provides the scumbags with credibility and connections, which they then use to steal even more of our money.
Once the theft becomes clear to all, the Bitcoin Foundation pretends to be uninvolved and works to dissuade anyone from making a big deal out of this.
In the meantime, the Bitcoin Foundation still claims that it works for the protection of Bitcoin users, but when asked to mention ONE SINGLE FUCKING THING that they ever did for the protection of bitcoin users, only the sound of silence can be heard.
In short: evil scumbags, thieves and conmen colluding with each other to steal money and bitcoins from the average bitcoin user.

He chose to remain in a discoverable address, much like Gox users chose to leave their money in a stealable location.


There's a different between an honest risk of a failed investment, and someone scamming you. In February 5th mtgox support desk told me specifically (in response to an inquiry about my stuck withdrawals) "All BTC are safe, the transaction will be processed and they are not lost or stolen. We are working to resolve the issue, but at this point we are unable to give a definite date of resolution.Please be advised that BTC on MtGox are not fractional".
So, were people taking a risk that they weren't lying criminals? Well, yes, we were. We were wrong, and they ended up being indeed lying criminals.

A "solution" can only come after we know what the problem is precisely -- specifically whether the problem is incompetence or criminality.
The Bitcoin Foundation is staying suspiciously silently about MtGox. That would be itself high reason to investigate all and any connections they have with it -- how much money they were receiving from MtGox, where that money was going to, how much of that money properly belongs to MtGox's victims, and how knowledgeable of the situation the Foundation members were in advance.

Do you realize that probably most the world thinks that ALL bitcoiners are greedy people who are gambling? And how often most bitcoiners have likely been warned that the whole of bitcoin is a pyramid ponzi-scheme or otherwise doomed to failure?
 
Would you deserve a tear shed if someone gets in your house and steals your paper wallet? By having any money in bitcoin at all, you're "gambling".
You may argue that mtgox was an additional gamble inside the bitcoin gamble, or additional foolishness inside the bitcoin foolishness. But it's not qualitatively different. If the latter kind of gamblers/fools deserve sympathy, so does the former kind.

They're in a bind: If they had been stolen slowly over a period of years, then MtGox is guilty of fraud because of repeated statements over the years that they are *not* running a fractional exchange, and that all the btc are secure.
If the bitcoins had been stolen just in the last few days, they'd not be guilty of that, they'd just be guilty of lying about having a "cold wallet".
Perhaps the lawyers juggled the lies and decided the latter lie is punished less (or not at all) by the law.
Unfortunately for them, the blockchain is evidence. If 750,000 bitcoins were moved in the last few days, they could show us the transactions in question in the blockchain.

From a consequentialistic point of view, a person who hurts hundreds of thousands of people like Karpeles did is certainly several orders of magnitude worse than your average common thief or even an average rapist or murderer.
E.g. imagine when large enough theft means people potentially failing to get life-saving operations, or people no longer being able to donate to life-saving charities. Or people that are forced to keep doing hazardous jobs when they could have retired with the money stolen from them.

You can't use "it's contentious" as an argument against Segwit2x, when being contentious means that people argue against it!
If the biggest argument against Segwit2x is that some people argue against it, that's praise by faint damnation. No better argument can be found against it other than that people argue against it because people argue against it?
EDIT: To be charitable: you can argue "we shouldn't accept any hardfork when it's not a unanimous decision", but that's an objection about the process, not an argument against the thing discussed itself. Each of the people saying Yay or Nay must still argue in favour or against  it on its own merits *regardless* of whether everyone else supports or opposes it.


The point is that if in theory it allows us 2MB, but in practice it doesn't, the throretical limit is hardly relevant.


Why aren't they using it? Isn't Segwit giving them a proper incentive to use it? Is there some other problem?

STOP LISTENING TO THE ECHOES INSIDE YOUR HEAD, AND ACTUALLY TRY TO HEAR WHATEVER IT IS THE OTHER GUY IS SAYING!

I feel as if you keep asking questions that don't actually connect directly to the things I said that you're responding to.
But yes a blocksize increase would usually be considered a hard fork, (unless it's packaged in a way similar to how Segwit does it, which allows old nodes to still see the new blocks as valid.)
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:12:23
Of all your paragraph the only proper argument at an object-level is "It's contentious because it is a massive blocksize increase, which many believe is a bad idea for a number of reasons."
All the others are about the process, which (a) makes it feel as if it's about the desire for the Core team to maintain control over what we call 'Bitcoin' (b) face the problem that the Core team has made it clear that they'd reject Segwit2x even if it wasn't rushed, even if they had been invited, even if there was BIP. And "Replay protection" would obviously not be needed if the Core team agreed to it, as then it'd probably mean there'd be only one chain. "Replay protection" is only needed for when it has been decided that there will be a chainsplit.
If you want to convince people against Segwit2x, you really need to convince them with only the first argument -- that the blocksize increase is *bad*.

Since it's a hard fork, it doesn't really matter whether the hash power that moves away is majority hashpower or a minority hashpower, the same thing happens to the core chain: any hashpower moving away means slower blocks until the difficulty readjusts.
Now your assumption that slower blocks will mean the 'death' of the old chain is an assumption. E.g. luke-jr has said  that the old chain can survive just fine for a time with a single block per hour. 
But my point in the comment above is that a hardfork doesn't necessarily equal a splitchain -- if *nobody at all* mines the old chain, there's no split.

Should 10,000 bitcoin users contact them individually 10,000 times? Doesn't it first make sense to encourage in a public forum, anyone who has already contacted them to *share* the information, or indeed to encourage the wallet-providers to provide the information themselves first, so that they don't have to deal with 10,000 people asking the same question?

Segwit replaces the 1MB blocksize limit with a 4,000,000 blockweight limit.  
blockweight = (stripped size) * 4 + (witness data size)
The "stripped size" is the size of the transaction data not counting the witness data.
So if a block doesn't have witness data (doesn't have segwit transactions) its blocksize remains 1MB max, but if it has segwit transactions the blocksize can go beyond 1MB.

Right now it has the same hashpower as Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is indeed expensive in energy, but it's misleading to say "every transaction costs" -- it's not the transactions that cost, it's the 'mining'. And its expense in energy is effectively derived from the rewards, because the rewards are high, the miners are incentivized to throw lots of energy at the problem.
Doing fewer transactions won't make the total cost less -- the figures of 'every transaction costs 203 KWh" is derived by them dividing the total cost of electricity per block by the number of transactions per block.

Bitcoin Cash is fine, but unfortunately r/btc sub is filled with liars, and bans people who tell the truth, so you can't trust any information it gives about anything, ever.

It's not "bad" by itself. It has however some frauds (like Craig Wright) and other liars (like Roger Ver) being bigshot supporters of it, and lots of its supporters used lies to slander BTC in order to support BCH, so there's a lot of hostility against it as a sideeffect of such tactics.
By itself it's fine -- an attempt to make a make a version of Bitcoin which has the benefit of an uncongested blockchain -- because the people who support it feel that the dangers claimed by Core in regards to big blocks are unfounded.

Right now Bitcoin unfortunately has high fees, due to network congestion, so it's not really useful for the transferring of small amounts. 
Some solutions have been proposed (like the 'Lightning Network'), but they're not ready yet.
Until then, you can help alleviate some of the cost (e.g. make your transaction 30% cheaper) by using Segwit transactions. You can create a new Segwit wallet with the latest version of Electrum or Trezor or others.

You don't see the inconsistency here?
If Core are just developers working on bitcoin, with no special authority over it, then you must accept that different developer teams may drive bitcoin to different directions, causing two bitcoins to eventually exist, because of consensus-layer changes.
That's what happened. Both the Core &amp; the Cash teams decided two different consensus-layer changes. Core decided on adding Segwit, Cash decided on a blocksize increase and a different difficulty algorithm.
Hence, two bitcoins.

Enabling cheap transactions is one of the things that Satoshi lists in the introductory paragraph of the white paper as one of the reasons for Bitcoin.

Satoshi definitely wanted Bitcoin to be capable of handling small casual transactions.

That argument sort of *assumes* there can only ever be one 'real' bitcoin. 


I think in that case people would have a better argument saying it's no longer bitcoin because it would no longer be following Satoshi's vision, not because it'd be a 'hardfork that broke consensus rules'.
If somehow the Bitcoin Core code *softforked* into only allowing transactions in a block if at least 10% of the output goes to Luke Jr's wallet,  and yet somehow the coin gains traction and they start calling it bitcoin 3.0 "would it be real bitcoin", just because it's a softfork and not a hardfork?
I think a better argument is that there's no real bitcoin currently at all, because both Bitcoin &amp; Bitcoin Cash failed at avoiding centralized mining (which goes against Satoshi's vision of tens of thousands of miners)

More predictions of Nostradamus. We were being told that Lightning would be ready for deployment mere *days* after Segwit got activated, and that turned out to be a bunch of lies.
We were told Lightning Network would have been up and running already.

Transactions costs, a limited minimum practical transaction size, the impossibility of small casual transactions -- all things that Bitcoin is supposed to help solve, according to Satoshi's white paper.

In the long term their price may drop. But since their scaling solutions works for the here-and-now, I suppose it makes sense for their price to rise in the here-and-now.

No, you can send from your 3.0 wallet (whether Segwit or non-Segwit) to any address in any wallet (whether Segwit or non-Segwit), no problem.
But to send TO that Segwit 3.0 wallet, you'd need a wallet or exchange that recognized Bech32 -- for example Electrum 3.0
You can have have a non-Segwit wallet in Electrum 3.0 too. E.g. your old non-Segwit wallet, if you were using Electrum already.

The moment it was so updated, I moved my coins to Segwit addresses, but up till then I was supposedly among the people who were 'rejecting' Segwit by not making Segwit transactions -- when instead I was simply waiting for my wallet to release a new version.

Your 'bitcoins' are recorded in a public ledger, not actually stored on your HDD.
What is actually stored in your HDD are the *private keys* by which you can have access to those bitcoins -- in the same way that those private keys could be stored on a piece of paper.
But other than that, yes you're correct -- if you lose the private keys, the effective global number of bitcoins is reduced, and you're correct, via such random losses (not just fires, but e.g. people dying without telling their heirs how to access those bitcoins) is expected to keep decreasing.

You're arguing that the Core team, who have control over the Bitcoin Core 'reference software implementation' have special authority over the Bitcoin brand -- and yet this goes against their own claim -- in which neither they, nor the miners, nor anyone else has any special authority.


The soft fork makes an incompatible change too, it's just incompatible in a different direction than the 'hard fork'. A 'simple software upgrade' would not be incompatible in either direction, and those are the ones that happen frequently without calling them either soft forks or hard forks.
"Software upgrade" was the nonsense rhetoric of Segwit2x, it was deservedly mocked then, and it should be deservedly mocked now. I supported Segwit, I do consider it an upgrade, but whether it's an upgrade or not has nothing to do with whether it's a soft fork or a hard fork.

You are confused. More 'efficient' mining technology means the miners will have a better energy spent per hashes ratio, which means they'll be incentivized to spend *more* energy, not less, as they'll be getting more hashes per energy used.

Just like Satoshi then, who wanted bitcoin to be electronic cash, and AFAIK didn't talk about it as 'store of value'.
If BCH enables low-fee coffee transactions and BTC doesn't, that's a point in favour of BCH, not against it.
Perhaps you should focus on making BTC better, or criticizing BCH for where it's actually worse -- rather than mocking BCH for the points where it's better.

The Bitcoin Foundation didn't "have problems", they were from the start a bunch of criminals whose business model was to receive money from criminals like Mark Kerpeles and in turn they supported and provided respectability for those criminals.
They never had anything to say about MtGOX stealing people's money. Literally they never fucking said anything, before during or after. Not a single announcement was posted about it back then. 
They never had *any* positive role to play in securing users of bitcoin, the BF are merely a criminal gang.

Segwit is a new type of transaction by which the signatures for the inputs (the 'witnesses') are put in a new location in the transaction, the 'witness block', segregated from the rest of the transaction.
This has the advantage of making the transaction id 'unmalleable' -- the transaction id can no longer be modified by an attacker. This was the primary reason for Segwit's existence.
However as a side-benefit and since the 'witness block' had become a feature, and since we want transactions to have many inputs and few outputs rather than vice versa (to reduce bloat of UTXOs, Unspent Transaction Outputs), a 'discount' was decided to also be added to the bytes of the witness block (which represent the inputs).
This was done by introducing a new metric to replace blocksize, the "weight" with blockweight limit 4,000,000 which is calculated as ('stripped size' * 4 + (witness size) * 1). The 'stripped size' is the size of the transaction minus the size of the witness.
This by itself also has as a side-effect that more Segwit transactions than normal transactions fit per block, increasing the blocksize.
So benefits to Segwit:  
(1) Fix to malleability  
(2) Discount for inputs vs outputs  
(3) More Segwit transactions fit per block than non-Segwit transactions, due to the above discount, making them cheaper.
Anyone who begins discussing Segwit with the third benefit, is utterly misunderstanding Segwit, and could just as well be arguing for simply bigger blocks, like the Bitcoin Cash people. The "cheaper" Segwit transactions are the side-benefit of a side-benefit, the main drive for Segwit was the malleability fix.

No, when people need to communicate, they need to fucking be able to use terms that will get the other person to understand what they're talking about. You can't use "bitcoin vs shitcoin" when the two sides disagree which is which.
But if you use "Bitcoin Cash" and "Bitcoin Segwit2x" and "Bitcoin Core", everyone knows what chain you're talking about, no matter what chain they or you support, without the need to even *know* what chain they or you support.
And that should be the point of words -- to get the other person to understand what you're talking about.

That has two answers:
(1) That's  because Satoshi hadn't discovered the malleability bug. If he had discovered it, he'd have implemented something like Segwit himself.
(2) Depends on whether you think the EDA to be more significant in its impact than Segwit, which does seem to me to be the case, as the EDA causes Bitcoin Cash to oscillate between one block every few hours and one block per minute.

Segwit makes more transactions fit in a block by replacing the blocksize limit with a blockweight limit, and treating the Segwit Witness data as weighing less.
Not by actually "stripping" anything. The "stripping" of the witness data only concerns old unupdated nodes, and it's how it's made to pass the limit according to the count of the old unupdated nodes. It's how it was made into a soft-fork.
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:43:52


The message wasn't signed, it was just posted in a forum using Satoshi's account. The account is considered possibly compromised.
Secondly, the real Satoshi would have reason to feel responsible for Dorian Nakamoto's predicament, as Satoshi could have picked a nickname that wasn't shared by tons of real people... So he might feel moved to respond in support of Dorian in a sense that he wouldn't feel moved to respond in opposition to Craig. 
There's been *many* people who have been hypothesized to be Satoshi Nakamoto (Nick Szabo, etc), and he only spoke (if he did) about the one that *he* was responsible for inadvertently entangling in the mess.

1st of all, a miner can just as easily fill a block with fake transactions, if empty blocks aren't accepted by their peers.
2ndly, I don't think we can argue that empty blocks are bad just because it 'reduces the transaction throughput' if we're at the same time saying that bigger blocks are bad because they increase the transaction throughput.
For example I'm reasonably sure that luke-jr would really want miners to be mining smaller blocks -- and in the case that some of them are mining full blocks I don't think he minds seeing a small portion of them mining empty ones as partial counterbalance.
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:43:40
Most of what you said is false, starting from the very first sentence.


No they don't.


No, transaction fees are now a function of satoshis per weight unit.
Segwit transactions cost less by having less 'weight' not by having less bytes.


Again false. They allow more transactions per block, but by weighing less, not being smaller.

That diagram tries to pack in as many deceits as it can. By keeping the Segwit2x the same color it wants to imply that it's Segwit1x that is 'forking away' from the main chain, same way that by changing the color in the Segwit line it wanted to imply that it's Core, not Cash that forked away.
@_date: 2017-10-11 08:42:08
No, I think the rules for the Segwit2x chains indicate that the specified block (I forget the exact number) will need to be &gt; 4.000.000 blockweight, thus ensuring the chain splits at that exact point.

The malleability bug is how any attacker can take your valid transaction before it's confirmed and make some changes that still keep it a valid transaction but change its transaction id.
If you're relying on the transaction id in any way (e.g to identify that your transaction has been confirmed, or to use its outputs, or for whatever reason) this is a problem.
Segwit's primary reason for existence is to create a new type of transactions that cannot be malleated in this way.
@_date: 2017-10-10 09:30:46
If the chains had the same validity rules, your argument would make sense. Since they'll have different validity rules, it doesn't matter one bit which one is the longest, since each will be invalid from the perspective of the other one's validity rules.

I suppose indirectly, if you go to a transaction like 
and you see that its weight is less than size * 4, that means it's a Segwit transaction. If its weight is exactly size * 4, it's a non-Segwit transaction.
Also Segwit addresses always begin with 3. That's not conclusive however because there are non-Segwit addresses that also begin with 3.
EDIT: Removing the need to multiply I see the page above also indicates 'Witness' in the input script section of Segwit transactions, so that would suffice

r/btc banned me without warning for saying "Fuck you" to people who repeatedly called me a "Core shill" and "Core troll", while the people who so called me got no penalty.
In the meantime, anti-Core people can say "Fuck you" to Core supporters all they want, for merely being Core supporters (not as a response to any insult or lie), and they seemingly get no penalty either.

I hate Roger Ver but nobody, whether honest or dishonest, would take you up on that offer.
Buying lots of X at current market rates to show you believe in X makes sense. Paying 5x or 10x the market rate needlessly doesn't show anything like that. Frankly it shows the exact opposite, it'd be a publicity stunt that would show Roger Ver *not* wanting to get the multiple-times that amount of BCC that he could have gotten with the same amount of money.
It's like the idiots who say 'Well if you think Bitcoin will be valued 10,000$, let me sell you a single bitcoin for that amount of money, right now". Well,  no, not when I could right now buy multiple times that.

So, you and Roger Ver were co-founders there, and Roger Ver helped boost your credibility, while you donated money to this foundation, and yet afterwards The Bitcoin Foundation didn't do a single thing to help your victims.
So, why shouldn't we see the whole of the Bitcoin Foundation as part of the same overall criminal operation, receiving MtGox's money and in return helping MtGox's credibility, in order to help MtGox defraud people?

Don't try to time the market, don't try to guess how far it'll fall, or how fast it'll rise again, that will lead you to panic-buy and panic-sell if it moves contrary to your expectation.

If you're saying Craig Wright is Satoshi but wants us to believe he's a fraud, then fine: he succeeded and we believe he's a fraud.
But that also means that everything he says about Bitcoin is also designed with that intention in mind -- the knowledge that everyone believes him a fraud.
So if he's really Satoshi, but he wants us to believe him a fraud, and he publicly opposes Segwit, then what Satoshi is doing is truly saying "You should believe that frauds like this Craig Wright oppose Segwit".
So in short, Satoshi is having the Craig Wright persona oppose Segwit because in reality Satoshi supports it.

I'm not saying you necessarily did that, I'm just saying that's the problem with disposable accounts as the one you're using -- you can hardly create trust in them. They mean nothing because they've after all been created to mean nothing.

That is hyperbole. I'd say you are e.g. quite reasonably certain that the price will not reach 1,000,000$ or 100,000$ or even 50,000$ in the next month. But you're less sure about whether it'll reach 900$ or 1000$ -- this *already* means you're assigning a higher probability to some price ranges than others; even if you're not consciously thinking about it.
It also means you have some numerical bound which you are almost completely certain will not be reached by year's end. It may not be explicitly stated in your mind, but it exists atleast fuzzily.
Then if you *truly* thought  that any value between 0$ and *that* boundary is equally likely, then you would assign probabilities according to the width of each range. (so a range of 1001-2000 would have ten times more likelihood than the range between 701-800, as it covers ten times more numbers)
But what people generally mean when they they "have no idea what the price will be" is that they don't know which direction it will go. In which case you would assign probabilities in decreasing manner as the range moves away from the current values.
 That's roughly what I did. I believe a value of &lt;$350 quite unlikely, and likewise a value of &gt;$2000. Those have low probabilities for me. Ranges in between are more likely.

- like the fluctuations and be a day-trader, each single day seeking to buy low and sell-high

Two weeks ago was November 23rd. The price of BTC in mtgox was in the low 800s.

Even the December 1 mini-crash quickly recovered.
So, I'd say, it's just the last 2-3 days which have been seeing a downward trend, mainly because of the bad news from China.

It seems to me to have mirrored them all. All the graph shows is a price going very up and then going very down. Then the graph adds a couple minor waves before and after the crash, so that you don't notice how generic it is -- but you're the one doing the patternmatching, not the graph.

I think we already had the april-esque collapse a week ago, when the price went from 900$ to below 500$?
We're currently in the post-collapse fluctuations, and as in 2011 and April 2013, each time it seems to "collapse" to a price far above the previous plateau.
 
Each time the collapse also seems to be smaller, and to recover faster. (2011, it collapsed from 32$ to 3$ (to one-tenth the value) and took two years to recover. April 2013 it collapsed from 260$ to 60$ (to about one fifth the value)) and took half a year to recover. November 2013 it collapsed to about one-half the value, and seems to have taken a week to recover.
I hope I'm right in the above and detecting a true pattern, because that would speak well for the long term stability -- the crashes becoming smaller, and the recovery from them being faster.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:05:08


Yeah, that happened 10 days ago or so, when it fell from $900 to $450. Next bubble may be months from now for all we know, and may fall down to a plateau more highly priced than now.

Ok, let me put it in three plain statements, and you can tell me which of these groups of people can be "in their right minds" or not.  
A- People selling BTC for USD.  
B- People spending USD for goods and services.  
C- People spending BTC for goods and services.  
Do you believe that people can be in their right minds when they do (A) and that they can be in their right minds when they do (B), and they can be in their right minds when they do (A and then B)?
If so, why can't they be in their right minds when they do (C), since in both (C) and (A&amp;B) they start out with BTC and end up with goods and services?

Just a few troll messages. Not much of an existence anywhere in reddit outside this. For all we know you could have had a dozen similar accounts, and you wouldn't lose much by discarding them at will if one happened to make an embarrassingly wrong prediction...


Hardly a "warning", those troll messages saying that you're selling for $25, $30, $40 while adding that "goyim" crap (which I suppose is intended to provoke antisemetic hatred). If that price is supposed to be a prediction, btw, then it's a *failed* prediction, as the price didn't drop to that low a number.
Mind you, I'd not be surprised if you're for real and you have indeed not been using other accounts to make different predictions. But alas we just can't know for sure: throwaway accounts just don't mean shit where dependability is concerned.
I don't expect everyone in the internet to want to use their real names, but a single consistent stable internet identity means that people would know both the stuff you got right and the stuff you got embarrasingly wrong.
Anyway people like me who stuck to bitcoin then rather than "selling everything" and "getting out NOW" have amassed a small fortune with Bitcoin's rise since April. Right now I *have* sold, and do hope for the price to go down further before I buy back in (I sold at the $700-800 range, alas, rather than &gt; $1000 -- so I do wish I had read and believed you), but I'd be very suprised if it goes anywhere to the price-range you indicate. my best hope for $500 or so, though I fear that the $700 neighborhood may very well have been the bottom and I won't get any cheap bitcoins...

It didn't crash at $10, it didn't crash at $100, (it has crashed at $35, $260, $900 instead) why in the world should it have crashed at $1000?
Sell orders at $1000 would mean that it'd be difficult to exceed $1000, not that the price would start falling at that point.

Technically yes, but *given* human subjectivity, there exist objects which directly satisfy human needs and desires (food, drink, shelter, art, sex), and objects whose usefulness lies in making it possible to obtain the previous (money) and possibly also because of some social expectations (the value of a dollar is as much and as little as what people think it is).
This is a quite clear distinction.

Donations *should* be shouted from the rooftops, so as to encourage other donations, and so as to help create a culture where donating to charities is the norm.

Let's say I receive 10 bitcoins from you and that I'm contractually obligated to give you back 11 bitcoins a month from now.
Upon receiving the bitcoins, I sell them for USD dollars. Once the month is complete, I buy 11 bitcoins using USD dollars and send them to you.
If the price of the bitcoin in USD has gone down, I'll have made a profit. If the price has risen, I'll have lost money.
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:02:22
How it would probably go instead:  
- You buy a bitcoin at 10 AM at $750  
- The price at 11 AM has fallen at $730. You panic sell, thinking it will keep dropping.  
- The price at noon has risen at $810. You realize the previous sale was a mistake and thinking it will shoot up to $1000, you panic-buy at $810.  
- The price returns to $750
End result: you've actually spent $830 (with trading fees closer to $840 or more) to have a bitcoin now priced at $750.

Obviously both advertising the *need* of donations, and advertising the *practice* of donations should happen, if we want people to donate.


johnnyhammer bashed a person for saying he donated 5 btc and encouraging others to do the same, so I don't what you're referring to.

@_date: 2013-12-24 14:04:06


And I'm just stating you should think a simple question: Do you believe that a person X saying they donated to a charity makes other people (a) more likely or (b) less likely to donate to the charity?
If it's (b) then obviously a person X shouldn't say it. If it's (a) then obviously they *should* say it.
From everything I've seen and read, I believe that (a) is what happens, as a matter of human psychology. If that's indeed the case, your "matter of taste" is utterly irrelevant: a person should advertise the donations they make, even if that invites the scorn of the people from "where you come from". Because their true purpose should be to support the charity, not avoid your scorn.

Doesn't work that way. Consider osmosis. Three vats and two filters: one between national currencies and bitcoin, another between bitcoin and alternate electronic coins.
Everyone who holds national currencies and hears about electronic currencies will hear about Bitcoin first. Alternate currencies will be heard about only after Bitcoin.
So with the movement being "Paper-money--&gt;Bitcoin--&gt;other electronic currencies", other electronic currencies will remain smaller than Bitcoin, UNLESS they start becoming popular in their own right (NOT as a better alternative to Bitcoin), OR unless Bitcoin reserves actually outgrow national-currency reserves.
But as long as the movement is "national currency--&gt;bitcoin--&gt;other electronic currencies", bitcoin has the vast advantage because it has the huge pool of national currency owners to recruit from, while other electronic currencies have the small pool of bitcoin owners to recruit from.
Something similar is the case with adoption of conlangs, like Esperanto and Ido. Ido is superior to Esperanto in pretty much everything, but Esperanto recruits among the speakers of national languages, while Ido recruits only among Esperantists. The rules of osmosis suggest that therefore Esperanto will always have a much greater population base than Ido.

I understand that paper wallets have the issue that you need to transfer away all the balance at once.
I'd suggest Electrum as a client. To me at least it seems the safest of all the methods I've seen, since you can recreate your wallet (the Electrum-generated addresses) just by remembering a 12-word seed sequence that Electrum generates for you.
Now in regards to your question, the standard answer seems to be "coinbase if you're living in the US". People living outside the US generally need to get registered and verified in one of the exchanges like Bitstamp or MtGox.

That was a nice justification for every burglar ever. They can rob anything they like and it isn't actually burglary, or they wouldn't have been able to burglarize it.

Thankfully, I've never said that. And even if someone ever said that (and I've not seen anyone say that), it's only a trick if they didn't believe it. 


Learn the difference between speculative bubbles and pyramid 


Please, disguising envy as supposed moral outrage is a common trick. And wasn't I among the people who "got suckered in" and "didn't know any better" back in early 2013? So what am I, a sucker or a robber?


Yeah, so did I, for the money I invested in bitcoin. I've toiled at 10- and 12-hour workdays and I saved for almost a decade, and then I took a calculated risk in early 2013 which paid off.
But you're not a person, you're a throwaway persona, so I don't expect you to understand or believe that the people you're communicating with are real people.


Nice excuse. But every sale you advised is one additional trade, and one more possibility someone would buy. On the other hand I've been advising neither sales nor buys, and the only advice I've consistently given is for nobody to spend more than they can afford.
At least you're admitting your primary motivation was in attempting to make the price collapse - what I'd expect from someone who holds no bitcoin and seeks to buy, while envious/supposedly morally outraged at the people who did hold bitcoin.


You've been arguing that the April bubble hadn't yet ended, even though that time it collapsed to $60, a one-fifth of its high, because it didn't collapse all the way to the previous all-time high ($30). 
Now in this crash it's not yet gone even below $500 yet (and I don't expect it to do so, alas) So won't you be using that as an excuse to say that this bubble hasn't ended yet either?
Following this pattern, I expect to see you at around 2015, with the price of bitcoin at about $10,000 or so, saying that the "2013-2015 bubble" never really ended.

It's not a bet: you won't lose any money by being wrong -- and  you'll have information more dependent than mere memory on how accurate your predictive capacity was.
The idea is to write down percentages of confidence, and thus:  
a) See possible inconsistencies in your anticipations  
b) Express your beliefs in terms of percentages, rather than fuzzy "I believe that/I don't believe that" which don't differentiate between 51% likelihood and 99% likelihood.  
c) Calculate potential of benefits/losses based on the above beliefs, and be prepared for both.  
d) Be able to unambiguously evaluate how right/wrong you were, instead of relying on fuzzy memories (the people who were predicting a crash from 200$ to 50$, shouldn't be claiming they were right if a crash occurs instead from 900$ to 500$)

It's difficult to calculate the price of anything without relying on how much other people are expected to buy it from you.
But my own thoughts on the matter are as follows (I'm NOT an economist and am thinking out loud right now, so I may change my mind with further thought or argument):
The primary worth of bitcoin is not as a new "store of value" (it doesn't really do any better than fiat in that front), but as a new method and storage of transactions; currently the Internet transactions of fiat money rely on bank accounts and credit card companies (things like Paypal), which all take fees, and bitcoin completely does away with that.
The revenue of Paypal *yearly* is $5.6 billion. That's not the value of the transactions per year, it's just the value that flows every year into Paypal as a price of using its services.
So should I estimate $5.6 billion to eventually flow into bitcoin every single year, increasing the value of each coin accordingly (divided by 12 million currently), when bitcoin has taken over from Paypal? Rinse and repeat for the other methods of internet transactions (credit cards, bank transfers, etc).
But that's the "eventual" guess, trying to measure how much bitcoin are "worth" just in their aspect as "transaction recorders" -- not the wealth at the end of these transactions. Assuming such transactions become widespread, a percentage of all people will transform of percentage of their fiat wealth into bitcoin just so they can perform such transactions. *That* seems to me to be what will determine the non-speculative value.
