Running a full node is so important! 
@_date: 2018-09-23 23:54:38
Bitcoin mining confirms transactions by verifying transactions that they are not double-spent. This allows Bitcoin nodes to remain a secure, tamper proof consensus. 
If there are no miners, Bitcoin would no longer be peer-to-peer because it loses the decentralized factor.

They will have their own cryptocurrency that you must use. Also, that cryptocurrency will immediately be transferred to cash when you use it. They’re not storing bitcoin.

Sure made a lot of assumptions with this one. 
1) 1 Bitcoin is still going to be 1 Bitcoin next week, even if it drops or gains 10% USD value. 
2) I actually go to a public school in a city. 
3) Drugs are not the only thing you can buy. All my flights are booked through CheapAir and I use Bitcoin whenever possible. 
4) I agree, getting in for huge gains is unlikely. However, this post clearly states the main use of Bitcoin to store money.

Definitely a scammer. I’ll buy Bitcoin at market price though, can prove that I have done successful transactions before along with ID and etc. else. Also selling bitcoin at 15% above market but I’ll need your ID and stuff. Feel free to message me for screenshots or anything else. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 19:16:19
Even with 15% discount, my $90 item was more expensive with BTC, why? 
@_date: 2018-08-02 22:56:45
Gold 
@_date: 2018-05-30 06:41:38
Instead of looking for people that’s selling it, you should create a post on local bitcoins saying you’re buying, and at 99% or 100%. Because if you buy it from people’s posts, you’ll always have to buy it at over the market. But if people come to you to sell, you can get market or less.

@_date: 2018-05-14 23:03:38
I’m not in NYC but travel there frequently for cryptocurrency events so I just knew about that. And I’m not sure how much they charge but usually people charge fees no matter how you buy it, even online. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 06:36:38
Never met a seller that charges the buyer the transaction fee, so I gave only received $100 of Bitcoin when I pay with $100. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 21:34:43
I didn’t know that, thanks for clarifying. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 22:31:24
Bitcoin ATM, there’s one at the downstairs of the Bitcoin center in Soho. But after a certain amount they require KYC. I can also sell if you do PayPal but I’ll need identification and it has to be verified PayPal. Identification is ID matching the PayPal and a time stamp saying you approve of purchase, can show previous transactions for proof.

@_date: 2018-06-25 05:19:49
The bitcoin that you have on coinbase is on a bitcoin wallet. If you click “receive funds”, it’ll be a strand of numbers and letters that make up the public key, which then someone else can send funds to. 
However, if you much prefer coinbase, I think that’ll work better for you. I charge a 15% fee which is higher than coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 21:05:11
By “living on”, that would mean an operating Blockchain network for Bitcoin. Penny stocks do not have a Blockchain Network or Network that allows it to live on. 
Not even going to answer how stupid it is to think Bitcoin CAN reach $0.

Yes I can send it to your coinbase wallet and it would be instant. However, I can’t do big amounts so send me a message on how much you’re looking for.

Fork the Blockchain to a previous block where transactions were not affected by the quantum computer because quantum computer’s quantum bits can only be used for one calculation. But once they get enough quantum bits again, they can just do it again to the forked chain. 
What needs to happen is develop a quantum resistant fork for Bitcoin, in which then everyone move their coins to the new wallet. But wallets containing large amounts of coins from previous owners who lost the private key will become victims of quantum computing.

“Bitcoin lives on”
Tell me how exactly does Bitcoin need a certain price to live on? 
@_date: 2018-06-18 14:24:12
I can agree with that. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 13:54:23
Except that’s not the case. Since Bitcoin is an open ledger system, it’s possible to just fork it to a previous block that was not affected by it. And since each ion could only do one calculation, it’s possible to find a solution within that time. 
But best way to actually save bitcoin is to use quantum resistant protocols and post quantum cryptography.

I have nothing against the technology scaling, and in fact I hope it does. But understand that this technology is relying on something we haven’t seen much of before - quantum mechanics in a world where it’s a lot more predictable. Superposition, quantum entanglement, we still have a lot to figure out. Right now, the current quantum computer is not stronger than ones that doesn’t even use those things. How are we going to figure out where the particles are through entanglement? How are we going to refill ions after each calculation? How are we going to deal with the noise? The temperature? Look, I’m all for the technology and hope one day it develops well enough to intertwine with other innovations, but unlike our modern transistors, it’s not possible to ensure the temperature or noise or level of technology to control ions within the compact of a computer tower yet. And not even in the next 100 years. We don’t even have near 0 degrees cooling in our modern computers. I personally believe intel is going to scale it way better than IBM and Google - but there are inherent difficulties due to laws of nature that was not a present in our computers now.

@_date: 2018-06-18 14:13:09
Sorry I made the assumption that people already know about post quantum cryptography because 
1. There are numerous projects already working on quantum proof chains, including Cardano (ADA). It’s a very popular subject when you come into the tech side. 
2. Making quantum proof keys and chains for Bitcoin is harder than for other coins, people would need to move over to new keys. Problem is that keys that were lost previously will get hashed and stolen since they won’t be moved. I believed this was discussed in Fintech Ireland but I could be wrong. 
3. Temperature and sound is actually a problem for quantum computers. To undermine this is a huge mistake because of how carefully you have to place the ions or how highly interactive the ions are with everything. This makes scaling hard, if I understand your question correctly. 
If it helps, there’s a quantum computing Reddit page in which you can ask about quantum resistant chains if you think it poses a problem to ALL cryptocurrencies. There was actually a thread a few days before if you could find it.

Since everyone is expecting 7000, it’ll drop to 6000.

Coinbase or Gemini if you’re trying to sell. 
If you’re trying to spend it, there’s too many sites for me to list. Purse.io let’s you buy Amazon things on a discount, Newegg, or simply look on this site for over 100,000 merchants that accept it.

What are your % fees?

I don’t think people are realizing the potential of this. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 00:30:52
Depends on how much you pay for electricity and how efficient they are are hashing 
@_date: 2018-04-15 19:25:22
Bitcoin.com is not official bitcoin, go to coinbase.com

He can just go on it and say it on the account right? That’s assuming he’s Satoshi but I doubt it. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 01:41:22
If people are making so much why would a mere $50 fee would good enough LOL 
@_date: 2018-04-08 22:49:25
This is a new one that just happened now.

CoinFlip ATMs do not require any verification other than phone if it’s under 700 a day.

Sure, you can say when you use an hardware wallet you have more control of your coins because you have access to the recovery seeds, rather than have it online in an exchange where exchanges have control of the wallet and is vulnerable to hacks or having your account shut down for various reasons. 
But for simplicity sake, just say when you use a hardware wallet you have full control of the funds in the wallet. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:07:29
Agreed. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 03:17:54
Yes 
@_date: 2018-04-15 19:06:46
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:35:48
What did they say is the reason for the suspension? 
@_date: 2018-04-09 04:02:55
So I wouldn’t recommend this because Binance can take a while to actually process the withdrawal. Usually when buying online or sending to a merchant or service, there’s a time restriction that it must be done. It’s too risky.

The other posts are about nodes, this is not. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 22:52:20
Do you have Bitcoin ATMs? 
@_date: 2018-04-28 03:53:39
LOL anything but bitcoin.com that’s a deceiving site 
@_date: 2018-04-09 04:03:52
Also, there’s usually a message that’s suppose to be sent to make sure it’s you. On Binance you can’t do that message.

The first wallet I was told to use was Bread too. However, they were much simpler a while back, now it can be confusing. 
I will check out cryptogreetings.com, thanks! 
@_date: 2018-04-08 15:26:46
Wow 
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:12:51
Bitcoin.com is such a scam 
@_date: 2018-04-23 00:39:00
Except it’s not. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 07:33:19
I looked at the site, this is a fantastic idea, however, the price of each is very steep. Let me know if you can possibly do a bulk deal for this giveaway. Also, how is the private key secured to make sure that not multiple people have a copy of you’re printing it? 
@_date: 2018-04-10 21:57:28
Hmmmm interesting. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:32:10
You have named the fast, simple, and cost effective way in your question. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 04:42:23
Pretty sure he’s not trying to predict the future but instead using common sense. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 21:53:33
I’m confused to what this have to do with coinbase 
@_date: 2018-04-14 06:29:30
You can message me, I have refs and etc. that can confirm past transactions and my identify. that can make everything safe. But I’ll need documentation and for identity verification. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 04:04:48
So never mind of the “not recommended”, just completely not do it because without sending that verification message to tell who sent it or for what transaction, your money will just be lost. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 23:47:02
Redditor for a day, come on. Nice scam. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 07:16:33
Your sweeping idea is fantastic, would certainly use that if possible.
