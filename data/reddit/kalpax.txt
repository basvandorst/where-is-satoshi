Missing Bittrex for USA. They accept cash deposits now.

I do think that either the Pro tier needs to have an uncapped number of trades or the Unlimited version needs to be priced much, much closer to the Pro tier.

Been waiting hours now on a Bittrex to GDAX transfer. Showed up in the deposit within about 20+ minutes but hours later still no confirmations.

Didn't even consider using an accelerator till you mentioned it. Went to go do it and just now got first confirmation. Probably about 2-3 hours after sending.

I honestly can't think of what CoinTracking needs to do that it isn't doing already or working towards. There's a few exchanges it still needs to add but they are pretty small like TuxExchange. 
Also they have both Android &amp; iOS apps &amp; widgets.
The price structure is pretty wonky though because it's not just time based but trade based so it's based on either hitting the 1 year or 2 year limit first or the 3500 trades. The 1 or 2 year subscription prices would make more sense if with each year of subscription your trade cap was increased. Instead it pushes you towards the unlimited tier. 
I think there's a market for something that is as simple and visual as possible but also very cheap. CoinTracking seems to moving towards the simple &amp; visual but no sign of the cheap outside the free 200 right now.  
If there's something better out there I'm interested in checking it out.

   Bought between 14 - 25$  cashed out at $250, if he waited another month he could have cashed out at around $1,000
