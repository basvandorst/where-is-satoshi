These guys dont understand that crypto represents a better form of money. They love to be cash only but don't understand how easy it really is. I spoke with management at No 5 Orange and they are open to it just need a nudge in the right direction. Their own operation manager doesn't know that they already have a process in place to accept crypto through coinpayments.net

Just hodl man you just invested.. dont expect it to keep rising but its going back up. Every coin will be in profit unless they fail to deliver on promises. The mcap of crypto is headed to 300 billion in short term so you will make alot more in those alts than with btc alone. Stick with what made to invest and hodl stay true to your guns. Blockchain is not a fad.

Nice one. I think the information being on the blockchain would allow for all sorts of independent rep systems to be created. The one i have on onchain as reference and simple inplementation is a simplr average of every feedback rating that buyers sellers and arbiters make once a sale is completed. It is backed by consensus so actors cannot multi vote and others cannot vote on others sales.

I've dedicated last few years developing this very notion.
I've followed through his vision to create an e-commerce market on the blockchain. 
A special pruning mechanism reduces bandwidth requirements (avoid hashing data and remove it after it expires), incipiently it links to decentralized identities so everything done in the marketplace is done by identities and it follows suit that reputation is derived as well as based on ratings done by actors post sales activity. Many other things that make an immutable decentralized marketplace an attractive "killerapp" use-case, for example being able to use Bitcoin as a payment option on the marketplace to enable the largest community to benefit from the technology.
The core API is functional as of recently but the Web version comes out in beta in a few days. I look forward on having Bitcoin users use their coins on an actual decentralized marketplace that is dependable and not required to entrust users to host your offers like it is with a p2p marketplace.
