I knew I didn't like him, even before I saw he wore airpods..
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:47:06
He was on the committee to get futures for starters, oh wait.  
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:34:10
Exactly.  The other thing to realize.. Is if he had 10,000 btc, in all likelihood he would have sold at $1million.  Most did the same.  100 or 1000x gains are rare and it would have been a solid trade.  The few that hold on to 10's of millions of BTC are either already rich or lost them.

Thanks. Couldn't tell, but I was moving a decent AMT and it made me uptight.  Figured I'd share my experience. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:07:11
Did I say that?  Senate hearing seemed ok.  Being part of something like futures where everyone who knows anything knows futures have artificially kept gold from rising in order to keep fiat pumping into equities.  No place to run.  The fact that he could even stomach being listed in a "committee" or working group with the same people doesn't pass the stink test.

Usually the last point is the entire point of the speech. Like an oh yea, this is something I want to bring up.... without raising alarm bells, etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:35:28
Wasn't the point. He was a figure head representative for Bitcoin community and sold out. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:02:37
Seriously.  Whenever I see Bcash going up I feel sorry for the people solely driven by price given it's shady premise. We are all in it to make money, but also because I think we see the value of these coins too.

You gotta dig the rally tied off with the little jig he does at the end.

Yep.  Lots of people in US stock market missed out huge over past 10yrs waiting for the one that never happened.  DCA is your friend.

GDAX has cash accounts.  Why is this a problem if you are already on GDAX.  Bigger problem is if you are on a wallet and want to move to GDAX then take to USD.  Or am I missing something here?   
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:00:04
Same.  Unfortunately.  Most are weak hands and sell after they made a few k and regret it and don't care to discuss.

Ripple is a crutch for banks. Why do I need a crypto swift replacement when I can send millions myself to anyone.

Here’s a secret. $8000 USD means little in Yuan, JPY, Euros, Rupees, etc.

Doesn't this open door for govt regulators claiming they need to protect investors?  Perhaps by stating they need to work with compliant exchanges etc?  Someone also said certain sites don't report trades from sites that allow naked shorts to protect the price integrity. Think it was coinmarketcap.  
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:55:37
Real conundrum is cashing out to fiat and having a taxable event vs. hodling.  Maybe sell your car  and convert to BTC.  
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:56:31
Agree..  you have a chance to raise awareness to the upcoming generations.  Consider reading about some of the macro reasoning behind Bitcoin. This article isn’t a great start. Written by someone as smart as you back in 2011. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 05:08:07
Something about exchanges not reporting prices from other exchanges that allow non secured derivatives is a promise/hope
@_date: 2017-11-01 05:11:40
Yes.  Plus have pure exchanges and sites like cryptocompare only price from those exchanges that don't allow naked shorts.

Let's not forget non-hodlers will not be able to go ex-div ala BCH/BTG. Maybe forks are good to keep big money honest. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:33:16
BTG is even &gt; Bcash In my book. GPU mining of a Bitcoin fork intrigues me.

Better yet. Think bigger.. IOTA for machine to machine data sharing and payments. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:57:40
Exactly.  Other person with keys likely won't think of boosting fee and you should do $50 or $100 to be way infront of his $5 fee.

Talking abt mkt cap is silly anyway. Should be termed, “blockchain value” or “investment interest” or “m2 money supply ratio” Mkt cap connotes a aquirable cost where nobody does with utilities or commodities.

I can’t see Bezos wanting the potential government friction. That said, if it does come true then I’ll double my hodlings

Saying someone is missing the point is the weakest way to prove your argument and is also passive aggressive.  Just say your a dumb fuck rather.  
Fwiw. McAfee just bought 2000 S9 antminers and i asked what ROI model he used to justify spending $5m on hardware vs buying that in BTC. He said don't respond, but I dobt think the ROI is there just seeing on S9 mines about .15/Mon and depreciates 15% a month.  
@_date: 2017-10-20 03:19:47
Same. Even then though the cpu wasn’t nominal.  Needed Linux box, etc. and the accounts were a pain. Chances are you would’ve punted sooner than later, erased  the HD, or sold them for 300.  The ones that forgot they had them are the ones who wound up making bank. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 03:23:32
Coinbase let’s you auto rebuy weekly, monthly, etc. good for averaging in

The thing that is different is the adoption rate is going parabolic while coin production is dropping as we speak. to where only 2m or so of the 21m total coins ever produced will be produced. We are currently around 17m coins avail. In the next 4 years only 2 million or so will be produced then it dries up to 2 million over next 20 years!
And wait.  Also something like 2 million coins are lost for good or eternally idle. Satoshi has 1m that haven’t moved and are suggested to have lost keys...

Hell - I blame the banks for keeping me from making millions in crypto!  Back in the day I tried to get them to do an international wire to Kraken and they botched it up twice.  
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:33:23
So which rolling window best fits the mkt cap and os this relevant. Seems btc is currently undervalued based on 180 day. Is that correct?
Second, I feel this needs to be modified to account for decreasing coin growth rate. Idk though. Just seems if tx is growing and coin production is decreasing it could be tuned a bit.

What will happen?
Bitcoin will take over as the currency of the internet. It will also take over as a store of value; why earn a measly, less-than-inflation interest rate in a savings account when you can have steady appreciation of value if you just keep your money in bitcoin? People will spend less and save more because they know if only they do that, they will be richer in the future. Companies will no longer produce things of no value, because no one will buy them. The world will become more efficient, because there will be less waste. Everyone will realize how much they lose by spending money on valueless things. There will be a more equitable distribution of wealth, because no one can inflate (or, to use a less charitable term, counterfeit) bitcoin at their whim. 
Bitcoin will also take over any fiat currencies that inflate too rapidly (think Zimbabwe, Argentina, or any other country that presently has or will have a rapidly inflating currency). Central banks will be under enormous pressure to stabilize their currencies or become obsolete. Many banks will collapse. Many fiat currencies will become worthless. Probably, all fiat currencies will become worthless eventually, because it is only a matter of time before the central banks fall into the temptation of inflating their currencies just a bit too fast. 
Excerpt from:

What’s rivetingis after spending 2 week’s in Germany, how the Country has designed itself to manage the “bottom line” vs. the US is all top line growth where us citizens are the human GDP vehicles to get there. Big house = big loan, oversized food/ drink = obesity = health problems = drugs = hospital care = insurance.  It goes on and on.
Nothing is more satisfying than financial freedom and I think the ideology of Bitcoin, can make that a reality for many.
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:33:50
Don’t see anyway Amazon would support bitcoin. Too much potential for government friction. That said, I’d love to think Bezos has the huevos to do it. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 03:33:52
Unplug your brain from current thinking. If you traded forex or currency pairs it would make sense. The easiest way to think of it is like gold in that anyone can buy or sell around the world in whatever fiat currency they use (gold/usd or gold/euro or even usd/euro).  
So now that you have some fiat like USD, go to coinbase.com or wherever and buy some btc or such in said ratio of USD/BTC.
As far as it increasing. All I can say is look at google trends, number of crypto wallets created and see that growth and people like you are adopting  faster than ever (increasing at increasing rate) along with the fact that bitcoin coin generation is starting to slow very notably over next 3 yrs. 
Easy to ignore one graph, but two starts to scream at you.  In other words. Demand is growing at increasing rate and supply is shrinking... Note: weigh forks and govt meddling accordingly.

Not sure you understand. Try moving to gdax, it's instant. Then sell at once to USD. you can have a lot of USD there, but withdrawals from their accounts to your phyz accts are limited. If I understand what you are saying.

A lot of reasons.  A fully traceable currency can control and restrict anyone's actions (master key/quantum compute/etc). 1million BTC is about 5% of supply, ability to send funds instantly to fund blackops, prevent other countries from becoming reserve currency.  
Papers were written by NSA 5 yrs prior using unique words and phrases that matched what was said in Satoshis white paper.
