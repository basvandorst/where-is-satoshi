Gemini needs to accept LTC.

I like to watch the price on gdax because it automatically updates the price.

I got a discount on Newegg but I quickly replaced my crypto.

True but I just want to be the one to say I called it. ;)

I don't think bitcoin will bubble forever. I just believe its far from fully accepted yet and it will continue to bubble until it is fully accepted.

Good thing Bitcoin is more famous than ever. ;)

This log graph supports my thoughts.

I wish newegg would accept bitcoin. I'm a little paranoid of tiger direct. My friend bought a R9 280X around black friday and it didn't ship. Tiger Direct claimed it was in stock. He researched why it wasn't shipping and found out about litecoins. That got us into buying bitcoin/litecoin. The story has a sad ending for my friend. Tiger Direct promised him a $20 gift certificate because it was taking so long. Three months later they cancelled everything on him. That sucked for him because his card was originally $300 and now it's $550. Newegg has never betrayed us like this. Did anybody else have this happen around black friday?

I already invested all I can. I'm just waiting now.

I was thinking that almost exactly that myself.

Litecoins are becoming more and more solidified every day. I really don't see either falling out of the race. I'm keeping a close eye on what I have. If there's any bad news I can quickly switch to bitcoin. That's one thing I can rely on.

There is a small chunk missing from the top left corner of that Bitcoin.

I clicked your link just to see if it was the same video I was thinking of. You didn't disappoint.

Years ago most people used Internet Explorer. I used Firefox because it was way better. Later, Google Chrome came out and I used that a lot. I never imagined most people would start using internet browsers other than Microsoft's. It took years but eventually the better web browsers were noticed. I thank smart phones a lot for that.

All scams are equal but some scams are more equal than others.

You're panicking way too early. I'm 90% sure you're going to get your money back.

This cartoon has been around a long time. A lot of 90's kids feel nostalgia from this.

I've given noob friends crypto gifts. I'm just smart enough to keep backups in case they lose them. I fully intend on helping them cash out when they are ready.
