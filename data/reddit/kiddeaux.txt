It potentially could. If there are only a few major nodes with enough liquidity across all of their channels, we have essentailly created a centralized payment structure where major nodes act as payment services. If the entire network functions on the back of a handful of nodes, this could be a problem. What this graph doesn't show is the capacity of each channel, and I'd guess that most of these hubs have higher capacity per channel and will therefore see a large portion of transactions  routed through them.

Fair enough, but the right for major nodes to refuse to route still gives them a measure of power that hasn't been seen before in bitcoin. There is not necessarily going to be a guarantee that a secondary path with enough capacity will exist. I'm not concerned about centralization as it pertains to fraud, so much as I am concerned about the potential capacity for organizations to effectively hold the LN captive.

Believe it or not, I actually can see the differences in color, and my point is not that the LN as it stands is centralized, but it could very easily grow in that direction. After all, without much wallet suport and a work in progress routing system, large amounts of capital have yet to flow into the LN. My concern is what happens when it does.

Frankly, that depends entirely upon channel capacity and what routing system the LN eventually settles on.

Kinda looks like sume hub and spoke subgraphs are developing :/

Not opposed to LN, but I think it would be foolish to assume that all forms of network topology will work.

But functionally you have created parallel systems. The original reason most people invested in BTC before it became a speculative hit was to create a currency that was resilient to centralization, not barrelling towards it. Side chain transactions using multisig addresses aren't centralizing, but once you create a network of them, you open yourself up to that risk.

Why not just use Visa?
