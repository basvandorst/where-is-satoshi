Yeesh. "If you want a functional currency, don't use our product."

I'm running on a Raspberry Pi 3 right now, matter of fact. My laptop can run it next year. 
And I can validate all the transactions, very important part of trusting a crypto-asset.
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:02:17
Trustless too; the Lightning Network requires trusted third parties to not go offline. If they go offline, transactions get settled on chain, for a fee of $$$.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:01:31
You wait a week for the transaction to timeout, AND pay the layer 0 fee to withdraw your Bitcoin. Fees are $15 today, $100 next year? Insanity.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:27:07
Check out my analysis above: $0.00000001 for storage, $0.00000005 for bandwidth per transaction. Big blocks here we come!
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:26:13
1GB of RAM is about $5, and 10mbps is $30/month. WAY cheaper than transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:26:06
It's a big red flag when secure software has a high complexity.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:29:12
Let's try and fill up the blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:09:23
Easy peasy, I can do that for two years before I fill up my $120 6TB drive. In two years, imagine the cost of storage. That's just 60 transaction fees worth today.
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:02:59
Yes, this environment is making me very uneasy with BTC and BCH. I've expected Thanksgiving through New Years to be dramatic. I think the legacy system doesn't want to see "Bitcoin up 10x" on New Years Day. (I may have written this before).
If people don't withdraw their Bitcoins, we may be running on false reserves overall. So disappointing!
Don't know what to make of the "change in attitude" towards BCH. It's certainly not showing in the exchange rate, which slipped below BCHBTC 0.13.

We have to hide ourselves to prevent harassment.

A 100MBps 128GB flash drive for $25.
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:05:36
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:20:26
Bandwidth is even cheaper, 20 million transactions at 500 bytes is just 10GB a day. That's four hours of Netflix at 4K (5 mbps). Every modern household can do that.
Edit: THIS IS AWESOME! BITCOIN RULES!
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:40:06
Bitcoin Cash is a hard fork, same genesis block. Time will tell.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:31:27
Multiply the RAM requirements as needed. 4GB this year is $20, 8GB next year is $20.

Here's me not making fun of Andreas.
Why doesn't he have skin in the game? What is he doing pushing Bitcoin on people when he's not "dogfooding"?
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:01:45
How about we increase it just a little bit, to get ahead of the transaction volume?
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:20:11
BCHBTC up 200% and climbing.
The claim was 10 sat/byte, the evidence was 88 sat/byte, for those keeping score at home.

* $12000+1400 = $13400
* $13400 / $4 = 3350x
* $300 * 3350 = $1,005,000
Why didn't Andreas put his skin in the game?
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:23:42
We're at 60 now, the thought police are asleep?
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:32:19
Bigger blocks, xthin and Graphene. We'd have wider adoption if the fees were still reasonable and the transactions scaled. LN isn't the solution because it requires trusted third parties that act as BANKS.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:04:04
Vaporware that requires 2 on-chain transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:19:18
LN is too complex - 59 page whitepaper, and Bitcoin is just 9 pages. It also has nonsensical economics, like claiming fees are high because mining hardware is expensive.
Computer science - start counting at 0. The timeout issue will happen all the time, because these are trusted third parties - exactly the danger that Bitcoin was created to escape.
My transactions wouldn't clear without paying $100 in fees once. It's awful - and why would you condone a service that encourages overpayment of fees?
LNs can't scale, imagine opening a dozen channels a day, or keeping all Bitcoin locked up off chain.
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:19:00
I want to call you out on this lie. Here's a recent block. The cheapest real transaction fee was $2.12, 88 satoshis / byte. Anytime there are more new transactions than a full block, the fees skyrocket in a blind auction.
Prove me wrong or stop claiming fees are low.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:17:32
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:11:49
If I was selling my storage at 500 bytes per transaction, I'd break even at a fee of $0.00000001.
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:49:23
I thought the Lightning Network was already running? Andreas says he's been running a LN node for six months already.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:51:49
Check out @_date: 2017-12-02 22:25:57
Why not both? Bitcoin grew to this point by having headroom in the blockspace. Keep it up.
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:27:44
I thought Segwit would bring fees down to $0.01 again?
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:04:39
$12500, and collapse before 2018-01-01.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:23:14
Let's look at the costs: I pay $30/month for 10mbps. For those 20 million transactions a day, I could break even at a fee of $0.00000005
You're right, the problem is that bandwidth 5x more expensive than storage. LOL!
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:08:29
I know of a hard fork that has a long track record.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:13:34
Anything other coins can do, Bitcoin can cannibalize. I care about the past history of mined Bitcoins; it is the most invested and most fair history. Anything else is worse distributed, mostly owned by the creator.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:30:33
Try to cripple Bitcoin Cash by filling up the blocks with transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:05:44


Creating a circuit takes a lot of time. Why can't this be done like tapping an iWatch?
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:02:43
I can manage 500 bytes for someone's coffee, no problem.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:02:28
The LN nodes are trusted third parties. Says so in the video presentation by the creators, Poon and Dryja.
Ethereum is also too complex - and look how often money is lost there.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:55:37
Simple designs are critical for good engineering. Bitcoin is simple. Lightning Networks are not. Trusted third party, goodness gracious.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:40:46
Reaching consensus and hard forking, like Bitcoin has done in the past. I don't think BTC is living up to the Bitcoin I invested in originally.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:41:48
Test nets.
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:53:08
Path A) Add a new and smaller transaction type, everyone develops and upgrades exchanges, nodes, and wallets in where code creates or verifies transactions.
Path B) Increase the blocksize, everyone upgrades exchanges, nodes and wallets with one variable in block verification code.
It would have bought us so much time to continue developing LN and pegged side chains, without hitting the ceiling and slowing adoption.
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:19:07
Knowing it was called off, they stopped testing it.
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:59:12
No permission needed! Run with it.
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:32:40
I've waited three years for any scaling, and it never happened. Seems intentional at this point.
The Stanford Scaling event points how easy it is to increase the block size early on, preventing the ceiling we've hit now, while rolling on non-linear improvements in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:33:46
Fees are low when no one needs it, and excessive when everyone needs it.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:07:20
I can run 8MB blocks on my Raspberry Pi 3, $35.
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:03:05
Why didn't they? Seems hard to do. Blocksize would have been easier, and less complex, which seems safer.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:52:35
Saying and acting :)
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:01:24
Could you post a transaction hash to prove this?
I wouldn't pay $1.54 fee for anything less than moving $100. Not useful :(
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:15:15
This is childish.
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:30:46
All I want are lower fees. Bigger blocks would do that. Abandoning 2x made me reconsider Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:43:07
In another timeline, we could have never hit the block size limit, and there would be no pressure against growth. Instead, here we are, capped. It affects our growth, and the value of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:48:18
Fair issuance is more important - and Bitcoin Cash continues the issuance of the most worked on crypto. It's the most fair currency to all - easy to adopt, fairly issued, and doesn't have the risky complexity of SegWit and third-party Lightning Network features. Can scale on chain for quite a few orders of magnitude.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:50:03
But Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin, restored to it's full functionality. 8MB blocks to immediately scale as necessary, no replaceable transactions, same proof of work and genesis block.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:31:30
The Bitcoin blockchain grew exponentially until hitting the 1MB limit.
 
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:22:10
Could be more demand - it's an artificial cap on growth. We ought to be increasing the network effect (Metcalfe's law) to reap the benefits. But now everyone who demands &lt;$100 transactions is sent off to buy a substitute good.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:20:49
It grows exponentially if you encourage adoption, like Bitcoin 2009-2017.
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:35:22
Link to patch, or claim is unfounded.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:53:45
Real 8MB blocks, on a real network, on real hardware. If it weren't for validation and induction, we could never make progress towards improvements.
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:50:09
I decide what Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:56:54
It was called off, of course it didn't work.
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:48:13
I want lower fees because it increases demand for my Bitcoin. I can then use it for smaller transactions. More utility, more value.
I run Bitcoin on a $35 Raspberry Pi, with a terabyte harddrive from years ago.
