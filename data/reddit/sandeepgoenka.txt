@_date: 2016-04-13 15:10:45
Yes exactly. We wanted to make a video which talks about bitcoin as money and not bitcoin as tech. We wanted to focus on its importance and not on how it works. Thanks. - Sandeep Goenka, co-founder, Zebpay.

The company is headquartered in Singapore and registered in India also. 
@_date: 2015-06-27 05:48:56
All great points. Will keep in mind. Yes there are. Remittance both in and out of the country and also internal remittance, merchant payment processing due to low credit card penetration, store of value - all great use cases for India.
@_date: 2015-06-26 13:43:09
Yes there truly was a lot of passion in the talk. Thanks for the comments!
@_date: 2015-06-26 16:00:14
Thanks. The segment on price was my response to one of the most asked question by newbies that is why has the price crashed. 
I wanted to put the price crash in perspective for the audience.
@_date: 2015-06-26 15:27:44
Wow, thanks for the detailed comments. Really good tips and will keep in mind for the next one. Thanks for watching!
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:56:39
Haha, then look forward to bumping into you!
@_date: 2015-06-26 20:00:42
Thank you so so much.
@_date: 2015-06-26 13:12:19
Benson, such comments coming from someone of your stature means a lot! Thanks buddy!
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:55:30
Thank you for the kind words :)
@_date: 2015-06-26 20:32:23
Omg haha! The father of our nation's face is on our Fiat notes. This title is too big for anyone now. He was truly just one of his kind!
@_date: 2015-06-26 14:00:58
Omg! It's Andreas himself :) Since I have a chance, want to tell you that I watch your videos everyday to get tips on how to explain bitcoins.
You truly are an inspiration! Working hard in this side of the world to spread bitcoin love!
@_date: 2015-06-26 13:13:44
Haha, that's going to happen by itself, may be thanks to bitcoins ;) 
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:56:18
Point noted! I do talk about banking the unbanked in India. But yes, I agree, I can focus more on problems in India with the financial infrastructure.
@_date: 2015-06-26 16:01:47
I loved this presentation of Wences.
@_date: 2015-06-26 15:30:18
Yes we totally do. We think of ourselves more of a stepping stone for new users. So Zebpay provides some if not all the advantages of bitcoins. 
We also keep evaluating how we can provide the same user experience while keeping the private keys on the users mobile. Hopefully we shall crack that in future. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:53:14
That's exactly the plan!
@_date: 2015-06-26 14:10:54
Thanks for watching the video and your comments. 
I agree that devaluation is not exactly inflation. However the end result for the citizens is the same, a reduction in purchasing power / increase in prices.
@_date: 2015-06-26 16:00:32
Lol! Got it!
@_date: 2015-06-27 05:40:17
Yes please do, its very important that bitcoin awareness spreads in our country.
@_date: 2015-06-26 20:11:58
Haha, omg the meaning is:
What a wonder money is!
Why you keep doing money, money! (guy telling a girl)
Why are you ready to give your life for money!
I mentioning that these are profound words is meant to be a satire!
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:52:55
You can send magic moments, which is exactly the way you mention using Zebpay app. Try it out!
@_date: 2015-06-26 14:27:42
Thanks so much! 
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:53:50
Wow, thank you, I am overwhelmed!
@_date: 2015-06-26 16:02:01
Thanks appreciate the kind words!
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:53:23
Thanks so much!
@_date: 2015-06-26 20:00:27
Sorry you felt that way. I agree we have to be very careful to suggest bitcoin as an investment instrument. 
However, I personally do believe it is also that. The purpose of discussing the price was due to the timing. The price had been going down and people who are new to bitcoins and don't know about previous crashes, simply write off bitcoins due to the peak of Jan 2014. 
So the idea was simply to inform them that this is not the first time this has happened.
@_date: 2015-06-27 05:40:35
Thank you :)
@_date: 2015-06-09 12:06:00
There is a market for both. Hosted wallets for people who'd rather trust someone else especially for small amounts for daily use. 
We have made zebpay android and iphone wallet (dl.zebpay.com) for the average person :). Simple and works like Whatsapp.
@_date: 2015-06-27 05:40:26
Thanks so much!
@_date: 2015-06-26 13:27:47
Thanks buddy!
@_date: 2015-06-26 13:06:45
Wences has a great video in which the content is quite similar.
@_date: 2015-06-26 13:05:50
Thanks so much! Bitcoin is legal in India. 2 links which could help:
@_date: 2015-06-26 13:01:10
Thanks for the feedback. Truly encouraged by your comments on Zebpay!
@_date: 2015-06-26 20:01:22
God, I spent 15 mins so that people would be excited about the last 5 :(
@_date: 2015-06-26 14:33:34
@_date: 2015-06-26 14:27:31
I totally believe in the next boom :)
@_date: 2015-06-26 13:47:22
That's my favorite part. The analysis is on our blog too for easy reference:
@_date: 2015-06-26 20:13:19

It's funny you comment on this. I am born in Amritsar and I just visited the Golden Temple for the first time in my life last month.
@_date: 2015-06-27 05:41:05
Sorry about the echo, we did try to adjust the sound in editing but this was the best result we got :(
@_date: 2015-06-26 14:28:02
Trust me, the response on Reddit has been a big encouragement.
@_date: 2015-06-26 05:24:04
Look forward to your feedback :) - Sandeep Goenka, co-founder!
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:55:05
And that's the reason my presentation was titled 'The Future of Money' rather than bitcoins :)
@_date: 2015-06-26 13:39:03
Thanks, really appreciate the words of encouragement. Yes, bitcoin awareness in India is very low compared to other countries. Working hard to change that.
The segment on the price analysis is my favorite part too.
@_date: 2015-06-26 20:30:55
Our mission is to just be a simple way to store a few bitcoins and give our users a way to spend it on day to day things and with their friends and family. That's really it.
In that way I don't think we are really competing with GetGems.
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:55:18
Thanks so much!
@_date: 2015-06-26 14:09:19

@_date: 2015-06-27 05:40:42
Lol ;)
@_date: 2015-06-26 19:53:35
Thank you sooo much!
@_date: 2015-01-20 10:41:32
Yes we totally agree. Just that Zebpay is targeted at non tech savvy users who really won't use bitcoins because of the learning curve of understanding multi sig, bitcoin addresses, wallet backups and so on.
When the number of regular users who understand how to transact using the blockchain becomes a really big number, we shall definitely move to multi sig. - Sandeep Goenka, Zebpay.
@_date: 2015-01-20 14:42:39
We did have issues with mobile number verification with a few countries which we have already resolved. Please check again or else contact us on support - Sandeep Goenka, Zebpay.
@_date: 2015-05-12 13:57:42
Uber is testing cash payments in India. Indian weddings are testing bitcoins! This is India.

You can buy Amazon US gift cards using bitcoin from Zebpay app at 10% off. Download Zebpay  - Sandeep, co-founder.
@_date: 2015-08-05 07:00:32
Yes we do have feedback for a web interface. However, at the moment, we are razor focused on some awesome features for Zebpay Android and iPhone. 
Hopefully one day :)
@_date: 2015-08-05 06:57:50
If you meant how you can buy the Amazon vouchers, then simply download Zebpay, transfer a few bitcoin to your Zebpay wallet, go to buy vouchers and buy the Amazon gift card. You will immediately receive the Amazon gift card code in Zebpay.
If you meant how we can afford 10% off on the vouchers, that's because we buy them in bulk at a discount and pass on the entire discount to our users.
@_date: 2015-07-27 14:40:16
Hi Devam13, you can buy bitcoins from Zebpay app :) and very soon you'll be able to sell bitcoins as well. - Sandeep, co-founder of Zebpay.

Zebpay is mobile only. Your bitcoin wallet is linked with your mobile number. We don't have plans to launch a desktop version anytime soon. - Sandeep, co-founder of Zebpay.

Zebpay users need to use their mobile number like Whatsapp to register and so our users are all unique users unlike may be blockchain where one user can create many wallets. We have a very high percent of our downloads as active users. - Sandeep, co-founder, Zebpay.
@_date: 2016-09-23 04:55:11
Only Indian users can buy / sell bitcoins. All users can use it as a hosted wallet. 
@_date: 2016-09-23 04:54:43
10% users on a daily basis. A huge 30% on a monthly basis.
@_date: 2016-09-23 04:51:25
Thanks for the kind words. Definitely we want to do that. First, trying to get bitcoins with a critical mass first :).
@_date: 2016-09-23 04:52:14
You are right. However, lot of users purchase the coins and move it to their own wallet via a blockchain transaction.

Ask your cousin to try Zebpay (dl.zebpay.com). Its an Android and iPhone Bitcoin Wallet. Winner of CoinAgenda, Las Vegas.
Its a wallet specifically targeted at non tech savvy, regular users. Yes, Zebpay has the private keys as the target is a simple user experience. The wallet is linked to your mobile number and works like Whatsapp.

Try out Zebpay from  It is very simple to use, works like instant messaging apps like Whatsapp. It is a hosted wallet, that is, Zebpay holds the private keys. (Disclaimer: I am co-founder of Zebpay). 
@_date: 2016-10-01 07:29:35
I doubt we can in near future due to scarcity of both mining equipment / chip foundries and also scarcity of cheap electricity. Totally agree re. your second point, something we are trying to educate our users to be cautious about. - Sandeep, co-founder, Zebpay.
@_date: 2016-10-01 07:27:47
About 30% far higher than we expected :). In India, you have to do KYC to get a mobile number unlike some other countries. Our registration includes mobile number verification. So at least 100,000 individual Indian users have done that. - Sandeep, co-founder, Zebpay.
@_date: 2016-10-01 07:25:35

We started late but we have benefit of learning from best practices from other countries. 2015 will be the year when India appears on the bitcoin scene in a big way.
@_date: 2016-10-01 07:26:04
Thank you so much - Sandeep, co-founder, Zebpay.
@_date: 2015-03-21 07:47:18
We feel that bitcoins should make a pretty big impact on 1.3 billion Indians :)
@_date: 2015-03-20 14:13:28
Totally agree. However, in India, people have been afraid to adopt bitcoins as no one wants to be on the wrong side of the law. So although the tech is global, adoption depends on the laws of the country which is equally important, if not more.
@_date: 2015-03-20 13:40:18
Yes as a founder of a bitcoin company in India, I agree. However, on the internet, on wikipedia, the status of India is always shows as not clear. 
We are now making sure that there is no confusion that bitcoins IS legal in India.   
@_date: 2015-02-17 14:26:26
And so do we at Zebpay because it was the best investment of this decade so far :) Read the last line!

Hope you read the last line of the article. You might want to change the last line of your comment after that :)
The post is a satire on mainstream media coverage of the price drops.
