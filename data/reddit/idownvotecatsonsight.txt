These next few days are (unironically) critical for Bitcoin.

Explain how the fuck this works and what it means. If you get the piece in perfectly it says "wow monster eats the image." so i'm not supposed to put it in? i thought that was the whole point.

I get the concept. Just trying to wrap my head around the logistics, albeit prematurely. I’ve filed hundreds of. 1099s over the years but never done capital gains. I don’t seem to recall where I can input the $100 expense. That’s what I’m asking.

In February 2018 I bought $100 of BTC via Square cash app. I sold it several days later for $105. My 1099-b only lists the $105 under "proceeds".
I should only be taxed on the $5 right? How do I file my taxes to take into account the $100 purchase needed to generate the $5 profit. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 01:09:19
Tell that to Square who sent me the 1099.
As far as proving it, I guess I can't since the 1099 makes no mention of the purchase. Which is the whole point of asking the question. I shouldn't have to prove anything. But I guess that's not how it works.

You don't "hodl" square cash btc which I didn't realize until after so I bailed right away.

I need to get about 1.1 BCH onto my Trezor Wallet so I can pay Bitmain for a S9. How do I go about doing this? I tried coinbase but it appears you are limited to just $250 per week? Wtf? And it didn't even appear to have an option for BCH, just BTC. I registered on CEX.IO, but they are checking my documents. Will I be able to get the 1.1 BCH on this website if I just wait out the verification? Or do I need to do something else.

Fair enough but... How do I do it the right way though? If a 1099 is sent to me then I'm pretty sure it's sent to the IRS. No problem paying tax on $5 but I'm just trying to understand how to set it up so I don't pay tax on $105. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:11:31
Yeah and square refuses to do it manually. Probably going to do a CFPB complaint to get things moving along.

This post is relevant to me. Did you churn Chase much at all? Recently open new credit cards? I don't need Chase for any banking needs, but I have plenty of deposit and credit accounts with them to churn the bonuses. I am also a veteran and have the business checking account set up with no fees.
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:07:20
Yeah but on the backend a lot of these banks are really old. Their systems could be 40 years old and it is time to innovate.

Just a noob, but I am trying to buy in this dip. Why are exchange prices such shit? I cannot use GDX because MN. Gemini is still verifying. Cex.io rates are just so bad. That shit just *barely* went under 10k. What's my best option for nearest market price?

Just out of curiosity how does everyone feel on who is the bear and bull of the world? As someone living in the US it seems to me like the price always drops overnight (except for very recently beginning with the morning pump from the gods). So that would mean Europe and Asia are selling. Can anyone else confirm this? I'm probably just looking for patterns where there aren't any.

The irony of them using biz memes, can't quite comprehend it.
