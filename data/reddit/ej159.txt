That will make it a power of two series too which, to me, is elegant somehow.

Bitcoin would be an ideal escape asset for Greece if this were happening in a few years' time: it would be like weightless, spendable gold. An economy could migrate on to bitcoin nearly overnight if it were phased in in parallel.
Right now though bitcoin ≉ gold. Bitcoin is like humanity has just discovered gold but we can only extract at a certain diminishing rate. What's more people are not sure they like the colour yet and don't understand biting it to check it's authenticity.
Give it a couple of halvings and the bitcoin inflation rate will be in line with and then lower than something people are used to, then the game is afoot. 
That might be the right kind of time for when the USD crashes...

I've just read about the suppression of the gold price with North Korea potentially flooding the market with gold to allow them to buy products from abroad.  Perhaps, gold and bitcoin aren't as different as I was thinking...

This seems like an interesting idea. Is there still free gold going? 1Medkv1scGW9hV124ZSF9F7Ut2KE8iYkiM

Has anyone spent bitcoin on this site yet? Which payment processor do they use?

Isn't this a little different than the UK gold auctions though? 
1) The UK were holding that gold because of its value whereas the BTC here are being held because they were seized. The BTC aren't being sold to explicitly raise funds but rather to get rid of them. Would the US government hold on to them if they thought that they'd increase in value? 
2) BTC is a more speculative investment than gold; a lot of people are evangelical about BTC because of its potential to rock the boat and revolutionise so many things. Coupling this sentiment with the fact that it has risen 1000%s in our lifetimes raises the possibility that it might do again.
3) This auction raises BTC's profile again. This publicity and validation brings in more investors. Could this outweigh the effect of increased supply?

Gavin's comment on that article is pretty good. It seems to me to be a very difficult balancing act to keep the system meeting the demand for transaction processing whilst not compromising on decentralisation.
Couldn't DBSS be adapted to remove this risk of miners uncontrollably inflating the block size with spam transactions by removing free spam transactions from the calculated block size? 
How about it is only the transactions that "pay their way" that get totalled when considering a block size increase? This could make it financially unviable to force a block size increase, couldn't it?
There could be an upper hard limit to this kind of DBSS though as well.
(Don't get me wrong, I'm not against free transactions but surely they could be considered welcome free loaders as they are today. [We've got space in the block why not come along for the ride?])

This is exactly what I keep thinking. Why can't the block size limit be dynamic like the mining difficulty?
The blockchain, and so previous block sizes, are common and known to the network so couldn't we just implement a rule saying something like this:
If the average block size for the past x blocks was y% of the limit then raise the limit by z% (and an equivalent rule for reducing the limit too) or something like that? 
What is the argument against this kind of thing? Is it that big miners could force through loads of "fake" transactions to push up the limit in a similar way to how they game the difficulty by turning on and off hardware? I don't see this being a dramatically easy thing to do or to be particularly desirable though.

I just went from having to drive two hours for a BTC ATM to having three within five minute's walking-distance.
Edit: from what I've read I think these are one-way BTC to cash (I will try to verify soon) but it's still pretty cool.

Can't you just use your recovery seed with another BIP39 compatible wallet to move the funds temporarily and then move them bank to the Trezor if/when you get it back?
@_date: 2015-01-06 19:57:18
Am I right in thinking that Gavin's experiments only messed with "lock_time" because he was sort of just reorganising transactions that had been in old blocks and so messing up the block heights?

Bitcoin could step in in future situations like this (probably not yet as the inflation rate is too high). Bitcoin will be liquid gold.

Why not get the probe to use a local entropy source to generate the private and public key pair and then just broadcast the address to Earth whilst securely burying the private key? That way the key would never leave Mars.

What amazes me is that this kind of one-to-very-many wealth redistribution couldn't really have been done easily by an individual in the past. It's sort of like the opposite of a very small tax.

This is an interesting point. The unemployed don't buy gold because gold is primarily a store of value and they have minimal wealth to protect and it reduces the usefulness if that wealth (it's not easily spent).
Bitcoin is a bit different because it can be a store of wealth and a unit of exchange. It can be spent easily (although not in as many places as we would like right now) and (at the moment) legally. Bitcoin is a useful gold for the low paid and unemployed.
With a 2008-or-worse style crash I think we would see an initial decrease in the bitcoin price with people divesting to pay bills (I think what Coin Rookie says about a lot of bitcoiners being young and broke  is true) but after this there could be very rapid growth. Decreasing buying power of the ordinary person's dollar (or more likely euro) could become pronounced. The bitcoin price stabilises or starts to increase a bit with wealthier people moving into it (some from the old gold brigade) and it becomes attractive to ordinary people to shelter their wealth. 
Business acceptance grows and the poorest can start to pay their bills with bitcoin. In time they are paid in bitcoin, completing the loop.
But this is the standard narrative for us more or less. There are two main questions for me though: the law and the timing.
If governments really crack down on bitcoin so that legal bitcoin businesses find it hard to operate, the (potential) loop could be broken and so adoption slows, stops or decreases. Sensible governments could make bitcoin-friendly tax infrastructure and profit from this kind of situation. I think this could happen in the Eurozone where many different governments are bounded by the same fiat currency.
The timing of the next crisis is important too. At the moment the bitcoin supply is growing relatively quickly every day. If the price shot up today to near $1000 it would probably be unsustainable in terms of the quantity of fiat coming in. The real game begins after a couple of block halvings.
If the crisis is too soon then bitcoin bubbles, antibitcoin laws are made and it gets tough. These two things could cancel out though: bubble comes, bitcoin looks good, bubble pops, bitcoin looks bad, no laws are passed as it's not seen as a real threat and bitcoin waits on the sidelines for the next crisis.
I do worry about Satoshi's coins though. Their movement could shake things up.
I'm not an economist and these are just my thoughts but I'm interested in what everyone thinks.
