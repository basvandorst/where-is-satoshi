Don't play the "what if" game. It can decrease your happiness.
Even Warren Buffet missed out the opportunity to buy Google Shares early day. It wasn't even on his radar. He just accepted it and has moved on and still made a ton of money.
If you would always pick the winners, you would be the richest person on planet Earth. Nobody will ever be capable to do that. Keep in mind, that losing/missing out is part of the game.
Keep in mind, that Bitcoin is even still in "beta" as bitcoin.org mentioned ;). It is never too late to take your position in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, ZCash, Monero, ....
I wasn't afraid to buy Bitcoin  or Ethereum 
Chinese proverb: “The best time to plant a treewas 20 years ago. The second best time is now."
Inform yourself, read the white papers and choose your asset, if you would like to do that. At the end of the day it is your choice, if you buy it or not. Imagine you had bought a decent amount  and it had crash to 0$ (losing all), because you've listen to your friend without knowing anything about the subject. Never buy into something you don't understand. I made that mistakes, too, took the haircut and learned my lesson.
Stay strong

I don't get it. You buy the card in the first place to use your crypto. Now you break it because of the FUD.
You will regret it and have fun waiting to get your next BTC debit card.
