Overheard central mother will ban localbitcoins.
Overheard central mother will ban localbitcoins. Like the United States BitLicense. Now OTC market is not enough.

I'm worried if it gets overly regulated, the public will become worried. People in China respect their government more than Americans respect theirs.

Not take advice from strangers on the internet and do his own analysis. Hate to be so blunt, but if it was so simple everyone would be getting in.

You are competing directly with Chinese miners who have invested millions and millions and millions of dollars into optimized mining rigs and have virtually no electricity costs.
I understand it's a hobby, but you will probably have to wait a long time to get anything.

I wouldn't take this at face value. The people surveyed are in completely different industries and might not understand the underlying value. They might just be looking at the price and saying "760 for a digital asset? Overhyped!"

Same thing happened to me. The issue was my card charged a non-US currency (because I'm not based in the US) to my US card.
So I had to find the exchange rate my bank used to get the original amount Coinbase charged.
