I have not gotten into long term testing yet, but I would suspect that the best I can say is that I'm not out anything.

This is a widget I have been working on for a bit. Use is pretty simple. Paste this into your browser address bar.

Makes complete sense, and when I actually get around to implementing it, I am totally going to use that, and I will name the function lf11 :)

And of course, it admittedly doesn't work at all when the market is stable, like today.

In case you still happen to be interested, I actually broke it out into a semi-usable framework.

I have been thinking about this a little. What do you think would happen if instead of issuing a market order at some threshold, a buy or sell order is created at, I don't know, .01% above or below your price? If the price moves too far between order entry and order execution, the worst that would happen is that you would miss your price. Is missing a sale better than taking a hit? I suspect the answer is 'It depends".

I didn't explain that well. If your target price is 100, put in an ask of 100.01. If your buy price is 100, put in a buy order for 99.999.

I have been working on a bot that does just that. It is not a high frequency bot, but rather a lazy bot that just takes advantage of price fluctuation. Simply put, it buys low and sells high, and it works just fine. And the code is dead simple. Everyone seems inclined to believe that trading bots are complex and mysterious. They *can* be complex, but it is still just math.
I posted a proof of concept here:[The trading bot that does't](

When I view the site in Firefox, the BitBooks logo is partially covered by the testing notification banner at the top of the screen. I know it seems picky because the site is in testing and all, but appearances are everything, even during testing. The only reason I mention that is because everything else looks great, and that just looks bad right off 
the bat.
I think you have a great start. Everything I clicked through worked great, and I would buy a book from there.

If you just stick to the buy low/sell high strategy, then there are going to be times when a buy may not be optimal. However, if one tracks direction and trend, one can also set a threshold. For instance, when determining a buy, I look to make sure that the price trend is not decreasing. I wait until it shows that the price trend has increased 5% over the floor, or the price trend has increased 5 times. There are ways to optimize it.
The $35 swing yesterday was perfect for this sort of simple approach, IMHO. I don't consider missing the optimal price point to be a loss any more than I think my wife saves money by buying things on sale that she never would have bought in the first place. I suppose just a matter of perspective I guess. :)

Interesting. I have been planning to add a hard stop, but I have never heard of a trailing stop really. I can see that as a useful risk management technique. I can also see how it would be very easy to over-think the implementation too. Thanks for the input.

Something like that. I am not actually using the trend for anything yet, other than I do not want to buy while the price is still dropping, and I don't want to sell while the price is still rising. I have not actually given too much thought yet to optimizing anything since all this is really meant to do is take advantage of large swings. As soon as the market is stable, this version will be useless.
As far as profitable, I am not actively using a production version, so I don't want to make any claims. The test I have been running is taking advantage of the swings over the last day, and I have more fake BTC than I did when I started. This particular test has me up $10 at the current price (which is 130ish at the moment). I started with $100 and 1BTC.
