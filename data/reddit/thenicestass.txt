Feel free to think that Japan doesn't exist then its legal there and people do use it brooo but it doesn't profit me to try to convince to think my way that's the beauty of free markets, what is obsolete can not compete.

Well everyone once thought that things could be better, that's how human kind got to where it is today. I'm not saying I have answers but to think that there are no answers to this problem is flawed logic. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 23:40:09
No answer for the Donald dollar? You should give more credit to kids these days good sir, many feel the same way I do because many have been screwed over by the old and obsolete economic system. We may be young but we can tell when things are broken, millennials will be the ones who fix what the old world has broken. The environment, social inequality, and a failing financial system are all things that have been laid before us. One thing for sure the old world is what got us here, we won't look to it for answers on how to fix it. Cheers

It was enough to piss on an expert like you hehe  when the world stops changing I'll agree with you

Follow the news closely and you can get a vibe for what direction the price goes. I also have to continually check the price average out the dips and the rises not to mention it consumes large portions of my day reading endless amounts of data ranging from geopolitical to social media ha. It works for me but your method is sound rock on brotha. Spread the word polite, tactfully and directly :) 
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:39:35
Taxes and corporations got us to the level of human progress. I won't doubt that, that being said progress is a force of nature taking us to lands and societies beyond that of governments and corporations. governments like anything else can become obsolete.

Saying increasing minimum wage wouldn't have multiple effects is narrow minded thinking. Some sectors of business would struggle others would either benefit or stay the same. 7 billion people living everyday adding up to over 20million years every.single.day. Unless you can analyze all 20 million years and create an algorithms to predict what each and every single economic choice will be and how it interacts with the other you don't have the answer. Only parts of answers 
@_date: 2017-09-15 02:41:38
It's still speculative, I believe bitcoin through and through butttt anything is possible something better may arise. but it doesn't hurt to sell high and buy low for those of us who can't afford more than one coin. If you wanna convince people the USD is failing make one of [these]( works every time :)

Soo what you're saying is be patient?
@_date: 2017-09-11 07:38:37
I guess I trust people too much to even feel the need for security. I worked at a homeless shelter for two years and learn from my supervisor that 99% of arguments and disagreements can be solved with words not violence. And his mantra proved true every single day no matter how mad or high or crazy a client was he could always calm them down with simple words. We had security guards and police were their constantly, Jeff was more effective at influencing and defusing their anger than the armed guards ever were.

I agree, I read somewhere once that all generalizations are wrong, I just tend to get peeved when people bag on millennials. A recurring theme that is popular among millennials is that division is harmful but diversity beneficial in all aspects of life. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:09:26
I was thinking more on the lines if people had more expendable income then they might try to do what others do with that expendable income, invest it. Investing is double spending which drives inflation. If suddenly more people can afford to invest wouldn't they? That's my logic anyways not to say everyone would start investing. The thought came across my head when I started earning more money and the first thing I thought to do with that money is invest it. If 50 million people started doing the same as me I imagine it would have a ripple effect on the markets at the very least... please point out flaws in my logic.
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:06:32
Yeah millennials suck noodles, I mean they have deal with a broken financial system, inflation, horrendous social and wealth inequality on a world wide scale, a global environmental crisis, a constant and accelerating rise in the overall cost of living, a shirking job market being steadily outsourced and automated and a current political power structure that does not have anyone's interests but their own at heart. Not to worry though! Our education system prepared millennials for these approaching realities right? 
Yeah. No it did not...
I won't lie large groups of millennials are making mistakes, like every single generation before us. 
Those mistakes come across as foreign and ignorant to those who grew up in an older world where those kinds of mistakes DID NOT EVEN EXIST. 
Sooooo before you judge, dismiss and discredit all millennials please take a moment to ask your self.
What would you do in our situation?
How would you feel in our shoes?
A growing number of millennials are beginning to snap.
A growing number are in favor of burning down the old system and starting anew.
Have little empathy, show a little compassion. Even millennials can see clearly that the world is running short on those resources lately.
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:41:15
Where did I say that I desired an increase in minimum wage? I realize fully before making that post that doing so creates additional problems in the economic system. I never once stated increasing minimum wage would fix anything.
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:08:10
Disregard repeated comments 
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:21:42
Rabble my experts have all the answers, of course they have some answers but not all of them yo, that is flawed thinking broo. No one understands all of humanity and how it reacts and interacts, that includes economics. I try to read everyday and have added those names you suggested to my list. For that thank you. But I for one choose to acknowledge my limitations as well as those of others. 5-10-20 years from now new experts will emerge challenging your ideas as well as my own. And what they present will peer reviewed, unless that will never happen.
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:07:10
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:02:53
My original thought simplified was an increase in income increases the rate of inflation because it may lead to an increase of money invested in the markets which by extension would lead to an increase in inflation. Most kids these days are in favor of burning the old system down and starting anew broooo. [why kids these days don't believe ](

Currently you can be taxed and do absolutely nothing about that fact.  The IRS goes to the bank and takes your money. But if people are their own banks how does government sustain itself? If billions of people use bitcoin the governments would have to individually go to each and every person and ask politely to pay their taxes. Why would people pay for things they may disagree with? I don't like the fact my taxes pay for Donald trump/republicans to enforce his policies. Hence why I own bitcoin.  Have you ever looked at the end goals of socialism and capitalism? They are exactly the same. No is in charge of anyone people will govern themselves. (Ideally) the internet is its own checks and balances. If everyone plays nice why would we need someone in charge? Honestly I believe in this day and age opinions are completely worthless, facts are not worthless because they require proof of work.   That being said someone may come up with a weird way to tax bitcoin that no one has thought which sucks but I see the hole in my logic 
@_date: 2017-09-13 16:50:17
Still seems unfairly biased considering your average fast food restaurant pulls 2,000,000 annually and even with 20 employees at 15,000 annually that's only 300,000 out of overall revenue.  But I agree businesses would and do invest in automation with an increase minimum wage. The modern world is fascinating, but for the average citizen it's austerity hell.

Isn't it possible for the wealth they control to become devalued by its users? It's maybe 50 to 100 years off who knows but anything made by humans is subject to change from humans. Simply stated governments/banks are not immutable.

@_date: 2017-09-13 18:34:49
Soooo no more new economists? All theories have been proven? If you'd pay attention I'm actually thinking scientifically, attempting to disprove myself as you. Or philosophically take your pick. I'm not saying I'm right but no one else is completely right either. Everyone has access to information that you and I do not. That includes those yet to be born. I'm not a fan of division among people's.

I secretly wish [this]( will happen. Oops it's not a secret any more. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 22:05:02
I suppose I believe we will see it or at least I hope we do because of the laws that govern technological progress, as well as the realities of singularities that occur throughout human history.  Technology moves at an exponential/logarithmic pace. The more knowledge that all people have access to the more progress we see within humanity. The internet is one of those technologies that grants us knowledge of anything and anyone that people wish to know more about. As far as people pooling their wealth to create things they by themselves could not do, (taxes/crowdfunding/etc) those will be around as long as humans are alive so in that regard I agree with you. I can't pretend to know how roads or police forces or schools will continue to exist if everyone were to use bitcoin instead of fiat currency. Part of me likes to think crowdfunding could play a part in that, if you don't have kids don't pay into the fund or if you want children to be educated than pay into it. If bitcoin were to replace our traditional system I don't believe the early adopters who benefited from it would simply pack their bags and say fuck everyone that disagreed with me I'm living in a mansion. I could be wrong who's to say, in this day and age it does not profit an individual to disparage or ostracize others simply because EVERYONE has access to some bit of information that you and I do not. If they don't have information that doesn't benefit you, that's that it's not worth your time argue with a nazi or whoever. Everyone has value and I like to believe that bitcoin distributes that value far better than our older system.

Who knows if this fact/observation is a proponent behind the driving force against minimum wage increases, I'm sure there is a plethora of forces designed to prevent the collapse of debt based currency some malevolent others simply mathematical.

How can bitcoin be taxed with private keys? Currently people pay taxes on it I won't disagree but if a billion people do start using bitcoin many if not all old institutions and power structures will fail, the point of bitcoin is to be free from centralized trust.  The point is that it's YOUR money no one else has any stake in what you do with it. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:39:17

Bitcoin can have a rabbit hole like affect on those who use it. Basically those who truly believe in bitcoin see it as an alternative to the current system that runs the world. The idea itself is very powerful, money that can NOT be taxed. Who's to say what will happen in the future but for those that have given up on the government or the banking system, bitcoin is their new system.

As long as bitcoin supports the common interests of the people it will succeed, common interest is that life is fair, less uncertainty and more security I scratch your back you scratch mine. If anything the bitcoin community should reach out to impoverished communities and explain the overall fairness and benefits of crypto currency. If bitcoin is described deliberately and honestly to the masses, the masses will use it. In this world of false facts and fake news everyone is looking for honesty. Bitcoin just needs to show people how it is HONEST money.  
Every individual has value no matter how smart, stupid, evil or good we think they may be. Everyone has SOME value simply because they have access to information that you and I do not, (theory of mind) bitcoin is a like virus, spread the word with logic math and honesty so it doesn't look like a scam hope for the best and then go from there, 
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:33:56
When I explain bitcoin to others I simply tell them that I sell freedom and honesty, works every time, forewarning to others  using my method because it literally can cause existential crisis and mental breakdowns in some people...
