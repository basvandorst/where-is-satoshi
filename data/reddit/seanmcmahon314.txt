The comparison is fair. They are both treated as a store of value with the price being justified by the cost to mine and the scarcity. The precursor to bitcoin was even called "bit gold".
I'm not the only one who thinks this way. Here's Peter Thiel, founder of PayPal and initial investor in Facebook:

The price of anything, including companies that pay a dividend, is subjective and determined by the collective psychology of the crowd. That doesn't mean we can't make predictions about the true value of financial assets. If you are not convinced, that says more about you than the model. That's fair. All models are technically wrong. However, some are useful. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 04:16:03
I think it's difficult see. Many of the justifications for the price today are not things I was cognizant of when I first became aware of bitcoin.
How it works is also somewhat (but not extremely) complicated.

People don't realize how hard holding actually is.
"You just bought 5k worth of bitcoin and now you're a millionaire? Pff, I knew capitalism wasn't fair! What a joke!"
It takes brass balls to hodl. From the end of 2013 to 2015, bitcoin lost 80% of its value. Imagine someone with six figures USD sunk into bitcoin watching the slow decay, periodically reading articles from Paul Krugman and others calling him/her a fool with the prospect of losing the entire investment hanging overhead. To handle the stress and still act logically with tact and foresight takes iron will and extreme intellectual independence to not be dissuaded from your decisions by the opinions of others. Hodlers, you saw the future with clarity, you weren't dissuaded by the effects of stress and the opinions of others, you bet large sums of money on your convictions, you were right and now you're rich.
If bitcoin reaches half of gold's market cap in 5 years (assuming that 20% of the bitcoins have been lost) we're looking at a $250k bitcoin. The current price is $7.5k. I've looked at value investing in the US stock market. I can't find anything with such a large disparity between what it should be worth and what it's selling for. Ben Graham's philosophy is that you don't try to time the market, you buy undervalued stocks and wait. This is not a stock; there are no earnings. If a company that paid a dividend was this undervalued, I would prefer to buy that because it would make me rich quicker and with less risk. Unfortunately, there isn't, but there is bitcoin. 
I don't think it's even practically possible for a company with a positive earnings to be undervalued by 33x because the undervaluation would too obvious to be sustained.

I made a price prediction. I used a well established financial asset as a comparison with a 5 year time horizon. What's your prediction and how did you make it? 
@_date: 2018-05-24 23:57:22
I don't think the wash trading and spoofing are really that big of a deal. However, if hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoins were purchased with tether that wasn't actually backed by any usd, that would be a big deal. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 13:16:06
I stand corrected 
@_date: 2018-05-28 13:15:28
It does drive the price. Supply vs demand is econ 101 man. Another way to think about the price is that there is a certain amount of of value flowing through the bitcoin network at any point in time and a limited amount of free bitcoins to facilitate those transactions. Value/free bitcoins = price (key word = free. Hoarded bitcoins aren't facilitating transactions).
If all plumbers faced 10x more cost, all plumbers would have to 10x their price and I would have no choice but to pay 10x if I couldn't do the plumbing work myself. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 04:31:54
True, it's artificial and governed by an algorithm. It's both an artificial and a real cost. You actually have to spend thousands of dollars to mine a bitcoin and the supply growth actually does decrease by half every two years. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 01:19:51
What I mean is that it's no big deal to the evolution of bitcoin overall. It's just a bunch of microscams that happen on exchanges.
Massive multimillion dollar purchases of bitcoin with fake tether, on the other hand, challenge the integrity of bitcoin as a widely invested in commodity.

The upside is bigger than the downside so I'd say this is a good assymetric bet. If you win, you get 40x, if you lose, you lose 1x. What you have to do though is not sell when the price dips because it's guaranteed to at some point and then you've lost it. 
If you buy, my recomendation: don't touch it for 2-3 years. If you lose it, well, you didn't invest more than you could afford to lose and you acknowledged the possibility to begin with. If bitcoin becomes a new store of value like gold, you'll be sitting on a lot of money. 
@_date: 2018-06-17 12:46:58
So, if the tether is indeed fake and they are still printing it, why couldn't they inflate the market again?

Yeah, any jump like that is going to see a large correction on the flip side. 
You can try to explain every micromovement, but given that short term asset price movements are often chaotic and in response to nothing other than random changes in the price, it's better not to.

It's a feedback loop. The price suddenly drops which causes investors to get scared and sell which causes the price to drop which causes more investors to get scared and sell....

In reality, these things don't occur continuously. The large players, if not possessing some kind of insider knowledge, are selling out of fear.
@_date: 2018-11-22 14:06:39
Nope, buy when others are fearful, sell when others are greedy.
Buying in late 2017 when everyone was having a manic episode would have made you an idiot.
Buying now that editorials are being written about the death of Bitcoin is not so long as you have a long expected holding period.

There's no "get rich quick" here. The people who had turned a dollar into $1m in late 2017 waited almost 9 years and experienced 4 80+% corrections without liquidating their positions.
This correction is par for the course so far. Bitcoin could still be $100k-$1m, but not tomorrow, you're going to have to wait.
Like gold, the value of Bitcoin is directly proportional to how much $ is invested in it. 
Affluent millennials are investing in Bitcoin like Boomers invested in gold:
As the wealth of the affluent millennials increases over time, so should the value of Bitcoin because, just like gold, because of the scarcity, the value is directly proportional to the amount of $ invested.
Market cap of gold: ~$8T
Number of bitcoins that have been mined: 17m
Assuming 20% have been lost: 13m ( reasonable guestimate)
When will this happen?  When the wealth of millennials approaches that of Boomers...over the course of a generation...maybe 20 years.
Even fractions of this market cap would deliver outsized returns, but if you're trying to get rich tomorrow, this probably isn't going to work and you should probably stop because there's no easy way to get rich quick.
What'll happen in the short term? I neither know nor care.

Why should it be any quicker for bitcoin?
Investing is a transfer of wealth from the impatient to the patient. If you want to get rich, you're going to have to learn to control your emotions and wait.
The transition of capital into bitcoin as a store of value/inflation hedge/gold 2.0 type investment is going to occur over a generation, not overnight.
The best case for you (not the system overall) is for there to be a dotcom sized crypto bubble that occurs sooner that you know when to get out of (no guarantee this happens; no guarantee you exit the right moment if it does).
Think about it though: say you have 20 bitcoins, you've delayed gratification for 30 years, you're in your 50s and it's worth $30m. Are you mad you waited so long?

The guidance that the SEC head gave just recently was that there needs to be better monitoring of crypto markets and a custody solution.  I think the VanEck ETF addresses the former where the others had not adequately so the odds of this one passing are much better than the others.
