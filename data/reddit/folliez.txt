False, HTTPS can be downgraded by the MITM. Solution is user paying attention or websites using STS.

um, wat? (Maybe in non-euclidean geometries, but not in the real plane)

We're all familiar with the social media alternatives, and we all can agree they haven't succeeded in breaking into the mainstream.
If you read our whitepaper (or some of our blog posts), you can appreciate that we have a sound model that is a generation ahead of the existing social networks - and clones.
If you have any specific questions about the model we'd be happy to address them!

Yuval, Synereo CTO here -
People clearly do care about tech. Bitcoin still is an unusable ecosystem for mere mortals. But the technology behind cryptocurrencies is promising enough to carry real monetary value.
Likewise, we're seeing a large shift in demand towards technology that provides us with privacy, security, and anonymity. Post-Snowden, more and more consumers choose products that respect their privacy when such an option is available - see the meteoric rise of Telegram and Signal/TextSecure over the predominant WhatsApp.
It is very clear, however, that the experience - and possibly experience alone - is the only thing that matters when it comes to mass adoption of new technology. We are quite aware that being able to introduce Synereo to the masses requires significant effort on this front.
Synereo has a very clear vision in mind: regaining control over our data and having the right rewards in place so that we are not giving away our attention to ad-mongering networks that rack up all the profits. Our technology is built to match those requirements, and naturally, the user experience must follow suit.
