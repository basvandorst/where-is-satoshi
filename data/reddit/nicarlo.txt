The thing about the internet is that it's not just about the US. If the github project were to get shutdown (which I don't see why they would) it would move to another provider in a country where they wouldn't have any jurisdiction.
No potential danger whatsoever.

Thanks for this!

Life... it's a beautiful thing. But sometimes it will test you.. It will give you everything and then take it all away from you.. It will punch you right in the face and knock you down to the floor. Trust me I've been there. What YOU do after this will shape you to be the person you are. It will make you stronger, it will make you better.
You've done something with bitcoin that only a hand full of people could accomplish on their own. Know that and don't ever forget it.
Pick yourself back up and get ANGRY, use that hunger, that fire that you once had to take back your life and show it that it WILL NOT control YOU. You will persevere and you will once again get back control of your life and finances.
You will recover, you will live life and respect it. One day in the far future while you lay on your death bed surrounded by your loved ones, you will get to look back at your life and appreciate the things that you accomplished, the people who have loved you and all those that you have touched with your spirit.
Don't be selfish and certainly don't give up. We are human, we always find a way.
Best of luck to you my friend. Never give up, never forget and always push forward.

You are right. No one has banned bitcoin however the talks of banning have cause major market fluctuation. If bitcoin could or would get banned or barred what would be the reasons that the governments would use?

Came here to post this. Damn you guys are fast!
Comments do suck but most of these comments are from people who only know bitcoin from the news. They don't understand it fully. The news hasn't always had a great record explaining bitcoin either. Remember bad news is good news for any news studio!

watching this unfold live.. not sure if it has anything to do with the bitpay/paypal announcement today. Not sure if it's a trap or not yet.. I'll probably regret not buying more soon enough.

Is it worth it for your business to start accepting bitcoin? It cost you little to nothing to start accepting it.  It gives buyers the choice to pay for your items or services with the currency that they choose to keep. You already understand bitcoin so i don't have to go on explaining why more and more people would rather pay with bitcoin. I hope that answers your questions!

Anyone know what the fees are on this machine at this location?
@_date: 2014-06-12 21:41:41
Ah perfect! This is the article i read the other day. Must have missed the "Can't" part!
Thanks for clearing this up!

I have some extra server sitting in a datacenter with very low load. I've already got two nodes running.
One question for all of you though. How would I go about getting a page displaying the stats similar to this 
Would someone be kind enough to message me a link or information on how to go about doing this? Cheers!
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:41:07
I contacted their support and it was an issue on their end. They were able to fix it pretty quickly!
@_date: 2014-09-23 12:49:52
Shoot me a PM if you're still looking :)
@_date: 2014-10-29 04:42:19
What script are you using for the status page?
@_date: 2014-11-06 14:07:17
I would have liked that you had have voiced your opinion on what you like about this btm vs others. What are the pros and cons of this machine, and for what kind of people is this machine not right for.
@_date: 2016-06-03 03:44:47
Have you looked into quadrigaCX?
@_date: 2019-10-16 11:28:19
Thank you for sharing. I hope your stuff gets sorted but i wouldnt hold my breath. Remember everyone, if they could be making as much money as they say they wouldnt need your money to do it!

Same here, got it to my localbitcoin address as well.
@_date: 2015-09-23 21:16:53
This is exactly what i came here for. I guess Forever has a different meaning to some people than others....
@_date: 2015-03-18 22:22:08
There's a few options,
you can use bitpay.
The other option is using Straight-server

I see what you're saying. I know I brought up a company like VISA but it was just to allow people to better relate to this idea. What I'm mostly referring too are things like AirMiles points or in most major groceries store (at least here in Canada) they have a members program card where clients will be given rewards on their purchases.
So in this example these stores would instead scan the users QR code on their keychain which would than deposit whatever about (if it's 10 cents or 30 cents) into their wallet as a reward for shopping there.
Another example, again here in Canada we have a store called Canadian Tire. At this store when ever you make a purchase via debit or cash you will get "Canadian Tire Dollars" back in form of money ( see [here]( )
So what I'm saying is if merchants started doing this, I believe it would spike the amount of new users who own an use bitcoin.
TL;DR When a user pays for a good at a merchant, the merchant would reward the user by sending a fraction of a btc to their wallet
 
@_date: 2015-02-17 18:08:43
This is exactly my thought. I decided to put all my btc into cold storage and take off on vacation and see if they are still around when I come back!
@_date: 2015-02-12 16:03:47
First of all, I'd like to state that I am no Lawyer nor accounting however I am a Canadian citizen that has come across this before.
You bring up a great yet complicated question. Depending on how you used your bitcoins it could be taxed differently. In your case I believe you the proper way is to file it under  as a property
Here are some relevant links that I came up with, you should go through them if you haven't yet.
Hope this helps!

Quadriga is pretty good, ive been using them for the last couple of weeks. I very much like their system and their fee schedule however did notice that they take much longer to do CAD withdraw (but they dont charge any fee) so keep that part in mind if you are expecting money quickly
