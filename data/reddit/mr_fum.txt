I would say that you're lucky that your balance on Mt.gox is 0.  
But I hope you get your coins back.

I would like to quote Karl Pilkington... "Do we need'em?"

I think that you're thinking of the Coinbase leak.
@_date: 2015-02-01 11:35:16
Sure, that's fine to tell a hoarder not to someone who would be using bitcoins as they're intended.  
If you need to pay your rent and suddenly you have to pay 25% more because cunts with lots of money are using bitcoin as their new playground for making money, your log scale isn't helping.

That and memes....
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:00:49
Yeah... I know...
So you think they print out the picture of the ID and it's absolutely essential that the printed ID is 1:1 scale to the real one?  
I say they're simply a bunch of asshats.

Skulle precis ta bort den här tråden eftersom det löst sit.
Jag mailade idag runt ettiden och fick för en stund sedan samma svar, med överföring som nu är bekräftat och har gått igenom.
Problemet ska tydligen vara fixat och överföringar hålls under hård uppsikt.

Naah... I'm more of a laughbaby .
@_date: 2013-11-07 08:38:15
I used to be like that.  
Now I'm in for the long run. No more stress over trying to make the right decision, when to sell and when to rebuy.  
@_date: 2013-11-22 09:27:58
You better hope BTC will be THE crypto currency, or you'll feel like a right tit.
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:53:00
I had the exact same feeling.  
I felt mildly warm and comfy when making the right decision, but sick as a dog when it went belly up.

Are YOU willing to pay $100-200?  
Who do you think is?
@_date: 2013-12-13 12:33:23
Broke it, and receded. :)

That doesn't really help if you have fiat och BTC on the site.

Oh...  
It's looking a bit bleak right now. It's been 5 days since he thought the site should be up and running again and no new updates.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:29:21
is leaking...
@_date: 2013-04-12 08:56:31
I rather see posts about bitcoins instead of cute pictures of dogs just because said dog has some sort of connection to BTC.  
But I guess it's only a matter of time before there is a @_date: 2013-11-10 12:57:36
300 dpi? Fucking clowns. 
An image can be 2x2 pixels and still be in 300 dpi. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:33:29
Percentage wise it's around where it's been for a while now.

I'm waiting for the crash to subscribe.

Does anyone know what this script/spam/virus-shit does?
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:08:33
Is this the one?

Check out the [Order depth]( and tell me everything is in working order. :)

This game is just as fucking rigged as every other game.

You could just, no pick it up?  
Or have you already received the package?
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:38:45
Since when?  
@_date: 2013-12-13 12:57:50
I hope you're right. The way people can star using it as intended and not only as a get rich quick scheme.

I use Vibrams for running or swimming outdoors.

I ask my good friend Ponzi. He said to put them next to the pyramids.
@_date: 2013-12-12 14:23:52
Really? in what way?
@_date: 2013-11-12 16:18:11
Sure, but would it be worth another BTC? You'll never see a ROI.
