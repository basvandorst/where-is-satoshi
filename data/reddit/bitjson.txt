Electrum is a real bitcoin wallet – your bitcoin isn't stored with a central entity – so if you're happy with it, I don't necessarily recommend you switch.
This post is more for new users that might not yet understand the distinction between a *bitcoin wallet* and a website that lets you buy/hold bitcoin. I think the three I listed are very commonly recommended on this sub because they are pretty user-friendly. I haven't used it myself, but [Electrum's android app]( looks pretty good too. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:01:17
Not to my knowledge – both options are (in my opinion) orders of magnitude better than leaving your bitcoin on an exchange website. 
That sounds reasonably secure to me.

With many casual bitcoin users visiting the sub – maybe for the first time in a while – I thought now would be an excellent time to share.

The BitPay app uses Bitcoin Core's fee estimation, but if you're ok with possibly waiting 24 hours or longer, you can also simply set a custom fee from the confirmation view in the BitPay app. (You can go as low as 1 satoshi/byte if you're willing to roll the dice.)
Here's a good estimator: 
Also, it's generally a Bad Idea to share keys between wallets. If you want to move wallets, send the funds properly to avoid exposing yourself to additional security risks.
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:49:01
You're completely right about trust in the apps themselves. It's worth mentioning two more potential issues: 
1. Side-channel attacks which take a while (so they can steal your keys, but they need to continuously run code which uses things like timing to steal keys over days or weeks)
And the real concern:
2. User error. You'd be amazed how many users don't think twice about transferring keys using a notes app synced with Google/iCloud/etc. An unfortunate number of users trust these programs with passwords regularly, why not a bitcoin seed? The average person is bad at information security, but they'll still try to copy you.
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:44:02
I think I'm still missing part of your vision.
Yes, payouts are most efficient when sent from a single input to thousands of outputs. But how do you get a single input from thousands of UTXOs?
Every single customer deposit generates a new UTXO. If you sweep those UTXOs to a single UTXO before making a payout, you've shifted the problem, but the total block weight is the same. Am I missing something? (And can you share a link to any more detailed analysis?)
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:05:33
Just curious, why do you expect batching transactions to reduce congestion? If a batched transaction has the same inputs and outputs as multiple individual transactions, I believe the total block "weight" of either method should be very similar. Is the goal to save bytes from the version and locktime fields? Can you point me to any more information on the topic?

Agreed, though the example you gave brings up an often misunderstood distinction between a society with a monopolistic State and a hypothetical fully-contractual (ancap) society using Bitcoin smart-contracts.
Without a state to ultimately fall back on in the case of disagreements, a "smart contract" society would likely (over time) grow to pre-determine more and more disputes by clarifying contracts. This is simply more efficient and mutually agreeable than getting together in a courtroom and "dueling it out" after the problem has happened.
In your example, I think it is perfectly possible for the dispute to be handled by a smart contract. She is a patient of the physician – they have a contract. The contract either covers the woman on Wednesdays, or it does not. Hypothetically, a well-designed smart contract (with oracles or other data sources) can handle this case without a traditional arbitration. 
Better yet, because the process is predictable and more objective, it's much more likely that the outcome will be fair and meet each party's expectations.


So I'm not disagreeing with you, but I think it's a worthwhile thought experiment to consider that most (perhaps not all) legal situations *can* be solved with well-designed smart contracts. I tend to think that the subset of cases requiring "soft" human judgement is much smaller (and shrinking) than is immediately obvious.
(We could be many years – and a lot of trial-and-error – away from this working smoothly, of course.)

# Abstract
Bitcoin has demonstrated a new approach to securely storing data in the cloud. The Bitcoin database services millions of users around the planet and has thus far shown itself to be essentially invulnerable to attack. Bitcoin does not require boundary defenses to protect the integrity of the database, instead it relies on a consensus of peers to build an independently verifiable historical record. To alter past revisions to the database, an attacker must wield computing power in excess of the combined power of honest participants in network. ChainDB seeks to apply that same approach to securing arbitrary sets of data in the cloud. However, rather than create yet another Bitcoin clone that requires its own mining network, ChainDB uses the existing Bitcoin mining network. In this paper, we outline the ChainDB consensus mechanism.

The BitPay [Bitcoin Exchange Rates]( page provides a lot more detail about how the rate is calculated.
Basically, BitPay looks at each of its exchanges and finds the absolute best price at which you can sell bitcoin. And that's the Bitcoin Best Bid rate.
Edit: To clarify, the BBB rate is more favorable than an average — rather than averaging many rates together, BitPay offers the highest one available, and guarantees payment at that rate to merchants.

Hi I'm really sorry to hear you had a poor experience with our signup process. It can be hard to design around the regulatory regime for payment processing services, and we will definitely be reviewing this issue. 
"Sole Proprietor" is a pretty common designation in the US – if that's where you're located, and you'd still like to sign up, it's possible to [get an EIN for free]( on the IRS website. No specific business registration is required to get an EIN, and many financial services are required to collect it before opening business accounts.
**edit**: I think I should clarify – while some highly-regulated merchant categories may require additional verification (I'm a designer, please us our verification process for definitive information), our Starter and Tier 1 (usually $10,000 annual) verification processes typically don't require any incorporation/quarterly filings/etc. In my experience, the process requires significantly less paperwork than opening most financial accounts for a business.

Hi To the extent that this applies to our apps, we want to provide good reporting options which help users meet any tax, regulatory, or accounting requirements they have. The app already has transaction history export options (particularly for desktop versions, where they're regularly used for auditing purposes). We'll definitely be expanding this as new reporting features are requested.
As far as capital gains and losses, the BitPay app currently only enters this area with BitPay Card top-ups. We already have some reporting options to help tally those taxable events, and we plan to continue improving that functionality.
(obligatory: I'm not an attorney, BitPay doesn't provide legal or tax advice, etc.)
@_date: 2016-12-22 19:33:20
Hi I'm not sure if I could speak to the differences adequately. I'll try to provide a bit more info though!
Our apps are a bit different from most in that they allow you to create and manage multiple wallets in the same app, including multisignature wallets – which help to mitigate a lot of risk you would otherwise have in trusting all your funds to a single device. If your device was compromised (with malware or by a hacker) your funds can only be protected if another device is used as a second factor (or third, fourth, etc.) Multisig wallets are a fantastic option for securely storing significant amounts of bitcoin.
Also the app is available for Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, iOS, and Windows Phone – so it's easy to access your bitcoin across multiple platforms.
Our apps do have integrations with several outside bitcoin exchanges and services, though I wouldn't say those make the app less secure in any way (those integrations are reviewed as thoroughly as other code in the app). If you'd like, it's also possible to completely disable all integrations in either app – so that's always an option too.
It would be hard to objectively compare our apps against others beyond that – I definitely encourage you to [download the app]( and give it a try! Personally, I think the biggest selling point of the BitPay app is actually it's design – we've put a lot of effort into really polishing the experience and making it simple. In my opinion, the app is one of the simplest true wallets out there, while still being the most secure and fully-featured in the ways I mentioned above.
Hope that helps!

Hey – Thanks for explaining your experience – I'm sorry this is so frustrating. Please take a look at the [fee information]( for the card. (It's should be linked on the website anywhere the cardholder agreement is linked, and it's also included when you get your card.)
I agree that dormancy fees are aggravating. The issue is pretty complex, but I can summarize from my understanding (caveat: I'm a designer, not a lawyer/bank rep/etc).
Due to a tangle of rules, policies, regulations, and accounting requirements in and around the US banking system, a "dormancy fee" is something we're forced to include right now. It's our goal to never actually charge this fee (and as far as I know, we haven't had to do it yet). **We make our money honestly, by providing real services that our customers genuinely value.**
You should get plenty of warning notifications from us "before the fee is charged". It's also extremely easy to reset the clock – just buy anything or use an ATM. If you want to stop using your card for longer than 90 days, just empty it first. 
(And for reference – if it ever seems like BitPay has "tricked" you into giving us money, please let us know so we can make it right.)
We've made a lot of user-experience progress with the new [BitPay wallet]( but we clearly have a lot of work to do. **If you have ideas for how we can make this experience less annoying, I'd really love to work with you. My email address is feedback (That goes to me, and cc's our whole design team.)
For reference – from the link:








*Insert standard warning that I don't represent the FDIC-insured bank holding the balances, "this is not investment advice", nothing above is a contract, please see the terms of service / cardholder agreement for the real deal, etc. 
@_date: 2016-11-01 21:11:20
Hey – the ATM world is not exactly standardized, so to be safe, I'll say "activity" is only going to be events that affect your card balance. (Please keep in mind that ATMs also charge fees.)
To always avoid fees, (if you're not using your card regularly) you may want to simply use your card to purchase something small a few times a year. A small top up would also do the trick.

Hi great question!
The complete answer is our [Design Needed]( list in GitHub issues. We'd love to look at any new issues you open!
From a high level, our design team has put a lot of effort into simplifying the experiences that often make *true wallets* feel more complicated than web-based account services (Bitcoinica, MTGOX, etc). I think that's one of Bitcoin's biggest ecosystem-wide issues, and it will continue to be our top priority. Our goal is to make truly-secure bitcoin storage simple enough for the average user, without compromising and going back to "holding it for them".
On addresses: generally, I think standard bitcoin addresses get a lot of undue hate – in our testing, even very new users understand the address concept quickly and easily. I definitely agree with you in that we have a serious issue with address *authentication* though – without other standards (like [BIP 70 – Payment Protocol]( it's easy for users to be tricked into sending money to the wrong place. (And many bitcoin wallets and account clients still don't even support BIP 70.)
 That's definitely something we're interested in and working on. 
Several very promising related BIPs have already been proposed (47, 63, 75), and there's some great discussion happening on github. I'm hopeful we'll have a good solution in 2017.

For anyone else who finds this: it's worth repeating that pin codes on bitcoin wallets are a "guard rail", not a security measure.

I have no plans to hire someone to do that. It's very well tested, and it's simply a WASM compiled binary from Bitcoin's libsecp256k1, which is fairly well audited.
It's open source though, so if it's important to some users, hopefully we'll get a professional security audit eventually.
@_date: 2018-06-04 20:20:51
Thanks! In the article I link to some examples of wallets projects which could use this library immediately \(Bitcoin wallets written in Javascript/HTML/CSS\). 
As to platforms, you are correct – this is a component you would need to build a platform implementation, not necessarily to use one. Though at least in the case of Bitcoin transactions, the end\-user also needs Secp256k1 to sign transactions, so this library is applicable in both cases.
@_date: 2018-06-04 23:33:12
Ah, sorry, I meant to refer to auditing the resulting output, rather than the source code. I mean it only in the sense that JS ships as a portable language, whereas native binaries are somewhat harder to audit (with the exception of deterministic builds, which are not yet an option on iOS or Android).
�� I can appreciate this perspective. Hopefully that's slowly improving – if not by the average developer improving their skills (I'm optimistic), at least the JS engines are always getting better at optimizing. (At which they are already insanely good.)
And yes! I supposed I should make it more clear that the `ts` stands for TypeScript.

I understand the meme reaction, but it's worth noting that the differences between "native" and "hybrid" apps are pretty meaningless these days. Mobile devices are now good enough, and the web stack now optimized enough, that bugs and performance problems are typically the fault of bad programming, not the platform. \(And it's just as easy to make horribly slow native apps.\) If anything, we can appreciate that Javascript apps are both easy to audit and "sandboxed" by default.

Not sure if there's a best way – since it's a prepaid card, most stores and restaurants will be able to just swipe it and reduce your bill by the $8.35, leaving nothing on the card. (To the cashier, it usually seems the same as a Visa gift card or another prepaid card.)
Personally (sharing at the risk of getting featured on I take a percentage of my salary in USD to my BitPay card account, and buy bitcoin occasionally with it as a funding source. (I try not to hold much USD.)

By providing an officially-supported, BitPay distribution of the Copay project, we're able to more tightly integrate BitPay-powered services into the experience, while still allowing the Copay project to remain true to it's open source nature.
We'll continue to release Copay for all platforms, and the Copay project will continue to be the primary "development head" for BitPay. We're excited to continue developing Copay to be the world's most powerful and open bitcoin wallet platform, and BitPay as the best way to secure and manage your bitcoin.
Right now, the primary difference is the BitPay app's tight integration with the BitPay Card – you can securely pair, manage, and top-up cards with the BitPay app. For people living on bitcoin, this makes it a great interface for managing both traditional finances and bitcoin spending/savings wallets.

Just posted a related answer [here](
On BIP 47 specifically, (IIRC) there are still some questions about how the standard would apply to the Copay/BitPay apps multisig wallets. Generally, we think multisignature is extremely important for risk-mitigation (particularly with company-held funds, for example), so we're hoping for a solution that would work for both singlesig and multisig wallets.

Keep in mind, bitcoin transactions can be very different sizes (in terms of storage space). 
It's very cheap to send a transaction using funds received in only one other transaction, because the resulting transaction is very small. It will cost much more to send funds received in many small transactions, since the output of each previous transaction must be listed in the new transaction. 
It sounds like maybe you're receiving lots of small payments to your wallet? If that's the case, it's possible that the transaction you made was very large – even 10 or more times the size of a normal transaction.

I'm afraid you're looking at the wrong number on the TradeBlock website.
The low number (currently 39 sat/b) is the average for the mempool, which contains around 15,000 transactions right now. If you use that number, your transaction will be in line behind most of the network.
Since other people will probably continue submitting new transactions to the network, it's possible many of those transactions will never confirm.
Hover over a block to see the average fee per byte of that block. (Looking at the past 3 blocks, I see 213, 218, and 170, respectively.)
Looking at the BitPay wallet, "Priority" and "Normal" are both at 217 currently. If you're willing to wait longer, use "Economy" or "Super Economy" (currently 112 sat/b). Just be aware – if you choose lower than "Normal", it's very possible you won't get into the next few blocks, and if you're unlucky, it may take days to confirm. (Or you may even have to try your transaction again later with a higher fee.)
The fees are not a function of your wallet. There's a lot of demand for Bitcoin block space right now, and higher prices are how free markets allocate scarce resources.
For most users, the "Normal" fee policy is the right choice. Here's a good place to visualize the state of the mempool:

You're correct – in general, it's not a good idea to use SHA-1 for new applications. I would like to leave it out, but because it's [used in Bitcoin Script for OP\_SHA1]( it's potentially already in use securing funds. So any Bitcoin Script implementation must also implement SHA-1.

Thanks for the reply – the case of the BIP50 fork is the one I was trying to address with the [CD Fork section]( in that post.
To clarify, nodes following the block they "see first" is simply how miners choose which block to mine next – the safest option is to mine the one most likely to be mined by the rest of the network. So that's not unique to the BIP50 fork – block orphaning happens all the time in the network.
The only safe option is to wait for enough confirmations to be sure that your transaction won't be removed from the blockchain in a chain tip reorganization (either accidental or malicious).
So under Defensive Consensus, this problem is actually reduced. It's highly unlikely that every single implementation in the consensus-critical set will have the same quirky, chain-forking bug at the same time. (And if they do, we're back to the same problem we already had with Bitcoin Core.)

I think it's worth noting that a full node in this system is actually slightly "more secure" than a full node today. It can not be defrauded by an attacker exploiting a bug in Bitcoin Core's consensus code like the [overflow bug]( 
In this case, even a Bitcoin Core full node can be defrauded if it follows the Bitcoin Core chain, which is later reverted to undo any damage. (Obviously, this kind of bug is extremely unlikely these days, but the additional security guarantee is notable.)
So in a sense, I think this issue is more about the definition of a "full" node. I would argue that a single-implementation node in the Defensive Consensus system is at least as secure as today's "full node" running only Bitcoin Core.
Maybe it would be more accurate to choose another name for Defensive Consensus full nodes running the entire set. In a sense they are Highly Available (HA), and might be more accurately described as HA full nodes. (Really only necessary for large operations.)
Most current full node operators could continue running only Bitcoin Core, which (I believe) would provide the same security guarantees as today's full nodes.

Hi all – I'm very interested in defining a path for non-C++ implementations of bitcoin (like [bcoin]( [btcd]( and [parity-bitcoin]( to contribute to the reliability of the bitcoin network. 
I think this scheme provides additional reliability and eliminates the risk of alternative implementations causing an unintentional fork.
I'd love to hear what you think about the idea!
@_date: 2017-05-01 12:31:14
[Bcoin]( already includes SegWit support in master, btcd has [a branch](
I don't know much about parity-bitcoin, though it is very new, so it's reasonable that development might take them more time.
Bcoin is of particular interest, since any bugs in that implementation are likely to be quite different than undiscovered bugs in the C++ implementation. ([Overflows]( anyone?)
@_date: 2017-05-01 18:56:52
This is a conversation that has been had repeatedly for nearly 7 years now. 
I recognize the differences between Bitcoin's requirements and other systems, and I appreciate this viewpoint. It was also my view on the subject until somewhat recently. (You'll find I've cited a lot of writing from great engineers in the space.)
I'd love to hear your feedback after you've read the proposal. I'm sure it has faults, but those faults are likely to be discovered by new arguments and ideas, not from the work I've already cited in the article.
@_date: 2017-05-03 13:18:46


Thanks for responding. Please see [my answer]( to Luke's comment above.
By nature, nothing about this proposal reduces the security guarantees provided by running a single Bitcoin Core full node. As I described in that comment, running a highly-available full node is a method of gaining even stronger security guarantees than are currently provided by a single Bitcoin Core full node.
This is **not** necessary for most individuals currently running full nodes, but it would be very valuable for large entities in the ecosystem (miners, exchanges, payment processors, etc).
Running a highly-available full node would prevent bugs in Bitcoin Core from causing downtime or exposing the node operator to fraud.
As a side effect, this would be very positive for simple full nodes and the network as a whole. Even if another critical bug (like the [overflow bug]( or [BIP50 issue]( was discovered in Bitcoin Core, if a mining majority was running Defensive Consensus, the impact on full nodes or end users would be reduced or eliminated. 
The development community would have plenty of time to diagnose the issue and develop a well-accepted solution.
@_date: 2017-05-03 17:08:02
I think maybe you're referring to DSC1?
If so, you're definitely right. DCS1 is just a risk mitigation strategy for a single miner, and if the chain forked, the miner would be forced to continue mining on the safest chain.
After DCS3, however, I'd argue that Defensive Consensus improves the situation significantly.
Let's assume our consensus-critical set first includes Bitcoin Core 0.7, and after a BIP 9 activation, Bitcoin Core 0.8 is added to the set.
In this case, the fork may still have occurred, but would have been much less damaging.
Since the error was actually an issue of non-determinism in the 0.7 implementation, while some 0.7 implementations would have considered the block valid, a large portion would not. Nodes which found the block to be invalid would continue on the good chain, and a much smaller percentage would mine on the bad chain.
In the case of the BIP50 fork, 60% of the hash power was mining the bad fork. In Defensive Consensus, that number would likely be significantly smaller. If it was less than 50%, the fork would have been a much smaller issue (only causing problems for the minority on the bad fork, not a network-wide emergency).
In this case, while Defensive Consensus didn't completely save us from a bug in Bitcoin Core, it did seriously reduced the scope of damage.
With more implementations in the consensus-critical set, the damage might continue to be reduced.

It seems like bitcoin is even being given preferential editorial treatment.. Side-by-side, the pro-bitcoin article seems to be more substantive and down-to-earth, and being placed first, it gets to shoot down many of the objections on the left before the reader even sees them.

Yes – SPV mining is more about avoiding the latency of receiving and validating blocks coming from other miners. DCS1 only effects how miners construct their candidate blocks, so the issue is there regardless of whether a miner is employing the DCS1 strategy.
DCS1 is just a risk mitigation strategy for individual miners. (And for the amount of time they're SPV mining, they're already taking somewhat greater risks.) There's nothing forcing miners to be doing DCS1 100% of the time, but it's wise for them to employ it for the maximum amount of mining time.

Thank you. I made some changes to that section that will hopefully avoid turning people away like it did for you.


To an extent, this is the premise I'm trying to challenge. Bitcoin is a little different from other open source projects in that simply forking the software doesn't allow one to offer a new feature to the world.
Since the blockchain is a winner-takes-all system, this kind of project lends itself to an unusually strong network effect. I'm basically theorizing on why the Bitcoin space seems to have an unusual amount of politics interfering with the development process.
@_date: 2017-05-01 14:40:25


Yes, this is the argument I make in the post. It's [Peter Todd's argument](
In your example, services would likely fail-safe by shutting down.
Miners, however, could safely continue to follow the 0.7 fork, since blocks produced by that fork could be validated by both implementations. (That's also the example in the post.)


While this is better than allowing payment fraud to occur, a Defensive Consensus system would choose the "safe" fork automatically (the fork which is accepted by all implementations), avoiding the downtime.
For miners, this is an effective strategy starting today (DCS1). Most service operators are likely unable to rely on the strategy until other implementations make it to DCS3.

You're completely right – if another implementation makes it through the signaling process, any blocks which that implementation considers invalid should be considered invalid by the miners. In that case, miners just orphan the invalid block and continue mining as normal.
Adding the alternative implementation to the consensus-critical set significantly limits the possible set of valid blocks, but that's a good thing. If it can't be validated by the alternative implementation, it's probably a bug. The safe option is to disallow it (and let the developers take their time to work out why the two implementations disagreed).

Thanks for the reply. I think you have several strong arguments which I'd like to understand better.


I'm actually not particularly concerned with the "centralization" aspect. I don't see any problem with an implementation created and run by a "lone genius", and if it makes it into the consensus-critical set, that implies it probably has a lot of merit.


I'm not sure if I understand the mechanism here. Lets assume an extreme example: one implementation will not validate any block higher than a certain number. This is a bad bug, and would stop blocks from being mined (until the network either fixed the bug or pulled the implementation from the consensus-critical set). Even in this worst case though, bitcoin can't be stolen. We just get some downtime.


I think we're actually in agreement here – I consider an "implementation" to be a specific version of an bitcoin implementation. Two different versions of Bitcoin Core are rightly considered two entirely separate "implementations".


I'd like to understand this better. It seems like that kind of issue would be cause for re-examining this strategy – could you provide a hypothetical example of some kind?
