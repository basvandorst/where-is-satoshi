Uhh im sorry what? You do realise selling drugs over the internet does not remove "the violence factor" do you really think there is no violence from drug **usage**- something he increased. Its not like he was just permitting some low grade marijuana to be trafficked which I wouldnt give a fuck about. Its the fact the website hosted extremely dangerous narcotics like heroin and devils breath, allowing teens, and addicts (who may are may not have young children) to easily access this. I wonder how many lives were ruined from this?
Lol at you bringing up the DPR, his entire defence was grasping at straws by dredging up alternative theories and creating smokescreens. Lawyers only do that when their clients are guilty as hell and havent a shred of empirical evidence to present. He was never convicted of procuring murder because A)The prosecution wanted to make an example out of him to others, not everyone in Ross' positions went out hiring hitmen. B) It was a scare tactic to have Ross plead guilty and accept plea bargain C) they already had enough dirt on him to convict him for life, there was no need to prolong the trial by going off on a tangent as this often confuses jurys.
"Ross is a genius, not a criminal" sums you up really. Intelligence is by no means mutually exclusive from being a criminal. God the "Free Ross" cult is worse than the biggest shitcoin shills.

We better get you into office. Please outline your tax plan for 2020 and how you plan to allocate spending.

Blatant theft? Do people really empathize with a man who ran a major drug trafficking network and on top of that money laundering and conspiracy to commit murder by hiring a hitman? I'll probably receive downvotes but idgaf. Ross deserves to be in jail, his sentence could be reduced, but he's right where he needs to be.

It's hardly competition and branding though is it? Ver is just piggy backing off the bitcoin name. 1 look at his twitter feed shows nothing but retweets of shill accounts that do nothing but falsely bash bitcoin.
Thats like KFC saying "hey, you shouldn't eat at Mcdonalds. Or you'll get AIDS and die. Come and eat here. We aren't gonna tell you anything about our food though, just come and trust us."

Someone logical here. Ross' defence were pathetic lol all they did was present conspiracy theories to the jury with no concrete evidence.

So is this the last of those *Bitconeeeeect* youtube ads? 
....probably not as this only has jurisdiction in the state of Texas but those scammers know their days are numbered.

Im actually shocked you're getting downvoted by people defending hardcore drug trafficking who compare Elon Musk to Heroin dealers. They're just insecure who think its edgy to be anti-government, when in reality I bet they hadn't the balls to buy anything off silk road.

Lmaoo okay so a man wants to use his finger to pull the trigger of a gun to murder someone, a man wants to use his fists to beat his wife black and blue, a man wants to use his hands to wire an explosive bomb and set it off in a public place. 
Ooo but its his body, I better do nothing- dont wanna be part of the problem. See how flawed your logic is?

This is nothing man, try being a 17 year old kid telling your parents you've invested a 25% of your lifetime savings into a market they see as.....
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:23:21
There arent any. The hypocrisy of this guy is just surreal. He calls those who dont believe in his political agenda "ignorant" yet he tries to undermine us by comparing us to flat-earthers. The irony is there is as little emphirical evidence to suggest the earth is flat as there is to suggest UBI would be a successful long term proposition.
Whats even more shocking is the amount of upvotes he's getting.

Lol I am completely aware of the medical cause of inflammation, it just has no relevance in this instance. Inflammation causes something to swell and rise, the economic term for this is inflation, an appreciation. So you see this would contradict bitcoins recent behaviour due to a deppreciation of its price level. Your analogy is flawed
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:19:37
I'm sorry but that logic is just fucking dumb. A 10 year old could point out this is a much more severe dip. This time could be different for any number of reasons. Want a few? Sure. The recent insider trading at Coinbase, Wall St. Starting to flex their capital by shorting bitcoin, Charlie Lee dumping all of his Litecoin holdings, an exponential amount of newbies freaking out. I mean BTC has fallen 16% in 1 hour the time I'm writing this. **1 fucking hour**
I'm not gonna pretend to be optimistic about this. I'm prepared for the worst and will accept whatever comes. I appreciate this reddit community's resilience, but some of you can be delusional about this. If the dotcom crash- crippling the most innovative companies of all time like Amazon can happen- then be sure that this whole crypto market can come tumbling down to nothing overnight.

Lmao there is incredible bias showing in these articles, just gonna leave this here 
That should give you a true perspective- that isn't extreme left wing- on how ridiculous universal basic income is.

Bad bot. South korea are considering introducing regulation to encourage sustainable growth of btc and eth. Shutting down exchanges is fake news.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:40:10
I never said anyone who isn't on the bitcoin bandwagon is a sheep. How would that make sense? Dont you think for the market to react to fake news those people would need to have a stake in bitcoin? Think before you type next time.

It sure can, House of Cards said it best. 
"You are entitled to nothing. America was built on the spirit of industry. You build your future, it isn't handed to you"
So while it is important the government gives handouts to those who truly need it, a healthy free market can offer the necessary tools to build yourself a better future if you really want it.

You seem to completely misunderstand the dual definition of inflammatory. It can also mean to express particularly cynical remarks in order to provoke a reaction.

Lmao I doubt anyone with a doctorate degree in economics thinks deflation is good. A high school economics student could tell you it isnt good.
