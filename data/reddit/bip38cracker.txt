If you only check for the prefix that OP has posted you will find multiple false positives. And hould you also have checked multiple billions of pw than congratulations because I'm sure not many have the kind of computional power available.

Yes I'm sure. You can verify it yourself, as I signed the message with the corresponding private key.

Yes with prefix I mean the only part that OP posted publicly (1124jx).


If you mean I try to decrypt his encrypted key with passwords that match his description and only check if the prefix is right then yes. I did not look at the checksum, but got a few false positives and added this check in the mean time.

When can we expect this proof? It's been two days...

If you read my posting you will see that I posted the address that i have. I never claimed that I have a different address. So put some bitcoins on the address I posted and I will happily move them.

Did anybody get a "proof"?
I checked all BTC addresses using SQL and there is not a single one with more than 250 BTC (and less than 260) that did not receive any bitcoins in 2019. I think is reasonable to assume nobody would continue sending BTC to an "lost" address.
If we assume that small (send) amounts are ok than there a plenty of addresses that could be used as "proof".
For example, OP could use 1EuYdcHVSDbyJ6z1eaMva9BNSbR7w8JoG6
While at this point I don't think that a actual proof will follow I'm happy to be proven wrong...

OP isn't the most responsive guy...
@_date: 2019-10-07 12:08:19
if you would read my postings you would know that I'm aware that that is not the right address (nor that I claimed it).
Also it is no scam.
Once you have tested over a billion passwords you will very like also find such false positives. Once OP has found his PW it will post the pw that leads to this address using his encrypted key.

You can use your wallet or [ to verify the signature

I understand that you do not want to post your address in public, but you did not provide me with any address that holds funds, so I do not get the "when provided still doubt about it" part. 
And I don't see any reason why you should make up this story or keep it for 3 years. Thats the reason why I started without any sort of proof. But now, as I haven't received any proof and it seems nobody else did, it seems a little bit suspicious. But I ask you again, please send me "proof".
And to all the others: Did anybody receive a proof?
@_date: 2019-10-11 10:43:37
I can now confirm that OP has sent me an address holding enough funds and that no BTC were moved in the last years.
Thank you!

Needless to say I stopped all tasks and would recommend all others to do as well until there is a "proof".

I know :( ..at least he posted somewhere a different one. But let's see, what he says.
