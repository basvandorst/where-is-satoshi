I watched this trailer and imagined a whole new generation of young drug dealers and addicts inspired by this film.

Gotta love bit tippers. Bit dollar parity isn't far, we will look back on these threads and laugh! :-)

I have a feeling these coins might be acquired by large nation states once bitcoin reaches a certain level of massive global adoption.

Title says OP giving away 10 000 dollars in bitcoin. OP really means 10 x 000 dollars.

Could it be possible that some of the vC funding into bitcoin companies is just a sneaky way for investors with capital to buy bitcoin?

Thank you for your enlightening response.  I looked into the BIP's after your response and was happy learning about the existence of these "Bitcoin Improvement Protocols". 
I asked the previous question thinking of a future scenario in which I only carry the BIP39 mnemonics and do not have the Mycelium wallet in which it was generated, and for some reason am not able to reobtain the mycelium software.  
Can I be reasonably certain that in the future I can easily find future iterations of wallets where I can securely import the Mycelium generated BIP39 mnemonics and restore the addresses and keys?
So I can experiment, do you happen to know a recommended wallet that currently exists that is compatible with and can import Mycelium generated BIP39 mnemonics?

I am also curious about the Mycelium HD wallets... if I create a master seed 12 word string from the android app, I understand that I can recreate the HD wallet on another instance of Mycelium. I am curious if I can input this 12 word string on another platform that is not mycelium to recreate the HD wallet on some other wallet software, in case for some reason Mycelium software can no longer be found in the future.

Great idea to build games around Bitcoin. But for some reason to me this screams red flags of the possibility of a Trojan virus that steals bitcoin information. I will wait for it to be in browser to play it!! :-)

That's 5555.5555 BTC at the current market value of $270.
