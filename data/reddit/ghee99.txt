i didnt come on here to "have a debate" with my fellow bit coiners
i came on here to talk about how terrible the technical support from LEDGER is
if you have solutions, i'm all ears
if not, no need to say anything
but i am definitely NOT here to have debates with other redditors who are also members of r/bitcoin like me
@_date: 2018-01-14 19:11:14
or better yet, if an exchange wants your money, but will not give you any way to actually talk to a human there (in case of problems)
then dont do business with them
not 180k of business, or even one penny of business with them.

youre the one who cared enough to deny it
thanks for the laugh (at your expense)
@_date: 2018-01-20 19:38:47


i never got mad at, or insulted anyone in the bitcoin community (I only insulted certain enraged individuals in reply to them *insulting me first*)
as for why anyone would see my complaint against GDAX and LEDGER for their poor tech support, and then attack me for that, i have no idea.
but, as you can see, there were a bunch of people (that i never insulted) who saw my compliant about the lack to tech support, and then they just started viciously attacking me PERSONALLY
Why they did that? i have no idea (mental illness on their part, perhaps?)
Whatever the case, 1/3 of the people upvoted me, and many kind/smart people like you offered actual helpful advice and support
so to all the rude attacked, those haters can suck it
and to those, like you, who were polite and helpful, a big thanks to you.
@_date: 2018-01-20 04:47:58
great, thank you
now if i could just get etherium and bitcoin cash to work on my ledger (neither one does) then i'd be fine
of course, if ledger wasn't a bunch of greedy retards, they would just have a phone number to call and ask
sadly, i have installed bitcoin cash and etherium onto the ledger chrome wallet, (using the manager) and neither one works,
although the bitcoin and litecoin ones do work
fucking ledger, and their shitty, unsupported, VERY expensive, hard-to-use product
i am not sure why some people like these things?
worse (and most complicated) piece of shit electronics i ever had to deal with
i mean, its essentially an encrypted USB stick, and yet i've spend 5 hours and cant even get it to work
even worse, if they just offered even the most basic phone support (or live chat even) then i could have resolved these issues in minutes
as it is, 5 hours wasted, and god knows how many more will be wasted as i try to get their shit-stick to work as they say it should
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:32:22
ok, thanks,
i am going to go back to gdax and try to figure out how to use that site
its the same company as coinbase
but on coinbase (as bad as it is) the process is simple
unfortunately, gdax just confuses me, and i dont understand it or how to use it, at all
but i'll give it another shot, thanks!

ok, great!
I got the ledger nano s to work, and i downloaded the ledger bitcoin wallet via the chrome browser apps
i was able to do a test transfer of .1 bitcoin, and it worked
so far, so good.
now... if you dont mind me asking, how do i transfer the etherium and litecoin that i have won GDAX into my ledger?
on the ledger bitcoin app in chrome, it only takes bitcoin
do i have to download seperate apps on the chrome store for etherium and litecoin as well?
i couldn't find any?
anyway... if you know how to import the litecoin and etherium that i have on GDAX into my ledger, and could tell me, that would be much appreciated
@_date: 2018-01-22 05:10:05

hmmm, let me think, i can buy a beautiful mansion, AND wonderful luxury car like a mercedes or a porsche, and still have 4 million dollars left over
i can buy one insanely overpriced car (that will one 2 million in value the second i drive it off the lot)?
whoever did this is smart at bitcoin investing, and a total retard when it comes to wise use of their winnings.
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:05:22
yeah, so out of touch to want tech support

he has destroyed entire economies, and ruined the lives of hundreds of thousands of people

@_date: 2018-01-09 01:34:52
oh, but i never instant buy
i just have it linked to my bank account (NOT to my credit card)
so, it takes about a week after i buy before its actually in my account
and yet, they STILL charge me 1.5% AND ALSO, i pay about $100 more per bitcoin, than they actual price at the moment
i mean wow! what a scam coinbase is doing
ripping off their customers in the sneakiest ways possible
and charging six times what they charge on their other website (gdax) for the exact same product.
makes me think they are total crooks!
@_date: 2018-01-20 08:23:16
oh excusuuuuuse me for not instinctively knowing how to use the very complex system of online wallets and hardware storage that goes with them
excuuuuuuuse me for wanting there to be some technical support, or clear step by step directions
you might know how to use a ledger already, but the rest of us do sometimes need to ask for help from technical support people at times
and expecting a company that sells hardware that can hold hundreds of thousands of dollars of crypto value to offer a basic technical support department is hardly out of line (no matter what an out-of-touch attacker like you says)

i suck at it?
put 18.5 K into crypto, starting in nov. 2017
its now doubled in value (although it was 3x at the peak)
still, i'm cool with that
made over 20K since november, i can deal with that.
and as i'm just HODLing it all, i'm sure even more money will be made by me

yeah, the NYT is popular here in America (and other places too)
which is kinda sad, because its mostly fakenews (although it does have some good informational articles at times too).
I just dont want to support the NYT because when it comes to anything to do with US politics, they lie nearly 100%
so sure...i'll read free NYT articles, but give that dishonest paper even one penny of my money?  nope, I wont do that.
other than that, nice to be talking to someone in Austria, very exciting!

@_date: 2018-01-21 19:53:56
i invest in bitcoin, but i also put money in the stock market
i have 200K in a vanguard fund (80% stocks and 20% bonds)
i choose one of their very conservative, low risk investment funds, and my returns were over 10% (meaning i made a little over 20k this year on just that one fund)
in other words, in the stock market i make over $350/week 
I am also making money in an IRA i have with vanguard too.
Thats like a part time job.  But one that i dont have to do ANY work for.  I'm getting "paid" every week for simply letting my money sit in my vanguard account.  
You see, thats called passive income (the same as i make off my 2 real estate investments)  thats how you build wealth (tax law and many other things make becoming wealthy off of a salary alone very difficult).  Am I rich right now? Nope, but I'm taking all the steps to build wealth.
Am I depending upon bitcoin/crypto to become wealthy?  Nope, its just a little side investment (that I hope will grow exponentially, but if it doesnt it wont really matter in the long run)
Guys like you?  pulling all your money out, and trying to "time the market" (the ultimate fool's errand) think youre soooo smart right now.  But based on everything you said, it certainly seems like you are just a random gambler, with no real plan, or even a basic awareness of how to create ongoing and sustained returns or build wealth.
but hey... geniuses like you just pulled ALL of your money out of the stock market?  LOL and you think thats *smart*?  haha, OK, good luck to you on all that.
yeah, your a real smart guy

Paul Krugman did write a left wing paper on micro-lending that won him a nobel (that doesnt mean he understands economics on a national scale)
besides, it was krugman who predicted that the us economy would crash if Trump won the election
and krugman has spoken positively about bernie sanders economic policies
bernie sanders?!!!??? 
basically, krugman does understand basic economic terms, but he is an advocate of the failed economic policies pushed by the left (and we all know how successful leftist-run economies are)

well, if being the "dumbest" investor means that i get to keep adding more than nearly 10K/month in value, off of an initial capital outlay of 18.5K then I can live with that
and with compounding returns, and/or higher growth, that 10K/month could wind up being even more
anyway, thats how this "dumb" investor is doing
Probably better than a *genius* like you!
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:55:40
oh thank you for your unhelpful condescention
in reality, i have spend countless hours watching youtube and googling
and the info there is often wrong and contradictory (not to mention out of date, or info given by those with dishonest agendas)
for example, when i have a problem with my account or need to transfer money with my real bank, i can just call my bank if i need help
on the other hand, coinbase and gdax have made much more money from me than any bank ever has, and no support support available from them at all.
and no one says, "oh... you want to transfer funds from your Bank of America account, no problem ,just try to find a youtube video on how to do that from some stranger"
similarly for the ledger nano S
there are VERY expensive, and yet, unlike just about every other piece of electronics out there, they offer no help line, or tech support phone number.
anyway... you clearly dont really want to be helpful, so take your smugness elsewhere, i am not interested
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:58:35
is that a ccyptoasset?
or do you just mean "dinero" as a slang term for money?
i have money sitting in my coinbase account, should i just transfer that over to gdax?  and buy from gdax?   
the whole gdax and coinbase thing is so confusing (i thought they were the same company, right?)
@_date: 2018-01-20 04:42:58


no kidding
although its not helpful at all
look at the thumbs up/thumbs down at the bottom of their support articles
it tends to be about 10 people" found this article helpful"
and then about 150 or more "did not find this article helpful"
THAT MEANS ALMOST EVERYONE USING THEIR HELP SECTION ARTICLES IS NOT BEING HELPED (myself included)
not to mention, some of the help articles that i clicked on on the ledger support section were links that no longer even worked!
thats alway why i specifically said "should offer basic tech support from human beings"
you do know what a human being is, right?
stop being an ass, LEDGER's technical support is horrible, it sucks, stop trying to defend their shitty, shitty service
and stop being a condescending asshole
and no... if there is a need for customer service that doesn't suck (which clearly there is) then these companies need to start offering it, or some company who does offer it will come in and take over (and because ledger was so shitty to us customers, we will have no loyalty towards them)
@_date: 2018-01-14 06:28:26
nothing personal, but there is a lesson to be learned here
DO NOT SEND A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS TO A COMPANY THAT DOES NOT EVEN HAVE A TELEPHONE, OR ALLOW YOU TO TALK TO A HUMAN BEING.

soros was a jew (he is not anymore, btw)
during the war, he pretended to be a christian, and he helped the nazis go after other jews in hungary
all of which might be understandable, except for the fact, that (even now) soros describes his time working with the nazis as "the happiest time in my life"
i mean... do some basic research (there is audio tape of soros saying this)
and please... dont use snopes (that is a super discredited site)
the link you have talks about how soros wasn't an ss officer, etc
i never said he was a nazi officer, i just pointed out that he collaborated with the nazis, and that he loved doing it.
seriously... are you a paid soros shill?  who would ever defend such a man?

i didnt buy 40K of bitcoin and other crypto
i bought about 18K and its now worth about 40K
it was more before this latest dive.
anyway... all these people are saying do your research, learn how to do "basic transactions"
um, that IS what i am doing!!!
i bought a ledger Nano S as a first step (figured there was no way to learn how to use it until i owned on)
Now i have a ledger Nano S, and there is ZERO TECH SUPPORT
and i have spent hour after hour researching, youtube videos are a mess, and say different things
if there was just  HUMAN BEING or TECH SUPPORT that could explain things
but NOOOOOOO!!!!
these exchanges dont tel you that, nor does ledger
they pretend like they work, but they dont work, and you cant even talk to anyone.  Youre 100 percent on your own, and there is no way to get accurate and helpful info
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:40:56
thank you
although i did do that
its set up and configured
but beyond set up, thats where specific instructions stop
and now that i need to actually use it, there is no tech support to ask
and its not even being recognized (while plugged in and unlocked)
and hey... shouldn't be a big deal IF THERE WAS ANYONE TO TALK TO ABOUT IT
bit alas, no tech support, no specific instructions on how to import crypto, and not even any instructions on how to add other coins like litecoin
it just says "connect and unlock your wallet " (even though i have already unlocked the wallet and it IS connected - and yes, i have restarted a couple of times)." in the chrome ledger app now
holy shit, for the fucking overpriced cost, you think they would support their devices.
alas, everyone in the community just insults me for not knowing "basic transactions" (as if i was supposed to be born knowing how to use bitcoin wallets) and the companies are even worse (as they have complex systems, with no support, that youre supposed to just figure out on your own)
@_date: 2018-01-29 09:41:49

then its like talking about how fidel castro was a good baseball player, but not even mentioning that he literally murdered thousands of people, and that he enslaved an entire nation for decades

yeah, buts its kinda like talking about how hitler was a devout vegetarian
he might have been, but to just talk about that and not mention that he was pure evil in other parts of his life is kinda a large omission.
same with soros, does he understand economics? perhaps, but sharing his opinion on things and not mentioning that he's an evil mother fucker who describes working with the nazis as "the happiest time in my life" kinda leaves out a few important details, no?
@_date: 2018-01-20 19:26:10
why do banks and credit cards, and just about every possible electronics company have technical support help lines?
because sometimes people need help configuring their assets or their electronics
stop acting like anyone who needs technical support is somehow bad

yes, i do understand the difference between weather and climate (unlike the global warming alarmists who freak out every time there is a snow storm or heat wave)
and no, I (personally) have not debunked anything, but lots of smart websites like climatedepot.com have 
@_date: 2018-01-22 06:11:59
oh, i see
your website made so much money that you just let it die?
good one!
as for "how's that bitcoin doing??"
well, considering that up still up almost 20K (on an intital 18.5K investment) its doing pretty awesome for me.
my BTC returns are about 60% (amazing for about 10 weeks)
my ETH is much more, maybe 150% or thereabouts 
and litecoin is about the same rate of return or perhaps shightly better overall compared to ETH
And i just started investing in November 2017
So, to answer your question, hows my BTC (and crypto) investing going?
its going amazing.  And make a note, I'm betting it will hover around 11-12 for a bit, but by end of february/march, there will be another big increase in value (personally, i'm actually hoping it will dip down to about 9K for a bit, which will be another buying opportunity for me)
But whatever the case, unless something big happens, I'm just going to HODL (until next november at least) on to what i have, to avoid short term capital gains tax rates on the profits I have seen already.
but either way, i feel so happy to have gotten in when i did, and i cant wait to see how much higher this can go.
Of course, youre just sitting on the sidelines now, out of the game, and not even a player anymore.
Oh well.... real BTC investing is for big boys, you just relax and play with your imaginary websites

why the "lol"?
is hard climate science funny to you?
or is there even one thing on there that you can prove to be wrong?
i mean, if you want to follow fake science, thats cool (al gore can keep on making his silly movies for you)
but if you want to learn whats real in regard to climate and "global warming", then i suggest you look at the real science (not just the drivel that al gore and leonardo dicaprio make up)
@_date: 2018-01-20 19:24:15

did you listen to a 500 page audiobook on crypto assets like me?
i thought not
so you 100% wrong
there is a difference between learning about crypto (which i am doing , but there is much more yet to learn) and knowing how to use a poorly supported hardware wallet like ledger, that has ZERO technical support that you can talk to.
@_date: 2018-01-30 03:19:43

i'm waiting
just as i thought, you cant name one single lie i have told
the real question is why are you defending george soros?
@_date: 2018-01-20 19:18:28
its not
no one from ledger even explains that you need multiple wallets
but its cool
the retards at ledger wont give clear info or any tech support, but i figured it out
while you just insult me, i'll just lie back, chill, and count my assets
@_date: 2018-01-20 19:21:57
it a sign of a shitty person to insult someone who hasn't insulted or said anything mean to you first

stay on the issues people, and dont ever personally insult anyone who hasn't insulted you first 
@_date: 2018-01-30 03:18:48

i called him a nazi collaborator (one who calls that time of collaboration "the happiest time of my life")

youre an apologist for george soros?
please look into the history of this evil man
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:47:19
i didnt put 40k into bitcoin
i put 18K in, it turned into 40K
i figured i'd learn as i invested
coinbase had high fees, but at least it was simple and understandable
now that i have taken everyone advice, and put my crypto into GDAX (for the lower fees)
and now that i have also decided to HODL and try to put my crypto in a ledger nano s (as you all have suggested as well) i am realizing that IF i mess up i could lose all my value,
and yet...there is contradictory (or no) info on how to do most of these "basic functions"
sorry iwasnt born knowing how to do these basic functions
and since there is no human or comprehensive tech support, i am perplexed
sorry to have offered those of you who know everything already
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:53:56


no, i don't pay via credit card (doing it that way the fees are even higher)
i pay via my bank account, the fee is 1.5%.
It takes about 7 days before i have actual access to the crypto asset I purchased
so yes... the order is filled instantly via bank payment, but i cant actually have the bitcoin (or other asset) into my coinbase wallet until a week or so later.
thats fine (as i just want to buy and HODL)
i just want to be able to buy without the insane fees and rip-off charges
From what others have so helpfully shared with me on this thread, it looks like ditching coinbase, and using GDAX instead is the way to go.
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:48:09
well, on to step 2
figuring how to add multiple cryptos to my ledger wallet (besides just bitcoin)
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:18:40
wow, i'm not saying i believe its true
but, hey....
ya never know.
but its cool, i'm a HODler and I have enough BTC to live in a citadel, so life will be good for me
@_date: 2018-01-21 05:11:56
i was only insulting in reply to others who personally INSULTED me first

you have 4K
sorry fool, you just got pwned
@_date: 2018-01-20 19:16:05
i bought in increments (anywhere from 500-2000)
much of what i bought was in nov 2017 when crypto was 7-10K
although i've kept buying through out at different times
all in all, my investment of 18.5 k has more than doubled, and i think that, all in all, i will make even more money if i HODL
@_date: 2018-01-21 09:53:29

doing things like that?
are you not ashamed of yourself?
look what your life has turned into
youre a joke to me
i feel no need to reply to every thought a retards spouts

no need to reply, dimwit
@_date: 2018-01-20 04:53:36
youre correct
it wasn't november 2016, i meant 2017
i have had money in BTC, ETH, and LTC since nov 2017 (and i even put $1000 into BCH just for the hell of it, you never know)
since then, it had tripled at one point, but now its just about 2X
still, a pretty good return on an investment of under 3 months
I'm still learning, and if i point out that ledger and their (non-existent) technical support on their VERY over-priced shitty hardware wallet sucks, then theres nothing wrong with that (a lot of people, not just me, are struggling with how the lack of live customer support sucks)
and if you dont have anything positive or helpful to say, then just shut your yapper, youre the one insulting me, and with a shitty attitude
i mean, seriously... i complain about lack of customer support from some company that offer bad support, and then you use that as an excuse to personally insult me?  wtf?
youre weirds, wtf? are you the owner of ledger? and feel hurt that i critiqued your product?
if not, then STFU, and stop initiating personal insults to a fellow bit coiner!
@_date: 2018-01-20 02:00:23
i didnt even know that was a subreddit, i just joined

they take up to a week to get me the order!
and they buy it at one price, and then they sell it for even more, all while charging me $100 more, PLUS 1.5% in fees
of course, as i just learned, i can just buy the same bitcoin on GDAX and not pay the rip-off fees
so, the fact that i can buy it with out the rip-off fees on GDAX lets me know that the HUGE coinbase fees are not needed, just a pure rip-off of their customers (and done in a very sneaky way)
i'm so over scummy, sneaky, coinbase!!!

so sure... if you consider that lowly, that only shows that you dont understand real estate
i mean you re aware that, at this very moment, the president of the USA is a man who made billions buying and selling real estate?
i'm not saying that i'm doing THAT well.  I dont make billions, but i do well.

oh wow
so, i will try them.
its so weird
i mean, gdax and coinbase are the same company, selling the exact same thing
and yet coinbase charges 6 TIMES AS MUCH?
and coinbase adds an extra $100 fee on top of that, too.
but GDAX doesnt
its all so shady
although... thanks for that info, i'll try to figure out how to use gdax, now.
oh yeah.. and thanks for the info!!!
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:59:54
pay more?
why not just charge me the actual price?  why rip me off?

i was able to download a etherium app (from the chrome app store)
i wasn't able to find any litecoin app in the chrome app store
its all so confusing
**do i need a seperate wallet for each separate coin?**
or can i have multiple coins in one ledger chrome wallet?
....and if i need a separate wallet fo reach coin??? why is there no seperate ledger liteocin wallet in the chrome app store ???
simple questions, and ones that tech support could answer in one minute
as it is, i have been trying to set up these basic wallets for days, and still confused, and fucking LEDGER wont support their products
and god forbid i critisize ledger for their shittey, non-existent tech support, if i dare to do that, people personally, insult me!
Its impossible
setting up a simple wallet takes days, and there is no support
and ask questions?  that just gets you insulted
its a VEY fcuked up system (and one that could be solved in one call to tech support if those assholes at ledger would just turn on a telephone and help their customers)

@_date: 2018-01-20 03:31:35
HOLY SHIT
what a condescending attitude!!!
i am not asking you for your free advice
i AM SAYING that an institution that holds 40K and more of my money (and has been charging me huge fees all the while) should at least offer basic tech support on how to transfer it.
and also, a company like ledger that sells a $5 usb stick for crypto (and charges $125 for it) should offer basic tech support from human beings
but hey... you didnt come to offer anything helpful, as such, you can take your insulting unhelpful comments and shove them up into your own asshole

I am in Los Angels California, and I'm a realtor.
I have had a couple of clients buy houses with bitcoin proceeds as downpayment, or partial payment.
it was pretty simple, but i had to use a special lender that I know that was familiar with bit coin, as many of the usual big lenders (like WellsFargo or BOA, etc) have too many internal rules that limit them, and they just dont know how to deal with with bitcoin/cryptocurrencies, and quite frankly, when they dont know they usually just cant be bothered.
Anyway... long story short, it can definitely be done (and pretty easily) just let your realtor and especially your lender know first, as there are a few things we have to do early in the process to make it happed smoothly and without too many (or hopefully any) delays.

yeah, sooooo basic
just connect your ledger, and then nothing happens
except for that i get a message from the chrome ledger app saying"connect and unlock your wallet " (even though i have already unlocked the wallet and it IS connected - and yes, i have restarted a couple of times).
no big deal, i'll just call tech support
wait... there is no fucking tech support
they want me to trust their device with near 50K in value, but they dont even tech support it?
shit, that sucks
dont rag on me because ledger and gdax (and most of the other exchanges too) suck
and dont offer tech support either

@_date: 2018-01-20 08:17:51
once again, you are a perfect example of a bad behavior on the internet
i complained about bad technical support (and i think all reasonable people can agree that many of the companies we deal with in the crypto assets world have terrible customer service/tech support).
i did not make a post personally insulting you or personally insulting any other person on r/bitcoin
and yet, instead of offering anything helpful, or just keeping your mouth shut, your reaction to me being critical of GDAX and LEDGER was to personally insult me
thats retarded
seriously, why would you think that insulting me because i dont like ledger tech support was a good idea?
clearly, there is something wrong with you, and others like you who think that personally insulting others (just because you don like that i complained about a crypto company) is OK.
just offer helpful advice, or dont say anything.
and NEVER insult someone on this subreddit if they haven't insulted or attacked you first.
got it?
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:03:09
if you only knew, thats the opposite of my experience
and yes, i have been researching bitcoin for months now
i even read the cyyptoassets book
plus countless hours
but none of that has explained to me how to properly transport assets from GDAX to my ledger nano s
and since the etherium and bch arent seomething that i can get to work on there (at this point 5 hours in and still trying!!!) then i think the BEST solution would be if Ledger has ANY sort of live, real human being support at all
but they dont
its a shitty product, non-intuitive, not supporters, and very difficult to figure out, and with shitty, out of date support articles (many of which are incorrect, outdated, or just not helpful at all)
but hey... i point that problem out, and its like everyone e on here takes the fact that i point out how shitty ledger is as a reason to personally attack me (even though my post was not an attack on any user on here, it was just an attack on the lack of support by these companies)
and no, if you google a lot of this stuff, there are thousands of articles, and it takes hours, and (thus far) even after hours of looking, no solution
HOLY SHIT this fucking company sucks! if they just hd tech support, even a live chat window, i could have just asked them a couple of my questions and been done in 5 minutes
as it is, i am 5 hours in, and barely any closer
FUCK LEDGER
and if want to personally insult me for saying that, same to you!

thats fast for crappy Kraken
i joined 5 weeks ago specifically to have an exchange where i could by ripple
i'm stuck at tier 2, unable to buy, and they wont approve me for tier 3 (which is what you need to be able to buy)
i missed the boat to buy ripple when it was lower
i wont make the mistake of trying to use kraken again.
shitty exchange, and i'm still waiting for them to verify me
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:50:59
no not a troll
just someone who started buying in november 2016
and started in coinbase
then listened to you all and imported that crypto into gdax (because you all here said that was better, as it had lower fees)
i also took the advice to get a ledger nano s
and now that i have that, i cant figure out how to get bit coin into it?
for example, do i go to gdax and "send"?
or go to the ledger wallet in chrome and "recieve"
or both?
thats just one of the questions, but as i could lose my crypto if i do it the wrongly, i would love to talk to a human being
BUT THERE IS NO HUMAN OR LIFE SUPPORT
just emails of exchanges and nano, that no one replies to
and confusing youtube videos
Sure, i am not the ONLY one confused and overwhelmed?
and yet, to bring up issues that I AM SURE I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE HAVING i get called a troll or told to get out
this is a real problem (lack of support to specific correct information) and if me bring it up makes you think i am a troll, all i can say is that you are out of touch with many of use who want to learn, but are underwhelmed, and unsupported (even though we WANT to learn)

i think i lost more than 10K since around Christmas time.
oh well... i'll hodl
but still, i hear all this talk of Lambos, but in reality, all bitcoin and alt coin investing as done is LOSE me a ton of money.

oh i did!
i'm still waiting for both kraken and gemini approval (and waiting for bitstamp, too)
right now, the ONLY exchanges that have approved me are GDAX and coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:21:03
i've been waiting 3 weeks, and no end in sight
so sure... some waiting seems ok
but that long a wait, and no way to talk to a human does make me wary
i mean, they want me to trust them with ten of thousands of dollars (or more) and yet they can even sign me up, or let me talk to a human being?
that does make me worry a bit (to say the least)
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:28:39
apparently coinbase/GDAX rolled out BitCoinCash (with no advance specific notice)
(almost certainly after they bought a ton themselves in advance)
then they watched the price skyrocket, and stopped all ability for their customers to sell when the price was at peak.
it was all a big pump and dump (for them)
all while they blocked anyone else from even being able to sell any of the overpriced bitcoin cash 
This was the most obvious scam yet by far (and there have been a few over the last few years)
this is a textbook definition of pump-n-dump AND insider trading
just dont ever forget that it was GDAX/coinbase that scammed you, me, and everyone else.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:11:06
wow, you got lucky
i've been waiting a month
that their approval is so erratic is a serious warning sign to me that they are a mess
anyway, i'll keep waiting, who knows? maybe one day they'll get  their shit together enough to actually verify customers?
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:28:41
thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:32:22
i just have to do my research on how exactly to do that sort of transfer (and configure my nano s that just arrived int he mail yesterday)

i have perfect credit, a high credit score, and nothing shady or criminal in my past (ever)
i have long credit history, bank accounts that are well funded, and have been in the same city for over a decade
and its still been a month
oh well...
but just so you know, its not just people with checked pasts
i have a perfect past in all financial regards, and still no verification
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:26:07
so true
and coinbase employees will probably buy up tons of ripple right before coinbase offer ripple to the public, and then they will list it on coinbase with no advance notice
and then when it spikes, the coinbase employees will stop all selling (other then them selling their own ripple) when its at peak prices.
once they have dumped all their own shares at top prices, they will unfreeze ripple trading again on coinbase, and the price will drop down again, or crater.
(I mean, i dont KNOW that is what they will do, but that is what they did with bitcoin cash - and they make a killing, so thats most likely what they'd do again).
oh... but copinbase said they are "looking into claims that coinbase employees rigged the system" 
Oh, i am sure they are looking into it (just the same way that OJ is looking for the "real killer") ...and i'm sooooo sure that coinbase will really do *anything* about it  
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:39:17

i am in the usa, so i need level three on kraken
i have been waiting 5 weeks to get approved, and no approval yet.
i've been waiting almost that long for my gemini verification
i hate coinbase, but hey... at least you can actually sign up and use it.  sadly the other exchanges seem to be seriously cucked with all the bullshit they make you do (and then they still can not get approval/verification done in OVER a month)
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:02:22
yes, if they cant even process the people who want to give them business, thats a major warming sign (to me) that they dont have their shit together, and that they are probably seriously screwed up in other ways also
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:08:22
yeah, good luck getting verified on bitstamp
I signed up and sent them my documents 3 weeks ago (22 days ago, actually) and (as of today) here is the message I'm still getting:
"STATUS: PENDING DUE TO THE INCREASE IN USER REQUESTS YOUR VERIFICATION REQUEST MAY TAKE MORE THAN 24 HOURS TO RESOLVE."
may take more than 24 hours?
yeah, its taken MORE than 24 hours, its taken 528 hours already (and i'm still waiting)
Not saying bitstamp is no good (i haven't used it) but when a site cant even get its shit together to verify people who want to be its customers, then that lets me know that they are a seriously disorganized mess, and that getting any support from them (if there is ever a problem) will be impossible.
That they are this screwed up is a serious danger/warning sign to me to be very careful with them (that is, if they even ever verify me)
what a mess!
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:31:27
good luck
i know, in my case, i've been trying to get authenticated on kraken for 5 weeks now
i've written them multiple times, but their customer service is garbage
can you imagine if a real bank or stock exchange/trading desk did this with its customers?
or if a bank just kept its customers money and didnt respond if a customer lost their PIN number?
we need to abandon these companies that will not respond to their customers
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:18:43
yes, i have some cyptoassets in coinbase, and my nano s just arrived, so i think i'll look into how to get it out of coinbase and onto my own device (i think i just transfer my coinbase assets to GDAX, and then from there, i can put them into my nano with low/no fees?)
anyway, not exactly sure... but i'm trying to figure it out now.
so who knows? but thanks for the input!

it helps the middle class the most
although, in actual dollars, the rich pay more, so they get more dollars back
poor people dont pay any federal income tax (in fact, they tend to get money back when they file, in credits) so technically... poor people dont benefit much from a tax cut (as they dont pay taxes)
although, as poor and middle class people tend to work for businesses, the tax cut for businesses will mean better pay and more jobs (so if you think it through, it helps ALL people)
basically, its 100% good (unless you are super wealthy, with lots of deductions, and multiple homes, and live in a high tax state)
As for cyber assets, they'll generally be taxes at the lower capital gains rate, so anyone who makes money in bitcoin will be in good shape.

yes, i agree
i think cold storage is the way to go
trusting (this already proven to be corrupt company) to keep your crypoassets safe is foolish (at least thats my opinion)
time to head to green (and more trustworthy) pastures
its a shame, because it was nice to have the simple interface that coinbase offered, but they have just shown us that they cant be trusted AT ALL
time to explore other options

i signed up a month ago
STILL waiting to be verified
I mean... seriously, if a company cannot even verify customers WITHIN ONE MONTH!! it does make me think that they just might not have their shit together.
ONE FREAKIN' MONTH (just to get verified - and i'm STILL WAITING)
If it takes OVER a month to be verified to give them my business, how long will it take customer service to get back to me if there's a problem with my account, or a transaction? a year?  more? will the never get back to me?
Their poor service, no way to check on status of my verification, and no human contact person that i can get ahold of makes me VERY wary.
I'm not saying I wont use it, but taking over a month to verify potential customer is a MAJOR RED FLAG for me.
And yes... I cant stand coinbase, and their high fees, but at least it works (most of the time) and you are able to join it.

hey, i'm not the one who brought him up
i was just replying to the other poster who said " it will go done and not recover if you believe different then good luck with that, you probable voted for trump to lol"
but sure... i'm like you, in that i agree, it doesnt matter who you voted for, if you have something informative, interesting, or wise to share about bitcoin and crypto assets, i'm happy to hear from you.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:40:01
ok, good info, thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:46:34
well, good luck to you in getting verified
but hey... who knows? maybe its our guardian angels looking out for us and delaying our verification
if theres a huge drop in the next few days, maybe it will keep us from buying too high, and allow us to buy right after it takes a big dip?
its all beyond our control anyway... all we can do it sign up, and then whenever we're approved, we can go from there

personally insulting or name calling of other users of r/bitcoin is against the rules of this subreddit.
please re-read the rules if you forgot that, 
and once you do, please come back and join us.
you see, we can have different opinions, and we can talk about ideas and thoughts.
all with out insulting or name calling each other.
if we, here on r/bitcoin, are polite to each other, then this community is that much better.
So, once again, please no more personal insults (against the rules, here).
no insults, and lets all just be polite and respectful to each other as people (even if we disagree on thoughts, ideas and opinions).

cool, but i did not personally insult you, or any other user of this sub
on the other hand, you did personally insult me and engage in name calling (which is against the rules of this subreddit)
I follow the rules of this subreddit
i talk about bitcoin, and never call names.
i stay on point, and i can only suggest you do the same.
please limit your comments to bitcoin, and no more calling me names, please.
we can be a better community if others stop with the name calling, and if you (like me) just focus your comments on the subject of bitcoin.
i am bearish on bitcoin (which is my opinion and its a opinion that is allowed on here)
if you don like that, then share with me your ideas why?
but personally insulting me and calling me names like "troll" because i was bearish on bitcoin?
thats against the rules.
please follow the rules, like me.
Hope that helps, fellow bit coiner, and peace and love to you!
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:21:31
yes, 
and lets not forget, bitcoin is a decade old technology
and with so many advances in blockchain tech, what are the odds that someone invents something better than bitcoin?
very likely, i would say.
and with something better, newer, less volitile and with better tech out there, people could flock to the newer/better crypto asset
and IF that happens, bitcoin could crash to zero
so, there are many paths for bitcoin to fail on, and very few paths to success/lambo/moon
@_date: 2018-08-29 16:38:24
ok, sure,
heres the bucket

in other bitcoin news: In Australia, Bitcoin has just hit a YTD new high and the same is bound to happen in America in just a few hours!
@_date: 2018-08-08 01:54:26
not even when it hits zero?
@_date: 2018-08-30 04:32:51
well, i hear all this talk about how any day now, all these advances will make bitcoin worth so much more
thus far, its all just empty talk, and bitcoin (even with all these advances) keeps crashing lower and lower
if with all these wonderful things happening, it still crashes, then there really is no hope for it
i mean, i HOPE youre correct,
but my opinion is that it will just keep on crashing lower
i am getting tired of people on here always saying its going to go to the moon any day now
they say this for month after month, and it never happens
i'm done with all the talk, unless i see action (as in higher prices) i don't care
i am all about real numbers, not lofty dreams
and the real numbers look horrible for this year
and in my opinion, they'll be even worse in the days ahead
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:42:30
have you seen bitcoin today?
its down EVEN more
crashing hard
thats not "better than a bank" to me
i never lost more than half my money in a bank, in just a few months
sadly, with bitcoin, I'm down 65% in 2018
@_date: 2018-08-06 19:27:03
yes, there was a time, in the past, when bitcoin was a good buy.
in the past bitcoin had great growth. 
bitcoin, for early adopters was great (no one denies that).
but even early adopters who didn't sell at 20K have now lost 65% of what they once had
the time that bitcoin was a good investment has passed, and no one (other than tech billionaires or whales) is making money on it any more.
from here on out, its just a suckers bet to buy in (in my humble opinion)
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:35:28
so true
you'll be brokeAF
but at least you will feel comforted by the fact that you have supported the bitcoin technology that made a bunch of whales into billionaires
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:23:13


insult those of us who bought more recently
great plan!
@_date: 2018-08-12 03:44:59


yes, it is based on the **fact** and the **data** that bitcoin is worth less than 1/3 of what it was worth just 8 months ago
its been going down, non-stop for months (all of 2018) and thats a FACT
and its still crashing hard, down down down, lower and lower
Look at the DATA, and you'll see bitcoin is in bad shape
i can't say for sure that it will be even less by the end of 2018
but my OPINION, based on the most recent FACTS and DATA show that it is trending down
I wish the best for bitcoin, but just because it had ups before, they might not happen again
after all, another FACT is that past gains are not guarantees of future successes
@_date: 2018-08-14 22:01:25
and i am going to copy yours for when its 2020 and bitcoin is 2k or less (exactly as i predict it will be)

its the health section (not politics), and its reporting on an actual study done at stanford university

this same study is reported on many websites
just google "bleach bath" and you will see all the research you could ever want on the skin benefits of bleach baths for many people.

nonetheless, its sad to see bitcoin crashing so hard and for so long, and so relentlessly

yup, investing in BTC isn't for me
i hate bitcoin
i mean... i will HODL what i have, but buy MORE bitcoin?
no, i won't do that, i feel that bitcoin will keep crashing for the next 2 years, at least
i'll just focus on what i have done well with (stocks and real estate)
but bitcoin, i feel it will be down to $4K within 2 weeks, and then even lower after that, so I'm gonna stay away

i hope bitcoin goes to the moon

so I *hope* my bitcoin value increases
@_date: 2018-08-14 03:37:27
oh, there are bears
lots and lots of bears
we are drowning in bears
@_date: 2018-08-05 17:37:46
i agree
if you just forget about it and come back in 10 years you might have a lot of money
then again, tying up money for years (that you could otherwise put into money making projects) is not always good financial sense (for example, instead of typing up all your assets for years in bitcoin, use that money as a down payment on a house, live in that house, and watch how much that asset increases in value, and at the end of 10 years you can sell that house and pay zero taxes on the profit you made - at least that the case in the USA for the first $250K in profit you make).
besides, sure... we *think* that btc will be accepted in 10 years, but thats a long time, in a decade who knows what else someone will come up with
will someone come up with something better in 10 years?  the way technology and innovation moves now, its certainly possible.
What we think of as an innovation (a crypto asset) maybe just seem old and outdated in a few years, when the next biggest, better thing comes along.
its like i have always said, investing in bitcoin is a huge gamble, and the odds of coming out ahead are slim to none (other than those who were early adopters).
even the early adopters, if they are wise, should consider cashing out now (if they haven't already).
not to mention, with all the pump and dumps, tech billionaires manipulating, and all the other scams and behind-the-scenes bad actors, most people won't want to deal with a risky and unsafe venture like btc.
basically, the only sure way to make money on btc is to be a billionaire, and then engineer pump and dump schemes, and get rich off the suckers (i.e. regular people) who have stuck their money into bitcoin.
no wonder bitcoin is down 15% just this week, and has been crashing hard for 7 months straight (and is still crashing hard).
@_date: 2018-08-10 05:53:24
by2020 is my guess
@_date: 2018-08-21 02:46:31
i was an idiot
i bought starting in november 2017, and continued for a few months, foolishly believing what i was told on here (that bitcoin would keep rising till it hit $40k or more.  LOL what a joke, bitcoin didn't rise, it just wound up crashing down, down, down, and its STILL crashing 8 months later (with no end in sight)
that was my mistake, and i accept 100% of the blame for my stupidity
i lost 60% of what i put into bitcoin within these last 8 months
60% negative return on what i invested?  i was an idiot, what was i thinking
it was the worst investment ever.
I am going to HODL, but just because... i might as well at this point.
but i'll never buy any more bitcoin again.
i hate bitcoin.
and yes... even though i am hodling (just in case it does go up again) what i truly believe is that bitcoin will keep on crashing.
my opinion, it will be down to $4000 by the end of August
and then down to $2000 by 2020
bitcoin is the WORST decision i ever made, luckily i only invested what i could afford to lose, and also luckily, i diversified and put most of my investment money into real estate (which is up 11%) and stocks (which are up 6%).
so, over all, i am doing fine, its just being NEGATIVE 60% in an investment (even IF you can afford it) that sucks! more specifically, bitcoin sucks!
yes, there was a time when it was a good investment, but those days are over, from here on out (in my opinion) its just gonna keep crashing for at least 2 more years.
@_date: 2018-08-16 15:18:41
first of all science is true or not true based on facts, not a vote
so "consensus" in regard to science means nothing
secondly, the 97% number is mostly non-climate scientists
thirdly, almost no one is denying climate changes, but saying slight changes are man caused, bad, or that the "solutions" posed by the global warming alarmists will work is whats unproven.
so, be open minded, and perhaps look into all the evidence, pro and con, on global warming?
either way, best to you, and have a wonderful day, whatever the climate.

i bought bitcoin knowing it was a gamble.
i didn't buy more than i could afford to lose.
and it went down (as I knew it might).
i'm still hodling, just in case.
i'm just saying that, in my personal opinion, i think bitcoin will go down even more.

and i love the way they are so sneaky about hiding as much of the fees as they can

...and the price is still dropping
7 months of near-constant btc price dropping, 
and hey! look, after a VERY SHORT bull run, we are now down 15% this week
and quickly approaching an ATL for the already bad 2018.
but hey! nothing to see here, just move along, btc is doing just fine
@_date: 2018-08-15 17:40:28
oh you mean that exchange whose employees used insider trading to rip off their customers?
the same exchange that did an "internal investigation" and found those employees innocent?
so wait, we ALL know that coinable is a crooked exchange thats ripped off its customers with insider trading and manipulating access to trades, but now we're happy that coinbase is signing up even more suckers?
naw, not me.
fuck coinbase, and i will never celebrate their successes.
@_date: 2018-08-14 21:31:17
nothing wrong with FUD when things really are going poorly.
in fact, having some fear, when bitcoin is crashing hard, is a good reaction to what is actually going on.
yes, FUD for no reason is bad.
but FUD in a time when BTC has lost up to 70% of its total value in just a few months is totally logical.
i mean, you can believe that bitcoin will bounce back, and hey... i hope it does.
but being afraid that it might not recover, considering whats been happening lately is hardly irrational.
right now things could go bearish *or* bullish.
but actions like  positive outlook is the only option is looking at the world through rose colored glasses.
...and personally i am not a blind optimist and i like considering all options.
and having considered all the options, in my non-expert opinion, i think bitcoin will crash, crash, crash some more (all the way down to 2K is my personal guess).
as for your personal insults,
that is against the rules of r/bitcoin to engage in personal insults or name calling of fellow users.
as such, please stop breaking the rules of this subreddit, and please be polite to your fellow r/bitcoin members.
we can disagree on ideas, but we should always be polite  and respectful to one another.

what a strange comment
i mean, i talk about bitcoin
but some people on here, think that comments that are bearish on bitcoin are not to be allowed
and by simply saying a negative comment about bitcoin, people like you will say i am "trolling"
nope, i am not "trolling"
i simply think that bitcoin is doing poorly, and that bitcoin will continue to do poorly for (at least) the next 2 years.
thats just my OPINION
i don't claim to be an expert (in fact i am quite clear about the fact that i am NOT AN EXPERT)
and i'm also open and honest about the fact that i lost 60% of the money that i put into bitcoin.
But i'm not (according to people like you) allowed to hate bitcoin? or have a negative opinion about it?
sorry buddy, but its a free country, and i can politely express ANY opinion on bitcoin that I want to.
Plus, i am always polite to my fellow users on this subreddit (even if i may disagree with their ideas)
I just wish everyone could be as polite to me as i am to them (and i wish people would not engage in personal insults, as insulting your fellow members of r/bitcoin is against the rules of this subreddit)

no, what i am doing is like going to r/nba and saying "hey, interest is basketball is down 70% just this year alone, *maybe* interest in basketball is dying out for good, whatever the case, lets not act like basketball is 'going to the moon' in popularity, and lets look at and address this very real decline"
as for ANYONE on here telling a fellow user to "shove it up your ass"
that sort of thing is 100% against the rules of this subreddit
i mean, why even have rules like *don't personally insult your fellow users* if we are not going to even follow them?
@_date: 2018-08-20 23:41:51
all that legal stuff is cool and all
but seriously, you need to find out where the owner of this company is, and go to his house
do it every day
and put signs in front of his house
make him feel BAD, cause thats how hes made you feel
don't be violent towards him, but just ask him politely every day, at his home, at his job, when he is out for dinner with friends
oh, and park a car with a sign saying he is a thief in front of his house and his job
and where ever else he hangs out too
these rich tech billionaires don't car about us regular people
thats why they don't have real human customer support (as just one example)
this guy fucked you, now its time to make him remember that, every single day until he give you your btc back (which he could do with one phone call, but he doenst even care about you enough to do that).
make his life suck, and let us know how it comes out.
we're rooting for you, good luck!!!

@_date: 2018-08-29 05:56:54
with all the bouncing, i don't care about the lowest day of the month, but the monthly average
jan about 15k
feb about 11k
by june 6.5k
and so on
just gets worse and worse
by january 2019, my guess is 4k
@_date: 2018-08-23 21:19:06
i bought bitcoin starting in nov 2017
and now i am down 60%
yes, i did listen to people on here, and even read books on bitcoin, everyone was saying it would keep going higher, up to $40K (maybe even higher).
and guess what? I was so dumb that i listened to people who said that.
oh well...
i lost most of the money that i put into bit coin (which i accept full personal responsibility for).
i have not sold any of the bitcoin that i bought, and i will just hodl, but in my non-expert OPINION, i think that bitcoin will keep crashing (just like its done ALL of 2018)
...and its STILL crashing hard, worse and worse it gets.
oh well, the logical part of my brain knew it was a gamble from day one, and i only invested what i could afford to lose (but "afford" it or not, it still sucks to lose 60% of what you put into something). i learned my lesson, and i will never buy bitcoin again.
I HOPE it goes up, but it probably won't (i think)
I've been wrong before, obviously... so i'll just hodl in the meantime, and unless bitcoin goes to 20K again, i will continue to hate it, just as i do know.
@_date: 2018-08-29 23:24:46
i've got something "salty" for you
if you know what i mean?
wink wink nudge nudge
@_date: 2018-08-14 21:03:32
bitcoin is gonna go low
down into the dirt low
@_date: 2018-08-10 04:22:32
thats already the case
no one wants it
its just hodlers that are hodling on (for now) that keep it from totally crashing/dying
@_date: 2018-08-26 02:38:05
...and, its crashing, again.
@_date: 2018-08-30 02:18:29
yes, i hope that it works as it should
fingers crossed
@_date: 2018-08-23 20:38:38
oh great
first bitcoin loses 60% of the money that i put into it
and now bitcoin is yelling at me to STFU?
bitcoin is a dick
@_date: 2018-08-03 20:28:32
question for those, like me, who think bitcoin might be down to near nothing in the next few years
when exactly do you think bitcoin with crash and become worth next to nothing?
my guess is by the end of 2020 it will be over for bitcoin
what do you guys think?
will bitcoin make it to 2020?
or even as far as 2024?
@_date: 2018-08-06 20:43:35
facts are facts
 a fact can't be "wrong"
@_date: 2018-08-01 01:37:12
personally, i doubt that
i don't pretend to be an expert, but my non-expert opinion,
btc will continue to go down (even more than the minus 60% thats its already gone down the last 7 months) and i'm guessing that btc will be down to $2000 by the end of 2018
after that? who knows, but could go even lower?

one of the main rules of r/bitcoin is that we are not allowed to personally insult fellow users, nor are we to insult each other personally.
as such, i would invite you to read the rules of this subreddit, and even more than that, i would politely encourage you to follow them.
peace and love to you.

i'd LOVE to break even

when it costs more to mine than its worth, it will break
besides, who wants to buy an asset thats lost 70% of its value in just a few months
no wonder almost everyone wants to sell, and so few want to buy
@_date: 2018-08-06 19:19:25

This is a bitcoin discussion subreddit for those who are interested in bitcoin.
Its not a bitcoin fan club.
All opinions about bitcoin are discussed here.
All opinions about bitcoin are allowed here.
We all do not hold the exact same opinions on bitcoin.
Some of hate bitcoin, others love bitcoin, and everything in-between.
Some of us are bullish on bitcoin, others of us are bearish.
Some think that bitcoin will be around forever, others think its a dying technology who's best days are behind it.
and others, like me, want it to succeed, but feel like ultimately it will fail.
I don't pretend to know for sure, that is just my OPINION.
Stop acting like positive bitcoin comments are the only ones that should be shared on here, and definitely stop with the name calling and personal insults 
Please accept that a diversity of opinions on bitcoin should be allowed.
@_date: 2018-08-13 19:34:15


i do hate it
and i don't believe in it, but i will HODL (i lost so much already, i might as well ride it out)
and yes, if you sold your portion, then you are a wiser man than i
still, no matter what happens,  sucks 
and 
@_date: 2018-08-29 21:14:57
you are just making things up about me, that are 100% not true.
i didn't sell low
i didn't sell at all
i just bought
what i bought has gone down 60% in value
but i'm just hodling it 
i have ONLY bought, NEVER sold
so, please...
enough with the lies about me.  you don't know what youre talking about.
and then you insult me?  lol, you lie, and then personally insult a fellow member of r/bitcoin
insulting fellow members of r/bitcoin is against the rules here.
if a mod sees that sort of thing, they'll ban you.
personally, i won't report you, because i am all about love and peace, but you might want to start abiding by the rules, so that this sub can focus on talking about bitcoin, and not turn into a place where people personally insult each other.
peace and love to you! hope you can learn to be nicer.  aloha!

@_date: 2018-08-16 15:44:13


you said "consensus" as if the percentage in favor of a theory means its true or not


lots of good sites, i suggest you start with 
from there, where ever your own research takes you
i'm not telling you what to believe, just look beyond the obvious one-sided, mainstream narrative sites.
if you do, i think you might be surprised how much of the so-called "settled science" of global warming has been proven false over the last few years
@_date: 2018-08-20 23:45:14
thats why i've been predicting all month that by the end of august btc will be down to $4000
and that by 2020 it will be down to $2000 or less.
besides, if some shit like this happens at a real bank with fiat, you can go in there and talk to someone at the bak about that ...very same day.
with most crypto companies, they have no real customer service, its just an email that no one replies to
my new policy with any investment is to never do business with companies that do not tell you where they are located, and that do not offer human being tech support (no chat bot, not community forums, no webpages with FAQs) if a company does not have a human being i can talk to in case of an emergency or serious problem i will not do business with them, or trust them.
@_date: 2018-08-06 20:44:29
there are lots of things i do believe in
its just that bitcoin is not one of those things
@_date: 2018-08-14 22:19:56


on the other hand, many have just been pump and dump whales who have uses their wealth and assets to screw us regular investors out of even more money by manipulating the price 
i mean, i choose to buy bitcoin, so i blame myself
but i now know its a crooked system, rigid by tech billionaires and corrupt exchanges
i will not take a part in buying any more bitcoins as its too rigged and too crooked for my tastes.
anyway, thats just my opinion, and my thoughts.  i do thank you for your opinion, and for sharing your knowledge and outlook on bitcoin with me.
not to mention reading your comment reminds me that i like the actual people that are a part of r/bitcoin, i just hate bitcoin itself.
thank you!

@_date: 2018-08-21 03:34:51


doesnt matter
if something is a good investment, whatever reason you invest in it, it will go up in value
sadly, bitcoin is a bad investment, and has been since the start of 2018
but hey.. to each his own
i wish you the best
i will hold what i have
but i will never buy more, i hate bitcoin, and will never lose another penny to it. 
 
@_date: 2018-08-30 04:08:58


but the only opportune entry point that i am aware of was in the past
so, all i could advise is to not invest in bitcoin unless you have a time machine
my OPINION is that bitcoin will ONLY go down for years 
so my only advice, as a non-expert, is to not invest anything in bitcoin, as its just gonna go down, down, down, for some time.
thats my opinion.  Others can follow it or not.
but my opinion is that bitcoin can only lose money for the next few years, and my other opinion is that it might crash and make everyone holding it that much poorer.

once again
you sought me out, and you're writing to me, unsolicited.
you are also the one calling me names and insulting me...
but I'm the "troll"?
i did not seek you out, or do anything but reply politely to you.
i never insulted you, nor did i personally insult any other user of this subreddit, ever.
but, for some reason, you feel a need to write to me and insult me?
just my opinion, but that doesnt seem like good rediquette.
even the fact that i am polite is (for you) an excuse to insult me.
oh well....
I guess we'll just have to agree to disagree on this issue.
I'll stick with my opinion that us members of r/bitcoin should not personally insult one other,
and you can keep on saying or doing whatever it is that you believe in.
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:02:49
and, i do well with investing
making six percent with my stocks
and nearly ten percent returns on my real estate investments

act arrogant and insult us in online forums
tell us how much smarter you are

i am sure that the entire r/bitcoin subreddit benefits from attitudes like yours.

i am not ignorant
in fact, knowing that an asset that loses 60% of its value in a few months is in trouble is what i know
that you don't know it shows you appear to be in denial
@_date: 2018-08-30 02:51:54
well, i literally have people like u/diamondcuts17765 saying things like "I'm simply exposing your ignorance so that other readers won't be influenced by you"
influenced by ME???
and thats just one comment from the last 10 minutes.
people act like i am somehow some great influence on others, and that i am influencing so many people.
thats why i make it a point to say i'm not an expert, to make all those who think i'm such an influencer look even sillier.
and i make it a point to say its *just my opinion*.
and yet, i'll still get countless attacks or people saying that i don't know what i'm talking about in regard to bitcoin (i never said i did know what i was talking about)
i am (as you know) just a humble non-expert, simply sharing some opinions from my own brain.
no more, no less.
just one r/bitcoin member talking to my fellow members, and sharing my thoughts on the future or bitcoin 
Listen to me or not, i say... but get angry? (as so many seem to do) that i would advise against.
Life is short
be happy
enjoy each moment
and if you disagree with a reddit comment, just let it slip by, no need to get worked up, i say
just be a simple happy, easy-going guy like ghee99 is (thats my advice)
@_date: 2018-08-23 20:41:54

@_date: 2018-08-14 23:16:56


i was a noob once, and i lost 60% of the money i put into bitcoin.
I WISH SOMEONE HAD STOPPED ME FROM INVESTING ANYTHING INTO BITCOIN WHEN I DID.
Bitcoin sucks ...unless youre lucky enough to have been an early adopter, or if you are a pump-and-dump whale, or if youre a billionaire tech investor, or one of the corrupt bitcoin exchanges that engage in insider trading (which they all do).
but for the rest of us, its a system thats rigged AGAINST us.
from here on out, for the regular average investors, its just down, down, down (for the rest of 2018, at least)
i am not here to be part of a conspiracy to shield a "noob" from the truth
if anything, i want to protect the noobs from the losses that investing **now** in bitcoin will most likely bring them.
if you are a noob, first of all, learn all you can about bitcoin.  Just sit back, watch, study and learn.
secondly, in my opinion... *DO NOT INVEST NOW*, it looks like bitcoin is gonna keep crashing for quite some time.  
its already lost 70% of its value JUST THIS YEAR, and it looks like it will lose even more.
Best choice (once again, *in my opinion*) is if you are a noob, is to just sit this round of trading/buying out, wait and see what bitcoin does the rest of the year, and then (if you want to) consider buying some crypto assets IN VERY LIMITED AMOUNTS in early 2019

**bitcoin fanatic:** bitcoin is back, baby!
**me:**  (me after looking at the actual numbers) SMH, um... you do know that bitcoin is down 15%, and thats just *this* week?
**bitcoin fanatic:**  go to hell, bro, youre just spreading FUD.  bitcoin is up 10 million billion percent overall
**me:**  yes, it has risen a lot in the past, but thats no guarantee that it will bounce back.  Besides, its lost 70% of its value this year, and its STILL crashing, so there IS something to be worried about.
**bitcoin fanatic:** bitcoin is going to the moon, put your orders in for your lambos now, Macafee says 1million!!! HODL no matter what, if you disagree you are stupid and get the hell out of r/bitcoin
**me:** actually r/bitcoin is for all, its not a subreddit ONLY for those who think bitcoin is going to the moon.  Please be respectful to all members of this subreddit
**bitcoin fanatic:** you suck, ur mom gay! you need to watch some more videos on youtube about bitcoin, and besides, who cares if it makes money, i'm just in it for the tech.
**me:** OK, bro... thats cool that youre in it for the tech, as for me, i admire it for the tech, but i'm in it to increase my wealth in the process, too.  I want to make money on my investments.
**bitcoin fanatic:**  haha! you bought at $20K, youre an idiot, stupid late adopter, you are too stupid to even own bitcoin, get out!
**me:** No, i won't "get out" but i will be respectful when I share my opinion, and I hope you and others will be respectful towards me
**bitcoin fanatic:** no way, me and every other bitcoin fanatic will NEVER be respectful towards people like you, we will insult you first, and then we will downvote you into oblivion, just watch, we'll do it right now!!!

if you really want to be woke, sell your BTC too
mark my words, its gonna lost 20% in the next two weeks
if you want to buy again, let it finish its crash (which should be around january 2019)
then you can buy again, when it might be on the way back up
but from here on out, and for the next 5-6 months, bitcoin will just be getting less and less valuable each month
this deep deep crash is only half over, lots more dips to come
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:30:53

in my opinion, never again

bitcoin isn't going to die?
in january you said it was just chinese new year, and that bitcoin would come roaring back
in february, it crashed even lower than the previous month, and you said the crash was temporary and that we should HODL and "buy the dip"
in march, it crashed even lower than the previous month, and you said the crash was temporary and that we should HODL and "buy the dip"
in april, it crashed even lower than the previous month, and you said the crash was temporary and that we should HODL and "buy the dip"
in may, it crashed even lower than the previous month, and you said the crash was temporary and that we should HODL and "buy the dip"
in june, it crashed even lower than the previous month, and you said the crash was temporary and that we should HODL and "buy the dip"
in july, it crashed even lower than the previous month, and you said the crash was temporary and that we should HODL and "buy the dip"
now its august, bitcoin's price is crashing hard, and yet the bitcoin believers are still saying the crash is temporary and that we should still HODL and should still "buy the dip".
seriously, we are just going down, non-stop, for 7 months (with no end in sight).
i wonder if there will ever come a time when the bit coin believers ever do not say the crash is temporary and that we should HODL and "buy the dip"?
I have invested in many things in my life, but (by far) the worst investment i have ever made in my life was to put some of my money into bitcoin.
*bit*coin? more like *lose 65% of what you put into it* coin!

textbook dead cat bounce of a dying asset
bitcoin will continue to slide after this slight temporary uptick again, all the way down to the 4000s
anyway... thats my opinion.

yes, the last generation smart enough to buy some in time to really make some good money were all those who bought before the Summer of 2017
everyone after that has broken even (at best) or lost most of their money (more common)
@_date: 2018-08-21 03:47:23


EVERYBODY on here says that NOW
at the time it was approaching 20K EVERY ONE sid it was going to 40K or more (some even said up to one million)
so, i just felt the same as everyone else
i was an idiot, but so was every other person on here
thats why i know you can't trust any of the "experts"
and why i will never buy bitcoin again

*reddit advice, what to do with your bitcoin :*
prices are rising, you should HODL.
prices are crashing, you should HODL.
prices are staying the same, you should HODL.
prices are rising, it'll never stop, bitcoin is going to the moon.
prices are crashing, its temporary, bitcoin is going to the moon.
prices are staying the same, its temporary, bitcoin is going to the moon.
@_date: 2018-08-18 16:43:07
its going to be in the 4000s by the end of august
i've been saying this for weeks, people laugh
but just wait and see
i am not saying i want it to crash, i WISH it would go up, 
i'm just saying, in my opinion, i am totally sure i'll will just keep crashing, and crashing hard, for the next few weeks
basically, the rest of 2018 is going to be bad, very bad, even worse than its been already ...for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-29 21:46:33
i'm no expert, but my non-expert opinion is that bitcoin's value will continue to drop (overall) for the rest of 2018
@_date: 2018-08-14 23:36:13


nope, not at all
not even one iota
stop saying untrue things.
and hey... i am with you 100% in regard to following and developing economically viable alternative energy sources
they are great
its just that making up a play-pretend imaginary "problem" like global warming as the reason is just silly.


ugh, first of all, consensus isn't science, secondly (as i said before) 
"has the earth ever naturally cooled or warmed?
yes, it always has"
i'm not denying that climate changes, i am simply saying its not a big deal, and the so-called "solutions" haven't been show to have any effect, other than being incredibly expensive and freedom-limiting.
so regrardes of what opinion is the most popular, that doesnt make the fear mongering of global warming alarmists something that we should take seriously
i remember reading a poll that said the majority of Americans believe in angels, is that now scientific proof of the existence of angels?
of course not, majority opinion and scientific reality are not the same thing.
the strangest thing, to me, is why so many like you fight for belief in global warming alarmism?
...as opposed to actually researching all the information on the subject.
seriously, most global warming alarmists have a belief systems that are seemingly more aligned with a religious belief systems than the scientific method
@_date: 2018-08-01 09:03:25

Tron? thats a crypto asset now?
I thought was a movie from the 80s!
@_date: 2018-08-30 04:55:32
no offense
but the so-called "experts" on here said in January 2018, when the crash really started, that it was just temporary due to chinese new year or some such
every month, the reddit "experts" have some excuse for lower prices, and they always say it will rebound any day now
the excuses are always bs, and the rebound never happens
im tired of these experts saying because it went up a lot in the past, that means it will go up again
thats not how markets work
part performance don't guarantee future results.
i mean.. yes, it might go back up again, but it also might go down to nothing and die
personally, i think its gonna go down a lot more (although, i don't think it will die)
I guess we'll just have to wait and see, but right now, things look bleak
@_date: 2018-08-17 00:38:02
youre not too far from the Truth
i watch [THIS]( every time i masturbate!
@_date: 2018-08-04 03:39:48
yeah, its neither fun nor interesting to follow bitcoin these days
as each new month just brings more losses
watching it go up was great
even up and down is ok
but this whole year its just down, down, down (with an occasional dead cat bounce from time to time)
its not enjoyable to watch my money grow lesser and lesser as the year progresses
I am down 60%
...but it could be worse, I know others who have lost even more.
@_date: 2018-08-14 03:33:24
bitcoin to be $4K by the end of 2018
after that, who knows?
but i bet its gonna keep crashing till its down to $1-2K
@_date: 2018-08-06 19:21:20
i am polite
and i don't engage in name calling or insults towards my fellow users of r/bitcoin
i do express an opinion that bitcoin is going down (I don't KNOW that its going down, but thats my OPINION which i am free to express)
hey... i HOPE bitcoin goes back up, i just do not think (in my non-expert opinion) that it will
am i not allowed to express an opinion like that?
@_date: 2018-08-29 21:24:08
i politely type in comments talking about feeling bearish about bitcoin
and you think thats "angry"?
interesting how you think
@_date: 2018-08-06 21:10:10
who said i didn't invest conservatively?
just so you know, i only invested what i could afford to lose
nonetheless, its sad to see bitcoin crashing so hard and for so long, and so relentlessly
i am not pretending to be an expert
i am just saying, in my non-expert opinion, that i think bitcoin will keep crashing till it hits $2000 (after that, who knows?)
but simply sharing my onion gets me attacked by some, i wonder why?
@_date: 2018-08-23 00:51:56

yes, we'll be down to $5500 by the week-end
@_date: 2018-08-15 17:22:57
i should sell it
but as i only invested what i could afford to lose
and as i knew it was a gamble all along
i'll just hodl (just in case)
although, in my opinion, i think its just gonna keep going down
@_date: 2018-08-14 22:08:33
well, i am glad that you can tell good investors from bad just by their reddit comments
but i will actually agree with you, when it comes to bitcoin, i lost 60% of what i put in, so yup... thats bad investing
on the other hand, i only invested what i could afford to lose, and i only invested a small percent of my total investments into bitcoin (so in those ways, i was wise).
all in all, i did lose 60% of what i invested in bitcoin,
but i am up 6% on my stock market investments,
and i am up 11% on my real estate investments.
so at the end of the day, i am ahead.
but when it comes to crypto, yesssss... i am terrible at investing!
and not only that, i am still HODLing, but i HATE bitcoin now
i hate it
but i'll still HODL stupid.shitty.annoying bitcoin ...for now.
I'll not invest any *more* money into bitcoin, it sucks!
...and i will just focus on the real money makers like my real estate investments, etc.
@_date: 2018-08-14 19:33:42

@_date: 2018-08-06 21:06:26

and people will be saying $2000?  I WISH it were $2000
@_date: 2018-08-06 20:13:25


i never said that
i don't even think of btc as a crypto *currency*
i think of it as a crypto asset
and hey... i don't have a "plan", i just bought some btc hoping it would increase in value
and i'm on here, not to push any agenda or plan, i'm just honestly sharing my opinion
and my opinion (which i freely admit could be wrong) is that bitcoin is going into the toilet

i haven't bought any bitcoin since the first quarter of 2018
i'm just sitting here HODLing what i bought in late 2017 and early 2018.
a month ago i was down 40%
a few days ago , i was down 50%
now i am down 60%
my best guess is that i'll be down 70-80 maybe even 90% in the months ahead
but hey... you never know?  I **HOPE** that you are correct!
whatever the case, thanks for your opinion and insight!
@_date: 2018-08-15 00:13:28

why worry about losing thousands of dollars?
no one likes to just lose a bunch of their money for nothing in return, whether they can afford it or not

i can't think of any major investment ever that lost 70% of its value in a few months, and then recovered and thrived afterwords
i'm sure its happened, but its rare and the exception
as such, i think its over for bitcoin (in my non-expert opinion)

agree 100%
personally, i don't think bitcoin will ever get to 7K again
my best guess is that it will be at 2-3K by 2020 (perhaps even less)
@_date: 2018-08-03 20:30:52
i'm thinking down to $2000 by 2020
@_date: 2018-08-11 21:41:54

i doubt btc will ever be worth $0
mostly likely, in my opinion, btc will be worth a few hundred by 2022
@_date: 2018-08-29 20:42:48

nope, in my opinion, it will continue downward, like it has ALL of 2018
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:00:49
whats up with me?
oh, i'm having a nice day, how about you?
@_date: 2018-08-06 20:31:45


i hope so!
but i'm also wise enough to know that isn't guaranteed
technology moves at a lightning pace these days
and many are the old technologies that are left behind in the dust
I hear a lot of people saying they will hold onto btc for another 10 years, because then it will *really* be worth something.
at that point btc will be two decades old
another words, they are betting that a 20 year old technology will be worth even more in 2028 or so
maybe it will be... but any reasonable person will have to admit that it might not be
@_date: 2018-08-11 21:44:19
it'll keep crashing until it hits 4k, maybe even go down to 2k
by the end of 2018
@_date: 2018-08-16 05:15:39


yes, when u/kaiwanxiaode said "Even at 25 if it’s all the time it’s pathetic,"
it made me think, and i was like... yeah, he's right.  being high ALL the time (at any age) is pathetic
and yes... to be high all the time and rich is better than being high all the time and not rich.
but, being not being high all the time, in my opinion, is the best of all.
i mean, look at snoop, he is rich, but clearly a mess, and he looks dirty, and even seems like he smells.
on the other hand, if you care about success, then look at Donald Trump (he neither drinks nor smokes, at all) and he is the most successful man on the planet.
TV star, billionaire businessman, and President of the USA
Not saying people shouldnt get high if they want to, I'm just saying... for me, being high is not anything that interests me at all!
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:54:47

@_date: 2018-08-06 20:23:22


 
Then again, as someone who (unlike so many on here) is not emotionally invested or overly-attached to whether or not bitcoin succeeds or fails, i might be seeing more clearly than most.
For example, I do HOPE that bitcoin succeeds and goes "to the moon"
but i also know that its a technology that is already a decade old (which is *ancient* in todays modern, vastly changing world).
Will someone come up with something better in a few years, and make the use of bitcoin obsolete?
Maybe? maybe not?
I mean, there was a time when a Sony walkman was king of the hill
And then one simple technological invention, the iPod, made the walkman an unused and forgotten dinosaur.
It could easily go either way with bitcoin.
Yes, we all agree that bitcoin *could* replace fiat, but the other side of that is that something *could* replace bitcoin.
Right now (In 2018) the only ones making money on bitcoin are the ones selling, and the pump and dump billionaires. 
Will regular people be able to make money again on bitcoin?
I HOPE so... but that ship may have sailed and it may just be a slow decent into the toilet for people who are HODLing bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:59:33

wow, why so serious?
and why so hostile?
and why so conspiratorial?
i mean, i lost 60% of what i put into bitcoin (in only a few months)
so, now i hate bitcoin.
buying it was the stupidest thing i ever did
i wish i never bought stupid, shitty bitcoin
oh and look at the last few weeks, its crashing even harder than usual
so yah... i am totally bearish on bitcoin
i think it will go down to 4K by the end of august
you can agree or disagree (its a free country)
but why so many think that i can't share a negative opinion on bitcoin is beyond me
ALL opinions on bitcoin are allowed on here
and MY opinion is that bitcoin sucks and that it will continue to crash, crash, crash
and go down, down, down
its crooked, and the whole system is manipulated by pump and dump whales, tech billionaires, and crooked insider-trading exchanges
it you can't see that, you are blind
 
@_date: 2018-08-15 23:10:36
what other professions NEED degrees?
well, in my opinion, NO other professions NEED degrees
many professions NEED those involved in them to have specific information or skills, but to say that a degree-issuing university is the only place that someone can learn needed job skills is incorrect.
Unfortunately, the govt makes laws saying that the universities or specific organizations are the ones who get to decide who gets to do certain jobs.
for example, why are doctors so expensive?
its because the AMA and the universities decide (in advance) how many people they will allow to become doctors.
And they seriously restrict those numbers.
Less doctors overall means that those who are doctors are in higher demand and can charge more.
If it were left up to the free market, we would have many more doctors, and the price of a doctors services would come way down (basic supply and demand)
so, in some cases its the govt colluding with education and private organizations to affect the market in ways that are actually detrimental to individual citizens (even though these govt policies enrich these private organizations and individuals)
I mean seriously... why is the govt involved in limiting the number of people who can be doctors in the USA?  If anything, they should encourage there to be more doctors.
Thats just one example, but there are no positions that NEED degrees, although there are certain professions where one must show a proficiency and knowledge to do the work of that profession (this could be everything from realtor, to electrician, to pharmacist, to banking, etc).
That the govt allows universities (and their degree system) be the gatekeepers that get to decide who is even allowed to do certain professions is ridiculous.

yes, those who bought years ago are doing fine
sadly (in my opinion) bitcoin has peaked, and its only downhill now
after all, past gains are not a guarantee of future gains.
i could be wrong (obviously) but i do believe that bitcoin is dying
either way, i do HOPE that youre correct, and i thank you for your input and thoughts!

yes, thats all part of the AMA number, there is a pre-set number of doctors that are issued licenses in the USA
if more than the pre-set number apply, even if they are 100% qualified, they will not be issued licenses or allowed to practice medicine in the USA
why is the us govt allowing a private organization to keep qualified doctors from practicing medicine?
because the AMA "donates" millions of dollars to politicians and PACs
you can agree or disagree with the authors of these two articles, but they make good points:

then i started to see how bad bitcoin was doing, so I said it would be down to $2000 by 2020
I changed my mind, and now i think it will be down to just a few hundred by 2020
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:24:33
hey, its all fact based information
i am less obsessed with which news source a story comes from, what i care about is the story true and fact based

all day, every day, hundreds and hundreds of bullish posts
and they all got upvoted and cheered on
but i say an occasional bearish comment, and i get personally insulted, verbally attacked, and told "we get it"
wow, talk about a lack of diversity of opinions being allowed
and bullish evidence?
only evidence i see if bitcoin losing nearly 70% of its total value in 2018
and thats evidence of a bear!
you can think that being bearish on an assets thats lost more than half of its value in a few months makes me a troll, its a free country, think what you want.
but look at my posts, and those who reply
you'll notice i NEVER personally insult other r/bitcoiners or engage in name calling (as they do to me)
so, look at that, and how i am polite and they are often rude, and *then* you decide who the real trolls are?
@_date: 2018-08-27 22:31:19
its still crashing
i mean... a couple weeks of staying the same doesnt mean its not crashing overall.
i mean, lets not forget... in january it was nearly 20K, and now its 6500 or so.
so yes there are ups and down, but the general trend for *all of 2018* is downward.
@_date: 2018-08-30 04:44:03
people bring up the past, as if past results were proof of future returns
thats not how markets work.
i don't deny that bitcoin, in the past, went up a lot
and i admit that buying it in the past was a good choice.
i am just saying that now, in my opinion, those times has passed, and its only downhill in price from here on out.
thats my OPINION!

seriously, why are you leftists always obsessed with race?
the rest of us don't even care about race or what race someone is

btc hasn't crashed due to legal or technical problems, but...
its about to crash for good due to ever-lessening value
it just keeps crashing, lower and lower
you all can "buy the dip" all you want, but in my opinion, btc will be down in the hundreds by 2020
@_date: 2018-08-29 04:17:31
yes, in the past, we rose A LOT
that ended in 2018
since2018 we've been crashing hard
we'll continue to crash the rest of 2018 
it'll keep going lower for at least the next 6 months (minimum) to 2 years in my opinion

it took 60% of my money away from me

@_date: 2018-08-14 23:05:47


i did not shift anything in my argument.
please re-read my original comment, and the more recent one, too
same exact ideas expressed in both.


never said renewable energy was bad.  its great!  there are LOTS of reasons to have cleaner and more renewable energy sources (its just the an irrational fear of global warming is not the reason to do it.)
Cleaner air, and cheaper energy, and a million other reasons are all *good reasons* for renewable energy, its jut that global warming alarmism is not the reason why we should have cleaner, more efficient energy.


you do understand that science is based in facts and the scientific method, it has nothin to do with **consensus**
we don't vote on something to decide if its scientifically true or ask scientist what their consensus is to settle scientific debates.  we seek *proof* through actual *evidence*, and there is no evidence that shows the fears of the global warming alarmists have any merit.
same with "the majority of the world" believing in global warming.  thats just proof of a dedicated media pushing a message.  thats not proof of a problematic global warming.
the the *majority of the world* once believed the sun revolved around the earth, majority opinion is not how we decide scientific matters.

in America is you use the term "football" to refer to soccer
people will look at you funny and think youre an idiot
basically, speak the language of the country you are in.
if you are in the USA, soccer is what we call that game where they use their feet to kick a round ball into a goal
@_date: 2018-08-18 21:25:58
oh, yes
it all makes sense now
its kinda like if a graph is a reverse bart simpson, but its an alternate tuesday, then that means that a green moon-candle is coming in the next quarter.
unless of course, you've spotted John McAfee driving a Lambo on the Mt Gox access road.
if that happens, then btc will do a double moon roller coaster pump and dump before settling down to an ATH
@_date: 2018-08-10 04:19:55
if this chart is true
then its another 18-24 months of prices crashing
might as well sell off whatever you have now, and come back at the end of 2019

early adopters and really anyone who bought before november 2017 is doing fine
its just that the big bitcoin \*goldrush\* is now over and its only downhill from here on out (at least for quite some time).
@_date: 2018-08-06 19:38:38
yes, in the past btc was down, and then came back up
and sure... i do HOPE that happens again
but i am a savvy enough investor to know that just because btc rebounded in the past does not mean it will rebound yet again
@_date: 2018-08-29 20:33:41
everything you say is 100% true
i can't wait to see how, in 2020 when bitcoin is at 4K, there will be people cheering that, and saying "yes, it seems low compared to how it was last year, but remember WAY BACK when, it was only a few cents, and now its $4000, so lets have a party"
seriously, i don't get these people.
7K sucks,
and all of 2018 has sucked for bitcoin
there is NO point in even thinking about being happy until bitcoin is up to 20K again
and heres a clue for those "to the moon" types, its NEVER going up to 20K again, ever!
@_date: 2018-08-21 05:03:24

@_date: 2018-08-04 21:02:15
oh, youre making yourself and other early adopters an "elite class"
and your opinions are wonderful, but us "lower classes" need to be quiet?
sorry buddy, thats not how this subreddit works
we are all equal, and all free to share our own opinions... we just need to do so politely, and not insult each other in the process (hint, hint).
anyway, wishing you the best as i polite urge you not to try to silence the voices of others.

i already read a whole long book on bitcoin
it was called "Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond (Unabridged)"
 
Chris Burniske &amp; Jack Tatar
and it said bitcoin was bullish
so, then after all my studying, i lost 60% of the money i put into bitcoin
i might look into shorting, but just to learn
i don't want to be an amateur bitcoininvester again
i just want to get as far from any new bitcoin investing as i can (my past bitcoin invested resulted in negative 60% returns, not cool)

took a dump right onto the heads of those of us who own BTC
@_date: 2018-08-17 00:05:26


i never said you could
and i am not taking it out on anyone here (if you notice, i am always polite to my fellow bitcoin users, and i NEVER personally insult others, even though many on here personally insult me)
i am just sharing my opinions, and warning others of things that need to be said
if anything, i am doing a favor to noobs about the volitility/danger of bitcoin
and to anyone else who is wanting to share ideas, i offer a non-typical, but needed viewpoint on here
so, a variety of opinions and engaged posters makes r/bitcoin a better community (as opposed to what some people want, just positive-only opinions on bitcoin to be expressed)
@_date: 2018-08-13 16:36:32


i humbly disagree
i'll admit to not being an expert, but i don't see it hitting a bottom until it gets to 4k
...perhaps even lower than that
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:05:52


i'm not crying
i'm just sharing an opinion on bitcoin, based on its performance for ALL of 2018, that I think bitcoin will keep crashing
why are you so opposed to other opinions (besides your own) being expressed on here?
as for comments like "If you bought ATH and sold now it's because you are stupid"
I can only say the following:
 lets make fun of those who have bought recently
thats a great strategy for bitcoin and the bitcoin community.
the early adopters who made their money (like you) now insult and make fun of new arrivals and those who have taken a financial hit.
yeah, great plan!
let me know how that works out for you?
and also...
one of the main rules of r/bitcoin is that we are not allowed to personally insult fellow users, nor are we to engage in insults or name calling.
as such, i would invite you to read the rules of this subreddit, and even more than that, i would politely encourage you to follow them.
peace and love to you

i will admit that i am not an expert, thats why i ask others
but i do think that it reached its ATH, last december and from here on out its just a slow slide lower and lower
thanks for your opinion, however!
as for those who (like me) feel it will crash, when do you think that will happen?
@_date: 2018-08-30 03:25:10
i'm not passive aggressive.
i'm about as straight forward and direct as you can get.
i simply share my opinion that i think bitcoin will continue to do poorly
i am very clear to say i am not an expert and its just my opinion.
you can't really be more direct or honest than i am in my posts.
and yet... there are those saying i have a secret motive (be it concern trolling, or even those who say i'm a secret agent working for "the whales" to manipulate prices with FUD, etc, etc etc)
lots of consiricay theories, 
but seriously, i am not an expert, and i admit that i lost 60% of what i put into bitcoin
so, who would even listen to me in regard to buying bitcoin?  who am i trying to influence by saying i lost money, and that i'm not an expert (and that i didn't even own bitcoin until nov 2017).
Seriously... you guys are overthinking this way too much.
so let me be crystal clear.
I am relatively new.
i never bought bitcoin until late 2017.
i stopped buying in feb 2018.
i lost 60% of the money that i put into bitcoin.
i am bearish on bitcoin's future prospects.
i think that bitcoin will continue to crash for the rest of 2018.
You can agree or disagree, but that so many get so upset by my simply sharing a totally non-expert opinion just makes those who are upset look like the silly ones, not me.
@_date: 2018-08-14 23:56:32
and your proof of this is?
@_date: 2018-08-06 18:06:36
i hope you sold when it was 20K
if not, you lost 65% or so from your all time high
either way, btc was great for anyone who was an early adopter
anyone who has bought this year (or even late last year) has lost a ton of money
there was a time when btc was a great opportunity
but now, unless youre a tech billionaire, or a rich whale who pumps and dumps, the good times are gone, and its all downhill from here (in my opinion)
@_date: 2018-08-15 21:33:06
yes, i have invested in stocks (I use vanguard, and they have done great, and for very low fees)
as for real estate, i am a realtor, so i come across deals from time to time, and have purchased a rental property that makes me money, and has also risen in value.  i am also in the process of looking for a new investment property, too.
if you don't believe me, thats on you, i can't be responsible for your mind if it wants to believe untrue things

@_date: 2018-08-14 18:44:54
i'm not a billionaire
but the billionaire whales are getting richer using pump and dump schemes and playing the fools who think that BTC will go to the moon.
in reality, bitcoin isn't going to the moon, its going to the toilet.
yes, i did buy BTC, but only what i could afford to lose
and luckily my stocks are doing fine (about 6% positive returns)
and my real estate investments have increased in value by about 10%
so, even though my smaller investment in bitcoin is down 60%, I'll be fine because i was careful from the start.
of course, that bitcoin is doing so poorly, and will crash even more the rest of the year sucks, but hey... i will just hodl what have
i hate bitcoin
but fuck it, i rolled the dice, and in the case of bitcoin, it turned out to be a piece of shit loser of an investment (but since it was not my only investment, i am protected from bitcoin's poor performance).
@_date: 2018-08-21 19:46:46
i will never buy it again
although, who knows?
its a million to one shot, but i am going to hodl (what i already have just sitting there in my ledger wallet), and with an amazing amount of luck, i might become well off via bitcoin after all
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:41:35
i didn't sell
i bought
and now i am just hodling
@_date: 2018-08-18 16:39:35
yes, this proves, even now, that the power of bitcoin is not in our hands, and that its price is controlled by wall street and big institutions
the regular person will always lose in a system totally controlled by big wall street interests
the days of regular people being able to make money in bitcoin are over
@_date: 2018-08-29 04:09:09

i'll just HODL
i'm smart, with crypto assets, i just bought what i could afford to lose (my real investments are in real estate and the stock market where i am up 11% and 6% respectively).
with bitcoin, i knew it was a gamble, and i "rolled the dice"
i'll HODL and see what happens, oh course... I hope bitcoin goes "to the moon"
but what i believe it that it will crash more and more

next bull run?
nothing personal, but i think bull runs are over for btc
from here on out, in MY opinion, bitcoin is just going to go down, down down!
I've been hearing this "bitcoin will go to the moon any second now" every single day for over 7 months
and honestly, i just do not believe it any more
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:17:43

i didn't say you "should" believe me
believe whatever you want to.
i am just saying, in my opinion, that "bitcoin is in a death spiral
it may be able to pull out, or not
but in the short term, things are bad for bitcoin
and the price will continue to crash for some time"
you can listen to my opinion or not
its just an opinion, my opinion
i never said it was better than anyone else's opinion
its just what i think will happen, and what i think will happen is that I THINK that bitcoin will continue to go down, down, down!!!
@_date: 2018-08-22 00:36:25
no, its my fault
i admit that, time and time again
over and over

@_date: 2018-08-21 03:15:07


but stupid shitty bitcoin whose value all over the place and has lost 70% of its value just this year is whats going to replace fiat?
yeah right
bitcoin is shit
its a stupid investment vehicle for day traders, but it has no real value other than as a gamble
and its the worst gamble ever, as the regular guy gets screwed every time by pump and dump whales and tech billionaires, and corrupt insider trading exchanges
its a total suckers bet for they average man
i learned my lesson, i'll never be suckered by bitcoin investing again
and day to day use?
naw, no one wants to use this overly-complicated, slow, yo-yoing asset as currency
@_date: 2018-08-05 15:23:55
yes, this entire year (2018) is just a big crash
pump and dump whale and tech billionaires manipulate the market constantly 
they buy up large sums, then sell when the price rises
who gets fucked? the little guy
just one more reason not to buy unless you are a whale
everyone new is getting screwed over
new investors will stay away, as btc is just a sucker's bet at this point
@_date: 2018-08-29 21:35:54
i have only bought
i have never sold
hilarious that you would lie like that and say i sold.
although, its kinda weird of you, too.
oh well...
i have only bought, and now i hodl
sadly, the value of bitcoin has gone down 60% since i bought
i was foolish to buy bitcoin, but i learned from my mistake
i will never buy any more bitcoin again.

look at my membership status, i am a bitcoin member
and a troll?
by being polite, and suggesting that others follow (as i do) our own rules that say we are not allowed to call each other names and engage in persona insults?
What i am doing is not troll behavior
its just good rediquette.
I would politely suggest that you look up the definition of the word "troll"

i never lost money to a hack
i did lose most of the money i put into bitcoin though
@_date: 2018-08-29 17:58:43
just like that, we're crashing downward, again.
@_date: 2018-08-14 22:33:49


yes, i mean... i am negative 60% for what i put into bitcoin
i am at positive 6% for what i put into the stock market
i am at positive 11% for real estate
and just to have some liquid assets, i keep some in the bank (the bank money is only making 1.5% interest, but thats still better than the negative 60% that bitcoin lost).
so to answer your question
yes, i think its great to have money in safer investments, as opposed to putting any more into a huge money loser like bitcoin (not to mention, bitcoin is losing more with each month, whereas my other investments continue to grow slowly and steadily)
@_date: 2018-05-11 22:58:45
fucking bitcoin
once again, going deep, deep, deep into the toilet
what a fucking waste!
@_date: 2018-08-14 23:27:42
yes, i bought in parts
i averaged out from 7K to 20K in what i paid at different points
my average price was about 14-15K  ...or so.
meaning, i lost about 60% of what i paid, compared to what its worth now
worst investment in my entire life
lost 60% in only a few months, and its STILL crashing hard!
@_date: 2018-08-06 19:35:31
spend it?
no thanks
i bought what i could afford to lose
i lost 60% of my value already
at this point, i figure i'll probably lose the rest, but hey... you never know, I'm gonna HODL on the what i have just in case
@_date: 2018-08-14 23:53:24
you'll be the one feeling ignorant when its september and bitcoin is down to 4K
@_date: 2018-08-03 21:32:48

nov 2017
and i never claimed to be an expert, in fact (time and time again) I say that I'm not an expert, and that my predictions are just my *personal opinions*.
i don't claim *any* expertise, I just share my opinions.
my opinions are bearish.
and yet, apparently just having a bearing opinion gets me insulted and verbally attacked on here non-stop.
so much for having tolerance for a variety of opinions.
And yes, you (and others say the bear market is almost over) my opinion is different.  I think it will be a bear market until at least 2020 (and that it will be a hard bear market for the rest of 2018, with 2018 finishing around $4000 or less).
@_date: 2018-08-11 11:40:35

@_date: 2018-08-30 02:17:53

i hope it goes up too

@_date: 2018-08-15 20:57:21


lol, bitcoin sucks
i'm NEVER buying again
its just gonna go mostly down, for the next couple of years, perhaps longer
unless someone wants to short bitcoin (and profit off the misery of others) then its best to stay away from bitcoin, as the price will only go down, down, down
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:21:15
i'm a pessimist now (I USED TO BE an optimist on bitcoin, no longer, its in deep trouble), and I've been on here for years!

and no, it doesnt take balls, you just do not sell (easy)
@_date: 2018-08-21 03:23:32


i don't know enough to believe in them or not
i mean, it seems illogical that they would succeed, as it seems overly complicated, unstable, slow, and at a decade in age, technologically backward.
one person figured out how to hack it, or someone comes up with a better crypto asset and it seems like it could all just "poof" and be worth near-zero.
but hey... i do know enough to know that i don't know much about crypto at all, yet.
I do hope you are correct that some great products come out in the next 18 months.
I am less optimistic, but i hope that i'm wrong and youre correct.
the future sure seems like it will be interesting!
@_date: 2018-08-30 05:13:51
no idea what that means
but i am stuck with a "bag of bitcoins" now
that might as well be a bag of shit, considering the way bitcoin keeps going down!

its a suckers game from here on out
@_date: 2018-08-19 03:06:41
HODL on to that lawnmover
it might have lost a lot of its value lately, but its going to go to the moon any day now
@_date: 2018-08-11 21:49:40
no idea what that means, but i don't "hold bags" of any man
i am 100% straight
but hey... if you enjoy having men *hold your bags*, its a free country, do what ever you want
nothing wrong with being a "bag holder", its just not my thing
i prefer to hold a "taco" (if you know what i mean, wink, wink)
as for my own "bags" i will let a lady hold them, but never will i allow a man to "hold my own bags"
my bags are only for ladies to see and touch!
either way, i wish you the best, and peace to you!!!

@_date: 2018-08-29 21:41:52
you are 100% total liar
why would you even come on here to lie?
seems weird.
but just so you know, i have ONLY bought
yes, i have lost 60% of the value of what i bought
but i'm hodling everything i ever bought, and will just hodl on for now
i have never sold or even used bitcoin, ever.
i just bought it, and then i put it on a ledger, and now i just watch its value go down practically every time i check
yes, i do hate bitcoin, but i do also own it, and i am hodling what i own
of course... that someone like you would come on here just to lie about me is hilarious
although, i have to admit, when you do things like that it does make you look kinda pathetic
@_date: 2018-08-08 01:10:28
i never told anyone on here to "shut up"
not once
You are mistaken.
as for labrons nickname being the "goat"
@_date: 2018-08-13 16:38:50
i am speaking for myself
i put MY money in, and then "poof" within a few months 60% of my money was gone
basically, anyone who bought from late 2017 onward is losing their money big time
early adopters have done ok, the rest of us have gotten fucked
i hate bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-08-14 19:04:14
hey, its just my opinion
 i don't censor my opinions
my opinion is that bitcoin is in a death spiral
it may be able to pull out, or not
but in the short term, things are bad for bitcoin
and the price will continue to crash for some time
@_date: 2018-08-21 06:59:00
i don't know enough about investing to short
i was too dumb to avoid bitcoin, now you want me to short?
no thanks!
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:18:56


bitcoin is crashing, and will be crashing for the next 5 months (at least)
best thing is to not have any money in bitcoin right now
just wait till the crashing is done, which won't be until 2019

i'm not "pushing" my views onto anyone
i shared my opinion on a subreddit
in a thread with 414 other comments (most of whom are by people who have super positive things to say about bit coin)
personally, i feel bearish about bitcoin
and i hate bitcoin
thats just my opinion
i don't try to shut down other people's opinions, even if they are opinions that are different than mine
as such, i would ask for the same acceptance and tolerance from you
@_date: 2018-08-29 03:53:05
bitcoin is a total joke now
i agree with you!
@_date: 2018-08-06 21:29:36


with my stock investments I make about positive 6% a year
my real estate investments have been even better, gaining almost 10% per year the last decade
as for bitcoin i am at negative 65% on my investment in just 7 months (and its still going down)
i can only speak for myself, but i am totally happy with the economy and my investments EXCEPT for the one big money-loser in my portfolio which is bitcoin
and yes, I will HODL, but i also know it could go to next-to-nothing, just as likely as it could rise (in my non-expert opinion)
nonetheless, thank you for your polite and intelligent insight
and hey... its not that i hate bitcoin, i WANT it to do well (I just do not personally believe it will)
@_date: 2018-08-16 18:45:23
hey, do your own research
but if you really are curious, here is yet another article that uses many scientific sources, including NASA 
oh, and whatever happened to those scientific reports that ALL the ice in the arctic would be gone between 2008-2018?
guess that bit of "science" was a bit alarmist, wouldn't you say?
@_date: 2018-08-14 22:45:23


yes, the ideas are the same, i am not going to write the same thing over and over
but, cut and paste or not, truth is truth.
and, you spend all your time critiquing who you claim the source is, and yet... there is nothing on those sites that you can show to be false.
and as i said, the earth's climate changes from time to time, it always has
that doesnt prove man did it
and hey... even if we did, there is no proof that its an overall bad thing
and hey... even IF it were, there is no proof that the so-called "solutions" proposed by the global warming alarmists would do anything but waste money and enrich the people pushing these busted theories.
but hey... if you want to say that miami had a higher water level and now that means that world is ending go for it
but if you want the truth, i would suggest you do some research on your own, and not just from pro-global warming alarmist sites.

@_date: 2018-08-07 23:15:43
no one from late 2017 to today bought below 6K
so millions of people have lost huge amounts of value
and the way bitcoin is going now, we might lose it all
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:30:01
me losing all my money is good for bitcoin?
in that case, bitcoin sucks even more than i thought!
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:23:57
oh i don't care
i am already emotionally detached from bitcoin
i am still hodling, but at this point i don't really care, i'm just an uninvolved observer
just here to see what happens with this disaster
so whether it goes up (unlikely) or crashes down even harder (which is what i predict) i'm just sitting here with my popcorn watching the shitshow that is bitcoin 2018
@_date: 2018-08-08 01:54:01
end of July we were well into the 8Ks and it looked like we might even break 9K
we are in a hard crash, and below 6500
NOT a good day (or week) for bitcoin
in fact, ALL of 2018 has sucked
but today was a huge dip, and its still going
will it ever end?
@_date: 2018-08-16 21:10:15

@_date: 2018-08-11 12:02:23
too much bad will and bitterness amongst people who own bitcoin
no one likes buying something that loses 70% of its value this year
i'm gonna hodl
but bitcoin?
its the worst.investment.ever
i'm not buying any more of this shit again
total waste and value loser for sure
not to mention, in my OPINION bitcoin will go down to 4k or less by end of this year
but every time i express a negative/bearish outlook i'm attacked on here
its lame to attack me because i feel like bitcoin sucks
@_date: 2018-08-06 18:23:41
youre assuming that the entire technology community will never come up with anything better than bitcoin.
btc is already a decade old technology (which in tech terms is ancient).
will someone invent something better before bitcoin rebounds?
if so, its the end of bitcoin as a valuable asset.
i mean, sony walkmans dominated the market for a couple of decades, and then someone invented an iPod and that was the end of walkmen.
if this sort of thing happens to crypto assets, then bye bye bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-30 02:27:34
concern troll is someone who pretends to be concerned about something he doesnt really care about.
but hey... its not me expressing any concern
its those who reply to me, and then i might reply to some of them (but even when they are rude, you'll notice i'm polite in tone and words)
but i'm not passive aggressive like a "concern troll"
i'm about as straight forward and direct as you can get.
there is no trolling with me.
i simply share my opinion that i think bitcoin will continue to do poorly
i am very clear to say i am not an expert and its just my opinion.
you can't really be more direct or honest than i am in my posts.
and yet... there are those saying i have a secret motive (be it concern trolling, or even those who say i'm a secret agent working for "the whales" to manipulate prices with FUD, etc, etc etc)
lots of consiricay theories, 
but seriously, i am not an expert, and i admit that i lost 60% of what i put into bitcoin
so, who would listen to me?  who am i trying to influence by saying i lost money, and that i'm not an expert (and that i didn't even own bitcoin until nov 2017)
seriously... you guys are overthinking this way too much.
so let me be crystal clear.
I am relatively new.
i never bought bitcoin until late 2017.
i stopped buying in feb 2018.
i lost 60% of the money that i put into bitcoin.
i am bearish on bitcoin's future prospects.
i think that bitcoin will continue to crash for the rest of 2018.
You can agree or disagree, but that so many get so upset by my simply sharing a totally non-expert opinion just makes those who are upset look like the silly ones, not me.

well, the real issue is that bitcoin is crashing hard
my best guess?
it will be down to $4K by the end of August
and then slowly trickle down to $2K by 2020
after that, who knows?
but bitcoin will be a joke by then, so will it even matter?
@_date: 2018-08-14 19:39:46
dream on?
my investment in bitcoin isn't a dream...
its a nightmare
 
 
 
i mean... what i have, i'll hodl
but my opinion is that bitcoin still has a long way down to still go, we're only halfway through this crash

isn't there a rule that we can't sell stuff on here?
i thought this was just for discussion of bitcoin, opinions on that, and articles/videos on crypto
but hey...
if we can sell stuff on here like a marketplace
i have a bike for sale, here in Los Angeles (east side)
nice road bike, valued at about 1/8th of a bitcoin
but it needs a little work so just send me $200 if you want it, or message me for questions
also...if anyone needs used clothes, or old camera equipment, let me know
lots of other stuff, too
I'll sell it all now that r/btc is a market place!!!!
@_date: 2018-08-14 23:51:44
buying at 6k, while bitcoin is in free fall, is a bad investment
might as wait until it crashes (which will be around 4K and will happen in the next couple of weeks)
buy in a couple of weeks, and pay 4K (which is better than buying now and paying 6K)
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:41:06


you did say "shut up" to me
but its cool
apology accepted
its better when we can all get along and not call names!!!
as for la bron, i don't follow sports much, so all i even know about the guy is that he is a basketball star and that he is considered very dumb by a lot of people
oh yeah.. and that he has a ridiculous beard that looks like a chin strap!

because i was dumb enough to believe people who said "buy the dip" and others who said "hodl, it will come back in a month or two, and go even higher"
by the time i realized bitcoin was dying, i stopped buying, but by then i had already invested a bunch into it
oh well... i was dumb to buy it.  my own fault
i'll never buy bitcoin agains and make that mistake
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:17:47
who said i wasn't *careful*?
i invested carefully, and I only invested what i could afford to lose.
still (whether i can *afford* it or not) to lose 60% of what I put into bitcoin sucks.
An investment that loses 60% of what you put into it in only a few months?
That is called a shitty investment
And an investment where you lose almost everything you put into it, and then you're supposed to just hold on to it for several years, with the hope that years later it will rebound?
Thats not how i like to invest (and to tell the truth, i doubt it will ever rebound i think it hit its all time high in late 2017 and that its only down hill from here on out).
Yes, i'll accept blame and admit its MY own fault.
but i do hate bitcoin, and i'll never buy that shit again.
and yes, i will HODL what i have bought, but i will never purchase/invest in bitcoin again

i don't claim to be credible

i'm not an expert, and me saying that it will be down to $5500 by the week-end is just my opinion.
@_date: 2018-08-11 21:45:58


typo, i meant "is doing very badly"
and as for price, its down every month in 2018
looks like the bubble burst, and that were in a freefall
will be, in my opinion, down to 2k-4k by end of 2018
and then, also my opinion down to 1k-2k by 2020
after that, people will mostly lose interest as it cost more to mine than its worth
and people will move on to less complicated, less volitive crypto assets
@_date: 2018-08-15 02:03:59
and now its gonna be driven even lower

it will be 4K in two weeks

@_date: 2018-08-02 17:03:59
i hope it goes up again
and i am personally going to HODL
i lost 60% of the money i put into btc
and its still crashing down hard
i don't think it will ever go up enough for me to even break even
i should have just burned my money last winter instead of buying bitcoin (at least i would have made a nice warm fire)

i will NEVER buy bitcoin again
bitcoin sucks! i hate it

oh interesting
i am not religious either, but i would never even occur to me to even think that i was somehow better or smarter than someone else just because they believed in God
nor would the thought that someone was "wrong" because they went to church a thought that i would ever have.
i am 100% happy to let anyone else do and think whatever they wish, and as long as they are not harming anyone else, i support their rights to act and think as they wish
most of all, i would never insult or name call anyone else for their own opinions
live and let live, i say

sure, if you like to lose money, thats a good way to do it
as for the foundation of my prediction?
its not a "prediction" its just my opinion.
im not an expert
just my opinion on where it will be soon...
but it seems like its just going down, down, down
its about to be 25% of what it was just a few months ago
thats bad
i think its gonna keep on crashing
and sure, save the post, but when it goes down to 1000-2000 by 2020, you have to admit to me that i was right
i'm sad that bitcoin is dying, i wish it were not, but that is the reality
@_date: 2018-08-30 00:54:07
yeah, because new investors will just be dying to purchase an asset thats lost 70% of its value in the preceding 8 months

it won't go up, and i don't want too profit off the misery of others
@_date: 2018-08-14 22:47:57
i guess we will just have to wait and see
actually, i feel like it will be at 2.5K by the end of 2018
but i felt that was too shocking for people to accept, so i just said it would be at "4K or less"
but no... i can't say for sure, what it will be
...but my most honest guess is that it will be at 2K by early december 2018, and then it will have a little bounce and wind up at 2.5K by the end of december 2018
@_date: 2018-08-06 20:28:10
i shared my opinion on the future of bitcoin
its just an opinion on the future (which can be neither wrong nor right).

@_date: 2018-08-03 21:33:18
thats why i'll hodl
but also not buy anymore

politeness and respect is what we give each other here on r/bitcoin
if you don't want to be polite, i would humbly suggest you do not insult your fellow members of r/bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-30 00:50:31
why would i lie?
lie to say i lost money?
yeah, thats really likely, einstein
i bought nov 17-feb 18
and i'm still hodling what i bought
sadly, what i bought is now worth 60% less
thats why i hate bitcoin
it was my own fault to buy, but i'll never buy any again
buying bitcoin = biggest mistake of my life
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:46:22


i bought spread out from 7k to 19k
from nov '17-feb '18
bought different amounts at different times
average cost of my bitcoins (averaged out) is about 16k
so, at the current price, i lost about 60% of the money that i put into it
luckily i only invested in bitcoin what i could afford to lose
and i am smart enough to know it was a gamble from day one.
and since i diversified, i still did ok, as most of my investments were in vanguard funds and real estate
still, to lose 60% in any one investment in just a few months (as i did with bitcoin) sucks.
Yes, I will hodl what i bought
but i hate bitcoin now, and will never buy any more of it again, ever.
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:30:38
@_date: 2018-08-04 07:37:37

did you sign up with them, give them your assets, without knowing if there was even the option to talk to a real human being?
if so, then its all your own fault
if a company doenst even have a telephone, they you should know they are most likely a scam
@_date: 2018-08-29 16:38:01
i don't participate in buying or selling bitcoin
i bought some, and i hodl what i have and have not sold any yet
i will never buy bitcoin again
i lost 60% of what i put into it
my fault, but i'll never make that mistake again
i will just hodl and hope
but my opinion is that bitcoin will just go down, down, down
wish i had never bought it, but now that i have it, i will just hodl what i have, 
...but will NEVER buy any btc again!
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:28:06
well, it seems like we both agree that btc will lose 20% or more
the only difference is that i think it will lose 20% or more by end of august
and you think it will take until end of september
oh well... either way, things are not looking good for anyone who owns bitcoin in 2018
@_date: 2018-05-12 05:46:30
few weeks?
i bought in november
the first few weeks after i bought it, it went up, but been pretty much a shitshow the entire year of 2018
it seems like the end of 2017 was the end of bitcoin (as a decent investment or something that will go up in value)
i mean, i have been on here and been hearing nothing but "hodl and your bitcoin will go up in value" every day for six months straight
six months later, it hasn't done shit!!!
at some point people need to accept that "hey, it might not go up again"
i hope it does, but six months of shit opens me up to the possibility that it could just be a lost cause and a pipe dream.
of course, if you want to lose money, then yes... bitcoin seems to be the way to go
but it could be worse, i could be macafee who will have to eat his own penis!!!

Hö Lí Fúk!!!
just like i said, bitcoin is crashing, and crashing hard
this sux!
those optimistically claiming a bull market this morning?
i don't think so...
we have a bear and he's destroying all our value
at this rate, we'll be down to $1000 by the end of 2018 (or sooner)
@_date: 2018-08-06 18:12:59
a few days we were well over 7K
yesterday, at 6900
this morning, just about to sink down below 6800
this week alone we are down 15%
and all in all, for all of 2018, we're down about 65%
but hey guys... its all going great!
nothing to worry about here
hodl and buy the dip 
bitcoin has been down before, that means it has to come back this time, right?
right guys???
c'mon... its not dying a slow death, sinking lower and lower each month
that is definitely NOT happening
i'm not in denial, bitcoin is doing just fine, just fine i tell ya.
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:33:03


at this point with bitcoin, its just risk your money to stay about the same (or perhaps even lose it)
better to put your money into real estate or even safer the stock market, where you can make a solid 6% every year, with very minimal risk
@_date: 2018-08-03 21:43:16


i wasn't trying to *debate* anyone, i admit to not being an expert
i was just asking others (those who think it might crash) when they think that the end of bitcoin would be?
if someone does not think that bitcoin with crash and become worth next to nothing? Then thats cool, the question is not for them.
but amongst *those who do think bitcoin with crash and become worth next to nothing*...
i was wondering what *those people* thought, and when exactly did they think bitcoin with crash and become worth next to nothing?
anyway, it was just a question, i did not have any "angle".  I have a small amount of bitcoin (I only bought what i could afford to lose), I don't plan to sell, I'll just HODL, and see what happens (I knew it was a gamble from the start).  I HOPE it goes up in value but i don't believe it will.  Am i trying to affect the market?  LOL  I'm just some random dude who admits to not being an expert of any kind on crypto, so no, I do not think that a post on r/bitcoin is going to affect the worldwide billions of dollars bitcoin market.
it was just curiosity, and wanting to hear other's opinions &amp; thoughts.

@_date: 2018-08-23 05:35:27
i have never been wrong
i am not saying I'm an expert
but none of my predictions or opinions have ever been wrong
i did say that bitcoin will be into the 4000s by the end of August (but August isn't over)
other than that, i said bitcoin would be way down by the end of 2018 and even further down in 2020
but those dates haven't passed yet either
so please... do not lie about me, and say I've been wrong.  I have not.
if you would like to apologize to me for lying, i will consider accepting your apology (if offered).

you don't know that i'm wrong
but my OPINION is that bitcoin is dying
@_date: 2018-08-21 03:42:22
the book i read was "Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond (Unabridged)"
the book was very bullish on btc
these days, i am personally very bearish
i think bitcoin will crash the next two years, at least
and that it will be at $2K in 2020
@_date: 2018-08-04 03:32:57
i agree 100%
i'm not claiming to be an expert, but i also feel that 4K is the next stop
then down to 1K by 2020
Interesting thing is that your opinion that we hit 4K is just an opinion
youre simply expressing your opinion, you are not personally insulting anyone, you are just saying your honest thoughts
and yet...
just because you shared an opinion other than "bitcoin is going to the moon" you will be personally insulted and attacked by many on here (and downvoted, too).
i do not understand why so many on here are so hostile to anyone who has an opinion that is anything other than blind fealty to bitcoin.
its almost like all those who get angry and insult you are being motivated by a fear that you are just too honest to stay silent about.
@_date: 2018-08-15 00:15:53


yes, its called pump and dump
its making a fortune right now (as the rest of us are getting cleaned out)
they'll dump bitcoin once they've milked everything they can from it
thats my opinion anyway...
you *could* be right.  i hope you are
i guess we'll just wait and see!
@_date: 2018-08-16 23:07:21

yeah, right!
btc is down 60% lower in just the last 7 months
and its still (overall) crashing
i am NOT an expert, but my non-expert opinion is that btc will be down to $2000 by the end of 2018
@_date: 2018-08-06 19:32:08

then when the prices skyrocket they dump them.
so, not only are game tickets artificially overpriced, now its just no longer fun to go to games knowing that the whales are ripping us all off with each ticket we buy

thanks for your comment
its a rare refreshing voice of reason on here.
glad not everyone thinks that bitcoin = moon lambos for sure
intellectually, i always knew it was a gamble, but emotionally, i did get caught up in the hype.
oh well,.... live and learn.  
and i agree with everything you say (especially that bitcoin is not the future of money)
but hopefully there will be another wave (although, i doubt that) but since its been a gamble from day one, i might as well wait it out and see.

one of the main rules of r/bitcoin is that we are not allowed to personally insult fellow users, nor are we to insult each other personally

my opinion is that bitcoin is gonna go lower, to 5000 (most likely lower), by september 
my non-expert guess is that sept's average will probably be 4500
not saying anyone should, or should not, believe me
but i do personally see btc going down, down, down
by 2020 it'll be $2000 is my belief

why are we allowing the medical cartel of the universities and the AMA decide the number of doctors?
sadly, the politicians who make these licensing rules have been bought, and are in the pocket of the AMA and big education

@_date: 2018-08-03 21:34:56
oh, ok

as for those who do feel it will crash (like me), what do you all think?
@_date: 2018-08-14 01:53:37
even though i won't call others who also bought bitcoin "assholes" (like you do) I am happy to say that i'll accept blame and admit its MY own fault. 
its 100% my fault for listening to almost the entire bitcoin community last winter when they said buying was a wise choice (i never said i blamed anyone else but myself).
but i do hate bitcoin.
and yes, i will HODL what i have bought, but i'll never buy that shit again.

climate change alarmism been totally debunked (not JUST by oil companies, thats just global warming alarmist propaganda to blame oil companies)
Global warming (as a problem) is a fake theory.
I mean...has the earth ever naturally cooled or warmed?
yes, it always has
but is man causing it?
no evidencie of that.
even if the earth, for whatever reason, got a degree or two warmer, is that bad overall?
nope, if anything it would most likely have a positive effect on food growth (not to mention, there are many more deaths from cold, compared to heat).
but hey... even if global warming was real, and even if we wanted to slow it down, could we affect the earth's weather/climate?
no evidence of humans being able to do that, either.
in other words, will the lefts "solutions" to "global warming" do anything? (other than cost trillions of dollars)?
definitely no evidence of that, at all. none.
now, what if we spent the same money we currently spend trying to "cure" global warming, and instead spent it on real environmental issues like cleaning up water and air pollution (real pollution that is, not just the naturally occurring gas CO2) ...would that be a better use of our limited financial resources?
Yes, of course it would be better to fight real pollution, as opposed to the made up "danger" of CO2 gas.
Global warming (or "global cooling" or "climate change" or whatever else they are calling it this week) is just a ploy by big govt leftists to gain greater power, and to collect even more taxes, and to self-enrich themselves in the process.
The leftists at the top who are pushing global warming alarmism don't really care about the environment, if they did they wouldn't spread this lie, Additionally, , spreading this lie destroys our economy, and removes our freedoms.
Luckily, global warming is considered a joke by anyone with a brain who looks into it.
Your average rank and file low-information voter does honestly think that the fake global warming alarmist theories are true, so they incorrectly think that supporting the global warming manipulators like al gore is the right thing to do.
we (who are truly educated on the reality of the global warming hoax) now know the truth, its just a matter of educating the rest of the public to the truth about al gore and the rest of his lying leftist ilk.
p.s if you want to educate yourself on this subject, a great resource to check out is 
another good one is 
but do YOUR OWN research, look at ALL the sources, and you'll soon discover the truth on your own
@_date: 2018-08-06 21:03:52


no, i am NOT mocking recent participants

it does go on with fiat

it does seem like its just the pump and dump whales, the tech billionaires and the insider-trading exchanges that are controlling everything to their favor

@_date: 2018-08-18 23:06:44
YES! I am saying that.
Over the last month BTC lost 20% in value.
the next two weeks, i think it will go down 30% more from where it is now.
I am not saying i KNOW i'm right.
but yes... my OPINION is that bitcoin will lose about $2000 (or more) in the next two weeks.
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:27:39
don't forget, the coinbase employees had inside info
and also manipulated the coinbase site so it wouldn't let those who bought sell it at the peak (until after the coinbase insiders had sold their own first)
coinbase is one of the most corrupt exchanges out there
oh... and coinbase did an internal investigation, and they found that "there was no evidence of insider trading"

@_date: 2018-08-04 06:43:23

oh i used to smoke weed, smoked my way through high school
and hey... i am a libertarian, do whatever you want, smoke weed, smoke crack, shoot heroin, play video games 10 hours a day and go to hookers at night, its your own life
i am just saying (for me) that to smoke weed and go through life high is NOT my choice
besides, in regard to those who smoke weeds, the smell of smoke is gross
and hey... we ALL know that people that love weed (99.99% of the time) are not talking about the medical uses, they just love to feel and be high
so anyway... do as you wish, personally I just love my life, and love to be sober and aware as I go through it
as i mentioned, this is just my own opinion, and being sober is what makes me happiest.  life is hard, and if someone feels that using drugs makes their life better, then who am i to tell them not to do them?
do whatever you need to to make your own life as awesome as it can be.  and no one but you should make that choice for your own life.

in my mind, that money is already gone,

@_date: 2018-08-30 01:58:27
call it what you want
i just simply type out the opinion that i think bitcoin will continue to go down on value
thats my opinion
you can call it a whine or not
i don't care
i'm just bearish on bitcoin
deal with it
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:55:17
youre happy to buy at 6K 
even though bitcoin is crashing, and will be down to 4K by the end of August?
you should seriously rethink that
@_date: 2018-08-30 02:38:08
well, i like my real estate and stock holding, but would like to own even more
as for my bitcoin holdings, i hate them. and i will hodl
but they lost 60% this year, so i hate them
so i am not satisfied, so i must be doing it right!

they'll all be buying it because it will be for sale at the .99cent store
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:41:45


yes, once it hits $4000K
it'll crash hard after that, and no one will want to mine
it will be big mess, and possible collapse
@_date: 2018-05-12 07:22:56
i'm not crying. just pointing out that bitcoin is shit in 2018
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:27:07


but i think its gonna keep going down
it will be at 4k in two weeks
and then down to 2k or less by 2020
so, no sense in anyone buying now while its 6K
thats just my opinion
also, i am done with bitcoin
its a shit investment
i'll stick with winners like the stock market and real estate
and other than hodling what i currently own, i am not going to have anything more to do with this turkey called bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-29 21:38:27
i bought starting last nov, through feb 2018
and i put what i bought onto a ledger
so, i have not sold any of it, and i just hodl what I have bought
sadly, the value of the bitcoin i bought has gone down 60%
and it gets worse with each passing month.
so, i will continue to hodl (for now).
but my non-expert opinion is that bitcoin will go down even more, although its kinda strange, anytime i share that opinion on here, i get attacked just for having a bearish opinion on bitcoin
i guess only *certain* opinions are allowed?
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:42:32
seriously, wtf?
why do some people think that having a bearish outlook on bitcoin is "trolling"?
is just an opinion
being bearish is no more troll-like than being bullish on bitcoin
seriously, please stop acting like any opinion that isn't saying bitcoin is going "to the moon" is trolling
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:54:02
our 6K support **MAY** fail?
it already failed yesterday, when it was down to 5900
and (in my opinion) BTC will be down to $4K in two weeks, by the end of August
@_date: 2018-08-30 02:02:47
 i only invested in bitcoin what i could afford to lose
and i am smart enough to know it was a gamble from day one.
and since i diversified, i still did ok, as most of my investments were in vanguard funds and real estate
still, to lose 60% in any one investment in just a few months (as i did with bitcoin) sucks.
Yes, I will hodl what i bought
but i hate bitcoin now, and will never buy any more of it again, ever.

only people who do not follow the rules of r/bitcoin have called me a troll
you clearly do not follow the rules of r/bitcoin
all i can say is that you *should* follow the rules of this subreddit
but calling me names as you do, is rule-breaking
i mean seriously.... why be a part of this subreddit when you come here to break the rules?
my suggestion to you: follow the rules!
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:21:59
yes, its is creepy that others have started saying things on here that are similar to what the german people said to Jewish people in the 1930s
i am NOT saying that what intolerant people are doing on here is the exact same as what the germans did (but you know that!) I am simply saying its the same sort of intolerant attitude.
even if the result is not as bad, its still not cool to be intolerant!
users on here claiming that certain people's opinions are worth less than others dis make me think of that bad time in world history
let us value EVERYONE'S opinions, and stop saying things like some peoples opinions are not as valuable as others
its not just ONE opinion that is allowed
here on r/bitcoin both bear and bull opinion are allowed
lets not attack fellow users of this subreddit for their beliefs
instead, lets all just try to get along and love one another
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:31:04
first of all, you are so negative in your tone and attitude
always with the impolite comments directed at fellow users.
i never personally insult or engage in name calling with fellow users of this subreddit (maybe you can learn from me?)
how about you limit your vitriol to the actual facts of the news, and enough with the personal jibes?
but hey... if you enjoy truth, then yes... by all means, enjoy all my comments!
peace and love to all ...including you!
@_date: 2018-08-14 01:29:22
and down another couple hundred or more today
every month, bitcoin is worth less and less
2018 might be the year that bitcoin dies
either way, 2018 is a terrible time for bitcoin, greatest loss of bitcoin value (in actual dollars) ever!
i used to like bitcoin, then i was like "meh"
but now... i fucking HATE bitcoin
 
@_date: 2018-08-10 20:32:34
i'll adjust my comment
no one, generally speaking, wants bitcoin
as it is, in the larger sense, becoming less profitable with each month that passes
@_date: 2018-08-08 02:09:43
yes, you will be the king of bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-08-10 20:30:40
yes, i think youre right
there will be some ups and downs, and some dead cat bounces, 
so i don't think we will go straight down, we'll just slowly seep downwards, less and less in value (overall) with each month that passes
@_date: 2018-08-18 17:59:26


its like some people get upset at anyone who is bearish on bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-13 02:43:55
whats awkward about not wanting another dude to "hold my bags"?
theres nothing awkward about being the kind of real man that i am, the kind who does not want another man to *hold my bags*!
like i said, i like "tacos" (wink, wink, nudge nudge)
know what i mean?
just relax there, buddy
you don't have to be all PC
just be a man, and reject other dudes who want to hold your bags (not that there is anything wrong with it, lol)
and go for it, and who knows? but maybe you'll have a *taco* that will let you play with her before too long.
best wishes and good luck!
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:23:55
no, i am done with further investing in bitcoin in any form
i'll just hold what i have
even though i think that bitcoin is in a slow death spiral
and nope... i'm not a billionaire on a yacht 
but i am still financially savvy enough to now realize that bitcoin is shit

nothing wrong with people who are Chinese

I was saying that the *govt of China* is an evil communist dictatorship that kills people, steals technology, and opposes freedom
anyway... i hope that clears things up, and if i wasn't clear in my meaning, then I apologize.

once again, another comment that has nothing to do with bitcoin
just a personal insult directed at me.
seriously, people, stay on topic.
here, let me start off and show you.
this is the bitcoin subreddit, so let me say, i think bitcoin will go down in value the rest of the year
I'm no expert, thats just my opinion on what bitcoin will do.
my opinion is also that it will go down to $4000 by the end of 2018
i hope it goes up, but i FEEL it will go down.
if you have an opinion on bitcoin, or any bitcoin related thoughts, feel free to share.
and if you have any personal insults, then please do not share those.
hope that helps! thanks!
@_date: 2018-08-21 05:05:31
so true!
@_date: 2018-08-18 17:57:43
oh, i never said my opinion was worth anything
and i admit that i am not an expert
in fact, i lost 60% of the money i invested in bitcoin
i never said that someone should do as i do
i just shared what i felt, and my opinion
i think that i'm correct, but thats just my opinion
i am welcome to my opinion, just as youre welcome to yours
but in MY opinion, i think its going to be in the 4000s by the end of august
@_date: 2018-08-30 05:58:33
i never said i was expert
i am open to learning
i even read a HUGE book on it called "Cryptoassets: The Innovative Investor's Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond (Unabridged)"
i also used to listen to the "experts" on here that "knew more than me" 
but by doing that, i lost 60% of the money i put into it.
the "geniuses" and "experts" on here in late 2017-early 2018 ALL said bitcoin was going to 40K or more
in reality it went to 7K and is still going down
so, i'm open to learning, but i'll never buy bitcoin again, ever!
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:37:18
you jelly?
its cool
we all fam here on r/bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:16:29
yes, i admit i bought when the price was higher, and that i lost 60% of the value since then
i was foolish to buy bitcoin, but i learned my lesson, and will never buy again.
will it ever get to 19K again? in my non-expert opinion, i don't think so
i think it will go down, down, down even more
but hey... i HOPE youre right
@_date: 2018-05-12 19:55:28

@_date: 2018-08-15 17:27:41
i didn't listen to my intuition when i first bought bitcoin
although, at that time, it was saying "this is too good to be true"
but i was a fool and listened to almost everyone on here who said it was going up, up, up
and that it would hit 40K before leveling off
what a joke
but it was my fault to listen to those who were saying that bitcoin was "going to the moon"
that never happened, as we all know bitcoin didn't go to the moon, it went to the poon!
but seriously, i take ALL the blame for buying bitcoin
stupidest thing i ever did.
and worst investment i ever made in my life.
i've learned my lesson, though.
i'll stick with real money makers like the stock market and real estate.
nothings a guarantee, of course...
but i've made, on average, about a positive 8% return on stocks and real estate.
as for bitcoin, not so great.  i am at negative 60% with the money i invested in bitcoin.
so yes, i will HODL the bitcoin that i now have, but i will never buy any of that shit again.  no more btc for me!
@_date: 2018-08-15 19:01:26
no, i am making my predictions based on all of 2018 (and late 2017, too)
in all of 2018 bitcoin has lost about 70% of its value in just a few months
thats very bad for any investment 
and, in my opinion, its gonna keep crashing until it hits $2K (which will be sometime in 2020)
you can agree or not, i'm just a regular guy sharing my opinon
not sure why me, a regular guy, sharing my non-expert opinion, makes so many people on here so mad?

sex workers are human
and i feel sorry for them, but no one would want their daughter to be a whore/sex worker, because we all know its a career filled with sadness and disease, and emotional problems.
so, i don't think they are sub-human, just women who have made the worst of all possible choices (usually based on desperation, self-loathing, poor self-esteem, or because they are being manipulated by a pimp or other abusive man in their lives.
but when it comes to even thinking of having sex with a whore, science is science
and if a woman sleeps with thousands of men, or even hundreds of men, many of whom are strangers and/or sex addicts, too
then, she will be very likely to be diseased (certainly at much higher rates that a regular woman who doesn't have sex with thousands of strange men)
not to mention, sex workers are MUCH more likely to be drug addicts,
and drug addicts are full of diseases too.
besides, whether a woman is a whore or not... for me to meet a woman, and then almost immediately have sex, is both gross and unsafe to me
so hey... sleep with whores if YOU want to
as for me, no way
its too gross/risky for my tastes
@_date: 2018-08-20 23:51:29
well, bitcoin is definitely about getting my money out of somewhere
just this year, 60% of the money that i put into bitcoin has vanished
its totally gone
now if i only knew where it all went, or how to get it back?
thanks bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-08-29 16:42:23
well, just because other predictions of all sorts about bitcoin have been wrong in the past, that doesnt mean that this one about bitcoin dying is wrong now
you do know how logic works?
you can disagree with my bearish thoughts on bitcoin, or not, but if you disagree with me, do so with ideas (not with logical fallacies)

**i am NOT saying YOU personally are a super creepy person** (i don't know that you are, but even IF I knew you were, I would never call you "creepy" on here, as I don't personally insult fellow members of r/bitcoin)
but maybe, in the future, use less creepy ways of describing losing money on bitcoin?
if you'll excuse me, i have to go and get those creepy thoughts out of my head (so i am unable to reply to your post at the moment)
and one final thing, i would politely request that you don't use vulgar or creepy terms when writing to me in the future.
I know i can't make you not use creepy terms, but i did want to politely make that request of you.
good bye and good night for now, have to run.

oh, well... who said i am a no coiner?
I have a small amount of bitcoin (I only bought what i could afford to lose), I don't plan to sell, I'll just HODL, and see what happens (I knew it was a gamble from the start). I HOPE it goes up in value but i don't believe it will.
as for you saying:


ok, thats a good point, do you know WHY bitcoin will crash, or go to near-nothing in the years ahead?
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:48:26
yes, i did
and thats my point
i did not engage in a personal attack against you (unless you are secretly a ww2 era german?)
i used an analogy to make a point, with no personal attacks on you or anyone elseon here, either.
its strange, but i do not think you understand what an ad hominem attack is
perhaps you could look it up on wikipedia?
either way, i am happy to clarify if need be
and whatever the case, peace and love to you!
@_date: 2018-08-14 03:45:39
i don't need to talk, i am a man who expresses myself primary through action
i took the action of actually spending my own money to buy bitcoin
thats the most bullish thing you can do.
sadly, bitcoin crashed, and i lost 60% of my money that i spent on it
thats my fault
but i still hate bitcoin
it sucks
and its the worst investment i ever spent money on in my whole life
@_date: 2018-08-04 06:36:10
yes, like many others
i invested in bitcoin and was affected when bitcoin crashed
of course, most normal people who invest in an asset and then see that asset lose 70% of its value, are going to be like "oh hmmm, i think there is a problem here"
in fact anyone who knows anything about investing would be troubled by an asset that went down in value 70% in just a few months, especially if that asset was STILL going down (as bitcoin is).
you can just act all oblivious, or be cool with btc losing 70% of its value, and continuing to crash.
thats cool, its a free world, think what you want, have any opinion you wish.
but that so many on here attack me (and any one else who isn't looking at bitcoin through rose colored glasses) just shows that you can't follow the rules of this subreddit (to not engage in name calling or personal insults) and it also shows that you are obviously bothered on a deeper level, and threatened by anyone who says what you are clearly afraid of (that bitcoin could possible go down to near-nothing).
oh well...
no worries, i forgive you,  but you might want to look into why certain opinions like mine bother you so.
@_date: 2018-08-29 17:16:10
hurt my feelings?
its not personal
its purely data driven
i bought an asset, and that asset lost 60% of its value in 8 months
so, i hate bitcoin because its a money loser (ever since 2018 started)
in the past, it made money, now its just the same as sticking your cash in the toilet and flushing

but yes... they (the govt and the big tech companies) have all my info by now, i am sure.
so, its probably too late, but i'll check out r/privacy, and maybe learn a few things, i hope?
@_date: 2018-05-12 09:52:46
haha what a retard you are
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:47:19
no, but going from 20K to 7K in a few months IS crashing
you see, now?
@_date: 2018-08-15 02:04:56
i won't get rekt
i just stopped buying months again, and will never buy again
i am holding, and have never sold
i hope BTC goes up, but i think its gonna crash long and hard for some time before it does (if it ever does go up again at all)
@_date: 2018-08-21 02:58:33


thanks, nice of you to say
and hey, i don know about the ins and outs of "the market"
i do know what its like to have more money, and to have less money
and i prefer to have more money then to put it into something like bitcoin and then have it lose 60% of its total value in a few months
and its STILL going down
i don't even like to look lately, each time i do its crashed more.
for 7 months people on here have been saying any day it will go to the moon
and each new day brings yet another downward dip in bitcoins price
and even a slight rise, and people are popping champagne corks
only to see it crash even lower the net day
i don't know much about bitcoin, but i know one thing
the overwhelming opinion on here that bitcoin is coming back, baby...
any day now.
have been consistently wrong for month after month after month
and all the so-called experts who predicted that this crash would be over months ago, are 100 percent wrong
a few people who said its gonna crash for at least two more years, those are the only ones i believe anymore
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:46:16


do i have to psychoanalyze every time i post?
although... i feel that bitcoin is crashing, and its pretty obvious
i'm just curious why so many seem in denial about this?
as for me personally, no help needed or requested
i live in happiness and bliss
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:23:35


yes, i know that.  I invested carefully.
I only invested what i could afford to lose.
still (whether i can afford it or not) to lose 60% of what I put into bitcoin sucks.
An investment that loses 60% of what you put into it in only a few months?
That is called a shitty investment.
Thats not how i like to invest (and to tell the truth, i doubt it will ever rebound i think it hit its all time high in late 2017 and that its only down hill from here on out).
Yes, i'll accept blame and admit its MY own fault. its 100% my fault for listening to almost the entire bitcoin community last winter when they said buying was a wise choice (i never said i blamed anyone else but myself).
but i do hate bitcoin.
and yes, i will HODL what i have bought, but i'll never buy that shit again.
 
@_date: 2018-08-04 06:26:58


i am saying, that bitcoin lost 70% of its value in just a few months
and its still going down, down, down
ANY asset or investment that loses 70% of its value in just a few months, and is still going down, is an asset that is in trouble
will btc be able to recover?
i have no idea
my guess is no
but hey... i *hope* it can recover
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:05:11
yes, i do see "how it works", except that...
talking about your opinion on bitcoin is fine and its the whole point of this subreddit
on the other hand, personally insulting a fellow user of this subreddit is against the rules of r/bitcoin
please limit your opinions to bitcoin and things that are bitcoin related
but calling another user a name like "troll" is against the rules, and might even get you banned

yes, the sky is falling is my opinion, and that opinion falls under the category of bearish

well, when there is limited education slots, and more applicants than available schools, then obviously prices will soar
with anyone who qualifies being allowed to practice medicine (such as with law school or really... any other profession) then more schools would teach it, and more doctors could be out there practicing medicine
more options is better for consumers
sadly, politicians serve their special interests, not the people.

well, if the person saying it had an Audi, too
and if all the Audis sold in 2018 had lost 70% of their value in just 7 months 
then yes... I'd be surprised
In fact, if every Audi had lost 70% of its value in 7 months, then Id think that most Audi owners would be upset, and not just say "Oh, I better buy a bunch more Audis while the price is low"
I think Audi owners would rather say "lets look and see why our Audis have lost so much value, and then lets fix that, or if we can't fix it, lets just sell our Audis, and buy a Mercedes because their value is stable".
@_date: 2018-08-11 11:41:58
i didn't say i was selling, or buying
i'm just saying bitcoin misdoing VERY badly.

what a retard!
but it is funny, the way hes talking about the stock market in this movie is how certain people feel about bitcoin now

i'm not an expert, never claimed to be
i'm just a regular guy with an opinion
and my opinion, based on nothing other than what i think, is that bitcoin will go waaaaay down
i could be wrong? i am just sharing what i think
i hope that your right, and i even hope that it goes to 1 million or more like macafee claims it will
he knows more than i do about crypto assets
its just, even if i don't technically know as much as the "experts" i feel bitcoin will crash hard and long, and will be way down (especially these next 2 years)
@_date: 2018-08-10 04:50:18

bitcoin dropped OVER $12,000 dollars in 2018
thats more than one penny
@_date: 2018-08-13 16:15:22
yes in the past, there were large rises (that offset losses)
these days, its quite possible that bitcoin has peaked, and that its all down hill from here
after all, we all know that past gains are not a guarantee of future gains
speaking only for myself, bitcoin has sucked big time, and has done nothing but lose most of the money that i put into it
i listened to the people on here (which was almost everyone) who said it was a wise choice to buy bitcoin
and in listening to most of the people on here, i lost most of the money that i put into bitcoin.
now the people on here say "oh we were wrong to say you should have bought bitcoin in late 2017, but we're correct now when we say buy it now"
fool me once, shame on me....
but buy MORE bitcoin?  LOL never.  fuck bitcoin!
basically, the two things i know are that i lost money in bitcoin, and that the people who said to buy it were wrong
so yes... i'll hodl the bitcoin i currently have, but bitcoin sucks and i hate bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-08-06 21:25:41

yes, i noticed that
if anyone says anything, even slightly negative about btc, then there are a bunch of guys who attack them, just for sharing an opinion
its like, to them, only one opinion is allowed, and that opinion is that bitcoin is going to the moon
if you express any other opinion then you get called a troll or get accused of spreading FUD
i hope it never crashes to zero, but i personally belief (in my non-expert opinion) that it will go down to 1 or 2K by the end of 2020
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:38:39


i won't do that
when it comes to making money I'm gonna focus on what i know best (stocks and real estate)
i'll still hODL on to the btc i have (just in case)
but i am done with any further investing in the bitcoin markets ever again
although, i think bitcoin will be crashed out within a few years, so I won't even have to think about it again, after 2020 or so (is my opinion)
@_date: 2018-08-06 18:22:04
there's gonna be a lot of rich bullshitters eating their weiners when bitcoin crashes

maybe, i can't say i agree with you about that.
i'm no expert, but in my non-expert OPINION, i *think* that bitcoin will be down in the 4000s by the end of August

i never said someone couldn't be functional and smoke weed
although i do do know (in MY case) that when i dont smoke weed or use drugs i am much more successful and get more done, and can follow my dreams with more passion and drive.
i am just saying (for me) that life is great, and getting better
and to be in a drugged state is not the thing (for me)
i'd rather just enjoy my life and this awesome time we are in, without the need to chemically alter my mood
i feel good (most of the time) feel bad (some times) but whatever life throws at me, i love to be present, feel it and live it fully, and i never think "oh let me unjust a bunch of chemicals to change my mind"
thats just me, i prefer to be not under the influence, but whatever anyone else needs/wants to do is up to them.

well, Trump is in office, most likely, for more than 6 years
so, the US economy should be strong, stock market included, for some time
but sooner or later, it will be someone else, and when that happens the US economy could have a downturn
when that happens, hard to say
btc might go up, or down, but i doubt it will stay the same.
(although, MOST likely, if the US economy tanks bitcoin will go WAY DOWN as well).
@_date: 2018-08-05 18:47:43
sure, i support my fellow bitcoiners 100%
and i love the memes, too
i'm just sad that btc is dying a slow death (at least thats the case in 2018)
@_date: 2018-08-15 18:46:52
started buying in nov 2017
kept buying until february 2018 (or so)
it was going down, down, down in price, and i fell for the "buy the dip" talk in the first few months of 2018
eventually i learned that its kept crashing more and more each month, and it will (in my opinion) just keep on crashing hard for the next couple of years (at the least)
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:22:51
agree 100%

look, the real issue isn't the exact amount that the dead cat bounce lasts
its that bitcoin is crashing, and crashing hard
it will be heading downward for some time
and heading down lower and lower each month
the rest of 2018 will be even worse than it is now
will it be down in 48 hours?
most likely
will it be down close  to 4K within 2 weeks?
definitely, for sure, for sure.
@_date: 2018-08-13 16:35:21
if you want to buy lower price bitcoins just wait
the price goes down every month
the longer you wait, the cheaper it will be
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:53:50
then back down to 2K

it seems like EVERY single person who's gotten into bitcoin in the last 8 or 9 months (which is a lot of people) are very optimistic and bullish on bitcoin
and yet, EVERY single person who's gotten into bitcoin in the last 8 or 9 months is just losing a ton of money.
and anyone who dares to say anything bearish about bitcoin its attacked for being a troll (just for sharing any opinion that differs from the "we're going to the moon" groupthink)
and of course, any new post that is bearish gets down voted to oblivion, and never seen again.
why do you all think only one opinion is essentially allowed on here?
and any debate is banished (if one of the parties os bearish on bitcoin)
I wish all opinions were discussed freely.
but if someone so much as says that they think bitcoin is going down this year (as i often say) and they get attacked and insulted non-stop.
It seems like only allowing those who think that bitcoin will go to the moon any day now to be the singular voice heard is a guaranteed path to eventual financial ruin.
I mean, bitcoin is doing VERY badly this year, and yet most on here can not even be honest about that.
and no... an asset that loses 70% of its value in a few months is NOT a good thing.
I'm not saying that bitcoin can never come back, but we should be honest enough to admit that its doing really poorly right now, and there is no sign of it improving anytime soon.
@_date: 2018-08-30 04:29:23
yes, 
IF it did
but thats the thing, i don't think it will ever even go back to 20K ever, let alone 50K
but yeah, if it went to one million, like john macafee says, i'd love it even more
but i think it won't, and i think it will just crash ever more this next few years
thats why i hate it
@_date: 2018-05-12 09:53:21

i didn't buy stocks in 2002
as for real estate in 2007-09, where i live (los angeles) real estate only dropped about 15-20% in the decent parts of town (where i reside and bought property)
and it bounced back within a couple of years.  
it was only suckers that had zero interest, no proof of income required loans, or ballon mortgages that got screwed, anyway.  That was their own fault for being stupid, and taking out loans they could not afford.
but even if you were in a place in the USA that had a 33% temporary real estate price drop, thats nothing compared to bitcoin losing 70% of its value in 2018
so buy all the bitcoin you want, if you think its such a great deal (I'm not stopping you)
I'm just saying, personally, i will never buy bitcoin again
worst investment i ever made was to buy bitcoin.  i hate it.
but my fellow r/bitcoin members?  i love you all.

immigrants are great, i should know, i am one.
America loves immigrants (as long as they are not criminals who are here illegally).
we love our legal immigrants, and they are not to blame.
but illegal immigrants?  they are criminals and they cause A LOT of problems.
illegal immigrants need to leave, and if they want to come back, thats fine... if they do it the legal way.
so stop acting like immigrant and "illegal immigrant" are the same thing.
i am not saying illegal immigrants are the ONLY problem in America, but they are a big one, and one we could mostly solve, if we would just deport the criminal illegal aliens, end sanctuary cities, and build the wall.
its all simple to do, we just need to get rid of the democrat party politicians by voting them out!

yes and $20k minus $14k = a huge loss

its going down below that now, and starting to crash hard again
so... thats a good thing, i guess
hey, don't feel bad, i lost a ton of money in bitcoin, so welcome to the club
my best guess, btc will be down in the 4000s by end of august
@_date: 2018-08-30 00:57:15
@_date: 2018-08-29 03:52:27
yes, even with this latest bounce, we're still down 15% compared to last month
and we're still down about 60% overall, for all of 2018
each month, generally speaking, is worse than the previous month.
so yes, we had a little uptick... but all in all, the pattern for this entire year is severely downward.
so, i think it'll keep going down the rest of 2018, until it hits 4000 (perhaps even lower)
@_date: 2018-05-12 06:49:54
hanging on, but just slowly losing value each year

5000 by the end of 2018

Irans economic mess has nothing to do with the fact that they use a fiat currency
this is happening because they fucked with Trump, and now he's making them pay.

lots of people, and i mean A LOT of people bet the wrong way
LOTS of us lost money
and if i can be helpful to them, than thats my mission
i care more about those who lost money than i care about some early adopters who are now millionaires 
i care for the little guy or gal who's been hurt by investing in bitcoin
and i want to be a helpful warning beacon to anyone else who's thinking of investing in the chaotic and corrupt bitcoin investing world.
its full of billionaire pump and dumpers, tech billionaire manipulators, and dishonest insider-trading exchanges,
and the odds are stacked against a regular honest investor.
if someone wants to foolishly invest (as i did) then go for it, but i will do all i can to warm others of how risky and corrupt the whole process is.
I will not just mindlessly parrot those who say "Lambo" and "to the moon".
I will be an honest voice in the wilderness, preaching the truth about the dangers of bitcoin to all who want to hear my message.
and if some on here don't like me speaking the truth (as opposed to just saying "oh its guaranteed to come back up") then thats their problem.
but i will never be bullied into silence about the dangers of bitcoin, or how it is crashing down,and crashing down HARD.

seems weird.
but just so you know, i have ONLY bought
i have lost 60% of the value of what i bought
but i'm hodling everything i ever bought, and will just hodl on for now
i have never sold or even used bitcoin, ever.
i just bought it, and then i put it on a ledger, and now i just watch its value go down practically every time i check
yes, i do hate bitcoin, but i do also own it, and i am hodling what i own

they'll just have all your assets, and all your personal info, and if they go belly up, or just decide to take off, they will just sell your info, and you can't even call them, or even know where they are.
avoid this company, and all others that don't have telephone tech support
@_date: 2018-08-18 20:45:13
so true
if someone says that they think bitcoin will continue going down the rest of 2018, which is what i say and believe, and they will get attacked (as i do every time i say that).
its like the only allowed opinion is that youre bullish on bitcoin
but have a bearish opinion of bitcoin, you'll be strongly critiqued on here.
oh well...
at least i know "the rules" and the main rule is to only speak of bitcoin in positive terms.  no.matter.what.
@_date: 2018-08-15 00:22:02
no one cares?
thats why there are over 70 people commenting on my one post?
and hundreds of replies
seems like someone cares
and the person who has replied to me the most?
its you!
you care and write to me more than ANY other person
i really am living rent-free in your head
thanks, i'm flattered that you are my number one follower and replier
good for you
now if you can just learn to be fun and happy like me, you'll have it made
@_date: 2018-08-21 03:17:52


i already said "that was my mistake, and i accept 100% of the blame for my stupidity"
as for bitcoin:
bitcoin is shit
its a stupid investment vehicle for day traders, but it has no real value other than as a gamble.
and its the worst gamble ever, as the regular guy gets screwed every time by pump and dump whales and tech billionaires, and corrupt insider trading exchanges.
its a total suckers bet for they average man.
i learned my lesson, i'll never be suckered by bitcoin investing again
and day to day use?
naw, no one wants to use this overly-complicated, slow, yo-yoing asset as currency
@_date: 2018-08-15 01:00:39
not me
@_date: 2018-05-12 09:51:52
you are a retard, huh?
@_date: 2018-08-06 21:34:39
no u
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:44:34
i didn't say you *should* believe me
i'm just posting my opinion
that bitcoin is crashing
its lost 65% of its value in 2018
and over 10 % of its value just this week
my opinion is that its a dying asset and will be down to near-nothing by 2020
@_date: 2018-08-29 23:27:35
but as an invstment, its lost most of its value this year
so it sucks!
i hate bitcoin
worst thing i EVER bought
@_date: 2018-08-29 22:27:36


yes, i only bought what i could afford to lose
and i knew, from day one, that it was a gamble
now its even more of an extreme long shot, but as long as i'm in... i'll just stay in, and see what happens
if you ask me what i think will happen, i'd say "i bet it winds up going down even more"
that it will lose value is my OPINION.
but i admit to not being an expert, so i am rolling the dice some more, and hoping (against all reason) that bitcoin bounces back.
either way, i'll hodl for now, and just keep watching.
but buy more bitcoin? naw, i will never do that, i do think that bitcoin, by far, was the worst investment i ever bought into.
@_date: 2018-05-12 09:51:31
i'll just hodl
at this point who cares?
its not too much, and i'm well off in my regular stocks and real estate
but its a long shot
i'm betting it will go way down
@_date: 2018-08-15 21:52:10
so true
my fiat is doing fine
my bitcoin? minus 60%
@_date: 2018-08-30 05:17:18
well, there you go
you don't care if it goes up in value
i do care, a lot
i want it to go up in value compared to fiat
i liked it when it went up
and i hate it now that it lost most of its value this year
if you don't care about fiat
then hey!  give me all your fiat (you don't even like it, right?)
and it its enough, i'll give you all my bitcoin (i'm only charging $20K per bitcoin, thats a lot of fiat for one bitcoin, but since you don't care about fiat, you won't mind, i am sure)
all joking aside, I'm done with stupid bitcoin, though.
i'm just gonna hodl (but will never buy it again)
and i am glad i didn't put too much into it.
thank God i had some good investments (NOT bitcoin) to put the rest of my money into!
@_date: 2018-08-21 07:03:57


yes, i admit that
but at least i didn't follow a really dumb blonde chicks opinions and repost her too like a fan boy
she's dumb, but you know what else... she'll still never date a guy like you (sorry)
but hey, lets just be nice to each other, no need for you to insult they way you do

posting this picture as a joke is funny
but in reality, btc is down 15% just this week
and down about 65% for all of 2018
oh... and its STILL crashing
bitcoin isn't going to the moon, its going into the toilet
@_date: 2018-08-13 16:20:49
buy MORE bitcoin? LOL **never**. fuck bitcoin!
basically, the two things i know are that i lost money in bitcoin, and that the people who said to buy it were wrong
so yes... i'll hodl the bitcoin i currently have, but bitcoin sucks and i hate bitcoin!
 
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:36:43
the link i posted isn't opinions
its fact based
sounds like you are saying you won't accept facts that clash with your existing opinions
@_date: 2018-08-21 03:29:48
because, i actually like some of the people on here, and i also curious to see how bitcoin is doing, and what others think and say
i think its gonna crash, and i hate that i invested my own actual money in it
but i still want it to go up, even though i feel it will just crash more
@_date: 2018-08-30 05:08:00


right now bitcoin is down over 60% from its high
thats today, right this second
and right now, the price of bitcoin sucks!
@_date: 2018-08-21 06:49:14
you follow what a really really dumb blonde tells you?
easily manipulated boy,
perhaps think things through?
and perhaps don't insult your fellow members of r/bitcoin?
be normal, not rude
@_date: 2018-08-14 03:26:47
hey, you asked a question...
i answered it
fucking bitcoin sucks
thats my opinion
like it or not!
@_date: 2018-08-10 05:02:14
but no one wants bitcoin anymore
people just waiting to sell off
@_date: 2018-08-21 17:23:29
you should read what u/manchasingpaper said:


guys, no shit you don’t wanna believe it crashing. your mind will not accept that, and will naturally get annoyed with me saying that as you have invested your money into what i’m saying is not worth investing in.
so i totally understand why no one likes talking about how the value is definitely going down over time and becoming more and more unstable. but it’s true
instead of downvoting and spam commenting “it’ll bounce back” with ZERO supporting argument of why it’s somehow showing long term growth and increasing value potential , can you actually say WHY it somehow is more likely to get stronger based on the data it’s been showing ever since it crashed?
@_date: 2018-08-06 19:30:17
yes, lets make fun of those who have bought recently
thats a great strategy for bitcoin and the bitcoin community.
the early adopters who made their money (like you) now insult and make fun of new arrivals and those who have taken a financial hit.
yeah, great plan!
let me know how that works out for you?
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:25:18
either way, its bad new for anyone who is HODLing now
@_date: 2018-08-15 17:21:21
yes, its a series of peaks and valleys
the ultimate goal will be that it hits 4k by the end of august

@_date: 2018-08-17 05:04:45
exchanges like coinbase would rather use insider trading and manipulation to rob you, as opposed to outright theft
besides, with outright theft, they can only rob their users one time, with insider trading and price manipulation, coinbase can rob its users over and over and over, again.
@_date: 2018-08-06 21:02:31


well , i am patient, 
i have only bought,
and have HODl 100%
and yet, every time i look, i have less value
all the experts said buy, buy, buy last winter, and i listened
i guess i was an idiot to do so
@_date: 2018-08-02 04:30:37
sorry jeff
i'm not selling my 1/8th of a bit coin
i'm gonna HODL
you'll never get it all
@_date: 2018-08-14 23:52:06
you too!
@_date: 2018-08-30 02:36:57
i am not denying there was a time when someone could get into bitcoin and make a lot of money
i am simply saying, in my opinion, that those days have long since gone past
@_date: 2018-08-13 19:37:57
well, its too late, i already bought some bitcoin (last winter).
so, i'll hodl on to that (might as well ride it out, at this point)
I think bitcoin is just slowly dying from this point onward (so i won't buy any more)
but hey... you never know, i hope it comes back (although in my non-expert opinion, i don't think it will)
so i do control my destiny.  i will hodl bitcoin, as its a total gamble (even though bitcoin, thus far, have only been a negative 60% on what i put into it)
but when it comes to my primary investments, i'll still to what has always worked for me (real estate which gets me about 10% positive return) and the stock market (which gets me about a 6% return) 
 
@_date: 2018-08-06 20:45:35
@_date: 2018-08-21 17:23:43
yup, i do
@_date: 2018-08-14 23:46:24
i'm smart enough to know that the entire bitcoin system is rigged to favor pump and dump whales, billionaire tech investors, and corrupt exchanges that engage in insider trading
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:49:24
oh, i am not sure if its easy or not (to predict that bitcoin will be down a lot in the days ahead).
i think bitcoin is in a potential death spiral (on the other hand, there are some foolishly think that btc will go to the moon any day now).
personally, i am just saying, that i predict that bitcoin will continue to crash all of 2018.
i predict that it will be down to about $4K in 2 weeks.
bitcoin is crashing and crashing hard.
to buy now would be absolute folly!
@_date: 2018-08-06 15:17:30
i see that you insult rather often
but when it comes to showing how i am "wrong on so many levels" you are unable to do so.

how does an exchange have an extra $40 million dollars to pay a soccer star?

@_date: 2018-08-16 16:58:46
youre still defending the alarmists, without even doing your own research on how so many of their claims are false?
do your own research, or not
but, for me, i do my own research
but if you don't want to, or if you want me to do it for you, thats your choice
i prefer to look into all the info.
but its so obvious that the alarmists are mostly false, i never understand why so many blindly defend them.
but its a free country, do as you choose.

i agree
i mean... its just *less* pathetic at 25
but 45 and stoned all the time like snoop?
or 45, and being stoned is the most dominant part of your identity?
thats so super lame!
p.s. i just looked it up, and snoop dog is 47 (which makes him being stoned all the time even more loserly)
@_date: 2018-05-12 03:26:01
sure, i agree
weed should be legal
all drugs should be legal.
heroin and crack too
if someone wants to do whatever drugs they want, that is their OWN business (not the govt's business)
and why does a man need to get permission from another man to get medical drugs from a pharmacy?
if someone wants to go to a doctor, thats fine.  but we are all supposed to be equal, why does a doctor have more rights to decide what drugs i can take over me?
fuck ALL the govt rules about drugs.  Just let people take whatever drugs they want to.  Seriously, we are "supposed" to be free, but when someone cant even decide what to put into their body (unless its ok with the govt) then thats not freedom.
as long as you are not stealing or harming anyone else, then sure... do weed or *any drug* you want to do
its just (for me) i choose to have a clear mind, and i find that i can go after my dreams and goals with greater energy and passion if i dont use drugs

@_date: 2018-08-06 18:18:54
so true
can you imagine telling people to hodl when bitcoin was at 20K
and then seeing it lose 70% of its value
and at each step of the way following the advice to HODL????
thats the stupidest advice ever
oh... and i'm not saying that to put anyone down
I did that stupid thing myself
i started buying btc in nov 2017, and i was told to HODL, and i did
now i lost 65% of the money i put into btc, and i am still losing value
just this week, btc is down 15%, and its still sinking
but listening to those who said HODL was the stupidest thing i ever did.
if you can get out now without losing too much money, i would say to anyone get out now, and wait until bitcoin is done crashing before re-investing
or better yet, just invest in something less volatile next time
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:31:32
This is a bitcoin discussion subreddit for those who are interested in bitcoin.
Its not a bitcoin fan club.
All opinions about bitcoin are discussed here
We all do not hold the exact same opinions on bitcoin.
Some of hate bitcoin, others love bitcoin, and everything in-between.
Some of us are bullish on bitcoin, others of us are bearish.
Some think that bitcoin will be around forever, others think its a dying technology who's best days are behind it.
and others, like me, want it to succeed, but feel like ultimately it will fail.
I don't pretend to know for sure, that is just my OPINION.
Stop acting like positive bitcoin comments are the only ones that should be shared on here.
Please accept that a diversity of opinions on bitcoin should be allowed.
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:12:10
i'm just some dude who is a member of a subreddit
and i am sharing my opinion on bitcoin
both positive and negative opinions on bitcoin are ALLOWED on here.
i don't have a secret agenda
seriously, take off your tin foil hat
i see hundreds of posts about how bitcoins going the moon, and no one accusess those people of having some sort of *motive*.
but share an opinion that is bearish on bitcoin, and all of a sudden i get attacked and accused of having "some sort of motive".
but hey.. you want to know my"motive"???
here you go
i hate bitcoin
bitcoin sucks
buyingbitcon was the stupidest thing i ever did
i lost 60% of the money i put into bitcoin
and i believe i'll lose even more, as i think bitcoin will crash even more
i'm gonna hodl, and hey... i ONLY blame myself for buying such a shitty investment
but i still hate hate hate bitcoin
bitcoin can suck my balls!
there, thats my "motive", you happy now?
@_date: 2018-05-12 05:52:12
yes, you can rest your "case".

hey, if you think bitcoin is a good choice, buy away
my opinion is that it will go down, down, down for at least two more years
i will not be buying any more until after 2020
after 2020, i will reevaluate as to whether to buy more (although, my opinion at this point is that btc will go down to the hundreds and then just stay there as a failed technology)
@_date: 2018-08-29 05:58:47


i don't know
but my guess is nope
will just slowly die off between 2019 and 2022 is my opinion

at this point its a long show bet
but most likely it'll go down, down, down
i have most of my assets in stocks and real estate
i probably should take my money out of bitcoin
youre correct. that would be logical
i guess the emotional, illogical part of me, fueled by FOMO, has me HODLing in the sinking ship that is bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-12 03:19:31
except bitcoin inspires you to be smarter and learn
whereas weed makes you dumb as shit (while youre high)
and in many people, they become "zoned out" so that they are dumb/spaced out, even when they aren't smoking
plus, smoke stinks
bitcoin doesnt make you smell gross
so, bitcoin in a plus in my book
no thanks! not MY thing.
@_date: 2018-05-12 06:48:16
hey, i would have been better off to put nothing in
sadly, i did put money in, and lost money
since my orig comment, bitcoin down another $500

this is just a subreddit on a website thats known for its cat videos and Aw photos
i don't come onto reddit for credibility
and i'm just here to talk about bitcoin with fellow bit coiners, i am not here to become a widely resected community expert
@_date: 2018-08-01 05:09:33
yes, 
if we are honest, we all know bitcoin is crashing (just as its been doing near non-stop for the last 7 months)
but the whales will be doing pump and dumps like this for a while, so they can make some extra billions from the non-billionaires, as bitcoin goes down down, down.
at this point sell or HODL (if youre feeling adventurous) but do not buy any more, as this seems like a long slide down to the bottom from here on out
@_date: 2018-08-21 02:53:30


not for me
i accumulated and lost 60%
i'll hodl what i have, but i'll never buy bitcoin again
i hate bitcoin
no more bitcoin for me
bitcoin either goes to $1,000,000 and makes me rich, or bitcoin can suck deez nuts
@_date: 2018-08-29 21:18:44
nope, i am on here often, although since ALL of 2018 has been mostly bitcoin dropping more and more, then it might seem that way
but don't blame me because bitcoin has dropped over 60% in just the last several months
@_date: 2018-08-14 01:33:49
if it ever gets to 8k again, EVERYONE will try to sell off so fast it'll make your head spin
at this point no one wants bitcoin anymore, but they are just hodling, waiting for the slightest bounce to start selling off this unwanted asset
 
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:22:09
i wasn't talking about price specifically
i am talking about the overall health of bitcoin as a whole
and bitcoin is doing poorly
thats what i was referring to
whatever the specific price amounts are is just a secondary afterthought
the real point is that bitcoin is doing poorly, and will do poorly (in my opinion) for the rest of the year
you can agree or disagree
and i welcome all opinions.  i am just saying that i think its a very bearish year for bitcoin
and people need to be aware of this
its bigger than just price, its that bitcoin is fucked until 2019 (perhaps until 2020, even)

of course, if it were a party of people who would ONLY speak positively about bitcoin (regardless of the actual truth)
then, because we are so honest, truthful, and forthright, we would not fit in
so it depends, on the party.
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:14:10

if we ever do break even it will so far in the future that sky lambos will be a thing by then.
of course... bitcoin even existing by then is a million to one shot.

@_date: 2018-08-08 03:00:42
everyone i know is like a sheep
they SAY they are for a crypto asset that is not under control of financial institutions
and then what do they do when an exchange starts demanding their ID and all their persona info just to purchase a bitcoin?
they can't wait to start sending off their IDs and giving all their info to these banks (that then turn it all over to the govt)
sadly, most people are sheep,
and bitcoin is under control of the financial institutions and the govt now

thanks u/xelephonte
and yes!
it seems weird, 
i simply express that i (as a non-expert) am bearish on bitcoin
and that in my non-expert OPINION, i think that bitcoin will continue to go down
and for simply *expressing an opinion* they attack me, and resort to name calling.
it seems like there might be something wrong with them mentally, perhaps?
anyway, i don't know.
but glad to see that everyone isn't in attack mode, and that there are some (like you) who can be polite and share positivity on here.
thanks for the kind words, and the wisdom you share.

november 2017
that was a terrible month for me
i was too stupid to see how much money i would wind up losing as a result of the process that i started that day.
my first bitcoin purchase was mid november 2017.  i wish i could go back in time and have never bought even one single bit of bitcoin
worst financial mistake of my life.
i have NEVER invested in something just to see it lose 60% of its value in only a few months
i should have just burned that money in the fireplace, at least i would have gotten something from it (some warmth and pretty fire)
as it was, i just lost a bunch of money by investing in bitcoin, and wound up with absolutely NOTHING in return

listen to the FULL interview
not just the out-of-context soundbites put out there 
@_date: 2018-08-29 16:40:56
anyone who says bitcoin is going to the moon is praised
and told how great their opinions are
but someone like me, who shares a bearish opinion on btc gets called names
sorry buddy, first of all, we are allowed to share opinions on here
and second of all, its against the rules of this subreddit to insult a fellow user
so, stay on topic, talk about bitcoin
if you disagree with me that bitcoin is going down, then say that with ideas
but insults?  naw son, thats not what r/bitcoin is about
@_date: 2018-08-06 19:25:11
i don't *EXPECT* anything from bitcoin
except for it to crash to $2000 by the end of 2020
@_date: 2018-08-16 16:40:52
there are many layers
but even civilians, knowledgable of the issues, can talk about global 'warming" politely
as this video shows
point being, their is more than one reasonable opinion besides the ones put out there by the alarmists
even the founder of greenpeace (hardly anti-environment or a shill go big oil, says global warming is bs)
@_date: 2018-08-14 03:43:53
who said i had a problem?
i am hodling
but i also hate bitcoin
after all...
i can hold an opinion and hodl bitcoin at the same time
@_date: 2018-08-15 03:57:02
yeah i am typing a few words on an online subreddit
thats sooooo "emotional"
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:23:32
yes, not a good idea to buy this dip
as its just the middle of a very deep dip thats gonna keep getting even lower for the rest of the year (might even dip through 2020 also)
@_date: 2018-05-12 03:14:38
yes, between weed and cigarettes i would say that weed is better
but (to me) smoke stinks! whether its cigarette smoke or weed smoke
plus, i have friends who will spend 1-2 hundred dollars a week on "high quality" weed to smoke
spend $200 to inhale harmful-to-my-lungs smoke that smells gross?
and it will also make my mind less focused and make me less ambitious?
NOT for me
but hey... if thats how someone else willingly chooses to spend their own money, then go for it
its just (for me) i would NEVER spend that kind of money to smell stinky smoke
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:16:16


with so many studying crypto assets, what are the odds that one of these students winds up inventing something better than the ten year old technology running bitcoin?
id say its very likely
and with something better, more stable, and newer out there, what are the odds that people will flock to it, and abandon the old technology of bitcoin?
very likely (obviously)
and if that happens, then bitcoin crashes to zero
i mean, it will take a few years.  this isn't guaranteed, but its certainly likely.
@_date: 2018-08-29 21:50:43
yes, too many greedy hands out
you nailed it, perfectly.
besides, if bitcoin is making money, and there are lots of hands out, it at least makes a little bit of sense
but all these hands out wanting a cut, and all the while bitcoin is losing 60% of its value on top of all that?
no thanks!
i'll sit out for a while
bitcoin has done nothing but lose value all of 2018, and until it can get over 20k again (which i doubt it ever will) than i will just hodl what i have and stay away
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:32:30
oh i agree with you 100%
i think that by 2020 it will be at $2K
after that? i have no idea, but it could be the point when it slowly starts climbing back up, or it might be the point that marks the end of bitcoin for good
but once bitcoin gets below $4K its gonna cost more to mine than its worth, so thats gonna be  big shift and a real problem for all of bitcoin
best strategy, do not buy any more, and get rid of what you can.  Don't even think about buying anymore BTC in 2018, as this crash is only halfway through, there is much further down to go yet
@_date: 2018-08-14 21:00:59
@_date: 2018-05-12 07:23:52


no shit
if you dont youre a retard
@_date: 2018-08-29 21:59:37
no prob
just be polite to your fellow users on here, like i do
and you'll be fine
remember, no personal insults allowed
and we should try to stay on topic and talk about bitcoin.
my opinion is that it will be down to 4000 by the end of 2018
if you disagree, prove me wrong (but don't just call names or insult in reply)
hope that helps.
peace and love to you!
@_date: 2018-05-12 07:25:02
none of your business
but i bought in nov 2017
and i'm down now
its like all of 2018 is a lessening in value
bitcoin sucks (unless you love to lose money)
@_date: 2018-05-12 00:57:03
well, i support anyone doing whatever they need to do in life
personally, to be at a job where i was using drugs, and where everyone else was also using drugs would not be something i like,
nor would that be the sort of work that I would be drawn to.
but if that makes you all happy, then go for it, its a free country (or at least it should be)
you use weed all you like, i prefer not to be under the influence of drugs
and hopefully we can all live and get along together
@_date: 2018-08-30 03:22:05
me too
i don't tell anyone else what to do with their money either
sadly, many who reply to my comments tell me what to do all the time
we need less people like those people
and more people like you and I.
@_date: 2018-08-14 23:55:41
yes, you are 100% correct, *i am attacking bitcoin*
i admit it.
i hate bitcoin!
but i also want to warn others and be helpful to noobs, especially.
you see, i was a noob once, and i lost 60% of the money i put into bitcoin.
I WISH SOMEONE HAD STOPPED ME FROM INVESTING ANYTHING INTO BITCOIN WHEN I DID.
Bitcoin sucks ...unless youre lucky enough to have been an early adopter, or if you are a pump-and-dump whale, or if youre a billionaire tech investor, or one of the corrupt bitcoin exchanges that engage in insider trading (which they all do).
but for the rest of us, its a system thats rigged AGAINST us.
from here on out, for the regular average investors, its just down, down, down (for the rest of 2018, at least)
i will never try to shield a "noob" from the truth
if anything, i want to protect the noobs from the losses that investing now in bitcoin will most likely bring them.
if you are a noob, first of all, learn all you can about bitcoin. Just sit back, watch, study and learn.
secondly, in my opinion... DO NOT INVEST NOW, it looks like bitcoin is gonna keep crashing for quite some time.
its already lost 70% of its value JUST THIS YEAR, and it looks like it will lose even more.
Best choice (once again, in my opinion) is if you are a noob, is to just sit this round of trading/buying out, wait and see what bitcoin does the rest of the year, and then (if you want to) consider buying some crypto assets IN VERY LIMITED AMOUNTS in early 2019
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:16:39
t mobile will be around
so will bitcoin
its just that, in my opinion, bitcoin will only be worth 1000-2000 by end of 2020
@_date: 2018-08-30 04:57:06
no, i am not bring up the past
i am talking about the present day
right now
and right now bitcoin is down over 60% from its high
thats today, right this second
and right now, the price of bitcoin sucks!
@_date: 2018-08-11 04:48:25
its gone down another $400 in only a few hours (on top of the $1000 drop of the last 24 hours)
bitcoin is dying
this 20k talk is nonsense
theres no more "to the moon"
its just down the toilet from here on out
@_date: 2018-08-30 02:03:31
i hope you are right
i think it will crash more
but i'd be very happy to be proven wrong by your more optimistic outlook
@_date: 2018-08-30 05:20:36


buy MORE bitcoin?
no, will never buy bitcoin again
i hate it, worst investment of my life
but i'll hold onto this shit called bitcoin that i already have
but future spending?
i'll stick with investments that make me money, not the ones that lose money
but thanks for your investment advice!
@_date: 2018-08-14 20:08:09
yes, we won't know when the absolute bottom is for sure
i am just saying, in my opinion, that is gonna keep crashing until it hits $2K at least
@_date: 2018-05-11 22:58:11
without 2A we have no freedom
without freedom we have no bitcoin
@_date: 2018-05-12 09:50:17


and its only getting worse from here on
by the way, you think that me typing and opinion is "crying"
you are seriously retarded
@_date: 2018-05-12 05:44:03
it wasn't so much about price
but about how it just seems to be a dying asset

if you are thinking that scientists, whose funding is dependent upon affirming global warming alarmism, won't alter their findings (especially when they are based on imaginary computer simulations for their end conclusions) then you still have a lesson or two to learn about human nature

thats not me
no idea who that is
@_date: 2018-08-14 23:49:11
i did buy near the top (around 14-15K averaged out)
so i am now down about 60%
i have not sold any, and i am just gonna HODL (just in case)
although... my opinion is that bitcoin will go down to 2-4K by 2020
@_date: 2018-08-20 23:54:25


no one minds the money we spend on these things
its that we give billions to drug addicts on welfare, illegal aliens, unnecessary war spending, and giving it to old people who are already wealthy
no one minds helping the poor, but if youre old and rich, you deserve nothing, and if youre able bodied, but just get high and collect welfare, you shouldnt get tax money, and same for illegal aliens, you sneak into our country against the law, and then you live off our taxes?
fuck that!
we could do just fine on less than half the taxes we currently collect, if we just got rid of the taxes spent on stupid things
@_date: 2018-08-29 02:47:56
agree 100%
just a bunch of whales getting rich over pump and dumps
it'll be down to the 6000s in a few days a week
after that? i don't know, but my guess is that'll continue sliding (until it hits 4000 or so)
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:20:39
i don't mind that you talked about how you didn't like an idea i expressed
thats fine, i was referring to the way that you broke the rules of this subreddit by calling me names, and using personal insults.
i mean, seriously, why insult me?
why not just be polite and nice to each other, like i am to you?
peace and love to you!
@_date: 2018-05-15 17:53:22
you are retarded
i primarily have my investments in the stock market and real estate, you donkey dick licking moron,
but besides those investments, i did also "dive into" bitcoin.
i'm doing fine you loser moron cum-eater
i was simply saying, scum face, that i think that the bitcoin part of my portfolio will never be worth any more than it is now.
in fact, you shit stain, sub-human... in my humble opinion, i think that bitcoin with actually go down in value over the next year.
Granted, it *could* go either way, no one really knows (especially not a glory hole worm-sucker like you) but i'm guessing its a slow descent from here on out for bitcoin.
If you weren't so busy eating diarrhea you might know this.
@_date: 2018-08-21 00:59:27
good answer
zero is the amount that someone should get from money taken from other peoples taxes
the only exception is people who are mentally retarded, or those who are physically unable to work.
everyone else, work for your own money, enough with all these govt give-a-ways

i respond politely to someone who called me an "Asshat"
and then you insult me, too.
and that makes me the troll?
I don't think that word means what you think it means.
@_date: 2018-08-11 21:43:10
you got that right!!!
if someone bought at 1k and didn't sell over 15k, then they are foolishAF
if someone bought at one k, and are still holding
dear god, why? get out now
wait till it goes down to 2k if you want to buy more
right now its in free fall!
@_date: 2018-08-06 19:37:35
yes, lets make fun of those who have bought recently
thats a great strategy for bitcoin and the bitcoin community.
the early adopters who made their money (like you) now insult and make fun of new arrivals and those who have taken a financial hit.
yeah, great plan!
let me know how that works out for you?
@_date: 2018-08-15 04:32:41


i didn't sell
but i also don't think it will ever go up again 
@_date: 2018-08-29 23:07:21
yes, i was very clear, that i was referring to 2018
before 2018, buying bitcoin was wise
those days are over
its been a bad buy since late december 2017 until now
it will continue to go down even more this year
this is my opinion, but this year has sucked, and it looks like it will only get worse
@_date: 2018-08-03 21:39:48
yes, i guess we will know that in the next decade.
thanks for *your* opinion and thoughts!
personally, i am most curious to hear from those who think bitcoin might be down to near nothing in the next few years...
and hear from those who think that when exactly (in your opinion) do you think bitcoin with crash and become worth next to nothing?
@_date: 2018-08-15 00:16:41
my BS predictions
just wait till end of august when btc is 4K
we'll see who is right then
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:50:38
since you mention climate change...
i never denied that climate changed.
has the earth ever naturally cooled or warmed?
yes, it always has
but is man causing it?
no evidencie of that.
even if the earth, for whatever reason (man made or otherwise) ,got a degree or two warmer, is that bad overall?
nope, if anything it would most likely have a positive effect on food growth (not to mention, there are many more deaths from cold, compared to heat).
but hey... even if global warming was real, and even if we wanted to slow it down, could we?
no evidence to that, either.
in other words, will the alleged "solutions" to "global warming" do anything? (other than cost trillions of dollars)
definitely no evidence of that, at all.
if we spent the same money we currently spend trying to "cure" global warming on real environmental issues like cleaning up water and air pollution (real pollution that is, not just the naturally occurring gas CO2) would that be a better use of our limited financial resources?
Yes, of course it would be better to fight real pollution, as opposed to the made up "danger" of CO2 gas.
Global warming (or "global cooling" or "climate change" or whatever else they are calling it this week) is just a ploy by leftists to gain greater power, and to collect even more taxes, and to self-enrich themselves in the process.
the leftists who are pushing global warming alarmism don't really care about the environment, if they did they wouldn't spread this lie, 
Additionally, , spreading this lie destroys our economy, and removes our freedoms.
luckily, global warming is considered a joke by anyone who looks into it.
Your average rank and file low-information voter does honestly think that the fake global warming alarmist theories are true, so they incorrectly think that supporting the global warming manipulators like al gore is the right thing to do.
we (who are truly educated on the reality of the global warming hoax) now know the truth, its just a matter of educating the rest of the public to the truth about al gore and the rest of his lying leftist ilk.
p.s if you want to educate yourself on this subject, a great resource to check out is climatedepot.com or 
i'm not saying that you have to believe those who are skeptical about the claims of the global warming alarmists, all i ask is that you just look into it, do your own research, and think for yourself on this issue.
@_date: 2018-08-14 22:56:38


wow, thats an interesting approach, insult all of us on here who bought after late 2017.  let me know how that approach of insulting many of your fellow bitcoiners works for you in spreading the message of bitcoin?


wait, so now i'm not a stupid child playing at an adults game?  i'm a super secret spy sent from some mega-corp to rig the price?
and my masterful plan is to go onto a subreddit and say i hate bitcoin?
wow, i am such a genius!
i am sure i will have such an effect on the entire worldwide bitcoin market by posting a few comments seen by at least a dozen people.
and no, i won't "get out" because you tell me to.
i will HODL (which is what i've said all along)
i don't think that bitcoin will go up, but hey... you never know
i mean, i still hate bitcoin, but better safe than sorry, i will HODL on to what i got (I just am not going to throw any bad money after good, so i won't invest even one more penny into stupid.shitty.bitcoin).
As for you, you should not insult your fellow members of r/bitcoin
you see, the way i did it, i talked about ideas and bitcoin, but i never called you a name.  Talk about ideas and concepts with passion, but be polite to people.   thats the r/bitcoin way.  Hopefully you can learn from me.  peace and love and best wishes to you!

perhaps never to come back again
@_date: 2018-05-12 06:51:49
yes, in the past people made money
sadly, after the big spike of 2017 it was over
from hear on out, its just a slow bleed
@_date: 2018-05-12 07:22:14
yeah, a loser like you?
you probably have 4 cents worth of bit coin
even after my losses, i have more than you!!!
@_date: 2018-08-09 00:41:43


another thing that can happen is that assets can crash to zero
but yes, i do agree, bitcoin has done well in the past
and its been a good deal for early adopters
sadly, thats not been the case for ANY of 2018
i believe that the good times are gone, and that its just more bad news from here on out (not saying i KNOW this, its just my opinion).
@_date: 2018-08-14 04:00:40
i am hodling.
i am just saying, in my opinion, btc will only go down even more.
but heck.. at this point, i have lost so much, i might as well ride it out and see what happens
@_date: 2018-08-11 21:55:03


yes, i agree with that
i think it will eventually go down to 100-200 within a few years
before that, it will cost more to mine than its worth, so most people will lose interest, but a few will hold on, and it will have some value.
but basically anyone who bought from 2014 onward is gonna lose most of the money they put in (unless they get out now).
either way, most people will just sell what they now own, and prices and interest will plummet, and bitcoin will go down as another great idea that just wound up not working.
but most people will move on to less complicated, less volitive crypto assets
@_date: 2018-05-12 07:23:21
im NOT buying
i'm just HODLing
@_date: 2018-08-30 05:22:31

@_date: 2018-08-30 00:51:48

it lost 60% of its value
i am hodling, just in case

yup, i don't try to be mean, but sometime i just have to set the to the moon people correct
@_date: 2018-08-16 23:27:06
sorry Dr Frued, but i'm fine with myself
myself never lost 70% of my own value in a few months
i accept blame for making one bad investment (into bitcoin) but my self worth is not tied to whether or not a particular investment works out, or not.  thats just silly to base your self worth on such a thing.
so, just to be clear, its bitcoin i hate,
as for ghee99, i ❤️ that guy!

@_date: 2018-06-23 01:45:07
oops, my bad (on the Austria thing)
oh well... being a place with the "most relaxed gun laws in Europe." doesnt mean that citizens have gun rights (as most of Europe is not free at all when it comes to the right to protect yourself).
Basically, there is no good reason for a govt to say you *need* their permission to own something to protect yourself (a govt should increase freedom, not stifle it).
and yet, even in Austria, even the most law-abiding citizen needs to receive the govt's permission to own a gun for protection.
But i get it, i live in a non-free, socialist area myself, where guns are SEVERELY restricted.
Where i live you can be arrested just for owning a gun thats legal in the rest of the nation
I mean... the weather is nice here in California, but rights for law-abiding citizens here are extremely limited.
Here in California, the elite people are allowed to protect themselves with guns (of course), but the regular "lowly average citizens"?  we are forbidden unless they have a special government permit (which they don't really allow us to get very often).

oh yes...
well said
i agree 100%
its like a company on the stock market thats down 70% from its highs just a few months before
who's gonna buy into that?
maybe some pump-n-dump investors, or perhaps a venture capitalist who wants to liquidate, or speculators looking for a long-shot win
but regular investors/users need to come back if BTC is recover
I and HODLing what I have now (I know I'm not smart enough to day trade, and its money that I invested that I could afford to lose)
and yes... I do HOPE that BTC goes to the moon!
but I also am very much aware that its just as likely (in my opinion) that BTC does not become the cyber asset of choice, and that it could go down even more.

all us early adopters made out fine, so if the whole thing is going down, who cares?
we made our money, sold out stashes like whales, and now we are just going to talk condescendingly towards anyone who bought from dec 2017 onward.
we're on the moon, and fuck everyone else (all while we keep telling everyone else to "HODL")
Yeah, thats some great attitude you have you're, buddy - thanks for showing us how some of you early adopters think!!!
@_date: 2018-06-30 19:39:02


are against Jews?
some of your other comments are fine, but Trump supporters against Jews???
haha 
Trump's own daughter and grandkids are orthodox Jews
not to mention, Trump is the most pro-Israel president in our lifetimes
I mean, you can like Trump or not, but to say him or his followers trade conspiracy theories about Jews is 100% wrong
the only groups of any size in America that are anti-Jew are liberals who support Palastine, and certain (but not all) Muslims.
i mean... sure, the KKK types are anti-Jew as well, but since they are like .00000000000001% of the population, and since you could probably fit the entire membership of todays KKK in a phone booth, I wouldn't really consider them large enough to even consider mentioning.
Anyway, real point it that Trump and the GOP are NOT against Jews (or against any group based on race, sex, nationality, or religion).  I guess thats why so many Blacks especially (and other groups, too) are joining the  movement.

@_date: 2018-06-29 06:15:31


yes yes, its always the same
"sure, other bubbles have popped, but BITCOIN is different"
this what those who invest in every bubble have said, THIS time its different (be it tulips, the internet, mortgages, etc)
yes, they are all different, but one thing is the same..
VERY often bubbles go up and down for a bit, but then eventually pop never to recover again
will BTC ever recover?
or is is just all downhill from here?
I don't know, but i am smart enough to know that BTC not coming back is a possibility
@_date: 2018-06-28 21:56:24
yes, but how many of the december buyers stuck around?
or bought more in 2018
or even are buyers that have more than $100-200 worth?
I don't know, but (as i have said before) if people  invest in something and it does bad every single month,
month after month
...after month
and the money they put into BTC in december is now worth 70% less in June, then yes...
thats bad.
and lets not forget, not only has BTC been crashing hard, it doesnt seem to be slowing down (if anything it's losing value even faster now).
so sure... being optomostic is fine (as a *personal choice*)
but at some point, i would imagine that not only are most people gonna wanna get the hell out (which will drive the price down even more) 
...but also who the heck wants to put their money into something thats lost 70-80% of its value in all of 2018?
You think we have many NEW investors coming into this crashing market?
sure... we have some hard core speculators, and the devoted fan boys, but interest is drying up fast.
Will we bounce back?
Sure, its possible.
but please be aware, that NOT bouncing back is also quite possible, too.
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:28:01
"ugh" is right!
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:34:26
you can argue about how its dropped 3 or 5 points today
i'm more focused on the big picture, like how it went from about 20K in december 2017 to below 6K in June 2018
thats a HUGE loss of value
You think many new investors will come into something thats last 70% of its value in the last 6 months? 
@_date: 2018-06-30 19:54:13
hey, how dare you introduce facts and logic into a discussion on bitcoin!!!
the only thing you're *allowed* to say on here is "HODL HODL HODL"
and 
"BUY THE DIP"
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:44:10
thats what i'm talking about
its too easy to manipulate
not stable at all
my estimate is that btc will be worth 2000 by end of 2018
and by 2020 less than 1000 per btc
@_date: 2018-06-30 19:52:13
so true
bitcoin sucks!
and no matter how bad it does now, certain people are just like "oh... but before it was worth less, and it went up, so that *means* it has to go up again"
no, thats not how economics and markets work
just because something went up and down before, doesn't mean it can't crash for good
i'll HODL for now, but this looks real bad
oh well....
I guess i (like so many others) got suckered by bitcoin
@_date: 2018-06-30 07:16:03
this is it boys, finally... its going to the moon
nothing can stop it
call the lambo dealer now, and make your reservation 
we are on the start of a HUGE bull run
it'll never stop this time
no way that bitcoin will ever go down again
it can ONLY go UP ⬆️ ⬆️ ⬆️
everyone in the world will be using BTC any day now.
@_date: 2018-06-27 00:12:14
stupidest logical fallacy that i ever heard
and i hear it on here, a lot
you might not *realize* (in the financial sense) the loss
just as you might not "officially" realize a loss on a house that you paid $1M cash for that burns down, until you sell it
but if your million dollar home burns down, and now only has a market value of $100,000
you have still had a huge loss the moment that fire got out of control and destroyed your home, whether or not you put it on the market and sell it right away
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:05:17


I have heard that for every month this entire 2018
sure, it is!
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:26:24
its bouncing around a bit, as it crashes
it was almost 8000 at the beginning of this month (and June isn't even over) and now its under 6000
+25% drop this month
and we've been dropping every month this year
soon it'll be next to nothing if this keeps up!
@_date: 2018-06-23 01:06:50

if you're referring to bitcoin, then the paper term would be *vomit bags*
@_date: 2018-06-13 20:09:40
i can relate 100%
as i said before...




@_date: 2018-06-30 19:31:32
wow, that was a short "bull run"
heading down again
@_date: 2018-06-24 06:28:14


ok, if you are fine with that, then thats shows the problem
if BTC drops to one dollar, then that means millions of people lose billions of dollars, and that SUCKS (even if you want to insist that "it would still be an excellent means of securing and transferring value").
BTC seems to be going down hard, and staying down a LONG time (already seven months of crashing, and no end in site)
will it ever come back up?
maybe, maybe not
i hope it goes back up to over 20K
but my best guess would be that it goes down to $2000 by end of 2018
down to $1000 by 2020
and after that?
who knows
but if it goes below $1000, i can't see it ever being taken seriously again
I think crypto is here to stay, but BTC is an early technology, and I think it could easily go the way of AOL (still there, but only a shell of what it once was)
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:48:40
you can use the term "FUD" all you like
my point is still the same
crypto is an extreme long shot, and people should ONLY put into it what they can easily afford to lose if it crashes (which is not guaranteed, but is certainly quite likely)
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:34:04
@_date: 2018-06-29 03:18:31
well, its at a crossroads
like amazon struggling in the early days, and then bursting through and becoming a big deal
or like AOL, having a big bubble, and then becoming (essentially) irrelevant after having been a leader in the past
whether BTC will go up, up, up or just become another also-was...
only time will tell.
(personally, i am not too optimistic about BTC, but still, I do HOPE it goes to the moon - i just kinda doubt it will any more)
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:33:41
could be worse
here in the USA its 99% 
@_date: 2018-06-27 04:59:32


when people have to choose between doing whats in their best interest, or whats in the so-called "greater good" (where the two are not the same)
people will always choose to do whats in their own best interest
thats human nature
and thats why communism fails every singe time its tried
and thats also why those who think that people who say "they believed in what bitcoin and crypto stood for" will never act in cryptos "best interest" over their own.
If crypto can't self-sustain itself, and increase in value over time, then it will die before too long
@_date: 2018-06-03 02:57:22
actually, the question to ask yourself is...
do you love to lose money?
if the answer is "yes" then you should buy bitcoin
@_date: 2018-06-12 07:09:10
so very true!
@_date: 2018-06-27 06:43:07
so true!!!
@_date: 2018-06-30 07:08:52
so true
totally relatable
at this point can we just change the name from bitcoin to money hole?
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:10:01
oh, well...
i hope you sold when it was $20K back in december 2017
if not, you lost 70% of so
i wish you the best!!!
@_date: 2018-06-28 20:03:13
guys, its down to 5 cents
that great, 500% more than when it was only worth one penny!
@_date: 2018-06-30 19:58:57
aw snap, 
you just trashed u/ebolaween2014
hey ebolaween2014, you gonna take that shit?
@_date: 2018-06-23 06:33:02
and at this rate, by next year it will only take 10 BTC to buy a hamburger
@_date: 2018-06-27 05:59:01
given the fact that you're too stupid to understand that BTC and real estate are similar in some ways (as stores of value, for example, or as investments, etc) then there is no point in me continuing to talk to a retarded person such as your yourself
@_date: 2018-06-30 07:23:52
reporting facts such as 
- BTC is down every month of 2018
- its lost 70% of its value in the last few months
- that it seems to still be losing value over all as of June 2018
No, thats not FUD
thats just reporting the facts and whats happening.
what people like you do, try to deny or silence people pointing out actual facts is the real problem
people can buy/use BTC or not, but stop criticizing those who simple point out the negative things that are actually happening right now.
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:41:07
but there is no guarantee of a bull market again
you know that, right?
for all we know, BTC could be the next enron or countrywide, or even pets.com, etc.
@_date: 2018-06-12 07:12:09
nope, because if i lose any money on my target credit card, i can have that charge reversed, and I dont lose a penny
on the other hand, people can lose nearly everything they own if they invest the majority of their wealth in bitcoin
@_date: 2018-06-23 01:05:39
 
@_date: 2018-06-15 02:49:04
a day or two?
ever since december 2017 its been more or less, just dying slowly each day
some minor peaks and valleys, but all in all, for ALL of 2018 just a real money loser
anyone who bought in late 2017 could be at negative 60-70% today
and these are people who have been HODLing for 6 months
so no... not "a day or two"
month after month, after month, after month, etc... of losses and losses
you can hope for a magical recovery (we all want that) but in reality, i think BTC is dead for some time, maybe it will just slowly dwindle down to nearly nothing over the next few years
its a total long shot, total gamble, and not likely to go back up (in my opinion)
but hey... roll the dice, keep on HODLing (I know i put some money into bitcoin, money that i could afford to lose.  I honestly feel like the most likely opinion is that i will lose all/most of that money, but if a magical long shot happens, and i wind up making money in the next few years, I won't complain).
@_date: 2018-06-28 20:10:59
january 1 2014 BTC lost more than 60% of its value?
in one day?
that was not a good day to be an invested in BTC
@_date: 2018-06-15 08:08:39
its not just pets.com
its yahoo, a shell of what it was
or worldcom
or even not tech companies like enron, or countrywide, had investors put up billions and billions
and they are gone now
I am not saying BTC will go to zero, in my opinion
my guess it that it will go to $2000 by end of 2018
and then go to $1000 by 2020
after that? i don't know, but it could go down into the hundreds
Anyway, no one knows for sure, but my personal opinion is that it will never come close to its past high of $20,000
those days (in my estimation) are long gone
@_date: 2018-06-13 19:59:19
just because bit coin rose in values from its start up to 2017 does not mean that its not over
it peaked (in my opinion) in late 2017
from here on out (once again, in MY opinion) it will either stay at around the current level of 6-7K or go down, down, down
do whatever you want, people...
but six months of non-stop HODL, and the "experts" saying they'll eat their own dicks if it doesn't go to 1 million, are enough for me
I see how its going, and I PREDICT (although i admit I do not know) that its only going down from here.
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:08:41
it SUCKS to have any bitcoin if you purchased it from dec 2017 onward
if you bought in 2018 you'd be better off burning your money as opposed to buying bitcoin with it
at least you'd get some light and warmth
but bitcoin might as well be called *money toilet* if it keeps doing what its done ALL of 2018
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:20:46
oh... excuse me
its not BELOW 5800
its just $5845
what a relief!!!
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:17:57
i don't get why this is a big deal
I know, the fee is low for BTC transfers, 
but I have always been able to transfer money from one bank account to another for no fees, from my bank
transferring money is free (unless you have a shitty bank, and a checking account with $44 in it or some such)
but bank transfers are free to those who have money, and so is buying or selling stocks (unless you're at the real low end of things)
so, even if bitcoin were free to transfer, its still only the same as cash transfers
I mean... lower BTC fees is a good thing, but its hardly a game changer to have a 4 cent fee, when all other currencies are free to transfer between accounts.
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:36:57


there you go folks

so true, the times i've shared on here about not understanding certain things, even things like how to properly set up my cold storage (or other issues about crypto assets), i was ridiculed and downvotes, and told i was an idiot repeatedly.
Its not like i am a total techno illiterate, its just that i didn't want to make any mistakes as i had heard all the various horror stories about how people messed that up and lost thousands, so i wanted to make sure i did it right (and hey, its not like any of these exchanges or ledger, etc have any actual human beings you can talk to!) when it came to things like using exchanges, figuring out fees, cold storage, etc.
anyway, the responses i have gotten when i have shared my frustrations, or asked for help have been downright hostile at worst, and otherwise are often just others ridiculing me for being so "stupid".
There have been nice people along the way, but all in all its been a mostly hostile and unwelcoming community whenever i have needed help or had questions or concerns.
And whenever i have a genuine question, i would never ask it here anymore, as it is (all in all) a hostile community to newcomers (it seems to be mostly memes and people saying "oh crypto is so great, buy more and HOLD" - but if you share any *other* opinion or thoughts, you get attacked or dismissed)
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:33:10
i'm like you, i started buying in nov 2017
and bought at various dips along the way
i've gotten REKT too
i'm not going to sell, but i now know its a total long shot/gamble
its more likely (in my opinion) that BTC goes to $2000 by the end of 2018
and winds up at $1000 or less by 2020.
And all this talk of "oh BTC will go to one million" is just nonsense.
Sure, BTC might increase in value, but I doubt it, i think its just a matter of it slowly dying, and finally settling in at around $1000 or less.
It'll maintain its value until someone invents a supercomputer/program that can crack it, when that happens it will go to zero (obviously).
I think we have time before that (mostly likely?) happens, but my overall point remains the same... the time to make money is BTC is over, and any money you do have in it, will just slowly lessen and lessen.
I can only suggest to you what I have done, which is do not put any more money into the black hole that is BTC.
Hope you make some money on what you did invest in one day (hopefully you only invested what you can afford to lose?) and hey... who knows? its a thousand to one shot, but we could get lucky, and actually make money???
but definitely cut your losses by not putting any more money into it.
@_date: 2018-06-29 02:35:40
also, real estate is pretty stable
whereas BTC has lost 70% of its value this year (and its still going down - where it will stop nobody knows?)
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:17:37
i might be losing all my money, but its not all bad...
at least i don't have to eat my dick

a bunch of multi-millionaires trading witty insults
meanwhile, the rest of us are getting killed by the ever-lowering value of bitcoin, and how its lost about 70% of its value in 2018 (and its still goin down hard)
so yeah... thats cool. don't try to help bitcoin or those of us who've been hurt...

i HATE that bitcoin is at $6000
this sucks
guess it could be worse, some people have lot 70% of their value in BTC
I am down, but not the far down as that
but shit, this month after month, and all of 2018 bear run sucks
and its still going down, down, down 
@_date: 2018-06-24 07:48:19
you have no idea what i have, or don't have in crypto
just because i am pointing out the the whole house of card COULD possible come tumbling down, people are so triggered that they start attacking me, or start to say I've invested too much
don't worry about  me pal, i only invest what i can afford to lose
its not about me, its about BTC, and things with BTC suck right now
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:52:34
well, without exchanges, then bitcoin will cease to grow, and will in fact, become lease popular and less used.
less demand = lower value.
back in the early days of bitcoin, it was a somewhat involved process to purchase bitcoin (compared to now, where anyone can just log onto an exchange and buy all they want to).
in the early days, when it was more complex to buy, the value was low.  as it became easier to buy, the value went up.
if we go back to the old ways (or even worse, if people have to use the very expensive bitcoin ATMs to buy/sell bitcoin) then the value will plummet once again.
already, we have gone from 19,000 to 6700 in six months, and my best guess would be that it will be down to 2000 by the end of 2018.
@_date: 2018-06-30 05:37:10


no one, of course
but its 250K per account
so you could do it over multiple accounts of 250K each, and still be fully insured
sadly, with bitcoin, you can lose much of it (up to 70%)
@_date: 2018-06-30 22:30:41
yes i forgot that old classic
@_date: 2018-06-28 20:04:56


you cant ever go wrong investing in new technologies ?
oh... the more you know
@_date: 2018-06-15 06:57:51


yes, but many bubbles do pop and never come back
remember many of the companies in the dot.com bubble?
pets.com or worldcom ?
they just kept going up and down, but always finished up higher than any low
people told skeptics " the same thing after every bubble."
and yet... one day, even with billions invested, their investors lost everything
so sure... there are success stories like Amazon, too
and there are other companies from the dotcom bubble that were the leaders of the time, and they are still here, but are shells of what they once were, companies like AOL or yahoo
but if you think that its impossible for BTC to go to nothing, then you are in denial
there will be certain crypto currencies that do well, but its early, there will be many more that go to nothing before the victors emerge as the big winners
will bitcoin be the big leader in crypto assets a few years from now?
maybe, but then again, it could be an early success story that just fades away into nothing like toys.com or geocities did.
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:11:25
yes, but my larger point was that BTC is a long shot, and very unlikely to go up in value again
it might (just not likely)
but sure... those who are adventurous can gamble on it (I have invested in it)
the real thing to remember is to only buy BTC with money you can easily afford to lose.
My guess is that BTC will most likely be worth 1000 in 2020 (maybe less)
I hope its worth more, but i'm not so foolish as to think that BTC going up in value is anything other than a very long shot
@_date: 2018-06-28 20:01:08
just another 3 reminders
- in 2018 bitcoin has lost 70% of its value (and it losing value every month, and still dropping in price, hard)
- just because beacon has "bounced back" in the past is no guarantee that it will do so again
- only invest what you can *afford* to lose, because it is possible that you could lose it all (or most of it)
@_date: 2018-06-29 05:21:50


yes it had a bit increase in value
that does not mean it will happen again
sure, we all hope it will
but there is no guarantee it will
and its VERY likely that it will possibly not increase, and its also likely that it could lose much more
but hey...
i guess if anyone ever says anything on here other than "it can only go up" then they get attacked
that sort of irrational fervor and lack or even being willing to take warnings with heed is exactly the environment that leads to HUGE losses.
we'll see what happens.
I am not saying I can predict the future, i am just saying (In my opinion) bit coin will very likely continue to crash, and *perhaps* never recover.
You can agree or not, but why people are so opposed to any opinions that aren't their own i don't understand
its funny, i live in the USA, and here there is something called a "democrat"
they are people who seem normal in many ways, but their brains can't accept reality (they just think things like "hillary is wonderful and Donald Trump colluded with Trump to rig the US elections")
Now, thats obviously not true, but it you say anything that opposes them, they freak out and start calling you names.
i am not saying my fellow bitcoiners are as bad as "democrats" (no one is *that* bad), but there is a certain attitude here (among many) that ONLY one opinion is allowed, and that opinion is that you can only say that bitcoin will go up.
I don't know if it will go up, i am prepared either way. and i have invested, but *only as much as i can afford to lose*.
I don't expect it to go to the moon ...but i'll be happy if it does.  Other than that, i just wish i could be able to share my thoughts that BTC is on shaky ground without getting constantly critiqued for saying so.
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:23:16
past rebounds are not proof or future rebounds
@_date: 2018-06-24 06:01:32
before enron crashed, they said it was secure, and different, and wouldn't crash
and same with the bust of many internet startups that are now long gone
or telecom giants like worldcom that are just faint memories now
i am not saying crypto is dead 
i am not even saying the BTC is dead or dying
i am simply saying that BTC dying or fading away is possible, and simple saying it won't is silly
thats what ever other bursted bubble said, too
i HOPE BTC stays around and grows
but its having a hard time right now, and there is no guarantee that it will bounce back
honestly, it could go either way.
@_date: 2018-06-28 20:08:38
so true
how is enron, and worldcom, or even pets.com doing now?
or take companies that are still here
the "top" search engine askjeeves.com still exists, but not exactly a good investment for those who bought in,
or AOL, at one time they dominated and were essentially the only game in town, hows AOL doing now?
point being, you're 100% correct, past gains are no guarantee of future gains, especially in emerging technologies and investments that are already in an inflated price bubble
@_date: 2018-06-30 19:41:05

$1000 by 2020
after that...
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:26:28

yes, but the kind of people that have $280 million are the types of people that banks will do whatever they ask, and these types get special favors (from banks and from everyone).
Sure, a regular customer might be told to wait three days for example
but the guy with the $280 million can just contact the bank president and make the whole thing happen overnight.
You see, the super wealthy live by an entirely different set of rules than me or you live under
In other words, yes... banks have "rules" but the super elite mega rich don't have to follow the rules.
The rules are bent, or even ignored, when the super wealthy are involved.

every month worse than the previous month
shit shit shit
this sucks
value down -70% since last december
fucking money hole is what BTC is (for anyone who bought anytime in 2018)
how can you not see that, ffs!!! ???

people who know that past recoveries don't mean that recoveries will continue forever
its over
the last little rally in may 2018 was a dead cat bounce (in my opinion)
its just gonna keep on going down, with a few more dead cat bounces along the way
and then its over.
at this point, its already shit, so might as well HODL on, just in case
thats what i'm gonna do, anyway...
it ever going high again is a long shot, if i *had to* guess, i say bitcoin in essentially dead (meaning $1000 or less) in 2 years
@_date: 2018-06-27 00:09:57
don't introduce logic or facts into the BTC discussion
how dare you!
just remember, we must obey ...and HODL HODL HODL
no matter what!
@_date: 2018-06-28 20:15:49
well, when you invest in something and it does bad every single month,
month after month
...after month
and the money you put into BTC in december is now worth 70% less in June, then yes...
thats bad.
and lets not forget, not only has BTC been crashing hard, it doesnt seem to be slowing down (if anything it's losing value even faster now).
so sure... waiting is fine.
but at some point, i would imagine that not only are most people gonna wanna get the hell out (which will drive the price down even more) 
...but also who the heck wants to put their money into something thats lost 70-80% of its value in all of 2018?
You think we have many NEW investors coming into this crashing market?
sure... we have some hard core speculators, and the devoted fan boys, but interest is drying up fast.
Will we bounce back?
Sure, its possible.
but please be aware, that NOT bouncing back is also quite possible, too.

bitcoin is now at 6700
this sucks
bitcoin is nothing but a money pit for anyone who bought in late 2017 and onward
my guess? bitcoin will be down to 2000 by november 2018
@_date: 2018-06-23 17:02:00
flushed out?
i am HODLing
its just that i'm also wise enough to know that if you invest in crypto, you should know that you could lose it ALL (and ONLY invest what you can afford to lose)
on the other hand, retards think that BTC can ONLY go up, not true... its a gamble.
@_date: 2018-06-23 00:04:38
its already lost 70% of its value,
and just dead cat bouncing to the bottom now
might as well HODL at this point
but just don't expect anything, odds are NOT good
@_date: 2018-06-30 07:12:26
more like a bull shit
its still in shitty territory, and down 70% since end of last year
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:47:21
yes, you give good advice
personally, i say only keep small amounts (basically what you can afford to lose) in crypto
i think it will crash, but it *could* go higher
so i keep a little in crypto, but its an extreme long shot at best, and could very likely be worth next to nothing in a few years
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:14:50
hey, it sucks
i'm HODLing for now
but i'm already in the red, and i'm gonna feel even dumber if it goes to less than 5K (which seems likely)
@_date: 2018-06-29 20:43:38
what does that have to do with anything
4 cents?
thats cool
but my bank doesnt change me any fees to transfer money from one bank account to another
a BTC might be faster (my bank usually takes one business day to do the transfer)
but if i have money in a bank account, it will only go up, not down (like bitcoin has been doing)
I am not saying Im done with bitcoin, I'm just saying that its a huge money loser for many people, some people have lost 70% of their invested money

its SHADY as shit
on nearly every level
and most people into BTC don't have their eyes open at all to any of it
they just keep on blindly repeating the HODL mantra, no matter what happens (and if you say anything other than positive things about BTC you get attacked for "spreading FUD" and for being "a newbee who doesnt know shit, and to GTFO if you don't like it)  and always... its just "HODL" no matter what.  Its the worst mindset for investing that I have ever seen, for any investment. (you're correct, this place is in the denial stage, bigly).
And point out that it loses money?  Do that and people say they are just in it to "spread the technology" LOL  yeah, right.  people are just making up any excuse to stick with BTC, even when its contrary to actual evidence or logic.
too many sheep, and the wolves are loving it.
and yes... personally i am HODLing, but i'm also VERY much aware that its a total long-shot gamble, and it could go either way (including all the way to near-zero)

@_date: 2018-06-13 16:45:38

total bear market
i'm guessing down to $2000 by end of 2018
then down to $1000 by 2020

@_date: 2018-06-29 01:23:11
exactly, BTC seems (very much) to be a dying store of value (and an even worse investment)
even illegitimate users (like in the old silk road customers) won't be using BTC as everyone now knows that BTC is easy to trace.
illegitimate users will use one of the anonymous crypto currencies.
As for BTC, the bloom is off the rose, and its just a huge loser of value (lost about 70% of its value in 2018 alone).  No one wants to jump onto this sinking ship, and no one is defending it, other than a few fan bois and those who profit off of others buying BTC (such as exchanges)
BTC had its 15 minutes of fame, but there are more now more modern cryptos that do the same thing but better.
I predict BTC will be essentially dead in the next few years, its just a matter of seeing which new crypto currency will emerge as the winner.
I doubt its any of the ones currently out there, will probably be a crypto currency introduced by Amazon, or google, or some big tech group that can guarantee it, give it some stability, and have the market force to make sure vendors accept it, en masse

keynesian economics is the stupidest set of ideas to ever take hold
they are the basic ideas behind much of leftist economics, and keynesian economics have destroyed more national economies than any other set of ideas (other than socialism, of course).
if you want to learn about what really works (economically) then read Friedrich Hayek (or if you dont feel like doing that, just go on youtube and watch videos by Milton Friedman)
but dont walk, run... as far away as you can from the teachings of John Maynard Keynes!
@_date: 2018-03-31 04:57:17


are you serious?
the govt just transfers capital?  or does the govt take even more money from the industrious members of a society, to give it to those individuals and businesses that the govt supports?
the govt takes money from the people (in taxes, qualitative easing, or debt) and then doles it out.  This makes the govt larger (because it takes some for itself, not to mention the waste and corruption in any large govt bureaucracy) and more powerful, and its taken from the working part of the economy has that money drained from it (you can call it "borrowing" but guess who pays it back, the people).
its the same principle as socialism, just on a more limited scale.  Not to mention, when a govt picks favorites, it rarely does so on merit, it does it through crony capitalism (TARP is a perfect example of this sort of near-total corruption).
The USA remained mired much longer due to the crony capitalism/keynesian policies of obama, the UK has much more socialism, so it was just worse than obamas plan (which still didnt make obama's pork-u-lus a good plan, just one that was not as bad as the socialism of britain).

he didnt say mexico was full of rapists, listen to Trumps full comments.
he was referring to how many of the ILLEGAL aliens coming to America were criminals, and thats accurate
No one (including Trump) should be criticized for telling the truth, even if that truth is politically incorrect.
I mean hey... you can like Trump or not, but I think we can all agree that the numbers dont lie, and ILLEGAL aliens commit crimes at much higher rates than legal American citizens.
here you go, see for yourself (this is just one study, but the evidence is the same in almost all studies):

as for hillary, i never said lock her up (youre just using straw man arguments)
personally... yes, i do think that someone should look into her actions, and then prosecute her if she's guilty (but thats a totally seperate case)
as for Trump/Russia "collusion" just show me even one speck of real evidence (from 2 years of investigating) and i'll take it seriously
but thus far its all just reporters for anti-Trump sites saying "anonymous sources close the investigation" say this or that
how about some evidence? some proof?
seriously, like Trump or not, the level of fake news on this whole russia thing is insane.

nothing personal, but when you say things like that, you sound like the SJWs who compare their idealized version of socialism against actual working models of capitalism (as opposed to comparing capitalism to the endless examples of failed socialist states).
it doesnt matter what the theoretical, utopian, version of an economic theory is.  what matters is what happens when you a country actually implements it.
in the case of keynesian economics, the result is always the same, more money taken from the people, and more money given to an ever-expanding govt.
and i think all reasonable people can agree, that the US govt has grown too powerful, too meddlesome, and that it over-spends much too much.
so, less keynesian economics, less crony capitalism, and more free enterprise.

No, I dont think that if the Jews in ww2 Germany were armed, it would have mattered much (as, at that time, Jewish people were only .75% of the German population). 
On the other hand, in a country like the USA, where 50% of the American people are heavily armed (and where we have over 300 million guns in civilian hands), then it could make a difference.
Thats not to say that one household could take on the US military or govt agents, but taking over all of America, against the will of the people, would be nearly impossible, no matter how heavily armed the government was, due to the number of armed household we have.
I mean, look at vietnam, or even better yet Afghanistan.  Rag-tag, but heavily armed civilians have been able to defeat the world's most powerful armies (the British, then the Soviets, and most recently the US).
Anyway, back to the US.  Its true, the USA is not a tyranny or evil dictatorship at the moment, but if you look at the history of mankind, evil murderous dictatorships appear time and time again. 
In just this last century, evil governments have killed 100 million of their own citizens. To think that it could never-ever happen here is naive.

Thats not to say that i excuse any bad actions that coin base has done (I have said over and  over that i am not defending coinbase).

and there is no way to say (for sure) that value wont go down to $1000 or less
Personally, i think the next couple of years will be bitcoin in the 2-3K range

After I posted that comment, I was temporarily banned (and rightly so, I had broken the rules, after all), and this note was sent to me by a mod:
 &gt; "You need to keep political discussion off this subreddit.
I don't care what your leanings are, it only incites arguments that devolve into pure off topic nonsense.
You might not feel like that is the case, but you haven't seen the snowball effect play out the way we have."
I had to promise not to be political (which I have done) to be re-instated.  
But now i see a very political comment like this post, so I just wanted to (politely) let you know that political comments are banned on here, and that you should respect the rules, AND you should respect the mods and what they say!
:) 
I have no specific opinion (that I am expressing here) about your post, other than its clearly political, which is not allowed.
I am not a mod, so its up to them (not me) to ban you, but I did just want to let you know that you were violating the rules of r/bitcoin by posting political comments.

the 08 banking crash was (mostly) due to the govt being TOO involved with banks, and because of too much regulation/rules
less govt rules/regulation/interference on banks, the healthier the economy will be

no, i mentioned, russia, china, viet nam, afghanistan, turkey ....and germany (as just a few examples in my case for less govt gun control)
you saying that i limited to just russia and germany is false.
In fact, i would say that guns wouldn't have helped the Jews very much in ww2 Germany (also, i did not say that *every* country that has gun control commits mass murder on its own citizens).
heres a few things you (obviously missed):








In just this last century, evil governments have killed 100 million of their own citizens. To think that it could never-ever happen here is naive.

well, i certainly do have an opinion on that
but hey.. the admins asked me not to share ANY political opinions on here, and they even temporarily banned me for sharing a political opinion
but i'm back now, and i said i wouldn't share any political opinions on THIS subreddit
i mean, if you are curious about my political opinions, check my post history
but as far as sharing a political opinion on r/bitcoin ?
nope, i will not do that, because the mods have asked me not to do so.

would you rather they buy a bunch of multi-million dollar lofts in SF and NYC instead?
or is it better that they spend millions in a place that really could use the economic activity?
i mean, its not like they are drug dealers (whose wealth comes with crime, murder and death)
they are just crypto traders, investor, miners and business owners.  the worst they can do, if they fail, is not pay their rent.  And no matter what they wind up doing, just being there is bringing money and economic activity into a devastated economy
Surely youre not saying they shouldnt live so well, as others around them are suffering?
because... the suffering will be there either way, and there will be less suffering overall (in the days ahead) if puerto rico becomes an economic success

Do you ask people with us dollars in the bank "when will you sell your dollars?"
Of course not!
Its the same with bit coin, you don't sell ever.  you just hodl on, and then use some when you need to purchase something.
Its a form of currency, not just something you keep for a while, and then wait to dump.
Nothing personal, but to even ask such a question, shows that you dont really "get it".
@_date: 2018-02-17 02:36:16
well, i personally agree with the founder of greenpeace, and the creator of the weather channel, and many others, that global warming alarmism is much ado about nothing (which is not to say we dont face ecological challenges, I'm just saying that co2 is not one of them, not is the "planet heating up" anything to worry about.)
but, if you want to read some actual scientific articles refuting the hivemind, then there are plenty of scientific articles on climate depot.com
(although, to be honest, i doubt even the truth will help, as ...to so many... global warming is more like a religion or belief system, and no matter how its shown to be faulty, the acolytes just keep on chanting the mantra that the planet is doomed)
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:41:39


of course, in the last century, countries that enacted gun control went on to kill 100 million of their own civilians

i am against the bailouts, bit IF you really want to give away hundreds of billions after a banking crisis (that was caused by crooked banking practices) then dont give that money to the bankers that caused it
just give the money to the individual people who lost money or their homes
I mean, the govt shouldnt be involved at all, but IF its gonna play santa claus, then at least give it to the people, not the banks that caused it all

that was the worst "music" i ever heard

@_date: 2018-03-06 06:15:52
although... best plan (for those who still think in terms of "selling")
is to buy one bitcoin now, and then hold onto it until the value reaches 1,000,000 dollars (that should take about 10-11 years, if all you have is just one bit coin).
still, $1 million is a nice nest egg to have (although, if you buy 2 bitcoin now, you'll have 2 million in a decade, and so on and so on)

but investing 200k when it was 18.5K was incredibly stupid

he should have invested it bit by bit.  if he did that, he would have spread his losses, and would have bought a lot of it at MUCH less
doesnt matter if he can "afford" it, its still a dumb way to invest in something like bitcoin
he could have double the amount of bitcoin if he did it the way i suggest

i was referring (in the larger sense) to the way the global warming alarmists are so upset about co2.

So many fallacious arguments, but i'll just focus on your greatest logical fallacy.
My arguments are correct, or not, regardless of whether i post on r/The_Donald or not.
Bringing up unrelated details to personally insult me, to counter my argument on the efficacy of gun control, is what is know as an ad hominem attack, and it is used (most often) when the person implying it has a weak (or no) argument in reply.  Whatever your reasoning for using such an attack, it does not further your position in any way (if anything, it weakens it).

yes, *most* music (of all genres) was pretty bad in the 90s 
i mean, dont even get me started on how horrible 99.9% of grunge "music" was.
so yes... i agree, 90s music was (all in all) not that great
I'd say rap music of the 70s and 80s was the truly creative era for that form
into the 90s, there was still a fair amount of good rap
but since then, nearly 100% of pop-rap is horrible

except that youre ignoring one thing, that you cant spend your way into prosperity
and also, if your goal is increase wealth, then govt spending (with a few exceptions) is by far the worst way to do that.
want to increase a countries wealth? then remove unnecessary over-regulation, reduce govt meddling, and reduce taxes on people and business.
you see, the govt cant really create wealth, its individuals and businesses that do that.  the best thing that a govt can do is get out of the way of those who are creating wealth and prosperity.
sadly, our modern day greedy, and ever-growing govt just has its hand out, and wants a share of all wealth.

well, we are not taught just one economic thought (here in America).
Austrian economics is solid and fact based economic theory that works, but we have freedom of speech so bad economics is taught as well.
For example, keynesian "economics" is just mindless drivel spouted by leftists who dont want to admit that they are really socialists (which is an even worse economic model), and yet its taught in many of the leftist indoctrination centers that we call universities.
Anyway, its not about predicting every bubble, its about following economic principles that work.
So, in that sense, just fight against leftist economic nonsense, and stick to what works (that applies to bitcoin, the fed, or whatever currency or measure of value you are choosing to use).

co2 is a natural gas (not a pollutant)
there is nothing bad with slightly higher co2 levels (no matter what the global warming alarmists tell you)
if anything, a slightly warmer planet with slightly higher co2 solves many problems (including deaths by cold weather and lack of food).
i mean, if you dont want to eat meat because you care about animals, i salute you, but if youre doing it to "save the planet" youre just being led astray by the global warming alarmists and their puppet masters

50cents music (if he even still raps, anymore?) is pretty bad too.
On a personal note, I'm glad 50cent was smart enough to deny he had crypto (thats what all smart hodlers do).

its more a case of there being inactive/forgotten or abandoned accounts with no use on the accounts for years
and coinbase didnt make an effort (or enough of an effort) to contact the owners of the accounts or track them down
in that case, greedy california state says that you have to give all the money in those accounts to us, you know so we can "keep it safe".  california will put the abandoned account owners names on a random website, but california wont contact the owners or do anything to track them down either.
if the owners somehow go to the california website, and find their names, they they owners of the abandoned accounts will be able to get that money back (minus the fees that california will take out).
but in most cases the money jut sits in a california govt account for a few years, no one claims it (which is what greedy california wants) an then california, which did nothing to earn the money, just keeps is.
fuckin' california, god i hate this state of mine!

did you see him last friday on Real Time? (on HBO)
he was raging out against America for 20 minutes
yes, Vicente LOVES Americans who are fellow members of the elite class
But hey hates, looks down upon, and insults regular regular, working Americans and our concerns.
And (according to Vicente Fox) if someone voted for Trump, they are just too dumb to vote in their own interests, and not only that (according to Fox) they are racists and bigots.
I mean, hey... he's entitled to his opinion, but in MY opinion, i find him to be angry, nasty, completely self-serving, and VERY divisive.
plus, he is definitely into the whole globalist/NewWorldOrder elites-know-whats-best movement
and fuck those who are corrupt elites thinking they can rule over us, and pass laws that we oppose.

even now, i saw that the govt is taking under-age children away from their parents because the parents wont agree to let the kid take hormones to change their gender.
i mean... if an adult wants to be the opposite sex, more power to them (its a free country)
but a parent should be allowed to have some say about whether their underage child should be taking powerful hormones with unreversable effects.
sadly, thats not the case anymore, if youre underage child wants to be a different gender, then you have to let them (and if you dont the govt will take your child from you) 
anyway, the govt has grown MUCH to powerful and intrusive (in nearly every aspect of our lives) and as such, the obvious first step is to reduce the power and intrusive over-reach of the govt and its agents into all of our lives.

well, it wasn't neckbeards that the nazis were after, it was the Jews.
having said that, I dont think that if the Jews of the ww2-era Germany were armed, it would have mattered much (as, at that time, Jewish people were only .75% of the German population).
On the other hand, in a country like the USA, where 50% of the American people are heavily armed (and where we have over 300 million guns in civilian hands), then it could make a difference (if the govt ever became tyrannical or oppressive). Thats not to say that one household (or simply a few random neckbeards) could take on the US military or govt agents
....but taking over all of America, against the will of the people, would be nearly impossible, no matter how heavily armed the government was, due to the number of armed household we have.  Its all about critical mass, a fiercely independent attitude amongst the people, and having enough people that are armed.
I mean, look at vietnam, or even better yet Afghanistan. Rag-tag, but heavily armed civilians have been able to defeat the world's most powerful armies (the British, then the Soviets, and most recently the US).
Anyway, back to the US. Its true, the USA is not a tyranny or evil dictatorship at the moment, but if you look at the history of mankind, evil murderous dictatorships appear time and time again. In just this last century, evil governments have killed 100 million of their own citizens. To think that it could never-ever happen here is naive.
In other words, *Not every country that enacts gun control murders millions of its citizens (obviously), but every country that murders millions of innocent people does enact gun control first.*

yes, but it was (allegedly) set up to be an investigation about whether Trump colluded with Russians to influence the election of 2016
all the guilty pleas are for things that have nothing to do with the 2016 election (or Trump himself).  I mean, going after every single person ever involved with the Trump campaign (including part time campaign volunteers), and then finding out if they EVER did *anything* illegal is hardly the original point of the investigation
Sure, finding out that some people who briefly worked for the Trump campaign might have evaded taxes (or similar things), decades before the campaign even happened, is more of a witch hunt that a real investigation.
As for any actual real evidence that Trump or the Trump campaign colluded or worked with russians to influence the election, there has been ZERO EVIDENCE of that
I will repeat myself.... ZERO EVIDENCE.
So, until you have any actual evidence, just repeating made up claims spread by anti-Trump "news" outlets does NOT prove anything.
@_date: 2018-02-28 20:09:27
i agree, the US govt (police included, in many cases) are, all too often, too heavy handed in their use of force, and their siezing of power from the American citizens they rule over.
Although, the issue isnt simply "how many people did a govt kill?" (in other words, if the police killed dangerous, armed criminals in self-defence or to protect others, thats not the same as killing innocent people).
What I was talking about, when I complained of "oppressive governments that murder their citizens", I was saying I was specifically opposed to the murder and killing of innocent civilians.
Even my numbers from my original post referred to the murder of innocent civilians (I did not count war time deaths, or the deaths of violent armed criminals).
Germany introduced gun control, and then went on to kill 10 million **innocent** (and unarmed) people.
Russia introduced gun control, and then went on to kill 40 million **innocent** (and unarmed) people
Turkey introduced gun control, and then went on to kill 1.5 million **innocent** (and mostly unarmed) people
Not to mention, China  introduced gun control, and then went on to kill 50 million **innocent** (and unarmed) people.
Which is hardly the same as those who dies as a result of US police actions.  Sure, there are some abuses by police, but they are not killing millions of people who have been disarmed by national gun control policies.  Anyway, hope that clarifies, and explains the issue that i was talking about (not the unrelated side issue of abuse by police, which we **all** are opposed to by the way).

that includes the the 1.5 million innocent civilians killed by Turkey
and the 40 million civilians killed by Russia
(and thats not even counting the 50 million civilians killed by Mao in china AFTER he banned guns).
I'm not talking about people killed in wartime (although that 20 million number is hardly accurate)
I was talking about citizens that were *killed by their own govt*, after their own govt made guns illegal for citizens to own.

In the USA, i have the opportunity to protect myself, if i'm in the UK, the wimpy little unarmed cops cant do anything but yell "please stop mr criminal, sir!"
no thank you.  I'll stay armed, and safer, and not depend upon a cucked govt official to look out for me while i sit there as a helpless victim.
and yes... i am happy (as are most Americans, except the crybaby liberals melting down over our new, bold president).  I know i have tried to go to as many countries as I could, i suggest you come and check out the USA for yourself, as opposed to just trying to insult us from afar.

Also, Canada just passed a law authorizing the govt to take away trans children from parents who dont support their transformation (just google it).
Note: I am not against any ADULT being trans, its a personal choice, but if parents want to stop their underage child from transitioning (while they are children), then I support the parents rights to be in charge of whether or not their child undergoes major medical treatments.  The govt shouldn't take their children away from them.

@_date: 2018-02-22 23:03:31
The govt makes money laws that are WAY too complex for the citizen to understand
because (almost) no one understands these insanely complex laws, no one opposes these ridiculous laws.
but if a citizen gets involved in something the govt doesnt like (such as marijuana and/or bitcoin) and the govt will use these complex laws to jail you.
And hey... I'm not saying i approve of using marihuana or hash - i mean people *should be* free to do what ever they want (as long as they are not infringing on anyone else's rights) , but i would never *personally* want to use drugs or go through life in a fog of marijuana intoxication.
I am simply saying that the govt (as it now exists) is the enemy of the people.
Thats why i totally support those who want to drain the swamp, reduce govt over-regulation, and just want the govt to do what the people actually want.
Bottom line, generally speaking... you can not trust the govt to look out for your best interests, and since you cant totally get rid of the govt (they do some necessary things after all) then the best option is just to limit the size, scope, income, and power of the govt.

all that is well and good (and thanks for the technical explanation - very helpful)
but the real bottom line is that the govt should not have anything to do with whether or not one willing party wants to sell bitcoin to another willing party
its none of the govt's business (or it *should not be* any of their business)
how about we just tell the govt to stay the hell out of our business, and our lives?
we need to reduce the power of the govt.  they are abusing our rights, destroying lives and productivity
the govt needs to get back to basics, and stop meddling in the personal affairs of the citizens.

I respectfully disagree
There's nothing wrong with righteous indignation.
I am outraged and upset at how my state of California tramples on, and ignores the Constitutional rights of those of us who live here.
I am am happy to fight against those corrupt CA politicians who act in ways that are in opposition to the will of the people who elected them.
The only time that being outraged is problematic is if it paralyses someone into inaction (that hasn't happened with me), or if it causes someone to slip into victim-mentality (I never do that, i just honestly look at the way things are, whether i like them that way or not, and then try to improve them from there).
I dont blame anyone else (even the corrupt politicians in the US and California govt) for my problems.  If i am successful &amp; happy, its up to me, not anyone else.
But, if in working on being my best self, i can also help stop the corrupt actions of an oppressive govt, all the better.

no one has pleaded guilty to colluding with Russia to influence the 2016 election
MORE importantly, there is no evidence (Zip Zero Zilch) that Trump or the Trump campaign in colluded with Russia to rig the 2016 election
I mean, if you have ANY evidence, then lets see it (I'm waiting)
Did people who worked for Trump plead guilty to crimes that had nothing to do with colluding with Russia? yes, but as I said... there is no evidence that Trump or the Trump campaign in colluded with Russia to rig the 2016 election.
I mean, you have to wake up.  Just because a wacko like Richard Maddow, or some Fake News site *says* Trump colluded, that doesnt mean its the truth.
as far as "4 guilty pleas"  sure... some people that worked for Trump might have pleased guilty to some stuff, but no one has pleaded guilty to anything that has anything to do with Trump and Russians "colluding" (or whatever made up charge the crooked FBI leadership is using as an excuse for this beauracratic coup).

well, you just bring up another reason store might not want to use bitcoin
with credit cards the store will be charged 3-4% fee (small merchants pay a little more, and some big stores might pay as little as 2%)
but the fee is reasonably low, that the store can justify it (without having to have separate prices for credit compared to cash, which turns off consumers, and discouraged credit card use).
on the other hand, bit coin processing systems are all over the board, charging anything from 8-18% in fees to the stores that use them.  Meaning that its hard to offer competitive prices on anything paid for in bitcoin
and as a consumer paying in bitcoin, you are going to be gouged, compared to if you bought with fiat or credit, just to adjust for the high third party bitcoin fees

there is a difference between being critical of bitcoin (which I did) and being critical and personally insulting fellow users of r/bitcoin (which you did)
please understand that sharing a variety of opinions on bitcoin (good and bad) is what we do here
bitcoin is a made up thing, you don't need to rush to it's rescue every time someone is critical of bitcoin
if you think bitcoin is great, and i think it sucks, thats OK.  More than one opinion is allowed on here
after all, being tolerant of more than just one opinion or point of view is a more enlightened way to be.
I hope you are able to be more accepting and loving towards your fellow r/bitcoin users on here, without feeling any need to ever insult those of us who do not have much faith in bitcoin
thank you for your consideration in what is hopefully our shared goal of an even better bitcoin subreddit!!!
p.s. As for you saying...


some on here feel there is more upside, some feel bitcoin is crashing hard never to re-cover.  Its not just ONE opinion that exists on here!

you don't know anything about billionaires
many are more frugal than your average middle class money waster
and many super rich, watch their money very closely
i know a billionaire (or i did, he recently passed away) but he drove a prius, a 16 year old prius
and lived in the same house that he bought BEFORE he was rich, a cute little three bedroom in an average (NOT fancy) neighborhood in LA
You would be surprised how many super rich are amongst us
You see, people like you get your ideas on what rich people are like from watching beverly hills reality shows
thats not how most rich are
even an average billionaire is VERY happy to make 4M
that you think they don't care shows you to be a phony
come back and talk about rich people, once you actually know a few of them
@_date: 2018-07-12 20:54:43
but thats McAfee talk

@_date: 2018-02-23 03:21:04
Agreed with the first part, although instead of getting rid of it, why dont we just start following it?
Most Americans are pro-Constitution anyway, its just the radical leftists and their crooked politicians in DC that are against the US Constitution
That seems to make MORE sense to me.
(besides, if radical leftists wont listen to the Constitution now, if we change to a new document, they'll just start ignoring that when it suits them.  Point being, we cant start doing things just because leftists want us to)
@_date: 2018-07-12 19:15:56
Looks like bitcoin is going down
WAY DOWN
will this bear market ever end?
or will it just keep crashing?
7 months of lower and lower and LOWER prices
All i do is lose money in this thing
Is anyone else just sick of losing money with this whole BTC thing?
(I know i am!)

sure, and it could go to $0 in minutes, too
I don't think it will (go to zero)
but down to $2000 by the end of 2018?
yes, in my opinion, thats very likely
@_date: 2018-07-15 14:49:30

@_date: 2018-07-12 20:20:50
yeah, i was actually up more than double what I paid at one point
should have cashed out (at least what I had originally invested), but i fell for the hysteria and all the "to the moon" talk
...and now I've lost 60% of what i put in.
And, every time i go and look at BTC's value, it goes down
Looks like its about to go below 6K again
and it been nothing but a money-loser basically all of 2018 thus far (and looks like I'll be down even more by the end of 2018).
all the excuses (such as its a whale, or its chinese new year, etc - and it will pop back way up) never panned out.
its basically just straight down (with a few dead-cat-bounces along the way)
Oh well... it was a no-so-fun ride.
Congrats to those few who go in and made some money, but for the rest of us, it basically sucked big time (and its only getting worse)
@_date: 2018-07-14 01:35:29
and it seems like its heading towards $0 a lot faster than its heading to $1M
I don't think it will go to zero, but its definitely been crashing a long time, and continues to crash even now

@_date: 2018-07-15 03:33:27


yes, I agree 100%
for regular people, bitcoin is not about getting rich (all that we are making a "better money to save the world" is just a way to sucker people into losing even more of their money to the manipulators and feeling OK about it)
On the measure of success based on is it a good investment, or can you get rich off of it?
modern day bitcoin is a total failure thats screwed over many good people (the kind of good people that, in many cases, cannot afford to lose money).
BTC hurts those in need the most, and the rich fucks that don't need help are the ones who got richest off of our investment!
You see... No one gives a shit about the "principle of changing money for the better" if they lose 70% of their price in under 7 months.
Thats why the BTC community that used to be totally hung-ho and "to the moon" and used to love bitcoin, now has thousands and thousand of us who hate the fucking thing.
I didn't lose 70%, but close (I'm down 60%)
fuck bitcoin, its done nothing but lose my money.
I'm not well off, and yet my money is going to a principle thats just making whales and tech billionaires even richer?
fuck that, fuck them fuck bitcoin.
its been crashing for 7 months, and is STILL crashing hard (with no end in sight).
At this point I hope it just goes to nothing.
And some super rich guy (whose already made his pile of money) lecturing the rest of us to stay in for the "principle of changing money to better the world".
fuck ALL that noise.
BTC sucks, and all its done is cause million of people to lose billions of dollars (all while making some rich silicon valley techies even richer while the rest of us suffer).
Oh, and as for all the tech types that got in early and made money and then now insult and attack those of us who lost money, you are the worst!
*You all made your boatloads of money, and then mock the rest of us who lost out.* Those who mock us who lost money are the lowest of the low, the scum of the scum.
Bitcoin is a failure, and i can't wait for it to die. Its a shit system, controlled by whales, crooks and billionaire pump and dumpers. BTC = total failure, just a tool to take money from those in need, and give it to the ultra elite super-rich.
@_date: 2018-07-12 19:18:37


its not that they hate bitcoin, per se
but anyone who's put money into it in the last 7-8 months, hates that they are losing up to 70% of their hard earned money that they put into bit coin
and then...
when they say that losing tons of money in bitcoin sucks, they get attacked and told they are just spreading FUD, and also told things like "if you don like it, get the fuck out!"
so yeah... losing your money sucks, and not being *allowed* to talk about how it sucks without getting attacked or insulted sucks too
so its not BTC, but that sort of thing that people hate
@_date: 2018-07-13 21:59:30

thats not a rise, bitcoin has been crashing (almost continuously) the last 6 months

BTC is just going down, more and more, with no end in site

that all you have
i rest my case
you are now roasted
p.s. Trump fired Comey because he was a liar, and he spied on a candidate and US citizen
plus, he let crooked hillary off, and ignored the many crimes of the deep state.
i mean, i can admit when a republican is bad (for example, george w bush was one of the worst presidents ever and he was an idiot who got the USA into unjust, unnecessary, imperialistic wars)
other republicans suck too, like mccain the warmonger, or linsey "amnesty" graham, etc.
and comey, at least in name, is a republican, and he sucks it big time!!!
sadly, leftist seem unable to be critical of one of their own, or be critical or anyone who attacks Trump
I have even seem some liberals praise the creepy porn lawyer, and the porn star he represents

@_date: 2018-07-20 18:17:03
i hope youre right
in reality, i think that we are gonna keep crashing (as we have been doing the last 7 months)
this, in my non-expert opinion, is just a dead cat bounce.
..or more likely, just the "pump" part of a pump and dump
the pump has a already happened, and now the dump begins (hence the already dropping values)
it will drop even more, then the whales will buy more, I'm preparation for their next pump and dump
and meanwhile everyone else is just being played for suckers by these billionaire market manipulators
@_date: 2018-07-12 20:59:12
BTC is inflation proof?
You got that right
I put my money into BTC, and it deflated 60% of my money away!
definitely no inflation there!
@_date: 2018-07-14 09:53:22
its been dropping for over six months now
no sign of slowing down, the crash continues HARD
i think it will keep on crashing all this year
probably won't stop until it hits $2000
I'm no expert, but things are VERY bad for BTC these days (all of 2018 has been bad, in fact)
@_date: 2018-07-13 21:56:57


its worth $400 LESS than it was last month
and its still spiraling downward
its been going down nearly non-stop for 6 months straight, and its still crashing hard
you can have faith in BTC or not, but we need to get out of denial and at least admit that bitcoin is in serious trouble, and there is no evidence that this crash will be ending anytime soon.
@_date: 2018-07-15 02:40:00

sure, I live in LA, I was a leftist once myself
I ONLY know leftists (at least of EVERY single person I know in Los Angeles)
I am surrounded by liberals/leftists in my personal life, my work life, and everywhere i go in my home city.
Like i said, i was even a leftist once myself
then... I walked away.
I am not saying that you *should* walk away (thats a personal choice) but its always wise to be open to ALL options.
I mean, yes... I support Trump, but not blindly.  As long as he is doing things I support and that are good for America, i will support him, and if he ever stops doing whats best for the USA, I won't.

i agree with this
also... that BTC comes back at all depends on one very unlikely (in my opinion) thing.
it won't come back if a better cyber asset is invented
Its not guaranteed, but... its certainly VERY likely that someone, somewhere will invent something better
or even if someone doesnt invent something better, they could just put out their own version of bitcoin.  And if the one putting out the new cyber asset were powerful enough (such as Amazon or google, or even apple, etc) people could flock to the new "googlecoin" (or whatever), and abandon bitcoin.
I mean, bitcoin will still be there, but its value will be minuscule compared to what it once was.
I am still going to HODL, but that bitcoin will go up in value again (other than a few dead cat bounces) seems VERY unlikely in my personal opinion
@_date: 2018-07-31 22:19:10
wow, 
you missed it big time!
it lost so much value today, and the last few days!
oh well....
maybe in a few more months there will be some green candles again
@_date: 2018-07-13 23:58:29
yes, just because the most stable investment instrument ever bounced back is hardly proof that the very new, and unstable BTC will also bounce back
you do know that, right?
@_date: 2018-07-13 23:57:38


its crashing
its been crashing for 6 months straight
and its still crashing hard
all those reasons don't overcome the reality that btc is down 70% since last winter
you can try to excuse how were in a crash that shows no signs of ending, but that still doesnt excuse how it is doing so poorly, with no end in sight!

so fun!!!
can't wait to lose even more in the second half of 2018

Yes, the establishment republicans, and just about every democrat have taken the USA off the path of following the Constitution
Bush was horrible, and obama even worse.  I truly believe that had hillary been elected that would have been the end to a free America.
Luckily, that disaster was avoided, and there is at least a possibility of returning to the principles that made America great in the first place.
Will Trump be able to do it? is he up for the job?  Its too early to tell (yet) but there have been some good signs thus far.  I'm willing to give him a chance, and see what happens.
If we are still heading in the right direction (generally speaking) not year, I'll give Trump his due.
In the meantime, i only looked briefly at that website, but it seems (at first glance) to be based AF.  I'm going to have to look it over some more.  Thanks for sharing.
And even if we dont agree 100% on all/every issue, you seem so very reasonable, and focused on actual ideas (as opposed to the left and their obsession with propaganda and emotions) that I'm glad to hear your opinion and thoughts as part of any discussion.

i seriously doubt it, but hey...
no one knows for sure
anything is possible
i'm just saying (in my opinion) its not likely
i think btc rose for the last time in 2017, and its just downhill from here on, until it stops (at around 1k would be my best, non-expert, guess).

you get your financial advice from twitter?
I'm no expert on twitter, but isn't that the site where some tech billionaire "bitcoin expert" said he would eat his own penis if bitcoin doesnt go to $1 million dollars per bitcoin?
ah... OK
it all makes sense now
I understand why you think bitcoin is doing fine.
thanks for the advice, but I don't even know what medium is (some hipster millennial site?)... and twitter?  LOL, not my thing, too much nutty talk and fake accounts on there for me to even want to waste one second reading about twitters

fucking BTC is a joke
just a stupid money losing scheme (and yes, I'll admit it, it got me good)
anyone (like me) who bought from late 2017 onward got screwed
...and we're losing more with each new day
I don't *know* that BTC will crash, but its already lost 60% of the money i put into it, and my best guess is that i will lose even more by the end of 2018
@_date: 2018-07-14 01:42:19
yes, they can manipulate it a lot
they might just break it, totally (and then the price will go down to zero)
they can't manipulate it too much (for example, they can't manipulate it up to $50K)
for now, I think they'll just manipulate it, up and down (like they are doing now), do lots of pump and dumps for a couple of years, and make billions off of the regular investors, and speculators
eventually, everyone will know its a scam, and no one will want BTC, and it will die.
at that point the scammers and whales will just move on to their next scam, and the average investors and *true believers* will be left penniless

I'm not well off, and yet my money is going to a *principle* thats just making whales and tech billionaires even richer?
fuck that, fuck them fuck bitcoin.
its been crashing for 7 months, and is STILL crashing hard (with no end in sight).
At this point I hope it just goes to nothing.
And some super rich guy (whose already made his pile of money) lecturing the rest of us to stay in for the "principles".
fuck ALL that noise.
BTC sucks, and all its done is cause million of people to lose billions of dollars (all while making some rich silicon valley techies even richer while the rest of us suffer).
Oh, and as for all the tech types that got in early and made money and then now insult and attack those of us who lost money, you are the worst!
You all made your boatloads of money, and then mock the rest of us who lost out.  Those who mock us who lost money are the lowest of the low, the scum of the scum
Bitcoin is a failure, and i can't wait for it to die.  Its a shit system, controlled by whales, crooks and billionaire pump and dumpers.   BTC = total failure, just a tool to take money from those in need, and give it to the ultra elite super-rich.

its had its ups and down when it wasn't worth much
but once it spiked at 20K, people took their money
and the wiser ones looked into it for real
under scrutiny, it was obvious that it was based on nothing
and so the slow decent into nothing begins
all of 2018 has been a crash, with no end in sight
its just down, down, down
where will it stop?
i don't know.
my guess?
maybe about $2000 by end of 2018

don't attack me, attack the billionaires who keep messing with the market, and screwing us regular "forgotten men and women" over.

i never said i was that
i was just someone who invested some money that i could afford to lose, and now...
several months later, BTC has crashed, and is still crashing
so I make a comment that i lost 60% and that BTC is (obviously) in trouble
and what happens?
I get attacked, and told to get out by others
some people rage out if i say that bitcoin is not doing well
I say it politely, and i always admit that I am not an expert, but i am just sharing my opinion
but simply saying that is not acceptable to some
Oh well... I'll just avoid the negative nellies, and stick to those who want to be polite and courteous to each other

bitcoin is set up to make money for the tech billionaires, and the pump and dump billionaires, regular people (even drug dealers) are just there to be screwed over.
if you think that some street drug dealer can outsmart some silicon valley billionaire and their pump and dump schemes, then you are not paying attention to how BTC works.
And it doesnt matter if there is demand or not, if there is no one selling the problem goes away (and who wants to sell, if youre just gonna lose money in selling?)
I mean... its not a perfect plan, but it will put a dent in drug sales, and might even educate the public about what a shakey house of cards this whole bitcoin thing is

i still say that the event holder is a cheap scum if they only provide disgusting toilets with no water.
sure, disgusting toilets that meet the bare minimum requirements might be *legally* all thats required
but if you hold a public event, and only have gross toilets, they I will hate the event and hate those that organized it
i mean... at least germany is better than some places, though.  In the USA city of San francisco the streets and sidewalks are just one giant human toilet, with tens of thousands of "human wastes" being constantly reported on an app.
San francisco people are like animals, just using the sidewalks for toilets, and shooting up drugs in the streets non-stop

someone said "ill never understand why people hate bitcoin?"
I replied:


but anyone who's put money into it in the last 7-8 months, hates that they are losing up to 70% of their hard earned money that they put into bit coin,
and then...
when they say that losing tons of money in bitcoin sucks, they get attacked and told they are just spreading FUD, and also told things like "if you don like it, get the fuck out!". 
so yeah... losing your money sucks, and not being allowed to talk about how it sucks without getting attacked or insulted sucks too. 
So its not BTC, but that sort of thing that people hate
Anyway... banning people who are negative on bitcoin just makes this sub into a circle jerk (which it is not, but will become if ONLY positive bitcoin talk is allowed)
Already, anyone who is critical of bitcoin is piled on, but now people are saying to ban anyone who is negative on bitcoin?
naw, i disagree with that, let free speech reign.
Bt coin is doing really shitty right now, REALLY shitty
will it come back? i hope so, but trying to limit speech to only "happy talk" is not the solution.
I am personally HODLing, and I do not know what the solution is, but I do know that the solution is not to ban people anyone who has something negative to say about bitcoin
we are in a bad bear market, we need to be able to speak freely if there is to be ANY hope of recovery

its crashing
its been crashing for 6 months straight
and its still crashing hard
all those reasons don't overcome the reality that btc is down 70% since last winter
you can try to excuse how were in a crash that shows no signs of ending, but that still doesnt excuse how it is doing so poorly, with no end in sight!
@_date: 2018-07-14 02:48:23


yes i did
bitcoin itself isn't the scam
but there are whales and syndicates that pump and dump, and manipulate the price
so... its a VERY shady marketplace
once people realize what a crooked system it is, they won't want to deal with it (especially with so many people losing so much - basically anyone who bought in late 2017 or all of 2018 has lost money - who wants to deal with that?)
Regular people don't want to deal with such a shady and heavily manipulated marketplace
so, i think the bottom will drop out even more (its already down 70%) until its down to near nothing.  There will be something better, but for the moment, BTC and similar is all we have, and it sucks!
fuck btc
Its just a big money loser, and just because some earlier adopters made money, doesn't mean it doesnt suck now
because.. heres a clue for ya, btc sucks now, and most of us who bought in when it was a "big deal" hate it now, and almost no one new wants to come into a marketplace thats lost 70% of its value in just under 7 months 
@_date: 2018-07-12 20:37:30
just my opinion but people who express the thought that an investment that has lost 70% of its value in the last few months kinda sucks, are hardly "trolls"
I mean, you can agree with them, or not
but I personally think it sucks that I lost most of the money that I put into BTC, and I'm not a troll
I just with there had been MORE people saying BTC at the time I was buying.
If there was more critical comments in the BTC community in late 2017, MANY of us would be a lot better off now (as opposed to what happened, which was the hive mind was saying it could only go up, and many of us fell for it and lost a lot of money)
Sure its our own fault (obviously) but I do know that personally am happy to see many people saying BC sucks, because hopefully it will discourage others from falling for the same thing that got me, and caused me to lose so much money
And its not just me, millions fell for the hype, and lost a lot
We need not just positive BTC talk, but we need to hear the truth about how bad its doing, too. (at least thats my opinion)

yes, a far left opinion website releases info where a guy who hates and has done nothing but attack Trump (and even has left the Republican party because he hates Trump so much) did say that about Trump.  Of course, that a hard core, never-Trumper, establishment swamp dweller says (with NO evidence) that Trump reads Hitler, that doesnt mean its true, or that i believe it.
Granted, every person who cares about history should be aware of what evil socialists like Hitler were saying (so that we can guard against left wing ideas like eugenics and socialism and the dangers of big govt again)
so, I don't care if someone has read Hitler.
But the implication of this article is that Trump likes Hitler, that is a  lie.
(not to mention, there is no proof, this is a pure fakenews story)
Seriously, you can like Trump or not, but actions like this sort of clickbait drivel is true is a bit crazy, no?
this story is because a guy made a claim on a tv show, he got his info from a magazine article that said they got it from a woman, a woman who claims he heard it from some other guy, who said he got it from ivanka.

Look at the issues, and the facts, and then base your opinions on reality
If you do that, you'll see that (even if you're a leftist) as long as if you love America and the American people, that there are many great things that Trump is doing, that all good Americans can support.

How come liberals just seem constitutionally incapable of being happy?
Oh well... I guess thats your problem, not mine.

An asset losing 70% of its value in a little over 6 months is not a natural part of any healthy market
And an asset that has been continuously crashing hard for six months straight is not a part of any healthy market, either
Thats its STILL crashing hard (-$400 just this week) is not a natural part of any healthy market either
I am not saying BTC will never come back (i don't know) but its in a VERY unhealthy and bad condition right now, and there is no sign that this severe drop in value will be letting up any time soon (or ever).
First step is acceptance, and we have to get out of denial and admit that bitcoin is in a death spiral, or in very serious, serious trouble, at the very least.
@_date: 2018-07-13 21:58:05

we can have opinions on famous people and politicians

but what we do NOT do is personally insult or engage in name-calling with fellow members of this subreddit (thats one of the rules here)

@_date: 2018-07-12 19:49:36
i think you are 100% correct
I am smart enough to know that I personally have no idea when that time to re-enter will be
and I also believe that even though I have lost 60% of my BTC value, it will probably go even lower than it is now, and I believe I'll most likely lose more in 2018 (and beyond?)
But, i don't really know when the best time to enter or leave is, so (for now) i'm just trying to educate myself, and also learning the hard lesson to not get caught up in mass hysteria again
I'll HODL for now, learn in the meantime, and either way (as I only invested what i could afford to lose) I'll be ok
It does suck to lose 60% of an investment (and to have lost it in only a few months, and to have that investment STILL being going down EVERY month this year), and I can only blindly ...and perhaps mindlessly, hope that BTC will come back to where it was in late 2017, and hopefully even go higher than that???

bitcoin has lost 70% of its value in less than 7 months, its been crashing every.single.month, for all of 2018 thus far. Its still crashing hard (with no sign of an end in sight).
No matter how you want to look at it, those are all VERY bad things
thats how its doing very bad.
you do understand that just because an asset has gone down, then back up again, is not a guarantee that it will rise again, right?
I am at least smart enough to know that bitcoin crashing even more, is certainly possible.
Those who act like "to the moon" is the only possibility are foolish.

this author is the most economically unaware writers on BTC that i have ever come across
he says "The economic situation is unstable all over the world and it is is in my opinion on the brink of collapse."
In some countries, perhaps, but the American economy is the strongest its been in over 30 years.  The USA economy is not "on the verge of collapse" its hitting historic highs in all areas.
If this guy doesnt know this, then he is truly clueless
Not only that, he also says "The worse the traditional economy gets, the better it is for bitcoin."
Well, as I have pointed out the US economy is doing incredibly, so (by the author's logic) its bad for bitcoin, which is the opposite of his whole point.
Seriously, this author seems to be one of the most clueless writers in bitcoin (and thats saying a lot).
@_date: 2018-07-14 20:21:38
so many idiots, indeed!
this author says at one point, more people than ever are interested and using bitcoin
then a few paragraphs later says what a GREAT time it is to buy, because demand is so low
the reality is that Bitcoin is doing poorly
VERY poorly.
its down 70% in under 7 months (and *still* crashing hard)
no matter how you look at it, thats bad.
That doesnt mean it will never come back (no one can say for sure) but acting like everything is great, or this is just a tiny glitch, and totally normal, and that a rebound is essentially guaranteed, like this author does, is just pure stupidity.

yes, i've seen that video the other thousand or so times its been posted on here,
and investing by meme or comedy video is hardly a good strategy.
yes, we all know when bitcoin was very low in value, it went up and down a bunch, and eventually rose to an ATH in late 2017
and hey.., it *might* rise yet again.
but its also very likely that its reached its highest peak, and it won't come back up again.
i mean... you do understand that just because an asset has gone down, then back up again, is not a guarantee that it will rise again, right?
bitcoin has lost 70% of its value in less than 7 months, its been crashing every.single.month, for all of 2018 thus far.  Its still crashing hard (with no sign of an end in sight).
No matter how you want to look at it, those are all VERY bad things
Will it bounce back?
No one knows, but I am at least smart enough to know that bitcoin crashing even more, perhaps even down to $1-2 thousand is certainly possible.
Those who act like "to the moon" is the *only* possibility are foolish.
@_date: 2018-07-03 19:42:42
well, thats good
I actually am surrounded by nothing but opposing viewpoints
being a Trump supporter in LA, there is no one that shares my politics - at least not publicly.
Here in LA, if i were to wear a Trump hat or shirt, I would get spit on or physically attaked
If i were to put a MAGA sticker on my car, it would get keyed
and working in the film/TV/entertainment business, if i were to be public in my support of Trump, i would be blackballed and rarely/never work in my field again.
So,.. i am sure there are other Trunp supporters among the hundreds of people that I know, but this is LA, so us Trump supporters have to remain in the closet, and coming out could mean that we are physically attacked, or that we have our careers ended.
Anyway, good for you to seek out opposing viewpoints.   Now if you could just learn to be loving and kind towards Trump supporters, then who knows? maybe you could be one of the first liberals ever to start a movement to end the left's seemingly bottomless hatred of MAGA Americans

You'll get attacked for saying a comment like yours, but youre right on point.
Merchants, when they buy products, have about 6 weeks before they have to pay the vendors who sell the products wholesale (in other words, its very RARE for most stores to pay for products when they get them - the only large scale exception is the chain "99cent store").
Meaning... sure, the store can sell something to the general public for bitcoin, but when they go to pay for it 4-6 weeks later the bitcoin could be worth up to 30% less.
So yeah... unless the merchant is ok with the additional accounting hassle of *immediately* converting the bitcoin to fiat, losing value in the time between sale-to-customer and paying for the product could result in losses.
(yes it could go up in value too, but most stores would rather make a slow and steady profit than gamble for more, but risk losing it all - in other words, they tend to be conservative in their financial decisions, not gamblers).
Also there is accounting work that needs to be done and other additional tax accounting paperwork to report for losses and gains in the value of their constantly changing crypto currencies.
As such, its a high risk proposition to accept bitcoin (and in a business with tight profit margins, a big dip could wipe out a business).  Plus, even if value rises and the business does well, its still a lot of extra accounting work, and bureaucratic bookkeeping to deal with an entire new currency (especially since, like it or not, all taxes and costs paid to govt, must be paid for in fiat).
Not to mention, everyone who has the ability to pay in bitcoin, also has the ability to pay in fiat (the reverse is not true).
So other than the novelty of accepting bitcoin (which might appeal to some businesses because its unique or "fun") there is really no good reason to accept bitcoin, and lots of solid reasons to not accept it.

i wonder why you are so perturbed by those who say bitcoin is gonna keep going down hard? (which its been doing ALL of 2018, and shows no sign of even slowing down - in anything, the crash seems to be speeding up)
anyway, no idea why that bothers you so.  I guess we'll never know
but, heres some friendly advice from a fellow member of r/bitcoin
"Be Polite and Friendly, and your experience here on r/bitcoin will be more pleasant for you, and for all of us"
As for selling my"leftover coins"
I have the same number of bitcoins, its just that their value has gone down (you do know how this whole bitcoin thing works, right?)  I haven't sold any yet, and I'll just hold on to them just in case.
Its not THAT much money, so even though I am pretty sure they'll go to zero, at this point, i'll just ride it out and HOLD, just in case it does somehow go up in value again.

you think billionaires aren't communicating and colluding with each other?

yes, but only in the ways the billionaire wants it to be affected (the elites control the MSM).
that you don't know either of those things lets me know the your claim to "know rich people" is total BS.
seriously, if you think the "news" writes stories other than what they are told to write, then you are in serious denial.

it may come back up
it may not
i am wise enough to know *either is possible*
i didn't invest more than i could afford to lose, but then again...
it still sucks to lose 60% of the money i put in, and lost all that in just 7 months!!!

well, who ever holds the market should provide toilets
If you are going to organize a big commercial event, then you should make sure certain basic things are available for the public (toilets would be the first thing on the list)
i mean... i know its common in certain countries to charge, its just a scummy thing to do.
Its like if you bought a ticket to see a rock concert, and youre having a blast, and then you decide to go to the bathroom only to find it costs a dollar.
sure, you're already at the concert, its not that easy find somewhere else to go, so you pay the dollar
but that sort of greedy action is a tacky, dick move, and it ruins the overall experience for everyone that needs to use a toilet.  
so yes... i get it, its common is some places.  I mean, i remember when i was in Morocco there were free bathrooms but they had dudes in there selling toilet paper by the square
Theres always some low life who will try to charge you for any and every thing, but charging for toilets in a public commercial place, is such a greedy, low class, thing to do, that it just makes me hate any place that tries that sort of nonsense.

yes, democrat policies increase unemployment (look at democrat ruled city like detroit or chicago  to see how high unemployment and crime is in those cities)
luckily, unemployment is down now that President Trump is in office.
so sure... many people to struggle under democrat reign (and even under republicans, there will always be some unemployment amongst good people).
i was just referring to those who are chronically unemployed, or constantly on welfare (even though they are able-bodied)
I am 100% fine with helping anyone in true need out, but lazy people and illegal aliens getting welfare from my tax dollars?  i don't like that
not to mention, true story that just happened to me on friday, i was having some blood drawn at a medical testing facility here in LA
it was in a building, right next to a WIC (which is welfare for women and children - which seems like a good thing, right?)
anyway, as i was walking out a pregnant woman walked out of the welfare office, i walked to my car and then saw her get into her car (a late model range rover that sells for about $90K)
wtf? I work full time, and work hard, and i drive a 2016 toyota corolla
and a woman coming out of the welfare office gets into a newer vehicle, that is a luxury SUV
and that sort of thing happens all the time, at least here in LA

we don't personally insult each other.
As for your insulting comment, yes I lost 60% of what I put into bitcoin
but I'll survive just fine, as I only bought what i could afford to lose, I NEVER bought with anybody's credit card (the fees were higher if you bought with a CC) and I only bought BTC with cash I had on hand in bank accounts.
Oh... and I only bought with my own money.
Luckily I kept most of my money is invested in Vanguard, mining that I make about 6% interest (which is WAY better than the minus60% return that bitcoin offers).
so, yes... i lost some money in bitcoin, and I think bitcoin is STILL going down. (in my non-expert opinion, I think bitcoin will keep crashing for the next few years, until it reaches zero, or near-zero, eventually).
But, I will talk about it, WITHOUT having to resort to name calling on here.

but those who rage out like you, and tell people to "get out" just because we won't mindless parrot the "to the moon" and "lambo for sure" nonsense are a real annoyance
you are not in charge of anything, especially not whether i stay or go
you can just sit back down, shut your mouth, think about manners, and when you learn to be polite, than I'll be glad to hear from you (but not before then!)

yes, this is the only true thing about bitcoin that he said
bitcoin sucks, fuck bitcoin, just a bunch of tech billionaires who came up with a way to trick the rest of us into allowing them to take our money
i'll admit it, they got me.  but its still a bunch of rich scums preying off the part of the population most in need.
they offer nothing of real value, and take the fruit of our hard labor, and then call us dumb for not getting in at the right time
"right time"?
the whole thing was set up to collapse the minute enough real people put their money in
when that happened, the billionaire techies took all our money, and crashed the system as they made off
fuck BTC and everyone involved.

convicts overwhelmingly identified with the Democratic Party. Almost 62% of convicts in New York are registered Democrats and only 9% are Republican (similar numbers are true in the other states observed in the study).
The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) looks at unemployment in each state on a monthly basis. Most of the states with the lowest unemployment rates have populations that identify as Republican.

you don't seem to understand that a 70% drop in any commodity is a bad thing
especially since its dropping hard and fast... and still dropping with no signs of relief
since you can't understand that over a several month period that is bad
then i have no choice but to give up, these simple facts appear to be beyond your comprehension.
in fact that you keep saying that bitcoin is "doing fine" is an interesting mix of sad, and funny, and pathetic (so no matter what, you and your comments are entertaining - and a laugh).
and hey... its cool.  economics are not for everyone.
i am sure there are plenty of OTHER things youre good at.
You just keep on thinking whatever you wish (its a free country) and i wish you a good night.
I can't talk to you anymore, because hearing you explain the way you "think" is just becoming a bit too tedious.  
peace and happiness to you, buddy!

if bitcoin is even still around
(personally, I think it will be, although my guess would be that by next year BTC will be worth about 2-4K
...and then be down to $1K by 2020)
but hey, who knows?
we are in a bit of a bounce, so its always possible (although I don't think likely) that bitcoin will continue to go up???
hey... fingers crossed!

i already considered bitcoin
i'm still hodling, but i'm down 60% personally (market overall is down 70% from end of 2017 to now)
its been dropping for nearly 7 months, and is STILL dropping hard
no end in sight.
and hey.... i get it, in the past, it came back from past lows
that doesn't mean that it will again, you know that, right?
i mean...i hope it comes back, but in my inexpert opinion, i don't think it will.
down so much, so quickly, no evidence or reason for it to come back
its a market totally manipulated by whales and crooked tech billionaires,
half the people who loved it before, hate it now
even here, on r/bitcoin (the most pro-bitcoin community ever) look at the comments
i'd say about half the people hate BTC now
and the ones who do like it are just blindly talking nonsense about going to the moon, and lambos
bitcoin is a joke, i don't see it coming back.
but hey... i hope it does, and you never know?

sure, if the store sets up their own BTC payments, from customer to them directly, via lightning
yes, it is cheaper (that part, anyway)
at the moment though, average store owners don't know how to do any of this (let alone how to set up a BTC wallet, or transfer bitcoin back to fiat).
most businesses use 3rd party services.
plus, theres still tax and fluctuating values issues, but until they stop using 3rd party services, it will not even be worth considering for most stores

no thank you
i will HODL what i already have
but i will not be buying any more
i invested as much as i could easily afford to lose, and I will not over-extend myself on an investment thats doing so poorly now
if i lose it all (which is possible) thats cool... i won't be happy, but no big deal, I'll just move on with my life
and since i am keeping what i already have, IF by some miracle it rebounds, thats even better, I'll be super rich.
I don't expect anything, but I invest in a wide range of assets, so no matter what, I'll be fine.
@_date: 2018-07-15 21:32:08
i never bitch
I just point out facts
you seem to be very sensitive, and as such, it might seem (to you) that I'm "bitching"
thats not me.
I'm just pointing out my personal opinion about how poorly bitcoin is doing.
Sadly, that seems to hurt some peoples feeling, Even stranger, people seem to feel a deep need to give me advice, even though I never asked them to.
(I am not sure why, bitcoin is just a thing, people shouldnt have their feelings or identity attached to a concept - Oh well... if you work on yourself, i am sure you will feel better).
I'm rooting for you.

no Americans were involved
all took place under obama
Good news for Trump (which, generally speaking, is good news for America)
This is nothing to do with whether or not someone on here likes Trump, or not (thats anybody's free choice to like the guy or not)
I'm just saying, Trump (once again) being shown to have nothing to do with so-called "russian collusion" is good news, and stabilizing
That it all took place under obama's watch, is bad news for obama and his legacy, but as obama is out of power for good, it doesnt really affect the world economy or international relations
a stable world is good for all investments (except gold, which could go either way if thing are unstable) but this news showing Trump to not be involved is good for the crypto assets markets in general
@_date: 2018-07-13 02:42:45


oh yeah, that was not MY comment
I can't be responsible for what others say on here
I just speak for myself, and share MY opinions
In MY opinion, i think that BTC is in trouble, and very well may never recover
but hey... what do i know? (other than the fact that bitcoin seems to have lost 70% of its value the last few months)
That seems very bad to me, I mean... with my stock investments i tend to make about 6% a year (as opposed to BTC where I just lose *most* of the money i put into it).
I do HOPE bitcoin can magically come back, yet again...
although, past comebacks do NOT guarantee it will happen again
Oh well... I would love to get rich off of bitcoin (who wouldn't?) but the most likely option, in all probability, will be that I will lose even more money.
But hey... you never know?  
@_date: 2018-07-28 02:34:46


I don't have the official figures on this, but that sounds about right
usually people that don't willingly work, are just lazy leaches, and they want socialism and welfare, and money for nothing
on the other hand, Trump voters do tend to work hard, and want to keep most of the money they make (as opposed to giving it away to the lazy people who just want to live off of other people's money)
so, in saying that people who don't work also don't vote for Trump, we seem to be in total agreement!

@_date: 2018-07-15 04:36:41
you do understand that just because an investment has done well in the past
if its plummeting like a rock for 7 months straight, and still plummeting, and has lost 70% of its value, and shows no sign of turning around, and its still going down

i can still store my money or stocks in countless places to, and send anywhere i wish as well
and with my bank, no fees
With my investments with the so-called "evil" banks, i make money every year
but with bitcoin, i have lost 60% of what i put into it
I mean, i am investing in BTC, and I hope it comes back, but this crash is hard, and (in my opinion) it could be the end of BTC (in my opinion, which i admit is not an expert opinion)
@_date: 2018-07-13 04:57:14


although, i do not agree with you that i am "retarded" I do agree that its my own fault,
but more than that, when you say "to believe you would make anything buying it that high" you make MY point
anyone who bought from Nov 2017 onward has no chance of ever making their money back
Bitcoin is crashing, and crashing hard, those who lost big have no chance of making their money back (as even you admit)
it was insanely high, and now (in my opinion) will never be that high again
it was a crazy run, and now that insanity is over, and bitcoin will just linger where it is now, or (more likely) just bear run all the way down to 1-2K (or less)
and as for your comment:


oh really, if i lost 60% of my value, I'm not allowed to share about that?
you're the ruler of who can say what on here?
Oh, i didn't know that!!!
But seriously, I would politely suggest to you, that you need to improve your attitude, I am sorry you're so perturbed by my words!
but using personal insults to insult fellow users on this subreddit is against the rules.  We are supposed to talk about ideas and experiences, but personally insulting each other, and name-calling (hate speech like "retard" or personal insults like "man-baby") is against the rules.
C'mon, dude... follow the rules on here, and enough with the insults and name-calling.
I won't report you this time (the wonderful, hard-working mods don't need to be bothered, they have enough to do), but if you do it again I have no choice but to report you to the mods, as direct name calling and insults ruins the experience on here for everyone!

Trump said *perhaps* we should punish flag burners, maybe.   
i, personally, think that flag burners should not be punished (even though i think they are just a bunch of loser scum, being an ungrateful loser scum isn't illegal, in and of itself, obviously)
so yes, there are issues that I do not agree with President Trump on.
that's true of most Trump supporters (in other words, we are not mindless drones who just blindly agree with the president they like.  Us Trump voters think for ourselves, we like Trump, but we also disagree with him on certain issues while still realizing that hes a good leader overall).
I just wish the leftists could look at Americas leaders with the clarity that Trump supporters have (oh well... wishful thinking).

yes, you nailed it
these types are always working with other manipulators (rich individuals and institutions both)
they are in constant communication with each other, each market manipulation is timed to maximize their returns, and get as much of other peoples money as they can get (by hook or by crook)
they do this with the stock market, too... but much less, as there are so many more rules that (if they get caught doing this) they could wind up in jail.
so these institutions and wealthy individuals are having a field day manipulating the cyrpto assets markets, because there are almost no rules to stop them from insider trading, blatant market manipulation, and colluding to pump and dump in sync with each other and in a pre-planned manner.

but afford it or not, losing 60% of an investment in 6 months still sucks.
as for your condescending attitude, all the tech types and others that got in early and made money and then now insult and attack those of us who lost money, you are the worst!
You all made your boatloads of money, and then mock the rest of us who lost out. Those who mock us who lost money are the lowest of the low, the scum of the scum

Thats just my opinion, and i just said my comment because i don't like to see the good men and women who voted for Trump called names or insulted
Whomever you voted for, I respect your right to share your opinion, and I hope you'll respect the rights of Trump supporters to say they like Trump (when we are called names or insulted)

(Oh "but its not gone until you sell" the mindless BTC lovers will say!  LOL  Nope, thats not how math works, pal.  The value is down for me 60% right now, whether i sell or not).
I'll admit it, i was foolish enough to believe the hype and excitement around BTC and I bought in, without listening to the wiser voices who said it would certainly crash.

yes, you can tweak numbers and come up with any result you want
but your headline said "Why are people so negative about a simple 30% drop?"
people are not negative about a *30% drop*
people are negative because the price dropped from $20,000 to $6500 in under 90 days 
and because it doesnt seem to be bouncing back
Thats not saying it NEVER will bounce back
but to say that people are *negative* about a 30% drop is simply not the case (in regard to what people are negative about).
@_date: 2018-07-12 21:44:57

maybe, will never recover?

sorry to hear that
there was money to be made by early investors

@_date: 2018-04-08 19:41:38
the methodology is seriously flawed.
To be accurate in this sort of thing requires more than simply taking the daily averages, because *not the same amount was traded every day*.  
For example, in late 2017 when price was approaching $20,000 many more people were buying into bitcoin.  Earlier in 2017 when the price was lower, many fewer people were buying/trading, so treating all days as equal is just bad math for this sort of thing.
@_date: 2018-04-09 05:20:34

i tried to explain basic math to OP, but it seems to go over his head
oh well... thanks for posting something smart on here (unlike OP's comment)
@_date: 2018-07-16 03:30:08
this sort of thing is why you should never use products, software or apps that don't have a human being you can actually TALK to
I had a similar issue with a LEDGER wallet.
Only AFTER the problem did i realize that LEDGER does not have any humans that you can talk to
you can email them (I did, repeatedly and yet they never replied, not even once)
They have a general tech support webpage, but it was confusing, not updated, and did not have the answer I needed.
I went to the subreddits the deal with ledger and asked about my problem (I got lots of contradictory answers but none of them worked)
After about 2 weeks of research (hours a day) on all sorts of sites, I was able to figure out the solution.
But wow, what a pain!
The whole time i was thinking "If only these companies that serve bitcoin had real humans that you could talk to in case of a problem, or technical issue, to help their customers out with technical issues"
but they don't.  
When i asked for help or advice on how to deal with my issue here at r/bitcoin I was told (essentially) "get with it old man, being able to talk to a human for tech support is a thing of the past, get into the new way of doing things - If you can't figure it out, then youre just too dumb to be involved with bitcoin".     *New way of doing things*?  If that means not being able to get actual human technical support for products and services when there is a crisis, then no thanks, I'll pass.
But with so many of these issues now, when you have a problem you are forced to just start trying what strangers have said to do online.
I learned my lesson, if an app, wallet or exchange doesnt have some way to allow me to TALK (not email, actually talk) to a human being and get help in case of an emergency, then I will NOT use that product or service
I learned the hard way, but I will never make that mistake again.
Good luck to you !

i agree its annoying when people keep saying silly non-sense thats negative about bitcoin
but you also have to understand, that its also super annoying to the people who have lost money when there are people on here who are saying silly non-factual good news about how its all roses and unicorns with bitcoin
the reality is that no one KNOWS for sure.  bitcoin *could* crash more or even essentially go to zero, or it could go to $1,000,000.  To act like it can only go up, or that HODLing is the only good strategy is foolish.
Personally, I am choosing to HODL, but i only invested what i could afford to lose.  Still, I know I have lost 60% of the money i put into BTC (I started in Nov 2017), and to tell the truth, I am not so sure that I'll ever get it back.
Remember in late 2017, the ONLY opinions expressed were that BTC was going to the moon?  People who were exposed to the one way of thinking, and listened to it, lost a lot of money.  So, just one opinion being expressed has already proven itself to be a bad way of doing things.
I know (for me personally) i want to hear all opinions and ALL points of view, not just the bad ones and not just the good ones.
That way I have the greatest opportunity to be fully informed.

i think it will just go down to $2,000 by the end of 2018
then down to $1000 after that
by 2021 it might come back? or just get worse? but thats too far for anyone to know
@_date: 2018-04-09 05:15:07
its definitely bearish (in my opinion) for at least the next couple of years
(maybe forever???)
@_date: 2018-04-09 05:14:26
Hey, ya never know?

in that case, i am NOT in the Vladamir club
you know what i mean, comrade?

so, don't put in orders for even amounts (like $3500.00)
because computer programs will be putting in orders for $3500.01
theres a work-around, if youre a human, put in orders for $3500.02
you see, if the computer programs can do it, so can we.
@_date: 2018-12-17 18:49:53
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:28:25
it is?
i don't doubt you.
but, i still have much to learn, please explain
@_date: 2018-12-21 17:59:08
since youre specifically asking for a prediction, heres mine.
this recent spike was just a dead cat bounce
it will start to drop sharply, with it down to $1-2K very shortly
I don't pretend to be an expert, or *guarantee* my prediction, but since you asked for a prediction, that's mine!
@_date: 2018-12-21 20:11:14
@_date: 2018-12-17 18:48:24
yes, thats what i am worried about, too.
i have to admit that i still have much to learn, so I am not sure
but when i look at see an 8% bump, seemingly out of the blue, my spidey-sense starts to tingle
and i feel more danger than elation.
I guess we'll just have to wait and see where things go in the days ahead.
@_date: 2018-12-21 20:50:07
you are saying you know what happened to me?
see what i mean?
why do you even care?
why attack me?
I just shared my experience, and you call me a liar.
OK, forget it, you people who insult me win, I won't comment on here any more.  its just such a drag on here, the way some people are just here to attack and insult, and call names (even though youre just guessing what happened, and calling me a liar)
that's it, i'm done.  i'm going back to not even talking on here any more, its too toxic!
@_date: 2018-12-21 19:08:51
yes, and if they are smart, they will build a bot that looks to see what the other bots are buying at, and then make a bot that buys for one penny more than that
you see, the trick it to buy for one penny more than the other bots, that way your bot's order will get processed first!
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:56:17
good point, 
although, i am locked out, and cant even take my money out (or even know what the balance is)
so, hopefully, that money is not gone forever 
@_date: 2018-12-21 19:05:05
yes, as i mentioned earlier, i saw it coming
but like you, i was attacked, called names, personally insulted, accused of being a "paid shill' and yes... even temporarily banned for "being a troll"
All I did was calmly and politely say that i thought bitcoin would go down to $4k or less by the end of 2018 (and then go down to 1-2K after that).
but, now that it has gone down to under $4k (almost exactly as i predicted 10 months ago) I am not here to gloat.  I'm actually sad that bitcoin is doing so poorly.
I am not going to share what i think it will do in 2019 (or in 2020) as I don't feel like getting ttacked or banned again.
But just know, you were not alone, its just that many who did agree with you were bullied into being quiet, or they were outright banned to keep their bearish message from being heard by others.
@_date: 2018-12-19 09:59:13
is that you, bank manager?
i'll never tell!
@_date: 2018-12-21 18:55:20


either that, or the human traders can just see what the trading bots are paying, and then the humans can just pay one penny more than that amount, and beat the bots
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:06:48
oh, good to know
as for me, I just got an email, and they are saying i need to do it again, and i am still waiting
its so lame that they do this sort of nonsense, just allow their own tech support people to fix, instead of making us customers in good standing waste our morning sending new copies of the same IDs over and over.
anyway, thanks for sharing your experience, hopefully it works out
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:32:44
i don't even know what that means.
but hey... i'll bite.
do tell, why have you tagged my username for the last month?
@_date: 2018-12-22 00:14:45
@_date: 2018-12-18 17:01:15
yes, I did show ID when i set up the coinbase account (Over a year ago).
I used my drivers license (since then, I have not moved, license is still active, and nothing has changed, at all)
I have had an account on coinbase over one year, even so...I woke up today to find out i was totally locked out.
I called coinbase tech support, gave them my info on the phone to verify my identity.
they then told me I now have to send my ID to them again (even though I already have an account, and have for a year)
I have to send them my photo ID to verify my identity.  So, after wasting my morning sending them ID and dealing with taking my photo via webcam, I now have to wait (how long? who knows? what a joke they are)
so yes, you are correct in saying "You have to show ID to open a bank account."  but after i have opened a bank account, I don't have to show ID again, just to log in to the bank's website to check my balance!  But, with coinbase, apparently I need to send them my ID again, and I am locked out of even knowing what my balance is, as they look into it.  What a hassle, will never deal with them again.
@_date: 2018-12-21 04:40:35
alex jones and PJW are both a little kooky, but fun, good-hearted guys
as for spencer, not sure who that is, is that the nazi guy?  anyway, nazi means "national socialist" and i cant stand socialists
and alt-right.  LOL  that's a meaningless term, not even sure what one is.
i do know that i support true patriots who love ALL Americans, and who want to be part of making America Great Again.
Fighting for greater love and freedom, and for less corrupt swamp dwellers is the best way to go
@_date: 2018-12-21 20:29:51
see what I mean?
I just shared my actual experience, and I am now getting called a "troll"
this exact sort of thing is why I have made so few comments on here in most of 2018
simply saying my opinion and actual experience makes certain people on here mad to the point that they feel the need to personally insult me.
sometimes, certain people on this sub, make it such a drag to share on here.
@_date: 2018-12-17 18:54:51
always go with the sure thing
@_date: 2018-12-18 07:33:10
and Gavin McInnes, too!!!
@_date: 2018-12-18 07:35:09
yes! Sargon and Gavin ....and Alex should ALL accept BTC
@_date: 2018-12-21 19:00:34
its funny, i actually predicted (in february 2018) that bitcoin would go down to $4000K by the end of 2018
and that bitcoin would go down to $1-2K shortly after that.
Whenever i posted about it on here, I got attacked and called a troll.  I even got temporarily banned on here for saying that.
So, I learned my lesson, and I mostly keep my mouth shut.
But, I was kinda shocked to see your post.  You were also bearish on bitcoin in 2018, and people are actually not attacking you.
I guess people are waking up, and seeing that predicting an accurate downward trend isn't "being a troll" or "spreading FUD"
Its simply one redditor sharing his opinion with others.
Good prediction, sir!
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:34:37
feels good, man.
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:11:49
super helpful.
and what you say totally makes sense
I'm still learning, so I appreciate your insight and wisdom!
@_date: 2018-12-21 18:35:44
socialism is not socialism?
now that's what i can a hardcore NPC talking point
but seriously, have you seen [THIS]( ?
@_date: 2018-12-18 22:48:41


thanks for your wise words.
I won't complain about them any more.
i would do cold storage (i even bought a ledger).  but i couldn't figure it out, and i know if i make the wrong mistake, i could accidentally lose all my bitcoin.
so, rather than risk losing all my bitcoin, because i am not sure how to use a ledger, I had wanted to keep them on coinbase
and yes... three are some people on here who have said to me "youre an idiot, setting up a ledger is easy"  That might be true, i guess i am an idiot (or at least not tech savvy enough to confidently set up a ledger).  So, for people like me who don't know what we are doing, there really isn't much help (other than a bunch of random tech/bitcoin websites with often-contradictory information).
I mean, I know how to use my computer most of the time, but when i have a problem i can always call apple for some expert advice, or take it to a human being at the apple store.  With bitcoin, and with thousands of dollars at stake, its pretty much up to users to figure it out on their own.  I have yet to find a really world community of helpful teacher.
Anyway, not complaining, just explaining why i used coinbase in the first place.  Sadly it seems that I cant figure out ledger, and on the other side of things, coinbase has locked me out of my own account.
@_date: 2018-12-18 22:42:26
even IF i did, over a year ago when i signed up, because i don't have that now means that its ok for them to permanently lock me out of my own account?
I don't think so (its not cool, in my opinion)
@_date: 2018-04-11 20:54:34
not saying they are "priorities"
i'm just showing how almost every aspect of our lives requires an ID
i mean, you cant even rent an apartment, drive a car, work, or even apply for a job,  without an ID
if someone cant do any of those things, then taking care of getting an ID is certainly more important that buying bitcoins
I mean, i think we can all agree on that
you can stop with the snarky attitude there, sparky!
@_date: 2018-12-22 00:12:03


yes, that is true.
@_date: 2018-12-19 02:39:39
that's all fine and good,
but to then make me upload my photo ID, TWICE
and also make me send a selfie, and then make me talk to a customer service rep (and give them all my personal information over the phone), and even after all that, tell me that my only option is to write a message, and hope that someone approves me?
and that it could take some amount of time, but won't say how much time that is?  or even if i will ever be approved or ever have access to my account again.
that's shadyAF
and all while they do this, i cant even have access to my account, or even see whats in there?
that's a terrible way to do business.
I've never heard of any financial company that did such convoluted and shady behaviors!
@_date: 2018-12-21 17:03:46


seriously, you did not know that Nazi stands for "National SOCIALIST party"???
do some research, please.  hitler was a socialist, in favor of BIG govt, banning guns, abortion, higher taxes (tax rates went up to 80% under hitler), and he instituted socialized medicine (in other words, he is exactly the same as socialists are today).
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:31:05
no idea what youre talking about
but hey... if you want to talk
...about bitcoin, go right ahead.
@_date: 2018-12-21 18:03:42


yes, some people do believe that
@_date: 2018-12-21 21:39:18
nope, it will go down that low
this last little bounce was just a dead cat bounce
@_date: 2018-12-21 20:36:16
and in the end, the leftist argument always devolves into anger and personal insults
thanks for living up to the stereotype of the typical leftist [NPC](
and most of all, thanks for the laugh
hilarious! you made my day!
@_date: 2018-12-18 22:53:17
thanks for the input.
and hey... at least there was a place you could go to to get it straightened out
as for me, coinbase locked me out of my account, and say they are "looking into it"
looking into it?  WTF?
hey coinbase! how about you allow me the *privilege* of having access to my own money
@_date: 2018-12-21 22:51:24
@_date: 2018-12-21 21:10:27
i'm gonna keep my mouth shut
whenever i share, i get attacked and insulted on here
i give up
i'm just gonna keep my knowledge/opinions/wisdom/predictions of the future price of bitcoin to myself
@_date: 2018-12-21 22:52:20
hmmm... what do you think?
as for me, if I share anything bearish, I'll get attacked, so I'm gonna keep my mouth shut.  there is too much anger directed at anyone who says bitcoin will go down, and I don't feel like getting attacked.
