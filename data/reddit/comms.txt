I have Bitcoin and I have (a fuckload more) Dogecoin. Dogecoin is more fun.

Same. My father-in-law served and both my wife and I have access to all of their services despite not being in any service.

Their car buying service and fraud protection is pretty incredible too.

Sigh. Have an upvote.

I'm going to go give this a try next time. (Un)fortunately there are, literally, no nearby Walmarts. I live in Portland, they've all been pushed into the outskirts, for better or worse.

Is the ATM there all the time or just during the meetups?
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:34:44
Noted for next time.
@_date: 2013-04-03 05:38:33
Thanks. I feel all futuristic and shit now.

How do you google a word you don't know?
But good work nonetheless, because what this community needs is more smarmy responses to newbie questions.

Awesome. Will explore all of these suggestions the next time. I need to do it the hard way at least once just so I can learn about the process. I now know more about mtgox, vicurex, btc-e and bitinstant due to my adventure today despite my idiotic process.

Here's the thing: If you believe in bitcoin's promise then stop ticker watching because you're investing in BTC's long term future. If you're too anxious then watching that ticker is a terrible idea. If you want reassurance just look at a long term chart. This is the not first dive nor will it be the last but over time BTC trends upwards, just slowly. If you're investing in BTC's future then a dive is an opportunity to get more not sell off your stake.
If you're in BTC for short term gains then, I dunno, panic I guess.

Isn't iOS run a version of Darwin which is unix based?

I just hate it when people like stuff I don't like. No one should be allowed to have a different opinion from me.
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:34:14
This is helpful, thank you. Do I need an account with BoA? Because that's a dealbreaker.

Just FYI, a sizable proportion of homeless people are not employable because of severe mental illness, developmental disorders, significant drug abuse histories, violent abuse, and other traumas. The homelessness is an outward symptom of deep and complex problems that are not financial in origin. Many homeless people are not homeless because they don't have jobs or the opportunity to work but because they are *disabled*.
This is the role that non-profits fill and they *do* need grants and other funding to be able to continue to deliver services because state and local funding is usually far from adequate. Also, non-profits provide vocational training, education, and skills development so that individuals who are not physically or mentally disabled *can* find work.
I'm with you on the guilt thing though. There's no need to feel guilty but being charitable is still a good thing.

This is how I felt a few months ago. Then it slipped my mind. Then I found this subreddit a few days ago, saw the price, and was like, "well, shit." 
@_date: 2013-10-08 01:38:56
I'm not sure if this would improve or worsen the comments.

There should be two axes: one describing the "hardness" of the currency and another to describe the "ease" of making purchases with it. We can call it the "Comms Scale of Transactional Instant Gratification". The scale has two criteria: a) can I buy shit with it *right now* and b) can I buy shit from my couch and have a nice man in a brown uniform bring it to my door?
Here's what the scale will look like:
**Holy Fuckballs, that was easy and I didn't even have to spend my own money**
* Amazon gift cards
* Credit cards
**Still easy as balls but I had to spend my own money:**
* Paypal
* Debit Cards
**On my couch but not everyone accepts this form of payment**
* Dwolla
* Cryptocurrency
**Ugh, I have to go to an actual store:**
* Cash
* Checks
* Debit
* Store gift cards
* Square wallet
* Smartphone based wallet apps
**This will, like, take days**
* transfers
* wires
* money orders
* Western Union
* Canadian coins
**I can't buy anything with this except maybe a bunker and some ARs from those paranoid people on internet forums**
* Gold
* Silver
* MREs
* Land
