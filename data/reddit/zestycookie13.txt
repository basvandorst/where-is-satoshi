Where is it? Anywhere close to the San fernando valley or Sherman Oaks specifically?

thats kinda lame tbh. everyone will sell out at 10/12k. I feel like the cheaper coins have room to grow. You all have low expectations at 10k, thats like 30% increase for new investors, thats your expectation? I'll go with a newer company. Y'all should diversify.

 are u xenophobic? Dumb comment, gtfo hick
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:39:18
Oh god, is this gonna be a sell off like the exchange ban in august? Should  I sell and buy the dip? is a dip coming very soon?

I'm just curious, why is this better than blockfolio or cryptopro?

Sorry, just edited it to say I don't know the password, but would it be one that I created, or would it be a randomly assigned one that I wouldn't remember off the top of my head?

Lmfao.. I'm 20 with a B.M.I somehow lower than my age, 19.. You're not fooling anybody, I know you drive a big truck to compensate for your small chode.. I sure hope you're moving more than crypto than I am, considering the fact that I'm 20.. Also idk why you would assume I'm fat, yet another fact that leads me to believe you are an idiot.. Racist southerner asshole.. Get a life, stop responding 5 minutes after I reply, you loser.. Sorry I don't put much effort into these post's so if i type like im braindead, its cuz i dont give enough of a shit to type perfectly to you, dickweed..

I don't get it.. If the whole world uses bitcoin, won't it be as slow/ slower than it was 2 days ago without a hardfork?
Or is it just to store money, like gold?

Tether is not even worth 1B in total, not even 1% of BTC's market cap, let alone the 240B in crypto market cap. Please stop selling lol
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:06:31
lmao OOOOK buddy. you're absolutely re-re, 100% guaranteed, say no more. Enjoy your turbo diesel truck, and I'll enjoy my V.. You're a racist POS too, I hope you slip in your bathroom or die from a heroin overdose.. It's hard to fathom how dumb you sound saying a 328i is better than a CTS-V, like really? You're either trolling or legitimately have no idea what you're talking about... /facepalm /killyourself . Maybe an M5&gt;CTS-V, but a 328i!?? Seriously? C'mon, get real you idiot. .. You're thinking of mustangs, those are a cheap mans speeding car.. Also Recaro racing seats aren't supposed to be the most comfortable seats..  I'm done wasting time on your retarded ass lol. Deuces b!tch.

haha only use one account at a time I guess, Transfer all the money off coinbase and gdax, brilliant. Don't some banks charge for overdrafts though?
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:21:35
Yeah, but 1 iota is lame. Give her AT LEAST a Giota ;)
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:39:46
Maybe if yall didn't spam bcash is gonna take over, half the people on here wouldn't of sold.. I bought some at 5800, but wtf? Don't act like its the end of BTC and then upvote the crap out of a post titled" heres why i sold all my btc"
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:15:59
hey, bruh you drive luxury cars? cool beans brooo. I have a CTS-V. Luxury sport famalam, beats your lame truck or 328i beamer... You're so g gtfo noob. 420blazeitnoscope360xxxx LEET BRO.  Do I sound educated enough for you now f I don't care to put effort into these posts when I'm just basically here now to call you a sh!thead.. I didn't say that people my age shouldn't be able to speak properly, learn to read man/woman. honestly grow a pair, bragging about "luxury" cars you've got when you didn't even know what I've got. lmao you're the epitome of a jackass. Act like you know me some more... Also up 300% on my alts this month, wtf did you rake in this month, noob? Also isn't your cousin waiting for you in bed?? It's rude to keep a lady waiting.. Also, yes my bmi does mean shit you r3tard, it means i'm not fat... nor obese... You're retarded, end of story.. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:53:52
I would love to see it happen, but if it's at 1,000,000 $, how will people buy? Its already kinda hard for a new investor to join, won't it look idiotic to have a 100$ worth? That'll be like .0001. 
Also what do you guys think will maybe replace money as a currency, what cryptos are good for that? I think it is generally agreed that BTC is now just a store of value, not a daily currency, like BCH may be, no? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:08:10
Oh thats amazing! 30%? I'll continue to enjoy mostly 2x'ing my money on alt coins and losing 20% here and there lmao.. I've doubled my money with 3 different coins in 2 weeks. How has your "digital gold" been for you the past week? Get off your damn high horse, hick.. you're probably from the south (turbodiesel) and malformed due to inbreeding.. And when I said invest in newer companies, that doesn't mean I'm calling BTC a company.. But there are many coins that are part of companies, as far as I'm aware. If you don't think diversifying is at least a decent idea, you should go back to /r investingfordummies. Fvck you for being an  B!tch! I hope you make 30% of your money back :)
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:17:40
Should I buy? Do people think BCH will replace it? Or is this just a good time to buy you think? Ive got 2500 on coinbase waiting to come in, bought at 6900. still want to invest 7.5k more
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:44:52
Does it give reason to expect a December sell off? Is it because of taxs/ balance sheets or something?
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:50:36
Sorry, I don't think I clicked on this page to find out how to look up the events individually.. I'm pretty sure the OP was interested in a singular "place" he could find all the attacks and dips.
This was an attack. Price manipulation has me probably leaving bitcoin tbh, that was lame. ESPECIALLY you redditors acting like it was the end of bitcoin.. I mean one moment you all are so happy and upvoting the sellers of BTC, now check the upvotes, all just BTC holders...
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:58:35
Mmm. And you call me the malformed adult lmao.. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:55:38
price manipulation at its finest. fvck errythinng with bitc in its name
