I use an especially made app which places the order and checks if the order is placed (same for canceling): if it is not placed it starts over again... But it is sad to recur to such tools. Why couldn't Kraken implement a more reliable API? I can understand it may be slow, but that it fails and that you don't even know if your order got through or not, is really unacceptable...

Finally I got Verified Plus. It took half a year and veeery slow answers in the email exchange with the compliance team, but finally it worked.

Same here since at least 5 hours.
I understand they must be overloaded, but not allowing to withdraw BTC saying that the problem is limit / tier level  - which is provably wrong - is a bit absurd and insulting.

OK, I got the withdrawal credited. But where on earth a SEPA is taking so long??? Not workable, CEXio...

I must admit, to their credit, that I never had issues to date with them about bank transfers. Just some delays at the beginning.
But the fact that no user is answering to my original question is a bit suspect. Either they just don't care to answer, or there are not - or there are VERY few - "Verified Plus" users...

Well, this I don't understand... Why should I give here publicly my User ID? instead of you just processing the waiting request sent through the official CexIo support website?

Well, I spoke too soon about bank transfers... The last withdrawals have been disastrously delayed, and one - 10 k€ requested 28 days ago! - is yet to be credited to my bank.
What is going on, CEX???
