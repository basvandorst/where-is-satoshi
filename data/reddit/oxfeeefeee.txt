I believe this was triggered by some influential weibo posts, basically confirming the "second" ban of PBOC.
Edit: adding more info
I typed a lot and chrome crashed, and now I see people get this wrong, I decided I need to type again.
Things are complicated.
To quote from the news post on caixin.com:


 但据财新记者确认，央行《通知》确有其事。只是当时消息传播有误，央行不是禁止比特币平台交易，而是禁止银行为比特币交易平台提供开户、支付、清算等服务。央行当日官方微博有乌龙之嫌，因为即使是央行内部，当时了解这份《通知》存在的人也十分有限。
Too long to translate everything but the gist is: even though the official PBOC weibo denied it, the Notice does exist. The denial was partly because the original report was not accurate, partly because not everyone inside PBOC knew about this.

If you ask me, I don't know what exactly is going on, this is China, where this kind of chaos happens.
The sell off is because the influential guys saying "get out if you want to, I'm here for the long run" implying there is some truth in it.
My personal opinion? there must be something going on, but I don't know what it is. But I'm not going to sell anything. and I sincerely wish the Chinese government does ban BTC completely, and let it grow peacefully in the West. I'm tired of this bad news creator, PBOC is just another Gox, getting it out of the BTC world is the best I can hope for.

Sidechains will do what HTTP did to the internet. it will solve all of the major problems we currently have.
1. The stability of Bitcoin core. with Sidechains we can stop adding new features to Bitcoin it self. there will only be bug fixings, so we don't need to worry some day a fatal bug would kill Bitcoin.
 
2. The size of blockchain. the bitcoin main blockchain will work like the central bank of the bitcoin world, sending tx on the main blockchain could be expensive. At the same time, doing "normal" transactions will still be cheap because they don't get into the main blockchain.
3. The inflation caused by altcoins. Sidechains will kill most of the alt-chains, because they can copy any "feature" alt-chains have and sidechains are backed by bitcoin.

This is misleading.
Voucher deposit is not very popular. Most of people do bank transfer which is still available. 
Don't be so optimistic, there would be a price plunge if bank transfer stops working. But I (or the CEO of Huobi for that matter) really don't know if it will ever happen.

And now ifeng.com posts another article saying the deleted one seems to be  false:

[The news "Stop all bitcoin transactions before April 15th" is false.] some media report "PBC has issued a notice asking to stop all bitcoin transactions", which is a false report. The stance towards bitcoin of PBC was clearly stated in the &lt;Notice&gt; (translator: referencing the well known notice from December last year)
edit: grammar
@_date: 2014-03-31 11:13:06
Real translation:
A further clarification to address your concerns: The notice is from the Central Bank and to 3rd party payment companies. We then received a notification from our 3rd party payment partner, that the deposit channel is to be stopped. Bter has never used bank transfer as a deposit channel, so we do not know the policy of the Central Bank regards bank transfer deposit. We'll make a notice and post on weibo once we know more.
&lt;This sentence is a stupid verse, not going to translate&gt;
So, this is what's going on with Bter:
when most of the exchanges stopped using 3rd party 3rd party payment companies and started to work with banks, Bter did not do that.
Now  3rd party payment companies are finally completely out of the game, Bter, who cannot do bank transfer, has no way to let people deposit.

To be fair, the first time was not poloniex's fault. It was simply a bug in Conterparty's official code, which made it possible to spend anyone's coins (in case you didn't know, a similar bug happened to bitcoin too). I'd say poloniex did a good job by quickly responding to the incident and notifying Conterparty devs.

Shanghai. As far is VPN services are concerned, I don't think it's only about the geographic. Sometimes they do get selectively blocked, based on your location or your ISP, I don't know what's the logic behind it. My broadband works with Astrill most of the time, but my mobile doesn't at the moment.
Even though, most people use VPN instead of Tor.
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:00:49
As a Chinese VPN user, I have to point out that you are completely wrong.
Tor can only give you very limited access of the free internet because it's too slow. Also it's too complicated for average users, and bridges are constantly banned. 
Most people use VPN providers like Astrill or proxies like [shadowsocks]( These solutions works not just for westerners but for everyone including average people like programmers or researchers who has to get outside of the GFW.

EDIT: full story of BTCChina requiring cell number and ID card
When I first use it, I don't need any of those, then when I logged in recently, I was required to setup a "trading password", and then I was trying to set up a trading password, I was required to be "verified", and how to verify you ask? just like how it works with MtGox.

What's so special about  ?
@_date: 2013-10-20 08:50:03
OK, let's talk about both the "Party" and the ordinary people.
For ordinary people, not so much different from the westerners'. Some people is just excited about the idea, and some want to get rich quickly.
But I think people here are more interested in speculations compare to the west, there are historical reasons. 
I remember when I was a kid, my father's salary is about 3USD a month, now after less than 30 years, it's common for people who work for companies like Baidu get payed 5K USD a month or more. Why talking about this? we see people getting rich all the time, and for so long.
This is "the wild west", people see something growing so fast, they jump in before miss the opportunity AGAIN.
Now the government, everyone in China knows the story of how the "Reform and Opening Up" got started, but I don't expect you do.
Before that, farmers have to work in group, they must not own anything otherwise it's capitalism punishable by death penalty. Then there was this experiment that could 
kill those who were involved, let me quote wikipedia here 
"The secret experiment proved very successful. The famous example was that in Xiaogang village, Fengyang county, Anhui province (安徽省凤阳县小岗村), where 18 households signed a contract with local cadres. The cadres secretly allowed farmers to produce by household and if the cadres were punished for this the farmers agree to take care of the families of the cadres.[1][citation needed]. In 1979 similar experiments began in Sichuan and Anhui provinces, both seeing dramatic increases in agricultural productivity. Deng Xiaoping openly praised these experiments in 1980, and the system has been adopted nationwide since 1981."
What does this have to do with bitcion? well, a lot. The news about the stance of Chinese government towards btcion offer get misinterpreted. When they say 
"there is no plan to regulate bitcoin" doesn't mean they won't do it. It means in sort term it's in the gray area, if things go well, the government will probably embrace it.
But if it goes agains the interests of "The Party", people can go to jail because of breaking laws like "illegal fund-raising", like this case 
Just my personal opinion.
@_date: 2013-10-22 12:45:54
I agree with what the researcher said, but please be noted that, it's not "bitcoin-friendly" per se.
It's just, the government likes to let things grow to see if it's beneficial, UNTILL they feel it's against their interest.
Anyway I expect it to be all good in the foreseeable future.
@_date: 2013-10-20 07:08:01

"outlawing" is far too strong, to me they are just saying it's not a "legal tender", implying the CNY is the only "legal tender".
I think some headlines saying "Central bank says bitcoin cannot be used as money" helped somebody get cheap coins.
Edit: I completely agree with "Outlawing pricing in btc for financial institutions and payment institutions."
and I think it's OK to sell stuff for BTC even though it was not mentioned.
@_date: 2013-10-20 07:45:59


To me, equal or less frequently than in the US. anything that involves people getting rich fast is interesting enough for them to write a story to attract audience, but most of them don't understand it quite well.


We should realize that bitcoin is still very young. I don't think the money is big enough to interest the really rich people. I have to say it's just a SMALL group of middle class, tech nerds and libertarians. 
For example I talked about bitcoin everyday, and only one of my colleague is planning to buy.
 &gt; Any businesses popping up taking BTC in your area? If not are there reports of businesses taking BTC anywhere in China yet?
Few, some online business, no physical store that I know of in my city. I think people here are more interested in investing than bitcoin itself.
 &gt; Any official stance on BTC from your government? 
To me, bitcoin is till too small for them to care. But I'm sure there won't be any cracking down in the sort term. In china, the legal system is very immature, and they have a tradition of letting you to do anything, and only come after you when some thing is seriously wrong. 
For example,  if you are a business selling stuff on taobao.com, in theory you should pay tax, but nobody does that, recently the government tried to collect it and failed. In other words, we have gray area everywhere.


Are you kidding, they have Trillions of USD.
