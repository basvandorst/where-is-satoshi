What I mean is, to say it’s low right now, so it’s time to DCA, is a contradiction of the philosophy and math behind a DCA strategy. 
Buy every week or month, or whatever., because you never know what’s low or high. This could be the highest it ever goes again, or the lowest. That’s DCA. Like your 401k, if you’re in the US.
A DCA strategy depends on fluctuations over time for profit, not upward trends.
Edit: took out that last part. You can, but it’s to complicated for this discussion at that point.

There are no cash holders in this scenario. Or no significant amount of them anyway. Most money is digital, so no change to that.
Edit: anyway, it’s just an example of how cash can boost cash, through a sort of monetary algebra, where value is moved from another asset with cash as the means of doing it.

The point of DCA is that you don’t know what’s low or high. It’s a long term strategy.

Sure it can. You just do it by killing the value of another asset.
1 example:
Currency value is hurting?
Print a lot, but don’t circulate it.
Use it to buy a lot of gold in one go.
Use the gold to mint coins.
Introduce gold back into circulation.
Burn the paper money as it’s exchanged back for gold, and don’t print more.

I’m not sure what slow burn means, but a gold holder would lose value in this scenario.

What I’m trying to say is, it’s not something to stop and start at certain times, because the entire point of making DCA buys is because you don’t know what’s low or high. It’s something you continue doing. By all means start now.
If you believe you actually know what’s low and high, you should make all of your buys in lows, and all of tour sells in highs, obviously. As we all know though, that’s easier said than done.

Because legit sites block people trading with addresses that have been flagged, to stay in compliance with draconian money laundering laws.
Essentially, they’re buying drugs, or something else sketchy.
