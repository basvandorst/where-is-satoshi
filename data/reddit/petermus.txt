Why not write down the password and place it into a safety deposit box? You can easily disguise it. Hell. You could write it in a book and simply remember the page.

Actually, the number of divorces is  inflated by a small percentage of people who go through numerous divorces. The world record is currently 25 and one annullment. Naturally, none of his former partners or 40 kids showed up to his funeral.
The number of people reaching their 15th year of marriage is increasing and divorce rates are falling. We could see 60-70% of marriages last in the future.

Gates runs a massive foundation which uses it's reputation to attract partners willing to donate billions. Some are donating to do good and others are looking for positive PR.
Gates adopting a new form of currency with a reputation for illicit usage is bad for bussiness.  
Sure, all fiat currencies are used for the same illicit purposes... But when you mention the Euro people don't say "isn't that what drug dealers and sex traffickers use to pay each other?". I've had people say that to me when I mentioned Bitcoin.
Gates has a reputation to carefully guard... Or he could be subjected to a bunch of hit pieces in the news trying to get traffic.

I think criticism of the system does have some merit.

6K really isn't that big a deal. Hell, there are 1000 other ways to lose that much money being completely responsible.
Sleep on it. Don't sell at the bottom of a crash.
