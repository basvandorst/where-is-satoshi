You can't give 10 people $10 cash each, if you only have $10 to begin with.
Bitcoin in no way prevents people from creating Bitcoin banks, where the bank holds most of your bitcoins (i.e. cash) as a fractional reserve, and you have to withdraw your bitcoins before you can use them. Or even where you can trade bitcoins directly between banks. Instead of bitcoins being the currency, bitcoin-promises (analogous to money in bank accounts) becomes the new currency.

* Suppose there are two blockchains, A and B.
* Either A has more than 49% of the hashrate of B, or B has more than 49% of the hashrate of A, or both.
* If A has &gt;49% of the hashrate of B, then A's mining effort could be redirected to B, and perform a 51% attack with a reasonable probability of succeeding.
* If B has &gt;49% of the hashrate of A, then B's mining effort could be redirected to A, and perform a 51% attack with a reasonable probability of succeeding.
Conclusion: If there are two blockchains, then it's necessarily feasible to use one's resources to attack the other.

So the question isn't about cheaper Bitcoin mining, it's about cheaper heating? Okay.
In that case: You have the option to use a Bitcoin miner, or a heat pump.
A typical heat pump's Coefficient of Performance is supposedly around 3-4. I'll go with 3, to be conservative. That means that for every kWh of electricity, you get 3 kWh of heat. Or, for every kW of heat, you use 1/3 kW of electricity.
For the Bitcoin miners, I'll use the highest Mhash/J value from  - i.e. the best mining hardware you could possibly have right now. That's 1957 Mhash/J, or 7 Phash/kWh.
So, for every kWh of heat, you use 1/3 kWh of electricity with the heat pump, or 1 kWh with the Bitcoin miner (but you get 7 peta-hashes back). So the comparison now becomes: Is 7 PH of mining better than 2/3 kWh of electricity?
The current hashrate is about 340,000 PH/second, or 204,000,000 PH/block (assuming 10 minutes/block). With 7 PH, you can expect to have a 1 in 29,000,000 chance of generating a block. With a block reward of 12.5 bitcoins, that's an average of 42 satoshi per 7 PH, so 42 satoshi per kWh of heat generated.
Is 42 satoshi better than 2/3 of a kWh of electricity? 42 satoshi is currently about US$0.0001. If 42 satoshi bought 2/3 of a kWh, then your electricity would cost $0.00015/kWh.
Conclusion: If electricity is more expensive than US$0.00015/kWh, you should just get a heat pump.

No, I'm not forgetting that x is multiplication.
You're forgetting that the "er" suffix means this measurement is added to the base.
If my old car can go at 50mph, and my new car can go 30mph faster, then my new car can go at 80mph. You just add them together. 30mph is the *difference* between the old and new cars.
If my old computer has 2GB of RAM, and my new computer has 50% more, then my new computer has 3GB of RAM. After converting the percentage to an absolute value (1GB) you add them together. 50% is the *difference* between the old and new computers.
If I have a 40W lightbulb, and I change it with one that's 1.5 times brighter, the new lightbulb is 100W. After converting the "times amount" to an absolute value (60W) you add them together. 1.5 times is the *difference* between the old and new lightbulbs.

If people had to carefully review every drug before taking it, they would take a lot less drugs. I certainly would. Maybe if the drug is good, you clear a minor headache, and if the drug is bad, **you die.** That's not a good risk to take.
This has parallels with a lot of things, even including Bitcoin itself. If people have to carefully maintain their wallet, they will be more averse to using a wallet (and therefore more averse to using Bitcoin). If people need to think a lot to use your user interface, they will not want to use your user interface. If people need to establish a chain of trust to communicate with someone using PGP, they will not want to communicate with that person using PGP.

The core devs can't force anyone to do anything, they can only suggest changes (like anyone else) and change the core client code. If they change the core client in ways that are incompatible with everyone else, nobody will be able to use it. If they change the core client in ways enough people don't like, people will switch to other clients. They have as much power as any client authors and no more.
The recent-ish change to transaction fees was only a change to the *default* transaction fees, so it didn't break compatibility with anything.
Recipients don't need to remind senders to include transaction fees. Why? Because the senders already know that if they know how to use Bitcoin properly. It would be like me offering you a drink, and you reminding me to put it in a container instead of pouring it over your head.
What do you mean by "centralization of miners"? Centralization of miners is a possible problem in the future, but not right now in this discussion about transaction fees. Every miner is free to set their own transaction fee policy, and your transaction will be confirmed by a random miner (with probabilities proportional to their hashing power). In general, the higher the fee you set, the more miners will be willing to confirm your transaction, so the faster it is likely to be confirmed (if the random miner who would have confirmed your transaction in a block decides to reject it instead, then the transaction has to wait for the next block).

If you buy 1 BTC for $600, you have 1 BTC and $1400.
Then, a year passes. BTC is now $451.
You then do one of these:
* You buy something worth $451 using 1 BTC. You now have 0 BTC and $1400.

The linked page seems to be connoting that Git is somehow broken because it's not decentralized.
However, Git's decentralization has a completely different purpose from Bitcoin's decentralization. In the context of Bitcoin, decentralization is good because no single entity can take over the network.
In the context of Git, decentralization is good because most operations don't need to contact any central server, saving time. It also enables more flexible repository structures by not requiring a central server, although this is completely optional and most projects choose to use a central server anyway.
I feel like this kickstarter is missing this distinction, and is about fighting the centralization of Git, when Git's decentralization is optional to start with. If Bitcoin became centralized that would be a problem; if most Git repos are centralized that's not a problem, and projects can still choose to use decentralized Git repos if they want to.

All nodes that haven't updated will ignore the fork because it has invalid blocks.
Mining will continue on the old chain, with whatever miners haven't updated. Blocks will be generated more slowly until the difficulty catches up, which could take months. The new chain will have the same problem.
If some merchants started to accept new-chain bitcoins, then you could effectively spend some of your bitcoins twice - like said. This is *not* a classic double-spend attack - instead, every bitcoin prior to the fork has now split into a new-bitcoin and an old-bitcoin, and you can spend both. New-bitcoins act like any other altcoin.

After 2^(128) hashes there will be a 50% chance that the same hash was ever produced twice.
Chances are both of those hashes didn't meet the target and were immediately discarded, though.
Also, 2^(128) = 2^(80) x 281,474,976,710,656. So if we take all the hashes ever calculated, *and do another 281 trillion times that* we'll reach that 50% chance.

Think about it - if 80% of miners switched from Bitcoin to Litecoin, but all other Bitcoin users stayed, that wouldn't make Litecoin the new Bitcoin.
Also "51%" really means "a lot" - it's not like Bitcoin suddenly switches at that point. In reality, Bitcoin has changed once 95+% of users are using the new system.
But in-between 5% and 95% penetration, there would be a lot of turmoil, which might make change a bad idea even if it would eventually achieve 95% penetration.

Basically yes. You can include the hash of the document as useless data in a Bitcoin transaction.
Hashing is sort of like irreversible encryption. Every time you hash the document, you get the same hash, but there's no way to get the document if you only know the hash, short of testing every possible document until you find the right one (which is called a brute-force attack).
You post the hash of something as useless data in a transaction, and it looks like random data as far as anyone else can tell. Later, you can find that transaction in the block chain, and produce the document, and then the hash proves you the document existed that time. Also, the Bitcoin transaction itself could be used to prove that it was *you* who had the document.

The current mining algorithm can be considered as a family of algorithms, which take a nonce and produce a hash, where the exact function depends on the rest of the block header. Or it can be considered as a single algorithm, which takes both a block header and a nonce.
There's *no difference* between the algorithm and the input - ASICs just hard-wire the part that never changes.
You're probably thinking of something like "use Algorithm 1 if the previous block ends in 0, or Algorithm 2 if the previous block ends in 1". But that whole sentence is itself an algorithm. An ASIC for it would just need two different sets of circuits.

Bitcoin started off as just another experiment, with a few users. Nobody in their right mind would buy bitcoins at that stage. A few people traded goods and services with bitcoins (like the 10000 BTC pizza). And it *slowly* gained users. At that stage, the new users also thought it was an interesting experiment. I remember seeing Bitcoin around 2009-10, and being interested in the idea of mining, but not wanting to waste CPU time or download cap to try it.
Anyway, the userbase grew *exponentially* but *incredibly slowly* (and no, that's not a contradiction). And if something grows slowly, over a long time it still gets very big. This happens to lots of projects. [Jeff Atwood has written about it]( - 
the companies and products that seem like overnight successes actually accumulated users over many years - including Gmail, Twitter, Stack Overflow and Bitcoin.
For your second point - Bitcoin mining - remember that the system tries to fix the rate at which Bitcoins are created. When only one person mined Bitcoin, he received the full 5 BTC/minute on average.

Yes, a randomly chosen uncompressed key is much less likely to be valid - which is why you don't randomly choose uncompressed keys, or try all possible uncompressed keys.
There are 2^257 valid keys of either type, which is the important thing.

No, it won't. The "creating money" effect is not dependent on the particular currency involved.
Let's say I'm a Bitcoin bank. You deposit 1000 mBTC. Now your balance is 1000 mBTC.
I'm a fractional reserve bank with a 20% reserve rate. (Of course you knew this, because I made sure you knew that before you deposited anything, but that's not important right now)
I loan 800 mBTC to Bob. Now Bob's balance with me is 800 mBTC, and your balance with me is 1000 mBTC.
Did I create money? It depends. If you consider "balance" to be money, then yes. If you only consider mBTC to be money, then no, because there's still only 1000 "real" mBTC in the system.
The only reason banks can create money is that bank balance is considered to be money.

That means illegal transactions have some chance of not being properly confirmed (because A didn't confirm them, and A's chain has a chance of winning) and therefore being delayed to a later block (one not mined by A). Which means that on average, legal transactions will be confirmed quicker.

Without any reserve requirement (which seems to be what you mean by "without fractional reserve banking"), a bank can take in a $10 deposit and make $10 in loans (since they now don't have to reserve anything). Those loans are deposited in other banks by the borrowers.
Those banks may then loan out 100% of that money, still $10, into circulation and leave $0 in reserve. Total deposits at this point across all banks is $20, total reserves is $0, total loans are $20.
This can continue for as many layers as you want. It seems even more unstable than before.
I wasn't asking you how FRB creates money. I was asking you how removing the reserve requirement would stop them creating money.

How would you make it so the lowest fee miner gets the highest rewards?
You could have a fixed reward per transaction, but then miners would just spam transactions and reap ridiculous fees.
You could abolish transaction fees entirely from the protocol, and probably make it a constant reward to compensate, then every miner would have to accept that fee structure.
What makes a miner "secure"? What does that even mean?

They're the ASCII characters "end of text", "vertical tab" and "form feed", which are control characters and are not printable in ASCII.
Since they're rarely used as control characters, some terminals display printable characters for them instead. This is a terminal-specific thing you can't rely on. It's likely a holdover from DOS.
On the Windows console it only shows the heart: 
On PuTTY, it prints "ASCII test: ", clears the screen and prints a blank line. (more similar to intended meaning of the control characters).
In Scintilla it displays codes for the control characters:

A 75% activation threshold does seem a bit low, when usual thresholds are around 90%. But I wouldn't say it's too low to be a consensus. And *any* activation threshold less than 100% guarantees there will be two chains.
Previous forks have only been able to use 90% thresholds because it was expected that most miners would vote for the fork just by updating their software; this one requires a conscious switch. Even if 100% of Bitcoin users supported increasing the block size, getting a 90% threshold would be difficult simply because some of them won't be aware they can vote, and the core developers won't be making that decision for them.
I expect a lot of the 25% will be people who either don't know or don't care about the block size debate, but will still switch over when they realize they're on a minority chain. That will boost the forked chain's share fairly quickly.

I could vote for 5000MB, but it wouldn't move the mean very much. You're probably thinking of this.
Or I could vote for 299705MB. Out of my 21% hashrate share, 20% of that gets discarded. Out of the middle 60%, we have 59% voting for 5MB, and 1% voting for 299705MB, which works out to a 5000MB average.

So basically, you suggest declaring war. Right now, XT will fork if people want it to, and it won't if they don't. You are trying to make it so that even if most people want it to fork, it won't - that is *actively blocking consensus* (and decentralization of decision making).
This kind of thing could easily destroy Bitcoin, and I don't mean BIP 101.

Burning all bitcoins would require all bitcoin holders to agree, by burning their bitcoins individually.
@_date: 2015-07-26 04:40:20
Let me summarize how proof-of-burn works:
* Someone creates an alternative virtual asset system. (Call them XYZ-coins for example).
* They set up their system to recognize when someone has destroyed bitcoins in a particular way (proof-of-burn), and grant them the same number of XYZ-coins.
* Now random people can burn, say, 1 bitcoin, and get 1 XYZ-coin in return.
It accomplishes the goal of seeding the market, because even if no XYZ-coins exist yet, they can be created.
It accomplishes the side effect of setting a maximum value, because:
* Suppose 1 XYZ-coin was worth more than 1 bitcoin (in USD or whatever other currency). For the sake of argument, say an XYZ-coin is $310 and a bitcoin is $300.
* If I have $300 to spare, I can buy a bitcoin, convert it to XYZ-coin, then sell the XYZ-coin, making a profit of $10. In the process, Bitcoin's value goes up (more buyers) and XYZ-coin's value goes down (more sellers).

Why would that be a problem, as long as the inflation is at a known fixed rate?
Also, eventually it will cancel out the effects of lost coins, and average zero inflation or deflation. The current system can only deflate, and will always deflate once block rewards are low enough.

Nobody is going to get any transactions done because they'll be ignoring all the blocks. Say you have 80% of hash-power mining XT, and 20% mining pre-XT. On the pre-XT chain, it now takes 50 minutes on average to get one confirmation, and 5 hours to get 6 confirmations. That's an incentive for more users to switch to XT. And if users switch to XT, then pre-XT miners will find their rewards are worthless, which is an incentive for them to switch too.
Pre-XT blocks will also all be full (because there won't be very many), further delaying transactions on the pre-XT network.

Unfortunately you'll never get 75% of Bitcoin users making their own analysis (much less 90% for some BIPs). Which means if persuading people to your side was banned, then no change would ever happen.
As for releasing binaries, that's a similar problem - you need to make it as easy as possible, or people simply won't bother.
Imagine a world where 0.01% of people were against some change, 9.99% of people were for it, and 90% of people simply didn't care and used whatever's convenient. Nothing ever gets changed... unless you set ridiculously low thresholds like 7.5%, in which case all your changes still fail because there isn't mining consensus.

Again, why does it matter? If units are arbitrarily divisible, what's the difference between paying 2000 units (equivalent to $2 each) and paying 20 units (equivalent to $200 each)?






With 200000 BTC worth $2 each.


Couldn't find the size of that with a quick search, but Ukraine apparently owes Russia $2.5bn for gas. So, with 1250000000 BTC\* worth $2 each, duh.


I'll assume this is a similar value to the above, so see above.
\* If there aren't this many BTC in existence yet, but people are making transactions this large, then the price is higher than $2. Since the price is $2 we can assume this many BTC exist.

Yes. They could:

* Block you from using Bitcoin altogether.
The system doesn't rely on real-time communication, so it's conceivable that you could work around it by, for example, mailing encrypted USB drives.
Also, if they ever add encryption to the protocol, it will be difficult to distinguish an encrypted Bitcoin connection from any other encrypted connection... although it will be possible (for example, by correlating bandwidth with the timing of new blocks)

Let's say we delete transactions leading to empty addresses from the blockchain.
Now, say you're starting up a new Bitcoin node. Your node connects to mine for its initial download. My node sends you a blockchain containing a transaction "address 1 sent 100 bitcoins to address 2", but no other transactions involving address 1.
How is your node going to tell whether address 1 actually received/mined those bitcoins (and then had its records deleted because it had no more bitcoins), or whether my node just pulled that transaction out of thin air?

A theory I've heard quite commonly in is that in that case, nodes and users will refuse to switch to the new fork. All that would happen then is that a majority of miners will be on a fork that nobody's using, earning block rewards that nobody will buy.
Or in other words, miners are required for the fork to automatically activate, but if it doesn't have node support as well, then the proposal will just fizzle out (as a majority of nodes refuse to propagate the fork's blocks).
Also, a majority of miners can already do bad things - like DoSing all of Bitcoin by refusing to process any transactions (and not mining on top of blocks containing non-coinbase transactions).

* Have a flag on the output that says "this is a mining fee output". Such outputs are unspendable normally - any transaction using one as an input is invalid. Their sum can be added to the amount of the coinbase output, like usual. If sum(inputs) != sum(outputs) for any transaction, that transaction is invalid.
Or, even simpler:
* Have a "mining fee" field in the transaction header. If mining_fee != sum(outputs) - sum(inputs), the transaction is invalid.

Bitcoin transactions have inputs and outputs. The difference between the total inputs and total outputs is the fee. So if a transaction has one 18BTC input and one 14BTC output, the fee is 4BTC.
