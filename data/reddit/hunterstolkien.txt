You really think that the US isn't going to destroy the value of the dollar in the next ten years via QE and inflation?  
I'm going gold over treasury bonds no matter the amount. Entitlements and endless war are to the point where our debt is going to outstrip our income in the next 30 years.  
The USD is headed for stagflation and there's nobody at the reins who can be trusted. Ron Paul was our biggest hope. We're fucked and as the USD decreases in value, more people are going to be putting their money in gold, which will further increase it's value.  
Regardless of the value, I'm going gold, Bitcoin, treasury bonds, USD.

What a stupid, bad faith, straw man thing to say.

They cut up that interview so bad, and 30 seconds on Google will find you a video on which he is able to clarify what he meant without it being chopped up by Vice.  
The crux of his argument was that makeup imitates sexual arousal (flushed cheeks, red lips, etc are common in sexual arousal) and that the reptilian portion of the male brain interprets those visual cues accordingly. Since some men are immoral, they will take those cues to sexually harass women.  
Peterson does not condone sexual harassment and even in that interview has said that he thinks sexual harassment should stop, so it's not like anybody can misinterpret unless they are deliberately doing so, as you have done.
