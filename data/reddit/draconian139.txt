To me he seemed to be very hopeful for bitcoin but was concerned about there being potential oversights.  I mean, "I really should provide a fleshed out version of your
proposal, rather than nagging you to fill out the blind
spots." definitely indicates that he was favorable.
All that he had to go off of at the time was the white paper and with that limited amount of information being skeptical was completely sensible.  After Satoshi mentioned that he sent him the source I didn't see any further nitpicking about the details, so I'd bet that he was a very early adopter.

They both fall for the media smear campaign against the other, which is amusing since they're so fast to point it out when its done to them.  I largely sympathize with OWS but don't participate as I find their methods completely ineffective due to their lack of focus.  I do participate with Wolf-PAC which has a much narrower focus and embraces conservatives and liberals alike. 
For those not in the know Wolf-PAC's goal is to get a 28th amendment passed to end corporate personhood and publically finance all elections thus greatly reducing the influence of lobbyists.  Since we believe that Congess is too partisan and corrupt to ever pass such an amendment we focus on the state level and strive for a convention of the states as outlined in Article V of the Constitution.

Buying through a traditional IRA would make bitcoin purchases a tax deduction lowering your taxable income.  As you said with a ROTH when you sold it would not be taxable.  
The government will not ban bitcoin at this point, I'm pretty confident in that considering the sale to Draper.  Also rules on ROTH IRAs definitely won't change as that would effect far too many people, including everyone who finances the politicians' political careers.

I'm going to assume that you're American here as I don't have a clue about tax regulations in other countries.
It would be a bit of a pain, the IRS treats bitcoin as property, not currency.  So you must keep track of the fair market value of bitcoin for each date that you receive payment and how much bitcoin for each date to calculate how much you were paid in terms of $.  You then would have regular income and sales tax to deal with based on that amount.
If you later convert it to $ you can then claim a capital loss or gain depending on sale price, note that there are favorable tax treatments on property you've had for longer than a year so you're best off employing a FIFO system of keeping track of what bitcoin you convert and making sure that you've had at least that amount of bitcoin for over a year out of your remaining bitcoin.

I'm assuming that you're wanting to make a distinction for tax purposes as I can't come up with any other reason.  If this is the case the IRS guidance on investments where a distinction cannot be made is that you have to use a first in, first out method.  So if you sell/send a bitcoin your basis would be that of the cost of the oldest bitcoin you bought.

Taxes are not included in most transactions.
You owe income tax as well as selfemployment taxes on bitcoins you mine based on the value of them when you mined them so keep accurate records whenever you successfully mine any.
You owe capital gains tax on the amount that they have appreciated by when you sell them.  Depending on your tax bracket it may be advisable to hold them for at least a year as the maximum bracket for longterm capital gains is 15%.
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:16:48
This is true but I'm not sure if it matters.  People talk about bitcoins in terms of whole bitcoins, people talk about gold in terms of ounces, the general perception will be that bitcoins are worth more than gold.  Yes, people that take more than ten seconds to look at a story will realize that this isn't the case but short headlines and sound bites are what tend to stick for the majority.  I'm with the OP that it could be a major psychological step.

You will still need to provide your basis even if you cannot substantiate it.  Generally the IRS will give the benefit of the doubt when you're voluntarily reporting something that they aren't getting a record of from any other source unless someone's just doing it to qualify for EIC.

Hold for at least a year as longterm capital gains are taxed at a lower rate.  If you do this unless you made over ~$35,000 gain(add in any other income you have to this) you won't owe taxes.  You would still technically be required to file if you were under this but the IRS is unlikely to come after you since you wouldn't owe them anyways.

Whenever anyone starts shouting advice at you that's unsolicited, i.e. you didn't bring up bitcoins yourself, tell them that you're interested in their opinions and curious as to what their ROI has been like over the past few years.  In my experience the majority of people that will badger people about selling any form of investment either don't invest at all themselves or go through a broker that handles all decisions for them.

The problem is that with many of the sites with high prices its not possible to actually liquidate.

If they cash out immediately it doesn't matter to the merchant at all.  Most are charging their prices in $, and allowing the buyer to use an equivalent amount of BTC instead.  They'll still receive the same amount of $ regardless of what exchange they use, it does affect the purchaser who should be aware of their own platform's current exchange rate to determine if its a price they're willing to pay.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:48:46
Yes, you need to do so.  Its possible that you could value the bitcoins at the most recent price instead of the oldest price you bought them at though.  The IRS has yet to release clear guidance on this.
My plan is to report what I made direct purchases with at the most recent price that I bought bitcoins at with the argument that I bought that part of them specifically for the purchase, which is true.  Worst case is that I get audited but I won't have to pay a fee as it will be clear that I'm attempting to report in good faith.

It still makes sense to do this with merchants who offer a discount compared to places where you pay in fiat.  Example: a merchant is selling for 2% lower than anywhere else I can find the item, its still beneficial for me to buy coins, pay the transaction fee, and immediately purchase the item with bitcoins.

"If I could own bitcoin, I would."  The article says that the reason he can't is because its not on an exchange.

There's two ways of looking at this, one is that you aren't paying the bank anything currently.  The other, which I feel is more accurate, is that you're paying whatever % inflation is higher than your interest rate by.  
Expecting banks to offer services for free when it comes to bitcoins is a bit ridiculous in my opinion.  Since the dollar's inflationary its very easy for banks to have a highly diversified portfolio and at the very least match inflation, which is how they make their money.  It would be far more difficult to use this model with bitcoins.

If you wish to file the taxes correctly you need to record the value that they have when you first mine some.  This amount is taxed as normal income.  Any realized gains from converting them into USD are then claimed as capital gains.  
Edit:To clarify you should record the value that the bitcoins have each time you mine some and the amount you mined at this value,  not simply the value of the first ones you mine.
