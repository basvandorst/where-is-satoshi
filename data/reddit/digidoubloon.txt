Local councils here in the UK fomo'd into sub prime.
The credit crunch here happened because the collateral banks used for loans between banks was stuffed full of worthless financial instruments. So no bank wanted to show that there books were full of the stuff.
I'm sure many more countries did the same.
We're still only paying off the interest not the principal of that f up now.

My advice would be treat the 1btc like a pension and forget about it.
Unless it fails it will continue its trajectory to Jaw droppingly awesome. The stuff inbetween is the human race coming to terms with it. This will take some time and will continue to be volatile. 
Try trading on paper first with no cash. Alts will always go up and down so there is no rush.
Don't FOMO. You will but try not too.
Don't sell if underwater. We still have pumps from crypto conferences to come for a couple of years at least before the chaff becomes apparent.

That was a great read. 
So are all your later comments. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:00:48
lol, very true.
That would require a half decent job though yes? So I don't know how anybody could do that.
I agree I fluked it with btc in that I didn't really understand at first that it was one answer to something that bugs me a bit, but I don't think this is over by a long shot.
I'm not looking at 30+ year as I would have been retired for a while by then, although I'm planning on passing some of this fluke on to my offspring.
I'm looking at 10 years or holding to retirement but I think by then bitcoin would have proved itself to be the most awesome thing or it would have failed. 
Anybody can chuck a little into bitcoin and watch that small amount grow. The trick is time in the market. Actually going along for the ride on what seems to be an unstoppable thing.
Gains like mine are typical for bitcoin over a long period of time. This is still true today. People just can't get there head around it because they don't understand it. Hardly anybody knows what a synthetic cdo is either so they can't see the true value of bitcoin because they have no faith in the idea because they don't really know why we have faith. Or at least the people that run a full node have faith.
I don't really think bitcoin is an investment. It is a statement. That statement expressed globally has value which far exceeds your 401k.
That statement is long term, forever. I'm not going to stop using it. In 30+ years your crypto will be more than your 401k if you put the same amount in if it survives.
Risky yes. Any time you want to remove that jack boot off your neck you will incur much risk. 
Edit. After those 10 years I don't really want to convert it. I just want to exchange it for goods and services. Maybe an island lol.
 
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:59:46
I explained hashing.
Then hashing to find a hash with x number of zeros.
Then transactions in a block with a hashed header like a safe within a safe within a safe within a safe.
The network doing the same amount of hashes as grains of sand.
Then the dyson sphere for a sense of how big the numbers are.
Took a few days. After that filling in the blanks and expanding her knowledge on a daily basis.
Her name for it is steady eddie.
I assume you can lose the cash. Put a percentage of savings in it. If you can get one whole bitcoin that would be sweet. Or one each. 
If you have kids or are thinking of it go down that route, that it's for the future, not short term thing.
Start with hashing.

I think it will be necessary at some point if bitcoin continues absorbing fiat and more people use it. I'm sure it will become apparent when the time comes though.

If it's your first job don't worry you have plenty of time to make more cash if it fails. It won't because they're are awesome people with a moral compass behind it. That's the value in it. Maybe save a little in cash too or diversify into something other than crypto.

Core must do what they do. Develop bitcoin to be permissionless for many participants until it can be developed no more.
If that means bumps in the road that's fine because in the end that will be the chain that has value over all others.
The time will come when a blocksize increase maybe necessary. That time isn't when business says so as they are a third party.
It is when the the peers say in conjunction with developers.
That will make the best p2p currency.

I know that feeling dude. I flipped a fair chunk of bitcoin to litecoin on the segwit drama. This went sweet.
Then I went crazy gambling and bet shocking amounts on random shit.
I fell in love with stratis then. I still like the idea now.
At the same time I realised I was throwing Bitcoins, the only thing people really use on shit. I stopped but by then stratis had gone up and then down HaHa!
Still have healthy litecoins. I like the trinity of btc/ltc/vtc. Vertcoin is still healthy. For how long though?
Stratis sucks so bad but I still love the idea. Tumbling Bitcoins. Tumbling the trinity.
There should come a time when money from Bitcoins pumps the alts again otherwise I've lost so much more than I care to mention on strat. And doubled down lol. I will again if it loses half it's value. Tumbling Bitcoins will be an actual industry in the future. Is an important thing. Shame they're too snooty or something to think perception matters.
On the bright side I have bitcoin and will keep these until I can retire earlier than I could without them.
I also cross my fingers for my alts. Know a decent religion?

Maybe it's just humans acting like humans around a technology that is evolving into something. It isn't even at version 1.0 yet. It is a social experiment and hasn't got to the point of full saturation across the globe. 
When it has we can look back and see the evolution. Whatever that maybe. At the moment it is a hash in time. When enough time has past it will be easy to verify. Time is the hash function. We are not quantum computers.

This is where we started. I'm still at a loss how anybody would know. If you bought from coinbase etc yes you have a paper trail.

Yes if you tried to play a fast one you're asking for trouble if you wanted to suddenly buy a lambo. I'll agree with you there.
Haha, yes I lost that kilo of gold but years later while out with my metal detector.. 
Back to the original point. You never own land but you do own a bitcoin, unless it was bought in the government structure.There is freedom there.
I'm happy to pay taxes if bitcoin survives the next decade or earlier depending on how this goes. Hopefully in bitcoin.

Check your log book. It says keeper not owner.
To register is to be keeper not owner.
Funny that as you register your child's birth.
Acts of Parliament. It's there in the words. Acting. Pretend. But we play the part of the person. The fictitious character in capitals.
An act of parliament is given the force of law by consent of the governed.
Isn't real. Until they take your land, car or child. Then it is because you signed your name and played your part.
Is a mind game created by your owners. George Carlin figured it out too.
Bitcoin plays a new game. Unless you give somebody your private key.
That is what is so awesome about it.
You really do own it. Nobody can take it away. 
Unless your bitcoin are in a company that resides in the law of government.
Then you own nothing.

Nobody bothered to find out why the housing market failed.
If they did they would have heard Bush say "we have made this home loan fund for people who can't afford a mortgage to get a mortgage".
That is a set up because if you can't afford a mortgage chances are you're not gonna keep up payments because you can't afford a mortgage ffs!
Nobody looked into mers or the liability of fanny may and freddie mac, linda green etc. Nobody bothered.
So why would they have faith in bitcoin?

Consumerism is a waste of that resource. When the day comes that no more cars drive through London and we are back to the horse and cart people will call us wasteful c u next tuesdays.
That is what is fluff or what I would call sad.
That is what I meant when i said Is that the standard you are referring to?
Edit. Food for everyone? Wtf?

Utopia is Greek meaning no where, will never happen. If bitcoin really took off and businesses paid salary in bitcoin in the end it would be a requirement that the salary be paid as a smart contract that pays all taxes etc.
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:03:28
How would they know you had any?
How could they prove it?
I can choose to prove or not prove it.
I may have no bitcoin or many. I'm just philosophising on the internet. There is freedom here if you can find it and keep it. 
Much like what that President said about the republic.
Edit. I just realised you said bank. HaHa! That was really funny. Bank lol.

Thanks man! I just realised you're British :)

Reading that makes it less ambiguous. You never owned jack.
I think I need to read more and that a few more times. That was hardcore.
We have it better now. I'm guessing that's because there are so many of us. Can't go bopping everybody on the head these days.
Imagine generations living in their castle watching the great unwashed breed like rats. Wow. Gotta cut them some slack.
There is more reason in it now I suppose. My land can still be compulsory purchased by the government so it's still never mine is it?
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:24:20
That was ace!
I never knew.. I never thought I'd want to watch telly again..

Imagine taking that couple of hundred and going out for the night.
You wake up a little worse for wear and the couple of hundred is gone.
Now imagine keeping the couple of hundred and researching solidly for a week.
You now have knowledge and a couple of hundred.
Now with that knowledge do you go out and come back with nothing or, do you buy bitcoin and just keep it forever while following the success or failure of bitcoin?
Going out you get dehydrated. Buying Bitcoin you don't get dehydrated and maybe when you retire you have a golden goose.
Anything else would be false expectation.

Thank you. I'll shall read it tonight.
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:58:32
Exactly. Why don't this cabal try to bring new functionality and progress btc rather than overthrow the peer reviewed  process of upgrading.
Especially as they/he keeps fucking it up!
@_date: 2017-10-09 12:07:43
I have found that there is an army of fudsters trying to coerce bitcoin. Sometimes they are tricky, other times obvious.
The more people talk the better. Great time to be here as this latest attempt to change bitcoin will fail so spectacularly and publicly that it will be a joy to watch.

What's wrong with hitting the G spot?
Plenty of naughty grannies out there son.
Plus, get the there, they're, their thing mate you're letting the side down.
It's like a bad meme. We're trying to shill this to institutions ffs.

Satoshi's vision is consensus which you dear seemingly don't understand.

One of us!
I love it when a true bitcoiner starts up in the comments.
@_date: 2017-05-28 12:59:52
You bought a golden goose.
Never forget that.
Unless it fails but that is the risk. Not todays price. Price in years to come.
That is the bet. 
Good luck!  
@_date: 2017-05-27 02:18:40
This guy.
I've seen this graph a few times now.
Had the same conversation at different price levels.
Have the conversation it drops and don't have the conversation.
It becomes news and I have the conversation again.
Sell the news. Bitcoin chugs along..
Bitcoin is people. As long as they continue I will have the conversation again.
In the end everything ends. But this has just begun. We are at first sell off.
Cheap coins says graph.
Network needs to grow to support new bag holders to follow graph. If it does then mega pump is go for launch. It is inevitable because of greed I think.
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:22:44
We will be at start of graph again soon which is time to buy.
I haven't bought for years but will buy this dip as has chance to grow the most and never return to that price again.
@_date: 2018-04-11 23:28:08
As long as geeks keep typing.
Bitcoin will keep pounding the history books.
The rest is poppycock.
Love you geeks. F'em all.
Keep typing.
@_date: 2017-05-27 09:42:34
We are at first sell off.
If you zoom in first sell off looks like this graph.
Proper dump is not for a while. Price will be around $8 - $9k
That will be brutal.
@_date: 2017-07-03 09:52:47
Love it. This is why I love bitcoin.

If this math puzzle intertwines with society.
Is that a dream?

That's so sad.
@_date: 2017-07-05 11:03:41
That made me laugh thanks for that.
@_date: 2017-07-06 12:48:35
As payment system maybe. Bitcoin is rare hard to find thing though. The proof of work has been done. This is what makes it the best rare thing.
Bitcoin is crazy math puzzle and the blockchain is the answer that is constantly getting longer with more proof of work.
Nobody can beat that.
Humans cannot resist extending the math puzzle. Is not really payment system. Can fork or whatever, math puzzle will remain.
Because of all the work that has been done. 
Litcoin is way behind being the longest chain with most proof of work.
@_date: 2017-05-27 19:12:15
Go long.
Worked for me. I've seen that graph a few times now.

What happens when btc gets excepted and people get paid in btc and  tax is enforced through smart contracts?
@_date: 2017-06-10 23:25:28
Plenty of unregulated exchanges around though. I like the guy and if he did is fine by me.

Not that many. There is a post from him somewhere. I'm sure lately he did some insider trading no doubt though.
@_date: 2017-06-10 22:49:31
I don't think that was ever the goal. A crypto secured greed machine was the goal.
Game theory. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 22:36:09
A person so much more intelligent than me said to me years ago bitcoin is scam. If you look at the people in it.
I never knew what he meant and he never explained himself.
Originally bitcoin was freedom fighting middle finger money (allegedly). Everything else is just trying to make money is the vibe I think.
I think this to a degree but also know I'm full of shit.

Thanks for the replies.
I was planning on leaving it out of the way of the gremlins on a shelf but I checked the CPU and it is way too slow. Is 350 lol.
Is old windows 7 netbook. To be fair was always slow as. The misses used it for gossip.
Is a shame nobody makes a little stand alone box. I did see one but review was a bit bad.
I think this coming year Bitcoin could do with more nodes. 
I was going to copy the blockchain from my pc onto hd then see if it would figure it out.
Any ideas?
I'm willing to buy something if I can pay with BTC. Put these gains to good use.
I think everybody should. I would like to help this thing live as is a thing of wonder.
Thanks again for replies peeps!
