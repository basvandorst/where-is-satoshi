Our plans are as far follows: 
Create own coin. 
Find a way to extract more fees 
Slow down the network withdrawal process an extra day so we can commingle funds and trade. 
Segwit in production is not helping us profit more  so more testing is needed.

I believe the winner will hold and not cash out. Keep in mind these investors  don’t want capital gains taxes and if they have the money to buy these coins they probably don’t need to sell. You would feel it if the government unloaded them at market value but they won’t do it. They love leaving money on the table. Maybe Tim Draper will come back for more action. 
In 2014 
June 30, 2014: 30,000 bitcoins sold at a value of $19.4 million (price per coin: $647)
Position would be worth $71.9 million - net profit $52.5 million
Buyer: Venture capitalist Timothy Draper

Congrats but give yourself some credit dude. If crypto implodes I’m sure you will be a better teacher than if it explodes. The most meaningful lessons of life come from failures. Few learn by succeeding. Pretty sure your son will be teaching you a thing or two as over the next few weeks months years.

I agree with this statement, but now that you have spilled the beans about your sister, give us some details on how your relationship with your sis has changed because of your crypto wealth.

The only comparison that matters is right here:   
Let’s assume the demographics are the same ;)

No they are that high. Just did a test to compare the two coins. I was blown away and lost the bet. 
Store in value needs a secondary use case to be successful long term. This is just how it works but people are treating btc like shares. Bitcoin was designed to use from consumer to merchant for anything. You cannot buy a $30 item or whatever with btc anymore. The block sizes are too big. People seem to be forgetting thAt but btc was a utility. It’s no longer “decentralized” because you have can’t do much without a financial exchange. More will become clear over the next few months. The funny thing is the bitcoin cash seems to mimic the original white paper better than btc. 
I have no dog in this race. I am not taking sides to take sides. I think these augments are dumb and uneducated. However, I think bitcoin cash is going to win in due time unless btc gets fixed. They have too many bottlenecks. BTC was not designed for rapid adoption and $17k value per coin and crazy mind blowing fees. Fees and decentralization don’t go together.  It grew too fast and none of this thought about. 
I don’t know what the future holds for bitcoin but I’m pretty sure bitcoin needs to cut politics and get to work. Fees suck. Slow speeds suck. Legacy architecture sucks. 
Good luck.

Early 2012, I bought I made a purchase on a marketplace that no longer exist. Since then I haven’t touched. They sit in cold storage in rented safe lock boxes at my local banking institutions. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:34:43
More or less. go try it. you will be shocked.  Send to a friend and see what happens. It ain't pretty. BTC is broken and if I had to guess, Bitcoin Cash will prevail over-time once people start realizes things have changed and it can't remain the same. Those fees are crazy. I have been analyzing this for a good month and have heard both sides with clear eyes. I hope someone tells me I am wrong but something is clearly broken. In order for technology to advance, you must iterate. Otherwise you get stuck in legacy mode. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:12:24
Oh don’t worry, it will dip more. I know I’ll get downvotes for saying this but Bitcoin, B Core, B Cash or whatever you want to call it is broken.  The utility of it has been destroyed. 
For example, let’s say I give you....
 $200 worth of bitcoin. Once claimed post fees you will receive approximately $10 worth of bitcoin. Why? Full blocks and high fees. 
$400 worth bitcoin cash. Once claimed post fees you would receive approximately $399.98 worth of bitcoin cash. 
Fees will vary depending on your wallet/service, but you get the point. 
Every successful store in value often has more than one use case.  What do I mean by this? Simply put....
A home is a great store in value. It’s also great for living in! 
Gold is a great store in value. It’s also great for dental fillings or wearing jewelry. 
The more every day use cases the better.

Yeah it’s missing a front end UI. Mass adoption requires easy to use front end. 
Crypto is clunky as fuck. 
Put your mom in front of it and you will see what’s missing.

Really? Brilliant comment. I see you are knowledgeable about domains. So how is sedo and every aftermarket domain site still in business after all these years and how have I sold domains before. Those recent weekly crypto domain sales numbers from domain name journal must be fake too and the domain brokers who tell them must be lying.  Furthermore, I require all prospective buyers to submit social info / linkedin / whitepaper and details about their project. It's just too bad I can't read Chinese and Google translate doesn't work well. Do you know how many prospective buyers come from the land of Shitcoin founding? These scam coin teams have a ton of money to blow. The prices are also directly related to those who got in BTC early. You know how much I paid for my BTC's in 2012? I don't know where you are from but a pack of smokes costs more. 
EDIT: CryptoGame.com sold for $85,000 last week according to DNJ. ZERO TRAFFIC. 
Do you need more proof that you know nothing?

To pair usd to bitcoin or whatever you need to be in US.  Or licensed which means regulated.

Ok I’m lying. You fucking serious? I 100% own a domain that’s a lot similar to iPhone.com but you remove the ‘phone’ and put ‘blockchain’ and that’s mine so go pound sand. Typical miserable redditor. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 08:27:05
It was actually confirmed by that Irish film guy Andrew O Hagen. He showed 3 people proof of having the private keys before the taping but he wasn’t comfortable doing it on air.  I don’t really care but he was first, owns the most coins of anyone, court docs reveal a lot. His temperament mimics that of Toshi. If you take the time to hear him speak he knows more than anyone. Yes, I understand people want the mystery to remain but after watching this for a few years I believe him as he said he and two others played a role in bitcoin. Apparently the other two died. The court docs state he wrote paper and his friend who died wrote the code. They mined 1m coins. Mark my words the court case or story will be purchased by Hollywood and you have the next Social Network movie in 2020.

Most offers are upwards of 60k. highest offer has been $90k usd. I request payment in half ETH / half BTC bc I like strategic gambling. 
About 40 days ago block-chain.com sold for $30k since then the offers have ramped up.  Crypto domain sales have been off the charts lately. I have not received a single message from anyone from US. 
I think I’m going to find a translator.  There are just too many types individual dialects and I’m probably insulting them with google translate.

Gavin said  "It's certainly possible I was bamboozled" but this is just him second guessing himself because this is what happens when two sides go at it. 
I did read the suit and I have a pretty good understanding.  there’s a lot of information in their that proves he and his friend worked on it together before anyone else. Message to each other. 
You can believe what you want. I can see why he didn’t want to go public or presented fake keys. Perhaps he didn’t want that level of attention because once this gets out to the masses he’s in the spotlight for the nobel, Bottom line is that he was one of the first guys in and mined like crazy when nobody knew what it was. 
I’m not hear to argue over nothing. My vote is for wright? You got anyone? Didn’t think so...

Google and YouTube has ads?  Haven’t seen one in years thanks to chrome Adblock. So I started my boycott a long time ago.

Maybe it was planned because he didn’t want to come forward in public even though he could have. Sometimes people are forced into the spotlight and they feel like a way out is worth the scorn. Do you really think people want to believe satoshi exist? At this point there’s no way for it to not be a conspiracy.  Does he have anything to gain by proving things? He has more bitcoin than anyone. He loves what he does. Doesn’t care what people think. He’s not a normal guy.  Genius’ are on another level, and as much as people don’t want to admit he’s a really smart guy because they are sticking with Satoshi doesn’t exist side, he is actually beyond brilliant with or without bitcoin / blockchain. There’s no disputing he was one of the first in bitcoin. 
You have the non believers and the believers. I’m as skeptical as anyone and I have no reason to believe he was not a member of the satoshi crew. 
Nuff said

PM acct email address and anything relevant. My friend had a similar problem with them last summer and he was able to reverse engineer/ hack his issue until he got in. Took him several days. Then his IP was immediately blocked but got his funds out. I'm sure he'd send it back because he has more btc than he knows what to do with.
