UBI doesn’t necessarily mean socialism and communism.

The bigger the crash the better. It’ll make the rebound much more satisfying 
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:12:43
I strongly believe it’ll be $40,000-$100,000 by year end.

I can buy/sell on Coinbase but I want to start buying and selling on GDAX for lower fees
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:57:18
Thanks.

You can’t really compare the dotcom bubble to BTC. Dotcom bubble resulted in people just pumping money into businesses with no underlying business plan, they just had a domain name. BTC however has some sort of value it’s just a matter of speculating how much each is actually worth. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:36:54
No one can teach a class on bitcoin rather they’re probably teaching you the basics of economics. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:59:54
Yeah I want out just because you can’t withdraw CDN. What exchange are you using?
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:43:55
This isn’t even a big dip. I’ll hodl through 90% Dips

Paying taxes is for suckers 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:33:27
Anytime is a good time to buy. Bitcoin is meant to be held so don’t worry about getting in on a good dip. I’d recommend just buying x amount on a weekly basis that way it’ll balance out the highs and lows. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:45:38
Thanks for the reply. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:03:42
QuadrigaCX, Coinsquare, or GDX. Lower fees as opposed to Coinbase and you can cash out in Canada. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:08:32
Just tell them you got lucky at the casino 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:17:38
Depends on how much you’re worth. If you only have 4K in the bank then no. If your portfolio is worth 40k then it’s pretty nice to have 10% in BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:12:39
I ended up purchasing it for about $15 at the time 
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:04:48
I did this but Coinbase fees are very high 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:29:13
Are withdrawals from GDAX supported in Canada?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:11:36
When too many people chase too few of goods. The price increases.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:36:32
When the price goes back down to what it’s “supposed to be”. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:32:13
What platform did you buy it on ?
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:24:48
Weekly contributions is better for dollar cost averaging. So if one week you buy $250 worth of BTC an all time high the next week you may buy it during a dip and it’ll even out. It’s much better in the long term. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:54:17
No need

This is great. I’ve been wondering how to do this for a while .
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:06:37
Likely does not have a great effect on the actual price on bitcoin. It’ll be people advertising their short positions that will encourage to sell and vice versa 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:56:02
Buy alts and spend the money in my wallet to buy 10 lambos 
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:14:13
How much do you think those will each be worth in 2022?
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:22:21
It’ll be 15 million in 10 years 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:38:20
Any investment can end badly. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:34:00
Sell now and rebuy at 13k
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:23:58
The end lol

When bitcoin develops the technology to transact as quick as Credit/debit payments. Then we will see the true value of Crytos. Until then, we’re just buying and holding. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:01:08
Probably, that’s why you just hold because eventually technology will advance and fees will one day be too small to even notice. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:52:51
Limited supply + high demand = increase in price 
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:35:02
Bitcoin 35k and Litecoin $900
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:00:22
That’s a rip off
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:33:31
You don’t have to own a full coin. I can’t afford a full coin either because I’m a university student but I still invest $500 every month. Who cares if you’re getting %1000 return every year, you’d make about 8% with stocks.

Passport and drivers license ? I currently only have drivers on Coinbase. Maybe I’ll add the passport

90% of people have less than 1 BTC

Thank you! Just signed up

Any entry point is a good entry point. It’s just a matter of how long you can withstand the volatility. Overtime you will make money. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:18:52
Lol I haven’t paid taxes since 2007 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:15:47
And if you waited 1 more year you would’ve spent 50k+!

Coinbase deposits are instant for me

I’m a big fan of Schiff but he’s wrong about bitcoin. He always try’s to predict things like housing crashes and market crashes .. now btc 
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:11:43
Yeah I think it’s a matter of BTC only starting to be adopted as a currency. Once it is as widely popular as traditional fiat currency then that’s when it will become backed by institutions etc. Also BTC has the interesting characteristic of having a limited supply as opposed to fiat where there is a deliberate inflation rate being imposed on us via central banking system. I think this is what makes it extremely powerful and most people are realizing this. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:00:31
Coinbase was down for about a day for me in Canada, was able to do ID verification next day
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:57:05

May as well just take out your 401k and go to the casino instead. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:04:34
How long ago did you transfer? It can take up to 6 hours apparently 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:59:01
I wouldn’t. Because the next dip could be higher than your selling price. Then you’d be out money. I’d just hold. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:52:21
Just don’t pay taxes 
@_date: 2018-02-17 23:01:09
Sounds pointless. I’d rather have a cash referral
