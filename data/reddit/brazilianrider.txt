Drop down to $3k and everyone who missed the initial buy in will blast it right back up lol

Eh, to be honest, it was two bitcoins I fell on. It would've helped pay for a new phone, but it wasn't a TON of money... Kinda ironic/sad how they withdrew it literally MINUTES before I cashed it all in. If Mt. Gox hadn't have gone down, I'd have my $220 right now... :(
Anywho, I emailed Blockchain.info to see if there was any information they could give me. I don't expect to get a refund, but I just wanna know if they can give me anything to go on...

Same... I got my first bitcoin last year for doing something on Minecraft when it was still worth $5... I left it in there and checked a few days ago to see it was at $160 (a bit after the crash), so I pulled out my $160 and today I bought two again for $70 each...
Now I just wanna sell them for my $210 and just buy a new cell phone lol. Like a mini-surprise-Christmas.

Anybody have any idea?
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:08:09
Dammit, I guess I'm riding with Mt. Gox then...
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:22:16
I don't know what's happening. I was looking to sell all my bitcoins when mtgox came back up. When it did, I logged into blockchain.info, and I had 0.00btc there. I look in my recent transactions and it says I traded to  1KfFsi9KbvNGpQSkbvuTHrzUWGD2msnvJb ... however, I did no such thing! What do I do??!
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:02:46
Yeah, who knows? We see. It's all over now, and I just treat it like money I never had. Nothing lost, nothing gained (especially since I was gifted those bitcoins to begin with).

Same... my computer wallet was going slow, and I wanted to cash out (I only have 2 bitcoins that I got a long time ago) so I hope to God everything is going to be fine...
You have a lot more money riding on it, however...

Fantastic, lol. Well that ends my Bitcoin endeavor. Do you have any idea how I can best scan my computer? Do you think Microsoft Security Essentials will find the bugger?
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:01:15
Well I was literally seconds away from withdrawing everything and converting to USD. If Mt. Gox hadn't crashed, I'd have been clear.
I'm honestly through with dealing with bitcoins. This was gonna be my great escape, but I guess I just got burned.
Did you contact blockchain support by any chance? Did they tell you anything?
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:51:27
Fantastic. Well, at least we can cry together. I was literally minutes from moving it :(
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:53:56
Imported a private key, why?
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:11:37
Yeah, I didn't even know those features existed as I made the wallet today :/
Really unlucky lmao
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:06:59
Is there anyway I can get my bitcoins from Mt. Gox to fastcash4bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:27:26
I still have my wallet.dat saved... is there something I can do with that?!
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:54:54
Yeah, fuck this, I'm cashing out now.
EDIT: As soon as fastcash4bitcoins.com is up...

When do you think that'll be? 'Cause that's when I'm gonna sell my 2 coins and GTFO.
Sorry guys, I know you all believe in the integrity of bitcoin, and I think it's great, but as a college kid who stumbled onto two bitcoins last year and didn't know what to do with them... I want a new phone.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:51:21
Yup, got it too... hope everything is fine!
