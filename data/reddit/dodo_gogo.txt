They are exchanging the tether for assets thats how the tether gets into the marketplace
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:25:00
Watch them all buy ethereum n alts cuz lightning still hasnt happened lol
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:52:32
Its not destroyed! if they buy a billion usd of btc w tether then they then sell it for fiat and the btc is back in the ecosysytem now they have issued n iou of a billion usd and they hold a billion in fiat.
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:59:24
Its not weird man. Are mortgages weird? Are business loans weird?
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:06:50
Hmm this seems like it would work...so both sides have to publish the same transaction for it to not be considered a cheat?
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:59:36
I qlways assumed this was how bitcoin worked... u recieve bitcoin in an address n then when you send it the entire amount is sent to two addresses, but How n why do ppl have the same address n keep using it?
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:57:41
Its not fake money its an iou.
If i buy 10$ of btc and give you ten sticks and say i will anyone a dollar for each stick
And then i go and sell that btc for 10$ 
Now i have 10$ and im on the hook for $10, one dollar for each stick.
If i get 1 stick now im going to pay out one dollar
There are now 9 sticks and i have 9$
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:56:23
Bitcoin transactions r pretty fast rn... wat gives?
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:54:22
What if they cheat 1 second before expiration??

If bank of america or chase started a crypto exchange they would make so much money
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:19:37
Yea but thats its secondary function at the moment. Right now exchanges need dollars but the banks arent providing. They have enough assets that they should have access to dollars, this is basically a workaround and its safe enough as long as the markets dont crash. Realistically the ppl who will end up wanting to change out large amounts of usdt to usd will probably be big enough that tether will comply ie the exchanges and whales.   Small fry like us in the meanwhile can use it as a safe haven during dips.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:21:02
Yea but if ppl hodl then you will see the mother of all short squeezes

Thats not true at all if 6 billion people own $10k usd worth of all cryptos n btc only owns 10% of the crypto marketshare you still win

@_date: 2017-12-09 21:37:03
Nah its worse than that currently ..transactions are secured centrally lol the tangle concept only works when theres trillions of transactions but in the near future this is expected to happen because of the internet of things

@_date: 2017-12-13 01:44:39
Imagine if you could invest in the actual internet itself n claim ownership of the vast array of transactions that came after its growth. Thats what crypto currencys are goong to be
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:06:13
Volume isnt compareble
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:12:57
It just requires way more transactions to be self sufficient n secure but its different enough frm btc to be inyeresting where as many alts are literally rendered useless if lightning worksout

You cant force ppl to but if ppl like the idea they might opt in early because they see how transformative tech can create wealth

If I was Google I would replicate bitcoin/litecoin/altcoin. Basically the blockchain tech.  Because in the end it's all about the blockchain and the network size, not about who started what or who gets credit for what or who should get the payout.
I would put out massive advertisements for it for a year before the start date of mining so everyone can start mining at the same time. This way they can create a huge network because everyone will have an incentive to join early, you can create a huge network power right off the bat. 
They can take out a 10 billion dollar bond and set an exchange rate early, basically paying people in dollars to start the network for them.. (so people would be able to exchange google coin for dollars from the get go. of course they should do this while holding a set amount of google coin from the beginning they could make a profit as well.
Bitcoin is currently the largest coin in terms of u.s. dollar s currently at 5 billion, so starting off by setting aside 10 billion specifically for the exchange of google coin at a rate of perhaps 600 dollars per google coin, effectively making the real world value already at double that of bitcoin would be quite a reasonable investment. Everything would be properly incentivized and distribution would be even overcoming peoples reticent to join the bitcoin movement.
If this happened it would likely increase crypto currency infiltration probably by enormous orders of magnitude. The scale of their network size right off the bat would be ENORMOUS.
Because in the end it's about the tech right? it's about the block chain right?
they could bring block chain to the masses in a big way and so quickly I think they would deserve a big payout by holding  set amount of PUBLICLY VIEWABLE  Google coins before release.
@_date: 2014-12-10 17:55:27
if i was google, i would start a google coin.
advertise the shit out of it before the first mining date.
stabilize it while agreeing to only hold a preset amount,
profit and legitimize bitcoin protocol and really bring it to the masses.
bitcoin needs a user base, the new user base can be created by google.
they'll make a fuck load of money by holding it.
start by offering an  exchange rate so peopl can easily transfer in and out w different currencies, take out a 10 billion dolalr bond.
then they can stabilize and gain the user base that bitcoin lacks.
more people have a chance to get on board in the beginning and becasue so many ppl have heard of bitcoin and seen how fast it can rise,  they have a huge motivation to join in on the mining early on. can gain a huge user base.  all the bitcoin miners will probably switch over because they can get more value.
googel can also set it so that there is a slight amount of inflation,  because lets face it deflation is bad.. 1 or 2 % inflation is the best
i'm rambling, but you get
@_date: 2014-12-10 18:11:59
bitcoin in terms of u.s. dollar s currently at 5 billion, they could start off by setting asside 10 billion specifically for the exchange of google coin at a rate of 600 dollars per google coin, effectivally making the real world value already at double that of bitcoin.
they could start out with a network 100000x time the size of current bitcoin with the right advertising
@_date: 2014-12-10 18:31:06
where's the incentive for new miners?
if they start it over there''s 100000000x the incentive to be a miner.
why the fuck would i want to start mining bitcoin now?
but if it starts from ground zero i have a chance to get in early.  everyone else has a chance to get in early everyone can see how it benefits them selves.  use that greed or oppurtunism to create a stronger bigger network while profiting and REALLY bring crypto to the masses.
who gives a fuck about bitcoin, it's about the fucking block chain tech becoming prevelant right?  bitcoin proved it's viable great let them have their payout they can cash out now whwatevr, but lets bring the blockchain to masses now.
@_date: 2014-12-10 18:44:54
no what i want is the whole network.
the whole world connected, faster.
if everyone starts at the same time i'm not going to get rich.
also the people who started bitcoin early let em cash out and be rich, who cares. i don't care.
but right now the incentive for non bitcoiners to become part of the network is so slow, block chain uptake is so slow.
if google pulled this off we'd be living in a block chain world in 5 years.

Will they be holding the bitcoin after the transaction or are they converting it to dollars immediately?

i think people grasp exactly how big the blockchain technology can get, i think people on bitcoin overestimate the probability that bitcoin is the coin that will create the revolution.
@_date: 2014-12-10 19:12:21
no distrubution is a huge barrier to bitcoin.  you even know it unconsciously because the firstthing you accused me of was being jealous of early bitcoin adopters.
now i'm not going to say i'm not a little jealous, but honestly i thnk early bitcoin adopters are fucking smart as shit and deserve wahtever profits they earned.
that being said, if you think i, who believe in the blockchain and what it can do for the world and i onw bitcoin as well, have that mentality what abou the majority of everyone else?
sorry i copy pastaed to clean up the text.
@_date: 2014-12-25 16:44:28
This is how i feel. Ita the bxlockchain thats significant. In terms of platforms tho where ppl gather bitcoin reminds me of dmyspace. Something better is coming.
@_date: 2014-12-10 18:09:34
no they don't need to be the trusted third party at all,
they just literally replicate bitcoin like all the other coins, lite coin doge coin except, they advertise the shit out of befeore they go to release.
they can just start it off same as all the other coins except at a bigger scale, they would have to disclose how many coins they have, everyone would be able to see it.
the thing w bitcoin at this point is not about the tech, it's about the entwork, the bigger the network the stronger the real world power of the cryptocurrency system.
you would get EvRYONE onboard,  which is what bitcoin is failing to do... all the other "infrastructure specifically for bitcoin" that is being putting in place can be repllicated.
bitcoin in terms of u.s. dollar s currently at 5 billion, they could start off by setting asside 10 billion specifically for the exchange of google coin at a rate of 600 dollars per google coin, effectivally making the real world value already at double that of bitcoin.

some one posted this in another thread
Please don't use the blockchain for e-mails. That will bloat it so much. This is exactly the purpose of Bitmessage and why it uses a ROLLING message cache, and messages aren't protected by miners but by the computing power of the sender. All messages need POW behind them and are forwarded for two days on a best effort basis.
It's a fantastic setup, and far preferable to using a permanent ledger that everybody must keep in order to send a temporary message that only one other person needs to see.
I get that you're "allowed" to do it -- Bitcoin must necessarily be open to all uses, otherwise you introduce central censorship -- but please PLEASE think about the network and the effects of what you're doing before doing that type of thing. Try to find better ways. For example, if you want to prove ownership of a document, make an OP_RETURN tx with the hash of it, and sign things with the input address. Then there's only a few extra bytes on the blockchain, and you can forever prove copyright of that arbitrarily big document.
Similarly, use Bitmessage. The order of the message doesn't matter, and the other person still knows it's from you if you sign it, so putting it on the Bitcoin blockchain is just wasteful and unnecessary.
yeah that's a pretty glaring weakness too if you can bloat the shit out of the network sounds like a good way to fuck it up too

they could hold 1000000 g coin that will be worth 100's of billions in dollars, at the cost of holding 10 billion dollars in escrow because people probably won't even exchange out.
or they could spend and lose 10 billion to buy as many bitcoins on the market.

You are a fucking idiot, inflation is a good thing.  If you have deflation there is no incentive to spend the wealth inequality you fucking dumb socialist pricks qq about would be 1000x worse, no one would loan money, no business growth, nothing could function

Its cuz you dont know how business and debt function, if you need to go to engineering med school and you have to take on debt, that is good debt unless you have a deflationary currency, imagine taking on 200k debt and thirty years later 200k can buy a a building how the fuck r ppl gona pay that off? In business too there are opportunities that are time sensitive so you take on debt to take advantage, ppl assume all debt is bad but debt is necessary for life to work. You dont want to have ppl saving up for twenty years to go to school, opportunities exist on a time limit, you dont have infinite time
@_date: 2019-03-07 22:52:23
You are willfully blind i been buying bitcoin since it was 100$ i think its going to serve a useful function i also think the fed is keeping interest rates too low which is going to hurt the lower rung folk in the economic status when inflation effects start to hit, but you literally just ignore how functional the system is because youre so bought in to the bullshit ppl sellin to try to pump n dump crytpo.  There are inefficiencies. But because of that u think u throw out everything and u have determined What you want is ppl to completly stop trading with each other something humans have been doing since the dawn of civilization and only save. Thats fucking retarded.
@_date: 2019-03-08 07:41:55
You are so dumb ppl kept trying deflationary currency for hundreds of years and it failed everytime exactly because of what i described. You need to study history, the american empire may be on the decline in terms of gdp growth but i dont see europe disappearing anytime soon n neither will the usa.  
@_date: 2019-03-08 06:50:49
You cantake on debt to buy a house or an education now for 200k
In twenty years you can buy an entire shopping center. With 200k because its deflationary the currency has increased purchasing power
If you still have that debt, now you are a slave to that debt because instead of having to earn a house worth of money you have to earn a shopping centers worth of money.

I think u dont know wat deflationary currency is.
If you can buy one apple today and two apples tommorow just cuz u hoarded yur currency, u have a deflationary currency.  
Its literally been proven ineffective over the entire course of human history.  Inflationary currencies promote the circulation of capital, by adding incentive to make that money re enter circulation.  Currency needs to have movement.  Businesses need loans, businesses (i kno its hard to believe for fuckin idiots who never had a job or worked) actually provide utility to ppl, in a fairly efficient way, maybe not perfectly efficient, but good enough.  Who the fuck will give out a loan if u can just sit on capital and have it buy twice the amount of shit u want in a couple years?
Fucking myopic idiots only considering their own situation with no understanding about how businesses function.  This bullshit makes me more and more certain crypto is not going to take off.  Fucking idiots

Its not, all currency at their core are essentially an iou. You think trade didnt exist before the dollar?  The dollar is the best iteration of currency the world has seen backed by the economic activity and legal system of the usa. You have zero understanding of the real world.  All economies have historically had boom bust cycles where the bust actually exacerbates itself.  Modern banking is just the best solution humans have come up with to prevent the severity of those busts. Modern capitalism has improved avg lifespans by 30 years it is on the path to all but eliminating infant mortality, you think these improvements just pop out of thin air?

In the future i imagine an app where you hold 20 to 100 cryptos n u put a setting of how much u want to withdraw from each n u spend n recieve that way w higher withdrawl n payment rates depending on compatability w your transactee.
But in the near term bitcoin will stick around im sure as its the easiest safest way to gain access to the crypto space. Long live bitcoin

This is what i imagine i dont think banks can convince enuff ppl to download an app to be a node or a miner. Googl amzn fb apple joint venture. They have huge internet connected user bases. Turn every user into a miner. How? Each company puts up 2 or 3 billion dollars with which they guarantee to exchange googamznfbapple for usd. Free money for everyone who dl the app!! And then On top of that for every purchase main with the new coin on amzn itunes or for ad purhases on fb n googl give a 10% discount based on the exchange rate that gets established. They also only get to start out with a certain amt of coin so theyre not too powerful. Now we can have a Decentralized one currency for the whole world that ppl actually use!! Yay

Im not talking about centralized!!!!! What are you talking about?!?! They just need to premine 10% and then let it decentralize n advertise it so they get network effect!!!!

So you can use the money to do productive things instead of just sitting on it and waiting for it to go up in value, also if you have ever done business, lets say you make a sample for a product that costs $10
Then you go out and get and order for 10000and they will pay you $11 for each product
Now you go out and get a loan for $100x10000
For $1million.
And begin the process of setting up production.  Can take anywhere from 3 months to two years
You finish the production deliver the goods and get paid, for a profit of $100,000 and then return the lender their money plus INTEREST.
Now lets say that currency is deflationary.
First off the lender has no reason to lend you money if they wont get some interest payment because you could spend that $1million fuck everything up and they would just be out a million dollars.  Thats the risk they take and they need compensation in the form of interest.
Secondly if they just held on to the money for a year,  in a deflationary situation, they could guarantee they will be able to buy more shit as their currency will be more valuable, and they coukd achieve this without the risk of you fucking everything up with their money!  Yes the potential return might be less than what your willing to offer in terms of interest, but they can literally just sit on their ass and be able to buy more stuff in a year.
Now in an inflationary environment, their currency becomes worth less and less, so now they have a much greater incentive to loan you the money with your orders booked.
This is the merit of an inflationary monetary system, doesnt mean it doesnt have its flaws, ive often felt that there should be two types of currencies, one used between business and one btw normal ppl. But yea hope this makes sense to you.  Lot of younger people who have never tried to start a business might not have this insight.

Except price to earnings is at reasonable levels. Corporate debt is at reasonable levels inflation is nowhere to be seen, and the level of tech available to every us citizen is 10000x more expensive and valuable than anything a roman citizen ever had, we are entering a new age of prosperity. Govt debt is high but as % of gdp+ all u.s assets its miniscule.
China may one day become the defacto reserve currency of the world but their modus operandi is killing student protesters and muslim internment camps.

Right instead of saving the idea is you put the money to work, but realistically most normal folk are busy working so they dont have the time to go out and save their money and find worthwhile investments to grow their money, thats why we have index funds, its historically returned 8% which easily outpaces inflation and even w all the economic headwinds its still slated for 5-6% returns.  The idea is that you can grow the production of necessities by putting your earned capital back into the ecosystem is actually one the most important tools mankind created to achieve most of the beneficial things we have in our lives today ala medicines tech entertainment etc. that being said there are some flaws as well and i dont think a deflationary monetary system would fix them. Sure it would help out savers but it disincentivezes risk taking, what we need is a way to punish stupid risk taking which is what the subprime mortgage crisis was the result of, people in banking took out 80x leverage to essentially pick up pennies in front of an incoming bulldozers by mathematically “eliminating risk” ie the odds of a large swath of the population defaulting on loans is 99.9999% impossible due to math, which didnt really do anything productive. The idea of mortgage backed securities in itself is actually a good idea, but taking out 70x leverage to “invest in a foolproof” interest earnings was absolutely stupid.
Anyway i think the future will still be ok, we have tech that will still allow us to creat goods cheaply and hopefully we can start figuring out new things to put value into so that new jobs can be created.
Like a mom token. All the stuff that moms do that arent paid for should be paid for by mom tokens and that should be its own currency system.  And then having a bunch of groups like that and being able to move between networks for exchange of services based on a monetary system of necessity for normal people might be a future created by crypto currency.

Theres a lot of fear mongering in these threads, cuz its pro crypto.
Govt debt is high historically but it its tiny as a percentage of the total wealth of the usa.
That being said there are legit concerns that we will face some hardships as inflation rises, but if you look at japan the country is not dying.  What happened to japan is what will happen, ( also remember the govt can start buying up shares of companies to keep prices stable, i think the bank of japan owns around 4% of japans companies), not some sorta catastrophic shit like venezuela.  Venzuelans produce nothing of value.
Still crypto is going to be around for a long time n you should put aside a little bit for btc n some alts.
Maybe 5-20% of your portfolio.
Stocks pe is at a historical normal.  Thats the price to earnings ratio good for getting historical context of how companies are being valued.
