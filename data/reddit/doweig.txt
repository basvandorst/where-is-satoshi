Hmm sounds interesting, do you have a 2d racing game from the top of your mind that I can look into?

Yes the content writer sets a funding goal for the post, and the cost per letter gets calculated from that.
@_date: 2019-03-22 09:31:24
Lmao that’s a good use case actually
@_date: 2019-03-22 09:20:17
Hahaha yeah, no one forcing you though. The rich get social rewards, their name being glorified. The poor get free content
@_date: 2019-03-22 12:59:44
That's interesting, yes. Do you have the name of the service doing the pictures?

Nobody wants to clean sewers, work in a fast food restaurants or clean floors. Even designing robots to do those tasks would be boring.
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:06:29
Yes! Exactly

Miners only need to build mining farms, the free market supply and demand for electricity will do it's thing.

Right, "billionaires" is intended in Fiat money equivalent. "Rich people" would be a better replacement.

Many are trying to "build product", none have been successful, none will be.
They will either sink the funds with the project or turn scammer and run away with what's left.
So your money will either end up being wasted or in the hands of a scammer.

For anyone interested in the numbers I estimate the current network energy consumption to be ~45 TWh from:
* 
* 
If the price goes up 100x then we get 4,500 TWh (which is not prefect would probably need more as hashrate is still growing)
2014 electricity consumption was 23,816 according to 
* 
so we get 4,500 / 23,816= ~19%

Captain here, I live in Beijing, China.
Can't operate from China, can't accept CNY (Chinese currency), and for some they refuse if the IP is Chinese (therefore needs a VPN)
That is the definition of banned to me.
So sure, while the Chinese exchanges may be thriving, they are not servicing Chinese customers.

On the Bitcoin network, there's one new block roughly every 10 minutes
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:03:48
Yes! We will probably end up with solutions like this. Or even mining satellites in front of the sun directly.

Exactly, and money have enable a magnitude of cooperation that was  unthinkable under barter.
Say I want to build a rocket for the moon, how do I get the worker from the steel company to get up in the morning and to work together to extract and refine the steel, how to buy the machinery necessary for the work?
How do I get SpaceX to hire engineers, get them to think and design the blueprints, and then get the necessary components for my rocket?
All of this is possible because employees want salary and companies want profits, everybody wants money.
No money = no rocket to the moon.
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:46:24
Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:18:48
How can you have the concept of money without rich and poor? Sounds like you are talking about UBI, or communism.

Electricity is definitely based on the bitcoin price, I wouldn't get my farm running on 10k$ a day of electricity if I mine 0.1 BTC worth 5000$ a day. I would shutdown miners.
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:43:49
Right, that's a good point i forgot to mention. We still have a good 10-20 years with the block reward above 1BTC per block.
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:50:10
Alright that's a fair point, 90% is a bit excessive. 
Point being that we shouldn't compare bitcoin to fiat or gold mining saying that is less than those, because in the future bitcoin energy consumption will dwarf them for sure.

Hello, thank you for your comment.
Yes so there are 2 payments every hour, you pay me 1 sat and I pay you 1 sat so the net cost is 0.
The python scripts are really simple, really short and well commented. It’s the easiest solution i could find.
If you think of a way to have automated actions on your ln node without those python scripts i would love to hear it.
The name is just for better email communication, particularly if you decide to sub to the newsletter.
Put John Doe if you don’t wanna give your real name, fine by me.

Oh that's pretty smart actually.
How would you generate and send me the invoices?
@_date: 2019-09-18 09:15:59
After searching online i found something called lnurl who does something like that, will dig more.
Anyways, thank you for the suggestion, really appreciate

Awesome to see more bitcoin hardware companies!
Just filled the "contact us" form for a possible business cooperation in China.
Hope to hear from you soon ;)
