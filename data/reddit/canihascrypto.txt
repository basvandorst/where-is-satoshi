Yeah, it’s a pain in the ass. But doesn’t change the fact that ver is a piece of shit

If I ever see ver at a conference, I’ll probably go to jail. My aunt downloaded that. Then lost a couple bitcoin cause she sent it to a btrash address, because she thought it was a bitcoin wallet like she downloaded. Fuck that fucking prick.

Blinded by profits? My 85 year old fucking aunt went to bitcoin . Com and followed all the shit ver has up. She bought 8 bitcoin when they were at 12k  off coinbase , for her fucking 8 grandkids. She had nothing to do with profits. She was putting them into her will for them to get when they are 18. They are all 7and under, it was a suprise in the will.  But yeah following a place that says it’s bitcoin but it’s fucking btrash.  
Fuck ver. Fuck btrash.

You can have an opinion all the fuck you want. 
Here is an opinion. 
Bcash is fucking trash. 
Here is a false statement- bcash is bitcoin. 
That web page does nothing but promote btrash as fucking bitcoin- its  not an opinion, of weather it’s bitcoin or not. The bitcoin I had in 2015 is still bitcoin. Btrash is a fork that has a rich manipulator who buys things to influence people that btrash isn’t trash.

Sounds like a fucking scamming prick that needs his ass kicked. 
People that are just getting into crypto don’t know the better.  They see something a rich manipulator runs that is a ‘bitcoin wallet’ that really sets up   A fucking trash wallet
Is it a noobs fault for getting manipulated by ver? Or ver fault for manipulating things? I’ll go with Vera fault- and deal with him accordingly when I see him at a conference
