how does that (money to an address) = the user in question purchasing a "fake ID" as you claim?  You know how many people in the world have used cash not totally on the up and up?  **Imagine if everyone who ever did that and everyone who ever gave cash to someone who did something questionable with cash was banned from banking**.  Coinbase is a fucking joke... and you DO cyberstalk your customers, one does not have to do anything else but look at the maleware tracking cookies on your site to verify that fact.
**Cancel some more orders after withdrawing cash from people's bank accounts instead of trolling reddit with your shitty (beyond KYC) business practices.**  I expect nothing less than stealing from and mistreating of customers from a company that was started by an ex-Goldman employee.  Coinbase fails to dissapoint in that regard.
Also Mr. Coinbase rep:  "We are not investigating transactions **really far away from the source.**"  How far from the source do you track (and I'm actually shocked Coinbase is admitting this)?  You realize once cash is withdrawn from the bank, there is literally no tracking AT ALL... right?  How do you defend tracking coins after ANY "hops"?  Don't come at us with KYC BS when the banks aren't doing it.
Care to answer that while you call out people on reddit?

Which will be more than a credit card fee and pointless... which makes bitcoin pointless to the masses.  Bitcoin needs to be decentralized and the only way to do that is remove the 1mb cap that was never suppose to stay in place.  Otherwise, we are all at the mercy of companies running off the chain for transactions, which makes bitcoin even more pointless, we already have visa and mastercard.
@_date: 2015-06-23 13:56:55
No.  Bitcoin needs to scale.  Removing a 1mb limit that was never meant to be permanent is a tiny baby step.  Anyone saying anything else has an agenda.  If Bitcoin doesn't scale, there will be more centralized services that will counter all the innovation of the blockchain and underlying benefits by recentralizing everything.
@_date: 2015-06-22 14:38:46
bitcoin is not private.  it publishes the transaction in the global ledger forever.

**The link has far more in depth analysis but here is a snippit.**
" Distributing government benefits is a lucrative industry. According to the Government Accountability Institute, J.P. Morgan Chase, which currently controls EBT contracts in 21 states, Guam, and the Virgin Islands, made more than half a billion dollars between 2004 and 2012 providing government benefits to U.S. citizens. In New York alone, J.P. Morgan Electronic Financial Services (EFS) holds a nine-year, $177 million EBT services contract with the State Office of Temporary and Disability Services (OTDA). New York currently pays $0.95 per month for each its 1.7 million SNAP cases. In addition, J.P. Morgan EFS collects penalties and fees from benefit recipients: $5 to replace a lost EBT card, $0.40 for each balance inquiry, $0.50 each time their cards are declined for insufficient funds, and $1.50 per withdrawal if they use ATMs to get cash more than once a month. While information about profit margins on EBT contracts is neither collected at the national level nor released by banks, EBT is a significant growth area for big banks. Last year, the Federal Reserve Payments Study reported that the number of EBT transactions more than doubled since 2006.
Electronic benefits delivery is such a rewarding business that banks seem to fear only two things: policy changes and bad publicity."

it's called Bitcoin, and it needs a few lines of code changed to increase the blocksize (even if you believe in the lightning network per the lightning networks own whitepaper).  Anything secured by the bitcoin blockchain will have all the same attack vectors of bitcoin (because it uses the blockchain to work and depends on the blockchain security) **plus** the attack vectors of the layered code on top of Bitcoin.  In essence, **nothing built ontop of Bitcoin Blockchain and secured by it, can ever be more secure than the bitcoin payment network itself**... ever.

Yes, especially when the rewards are almost non existent.  The individual tolls will be less (so more of the world's people can utilize the blockchain individually without permissions) the more transactions that are processed.  Look at it this way, if Bitcoin could only clear 1 transaction per 10 minutes, what would the toll be right now today?  A lot higher than percentage points of a percent I think we would all agree, and everyone would be using circle and coinbase out of necessity because no one would want to pay that huge on chain fee to transact... and by using a service, you have to abide by the laws of the land the service resides in... banks already offer this service.

For all those who think the lightning network will solve the cap issue, they are wrong.  The lightning network is very insecure compared to the blockchain.  The lightning network also states that a cap increase needs to happen anyway.  I will never transact on the lightning network over the blockchain because of all the **extra attack vectors compared to using the bitcoin blockchain.**
Hotwallets, stealing coins with a lagging network, that can be lagged out with spam easily, another payment layer, more passwords to keep up with on top of your wallet (where will you store those?) and mandatory third parties... If your hoping the Lightning Network is some silver bullet, your sorely mistaken, read the damn paper.
**Whitepaper cut an paste:**
**6. Risks**
The primary risks relate to timelock expiration. Additionally, for core nodes and possibly some merchants, **funds are held online (“hot wallet”). 6.1. Improper Timelocks** Participants must choose timelocks with sufficient amount of time. If insufficient time is given, it is possible that transactions believed to be invalid will become valid, enabling coin theft by the counterparty. There is a trade-off between longer timelocks and the time value of money. **6.2. Forced Expiration Spam** Forced expiration of many transactions may be the greatest systemic risk when using the Lightning Network. If a malicious participant creates many channels and forces them all to expire at once, these may overwhelm block data capacity, forcing expiration and broadcast to the blockchain. **The result would be a mass spam on the bitcoin network.** The spam may delay transactions to the point where other locktimed transactions become valid. This may be mitigated by permitting one transaction replacement on all pending transactions. Anti-spam can be used by permitting one transaction replacement of a higher sequence number by an opposite of an even or odd number. E.g. if an odd sequence number was broadcasted, permit a replacement to a higher even number only once. Transactions would use the sequence number in an orderly way to replace other transactions. This mitigates the risk assuming honest miners. There may be some further consensus mining optimizations, as well. **This attack is extremely high risk**, as incorrect broadcast of Commitment Transactions **entail a full penalty of all funds in the channel**. Additionally, one may attempt to **steal HTLC transactions by forcing a timeout transaction to go through when it should not**. This can be easily mitigated by having each transfer inside the channel be lower than the total transaction fees used. Since transactions are extremely cheap and do not hit the blockchain with cooperative channel counterparties, large transfers of value can be split into many small transfers. This attempt can only work if the blocks are completely full for a long time. While it is possible to mitigate it using a longer HTLC timeout duration, a better method is to use a blocksize soft-cap. If this type of transaction becomes the dominant form of transactions which are included on the blockchain, it may become necessary to increase the block size and run a soft-cap structure as described in the section below. Creating a bitcoin soft-cap can create sufficient penalties and disincentives to be highly unprofitable and unsuccessful for attackers, as attackers lose all their funds from broadcasting the wrong transaction, to the point where it will never occur. **6.3. Coin Theft via Hacking As parties must be online and using private keys to sign**, there is a possibility that if one’s computer is compromised, that **coins will be stolen by the counterparty.** While there may be methods to mitigate the threat for the sender and the receiver, the intermediary nodes must be online and will likely be processing the transaction automatically. For this reason, the intermediary nodes will be at risk and should not be **holding a substantial amount of money in this “hot wallet.”** Intermediary nodes which have better security will likely be able to outcompete others in the long run and be able to conduct greater transaction volume due to lower fees. Historically, one of the largest component of fees/interest is from various forms of 16 counterparty risk -- in Bitcoin it is possible that the largest component in fees will be derived from **security risk premiums.** A Funding Transaction may have multiple outputs with multiple Commitment Transactions, with the Funding Transaction and some Commitment Transactions stored offline. It is possible to create an equivalent to a “Checking Account” and “Savings Account” by moving funds between outputs from a Funding Transaction, with the “Savings Account” stored offline and requiring additional signatures from security services. **6.4. Data Loss** When one party loses data, **it is possible for the counterparty to steal funds.** This can be mitigated by having a **3rd party data storage service** where encrypted data gets sent to this 3rd party service which the 3rd party cannot decrypt. Additionally, one should choose channel **counterparties who are responsible** and willing to provide the current state, with some periodic tests of honesty. 6.5. Forgetting to Broadcast the Transaction in Time **If one does not broadcast a transaction at the correct time, the counterparty may steal funds.** This can be mitigated by having a designated 3rd party to send funds. An output fee can be added to create an incentive for this 3rd party to watch the network. Further, this can also be mitigated by implementing relative OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY.
People who chose the above over on chain transactions (using the real bitcoin/blockchain) are not that bright.
Attack Vectors on Bitcoin(X) = the number of ways to attack Bitcoin (X).
The lightning network relies on a secure Bitcoin Blockchain to even function, therefore:
Total Attack Vectors on the Lightning Network (Z) = The number of ways to attack bitcoin (X) plus the number of ways to attack the Lightning network by itself (Y).
**X+Y=Z (the total amount of attack vectors the LN is at risk of).**
Therefore **X (attack vectors on bitcoin) &lt; Z (attack vectors on LN)** because there is no such thing as a negative amount of attack vectors. This formula will remain true until the end of time or until mathematics as we know it fails as a system.
Edit:  to all the trolls downvoting with vested interests (not people who simply don't understand or disagree) your no better than a hedge fund manager, and you deserve to choke on a big fat dick.

If they bought bitcoin a month ago they would be up a bunch, and thus its circular logic and a shitty troll post... **not to mention the fact one week ago today bitcoin was at $269/$270 and today its $279 and the euro declined versus the dollar to top it off.**

How many people are going to be securing an 8mb sidechain when they won't mine an 8mb Bitcoin core?  An 8mb sidechain would be far easier to snoop on as well with there being less nodes than bitcoin core and all (since it will be 8mb and bitcoin core will be 1mb per your thesis).

Second scenario looks more promising to Palychata:
“The second scenario is an integration within the post trade ecosystem. The distributed ledger might only be the next generation of IT infrastructure. In this scenario custodians or settlement infrastructures might use the blockchain to record the ownership and trades between themselves; however end investors will still need to use a custodian to have access to the market. The ledger will only be accessible to authorised market participants.”
**After expressing his hopes of the blockchain privatisation**, BNP Paribas analyst noted that bitcoin is doing well so far.
Epic fail.  **Also, there is no difference in letting BNP or Coinbase be your "custodian to have market access".  This is why we need &gt;1mb.  Otherwise, we are all at the mercy of companies operating off chain.**

Futhermore, "mitigating risks" does not take the risk away, with blockchain and bitcoin, these risks simply don't exist... since the LN requires a secure blockchain, the LN has all the extra attack vectors the LN opens up PLUS the few attack vectors Bitcoin has.  Therefore, the LN will ALWAYS be less secure than the bitcoin blockchain.

The lightning network will never be as secure as onchain transactions because it, the lightning network, has more attack vectors per it's own whitepaper.  **The lightning network is not a savior of p2p everyday transactions in bitcoin for several reasons.**  Attacking lightning nodes, for one, via ddos/sybil **(the attack vector is outlined in section 6.5 of the lightning network whitepaper** and a **DDOS attack can lag the nodes** to open this attack up as well as transaction spam... not unlike the spam we are seeing on the blockchain currently) Basically the Bitcoin miners don't secure the micro payments on the network at all, only the grouped transactions that are relayed to the blockchain (and the only transactions that are relayed to the bitcoin blockchain are the transactions where the lightning contract is "enforced" because of default by one of the parties). Also, lightning networks will require another fork to even implement and would require a blocksize &gt; 1mb per the devs (so that is 2 forks one being soft and one being hard). Also, funds held in a timelock on the lightning network are held in a hotwallet (section 6.0 of the whitepaper) and section **6.2 outlines the forced expiration spam attack**, **section 6.3 outlines systemic risk for theft by the counterparty as well, 6.4 outlines the risk of dataloss and lost funds (people will have to keep even more info ontop of their traditional wallet info and keys... a lot more...and where will they store that?)**.  The lightning network uses bitcoin to enforce contracts, but the lightning payment network security is in no way as secure as on chain transactions, and never will be... period.  Finally, the lightning network will require it's own fee and it will have to be high enough to combat spam, because instead of just slowing transactions (like onchain bitcoin transactions) people can actually steal your money on a lagging lightning network.

Running a trusted third party or a bunch of nodes is a lot less expensive than securing enough mining power to disrupt the blockchain, that is yet another attack vector bitcoin does not have that the lightning network has.   Also you need to trust them (trusted 3rd parties and hotwallets) or your coins can be stolen while in the lightning network.  If miners dont include transactions with bitcoin proper all your coins can't get stolen like they can on the lightning network.  Facts are Facts.
**Also you say "there is no required trust jackass" and the next line you say "There may be required trust needed to process payments" And since we are talking about a payment processing network... I think it's YOU that needs to read the entire whitepaper again instead of willfully misleading people, jackass.**

no the spammers changed the fees and structure of the spam transactions during the last phase (if this was an ongoing problem with real non spam transactions there would be a minute by minute bidding war with the end user having no idea what to enter in the transaction fee field, because everyone else would enter a number and cross their fingers).  Blockchain.info went ape shit, and my unrelated wallet had issues syncing with nodes due to the spam.  Look through the past threads during that time, it happened to lots and lots of people.  Transactions took much longer to process and be recognized, miners were ignoring blocks of spam that had legit transactions in them as well.  Bitcoin was far from unaffected.

The balance would have to be somewhere in the middle, and allow addresses on chain to transact for a significantly less amount of money than credit cards and debit cards charge to clear transactions, the only way to do that and keep miners profitable when the block rewards dissipate is to upgrade the network and allow it to process more transactions.  Even though the mb limit may be some number (call it 20mb) that in and of itself does not require the miners to mine 20mb blocks.  Many miners now don't mine at 1mb.  Chaninging the hardcap merely provides more flexibility and potential to the network (something off chain centralizers loath).

The lightning network uses bitcoin to enforce contracts, but the lightning payment network security is in no way as secure as on chain transactions, and never will be... period.

no, they are transferring "bitcoins" in a private database owned by Coinbase which also settles off chain, the blockchain is never touched.  if one would like to offload bitcoin off of coinbase via the blockchain (via a payment or transfer to a real wallet), coinbase will not absorb a huge fee like they do the small fee now.  I don't understand what people do not get about this.
@_date: 2015-07-23 16:20:17
I'm saying if miners don't mine transactions, your bitcoins can't be STOLEN like they can on the LN (which requires processing and execution of contracts secured by the blockchain).  I'm saying the LN is requiring that bitcoin miners process transactions  **Plus** the LN network is requiring third parties, responsible counterparties, and non hostile hubs...
all to process the exact same transaction, which is inherently far less secure than simply using the blockchain which only requires that some decentralized miners process transactions.
That is all I am saying, the LN will have real world use, it's just not a silver bullet people should be relying on to process a majority of crypto transactions of value on, because it has much more points of failure than Bitcoin Blockchain by definition because it relies on a secured Bitcoin Blockchain first and foremost.

@_date: 2015-07-23 15:52:49
ok i'll make it easy for you:
Attack Vectors on Bitcoin(X) = the number of ways to attack Bitcoin (X).
The lightning network relies on a secure Bitcoin Blockchain to even function, therefore: 
Total Attack Vectors on the Lightning Network (Z) = The number of ways to attack bitcoin (X) **plus** the number of ways to attack the Lightning network by itself (Y).
**X+Y=Z (the total amount of attack vectors the LN is at risk of).**
Therefore X &lt; Z because there is no such thing as a negative amount of attack vectors.  This formula will remain true until the end of time or until mathematics as we know it fails as a system.

"Ultimately, the blockchain is likely to touch every corner of the federal government. In the very near term, the Bitcoin market itself is beginning to take on new and more sophisticated shapes. Former bankers for Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, among others, are **developing futures in the currency and other derivatives that could help stabilize its price.** When those hit the market, they’ll fall under the jurisdiction of the CFTC.
Blockchain-based “smart contracts,” which will be automatically self-enforcing without the need for court intervention, will pose their own sets of challenges. Already, Evan Greebel, one of the securities lawyers handling the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF, said **he knows of efforts afoot to create smart contracts for car leases that will automatically prevent lessees who default on payments from starting their Internet-connected cars.** Surely, the CFPB and Elizabeth Warren will have something to say about that. Greebel says such contracts will have implications for the federal bankruptcy code as well.
He also predicts that import and export registries will soon migrate to the blockchain, a matter for the Federal Trade Commission to oversee. The technology is perfect for keeping track of chains of custody, so **say goodbye to your local registry of deeds** while you’re at it. 
The National Association of Voter Officials is working with a startup called V Initiative that wants to **put American elections on the blockchain and let people vote from their personal devices** – a transformation that goes to the heart of government. And IBM’s running its Internet of Things initiative on Ethereum, a new blockchain protocol that’s an alternative to the original Bitcoin blockchain.
The blockchain’s radical decentralization raises a host of newer and even stranger possibilities – for instance, markets or gambling networks that exist only as the shared interactions of dozens of users, or millions. It is possible that an illegal activity could arise, even a very large one, **with no operator to sue, threaten or shut down."**

I think the online wallet providers can also provide a discount by processing payments through them... For instance, Circle/Coinbase could offer a 5% discount for allowing them to share your personal information they have on file for you with the merchant... kind of like those Store perk cards, like PetsPerks at pets plus, or a CVS/Albertsons card...
Something like this should obviously be opt in/out just like the store cards are.

The value returned from the customer would be using the bitcoin payment platform AND agreeing in the TOS to let the payment provider disclose your real world identity associated with the transaction either "anon" like google does or non anon... either way **it will let bed bath and beyond or who the hell ever get all the info MINUS those stupid, moronic store discount cards... BOOM!**
The above is why bitcoin will be massively adopted in the future.  No one wants to carry around 30 store cards, and the stores want the damn info, and the ledger is public...  We have seen the vast majority of the public will sacrifice personal privacy for small discounts or small services (it's why those store cards work in the first place, the worst part is having to take the time to sign up).  For example, PetsPerk cards from Pets Plus offers massive discounts if you use the card, all the card does is tie your purchase to your real world name and zip code.

Two words:  **public ledger.** The public ledger is also why companies will eventually love all the info they will be able to glean from the blockchain when the coins come from places attached to your identity.  One day, services like Coinbase and Circle will sell this information, in return they will offer discounts for your purchases on their platform.  This, in my opinion, is why bitcoin will not die, and will be embraced once enough layers are in place.  The dark markets will move in another direction if that hasn't begun already.

Everything the EO says can be done to a person, has been done to Snowden, Julian, and Kim.

To clarify, they have already taken all of those 3's stuff... if you want to donate to a person/hacker/cyber-terrorist described in the EO, who already had all there stuff taken... be my guest, but it is moronic and directly spits in the face of the EO (which lets them take your stuff). Snowden not currently being on the list is a semantical, red herring arguement, because they already did all the things to him the EO would allow... GET IT?

Everything the EO says can be done to a person, has been done to Snowden, Julian, and Kim. The EO now lets the government take the stuff of people who donate to "cyber terrorists" like Snowden, Julian, and Kim. To clarify, they have already taken all of those 3's stuff... if you want to donate to a person/hacker/cyber-terrorist described in the EO, who already had all there stuff taken... be my guest, but it is moronic and directly spits in the face of the EO (which lets them take your stuff). Snowden not currently being on the list is a semantical, red herring arguement, because they already did all the things to him the EO would allow... GET IT?

Props, it's nice to see rational people thinking for themselves and protecting and fighting for what little freedom they have left... one of those ways is asking questions people don't want to answer, and looking at new laws and EO and asking "what is the worst thing they could do with something like this"... the Patriot Act taught me that.  that was meant for overseas terrorists, and turned into in mass survelliance of American citizens cellphones/data and email... and the most broad and abused definition of "terrorist" i have ever seen.

Libertarians believe in PERSONAL CHOICE and SMALL GOVERNMENT.  That is what it use to mean to be "conservative" ie Republican. I question anyone who would rather have Washington enforce moral values on people (like abortion) than allowing people to make their own choice. 
For Example Abortion:
**Repub:**  God says no, I say no, the government should say no one should have an abortion.
**Dem:**  We say yes, vote Dem and the government will allow you to have an abortion.
**Libertarian:  Abortions are non of the GOVERNMENT's damn business, it's YOUR business.**
Libertarians are different, the other 2 parties assume it's the governments roll to dictate practically everything, including personal moral choices.  How anyone could be ANTI-Libertarian is confounding to me... I could understand arguing over exactly HOW libertarian one would want to be (like funding interstate highways and the war machine) ... but to be against Libertarianism is like saying "I think the government should dictate everything to me, and I won't do anything until they tell me it is ok." .... Really?

@_date: 2015-04-04 04:33:02
Yeah you probably might not  get sanctioned for donating bitcoins to Edward Snowden right now because current political pressure mandate he isn't on a list he qualifies to be on, yet.

They can take your stuff, and defending yourself by claiming he was not on the list despite meeting all definitions of the EO will not work, you don't have a right to that defense if you are deemed to be "against the United States" by donating to known "cyber-terrorist" as described in the EO... the EO describes Snowden, Kim, and Julian to a freaking T.

"Section 1. (a) All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person of the following persons"

you linked to foriegn finance control ... it is not the list, and according to the order they can add to the real list and take assests without prior notice for anyone they deem fits the definitions, and all those giving or getting anything of value from the target.  Also, read the actual report, no where does it state: "This order does nothing more than expand the criteria of individuals eligible for OFAC's Specially Designated Nationals &amp; Blocked Persons, the Department of Treasury has to actually add someone to the list before they become a "blocked person". --- once again the order actually states they can instantly add to the list and instantly seize assets, and then gives the Department of the Treasury permission to delegate to any law enforcement agency in the nation.
**"(i) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State, to be responsible for or complicit in, or to have engaged in, directly or indirectly, cyber-enabled activities originating from, or directed by persons located, in whole or in substantial part, outside the United States that are reasonably likely to result in, or have materially contributed to, a significant threat to the national security, foreign policy, or economic health or financial stability of the United States and that have the purpose or effect of:
(A) harming, or otherwise significantly compromising the provision of services by, a computer or network of computers that support one or more entities in a critical infrastructure sector;
(B) significantly compromising the provision of services by one or more entities in a critical infrastructure sector;
(C) causing a significant disruption to the availability of a computer or network of computers; or
(D) causing a significant misappropriation of funds or economic resources, trade secrets, personal identifiers, or financial information for commercial or competitive advantage or private financial gain"**
Snowden meets the requirements as defined and explained in the order itself.  So do lots of other activists "against America". Snowden leaked encrypted files from outside the United States that were a threat to national security. 
**"(ii) any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of State:

Great!  The real threat of Obama's EO is for Snowden 2.0.  That guy is screwed, and so is everyone who attempts to support him through KYC compliant institutions. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 22:24:44
Read section 7:  Unfortunately your wrong :(
Sec. 7. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1 of this order." ... aka, they can take all your stuff without due process instantly if you have "constitutional rights" in the US (wow).
@_date: 2015-04-03 21:43:13
I posted the post in question about Snowden.  The point is, the EO describes him perfectly, Snowden already had all the negative aspects of the EO applied to him through other, more legal, and lengthy means involving other processes.  Obama ended the need for all that, and added the ability to take all your stuff if your a citizen and support people like Snowden/Julian/Kim.  However, the next Snowden/Julian will be a prime target for this EO, and Snowden/Julian might very well be in the future because they fit the criteria in the EO.  The point is this under the radar EO that got almost 0 mainstream press is the worst thing to happen since the patriot act, and now the government can take all your stuff if you are found to support anyone the US government doesn't like that this EO applies to... Snowden was the example... They are actively trying to prevent any sort of Snowden/Julian/Kim 2.0.  
Worse yet, this did not even go through congress and strips American's from supporting whistleblowers blowing the damn whistle if it has anything to do with America OR it's corporations (like banks).
You can argue semantics and all that all you like, facts are facts.  If the Snowden thing happened today, or the Julian thing with wikileaks, they would be on the F*&amp;%ing list, period end of discussion.
**Palehorse**, please end your crusade of making this EO look like a legit thing rational, freedom loving Americans should support, like the "patriot act" lol. I understand your intent, but in the end, making this EO look like it's only going to be applied to "those cyber terrorists overseas" is not a thing to do in good faith.  911 = Patriot Act, Sony Hack = This?
Really?  I don't think DDOS attacks on the playstation network, or a movie hack is a national emergency that requires an EO that can be applied to Snowden or Julian, and I damn sure don't believe they should be able to take all of your stuff for donating to people like that.  It's great he isn't on the list this second, but what the F$%&amp; is stopping it now?
Nothing.  In the end, **I'm glad a bunch of people read the EO, and determined there is absolutely NOTHING stopping them from applying it to people like Snowden and Julian, and taking all your stuff if you donate to them, because its the TRUTH.  Downplaying it as not being a current issue because they would never add Snowden to the list for "political reasons" (palehorse) is almost criminal, and the mainstream media ignoring it is as well.**

They can take your stuff, and defending yourself by claiming he was not on the list despite meeting all definitions of the EO will not work, you don't have a right to that defense if you are deemed to be "against the United States" by donating to known "cyber-terrorist" as described in the EO... the EO describes Snowden, Kim, and Julian to a freaking T.

Yes.  Phone numbers, IP Address, and transaction amounts are not... furthermore, all this information is shared with 3rd parties by Coinbase, these third parties provide further tracking, like Sift Science does in this instance.

You realize the order gave the Treasury the power to delegate those powers to any law enforcement agency right?

To make it clear, only fools speak in absolutes, and neither you or I have any idea what those encrypted messages said.  we do know Force threatened his life without hiding behind cryptography and stole money from criminals and non criminals (including the mentally challenged) and lied about it and abused his position in the DEA to perpetuate and cover up his criminal activity, lied to his superiors, and filed fraudulent paperwork in an attempt to conceal his crimes... so what a guy like that would say with encrypted messages to get more money is prob pretty spectacular.

This scam actually yields the promised returns to earlier investors (in the dollar/US Debt), as long as there are more new investors (in the dollar/US debt). These schemes usually collapse on themselves when the new investments (in the dollar/US debt) stop.**
"It's a claim on future goods and services (debt) which can be traded for other things you want."  
Until it isn't, like all the bad repackaged housing debt only the government would buy (put new investments in) to maintain the status quo of the scheme, and prevent total financial collapse of the dollar.

Bitfinex BTC:  Right now Bitcoin is 3.5x more expensive to borrow than normal... short selling is almost done...  I have found the Bitfinex swap rate to be a good leading indicator, prob. because Bitfinex trades against their own customers like Schawb and Etrade use to do.

Yeah, but what did all those encrypted messages say that Force sent?  I mean really Force could have threatened Ross' parent's lives or something...

Really bithug... "the bulk of **OUR** evidence".  who you work for bro?  I bet you 1 bitcoin either the special forces agent or dea agent knew and communicated with someone in that Baltimore office.  That my friend is reasonable doubt.  I'm sorry **YOU** people screwed things up by robbing, lying, extorting, and suppressing the facts.  If it wasn't for the I.R.S. you wouldn't have to be on the interwebs defending your evidence, you could keep living the lie and getting rich by robbing the very Americans that pay your salary.  Off that high horse you go, son.  You seem intelligent enough, too intelligent for working with and defending the police state.

Please refer to the report, exhibit B.

Read Coinbases TOS and Privacy Policy before you do anything with them... seriously.
@_date: 2015-02-26 02:43:54
Their Privacy Policy and Terms of Service is a scary read.

They just had access to the Silk Road Admin account... So what are they NOT guilty of that Ross is guilty of?  Sounds like they "ran" the silk road as admins as well.

Coinbase violates privacy beyond KYC by following after multiple hops and super cookies on their site.  When a financial company does things even banks dare not do, it will always be an issue to myself and like minded individuals.  Those people who buy the KYC and beating around the bush answers, I feel sorry for.  I mean who is OK with a banker hiding in the bushes following you around to spend the marked bills he just gave you, and then following the people around who received your cash...?
Quit justifying this BS!
@_date: 2015-03-08 17:54:02
Sounds familiar.  The paradox is bitcoin can only transmit value if a bitcoin is worth something in the first place.
@_date: 2015-02-24 22:28:33
they will just rape your privacy like google, coinbase, and facebook.  Phat profits.

Brian. Do you care to address the malware cookies Coinbase uses to violate privacy, and follow transactions?  Do you care to address following transactions after they leave the Coinbase wallets?  Before you answer, please keep in mind bankers don't follow me after I withdraw cash, so don't hide behind KYC laws and anti fraud claims.  Thanks.

exhibit B in the 95 page report, you should really read it, it is better than most short novels.

look at a 50 year chart of any fiat currency vs gold.  next, read a history book.  if you have done the previous already, take a class on critical thinking.

Maybe we should let congress know that Jamie doesn't speak for everyone.

My advice is to decentralize each part of the matketplace by having independent companies taking care of each aspect.  One company only lists, another company only does escrow and ratings... Ect ect

@_date: 2015-02-24 21:53:11
good luck securing that... and who would buy into a coin only the FED controlled?  I mean really, the FED is just a private inbred corporation that devalues it's own currency to create wealth and power for itself.

Tell me how maleware cookies and following coins after multiple hops off of their platform is reproduced in the current BANKING system that works within the KYC laws.
Coinbase has more balls than the banking cartels when it comes to being hostile to their consumer's privacy and stalking their consumer's transactions.

Hey at lest you didn't wait five days, have the bank actually take the money out, just to have coinbase cancel your order...

Hey OP, banks and I finally agree on something.  Don't transact with Coinbase.

What is this, the 3rd re-vote?  Who cares they don't represent anyone.

"It would be secured in the same way" ... i don't think you understand, there is no way it could be secured in the same way and still allow the FED to make monetary policy... Also, closed code is much easier to hack/attack than open source.

Coinbase is doing a lot more than banks do when it comes to violating the privacy of it's users.  Coinbase will become profitable by selling copious amounts of financial data including following multiple hops from your personal wallet.  Their super maleware cookies are no joke either.
