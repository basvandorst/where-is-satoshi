To most people it's jealousy bro 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:53:16
You should be ok .. people are getting scared for putting in more money than they could afford to lose and the ones who wanted the quick cash ..
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:56:22
Dumb question

Thanks for the honest comment 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:00:57
So I can transfer my eth/btc or whatever to Gemini and then sell there right ? Then I should be able to transfer from there ? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:46:37
The only ones getting depressed are the new guys 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:57:39
Well the reason why I think some people will keep their money in bitcoin is because some people don't even know how to buy Alts .. and even when they do they usually sell for bitcoin .. also a lot of these new guys have these crazy imaginations that bitcoin will reach 100K and thus making people pour in a lot more money in this .. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:45:53
Cringe 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:43:17
Do these debit cards actually work everywhere ? And is it better than switching your bitcoin to gdax ? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:02:46
Biggest noob question I've seen in awhile ..
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:27:03
Do you know if Gemini works fine and works just as fast as gdax ? Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:51:34
And why don't you think that this is just the beginning ? I myself believe too that this is too good to be true, there are who knows how many people making REAL money and lots of it .. but I think this is the beginning of it's rise .. I think it can easily reach 40-50K before it crashes and eventually does stabilizes ..

The thing is this coin ripple .. and I'm sure everyone knows how they feel about ripple ..
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:26:26
For reals ..
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:12:37
Should I use gdax or Gemini ? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:53:32

@_date: 2017-12-20 03:57:46
I already been verified on coinbase .. I've been on this since September .. I just haven't ever cashed out .. what is usually the fastest way to cash out ? Wire or regular deposit ? Idk If im making sense here ..
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:40:20
Me personally I've been in the game for a some months now and I haven't had my bit coin or Alts stolen .. I do have some in a wallet just not everything because I think 1. it lags to transfers sometimes 2. After awhile the fees add up . 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:29:00
well I'm a big fan of Ark and Vert and Stratis , have been making profits with them so I'm thinking of losing ripple for one of these with these pullbacks ..

Most people here will tell you to not keep your bitcoin or Alts in a exchange .. Me personally I've been in the game for some months now .. Made my last 150$ go to 800 ( not much .. made some mistakes but profit regardless ) And I have never been hacked, or lost .. knock on wood �� but I'll tell you this , maybe have a percentage of your coin in an exchange so you can trade if that's your game plan or put in a wallet if you really want to be safe about it but try not to always switch over and over , I think the fees add up after awhile and the transactions  tend to lag .. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:08:14
It's funny of how many broke college students got in on this .. I myself am also a broke college but been in since When it was at 5K .. I took my last 150 dollars and got it up to 650 ( with multiple mistakes ) recently went down a bit since a lot of my holdings are in Alts .. but I'm not worried they will eventually go back up . Good luck . 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:44:45
So what you are trying to say is that this all too good to be true .. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:14:20
How do you mine ? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:00:17
Are you sure it's a btc address that you are copying in ? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:53:10
Don't say trade on coinbase , me personally I like Bittrex 
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:04:59
Well if you use a credit card or debit card and purchase with that instead it takes a couple seconds maybe even instantly . With that though , you send whatever amount you purchased to a wallet or to an exchange 
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:10:57
Most people use coin base bro 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:34:57
I'm thinking it will get to 8,100 - 8,300 then it will dip big time . But what makes it difficult to know for sure is if it does pass 8,000 maybe new people will get in from the news . The real question is which Alts to get in for when the drop comes . 
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:49:40
6% on mine 
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:54:00
NEVERMINd spoke too soon , it was in the 300 hundreds in 2014 so you dun goofed 
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:58:24
You most likely aren't giving the right key 
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:25:53
It's the fees bro
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:27:10
Take this from someone who is almost going to turn 20 , and that also has debt ( not as much you but debt lol ) I advice you to learn as much as you can , and take the profits from Alts , and Btc , make it almost a part time trader maybe if you do t have the time . And try to pay off your debts like that . Or go all in and don't look back . 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:36:18
I'm thinking of getting some more ripple too 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:38:34
My apologies ! I'll move over there , thanks . 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:27:44
I love Casey 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:52:27
I'm think 4,900 - 5,000 
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:52:22
You can pretty much go on vacation 
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:53:35
I think it's just going to stabilize 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:36:20
Of course this is just opinion. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:20:33
Let's do it
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:19:41
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:50:46
Send it from gdax 
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:02:35
Yes at the beginning not knowing better the fees would kill me but card is better if you aren't buying a big amount all at one time 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:12:50
4,800 is possible of course but greed is sinful . 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:43:39
I'm thinking 4,900 - 5,000 from my " analysis "  feel free to check out my post. Let me know why you guys think . 
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:23:12
Did you get hacked ? Or lost it in transaction ? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:58:53
I'm guessing you buy " your " bitcoin thru coinbase and wait 4-5 days for it to actually get there ? 
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:56:28
Of course why wouldn't it be , it's all live and the transactions take a couple seconds 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:37:20
Yes , maybe 5,000 will be the lowest it will go for this correction . 
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:52:08
A shit ton bro
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:27:42
I use exodus , is the reason why you switched wallets because of the fees ? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:36:07
There might be a small bounce no doubt about it but I think it can easily still dip , the dust hasn't settled yet .
