With great power comes great responsibility. A "normal bank" restricts how, where and when you use your own money. Government and banking are so tightly intertwined now that Your ability express yourself freely can be threatened with the flip of a switch, think Wikileaks. The only reason Wikileaks exits today is because of Bitcoin. All other payment options were cut off (Credit cards, paypal, etc.). We all need money to survive, money is freedom and with the ability of banks/government to simply cut you out of the financial system because they don't like what you say or who you are associated with, are you really free? With Bitcoin you truly are.

Fees are low as hell. Try sending $10k overseas via western union or swift. BTC is way cheaper. Yeah, sending $10 dollars may not be as economical but lighting network will handle that.

The point is, you cannot stop Bitcoin itself. You can declare it illegal, ban it, do whatever, you cannot stop it. Also, you can trade Bitcoin for cash in person. As long as people are willing to accept Bitcoin, you don't need banks. Banks do make it a lot easier to buy it, but they are not necessary.

All these "hodlers" get really upset when you tell them Bitcoin might retest past resistances as support, let alone break the supports. This bear market may not be over. Right now all we've had is a golden retrace.  We could very well end up testing 4500 as support or possibly even breaking it to test new lows. Anyone who denies that as a possibility has no business buying bitcoin, let alone trading it. Emotions have no place in successful investing and/or trading. You have to be prepared for any possible outcome.

I get what you're saying, point taken. I was just trying to illustrate the point that when trading markets, it's literally, mathematically a zero sum game.

Yes, both are equally happy at the time of the transaction. A day, week, month, year later, one person is happy, the other is not. One gained exactly what the other lost = zero sum.

Answer me this: Why is it that you guys complain and cry "manipulation" when the price falls, but say it's "organic" when it goes up? This is what a free market is. Big players can move the market, so what? There's no conspiracy here. If you want to maximize your returns, learn it, and use it to your advantage instead of complaining about it and losing money. If you're holding for the long term, these day to day, week to week fluctuations shouldn't matter to you anyway.
@_date: 2018-05-27 22:15:38
Then you shouldn't matter-of-factly say "crypto will fail". Crypto *may* fail, would be more appropriate.

I can't say I've ever checked my portfolio in the middle of the night but I have had crypto dreams. I had a dream last night that Bitcoin plunged to $2400, so I was in a mad panic to buy as much as I could. I buy like $10000 worth and feel satisfied for a moment until I realize I bought Waves instead (WTF? I don't even hold or trade waves in real life). I go to sell waves and it had plunged while Bitcoin had soared to $10000. I woke up practically in a cold sweat!
@_date: 2018-05-25 21:47:32
It can. Example: Owning a load of a shitcoin that's being traded at 1 btc volume per day. Just because your Blockfolio says you have $1000000 in Shitcoin value, doesn't mean you actually have that because as soon as you start to sell you'll clear out the order books and tank the price after you try to sell the first $10000 worth. That's why the market price of BTC is more accurate than the market price of any other alt due to the sheer trade volume. You know that even if you have 10 million in BTC, you'll be able to sell it for at or near that price.

Large bitcoin mining operations are generally set up where there is a large surplus of cheap, renewable sources of electricity (See Geothermal power in Iceland, Hydroelectric power in China, Canada, and Northwest U.S.). This energy would otherwise be "wasted" if not for use in mining. I cannot possibly explain it any better than it is explained in [this video](

XBT has to do with international currency naming convention standards [(iso 4217)]( "X" currencies are supranational currencies like XAU = Gold, XPT = Platinum. Now, cryptocurrencies have no specific naming convention because they're not recognized by law as currencies, so BTC or XBT are equally relevant but most people recognize BTC over XBT, so BTC is used more often. But, in the future, if Bitcoin is recognized as a legitimate supranational currency, it's ticker symbol will officially be "XBT".

A good store of value needs to appreciate at the rate of inflation or better. Bitcoin does this in spades despite it's short term volatility.
@_date: 2018-05-18 18:36:14

So the reality is, YOU don't know what bitcoin is because you refuse to learn.
@_date: 2018-05-18 18:34:22
Well, the more mining there is, the more it incentivizes the building of renewable energy production facilities. When hydroeletric projects can be paid off in years rather than decades, we get more hydroelectric power, which means less coal, natural gas, and oil based power. Power production/consumption is not the problem, it's the way in which we produce a lot of it currently (via carbon based fuels) that is a problem.
@_date: 2018-05-18 17:52:24
Instead of wasting my time writing a 10000 word essay for you here and now, I referred you to a great book to learn all that you need to know about Bitcoin. However, it seems you've already made up your mind.

Are you for real? First of all, sales tax is actually a fair tax, in that it's mostly a voluntary tax (usually food staples are tax exempt). Income tax is involuntary, you HAVE to pay it or you go to prison. Secondly, the idea that nobody "works hard enough" to produce $10m in value is preposterous. How do you define WORK and HARD? Just because Billy Bob digs ditches for 14 hours a day and physically works HARDER than say Jeff Bezos, doesn't mean he creates anywhere near the value Jeff Bezos does. You sound like a naive socialist who doesn't understand basic economics.

Don't fret. It's certainly within the realm of possibility that you may get a chance to buy in cheaper than you sold (assuming you sold at $4000).
@_date: 2019-08-19 18:26:42
This is correct. Shorting, especially in a volatile asset like Bitcoin, actually causes the opposite effect than most would expect. It drives the price up due to cascades of shorts being forced to close during massive buys (aka. Short squeeze). Most of this most recent run up was actually powered by over leveraged shorts on Bitfinex. If it wasn't for Bitcoin derivatives products that can be shorted with leverage, I would argue bitcoin would not be valued even close to what it is today.

There aren't a lot of cash transactions compared to card, so card users are picking up most of the bill anyway.

Interesting but very limited data considering localbitcoins makes up a fairly small percentage of the overall BTC market volume. I'd like to see something similar done with say ten of the largest exchanges.
@_date: 2019-04-03 19:09:32
After accumulation down below 4000, the supply was finally exhausted at 4200. Little to no resistance above 4200 to 5000 meant that the price surged on relatively little volume. This was pretty much expected as we're now at a Common 0.618 retrace zone. I don't believe the bear market is over quite yet.

That's not what he was sentenced for though. He cannot be held responsible for any deaths associated with the drugs sold on the Silk Road. It's the same reason why gun manufacturers and dealers cannot be held responsible for deaths caused by the guns they sell. He was put away for doing nothing more than aiding and abetting the sale and distribution of drugs on a large scale. The government was just setting an example with his sentence. Which is laughable as there are more online drug markets now than ever before.

It's the only reason I'm still mining right now (I mine Ethereum with two GPU rigs and various equihash coins with an ASIC that I auto convert to BTC on the fly at Miningpoolhub). I'm currently nearing break even if I factor electricity costs, however, because I'm heating my basement with my miners, my electric baseboard heaters are not cutting in and so it works out that it costs me nothing more to run the miners all fall/winter than it does to run the heaters, in effect, giving me free electricity to run the miners. I will sell everything in the spring unless a miracle happens and it becomes profitable to mine once again.
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:24:28
I'm a GPU miner who converts many of the shitcoins I mine into BTC. You could say that I'm indirectly mining BTC with GPUs. So maybe originrobot is referring to guys like me :)

It's even more likely that it hasn't. The long term trend is still very bearish with consistently lower highs and lower lows. I wouldn't be surprised to see sub $5000 within the next few months.

Man, when will this end. You cannot, over the long term, "suppress" the price of bitcoin (or any other asset) by short selling. In fact, excessive short selling does just the opposite opening up the asset for massive short squeezes. The only thing that can bring the value of bitcoin down is a lack of demand.

Either way, a short squeeze is not necessarily the result of market manipulation. They happen in traditional markets as well.

BTC is and always will be the OG of Crypto and will go down in the history books. Do not underestimate it.
Some stats to demonstrate the sheer magnitude of energy behind securing the Bitcoin blockchain.
* Bitcoin's current estimated annual electricity consumption = 60,510 GWh 
* Annualized global mining revenues = $5,794,734,162 USD
* Annualized estimated global mining costs= $3,025,589,467 USD
* Number of U.S. households that could be powered by Bitcoin = 5,602,943
* Bitcoin's electricity consumption as a percentage of the world's electricity consumption = 0.27%
No other crypto comes close in terms of network effect and current use.

If you really believe that, then you don't understand (or care to understand) his position. He was simply against a Canadian bill that compels certain pronouns. The bill makes it illegal to refuse to call someone by their preferred pronoun. He doesn't have a problem referring to people by their preferred pronoun, but he does have a problem with it being compelled and enforced by law. I totally support that position.
