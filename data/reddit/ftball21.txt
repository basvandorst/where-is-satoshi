what if i told you the value will go back up

It is real currency if you and everyone using it believe it is. Dollars aren't any more real than bitcoin. Just more people accept dollars than bitcoin.

100% serious question
what makes you say that?
$2000 btc price seems reasonable to me
possible btc: ~21 million (i think?)
usd in circulation: ~11 trillion (overall money, not just physical cash)
that comes out to a little more than 500k per btc. i doubt btc would even go to 10% of that value but $2000 seems, at least *reasonable*
most likely a bubble in the foreseeable future but definitely not long term
and obviously scaling is the long term issue but if history is any indicator, humans adapt well to new technologies
but i don't really know wtf im talking about.. just throwing out a thought
