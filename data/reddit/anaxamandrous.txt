But elsewhere it was suggested that we just switch to using mBTC as the standard unit.  Does this not create potential for the same confusion?  Yet nobody seems to be too panicked about it.
Naturally, a split like I suggest would be something you'd want known well in advance.  Something that would not take anyone by surprise.  The folks who have wallets displaying purchasing power equivalence in a selected fiat currency would see no difference anyway . . . one might go, for example, from owning 10 BTC worth $750 each to owning 10,000 BTC worth $.75 each, either way a grand total of $7,500.00.

Indeed, it seems a 1 in a million shot, but worth the OP asking Coinbase to check.  More likely, it will have been a very expensive lesson in security.  I do wish Coinbase would encourage people to use their hosted wallets for immediate use coins and small amounts only, the rest to be stored offline.  I doubt they ever will do that, though.

BTC can be split down to 1/100 millionth of 1 BTC.  Exchanges and brokers set their own limits, but in no case should you have to buy a whole BTC.
@_date: 2014-02-26 09:05:17
I am ok with this rate, though of course lower would be better.  What I really don't like is the rate to buy BTC from someone like Coinbase.  1% mark up.  This makes it more expensive to use than credit cards in most cases, except of course where the seller gives a BTC discount.  I would love to see this number cut to .1%.

That Litecoins can still be mined by mortals mainly results from the fact that scrypt is more memory intenstive than SHA-256 and is less easily performed on ASICs.  Lack of popularity may also play a role, but the algorithm itself makes Litecoin more "everyday Joe" mineable than Bitcoin is.

There were a few items specified about Bitcoin that would either require unanimous agreement of the community or that could never be changed without it ceasing to be Bitcoin any more.  The hard limit on the number of coins was one of these items, because without that limit BTC potentially becomes inflationary just like the fiat it seeks to replace.
This is not to say a majority couldn't do it by force anyway.  They could the same as some folks like to ignore the Constitution sometimes.  But in the case of Bitcoin, they would lose more from loss of confidence in the community than they would gain in new coins.

As you have no ATMs or sellers near you, the best I can come up with is for you to write a check to a trusted person -- close friend or family member -- who is close to a seller.  Have them cash the check, then take the cash to meet the seller and purchase the Bitcoin.  For all the bank or anyone else knows, they could have used the cash to buy bubble gum and cat food -- it's nobody's business but yours anyway.
If you don't have a trusted person near a seller or ATM, I honestly am out of ideas.

I am afraid payroll is going to be a beast in terms of widespread adoption.  I am not as convinced as sqig that it will never happen, but any employment agreement denominated in BTC results in a wage that can fluctuate (dramatically in the current environment) from one day or week to the next.  This is fine for the employer in terms of making payment; as long as they hold enough BTC to cover net pay, that part is well in hand.  But when they want to calculate taxes, Social Security withholding, etc., based on gross pay, they have to convert these things to USD because the relevant agencies will not accept payment in BTC.  So it just introduces an extra element of risk, pretty much the same as foreign exchange, into the business's outlook.
On the other hand, the same business could tell the employee, "take your USD and buy BTC or whatever else you want with it, but we are paying in USD."  For now, I think most businesses will take this latter route.
But as I mentioned in another post, there are countries in the world where the legal currency is not the most important currency.  Where I live right now, for example, every piece of real estate for sale is priced in USD.  Payment probably has to be made in the local currency by law, but the conversion is done at time of sale.  So BTC could begin to make inroads into the domain of the dollar in the same way over the years.

1)  BTC mining becomes less profitable
2)  Miners stop mining as much
3)  Difficulty drops
4)  Profit spikes for miners still in
5)  Miners come back in
And so on.  It seems to be a self-righting system all the way through to the last coin.  But as others have mentioned, tiny transaction fees times many transactions will keep the thing profitable for those miners long after the last new BTC is mined.  Indefinitely.

Has to be Gox itself, I agree, if the correlation between these buys and sells is more than sheer coincidence.  Gox will surely allow itself to withdraw BTC whereas it is not allowing anyone else to do so.  Like a new Enron.

I think so.  Weird to consider that even low barriers to entry can keep the masses out.  Here one such low barrier is finding a trustworthy BTC vendor and setting up the account with them.  Ebay is preparing to give a lot of people a way around this barrier, a way of arranging transactions with folks who have already gone to the next step.  That means many more potential buyers of BTC.
Meanwhile it appears that the pace at which retailers add BTC to their payment options is only increasing.
It's as though the thing reached critical mass late last year and is now supercritical.  Even China could not keep it down long.
If BTC disappoints me, it will not be the first investment to do so.  But I am convinced it will take a little while to recover the confidence China destroyed, and then it should rise a while again.

One issue is that the courts have provided a lot of incentive to divorce for the woman.  I do not know any case where the court was so much as even-handed about the kids, let alone favored the man.  So the woman divorces him (and statistically it is far more often the woman who initiates divorce) and it goes one of two ways.
1)  The man is the family's breadwinner.  The court says, "Man, you are at work all the time.  You cannot provide enough time and attention to your kids during the week, so you can have visitation every other week.  Your ex-wife gets them the rest of the time.  She will need the house for the kids' sake, and she will need your paycheck also . . ."
2)  The woman is the family's breadwinner.  The court says, "Man, you have contributed next to nothing to the family.  Leave.  Take half the assets, but leave the kids and the house.  If you get a job, give the paycheck to your ex-wife."
Hell, I hate celebrity gossip, but I accidentally ran across an article a long time ago talking about how Demi Moore might well take Ashton Kucher to the cleaners.

I'm afraid it would take a majority of miners at least to accept such a split.  Not likely to happen anytime soon if at all.

I don't think you understood at all.  When a person sets up accounts online involved in monetary transactions, they often want to know your address among other things.  So if your address is in Texas and your bank account is in Paris because you moved, this can get you red-flagged.  I know iTunes does similar, except there they discriminate by IP address location.
Anyway BTC may help bypass local laws, but that is just incidental.  What is important is that you'll never have issues with bank address versus registered address with BTC.  It ceases to come into play at all.

Coinbase coins are in line with the market.  Gox coins are inexpensive because the market is factoring in the fact you cannot withdraw them now and the possibility Gox will belly up and take a ton of BTC with it (to be sold quietly later).

Herd mentality.  Drop in price means the sellers are dominating at that moment, so a ton of quasi-conscious investors do the same.  And in fairness, bots written to try and trade momentum will also sell then, so this drives the price down rapidly.  The neat thing is that it seems to me almost always to overreact even to legitimately bad news.
Case in point, my options portfolio lost over 9% of its value in a single day early this week.  I did not sell.  The next day it recovered about 4.5% and the next couple days it continued to recover some.  I am still not up to where I would have been if I sold before the drop, but I am way higher than I would be if I had sold at any time after the first few minutes of that drop.
Panic selling is a bad habit, and a very expensive one to maintain.  The beauty of it is that it tends to shift wealth from other folks to folks like me.

The comment about deleting it was just me being a wise guy.  It's already encrypted, but this has no effect on the likelihood of my being hit with taxes on it.  I say this because, as long as I do not use or sell BTC, I legally owe no taxes on those BTC no matter how valuable they become.  The gains remain unrealized in that case.  But if the thing is encrypted and I use the encryption password to spend or sell BTC, or if it is not encrypted and I spend or sell BTC, then in any of those cases I have realized gains and will owe taxes.
My personal guess on this is that for the first few years it will be extremely easy to dodge taxes with BTC.  Later, the IRS will start requiring records from banks and exchanges that help them to build cases, and they will hammer some folks for 2013 or 2014 taxes in 2016, long after the individuals involved thought they'd gotten away with something.
Or maybe I am just paranoid.  But I know what I am going to do.  I am planning to report my gains as diligently as I am able.  Hard to put a price on the ability to sleep well at night.

People have already addressed some concerns with your calculations.  But on the bright side, I could very easily see gas stations giving some level of discount for this.  It frees up the sales clerk for snack food sales, virtually eliminates the possibility of accidental over/under charge, and still yields cash in the gas station's hands instantly, unlike credit cards.  They already provide a cash discount, so a BTC discount doesn't seem too far fetched.  I would not count on 5% though.  1% tops, I imagine.

I agree 100% about the importance of unit size.  It is meaningless in terms of percentage ownership or in terms of purchasing power, but if a person doesn't learn to take basic human nature into account, investing may not be his or her calling.  My first post on Redditt was to express my belief that Bitcoin should be split.  That was pretty soundly shot down, and I have since learned that the ~21 million coin limit is pretty much an axiom of Bitcoin, not something Satoshi intended be changeable by simple majority decision.  Therefore, your suggestion that the standard unit be micro bitcoin (I don't know how to make the symbol) is something with which I totally agree.

If they allow a person to convert BTC to Amazon coin, they ARE accepting BTC in their capacity as an exchange.  I agree with anaccountjustforyou that this is useless complexity.  Amazon will benefit directly in lower fees and no charge backs by accepting Bitcoin.  I cannot think of a good reason for them not to do so.

If I owned a major online retailer and saved 2% of gross sales (as an example) on BTC orders versus CC orders, I would absolutely offer either discounts or store credit or something in the 1% of purchase price range to customers using BTC.  The beauty of this number is that it exactly offsets the customer's expenses buying the required BTC from Coinbase, but still yields the seller more earnings per unit sale than CC transactions do.

You're confusing yourself.  Stocks do not lose interested buyers because the price falls.  The price falls because the stock sucks and has therefore lost interested buyers.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, is still (I believe) a solid basis for a stateless currency.  This has not changed from 2 and 3 months ago.  Less buyers may or may not result from falling prices.  Surely falling prices scare momentum investors away, but they attract fundamentals investors.  The running momentum investors are winning, of course, or the price would not keep falling, but they will not keep winning all the way to $0.00.  Even now the price has stabilized a bit waiting on more news, good or bad.
As for the number of possible buyers, we have barely scratched the surface yet.  What are there, a few million wallets with non-zero balance?  Even if there were not an average of multiple wallets per person invested, there are 7 billion people in the world.  If 1% of them enters the world of Bitcoin, that is 70 million people invested to some degree in BTC.  We are not even close to that point yet, and who's to say we'll get stuck even at 1%?
I am not cashing out now, and I do not plan to for a long time yet.  I will spend BTC as things I want are sold for BTC, but I will replenish my supply immediately after the purchase anyway.  I am confident this will not go bust.  If it does, so be it, but I think it will not.

I know this, but my goal in the proposal was to make the thing more apparently affordable / accessible to folks looking at BTC for the first time.
When I first considered getting into BTC around $200, one of the very first questions that came to mind was whether it was possible to own fractions of a BTC.  I did a small amount of looking around and learned that it was indeed possible to divide BTC as far as anyone should really care to.  Anyway, it was only academic interest on my part -- I am better able to afford the investment than some folks considering it might be able to do.  I eventually bought in much higher than $200 per, but that's another story.
My concern is about the guy or gal who looks at BTC @ $750 each and immediately retreats, never taking the time to learn it was possible to invest less than this amount and come out with a fraction of a BTC.  To the extent splitting BTC may help convert folks with such casual interest into fellow BTC investors, I think it is worth considering.

Market orders mean "buy X number of BTC at any price" so they will execute faster than limit orders in many cases.  The down side is that you relinquish control of the price you are willing to buy at.
Market orders can be best if there are a lot of orders on the order book (sell side) near the current trade price but the price is moving rapidly.  The large number of orders on the order book will protect you from accidentally buying all of the coin near the current price and buying the last coins in your order far above the current price.  It also ensures you will get your order filled where the limit order may be set one Satoshi lower than the lowest sell order and miss being filled.
But for most trades, limit orders are better.  If you set a limit order right at the current price, as often as not it will fill within seconds.

Yes, it is very similar.  Splitting BTC would make more of them but make them proportionally worth less.  Going the mBTC route achieves the same result as long as the public can be transitioned to think in terms of mBTC rather than BTC . . . and then when BTC appreciates in value 100x from here (if it ever does) maybe looking at microBTC as the standard unit.  Splitting covers all of the transition in a single pass.  So yeah, splitting and mBTC are just two different routes to the same goal.

All I can say about my own, decidedly non-professional, estimates on future value of Bitcoin is to try to guess what percentage of all relevant financial events (retail sales, supply chain transactions, personal savings, cash on balance sheets, etc.) might be denominated in Bitcoin at that given point in the future.  Then multiply this percentage of all such events times the estimated global GDP at that same point in the future to get an estimate on the fiat value of the total pool of BTC in circulation.  Finally, divide this number by the estimated number of BTC that will be in circulation at that time.  This number cannot be more than 21,000,000 ever, but it can be less in the near term primarily because of coins not yet mined, less in the long term primarily because of lost wallets and coins permanently orphaned.
Admittedly, my system is not going to be very accurate even if all my estimates were right because GDP is not intended to provide any data on money lying dormant in savings accounts and balance sheets, etc.  Also, when using GDP, it is important to consider that a single dollar in circulation could be earned numerous times in a year, resulting in a large disparity between dollars in circulation and gross domestic product in dollars.  It is my hope that these two inaccuracies largely offset one another and that I land somewhere in the ballpark.  But I just don't know.
As an example, if we assumed 1% of all global wealth were denominated in BTC right now, then my system of thought might be to say that the gross world product is a bit over $70 trillion in nominal dollars now.  Therefore BTC might account for $700 billion of that economy.  Assuming a couple million of the currently mined BTC are lost for good already and that the total currently available BTC is 10 million BTC, we would be looking at $70,000 per BTC.
Bear in mind that 1% of the global economy is far, far away from where we are now and perhaps from where we will ever be.  A person has to just give this number his or her best guess and hope it's right.
Surely there are better models for predicting future value than this, but it's the way I try to ballpark what are reasonable (however unlikely) possibilities versus what are ridiculous pie in the sky dreams.

A provably fair game of chance is one where the virtual dice, wheel, cards, or whatever are provably as random as an astute player should understand them to be.  Toss a virtual die and have it come up 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 each 1/5th of the time, never 6, and this die (and any game played with it) is provably unfair.  It has nothing to do with letting the player win as much as he loses, as if the casino were some sort of non-profit or something.  Put another way, if the casino publishes odds of winning a certain prize, they might prove fairness by showing the results of many tries over the years, the aggregate of which very closely approximate the percentage chance of winning stated.
However, if they can only show that, for example, any 1-in-20 chance as stated on their website was indeed a 1-in-20 chance, completely beyond the power of the casino to manipulate, then this also makes the game provably fair.  It is irrelevant whether the casino paid out 19 to 1 on the 1 in 20 chance win, or if they paid only 10 to 1, or if they acted like a charity and paid 20 to 1 until operating costs made them go broke.  All possible payouts are provably fair as long as the odds of a win were random beyond the power of the casino to manipulate and as long as the payouts were in accordance with what the casino listed for such wins.
Try Googling "provably fair".  You will see better explanations than mine about what it is.  You will even see, probably as your  result, a website named provablyfair.org that purports to check websites and confirm that they are indeed playing in a provably fair way.  The entire community seems to understand the usage of the term in a different way than the OP does.

Sadly, I think you are pretty much on track here.  I honestly expect any day in the coming couple of months for Mt. Gox to simply vanish.  And the media will go bananas over it for a little while in order to ensure they get cheaper loans from fiat banks when they need them.
What Bitcoin needs to offset some of this crap is a heavyweight on their side.  When the big push came to curtail smoking pretty much everywhere, the tobacco industry was pitted against, among others, the insurance industry.  Ali-Foreman right there.  But with Bitcoin so far, all the heavyweights are on the side of fiat.  I really wish Google would make a move already.

In my former home state (I left the USA for work 15 years ago and have not returned yet) the favored false allegation was and still seems to be of physical non-sexual abuse of the woman.  There, too, the law and the courts will always err on the side of caution; the man goes to jail automatically as soon as the accusation is made, and the courts will take custody of the children from him.  No consequence for the woman or the lawyer who coaches her to do it when (if) all is revealed to be a lie.
In a broader criticism of this bias in law, you all remember the infamous la crosse team rape case?  It was prison time on conviction for a handful of those university boys . . . but they finally learned that the allegation was 100% fabricated.  The prosecutor was disbarred and I think even imprisoned for prosecutorial misconduct.  The woman who set the whole thing in motion with the allegation she absolutely knew was false?  Nothing happened to her at all as far as I know.  She's just out there waiting for another victim, another man whose life she can ruin with the same false allegation.
The situation really needs to be overhauled, but as it has been broken like this since I was a young teen and my own family went through it in divorce court, I don't imagine a fix is coming any time soon.

It would be interesting to read a "crash after 31 January" theory that made sense.  You think the whole world is full of people who cannot see that, when China pulls out, it will all collapse, but you alone can see it?  Wrong.  What China has done and will likely do has been factored into the price.  In fact, I believe it has been factored in too strongly because of bashers crying doom.  When 31 January comes and goes, and people look around and say to themselves, "in fact, the sky did not fall," there will likely be a run of buying, not of selling.
Edit:  I wanted also to mention that those in China who were getting out would have known that a rush to sell on the last day would drive prices down and that they, therefore, would get less for their BTC by waiting.  They did not wait.  Think of a burning theater.  Who in the world would have waited until the last minute before it all was aflame?  They hit the doors the moment someone shouted "fire!"

In RSA the encryption key would consist of the number pair e and n.  The decryption key is the number pair d and n, of which only d has to be kept secret.  Generating these number pairs, you use the totient of n, and this number must be kept secret also.  In fact it should be destroyed because it's no longer needed once the keypair is made.
I know it flies in the face of common sense, but there are math operations that can be verified much more easily than they can be performed.  This is a super trivial example and does not replicate RSA at all, but it may help you understand the gist of this.
Let's say I told you to guess a number between 1 and 100 and I would give you a dollar if you guessed right, you give me 10 cents if you guess wrong.
Well you might refuse saying that I will just change the number every time to make your guess wrong.
So I can tell you this.  The number I selected is congruent to 2 modulo 17, and it is congruent to 11 modulo 19.  Can you use this information to find the number I gave you?  Maybe so, which makes this simple demo imperfect, but you maybe get the idea.  Your best way of finding the secret number is still trial and error.  Then when the game is over and I tell you my secret number was 87, you see how much easier it is to find the modulus from the secret number (confirm the secret) than it was to go the other way, finding the secret number based on a couple modulus outputs.
RSA's math contains no known weaknesses that can be practically exploited, and instead of a number between 1 and 100 it uses numbers hundreds of digits long.
Elliptic curve, which Bitcoin uses for digital signatures, is considered to be as secure as RSA and doesn't need numbers quite as large to achieve that security.

It is not possible for us to mine all the coins before 2040 or thereabouts.  The changing difficulty guarantees this.
Say it took 1 unit of work to mine enough to average 1 BTC reward.  Then if the system wants 1000 BTC paid out a week (just as an example) it will keep the difficulty the same as long as 1000 units of work are being done per week.  If a bunch of ASICs come into the system -- as they have done -- and the collective efforts of all participants yield 100,000 units of work a week, the system will make difficulty 100 times as high.  Now difficulty will not ever shift by more than a factor of 4 in any difficulty adjustment event (every 2 weeks), so it is theoretically possible everyone stops mining long enough for difficulty to drop to 2009 levels, then hit it with every ASIC in existence, and they'd finish the project before the next difficulty adjustment.  But this is, in reality, never going to happen.

I am just an investor, a user once local businesses start accepting BTC, and a CPU based miner for about 12 hours (would maybe get one Satoshi for that if the mining group paid out at such a low threshold).  So my opinion is probably not the most informed you'll get in answer to your question.
Disclaimer done, I will say I would steer well clear of it.  That is, I would not order an ASIC at all.  I would consider buying one where cash changes hands exactly when the ASIC does.  But the problem with ASICs is that they are wasting assets.  One is worth far less a year after purchase than the day of purchase because of the ever-increasing difficulty.  When you order one of these, the supplier has real financial rewards for every day they use it to mine rather than send it to you so you can mine.  If they can delay sending it to you for a mere 90 days, you might see your net lifetime revenues from the device cut in half or worse, and those revenues go to the supplier instead.
Imagine ordering tickets to the Superbowl online.  The supplier has delays getting them to you.  Finally, the tickets do arrive in the mail a couple days after the Superbowl is over.  And to add insult to injury, you somehow learn that the reason for the delay was that the seller used the tickets and watched the Superbowl in person before sending them to you.
I imagine not all ASIC sellers are scammers like this, but the risk is very high.  I would buy $2100 worth of BTC from a good exchange -- Coinbase for example -- instead if I were you.

I am a big believer in BTC, and I expect I will one day wish I had invested everything in BTC.  But as there is still uncertainty in it, as in every thing that has not yet happened, I maintain about 2/3 of my investment capital across a small but diverse selection of stocks and options.  The remaining 1/3 is split between BTC and LTC, about 50/50.  Because of the high positive correlation you mentioned, I don't consider my BTC/LTC split to be diversification at all, but rather sought diversification in those securities.

No, I'm not too concerned.  There are some very sharp crypto folks who neither work for the NSA nor even support them in the crap they've been pulling the past number of years.  Bruce Schenier is a famous example of this.  These folks have looked hard at the big algorithms, including SHA-256, and have not seen anything suspicious.
That is not to say there is nothing there.  The Snowden releases did indicate the NSA/RSA scheme for weakening random number generation (an important tool in some pieces of crypto, though not in hashing) critical aspects of which I imagine even the heavy hitters outside the NSA didn't suspect.  But I try to take comfort in that there are people looking for this sort of shenanigans, even if it could be that it exists and they've missed it.
Now as far as the NSA / RSA thing about weakening the generation of random numbers, I do worry just a touch about how this could impact the generation of public and private key pairs for wallets.  But there are other random number generation methods that are apparently much stronger.  I hope one of the stronger methods is being used here.

Yes, it certainly could.  But it was easy to identify the differences between MySpace and Facebook that favored the latter over the former.  What differences are there between Bitcoin and all other crypto coins that favor the latter?  Scrypt v. SHA-256?  Not important to the end user.  Built-in inflation for PPC?  This seems to me a disincentive to PPC.  NMC competes in its own special space and should do well, I think, but will not displace BTC.  So what can any new coin bring that will make BTC fail?
I realize that if you knew the answer to this, you would be able to make the coin and become wealthy.  But just contemplating it a few minutes, I think you will agree that BTC's weaknesses and much less glaring than MySpace's.

True about proof of work being something hard to do but easy to check.  The OP's suggestion meets this criterion very well.  The seti folks take a broad spectrum of electromagnetic transmissions picked up (preferably) from deep space by radio telescope.  They then slice these recordings into pieces by frequency and by date &amp; time / location of sky scanned.
The individual computer processing a given slice will perform a number of different operations on it, including fast Fourier transforms and a scan for irregular patterns in the signal (regular patterns are what one expects from non-sentient cosmic events).  Once the slice is completely processed, it is sent back to the seti headquarters where they do find it easy to confirm findings, and where they rank the value of a slice based on their own criteria, possibly including signal strength and frequency of apparently irregular signals.
Now, being a real-world situation, this is not the end of the story.  Seti will re-scan the sections of sky showing the most promise in previous scans.  But the results of any given scan are set in stone -- they can be replicated by any computer using the original data slice, and they can be very rapidly confirmed by any computer with the correct software as well.
TL;DR:  seti assigns individual computers on the network the very hard task of identifying patterns in radio signals in the presence of much background signal.  Confirmation is the relatively easy task of checking whether the identified pattern actually exists.  I think seti would be a fantastic proof of work for an alt coin.  I would mine them, and I would buy them.

I just cannot believe that his coffers ran completely dry before he noticed something was wrong.  I think he took a way out, flimsy though it is, and ran with it.  His lying about everything kind of supports that theory I think.  Actually, I suspect what really happened is that the double withdrawals were happening and he eventually detected them, but it was already too late -- he could never cover everyone if they withdrew at once.  So he just said, "fuck it" and robbed his own company worse than the original scammers did.
So he probably has less than the full 3/4 million BTC, but he probably has a lot of it.  The weird thing about his situation is that he is now exceedingly wealthy, but he can never fully enjoy it because he has a target on him and always will.

Amazingly, (52!), the number of different possible combinations of a well shuffled 52 card deck -- the same number you posted above -- holds a lot less entropy than a private key.
The private key will max out at 256 bits of entropy, not 260, so I will use 256 from here on.
The formula in Google to start with is this:  1/(52!/2^256)
It indicates that the 256 bit number contains 1,435,590,242.3 times the entropy as a shuffle of cards does.  But if you shuffle the cards again, that would yield (52!)^2 possible combinations, which is way more entropy than the 256 bit number.  A simple answer, then, is that 1 shuffle is not enough, but 2 shuffles is too many.
However, for fun, we can look for a factorial that, in place of 52, yields a result of as near 1 as we can get.  And it turns out that (57!) is as close as we can get.  That is to say that, if you added 5 more cards to the deck with their own unique values, shuffled them all, and then drew them in order, you would achieve just better than 1/4th the entropy of a 256 bit number.  Put another way, you would have just exceeded the entropy of a 254 bit number, and 2 flips of a coin would give you the last bit of entropy you needed.
Approached a different way, though, if we shuffled the 52 card deck and drew all the cards, then wanted to reduce the deck to a smaller subset of cards such that, by drawing all of those, we get the right amount of entropy, here is how to work that out.
We still start with 1/(52!/2^256) and get a subtotal of  1,435,590,242.3.  Now all we need to do is find the number, the factorial of which, is as near as we can find to 1,435,590,242.3.
1435590242.3/12! is roughly equal to 3.  This means that, if we shuffled a 52 card deck and recorded the order it was in, then shuffled 12 of those cards again and recorded the order they were in, we would have achieved about 1/3 the entropy of a 256 bit random number.  2 coin flips will again help you achieve max entropy as would simply drawing 13 cards instead of 12 on the second round with the cards.

Run from a rabid dog and you are begging him to bite you.  Go fetal position with a schoolyard bully, and it's going to go badly for you.  Most people know this on a personal level but cannot grasp it when it comes to geopolitics.
Let me put it plainly for you.  Putin will take everything there is if he can get it free or cheaply.  Cheaply in Georgia where he had to fight, but where the Russians had the overwhelming advantage from the start.  Free in Ukraine where his puppet kills innocents and thus ruins his own reputation while Putin retains plausible deniability.  If the West moves decisively on Ukraine, Putin will not send troops to fight against them, first because he cannot win that fight, second because in that case the prize for him is not worth the cost.

No.  I said 10%, meaning 10% of 60 billion, or $6 billion.  They are one of the biggest, but I would not expect even them to consume $60 billion.  That number -- $6 billion -- is not the set of transactions for a year.  It is the quantity of money that would be in transit through the supply chain at any given time, so a cycle much less than a year long.
But let me step away from that for now because it is too complex for the time I have right now, and because it calls for many, many assumptions and guesses to be made.  Let me just point out this.  Walmart's total annual revenue has been over $400 billion each year from 2010 through 2013.  Their cost of revenue has been over $300 billion each of those years.  That would be payroll, payments to suppliers, etc.  So we are talking about a business that averages well over $1.1 billion in sales per day and incurs just under $1 billion in expenses per day on those sales.
I think, if they begin to accept BTC for payments and begin to use them to pay their suppliers, that the customers will rapidly learn about BTC also.  If so, I imagine how you could see at least $6 billion worth of BTC accounted for in Walmart's accounts and the accounts of the suppliers they pay with BTC.  And then to consider how much BTC might sit in their customer's wallets, so to speak, for their next shopping trip . . .
It could never happen.  BTC could remain on the fringe.  But when you look at BTC versus credit cards, I really cannot think of any basis of comparison that favors the credit cards from the seller's point of view.
With credit cards, you face the risk of charge backs, you pay transaction fees, you have to store confidential credit card and other information on your customers to process the sales, you get your cash from the processor for credit card transactions in lump payments rather than in real time at the time of sale.  I just cannot imagine why Walmart would not move to BTC (which is easier to store and transport than even cash) and provide their customers financial incentive to make the switch as well.

The miners also confirm BTC transactions.  They are awarded a small fee for this, and the sender is the one who pays that fee.  It's about 7 or 8 cents, so no big issue for most folks to pay.  On the other hand, it provides incentive for people to continue to run the hardware that constitutes Bitcoin's distributed infrastructure even after all BTC have been mined in 2040.
Edit:  A small fee per send also prevents folks from spamming millions of tiny transactions and overloading the infrastructure.  This was apparently a real issue some period of time ago.

Nobody knows.  I think it is likely that it will begin a cycle of being bought, used to pay for things online, and sold back to fiat for a long time.  Eventually, I think fiat could be eliminated from the loop more and more, especially if big corporations decide to keep some BTC on the balance sheet rather than convert immediately.
Either way, it seems to me unlikely to vanish when the surge ends.  When a stock on the stock market has such a surge and the surge ends, the price might settle back a little from peak, but it does not dive again if fundamentals drove the original rise.  And there you have it; people who say it is a bubble will predict collapse, while people who say it is finding its correct valuation will say it will get to that valuation and then stay in that area.

40X would put it at $400 billion total value, roughly.  I think it is possible if adoption takes place on a very large scale.  It's very hard to say right now.  Depends on too much we do not know.  If more countries ban it, for example, the best outcome becomes less favorable than it was.  But yes, if all goes well, I think 40X is still possible in the next few years.

Start-up companies do not have price stability.  Neither should we expect Bitcoin to have during this period of high-speed growth.  The more widely adopted and distributed Bitcoin becomes, the more stable the exchange rate.
If you mean pinning it to an existing piece of fiat or basket of fiat, there are problems with that, including that it defeats the purpose of having non-fiat currency and that you cannot compel people to buy it at a fixed price if they think it is worth less.
Everything is still possible with Bitcoin.  It could be a fading memory in five years, or the news could be using it as the standard against which the fluctuations in the value of fiat are measured in ten years.  Only time will tell, but there is nothing about Bitcoin that makes it inherently unstable in terms of exchange rate, not counting the fact it is just gaining widespread acceptance now.
@_date: 2014-01-03 17:52:57
Oh man, what a bunch of hot air.  I am so tired of the "not a stable store of value because it fluctuates" argument.  May as well say the same of stocks, precious metals, real estate, etc., as they all fluctuate (some wildly).  The price of BTC relative to the major fiat currencies will stabilize as soon as a very broad base of people own them.  Then fluctuations in prices between BTC and fiat may be more a sign of price instability in the fiat than it is such a sign in BTC.
Either way, these folks remain -- I think intentionally -- ignorant of the fact that, as a newish system, BTC will necessarily fluctuate strongly as it finds its true value.  All new systems tend to do this.

I answered your post with the relevant details pertaining to an established, competing form of payment.  In other words, if this is your objection to Bitcoin, then I am suggesting you should also reject credit cards.  Maybe you are hinting that Zerocoin is the way you'd like to see things go?
If, on the other hand, this is not your objection to Bitcoin, why did you post it?
@_date: 2014-01-11 17:08:45
It is hard, and I am not sure that a person really should do so in every case.  In stocks, I'd typically set a trailing stop and let it ride.  I'd know I would not get off that ride at peak, but I could definitely get off near to peak except in the weird case some revelation outside trading hours craters the price before your trailing stop even gets to execute.
With options and BTC, I don't know if anyone offers trailing stops.  If they do, I would run the same program.  If they don't, I would just check in on the thing at least daily.  But I surely would not re-balance the portfolio at BTC's expense right now.
Of course, BTC could dive tomorrow and I will look like a fool for posting the above.  But I do embrace higher risk investments from time to time.  Did it with TSLA call options (probably the second best investment in all of 2013, right behind buying BTC) and it rewarded me well.  I rode that thing all the way up, only got out when the 3 fires made the price begin to plummet.

I don't believe in completely efficient markets.  I consider Buffett's refutation of the idea back in the 1980s to be about as convincing as anyone could want, that there will always be gaps between value and price (in either direction) for those who can find them.
But Bitcoin is not a stock.  Call it a currency or commodity, either way, the notion of "value" is completely different than with stocks.  With stocks, as Buffett has also been quoted to ask, if you could buy the whole company for share price times number of shares outstanding, would you?  If not, why would you buy any shares in it?  With commodities and currencies, the "value" comes in part precisely from other people owning some of it.  They have some and therefore have vested interest in seeing the whole thing continue.  And this works for all currencies, though the governments can more or less force people to use the currencies they issue.
But imagine if all USD belonged to one person and the USG did not back the greenback.  Doesn't it seem likely that everyone else would just say, "hey, let's forget those USD and make something else instead"?  Same with BTC.  If Satoshi had mined 99% of the BTC and then told everyone, "hey, come mine the rest," nobody would likely be interested.  But everyone who has BTC has a vested interest in seeing it succeed.  And I do not mean just in the sense of finding a "bigger fool" as if that were what this is about.  What BTC holders want is more adopters to spend their BTC with, to receive BTC as payments for their goods or services, and so forth.  The speculation will eventually dry up.  I imagine it did on the Euro, too, after the Euro went from about .90 USD to about 1.35 USD.  But people still do use the Euro.  This is the hope for BTC as well.

I agree about pegging currency not being a good idea.  I mentioned Argentina because I think the pegged currency has similarities of what less prosperous economies would be up against with widespread adoption of BTC.  I guess a better example could be EUR.  Germany and France seem to be happy enough, but some of the less robust economies in the EU were, so I understood, put under some strain by it.  I may be wrong on this though.  Anyway the point was that, when governments rack up huge debt, they have always previously been able to choose between default and simply printing more of their currency to repay the debt with massively deflated notes.  If their economy is on a BTC standard, the second option disappears.  Not saying it is necessarily a bad thing, but it is something they should be careful about.
As to the effects of a strong currency on exports, I think it's just a matter of the exchange rate almost acting like a tariff, which, if high enough, can hinder trade.  Say the USD is weak and the EUR strong.  In that case, goods made in the USA (the labor and materials paid in USD at a fixed rate) will cost less in terms of EUR than if the USD price remained constant but the USD was, itself, stronger.
Now of course, this is not the only way to set prices.  They could just change the price tag.  But imagine a business with a very narrow profit margin, say 1% on domestic sales.  Disregarding cost of shipping and customs, etc., let's say that the same item was getting a 1% profit margin in some foreign market also.  Now what if the manufacturer's home nation's currency strengthened against the customer nation's currency 2%?  Then any subsequent sales in that market would suddenly be at a net loss to the manufacturer even though the price tag never changed.  It's all more complicated than this with many more players, but I think this captures the essence of it.
But where I was talking about governments using inflation / currency devaluation was about debt repayment.  Take the USA, for example.  The national debt is enormous and is in large part in the form of savings bonds.  Those things might sell for, as an example, $900 each with a guaranteed repayment at maturity of $1000.  But if the government cannot repay the bond at maturity, then it has the power to print a ton of USD and just repay it anyway.  This is sickening for the bond holder of course, and governments should never do this.  But I just point out that they would not even have this option if they were running on BTC.
Oh going back to the exchange rate's impact on exports . . . yeah, if both economies (importer and exporter) were using BTC as their de facto currency, then I agree with you, the exporter just puts their price on there, as low as they want it to be, and foreign exchange effects would never come into play since it was the same currency on both ends of the process (in the cost of manufacture and in the proceeds from sale).
So man I typed a lot and all I think I ended up doing was agreeing with you in a very long-winded way.  Haha!  Sorry for that . . .

There are sets of numbers, call them e, d, and n, that can easily be generated such that if we have another number representing a plaintext message -- call that number m -- the following is true.
(m^e) mod n = cyphertext C
(c^d) mod n = plaintext m again
Now these numbers have another important property.  You can publish n, e, plus many m and c pairs for that n, e, d key set, and you still cannot calculate d in any known way that is likely to succeed in our lifetimes.  Well, quantum computers will break this but Bitcoin has an answer for quantum computers too.
Now I have to tell you what I described above is RSA encryption where Bitcoin uses elliptic curve digital signatures, so there are big differences in the specifics.  But I imagine you can see the general theme that applies to both -- there are functions out there that cancel one another out but where knowing only the public function, you cannot calculate the private function.

This is probably because the articles are looking at gold in its current role as commodity and not in its traditional role as money.
It's easy to understand whether it is deflationary or not by asking yourself, "Will an ounce of gold buy more now than it would a long time ago."
In this article you can see where they say that, for gold to have maintained the same purchasing power as it had in 1800 (another way of saying for it to cost the same when adjusted for inflation) it would need to cost from $260 to $348 an ounce.  It costs more, meaning its purchasing power has increased relative to CPI and GDP.  And that means that, as money, gold is deflationary.  The supply of it is growing less rapidly than the demand, so it becomes more valuable, relative to the things people would tend to buy with it, over time.

Yes, a general transition to mBTC as the standard unit of Bitcoin would probably accomplish everything a split would.  I suppose I just figured a split would be easier to accomplish and more proof against willfully ignorant media types pointing to large numbers and hollering "bubble".  But if mBTC is the consensus preferred solution, that's cool too, just as long as something of the sort happens to make Bitcoin seem as affordable to the general public as it actually is.

This is the way I see it.  I have my portfolio diversified, and that allows me to carry low risk investments and high risk investments.  Bitcoin is a high risk investment (set aside the fact that I believe in the principles and wish to spend it directly as much as possible).  If Bitcoin drops, as it has done so far in 2014, and I sell at a loss, it can offset some or all of my capital gains in other investments, without limit.  If Bitcoin rises dramatically as it has done in the past (however unlikely that might be to happen again), then sure I will owe taxes on the gains, but that's a nice problem to have, gains to tax.
Right now, my losses in Bitcoin are not sufficient to offset my gains in other investments in 2014.  If the tax year ended today and I liquidated my portfolio across the board to realize all gains and losses, my Bitcoin losses would offset about 30% - 40% of my overall capital gains.  Sucks to lose money in an investment, but it's all about spreading out the risk and by doing so, to reduce that risk.

AAPL investing is not high risk for someone who bought when AAPL was under 500, what with their excellent balance sheet and cash flow.  Its better not to try to make psychological diagnoses based on a Redditt post or two.

What you suggest is possible.  However, the range of possible values of private keys is so vast that any such attack would be cost ineffective in the extreme.  I have read comparisons between guessing such a private key and identifying a specific molecule of water from the ocean, then randomly selecting a molecule of water from the ocean two different times and have it be your specific molecule both times . . . and if I recall, the odds of guessing the private key were still more remote.  That there are a few million wallets out there makes very little difference.  The overwhelming probability is that no wallet will ever be compromised by this approach.

I think a split would be accomplished, should one be agreed upon, much more simply than this, though I am seeing some stumbling blocks as I think this through more in-depth.  The community of miners already has protocol for determining mining difficulty periodically, for example, and for making awards of BTC to those miners or mining groups that meet criteria described in part by that difficulty.
A 1000 to 1 split of BTC, as an example, should only require the community of miners to make a one-time award of 999 BTC to every wallet for each BTC it currently contained, or for any fraction of BTC, 999 times that fraction be awarded as it might be to a miner.
The potential stumbling blocks I see are these:
1)  Such a split might take hours to days to accomplish in full.  During the process, the system would have to track exactly which coins had been split and which had not.  Otherwise, one BTC holder might enjoy the benefits of the split early in the process, make a new wallet, forward all the new BTC into it, and enjoy another split on the same coins when the process hits the new wallet.  On the other hand, an unfortunate BTC owner could forward un-split coins into a wallet that had already been processed for the split, thus leaving the person with the same number of coins (and 1/1000th the purchasing power) after the split as before.  Maybe the Bitcoin structure contains safeguards against these scenarios, but playing Devil's advocate against my own idea, it is worth consideration.
2)  A problem of scamming.  If the split were instantaneous, there would be a moment where BTC was worth, for example, $750 each on some exchange and $.75 each an instant later.  Now the exchanges would adjust to the split extremely rapidly, but there is a potential for some unfortunate investor to be duped into paying pre-split prices for post-split coins.
So I don't know.  If mBTC is the better approach as most posters here seem to think it is, then I can only hope that they are correct.  If the idea of a split were to gain traction, then if the two potential stumbling blocks I identified above, plus any others, could be addressed, the end result would be that end users need not do a thing in order to have their coins split -- it would happen across the entire BTC community in one large sweep.

Check the price of BRK.B.  It absolutely supports my "perception" non-bullshit.
To save you the bother, I know Buffett hates splits.  I also know he split BRK.B to provide greater access to the public to those shares.  This is not a perfect analogy, I acknowledge, because BTC can be bought in fractions on any exchange whereas shares of stock can only be bought in fractions via certain specialty brokers.
To go back to your BRK.A point, how many people do you think own fractional shares of BRK.A, though specialty brokers may well allow purchase of such fractional shares?  A very small percentage, wouldn't you agree?  BRK.A therefore belongs almost exclusively to an upper echelon who can afford whole shares.  This is not the goal we should be shooting for with BTC.

Then if I needed money, I would go to the bank, copy the code and use it to shift a quantity of it into a "daily use" wallet.  Then seal the code back up in another tamper evident envelope and lock it back up.

Of course it is speculative.  If vendors pull out of BTC and if governments move to crush it, then it will surely fall in price.  But if major retailers begin to accept it, and especially if they insist that their suppliers accept it further up the supply chain, then BTC absolutely will go up in value.
Overstock was good news, but they have a market cap under $1 billion.  Walmart averages more than that gross in sales per day.  If they get on board (no guarantee they will, but if they do) there is no way BTC will stay as inexpensive as it is.

I think a reasonable expectation for a real currency is that everyday purchases tend to be in amounts to within 1 or 2 places of the decimal point.  Maybe I am wrong here, and I want to say I have absolutely no problem handling purchases involving the 4th digit to the right of the decimal point.  But I think many people in the general public would agree that having most transactions priced close to the decimal point is easier for them to wrap their heads around.  That is the one thing my proposal to split BTC would accomplish.  Maybe you do not agree that this is worth the effort, but I think it is.

In the world of MMORPGs, there is a whole subset of humanoid called griefers.  I mean the person at a computer somewhere else in the world, not the character they play in the game.  These griefers will actually spend an extended period of time killing a low level character over and over again, just hanging out by the body to kill again as soon as he comes back to life.  You cannot reason with them that they are ruining the game for the other person; it is for precisely this reason that they do it.  Better in a video game than killing real people, I suppose.  And I am not exaggerating there.  I honestly believe some of these people have similar psychological problems to what sociopaths have, and it is a mercy that they are only brave enough to act on their evil intent via the relative safety of an internet connection.

Back up the wallet.  You should do this anyway, even if you were not planning to update the phone, just in case something went wrong and the file was corrupted on the phone.
The coins are not actually stored in the wallet.  They are tracked in the block chain, and your bitcoin software will recognize them as yours if you use the correct wallet (the wallet they are associated with in the block chain).
I cannot comment specifically on your bitcoin software.  I had it installed on my phone once, but I never used it to hold BTC.  I wound up installing and using Mycelium instead.  I'm sure, though, that it has an option to export or back-up your private key.  Use that function and restore from the same location after the phone update.

1)  The US government nurturing the growth of BTC by placing a multi-year moratorium on BTC capital gains taxes similar to what they did for sales taxes for internet sales for years.  This could result in a massive crush of wealthy folks using it as a tax haven (they could do so anyway, but I mean without breaking the law).
2)  A major bank like BofA allowing its customers to open accounts denominated in BTC.
3)  OPEC officially pricing their oil in BTC
Bust:  USA, Europe, or Japan banning virtual currencies.  Statistics released showing a rapid drop off of BTC sales at Overstock, Tiger Direct, etc., after the initial surge, indicating it was just a fad after all.  One of the very, very big BTC holders dumping on the market.  A method being discovered and publicly demonstrated by which the private key can be determined economically and in a reasonably short period of time.
I think many of the Boom scenarios are more likely than the Bust scenarios.

Harsh!  Is that fiat to BTC or BTC to fiat or 6% each way?  I am sure there is a portion of the fee to cover fraud going from fiat to BTC, but from BTC to fiat (where the machine collects BTC) seems very safe for the Robocoin folks to me.  We'll see, you may be right.  The market may bear 1% fees for purchase of BTC online and 6% fees at ATMs, but I am hoping for an eventual lowering of those fees.  The ATM 6% really is rough!
Of course, I'd also like to see more vendors accepting BTC so I only need do my conversions 1-way (fiat to BTC).  I live a little ways off the more well-traveled paths, and I don't know anywhere to spend BTC near where I am currently.

I never thought it was a ponzi scheme, but I will tell you why I never did.
A ponzi scheme requires a constant influx of new investment dollars, not only for the early folks in to make money, but for later folks in not to lose money.  This requirement is eternal; as soon as new investment capital stops coming in, someone (usually the overwhelming majority of investors to date) will lose money and the scheme will usually collapse.
BTC, in contrast, does not need a never ending influx of investor capital in order to work.  It needs investor capital (people buying in) right now to get up to speed, but this is not different from a start-up company.  It is totally different from a ponzi scheme.  The critical difference is when fiat coming into the system reaches equilibrium with fiat leaving the system.  If it were a ponzi scheme, the latest comers to the program would be stuck with a monetary loss to cover gains paid to earlier adopters.  This is not what will actually happen.  What will happen at that point is that speculating in BTC will cease to pay large returns, but BTC will retain its value and the latecomers to it will not lose their money.
So if a ponzi scheme makes early adopters wealthy at the expense of late adopters, and if BTC has made early adopters wealthy, too, it's a fair question to ask, where does that wealth come from?  You could say it comes from late adopters, and that would be true, but the late adopters are reimbursed in a sense by vendors willing to sell their goods for the same value as paid for the BTC.
I suppose the value of the entire capitalization of BTC is offset by an infinitesimally reduced value of the fiat currencies used to buy it.  In other words, if BTC's capitalization is $10 billion, there is around the world a resulting $10 billion less in demand for fiat.  The lower the demand, the lower the value.
But a totally different argument against the notion of BTC being a ponzi scheme is simply that the folks paid to spot and bust ponzi schemes all over the world are not sounding official alarms of the sort at all.  Maybe some shady government organizations in various places have done so, but when governments in places like the USA, Japan, Europe all fail to decry it as a ponzi scheme -- Germany even called it a currency of account or something like that -- that is a good sign it is not a ponzi scheme.  If there were anything illegal in it, it is so well-known now, you'd expect some government body or other to have started public service announcements warning people away from it long ago.

One thing central planners around the world never seem to be able to grasp is how resourceful human beings are in time of need.  Hell, we cannot even prevent folks caged up in prison from just breaking on out from time to time.  And the Chinese government thinks it can stop 1.2 billion people from finding a way to do this thing, a thing they surely see as beneficial to their finances in some way?  The genie is out of the bottle.

I totally agree.  I would love to see BTC begin to swallow up smaller currencies, grow bigger and stronger, eventually supplanting even the USD and EUR.
Now I will add one concern here.  Years ago, Argentina pegged its currency to the USD and saw its economy torn to shreds by this.  When poorly run nations do shift to BTC as their de facto currency, government mismanagement can no longer be inflated away, made vanish by devaluation of the currency in which the debt is denominated.
I just hope national leaders in those times will be more responsible with the public trust and the public's money so the people do not suffer for their mistakes or malfeasance.  For example, if the president of Pakistan (a randomly selected example) were to shift public money denominated in BTC to the wallets of cronies then seek asylum in Saudi Arabia, he or she could bankrupt the place in a single hour.  I do hope the people of the world will put safeguards in place to prevent their leaders doing this sort of thing.

I think the hacking into wallets thing works a bit differently than that.  I could be mistaken, but here goes.
As for hacking into your own wallet, you provide the service your whole encrypted wallet, which means they have your private key (encrypted).  The hacking you mention involves them finding your password to  decrypt that wallet.  It works because most passwords people use do not contain very much entropy at all.  For a simple instance, if your password is 15 characters long, you might believe there are 26^15 possible combinations (assuming not case sensitive) and you would be right.  However, if that 15 character password was actually 3 common English words strung together, then you'd be dealing with 5000^3 possible combinations, assuming the hacker tried a dictionary attack with the 5000 most common words and found yours among them.  125 billion possible combinations is a trivial brute-force break for any modern computer.
Deriving the private key from the public key, which is what would be needed here, is a different beast entirely.  There is no publicly known way to do it efficiently.  So then you are stuck with a brute force attack on a private key containing 2^256 possible combinations if I remember correctly.  This attack would be so difficult to carry out that if the wealth of the whole world were in that wallet, you would still use more money's worth of electricity in the attack than you would recover from a successful result eons into the effort.
TL;DR:  It was an expensive lesson.  Hopefully the authorities can get a static IP for the author of the Craigslist posting and find that clown for you, but if they cannot, I do not think you can ever recover anything.

Brain wallets can be completely safe if done right.  It's just that doing them right is very difficult.
On my phone, if I type an sms beginning with the word 'happy' it might automatically offer 'birthday' for the next word.  This is a simple example of how, in sentences, context plays a strong role in the distribution of probability, among all possible words, as to which the next word will be.  In other words, it destroys entropy.
So if you will make a brain wallet and want to use passages from a book, there are ways to increase entropy over selecting consecutive text.
One way might be to pick a starting point and only use words, counting from there, corresponding to a value in the Fibonnaci sequence.  Or take the 3rd word from start point, then then 1st after that, then 4th, 1st, 5th, and so on corresponding to the digits of pi.  This helps eliminate clues from context.
But even in this case, I think 90% of English communication is done using the 2000 commonest words.  A brain wallet cracker could limit itself to just those words and, with some intelligent weighting of probabilities, generate a partial rainbow table with high probability of breaking many book-based brain wallets.
Now if you make some nonstandard permutations in some words, you can really help yourself against an attacker.  Also, if you are determined to use a brain wallet, consider avoiding the ones that just single-pass sha256 your passphrase.  Brainwallet.org is one of these.  The ones that scrypt it a few hundred thosand times yield a final key that is much harder to brute force.

They could be doing it, especially on some wallet that cannot easily be linked to them, even if they are solvent.  Just a case of MK trading what remains of Gox's reputation for a lot of quick bucks.  He can "invest" with confidence knowing without question that Gox will let him withdraw his BTC whenever he likes.  If so, then he has incentive to run this sham as long as he can.  I still think he's just mismanaged Gox to insolvency though.
Either way I am surprised he hasn't already gone into hiding.  I don't advocate violence against him by any means, but it seems virtually certain he has cost some dangerous folks a lot of money.

I think this is an excellent idea for proof of work.  Another one that would be very interesting would be an alt coin variant of fold-it.  Fold-it is a game where the participant tries to move and turn strange shapes with unusual characteristics in such a way that they fit together as compactly as possible.  The real-world application of this is that what you are actually doing is building organic molecules in a process that could lead to better medicines.
The really interesting thing about using fold-it as proof of work for an alt coin is that it is so difficult and requires so much spatial awareness, a human being playing the game on a laptop may easily outperform a dedicated circuit working the same problem.  Imagine an alt coin based on this, making better medicines and leveling the playing field even more than Scrypt does.

I could use after tax proceeds to buy BTC Stateside also.  It's the gains on those BTC that are taxable anywhere in the world (for US citizens).

You mean where a person could be provided any value Y and they could efficiently calculate a value X such that the hash of X equals Y?  One key characteristic of hash functions is that they are one-way functions, so the scenario described would render SHA-256 useless.
Whoever figured out how to do this could make money in one or more of the following ways:
1)  Keep your knowledge of how to reverse SHA-256 secret.  When a major website is breached and hashed passwords leaked, reverse the hash to find the actual passwords.  Use or sell said passwords on that site, and try them on other popular sites using the same user name.  As this is illegal, it is the worst way of benefiting from the knowledge.  It is also less lucrative than others listed below.
2)  Keep your knowledge secret.  Write a small program to generate valid hash values, then reverse the hash to mine BTC.  Be smart about it and nobody would ever catch on that 50% of all mining was one guy or gal mining on a single CPU.  This is not illegal, so no worries there, and it would be very lucrative.  But if the secret leaked out, Bitcoin would plummet at least until the network switched to SHA-512.
3)  Short Bitcoin with everything you have, then reveal you know the secret.  This collapses Bitcoin prices at least temporarily and you make money.  Again, not illegal as far as I know.  Such things could be illegal (I think) if Bitcoin were stock in a company, but with Bitcoin right now, it seems like anything goes.
4)  Announce your secret and look for work in cryptography.  This would not pay as well as some of the other items, but it can be combined with them.  If you break SHA-256, I guarantee you will become a household name within the crypt-analysis community and will have no problem finding work.
The big problem here is, of course, the difficulty accomplishing the premise of the question.  When I read up on things relating to cryptography, be it one-way hash functions, public key cryptography (including the efforts to break it by factoring large semi-prime numbers, etc.), secret key cryptography, and so on, I am astonished how intelligent the folks in that field are.  It's even more impressive to me than the study of quantum electrodynamics in some ways.  As sharp as those folks are, they cannot yet break SHA-256, maybe never will.  So yeah, it can always happen, but the odds are very steeply against it.

I suppose if exchanges listed mBTC rather than BTC by default, it would be a good step in the right direction, would make my arguments for a split less compelling.  I just think a split would be the most permanent solution.  I mean, if BTC ever gets to $100,000 each, pricing a can of soda at .01 mBTC or at 10 microBTC (I don't know how to make that Greek letter for micro) gets a bit awkward.
There is precedent for this sort of thing, going the other direction, in the world of fiat currencies.  I realize that is no argument in itself, but just saying.  The Turkish Lira (TL) was so near worthless, they needed a ton of zeros after the most significant digit just to make the thing worth holding onto.  Then they came out with YTL, which was I think 1 million TL each.  My proposal for BTC is like this, except going in the other direction.

I guess any virtual currency is pre-mined depending how close you want to cut it.  I mean if a single coin is mined before the public knows about it, that is pre-mined too, right?  But you can appreciate, I hope, how with almost half of all potential BTC still not mined (and those that are mined spread over a large number of miners), this is a far cry from coins where a couple people mine half or more of the entire supply before trying to get others to buy in.
Besides that, Bitcoin was the first.  I'd imagine this would yield some special cases that no longer apply for the coins that came later.

Dogecoin was understood to be limited to 100 billion coins, but the software did not include any such limit.  The developers decided to kill the joke / play another joke, depending on how you look at it, by surprising everyone with a, "we'll just let the supply be unlimited" move.  All it took for them to do this was to decide not to implement the understood 100 billion limit in the software.  They could always put it in later, but the damage is done now, I think.
As for Bitcoin, the original conception was that it would be limited to 21 million coins, and that this would not be changed even by majority decision.  In fact, it is said that, if the 21 million coin limit were somehow changed (by unanimous decision I suppose) that it should no longer be called Bitcoin as it would no longer adhere to one of Bitcoin's core principles.  It is true that a majority could decide to make more Bitcoins, but I think the 21 million limit is almost like the Constitution in countries that have one.  Even if the majority could ignore the Constitution if they wanted to, it is generally understood that they shouldn't or they have gone away from the thing that was originally intended.

Man it is disturbing how many comments here indicate the commenter's failure to understand what seems to me a simple question.
It is understood that the theoretical person has tax liability.  The question was how he would satisfy these obligations if he had no USD, the only currency in which the IRS accepts payments.
From the taxpayer's perspective, it's hard to answer.  I suppose he would have no good choice other than to buy USD (or buy a check denominated in USD) and send to them.
From the IRS's POV it is simpler.  If they have to come and get them money, they will garnish wages and / or sieze property.  They will convert non-USD into USD by auction, and they don't care if it auctions cheaply versus actual value because the debt is only reduced by the number of USD thus produced; any loss from the sale would harm the taxpayer, not the IRS.

I have bought probably a few thousand dollars worth of products through Amazon over the years.  As I live and have worked overseas for a decade and a half now, Amazon has kept me supplied with good books, paper and Kindle, and has made it possible for me to provide Christmas and birthday gifts to loved ones from afar.
I want to ask you to add Bitcoin as a payment option to Amazon.com.  I really believe in it as a means of making payments to trusted suppliers like Amazon, as well as in its capacity to be the first widely adopted decentralized currency.  I think as a means of making payments, Bitcoin would be beneficial to Amazon as well as to the consumer.  It is instantly convertible to cash, and the merchant fees involved are, I believe, lower than the fees charged by credit card processors.
Therefore, please add Bitcoin to your available payment options.  If you do this, I will probably make all of my future purchases from Amazon via this option.

I agree about the bubbles and crashes 100%.  A stock's value can be fairly calculated using price to earnings, price to book, price to earnings growth, etc., though individual analysts may disagree on the weight to give each criteria.  Bubbles tend to form there when forward price to earnings projections exceed what reality can bear, then momentum investors jump in on the rise and make it rise some more . . . and the thing feeds on itself until some setback triggers the crash.
Bitcoin has no price to earnings, price to book, etc., because it is an entirely different kind of beast from stocks.  I don't believe any currency, virtual or otherwise, has ever had a bubble, and I don't believe Bitcoin will be the first to do so.  If Bitcoin were in a bubble, China's attempt to destroy it would have worked.  A loss of 50% its value when what I've read to be 2/3 of the exchange market was shut down is indicative of resilience to me, not of weakness.  So I am not worried about an actual bubble; I only fear these shrill voices from big names convincing John Q Public that Bitcoin is a bubble.  I'll continue to hope they fail to do so.
I think, if there is a single sign the haters have lost the fight completely, it will be when Bank of America discloses it has been accumulating Bitcoin in preparation to set itself up as an exchange or when Amazon announces it will accept Bitcoin for all purchases.  I hope 2014 contains such good news.

As for the replacement of a representative democracy with a true democracy, that would require one or more Constitutional amendments and would be, I think, unwise; it would concentrate too much authority over the country in a few major metropolitan areas.  This was exactly why, so I understand, founding fathers from smaller states insisted on a Senate where each state gets equal representation rather than representation in proportion to population as it is in the House.
The technical side of things seems completely sound to me.  I suppose there would be some issues to work out still, however.  For example, how to prevent theft of wallets.  How to overcome the Democratic Party's resistance to this idea as it makes voter fraud too difficult.  Things like that.

That could turn out to be a very good decision in the years to come.  100K invested with, say, a 50X return means $5 million when all is said and done.  But it is a very big "if".
I hate if in a year or two this advice costs you millions, but I would risk only enough that losing it all will maybe sting a bit but will not cause financial catastrophe for you.  There is still a real if diminishing chance BTC will fall to $0.00.
EDIT:  I am speaking above in terms of speculation on BTC.  Once the price settles down enough, I would absolutely suggest moving it all to BTC, especially if interest rates remain so low.

You're telling me time value (the value of the time remaining) on an option always decreases as the time remaining decreases?  Woah, someone alert the media!  Also, water is wet and the sun rises in the east.
Leaps have extremely low time value decay.  In fact, a common low risk / low reward investment strategy is to buy oom leaps and sell short term calls against it.  Low risk / low reward is like playing as the house in Vegas if we must insist on comparing all investment to gambling.  It is about the only type of investments I've made in the past 9 or 10 months.
Options provide leverage but the options are not, themselves, leveraged.  In other words, not bought on margin in case anyone thought they were.
I made a lot of money last year at this and a lot again this year.  My investments are typically well enough diversified that it would take nuclear holocaust to wipe me out financially.  I am only in AAPL options and BTC now, plus a couple investment properties I own outright, but most of my liquidity is plain old USD.

All right, I will go with this under the assumption that you are serious.
Minecraft is a game that involves, among other things, mining for minerals that will be used to build bigger, better things.  The game has very low resolution graphics and runs in Java on the CPU of the player's computer and over the network on the Minecraft server as well.
Bitcoin mining is not a game.  It involves finding the set of values X for a specific mathematical function such that f(X) = Y produces values of Y that fall within a range specified by the Bitcoin community.  Those who find X that fall within this set are awarded Bitcoins by consensus among the Bitcoin community, and those Bitcoins (BTC) have value in USD and other fiat currencies.  Bitcoin is mined using CPU (rarely nowadays and not profitable), using GPU (also unlikely to be profitable), and ASICs custom built for the purpose.  Mining BTC is not done by GUI and is not particularly interesting, though the rewards from doing so certainly are.
So you see, there is very little in common between Minecraft and BTC mining.  The closest they come to resembling one another in any way is that they contain the letter group "mine" in their names and they both happen on a computer.  Other than that, not much in common.

I agree with most of the other posts so far.  The danger at all points in an emerging technology is that it can appear to be on the brink of failure or already fully fledged and not worth investing in any more.  Sometimes it can appear to be both at the same time.
In Bitcoin's case, you mention 1300 btc for a buck.  Folks looking at Bitcoin a while later might well have said, "Oh, it's $2 per btc now.  Too late to catch a ride on this train."  We all now know that whoever said that was mistaken.
People a year or two for now will probably long for the days 1 BTC was only $800.  You did miss the superfast growth of bitcoin, but so did almost everyone else.  You are still here in time -- for high-ish risk, high potential reward, I think Bitcoin still cannot be beat for good investments.

I realize the stock - BTC comparison is imperfect, but it was the comparison I figured would be easiest for most folks to understand.  A better one, but one that illustrates the same point, would be to compare the rise in BTC price to the rise in the price of gold.  When gold is valued on the market fairly versus fiats (or when fiats are collectively valued fairly on the market versus gold -- another way of saying essentially the same thing), the market doesn't just say, "well that's enough about gold" and dump it in large quantities.  Lots of people hold it at high valuations versus fiat (or said the other way, lots of people use gold to stay out of fiat even when fiat is priced cheaply in terms of gold).
Yet more accurate would be, as you say, considering BTC only as a currency.  The EUR/USD currency pair used to trade as low as about .9.  As of this post, Google lists it at 1.366.  When the EUR rose against USD, or when USD fell against EUR, whichever way a person wants to look at it, then the rate got pretty stable, nobody with half a brain cried out, "The party's over; let's all sell our EUR now!"  It will be the same with BTC.  The days of enormous returns on the BTC forex-type investment will pass eventually, but that will not signal the end of BTC itself.  On the contrary, that will signal the dawn of BTC's viability as a stable (low risk) store of wealth.

I suspect it is not directed at Bitcoin specifically, but at any means by which Russia's domestic terrorists might receive funding from sympathizers.  Hard to say what the impact will be, though.  It is possible they would even exempt BTC from those restrictions entirely as long as it could be credibly established who owned the sending and receiving wallets.  As an example, if the sender used a wallet hosted by BTC-e (not my recommendation, but just an example) to make a payment for an online order, the sending and receiving wallets are not anonymous.  Maybe such regulations would require that exchanges keep official identification information on account holders but I don't really expect it to be an overt attempt to hinder legitimate use of BTC in Russia.
Now if the recently released Mikhail Khodorkovsky were to start sending funds to political dissidents in Russia via BTC, I would expect Putin to follow China on it.  As long as BTC does not threaten him, however, it should be OK.

I agree to an extent.  People who are going to buy BTC no matter what will pay the fee.  But I think BTC is somewhat price elastic among the broader population.

Bitcoin is not a stock.  Stocks move on rumors, but . . . the way I see it, most of the hardcore BTC devotees are already paid in as far as they can go.  Google planning something for BTC will not give these people more investment funds.  What will drive prices up with regard to Google is when they create appeal for a wider user base to get into BTC.  That wider user base will buy a lot of coins if BTC is destined to succeed.  I think if Google, Amazon, Walmart all offer BTC, that is when this thing will either surge massively or fade away depending on whether the public is interested.

The difficulty does scale, you are correct.  I was just alluding to the fact that, absent ASICs in the scrypt mining game, the most crowded the Litecoin mining community ever gets might be millions of miners each using one or more GPUs to mine (and where each gets a fairly even shot at the rewards) whereas Bitcoin mining is probably 90% of all mining done by less than 10% of the mining population -- those with ASICs.

When too many people sell relative to buyers, the price falls.  This brings in more buyers and slows down the sellers.  So it's a self-righting sort of situation as long as people who are getting out have plenty of time to do so, as they did in this case.  If they had been given 48 hours to get out, I'll bet we could have scooped up coins around $300 during the exodus.
Anyway, although I doubt the price will go like a rocket 1 February, I do expect that without that selling pressure, however much remains at this point, the price will be able to start rising again.  Maybe slowly, but I do expect to see it rise.

As for "should" of course I am biased, seeing as I will also have capital gains to report whenever I sell.  But what I think the IRS should do is provide a 2 or 3 year moratorium on any taxes to be paid on sales of Bitcoin, then a gradual easing in of taxes to the normal rate for capital gains.  This would enhance growth of the technology.  They did the same for Internet commerce, except there it was sales taxes instead of income tax.
I also believe they should formally declare that Bitcoin wallets owned by an American citizen are absolutely not to be considered a foreign bank account and do not have to be reported on form  regardless of the dollar equivalent of the value in that wallet.

Agreed, that is a shame.  Interestingly, I checked the destination wallet on bitcoin.info, and it still has the 5.750 BTC in it.  Not that the "seller" need rush to move those funds as they are pretty safe from seizure anyway unless he can be identified and apprehended by law enforcement.  But it seems interesting to me anyway.  Maybe I will try and keep an eye and see when those funds go a ton of different directions.  Their last stop before that event should be the wallet the "seller" either exchanged or spent those funds out of.

1)  Nobody controls it in the sense that they can keep you from modifying it and using the modified version.  The beauty is that transactions thus formed will either conform to the Bitcoin specifications or they will be rejected by the peers on the network when you submit a transaction.  As long as at least half of all peers are honest, an individual modifying the code for his own use cannot hurt the Bitcoin infrastructure.
2)  The mining rate is a function of the difficulty, and this is automatically adjusted by consensus among the peers in the network once every 2 weeks based on the previous 2 weeks' mining rate.
3)  There exist encryption schemes where a message can be encrypted using one key but can be decrypted using another.  Importantly, there exists no known way that the encryption key can be recovered even if an attacker knows the decryption key (which is public knowledge), the encrypted message, and the decrypted message.  So this is too complicated to explain in the time I have, but transmission of coins involves the sender encrypting with his public key and sending the message which identifies the receiver and the coins sent.  The peers on the network know that the sender really sent those coins because they can use the sender's public key to decrypt the message, but the sender's private key is never shared with anyone.
4)  No, there is no database of wallets.  Every user is responsible for his or her own, or he or she has made an online wallet in which case the website owner manages his or her wallet (unsafe in my opinion).  The transactions records are only in the blockchain, and that is replicated all throughout the network of peers.  An event that could destroy all copies of it would have destroyed all humanity in the process, so nobody will be left to miss it.

Carter's answer to USSR attacking Afghanistan (suicide, it turns out, though nobody knew it at the time) was to boycott the Olympics.  We need some President that tells Putin to take a hike or come prepared to fight.  I guarantee you Putin does not want his troops lined up across the battlefield with American troops.

Yes, the block reward would be multiplied in the same ratio as the split itself.  This adjusted block reward and the more prevalent coins should automatically and rapidly result in a proportional drop in per-coin value, though you are likely right about a temp shutdown of BTC trading on every good exchange.  The coin cap would automatically increase in the same ratio as was used in the split itself.
I will agree with you that this "split" idea has issues that would need to be hashed through.  And as I have posted elsewhere today, maybe mBTC is the easier solution after all.  Whatever it takes to stop the general public perceiving BTC as overpriced, though, that is my big concern.

It would not accomplish much.  As the other posts indicate, it could brute-force attack SHA hashes.  If all of that computing power were directed at brute forcing a single SHA-256 hash of specific value, trying to create a collision for that one value, the probability approaches a certainty that a collision would still not have been found.
Of course, brute force location of collisions is exactly what the miners are doing, but they are able to get positive results because they are trying to find collisions with a very large set of allowed values rather than with a single specific hash value.
Anyway returning from my digression, the network of bitcoin miners is virtually useless for anything except mining bitcoin.

However, I still would like to see the 1% come down over time for repeat customers logging in to make purchases from the same IP repeatedly over months.  I don't know, maybe even just give a .1% discount for customers who use a decent password.  It's a very fluid situation, though, so nothing for it but wait and see what market forces eventually dictate.

I get it, I promise.  I am just coming at the subject from the perspective of the uninitiated.  We can say, "if they knew it can be subdivided all the way down to a single Satoshi, they will know they can always afford to buy in."  But the catch-22 is that they may not stop long enough to learn this critical piece of information if their first glance reveals a unit price in excess of $700.
Gold is a good example of the divisibility of such assets, I agree.  However, even gold would likely benefit in price (but not in general acceptance because it is already very widely accepted as a measure of wealth) if instead of price per ounce, it were commonly priced per gram.
I suppose an item I left out of the initial post was the notion of a bubble.  Easy for the Krugmans and Greenspans to howl "bubble" with upper 3 digit unit prices (as measured in USD).  Not so easy for them to sell the bubble theory if 1 BTC is approximately, but not exactly, equal in worth to a single dollar.

Agreeing with sqig, spent coins are still gains if they buy more when spent than they would have the moment they were bought.  Still, if BTC will be taxed at the standard income tax rate, then BTC-rich folks will still be better off either selling or spending BTC over a span of years rather than all at once, as this allows them to get more of those gains captured in the lower tax brackets.  And yes, it's the flow of BTC, not the mere existence or valuation of it, that will strengthen this currency over time.

If I understand your meaning, yes, they do change in value (not in quantity) with the markets.
So if you have 1 BTC in there, it will remain 1 BTC as long as you leave it.  But if you bought that BTC for $800 and the market dictates that 1 BTC is now worth $820, you can sell it (still 1 BTC) for $820 or thereabouts on any exchange that supports BTC/USD exchanges.

The government could cram it down everyone's throat easily enough.  It could simply tell the population, "trade your fiat for BTC before 1 Feb 2014 at market rates.  On 2 February we will print so much of that fiat, anything you did not exchange will serve its best function lining the cat litter box."
Or it could pull a Cyprus-caliber move and just dump a near-infinite supply of fiat into the system without prior warning.
Now I was in Bosnia immediately post war, and they were using the German Mark as the de facto currency, even in preference to their government-backed currency.  I was in Ukraine earlier than that, before the Karbovontsi were phased out and the Grivnya came in, and there the Karbovontsi (Kuponi) were all you could spend in stores (if I remember right) but USD were the way locals saved money because they held value like a beast compared to the local currency.
So this is just to say it was easy for any national government to kill its own currency.  It is less easy for them to dictate what the population will turn to from there.

Cook got in and immediately started taking on debt -- in a company that Jobs had for years kept flush with cash.  What kind of idiot does that?  It's equivalent to me walking into a convenience store with $500 in pocket and asking if I can buy a Coca Cola on store credit.  That's the idiot Tim Cook is.  He's ruining that company, and I'd say the dive in stock price from its all-time high shows that savvy investors know it.

I have a hard time seeing how BTC can stay this low if it is adopted widely.  Let's say Walmart starts accepting it.  As one article I saw linked in Redditt recently pointed out, Walmart has a habit of strong-arming its suppliers to keep costs down.  In this case, that could mean Walmart keeping BTC (not converting to USD immediately as Overstock is doing) and using it to pay its own suppliers.  If BTC only went to 5K per, we're looking at approximately $60 billion worth of BTC in existence, much of which is locked up in accounts that may or may not be accessible any more (not accessible if forgotten, lost, deleted, etc.).
Even if all that money could be dumped into the ecosystem, it just seems to me Walmart and their suppliers alone would need a very large portion (10% or more) of it to sustain an all-BTC supply chain.  This is not to mention all of the other companies that might be competing for the same BTC for their supply chains and any of them that wants to keep BTC on the balance sheet.  To have all of them do this is, I admit, optimistic, but it is absolutely not unrealistic.
I think BTC at $5K by year's end would be low.  More likely, I think, $20K.

The 21 million limit is fine.  It actually comes nowhere near the upper end of a BigInteger, which can and does handle 2048 bit numbers and larger for RSA encryption (not related to Bitcoin -- and still is not near its upper limit).  But I am mostly fine with a 21 million coin limit, so long as we can define fractions of a single bitcoin in such a way that ordinary Joes are comfortable referring to them using that term.  I think that's pretty much taken care of as well with mBTC and such, so Bitcoin is good to go.  It's Dodgycoin that's gone off the rails.

You didn't look at BRK.B did you?  Buffett split it to provide greater access to folks with more modest means.  As for BRK.A not being divisible,  unless it is not covered by the specialty brokers, it most certainly is possible to own a fraction of a share of BRK.A on that broker's books.  I'm sure they do this by aggregating small purchase requests into whole shares.  The point is that it can be done by those willing to work hard enough at it, but that this is not enough; the Bitcoin community must make every effort to lower even merely psychological / perception-based barriers to entry.

It would be an interesting, but very sad, twist if a war were fought over dominance of Bitcoin.  But there are two items in play here.  One is Bitcoin as a commodity.  In that sense, nations would do far better just buying BTC that is already mined.  More has been mined to date than will ever be mined in the future, so a nation that bought existing BTC quietly now would do better than it could (in terms of BTC as a commodity) with any amount of mining equipment.
But yes, if we consider Bitcoin as the whole infrastructure and not as the commodity, a nation might seek to dominate it.  Here, I think it would not be a matter of trying to get wealth from it, but rather a matter of trying to destroy it.  After all, a few double spends confirmed by consensus on the BTC network will see a massive loss of confidence and large shift either to fiat or to an altcoin.  Probably LTC if the latter scenario prevails.

Yes, they can upgrade the system at will.  A compromise of sha256 would allow mining to become too efficient.  A compromise of ECDSA would allow a person to spend from someone else's wallet.
In either case, if the community agrees to switch to new functions -- to sha512 and lattice based digital signatures for example -- they will do it rapidly.  In fact, I'd wager they'll upgrade faster than your bank, which uses related technology, will do.

I think you missed where I was not talking so much about splitting in order to improve, in any way, my own user experience; my opinion is that it would remove a possible objection (however ludicrous) the general public might have to adopting BTC as real currency.  As long as the mBTC becomes the standard unit of denomination, we are golden for now.  But as long as fools like Greenspan can point at BTC @ $750 and scream bubble, I fear the general public will agree for the absurd reason that $750 just seems so big to them.  There was the other consideration I pointed out of trying to keep everyday transactions denominated near the decimal point, again solved by using mBTC . . . but it is a matter of this becoming standard.  If BTC were split, it would automatically be standard.

I would love if they went the "buying BTC" route.  That would play out much like a hostile takeover in stocks.  Demand so great it constricts supply and drives prices up fast.  Granted, as soon as they had enough, they could bury BTC once and for all.  But those who sold last before it reached that magic number would do very well indeed.
To add some perspective here, though . . . if the IMF used their gold to buy BTC (they wouldn't, I know, but for purposes of understanding scale) they would just barely have enough to buy all the BTC issued to date, assuming the supply crush mentioned above didn't spike prices in the process.
Also to provide perspective, the USA spends $2 billion a day on quantitative easing.  So I am definitely not challenging your point, but rather am agreeing with it and suggesting there is a large number of players any of whom could destroy BTC easily right now.  No guarantee they will be strong enough to do so once it matures, however.
But I am encouraged by the fact that none of them has taken any steps to do so.  I am further encouraged by the almost certain knowledge that, if they did, another crypto would rise up behind BTC, and another and another and another until one finally made it.

Mine is a special case, but I will tell it in case it motivates anyone else.  I live outside the USA as I have for a decade and a half.  Worked for government sometimes and for US companies other times; I plan to return to USA someday.  Now my wages are not exempt from US taxes (setting aside the overseas earned income exemption which has an upper limit) and I paid my federal taxes every year.
But the state I lived in 15 years ago decided all of a sudden that I owed them a ton of taxes.  My tax preparation representative contacted them, shared the facts in my case with them, and based on the laws of that state, all agreed that I am not a legal resident of that state and am not subject to pay income tax there.
Then some bureaucrat in that state's tax collection agency went ahead and sent my bank a formal notice that it was to seize all my assets anyway.  When the error was detected, the agency sent the bank a notice rescinding the first directive, but it was too late; the bank had sent every damned penny I had with them to the state's taxman.
Now I am at the moment voluntarily between jobs, probably going to return to the States but living on savings in the mean time.  Bottom line: if not for family able to transfer money to me here overseas, I could literally have starved to death, with my wife and children, because of my former state's blunder.
Bitcoin protects me from this sort of administrative ham-handedness.  If they discover I legitimately owe money, I will liquidate my assets and pay the debt on my own, so this is not some way for me to escape real obligations.  But it protects me from some idiot seizing all my money because he or she had to get back to Minesweeper or Facebook and could not be bothered to check 5 seconds and learn it was all a mistake.
I am still waiting to get that money back though this happened months ago.  Once I knew the bank would not seize more money, I sold some stocks to replenish my accounts.  So I am OK while I wait.
Bitcoin would have helped me avoid the whole mess.  No easier for government drones to seize in error than it would be for them to seize a stack of greenbacks in my mattress.  Except Bitcoin is pretty resistant to theft by burglary, too, as long as you keep it password protected.
So that long sad story is my motivation.  Maybe it is too specific to apply to many folks as it is, but certain general characteristics in my story may be familiar to all too many honest folks screwed by the government in error.

That rate of growth is obviously not sustainable for a long period of time.  I believe it will continue to grow, but at a more modest pace in 2014 than it did in 2013.  It could still increase in value from 10x to 100x over the next couple of years assuming widespread adoption and acceptance.  But even if that does happen, growth will taper off and it will become an ordinary currency with relatively stable value.

Probably a mix of tendency to believe in conspiracy theories and the indications that there may be something to it in some cases.
Take Gox.  It's one thing for Reddittors to post wild theories about them being insolvent, even about them having lost or stolen the coin.  But forget Redditt for a moment.  Do you honestly believe BTC on Gox would be trading at a 60% discount, in some cases, to what it trades for outside Gox if many people at Gox didn't believe these same theories?
I mean, if you knew for certain that Gox was not going to steal anything and had not stolen or lost anything -- in short, that no cover-up was going on and that every coin would be intact after this hiccup was over -- then a person would be a fool to sell their $600 BTC for under $300, right?  But people on Gox were doing it.  This is very much a case of them not only believing in a conspiracy of sorts, or in one of many, but also of them selling at a major discount, they were so sure the conspiracy theory reflected the truth.
Gox's own failures in terms of tech, PR, and customer service certainly provide a rich environment in which these theories might take shape.  But worse, we know that some other BTC-related organizations have lost their customers' BTC all of a sudden, in some cases immediately closing up shop and essentially vanishing on them, in the past.  So the theories about Gox are neither completely without supporting evidence (however tenuous), nor without precedent.
Bottom line, I think a lot of people have a large portion of their net worth in Gox.  Maybe it was a small portion when they bought, but they became millionaires in 2013 and foolishly left their money online.  So they are scared.  I think this is the main thing behind these theories.  I don't think folks here are naturally inclined to them any more than the general population; it's just a function of current circumstances.
@_date: 2014-01-03 17:41:57
I think you make a good point.  Although it has been acknowledged that BTC is not all about investing, I do think that certain something that guided people to BTC early can help them sniff out winners in the stock market also.
I am very glad you do not fully accept the EMH, because I embrace Warren Buffett's legendary refutation of it.  Buy things that are worth more than the market realizes they are worth and hold them until the market notices its mistake.
If we view BTC from an investment perspective for a moment, we have banks and economists all over the place doing their best to convince "the market" (all potential users of BTC) that it is overvalued now.  This has kept price growth in check as have events in China.  This same market will soon enough realize, however, that many of the arguments against BTC have been unsound, and they will move in and make the price reach equilibrium with value somewhere far above the current price point.
All of this is to agree, the folks in BTC now see which way the wind is blowing earlier than the general population, and this may indeed be of benefit to them should they try their hands in stocks.
As for me, I have just over 1/4 of my investment money in BTC and LTC.  Most of it is still in options.  That was largely because I did not want to realize more capital gains than I already have in 2013.  Now I may re-balance my investments a bit.

As long as the general public can be persuaded to think of Bitcoin in terms of mBTC rather than in terms of BTC, I agree with you entirely.

Maybe.  I know China had mass adoption before their old men in suits said "no", but as it happens, their currency is very stable.  Those same old men in suits again.  Behind them are, I suppose, Japan, South Korea, Europe, USA, Canada, maybe a few others not necessarily in that order.  So it looks like the big criterion for widespread adoption right now is to be in a tech savvy country.  I guess that makes sense.  Some of the countries with very unstable currencies might lack any good way to make BTC widespread (lack of Internet access for example), so I actually think those countries will stick with the USD or EUR for a while, and it really will remain up to the more developed nations to lead the way here.
I was just getting at the idea that, if the USD begins to grow unstable or gets a horrible rate of inflation, people might begin to insist big expenses be denominated in BTC even if the actual payment has to be carried out in the legal currency.

Now if Gox ever straightens out their business so that USD come out as easily as they can go in, that would be a very good time to hit the arbitrage cycle hard and fast until prices level out between Gox and the rest.  Mean time, best thing to do is avoid them.

You have not lost them.  I would get an external USB drive case -- they cost about $20 at Fry's if I remember right.  Remove the hard drive from your computer.  Put it in the USB case and take it to any other computer you want.  With that other computer booted up, you can access all intact files on the drive, including your wallet.  Just copy it to the other computer or use the computer to copy it to a thumb drive you provide, whatever you want.
As an aside, "re-install Windows" is often tech support code words for "we are under obligation to 'assist' you but we don't plan to actually do so."  I would look for other options before re-installing Windows if you have a significant number of files besides just the wallet you don't want to lose.

But I do not for a moment believe the same of Bitcoin.  I suppose the most important distinction right now, even more important than that BTC capitalization dwarfs the rest, is that 3rd party vendors are rapidly moving into the BTC space.  If people I never met are willing to give me things of a certain value for BTC, then BTC has that value by definition.

If I owned 51% of the hashing power and therefore control of a major (by then) currency, I think I would profit the most by keeping as much hashing power as I could for mining but at the same time keeping little enough not to destroy confidence in the currency altogether.
On the other hand, if by that time there are derivatives written against BTC like call and put options are written against stocks, the most profitable thing you could do for yourself was to buy every put (or equivalent) you could get your hands on, then double spend all over the place to crash the currency and get those puts deep in the money.

They did not deny the vulnerability.  They said (correctly) that the vulnerability has been known and documented for years, and that a correctly configured exchange should not have any difficulties as a result of it.

As these BTC were mined in 2009, I'm guessing you did not have an encrypted wallet.  As such, please be extremely careful about this.  If the specialist finds the wallet and knows what it is, he can move those BTC to a wallet of his own creation.  You would be very hard-pressed to recover anything.
If you need professional assistance with this, I would recommend you require the specialist allow you to be present at all times while they work on the machine.

On BTC-e, LTC can be traded for USD or for BTC.  I agree that LTC is a little more volatile than BTC.  If memory serves, I have seen it trading at .026 BTC per LTC and all the way up to about .033 BTC per LTC.
But this extra volatility is the only advantage.  Buying more LTC because they are cheaper only allows you to roughly match the gains/losses the same USD worth of BTC would.  For example, if you buy 10 BTC or 350 LTC, you pay the same amount, but you are roughly as likely to see the price of the BTC move $35 as you are to see the price of the LTC move $1.  So it is pretty much a wash, except for the slightly greater volatility in LTC.
One thing to keep in mind with LTC, though, is that it is not traded on as many exchanges and that a lower total dollar value is being traded than in BTC.  So if you buy a large quantity of LTC, then if the market moves against you, it can be harder to sell out of the position without actually driving the selling price down (the last coins you sell will go cheaper than the first ones).  This is really only an issue when you get into the hundreds of LTC, though.

I think it is a good time still to invest.  Keep in mind this will almost certainly not grow, in the next 20 years, by as great a percentage as it grew in the past 3.  But that is not really too important; as long as Bitcoin pays a better return than something else you could have invested in, then it was a good investment.  For your income, I think $20K is actually on the low side.  I have about $55K invested with earnings similar to yours when I was working (on voluntary break between jobs right now, long story).
I guess you just need to balance your appetite for risk against the potential gains, then diversify accordingly.  But even if Bitcoin does not rise in price from here, you can still spend them, so you lose nothing unless the price falls.  I personally expect a 10x return in the coming year or so.

They may be built to be unstable, but maybe I did not explain my viewpoint as well as I meant to.
USD is extremely resistant to wild swings in value in large part because it is so widely held around the world.  Just a quick look at Wikipedia shows FOREX transactions to be approximately $5.3 trillion a day in April 2013, and USD was one of the 2 currencies in the trading pair 87% of the time.  So we are looking at well over $4 trillion in USD traded per day.  The amount is so vast, it is extremely hard for any single actor -- even all but the largest nations -- to manipulate.
BTC is designed to be immune to central bank manipulation, but it is very vulnerable to pump and dump manipulation.  The whole capitalization of BTC is about $10 billion, and only a tiny fraction of this amount is traded daily.  If BTC rises in value such that its entire capitalization is, say, $10 trillion (I hope!), and through purchases, fiat-to-BTC trades, etc., we see $1 trillion a day in BTC movement, and if this movement is diffused across over 1 billion owners/users of BTC, then I guarantee you the price of BTC relative to gold, for example, will be much more stable than it is currently.  In such case, I expect only a handful of nations in the world will have the financial muscle, by buying or dumping BTC, to manipulate prices.  And I expect that the manipulation will right itself rapidly at a net monetary loss to the manipulator.

Coinbase does internal coin transactions off the blockchain.  Your coins with Coinbase are not in an individual wallet designated for you, so far I know.  On the bright side, they are unlikely to go down, so your coins should be fine.

You probably know already that "strong passwords" as identified by some online services are not necessarily strong at all.  "Password1!Password1!Password1!" as an example contains 30 characters including mixed case, punctuation, and numerals.  Yet a decent hacker with your wallet.dat file secured with this password should be spending your money within the hour.
Better is to use something like KeePass to generate nasty-difficult passwords for you.
Best of all is to avoid even the pseudo-randomness of any computer and generate your passwords by truly random means.  One example would be to take a Bingo game, remove the numbers 65 through 75, and draw chits.  The "64" chit would be counted as "00" and the rest at face value.  Keep drawing chits as many times as you need to fill out the password considering that each draw of a chit provides 6 bits of entropy.
Even for wallets containing thousands of dollars, though, I think the KeePass way is secure enough.

If it's true that the 740K coins were stolen over years by unknown thieves rather than stolen by MK a couple weeks ago, then they are guilty not only of implementing a horrible piece of software and failing to monitor it properly, but also of gross negligence when it comes to bookkeeping.  If they had ever once balanced their bank to book, they would have seen that there was less BTC in the wallets than on the Gox internal ledger.  If this is truly just a case of massive theft for years, then I cannot imagine how someone so stupid could reach such a powerful position in the bitcoin community and in one of its major exchanges.  I would not trust MK to pump gas in my car.  He'd either maliciously pump it into his own car instead, or he'd pump the gas through my car's open window because he is too stupid to know better.

I'd have thought a credit union account would work fine with someone like Coinbase.  Does your account have an account number, and does your credit union have a SWIFT code?  If so, my suggestion is to try Coinbase.com.  They will take a couple days to get configured right, linked to your credit union account and all, but they are probably one of the safest BTC sellers you could get an account with.  I was confused getting started, too, and I lost time (wasted time, really) fussing with Mt. Gox before I went to Coinbase.  Hopefully my advice will be of use to you.

That is true.  I thought you were concerned about the Satoshi being the hard limit of divisibility.  It is only until the community says it isn't.
As for the upper limits of divisibility, I don't know if you are into programming at all, but libraries exist in several programming languages for an object often referred to as BigInt.  I have used such libraries in Java, C++, and C  These libraries allow the programmer to create and perform the basic mathematical operations on integers that are arbitrarily large.  The limit is pretty much dictated by the computer's memory.  It would not be hard, with such big integers as a given, to create big floating point numbers of also virtually unlimited precision.  This would only need a BigInt object and then another numerical object to describe the position of the decimal point.
But let's be practical here.  Gold is only divisible -- even theoretically -- into individual atoms.  If for sake of discussion we equated 1 BTC to an ounce of gold, then the digits beginning about 25 places to the right of the decimal point would be smaller than atoms of gold.  So the adjustment needed for BTC to exceed the upper theoretical limit of the divisibility of gold is not that large, really.

No, BTC will almost certainly move far from where it is over time.  When China drops BTC again next month and the banking sectors' lapdogs in media report it again as if it were the first time, or when they report on Silkroad again, etc., this can set BTC back a little temporarily.
Japan, Europe, or USA banning it would be catastrophic, but this seems very unlikely to happen now.  On the other hand, major retailers like Amazon, Walmart, Target, and others at that sales capacity would dramatically drive demand up for a finite supply of coins.  In that case, I cannot imagine the BTC to USD rate remaining as low as it is regardless of any arrangements anyone may have made to date.  Of course, I do not believe anyone would be trying to peg BTC to any particular piece of fiat right now anyway.  I don't think they could, and I don't see what they'd gain even if they could.

The anecdote was pretty plainly intended to show that not all short term drops result in permanent losses.  It was not intended to show that all short term drops result in substantial long-term gains.

Probably a mix of tendency to believe in conspiracy theories and the indications that there may be something to it in some cases.
Take Gox.  It's one thing for Reddittors to post wild theories about them being insolvent, even about them having lost or stolen the coin.  But forget Redditt for a moment.  Do you honestly believe BTC on Gox would be trading at a 60% discount, in some cases, to what it trades for outside Gox if many people at Gox didn't believe these same theories?
I mean, if you knew for certain that Gox was not going to steal anything and had not stolen or lost anything -- in short, that no cover-up was going on and that every coin would be intact after this hiccup was over -- then a person would be a fool to sell their $600 BTC for under $300, right?  But people on Gox were doing it.  This is very much a case of them not only believing in a conspiracy of sorts, or in one of many, but also of them selling at a major discount, they were so sure the conspiracy theory reflected the truth.
Gox's own failures in terms of tech, PR, and customer service certainly provide a rich environment in which these theories might take shape.  But worse, we know that some other BTC-related organizations have lost their customers' BTC all of a sudden, in some cases immediately closing up shop and essentially vanishing on them, in the past.  So the theories about Gox are neither completely without supporting evidence (however tenuous), nor without precedent.
Bottom line, I think a lot of people have a large portion of their net worth in Gox.  Maybe it was a small portion when they bought, but they became millionaires in 2013 and foolishly left their money online.  So they are scared.  I think this is the main thing behind these theories.  I don't think folks here are naturally inclined to them any more than the general population; it's just a function of current circumstances.

Ignore the idiot advertising his casino.  I am newish in BTC, but I made a pile of cash in Tesla Motors (ticker symbol TSLA) call options in 2013.  And I lost a pile when things went wrong.  Net very positive, though.  So I can tell you the feeling . . . when you look at your account and see you made 17% gains in a single day, then see the same again the next day, and so on, man a guy could get used to that!  When it turns south, though, I swear the sun actually seems to dim in the sky, you find yourself sweating for no reason, a bit of insomnia sets in.  It's just something a guy needs to try and keep in perspective.  I got a lot better at it over the months, and I am sure I will do well if BTC takes off or if it collapses.  I expect it to take off, though.  Main thing is to learn to get less excited about the up days and less sad about the down days.  This is one reason I now never sell in sell offs (like the fake news about a hack on bitpay yesterday) or buy in up markets -- I just bought what I want to hold and will hold it until I am ready to spend it.

As usual, your reply conjures to mind images of a red-faced, middle aged man with gin blossoms and a raging drunk on slurring spittle laced profanity at the screen on a break from psychologically abusing his wife and kids.
Gold is deflationary and was used as an effective basis of wealth for a whole lot longer than any inflationary currency you could name for me.  Land, also deflationary if a person considered it to be a surrogate for money.
As for your claim, "not one single country in the world has a deflationary currency any more . . .," that is, as far as I am aware, true.  But when one considers the devastating effects of inflation in some of those countries, I am astonished you hold that up as validation of your case.
If you are not so married to the notion of redistribution that "all equal in poverty" looks like Utopia to you, then it is hard to imagine how you can believe such currencies help your argument.
Anyway, I almost regret wasting the time typing this reply.

The OP tipped one person a dollar early in the replies.  If all the remaining tips were the discussed 1/25 of a cent in bitcoins, and if every single post was by a unique account and got tipped, those other tips would sum up to less than the dollar of that one tip.
So the OP had the money to make good.  Plus, I give the OP credit that he or she could spot junk accounts and ignore them unless the scammer put in even more effort to carry out such an inefficient scheme.

I worried about the same thing back in late 2013 when I came on board and the blockchain was a lot smaller than it is now.  But I think you hit on some important pieces of the solution.  Light wallets for computers that cannot handle the whole blockchain, Moore's law for many others.
More controversial I'm sure, and I am not 100% sure this is even possible, but it occurred to me that the community could implement a fork to sever old blocks.  In that scenario, say with a 95% consensus like SegWit requires, a new block is built -- or set of blocks are built -- that place exactly the same amount of bitcoins down to the last satoshi in every wallet as in the pre-fork blockchain, but which designates those new blocks the root blocks of the replacement chain.
It seems this could be done.  Let's say a plan is agreed, to be adopted on 95% consensus, that as of the first block after New Year each year, a new version of bitcoin core, etc., will be published that consolidates all previous blockchain transactions into a set of new root blocks.  This software also tracks the old, large blockchain as before.
Votes would be counted as they are with SegWit.  If and when 95% was reached, the old blockchain would no longer be live.  The newer, shorter blockchain would be canonical.  It would lose all the transaction history of the old blockchain and original proof of work (but that would still be available for archive purposes) but would contain all the same bitcoins in all the same wallets, compacted into a much smaller space.
This will sound like pure heresy to some folks, but it could solve the problem indefinitely.

If you own them, then selling them is not shorting.  That's just selling to close the position.  Shorting is borrowing them and selling those with a promise to buy them back and return the borrowed coins later.
So as an example, say a person wanted to short 1 bitcoin now.  I own a bitcoin, so I maybe tell him to put up $300 to secure the loan, and I then loan him that bitcoin.  He sells it for $1000, the current market price, so $1300 is sitting on one side of the ledger and -1 btc on the other.  If the btc loses value to $900, he can cash out by buying the bitcoin back at $900 and returning it to me to close the position, then taking his $400 (a $100 profit) and walking away.
But if btc rises a couple hundred, say over $1250, it triggers a warning.  I tell him he needs to deposit more funds to secure the loan (of 1 btc) or face a margin call.  By contract, I typically have the right to close the position at my discretion without notice, etc.  But in practice I will ask him to deposit more money to secure the loan or face that margin call.  Now if he cannot or will not deposit more money, I buy 1 btc at $1250 to reimburse myself the loaned btc, and I return $50 to him.  As he opened the position with a deposit of $300 and left with $50, we see that the rising price of btc caused him to lose money.
Reality is a bit more complex than this because of bid / ask spreads and commissions and because the broker is not usually the owner of the loaned btc directly, but rather acts as middle man.  But this is the essence of shorting.
I never shorted btc.  Did short stocks on rare occasion.  Dangerous, but I made some money doing it.

Passing out the public address of their wallet really has few significant downsides.  I can think of 2:
1)  Because those wallets are part of the public record in the block chain, everyone knows how much money is in each.  Then if they know who owns a given wallet, they know how much money he has.
2)  A person might not want people to know where they spend their money and on what.  Again, tying a wallet to that person ties the transactions to that person.
But theft is not a problem.  Any wallet has a public address and a private address.  Think of them as one-way doors.  BTC can pass through the public address into a wallet but cannot pass out through that address.  The private address is the reverse, that BTC can pass out through it and not in.
If you know the private address of a wallet, it is not hard to calculate the public address.  The reverse is not true, however.  Given the public address, there is no known way more efficient than brute force (guessing more times than there are atoms in the known universe) to determine its corresponding private address.
So you can put a public bitcoin address on a billboard, in a magazine ad, or on TV without risk of losing those funds.

Bitcoin is not just a get-rich-quick scheme or a libertarian dream.  I'll tell you what.  I had a certain state seize all my money in the bank one year because they thought I was not paying my taxes properly.  It was their error, of course, and they returned everything in a few months without paying me a dime of interest on it.
If you've ever been robbed (I have) then you will have some notion of how it feels.  They took all my money and didn't care if I had food in the cupboard or not.  It was worse than a kick in the face.
If you have bitcoin and take proper precautions, nobody can take it from you.  No state can arbitrarily seize it, no bank can put a hold on it.  When you consider what is really yours in this world, it turns out to be precious little.  Even real estate -- with property taxes, "owning" real estate really amounts to owning the exclusive right to rent that property from the government.  But bitcoin is something of value you can really own.
If you don't get it, don't worry.  Fiat will never completely go away.  But don't hold your breath waiting for bitcoin to go away either.  It's never going to happen.

It's a good theory.  In stocks, they call what you described a long squeeze.  Its opposite, the short squeeze, is more common, where short positions are forced to buy to close which forces the price higher, which in turn forces more shorts into a margin call, and the cycle repeats.  I was long calls on TSLA when they had their incredible summer in 2013.  So nice.  It's not as nice being on the other end of it like here.

Claims of pump and dump were hard to refute then.  Or a Ponzi scheme.  But a pump &amp; dump never recovers like this.  They are always a one-shot deal.  This recovery is broader-based by a wide margin than the first run-up, more measured.  There is no Mt. Gox that handles such a huge fraction of all trades.
I don't think this is euphoria at all.  I think the world is really figuring out what bitcoin is worth.  When India is pulling some sketchy shit like seizing gold (I don't know if they are, but I have heard it's so) then I'm sure most Americans cannot even imagine the comfort of an Indian being able to say, "I have something of value they cannot take.

Sorry, no, you're mistaken.
That this guy shorted futures contracts on bitcoin rather than shorting bitcoin itself doesn't change the fact of whether it's selling to cover or selling short.  If he had owned (was long on) bitcoin futures and sold them, that would be selling to cover, not shorting.  In this case he shorted, which means he borrowed and sold them with a promise to buy them back at market price later.  Shorting makes you lose money when the price rises.  Selling to cover only makes you miss out on gains you'd otherwise have gotten.
This guy shorted, selling something he didn't own with a promise to buy it back to close his position later.  None of what I'm saying is a matter of opinion.  It is basic fact in investing, easily confirmed with a simple google search.

I'd buy the bitcoin.  Euro will stay near parity with USD, give or take 50%.  Bitcoin, on the other hand, should increase greatly in value in the same time frame.  At worst I think it will settle in at some multiple of the USD, but greater adoption will drive the price higher -- growing demand against a near-steady supply.
If and when nations sick of seeing wealth destroyed by inflation go to bitcoin -- either officially or as a black market-type store of capital -- the price rise will accelerate.

Right.  But many bitcoin software packages will manage multiple wallets simultaneously, virtually invisible to the user.  If a person wanted to receive payments without linking their identity to a given wallet, they could simply create a new wallet through which to receive the new payment.
Additional steps might need to be taken to stop a person associating that new wallet with other wallets the person owns, depending on how private they wanted / needed to be.  But yeah, it's always possible to make a new wallet for every incoming payment and consolidate those bitcoins later, through a mixing service if desired.

My suspicion, based on next-to-nothing, is increasing loss of confidence in the yuan.
People want to preserve wealth in whatever denomination they can, and bitcoin is probably easier to come by there than USD.  Besides this, bitcoin is more easily transported and hidden than any cash or precious metal and is safe from counterfeiters.
Whatever the reasons, looking on fiatleak.com, it's clear how much China is driving demand right now.  They are the ones moving the price up so quickly.

It does roll off the tongue better than "bitcoin and the remoras" I guess.

I wonder if this stayed on the front page all of 2017, would the donation amount to an entire cent.

I get it.  I bought a fair portion of what I'm currently holding above the current price.  Sickening to see Karpeles apparent mismanagement / embezzlement at Mt. Gox bring the whole thing down.  But I held on.  I traded out a bunch of what I had for Litecoin and even Dogecoin, so I am still a long way from break-even.  But if I had panicked and sold, I would not have run over to buttcoin and rooted for everyone else to lose too.
Having said that, I can kind of see where you're coming from on it.  Losing money brings out the worst in a lot of us.  They might be decent people and we're just seeing their worst side.

Wider merchant acceptance.  But even now, if my employer offered wages in bitcoin or USD, I would take the bitcoin.

The thing I would love to see on a map is the flow of BTC from IP to IP.  I realize using IPs for visualizing BTC transactions is imperfect, but it is something that can be done now with publicly available information.
Bitcoin.info has the "relayed by IP" listed for each transaction.  On the visualization map, this would be the sender, and the receiver would be the last "relayed by IP" associated with the receiving wallet, if there is any such IP.  That is, if the receiving wallet ever made a spend transaction in the past.
Again, this is imperfect because of Tor and because wallets don't have a physical location anyway, but the beauty of such a visualization is to show BTC as a self-contained currency that doesn't need any link to fiat to have value.
