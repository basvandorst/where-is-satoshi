Bank of America is about to charge me 12 bucks a month just to keep my money in their bank. Money that they use to make money for themselves. I can avoid the fee by leaving a huge chunk of cash in the account, but fiat cash depreciates every second it sits there. I cannot wait until I don't need a bank account anymore.

Go buy some stawwwwks bro. I hear Coca-cola is a good one. Great dividend and a moat. Oh wait. Nobody really needs Coca-cola. And some states are going to tax the shit out of soda. I hear Warren-Buffet manipulates the price of the stock too. He says Cherry coke is his favorite, but he is just saying that so people HODL until he dumps! OH AND DONT FORGET ABOUT PEPSI - THE ONE TRUE COLA! Coca-cola stock will be worthless by next month! Sell NOWWWW!!!

No shit they don't have to. Don't be stupid. That isn't what I was saying. The government backing something might convince people that it has value, but that does not in and of itself make it have value or any specific value. The government of Zimbabwe backed its currency 100% even when they had to print billion dollar bills, but people did not actually value the currency very much.
People value Bitcoin as a decentralized means of exchange and store of value that is not tied to the traditional banking system. They value it as a deflationary asset. They value it because of the network and technology that makes its use possible.
This is my last post. Have the last word if you want.

What does backed by the government mean though? If the government started mandating what everything's value was in dollars, we would have communism. News like that would make Bitcoin's price soar. The government recognizes the dollar as legal tender, but the value is still (and should be) decided by the people using it. Every single currency that has gone through hyperinflation was government backed. Not being backed by a government is one of Bitcoin's strengths. That is one of the main reasons many of us are here.

Predictable cash flows are just that until they aren't. Of course Coca-cola is "safe" for now and my post was mostly hyperbole to make fun of beanietulipbubble because he obviously just made that account specifically for trolling and FUDing Bitcoin. You can FUD literally any asset. You could FUD a bottle of distilled water in the desert.

They are worth to me what I believe they are worth. The same way that dollars are worth what people believe they are worth.

Alright, don't take me seriously.
Go put more money into your 401k.

Zero borders for money. Money and people are different things. No borders for immigration would be hell on earth for the citizens of any country that is worth relocating to permanently. If you hate your own country and culture so much, just leave, man. Never understood people with this mindset. Just leave. It isnt that hard. But you won't. We all know why.
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:32:26
I mean the value of a dollar. How many goods you can buy with one dollar. Look up "value" in the dictionary.
 Your second paragraph is a massive straw man. Who says that such a change would have to happen so fast that people or governments could not adjust or if it would even have to happen at all for Bitcoin to increase in value to the level of something like gold, for example?
Anyway, you are clearly far too educated in monetary economics for me to possibly understand. I'm sure the government will leave your "tax exempt" retirement accounts just the way they are until you are ready to retire. They will never ever change the rules to kick the can further down the road. No possible way. Good luck.

That is how I buy my Bitcoin. It is really, really fast. I get the e-mail from my exchange confirming the transfer usually by the time I walk outside the konbini. I couldn't believe it the first time I did it.

Name another crypto that has been used to buy a building.
Yeah. That's what I thought.

I wouldn't go as far to say that it is apocalypse resistant.
Apocalypse resistant stores of value:

Oh, they don't do anything important, just make sure we don't have to walk through our own shit on the way to work every morning.

Prove this fact. Where is your evidence? I legit want to see the proof.

I'm gonna go out on a limb here, but I'd wager you have never protested or even noticed that very few garbage collectors or sewer inspectors are female.

Don't get mad, and just think about the type of person who does stuff like that. Be glad you aren't them for richer or for poorer. Money can buy a lot of things, but it cannot make people like you. There is no point responding to any of it because while some of them will shotgun shart posts about economics and finance that appear to have some merit, the truth is they don't know anything for certain and are only going by the recent price drop. If the trend suddenly reversed, they would probably delete their accounts. People love being right about stuff and this is their chance to claim they were right all along. Maybe they are right? Who cares? There is a certain subset of humanity that will literally try to shit on anyone's parade. They would walk up to someone who just found out his cancer was in remission, and out of the kindness of their hearts, remind him that there is a chance his cancer could come back and be even worse than before, as if he didn't know. They won't admit it, but they hated it when Bitcoin was doing well. Nobody without any skin in the game would be here shitposting otherwise. HODL or sell, but don't waste your time on those types.

You will have to find a different sort of buyer for your assets.

Don't forget "I was the first person to translate the whitepaper into Japanese."
He says this, but I cannot find a video of him anywhere using Japanese, and I cannot find a white paper translation with his name on it. Some Japanese people interviewed him for a Youtube show of some sort a while back, but it was all in English. The guy is a pathological liar.

Look at this chart. Last week it went down, but it was up the week before. I'm expecting the price to go up very soon. Get in now. This is huge.

Android is an operating system, not a phone. I guess you think a 300 dollar lenovo is the same as a 3000 dollar gaming pc because they both run windows.

I was about to comment the same thing. The people that spam about it going down are either no-coiners here to gloat because they felt bad because they had no BTC when it ATHed or they sold their position and now want to be justified in that decision. The most annoying ones are the ones that actually pretend to be concerned about other people's money.
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:33:19
I'm surprised they let him in in the first place.

Sounds like a good plan.

I was a self-made millionaire before I got into Bitcoin. I was the first investor in Bitcoin startup companies and I translated the white paper into Japanese. And the white paper says that the lightning network sucks. Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin.
