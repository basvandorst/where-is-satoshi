I know that.  But you said NO business in the world.   
I just mentioned a few that can handle the volume.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:18:15
Are you sure? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:44:22
Just like any other prediction.  We won't know until tomorrow.  :-)
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:11:51
Is it 2019 already?
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:58:48
Doge is faster.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:15:00
VISA does just fine.  Oh, and MasterCard.  And American Express.  And a few others.  DUh.

It’s like reading a never ending fortune cookie.    
@_date: 2018-05-11 08:09:53
You should buy mad Dogecoins.   
@_date: 2018-05-11 03:38:19
Looks like lots of coins are on sale today.   
@_date: 2018-05-11 08:09:12
Okay.   I went and ate a dick.

Oops.   Didn’t mean to mis classify the asshat Indian as a bot, sir.   
Eat a fat dick.

You’re entitled to you’re opinion, but this article is trash.

“Last twenty-four hours have shown that market doesn’t hurry to run upward once again. Bulls, who bought bitcoin for almost $10k, are nervously looking at current situation, continuing to urge in their rightness. They predict bitcoin cost far away from $10k in the nearest future. This crowd doesn’t even suspect that the bears are watching the whole situation with pleasure and are waiting.”
Did a bot write this?

You’re the one not understanding.    
If there’s 1000 blocks to go and the price drops to a dollar a hell of a lot of mining power is going to switch off.    
Just who is going to mine those last 1000 blocks?   It’s going to take forever and transaction speed would slow to near zero.   
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:22:17
Yeah after 2016 blocks.   Blocks won’t be getting solved very quickly at 1$ per coin.   
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:21:11
If it drops to 1$ the difficulty adjustment could take a while.

I sold My brain for %100$ BTC.   I just can’t even believe I got soooooooo much.

It is well known that Mr.  Trump is a moron.    
Do you disagree?
@_date: 2019-09-20 19:31:16
They did allow people to keep up to 5 Troy ounces in gold coin form.    Exceptions were also made for artists, dentists, collectors, Etcetera.   
Man, I wish I had 5 ounces of those coins today....
@_date: 2018-02-16 07:05:10
I thinks it’s like and prayers making it go up.
