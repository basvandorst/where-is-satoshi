What's the point of having 21 million coins? Bitcoin can survive even if all but one of the coins are lost. A coin can be divided into 100 million pieces, but can be further divided if necessary. Why not just start with one "coin" divided down into trillionths (or smaller) and transfer those around?
Currently, coins are used as incentives for mining, but eventually those will run out and the only rewards will be transaction fees. Couldn't we have simply jumped right to the end game?

As long as this happens (comparing BTC to another currency), Bitcoin hasn't truly achieved independence. It's like learning a second language: for a long time you "think" in your native language, then translate into the new one. When you finally start thinking in the new language, that's when you can say you're proficient.
Once you become proficient in BTC, you'll stop worrying that you've lost money because its value as compared to another currency has dropped. You'll be "in the BTC ecosystem" and the only thing that matters is whether you believe you're getting a fair price.

Back in the California Gold Rush days (1850s), the ones making the money weren't the gold miners. Most prospectors lived impoverished lives, mining on speculation that one day they'd strike gold. Instead, the wealthy ones were the people *selling supplies and services* to the miners.
Expect the real winners here to be Butterfly Labs and others like them.
