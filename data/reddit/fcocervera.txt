How do I check for this on electrum? Is it just the checkbox that says 'dynamic fees?'

I emailed CS about the same issue and they suggested I send my cell phone bill. 
Side question: Does anyone use Simple.com + Gemini? Heard some banks are closing accounts that are tied to bitcoin activity. Want to know if Simple is bitcoin friendly...

I can imagine there is going to be some interesting challenges when implementing Bitcoin payments. Mainly, with a credit card, AirBnb can hold a users information on file and charge the card after the guests stay. But with Bitcoin, they can't pull the charge, so they would have to make a change that allows for a prepayment. 
Does anyone know if they currently authorized the card up front or make the full charged up front?

I don't understand the use case for using pot coin over bitcoin. Is the thought that they'll be more attracted to it because it has the word 'pot' in it? Is there something technically different with pot coin that btc doesn't offer?
