If they reach 51%, does that mean they, hypothetically, can change the fundamentals of the protocol? Like increase the total amount of bitcoin available up from 21 million or change the hashing difficulty at will? Legit question, I don't know much about the technical details.
Edit: I like how people are downvoting me for asking an honest question.

I think what he means, is that this style of interview with constant cuts and leaving out the continuity of including the interviewers questions is very easy to manipulate in the editing room. Not saying that you did this, just saying it's often done.
@_date: 2014-01-12 20:43:38
That is true, but file sharing doesn't depend on retailers either. Imagine if the government made it illegal for any business to accept Bitcoin. Sure, the protocol would still be intact, but the technology wouldn't be able to go mainstream. It would be used only for illicit purposes, and change nothing in the current financial system. It would completely kill Bitcoin's potential, and it would go back to 2009-2010 days.

That was really difficult to listen to. The constant skips, repeats and breaks in his speech patterns caused serious disruption in how my brain relaxes when it takes in information, which made it really hard to focus on the concepts he was talking about. Really unpleasant listening experience.

Never say how many coins or what kind of value you have in your possession. This can make you a target to would-be thieves and hackers, and increases the risk that you will be compromised. Announcing to the world how much money you have is a glaring flaw in your security strategy.

If you have any interest in the future of bitcoin, not just as an investment, but as a technology, i highly highly suggest watching this presentation by Andreas:

If that piqued your interest, then watch this longer discussion also by Andreas:

If it's made illegal, only a very small crowd will use it and it will never gain mainstream traction. This will essentially kill bitcoin's potential. While the protocol will still exist, it won't be growing.

Assuming he is Satoshi, do you think he just has the keys with a million bitcoins worth half a billion USD just sitting in a USB stick in his home drawer?

I hope you know that's a troll account.
@_date: 2016-05-02 15:41:07
He said in [this interview]( he didn't want to reveal himself, but was forced to and that he does not care if people believe him or not. Makes sense that he didn't want to go to extreme lengths to prove himself to the public, as it would go against his own interests.
@_date: 2016-05-02 15:45:56
He said in [this interview]( that he was forced to reveal himself, and didn't actually want to do it. Would also makes sense then why he is so hesitant to go out of his way to prove it to the whole world.

Wow that last answer... can you be any more dodgy haha
@_date: 2016-05-03 14:39:35
I think if he really is Satoshi, and has the keys locked away in a trust, involving contracts and other legal gatekeeping, that could be the hoops he is referring to. I'll hold my judgement until more information is available, but I wouldn't necessarily jump the gun and call him a fraud just because he doesn't instantly sign with the genesis block.
@_date: 2016-05-02 15:14:28
Assuming he's the real Satoshi, he was outed by a hack in the first place, not "attentionwhoring".

This video made me realize, that in order for mass scale adoption of bitcoins, it is required that all parties involved ultimately trust the security of the system. Since it seems like nobody except PhDs in cryptography and mathematics can ever hope to understand the inner workings of the transactions, the currency can not take off on a large scale. 
The average user will need BLIND trust in the system, and that the algorithm it operates under is protected from being compromised. Since this short video explanation already presents possible vulnerabilities (double spend flaws, as well as big computing resources has an ability  of taking over the system), it leaves us with a  hole where future technological inventions can have an unknown, and catastropic impact on the entire security of the current technology.
We trust bitcoin because what we currently know is possible **right now**, is *unlikely* (mind you, not impossible) to compromise the network. But at the same time simply accept and have faith in that future technological developments won't upset this balance? Foolish in my opinion.
Once the system is compromised once (and it very well might be once very big players - ie governments - enters the market), the integrity of the system, which ultimately means the currency itself, will rest in peace.

No, it isn't too late. If Bitcoin gains mainstream acceptance (and everything so far is indicating that we are heading there rapidly) we haven't even seen a fraction of its potential yet. Price could easily increase 10 fold or more. But don't take my word for it, look around, do some research and make an informed decision before you decide to invest in anything.
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:03:33
