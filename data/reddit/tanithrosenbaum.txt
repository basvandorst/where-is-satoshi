Not quite. On top of that it's a miniature police station with a small chair, desk, heater, tea kettle and other stuff, from what I read. Couldn't find really good photos on the web, but this gives a glimpse:

A ... roach? Of all animals?  
I'm not quite certain if I'd appreciate that valentine's day gift if it had been given to me. A roach... *shudders*

I think that went over his head.

More like no tangible form. Information does require energy to be stored (cf. [Landauer's Principle]( and therefore has mass.

That's just plain wrong. Greek are free to move to any EU country to live and work there under EU law, just like any other EU citizen.

That's true with other heating too though. Look at how domestic heating systems are set up in Germany. You have one boiler in the basement, usually using either oil, natural gas, or wood chips as energy source. Then you have hot water pipes to every room in the house, and a radiator in every room you can turn up or down as needed. Works pretty well, even more so with modern motorized/networked radiator valves that can be remote controlled and automated as needed with a home automation system.
Heating like that both circumvents the problem of efficiency in terms of energy conversion, and efficiency in terms of minimalism, i.e. only heating the rooms you actually need heated. 
With energy conversion efficiency I mean that if you heat with electricity, you have to convert your energy at minimum twice, once from your primary source to electricity, and then back from electricity to heat. Electric heating only makes sense if your electricity comes from either renewables or nuclear, heating with electricity from coal or gas is wasting CO2 emissions that can be used elsewhere more productively.

If non-americans are more [dense]( they should score worse, not better... ;-)

There are no EU citizens that are illegal immigrants inside the EU. See the links I posted for explanation. If you are referring to refugees from outside the EU, that's an entirely different story, but one that isn't relevant here as this discussion is about greek citizens.

"nuclear research base"
Worded like that it sounds like he was building nukes for the military...

yea but the living expenses are a very tiny fraction of those in NYC, so it evens out.

Ahh I see. So essentially the equivalent of a faked SEC filing. Thank you for the explanation, makes sense now.

I looked into it, it takes up to two weeks here in Europe via bank transfer. Decided to use  instead, contacted a local seller with high reputation, left my phone number, got called back, met up, had my BTC within 12 hours (and it only took that long because I left them that message at 2 AM)
@_date: 2017-06-08 18:04:27
How do they do that though? I mean, the only way to keep the price low is to sell, or what am I missing here?

Because Bitcoin is experiencing a hype right now. Loads of both inexperienced and very greedy people have read they can "print money" with bitcoin if they mine. And so they will throw money at everything that promises them superior mining power. 
Of course the smarter of these inexperienced and greedy people read reviews. But apparently there's still enough who don't and get blinded by BFL's shiny website. Favorable reviews like [this]( don't help either, as they gloss over the fact that the hardware simply isn't available to the average joe within a reasonable timeframe - if at all, before BFL finally goes belly-up.
And yes, it IS a ponzy scheme. It has all the characteristics of one. The main one being "Give us loads of your money now, and we promise to make you filty rich. Any day now." and "Look, there's a small number of people who did get rich with us! That means everyone will!"
