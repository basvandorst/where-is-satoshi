Near the peak I sold enough of my initial investment to cover that off, plus a nice dinner out. The rest I'm going to ride out.

I'm not being a dick, its just the reality of the situation. You are absolutely entitled to be pissed off at yourself and can take some solace in the fact that you are not the only one. 
On the flipside, my post serves as a reminder to others that this is a volatile product and no one can predict where it is going to go. It isn't a matter of skill, its a matter of luck. Don't get involved unless you realize you are straight-up gambling. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:08:00
Yes, the primary Canadian exchange (CAVirtex - which has weathered this storm admirably) hit a low of $125 and is currently sitting at 214.98, and appears to be climbing. 
I've got bitcoins but I'm also prepared to watch my initial investment burn, so I'm not stressing out. All I'll say is this whole thing is remarkable to watch. 
Edit: Now $223 after a mere 90 seconds

As an FYI I did not proceed as I could not see a reasonable way to transfer the funds (I am not in the US). 
The bit of due diligence I did showed that this gentleman and his company appear to be legit. At least, your money is probably not going to some Nigerian prince. It is, however, a bit of a leap of faith any time you are sending money off into the ether. 
Edit: To be clear I don't make any recommendations on whether you should take this "bet" or not - do your homework and assess the risks.

If you think unfettered corporatism won't result in obvious, violent coercion - or worse, subtle coercion on a grand scale - you're insane. 
The populace at least has a shred of control over government though the electoral process. That's more than can be said for private enterprise. 
There is a reason government uses private entities when they absolutely need some heads bashed.

My only regret is that I have been waiting for my funds to clear since yesterday. I had full intentions of dumping in at around $75 (though with hindsight it went even lower). But nope.... "PROCESSING". 
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:06:21
I don't disagree with you in the least. The point is, though, its hard to have any kind of principled discussion when no one has any kind of useful model for this. I imagine the coming days and weeks will be instructive as the media hype dies down and there are fewer first-time entrants into the market.  
Whether stability or volatility is the flavour of this market is something only time can answer. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:47:56
Send me 1 BTC first to verify that you are indeed a real person with honest intentions. I will return that BTC to you so you can show me how your system works.

This is a gambling addiction first and foremost, but it is interesting with the overlay of the "free money" he got from bitcoin. 
"Playing with house money" is one of the oldest gambling fallacies out there and can actually increase your losses over time. After all, if you've already burned through 500k, 10,000 is chump change. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:42:34
Interesting. Is it just my imagination or are there comparison engines that can look at form/syntax/word choice/etc. to come up with the degree of similarity between two or more different texts? 
There might be an opportunity there to do some further digging. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:59:54
Cavirtex is showing buys hovering around $200. 
I assume you are looking at Canadianbitcoins.com? I think they have a set rate for buys/sells - they absorb the risk in exchange which leads to dramatic spreads (they buy back at $58 because if it drops to less than that before they can sell, they lose money). 
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:14:01
**No one knows.** 
I don't mean to be trite but this is an emergent phenomenon. Worse, it is largely fed by non-expert "investors". The price against the USD has followed some existing known patterns but that is not a good predictor - at least tulips are finite. 
To answer you question - either it will remain volatile or it will stabilize (or the third option fail either spectacularly or whimperingly). That is a non-answer but it simply doesn't get any better than that right now. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:54:08
I would love to have been feasting all day, but with most of my funds stuck in various verification/processing/pending cycles, its been impossible. 
That said, a purchase at $70 will either look genius in a few months, or foolhardy. Something about counting eggs or whatever. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:49:52
You will note my comment "If you believe in this project"
I make no suggestions or representations that this will recover. It is not a good investment vehicle. BUT if you convince yourself that it remains worth something, it is a simple way to mitigate your losses. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:30:40
Seems you found a bug. That's troubling. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:15:03
Thanks guys - and I assume I cannot transfer BTC to fund my account until verification is complete? 
(Sorry for the noob questions, every exchange is different and for obvious reasons I've intentionally avoided MTGox)
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:34:58
What? I didn't make any representations re: volatility. 
This is just copied and pasted from the bitcoin wiki in response to a comment that bitcoins were finite. They are not. They are infinitely divisible as a matter of design. 
I have no idea whether it will increase or decrease volatility and I don't pretend to. Take it up with the bitcoin protocol author(s). 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:57:48

Its probably uncouth to talk about giving reddit gold, and certainly it is a trifling gift in the face of such overwhelming generosity, but the only way I know how to say thanks for brightening the day of some strangers.
This is a good reminder to all of us - hundredaires on up to billionaires - that random acts of kindness are what makes a community tick, not where BTC stacks against USD. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:26:48
What the hell? I mean, I am in favour of efficient governments, but how on earth would a government find a new source of revenue for that???
Roads are always going to be expensive to build and maintain. Either we allow on party to take that over and pay them by way of taxes to do so, or we allow private enterprise to do the same thing and the end user still pays. How is that not a tax by a different name?
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:35:25
Well lets even the odds a bit. 
I think bitcoin is going to be worth less than $100 next week. I will give you $100 for 1 bitcoin. You can buy it back from me for $120 in one week, or I can decline that option. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:45:24

What country are you in?
In Canada I bought coins through Libertybit using email money transfer. Then I transferred some of those coins directly to MTGox - it allows you to fund your account that way. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:05:11
No, this is pretty clearly a DDoS attack on damn near everything related to bitcoin COUPLED with a lot of interested/panicky folks. 
The motive is simple - sell your holdings for a bunch of cash &gt; flood the market with tiny sells &gt; lag the hell out of the network to ferment additional panic &gt; re-buy at a lower price. 
The BTC economy is inherently susceptible to this kind of thing. 
It happens like, weekly, but given the interest in BTC this week, the effect is compounded. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:24:20
Please get some financial advice from a couple trusted professionals first. 
Paying down debt is the single best investment you can make in your future. Bitcoin may have increased in value 1000% in the last couple months, but paying down a debt is the equivalent of making an investment with a return of 6% (or whatever your interest rate is in your debt). That is a fantastic, safe return. 
You will retire earlier and wealthier if you eliminate that debt, trust me. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:42:35
No one knows what it will be. $100 may be realistic. It could also be worth $20 tomorrow morning. 
In any event, IF I believe in this as a currency OR I think there will be steady long term gains, I'd rather be holding 11 units at $104/unit with bitcoin sitting at $100 than with 1 unit at $250. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:42:31
The only answer with any relevance. Most everyone there will be familiar with bitcoins AND also know how to speak to you in a way that makes sense. People in this subreddit can only provide one half of that.

This is an awful investment for a graduation gift. Don't disrespect your parents or their wonderful gift by getting into something crazy volatile like this. This is just like taking it to Vegas and putting everything on black. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:28:29
Well, it is possible for someone to be a billionaire if they happen to hold a little less than half of all the currently available bitcoins - which is not likely but not impossible. 
I do agree that random acts of kindness is, if nothing else, an interesting way to generate new and helpful discussion.

There is never a "good time" to "invest" in something experimental and volatile. 
Everyone in here will tell you to BUY because that benefits them. But the reality is that no one can tell you whether your investment will be worth pennies on the dollar this time tomorrow - or see a 1500% return. 
Make no mistake, this is NOT a good investment vehicle.

0800-0899 checked, nuthin'
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:36:39
Well, obviously. If it plummets to $1 each but you still see value in the project, then buy $500 worth at a dollar. Now your average price per unit is $1.49 which wipes out your "bad" $250 investment. People still need to realize that this is volatile and you can still lose a lot of money at $100 or $50 or $10 per BTC.

Exchanges are not linked to MTgox. 
Difference exchanges have different prices because they are a stand-alone system. They are $94.9 on Virtex because that is what people are selling them for on that exchange. They are 58.84 on MTgox for the same reason. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:26:25
Its not that its a scam, its just that its a really, really bad bet. 
If they take your bet and the BTC value hits $200, they break even on their bet. 
If they already thought the value was going to exceed $200, though, why wouldn't they just buy at market rates right now for $120?
If the value hits $200, they make $80. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:24:55
Thank you for your insight. 
I'm in this for the long haul but with so many new entrances to the bitcoin market over the last few days - many of whom, I would wager, have little experience - it will be interesting to see how people react to a much more dramatic swing.

**THANK YOU FOR POSTING, OP.**
I just wanted to comment that I lost coins as well. I had no idea the cause but I have used bitcointools in the past and it clicked when I read this. I only lost about 2.1 BTC so not nearly the same scale of loss, but still a punch to the gut. 
Nice to see the community rallying around you, and this is a good reminder to everyone - **we keep each other safe by communicating about our experiences**. Let's keep that up. 
*edit to clarify that I have no idea if bitcointools is the culprit but it is a common thread.
