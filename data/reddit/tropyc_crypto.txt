Shouldn't we compare an asset with another one? Bitcoin is an asset and Nasdaq, DOW, S&amp;P 500 are indexes (follow performance of multiple assets)

The author appears to be a CoinDesk contributor and omits the DCG' media wing from his investigation... I recall reading a lot of articles from CoinDesk bashing Monero, promoting ZCash in '16/17 and forgetting to mention the ZEC miner's tax. 
DCG owns CoinDesk and kickstarted ZCash. 
OK taking money without disclosing there's promotion is unethical and shady - but I find the author's behaviour even worse. CoinDesk is as bad as the others and this disguised promotion of CoinDesk by bashing it's competitor in this article is what disgusts me most.
