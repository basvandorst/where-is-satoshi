"Seasoned" and "Sourced" are two concepts banks will consider when looking at your down payment. I think if the money is in your account for two months prior to applying for a mortgage they don't care.

I like to think some of that seven trillion will be going to Bitcoin and 250,000 would put 19mil at 4.75  trillion so I generally think that is the big possibility if investors start treating it in the same way as Gooold

I think they are saying by moving a large amount of btc to the exchange they can take out a bigger loan (margin position) and use that money and other monies to market buy causing any long positions to be profitable as well as have first mover advtange of buying in cheap.

I always thought the best way was through altcoins:
Setup btc-e account
Deposit btc
Trade for litecoin (or other stable altcoin)
Trade back to btc
Send btc to coinbase
You will pay a fee but it's easy

This is the perfect example of someone not being greedy. Serious. little sacrifices and readiness to work and you don't have to lose. washing those coins would be fun except I imagine myself doing something crazy like creating individual accounts with unique emails and then carving in a tree in every state. And also sell some face to face but nothing big probably cause patience is key to survival.

False. Assault riflles is a political term. I don't own any "assault rifles", but your statement does seem accurate for many AUTOMATIC rifles. Many states will allow private sale of semi-automatic rifles regardless of magazin size.

He waits till the btc equal 10k$ and then:
alloocates them to all countries based on a factor like population
gives them out to organizations as an incentive for making the world better (environmental break throughs or technological breakthroughs)
uses them as a way of stimulating the economy like QE
all of this after considering that moving the coins would cause the exchange rate to tank - maybe build a decentralized voting system or program that would determine the allocations

Wow! Mind Blow
At 29minutes when Novogratz is talking about using blockchain for identities and how personal data can possibly be setup for universal income. Wow. That is an amazing concept. I wonder if this is what Microsoft's announcement about creating a digital identity could lead too.
When Bill Tai was talking about the 4th industrial revolution and the electricity tokening being similar to the petro dollar tokening of oil. I was like whattttt. i want to hear more about that. The question about it didnt get enough of a response. Okay its a commodity. How will this work out with the common earth metal batteries that everyone is trying to figure out and build?
When Bill Tai mentioned what may be happening with Japan possibly hedging against a yen defualt by making bitcoin a currency I am wondeirng hwat going to happen with those Mt. Gox coins (600k btc's?) that karepeles said "he doesn't even want"..... 
When Charles Noyes is talking about Augur and decentralized gambling I keep thinking where can i put my money lol. Maybe more Ethereum.
Great presentation. I want to see more.

Because if we can get to a really high dollar amount, I think, volatility will drop even more which would make it more ideal for regular use and valuation which would get more people using it faster.

I was having a similar error about a week ago. it seems that everytime I sign out of the app I have to log back in with the sms and email confirmation. I was trying to keep the pin activated instead of having to log into everytime. 
My quick workaround: I have a note 4 and you can hit a screen button, to the left of the home button, and it shows you all the open apps and gives u the opportunity to split screen multipl apps. So, at that screen they give you an option to close all apps. 
After I close all apps, the pin is still set up and it looks like I am not logged out of the account within the app.
Hopefully I helped :0) and hopefully you have a note 4....
