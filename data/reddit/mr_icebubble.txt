10K usd
@_date: 2016-04-17 21:09:36
When we get there I bet people will talk about &gt;50K and possibly &gt;100K, but that's a stretch. Will take least 2 years until we get to those levels :D

You're doing gods work here. Good job. You're really contributing. Thank's a lot.

What ever you say "bitcoin".

I distinctively remember a representative of blockstream, saying it was possible as long as both protocols supported payment channels. But maybe I heard or interpreted what I heard wrong.

Sorry but you're not going to find unbiased information anywhere. If I were you I would instead of replacing this source of information, instead increase the number of sources and read a whole lot of biased comments and articles. Then weight all the arguments against each other.

Anonymous smart people doing smart thing with math. Here take my money, I don't understand anything, so how could I loose.

Ok, seems like Electrum is my friend. With the Electrum wallet I can add a new wallet. On the online computer I import the public key, on the offline computer I add the private key. Then on the online computer I do the send and save the unsigned transaction, which I can then sign on the offline computer. I've not tested it yet, but I think it will work. Which me luck. I need it.

Did the question include a timeframe and did it say anything about how low it would before going up there? How many people participated in the poll?
@_date: 2016-06-30 17:37:37
Wow, this makes the whole process unbelievably simple. No messing around installing programs and stuff. But can it be trusted? At one time I used one of these online wallets and it had a bug in the GUI so it sent a fee of like more then 0.5 bitcoin! :-O Im sure it wasnt intentional, but if you clicked around in the GUI there was this corner case where the message messed up the fee. 
Can I be 100% sure this wont happen with coinbin?
Electrum I think have been used such a long time, its kind of proven.
@_date: 2016-06-21 20:38:24
:) hm... there has got to be a way to loose them... 
@_date: 2016-02-03 16:50:20
Amazing news.
@_date: 2015-11-09 15:29:27
Maybe you can buy it from internet? I'm not sure. :-/
@_date: 2015-10-10 09:32:19
I also own some peercoins, not as many as you by a long shot. Are you trading it only or also part of the community or something like that?

Did you see the movie (The Forcaster)? What I really like about Armstrong is that he has a traders perspective on the market, and no trade is sacrosanct. A whole range of people have been saying more or less the same thing that he saying (we're at the end of a debt super cycle and heading into a cycle of war, etc). However, contrary to many gurus, he is not jumping ahead. Where many like to argue that the dollar is doomed will go to zero tomorrow, Armstrong argues that while that might be, the dollar will first strengthen a whole lot "because of reasons". I also get the feeling that his longer term predictions are much more accurate then the shorter term. Other people doing work with cycles, such as Charles Nenner, seems to be affected by this too. I hope Armstring is full of sh*t and dead wrong, but I think he will be proven right. I mean, yes we have a tremendous amount of debt and yes we have ultra low interest rates, yet there seems to be a global slow down. Since this is so, why would things not go down the toilet? My only hope is that technology will save us. Then again the AI will get us in the end anyway no matter what. ;-)

I recall people posting this list some time ago. It was circulating a whole lot when it was at the ignore/laugh stage. I'd agree that we're entering the fight stage.

I'm much more impressed with people coming up with ways to make money on Bitcoin using Bitcoin, then with people cloning the technology and then removing the core features that makes it so great.

He doesn't say anything about the duration. Surely he would have to agree that money have to be able to store value for more then 1 nano second - or else you would never be able to sell it for something else? What about 1 minute? A week? 
Also a store of value in relation to shat? In terms of paying for food? In terms of stocks in a start-up or maybe stocks in Coca-Cola or government bonds?
Armstrong also argues that just about anything that people can think of can become money. However just because something can be used as money for some time, doesn't mean that it is good money. Cigarettes in a prison might be used as money, but it's not good money because it burns easily.
Instead of taking what he writes literally, I usually try to see where he is coming from. I do think he is right about money having everywhere and always a relative value, therefor money can never have a "pegged store of value" because it will never work. Also booms and busts are tied to more then interest rates, it goes deeper and is part of human nature and the cycle of life.
I've been reading his blog for a few years. At times he contradicts himself and his fundamental analysis is colored to some extent by observer bias  
Simple put, he is a human just like everyone else and and interesting character at that.

You can not possible believe that? For any purpose? That means that you would be impressed by me if I forked the Bitcoin source code, built it and the run it on my own computer, un-connected to the internet and me as the only node, and only for the purpose of wasting energy. You are easily impressed my friend.

(at least ) 2 weaknesses in the paper:
1) "we need external verification of identity"... might not be a problem to some, but then again legacy banking is also ok. but it's not Bitcoin by any stretch of imagination.
2) the abstract should include the finding/conclusion/what ever.

What made you change your mind?
"Just sold all my bitcoins"
