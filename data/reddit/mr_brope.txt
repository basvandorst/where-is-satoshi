I believe you buy from sellers on GDAX, not from them as a company.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:12:18
Agreed, gonna spike hard once trading is enabled.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:11:19
I think the negative comment increase isn't just trolls, but also those who have investments in bitcoin and are simply new or worried about transaction fees and stuff. I mean it's no secret the fees have gotten high and everything.  
  
Again, not saying there isn't trolls lurking, but there's also some worried people mixed in I'm sure with the recent increase in fees and drop in btc exchange value.

His left or right dick?

9PST, 12EST.

LOL, dude we passed the moon a while ago. Someone said next stop is Mars...or the asteroid belt, right?
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:06:58

That's true, but I think the issue is weighing the $1 cost of btc vs whatever other payment the customer is using...I'd assume paying with Visa would be cheaper for them?

Mine is caught up in the massive SELL wall. Once it goes I'm buying BTC before the big liftoff, lol.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:00:05
I don't understand why they are able to just pause trading at their will if they deem it "too volatile".
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:27:23
Multiple. Anyone who wants to sell at that price gets bunched in.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:38:07
Someone keeps putting up a Buy Order for 250 BTC then cancels, and does it again. Very strange, lol.
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:08:21
First time I've seen an analogy of the two involving a Nintendo DS and  a PlayStation Vita, lol. I agree though.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:33:35
What Visa are you using that they charge you to use it?
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:21:21
I get similar results with the Jaxx and official bitcoin Wallet.

I'm not subbed to just one area, I think this sub has lots of helpful info too. Just because I don't like some of the elitism of some of the core users, doesn't mean I hate the sub. I read here daily. I was honestly asking a question, if you don't want me to refer to it as bcore I won't. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:26:01
Yeah, but the difficulty since then has dropped from 100% to 26%..the average time now is 10-60m. 
@_date: 2017-08-03 13:20:38
Why is that a problem? Read away I have nothing to hide. Just because I don't like how some elitists act doesn't mean I dislike people who follow the core team, not at all. I was just looking for an answer to my question that's it, but there's only been like one person here to even attempt to answer it. My post was true, a $5 transfer has costed me over a $1.50 and that was just a week ago. Have fees gone down? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:44:26
I know the merchant pays the fee for having Visa/Mastercard/Discover etc...but I've never heard of a merchant passing that along, and can say for a fact the DMV in DE does not do this, very bizarre.
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:33:37
Oh wow that's awesome, yeah I just got that update yesterday. I'll have to give it a shot today. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:58:15
Very strange. Well move to DE and you won't have to worry about it ;D lol. But seriously though, I'd just bring cash, that's ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:08:46
Can we drive our Tesla on Mars?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:25:48
Nothing new here, move along.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:01:38
It's strange, because on Chrome it crashed for me, but I can load it up on Internet Explorer on my PC, and Chrome works fine with GDAX on my phone.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:20:48
They must be new to bitcoin, lol.  
We've seen bigger swings...
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:20:46
Nah they're using cryptocompare, it says it right on that page.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:28:44
Yes, be warned. Bitcoin took all my money and they keep making it bigger! Please help!
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:07:21
anyone have a stream up for it?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:57:01
Pretty sure EST.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:27:45
Who else can't sleep? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:53:26
Just was on my Coinbase account and the fees are still astronomical. These are the same fees we had last week when the mempools were overflowing...why are they still so high?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:21:20
I don't understand when other price posts are still rolling through?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:44:36
Me. Because I didn't have any extra money to buy the dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:16:12
...at this rate maybe 6 months.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:37:47
If you just put in 50 bucks a year ago you'd have over $300 now. Do it asap, we're seeing earnings nobody can even fathom.
I put in $2400 on September 22. Now worth over $5k. Fuckin ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:14:05
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:07:11
you're all correct, it's the 1.49% fee Coinbase charges. Thanks for all the quick answers!
