Fuck it, I'll put in the other half and buy the schools with them. We'll slash the prices, make text books mandatorily digital and sell them for pennies. Except for the children of the rich. We'll make sure to charge them relative to their wealth on a level that makes them realize why the poor couldn't afford to get educated because of the system they allowed to be built. So Jeff Bezos, relative to your 100 billion dollar wealth, your child tuition will be a trillion dollars for them to graduate. Don't have the money? Don't worry, well loan you the rest at insane interest rates that can't be defaulted on because of reasons.

I want to read this book now to see what our kids are being told about my bitcoin.

There are services for that. Like coinbase merchant services. You can set it up so it cashes you out instantly keeping you safe from market volatility, or cash out 90% and leave 10% so on and so forth. This has been around for a long time. Merchants need to be educated on this. Been thinking of starting a consulting business setting this up for them and explaining this because someone needs too if we want adoption to spread. Even Binance has this service. I only found out about it after Binance's CEO tweeted this explanation to Elon, telling him that if he adopted crypto payments he would buy a 2020 roadster.

Yup, I've given at least 10 bitcoins so far. Mostly to nephiews and nieces on their birthdays so they can afford to go to college. Unlike me who dropped out as soon as I realized they wanted me to be a debt slave to them for life by charging me 40k a semester.

Just noticed the website. u/omegaweapon are you able to build in a crypto per gameplay mechanism? To accept Bitcoin and other coins per gameplay use? I want to buy some for my bar and have them set up to be paid for with crypto in order to push adoption. like a penny in btc per gameplay type of deal

Sure, but I can only pay you in bitconnect if that's okay with you?

Yup, every non holder always says it's about to go down to 0 so they can make themselves feel better for not having hopped on/hopping on the train before it leaves for it's next stop. I know bcus I used to be one of those people; will never be one of those people again.

Just did my part! Retweet it to make sure it's higher on the thread! You should add the crypto responses to the main post too u/EthMonkey so they can get retweeted. Then they'll rise to the top of the twitter thread and get Elon's attention.

I just tell them I have bchsv and bitconnect, then they get sad and hand me some spare change so I can eat.

really, so no government has ever confiscated anyones gold? Including when they removed the gold standard, ergo removing the gold promised behind every bill everyone had in their procession, bills that were supposed to represent said gold? Learn your history bro.

You really think so? Even after it has been delisted from all exchanges? 
@_date: 2019-01-08 19:02:22
