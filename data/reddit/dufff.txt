Everyone said it was fine. Bought new. Now everyone says sorry wasn’t good time. Bitcoin sucks!!!
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:56:00

People are saying it will drop to 1,000 that’s good as dead if you invested when it was over 7,000 we can’t just hold for years and years. Bitcoin might be great for those that got in early. But it burned the rest of us. Stop trying to make it sound otherwise. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:22:46
Exactly 
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:03:36

@_date: 2017-11-11 17:58:00
I agree. This sucks. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:41:20
What if I put my bitcoin into lite coin right before the dip. If it crashes I’ll cash out via lite coin. If it goes up I put it back in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:21:54
Move to GDax
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:48:51
