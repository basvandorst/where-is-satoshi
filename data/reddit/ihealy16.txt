You can sort that out when they respond to the ticket. I heard about a guy getting a transaction lost years ago on coinbase and they honored the transaction of like 4K for whatever it was trading at back then in the double digits and it's now worth like 50 times that

Didn't bitfinex get taken out of the us market? Lol
Edit: or shall I say pulled out of the US market?

Not going to lie. I felt more stupid after reading this comment. 
Side note: not trying to be a dick but what kind of question is that? That's like saying I wonder if the bank will mail my amazon package back to my house. It doesn't make any logical sense...

That would be called mining for a specific crypto but that would require start up fees for gear essentially or else it would be counter productive. Or you could throw smaller amounts of money like 20 bucks here 20 bucks here when you can afford it. Don't invest more than you could lose obviously or invest in another coin with research that's much lower per coin that you believe in and see if you bet any gains. If you plan on using coinbase you're only limited to three options of crypto BTC, ETH and LTC. But it's user friendly for beginners and the most popular choice at the moment by long shot.

Yeah close that shit asap
Edit: don't ever short something that's this crazy and uncharted territory with this much mass media hype behind it.

Did you fat finger the 2 when typing? Go to your accounts tab and see what's pending. It'll take 7 day before you'll be able to sell anyway.

Idk that's strange I've been in on BTC since 6600 and ltc 50 but those transactions were never instant till took a few hours for BTC and about 30-1hr on ltc 
Edit: wait for the ticket response from coinbase and take your profits and run since we're still looking bullish with futures around the corner

Just saying, still better odds than a scratch off ��

This was great. How does this not have a ton of upvotes.
