A lot of good suggestions here - I think having a bank provide bitcoin trading and an online wallet would be great. Even if they charged more and had a much wider spread than exchanges, the ease of getting money in/out and the trust associated with a large bank would make bitcoin accessible and useful to way more people than it is presently. I think basically any engagement would be good for bitcoin, by giving it more mainstream approval. 
The key is pitching it in such a way that the bank will want to take action on it; after all, the default for a large bureaucracy is always to do nothing. Can we pitch bitcoin in such a way that it benefits their existing business model, and looks like a success according to the metrics they already use to evaluate opportunities? I think the answer is yes.
**Savings** 
Banks are always competing for depositors and trying to get new people to sign up, hence all of the "earn $250 if you deposit $1k and keep it here for 3 months" type gimmicks. I think they could attract a lot of new depositors by offering bitcoin banking services as described elsewhere in the thread. A few services I can think of are offering a bitcoin wallet, or a pure BTC-&gt;USD address that converts received BTC immediately to cash, or providing exchange-like services (with much higher spread). All these services would be available only to people that have a full regular bank account, meaning that it brings in new customers for the bank's main business and these people already need to be AML vetted so there hopefully isn't any extra regulatory headache. 
**Investments** 
Obviously a lot of people are interested in speculating in BTC, however the existing pipelines (e.g. Dwolla -&gt; Mt Gox) are a pain in the ass and involve dealing with untrusted parties. For example I know some friends who wanted to invest in bitcoin but didn't want to deal with the headache. So if a bank offered a simple, trusted one-stop-shop for bitcoin investments I think this could bring a lot of new clients and business to the bank.
**Loans** 
I don't think bitcoin loans are a good idea right now. BTC loans will make sense if/when we have entire production cycles denominated in bitcoin, but right now everything people really want to spend money on is priced in USD, and the BTC price volatility means people might get burned. 
I suspect that the population of bitcoin-users are younger, more tech-savvy, and more financially active than the population in general, i.e. great new clients for a bank to attract. Meanwhile, since all of their clients need to be vetted for anti-money-laundering compliance, it doesn't create an added regulatory headache. In addition to bringing new clients and business, it would also generate a lot of free publicity and positive buzz for the bank, and make whoever implemented it internally look really good.
