Is there a quick way to explain mining? Where do the bitcoins come from? I understand they are just matching some hash tags, but where does the currency generate from that they are mining?


It seems to me that anything "virtual" can be compromised, even if it is stored locally.

Unless the company that has your "wallet" has issues, ie. Mt Gox.

I seem to bemissing something it would seem. I am still pretty new to the subject.
It still doesnt seem very safe, especially after reading the MT Gox story.

What about the people converting the conventional money into bit coins? You still have to trust them and could be scammed at that point.
I jsut still see plenty of risk involved. I am sure most of the issues like that can be ironed out after more of an infrastructure is built.

Its not a pocket of resistance,  its being practical.
If you sit there are give a sales pitch to a bartender whos job it is to act like your buddy, then ask him if he would rather have the bitcoins, it puts the worker in a awkward situation to turn it down.
This has nothing to do with the legitimacy of bitcoins, and everything to do with etiquette.
A server uses tips for rent, gas, and food. All of these things are not practically purchased with bitcoins, not should a server have to go through the hassle of learning what they are and how they operate.

What a dick. As someone who has worked for tips, they would not want this. Of course they are not going to turn it down.
They want cash they can spend of gas, not going through the hassle of  redeeming bitcoins.

I did read it, and they will not refuse it if they gave it to them. 
A server, who is probably scrapping by, does not want to have to learn about a new currency, download an app, and be extremely limited on what they can spend it on.

They were put in an awkward situation by the OP when asked.
