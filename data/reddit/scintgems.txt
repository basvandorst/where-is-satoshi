it's a subtle psychological trick and i think having a 1:200 ratio serves well

if you're referring to BTC then you're sorely mistaken because the primary attribute of BTC is that it eliminates the use and dependence upon trust
@_date: 2013-10-09 13:07:01


what gives you **that** idea
@_date: 2013-10-14 14:14:19
does it keep track of its own copy of the shared ledger?  How does it get its data?
@_date: 2013-10-26 16:39:46
all those rules are nonsense when applied to BTC
@_date: 2013-10-28 15:19:34
this behavior is toxic and anyone involved in this profiteering should be blackballed from the community

I think the underlying message is that fiat currency is used by the central bankers to wage wars and control everything, whereas BC can't be hijacked and doesn't help the agenda of those who consider themselves your masters.
@_date: 2013-10-06 15:35:07
well yeah take out law and you have chaos that can't benefit from a currency.  clan warfare with sticks and bones
this is all irrelevant to how BC works, unless you see the math behind BC as "law"
@_date: 2013-10-15 03:56:34
makes sense, simple, reliable, trustworthy.  why reinvent the wheel for one prototype?
@_date: 2013-10-13 22:00:51
well yeah im not debating that, electricity cost etc.  i am just pointing out an inherit component of the BC protocol
the cost of several participants keeping "a ledger" in sync via the internet is NOTHING compared to the abhorrent cost of a debt based fiat currency and its inherit flaws.
@_date: 2013-11-05 19:12:48
so much this
people think encryption is too hard, taxing, scary unknown, somehow possibly illegal even.
and that's how the state wants them to think
@_date: 2013-11-06 01:41:19
exactly right that it isn't surprising
assumptions are the mother of all fuckups, especially in CS
@_date: 2013-10-19 20:45:20
wont it be nice when ฿ is the most commonly known measurement of value?
"I wouldn't pay a single hundred thousandth of a bitcoin for that!"

in a time of great crisis gold only serves the rich, because they own all of it.  there are so many disadvantages to gold.  the only practical use is for electronics and satellites, etc, not for food shelter fuel, the only things people will barter for, and the ones that think they can survive trading with gold, they are misguided

assumptions of privacy are the mother of all fuckups

the address needs to be given to the customer, not "scanned" or whatever.  The QR code just makes it easier for customers' devices to enter merchants' addresses
i doubt it but this article may be meant to deter use of BTC by making people think it's harder to use than it really is.  I'll blame incompetence (this is the barely awake dinosaur banking system) before I blame intelligent treachery.
@_date: 2013-11-05 19:03:29
can we get this stickied?
@_date: 2013-10-13 18:17:26
in a frictionless economy there shouldn't really be any fees for trading or moving money
@_date: 2013-10-26 16:43:03
it's not inconceivable to think that years from now when this is forgotten, someone will use those coins to try to subvert the BTC market, or for faking buyer accounts and ordering from black market sites,
@_date: 2013-10-10 13:25:28
the world "runs" on debt.  The monetary systems are all a giant pile of crap and need replacement.

this is not true
a house has inherit value (you can live in it)
gold is intrinsically useless
economy collapses and you need food and shelter, fucking make some jewlery....  NOPE

what if everyone were savants who could keep the ledger going in their heads as natural as breathing and mining difficulty already maxed.
would the government then prohibit people from buying / selling / setting up [contracts]( by word of mouth?
@_date: 2013-11-06 17:27:24


they can't stop people from collaborating and sharing a ledger

we already have a set idea for the value of 1฿, what he proposes ispull the rug out from under that so newbies are tricked, of course this would only work for a short period
@_date: 2013-10-17 16:37:54
isn't there a new TLD for websites that accept BC
@_date: 2013-10-26 17:30:13


this doesn't make sense, what is stopping them from pushing a single transaction of 144,000 btc and call it a day, of course a special order would have to be placed with an exchange capable of handling such a huge sale, as this is such a high profile transaction (value wise)
@_date: 2013-10-26 16:56:55
this is censorship, blackballing, etc.
an ***extremely*** effective tool for evil
@_date: 2013-10-26 17:35:45
fuck the IRS, if they had any notion of intelligence they'd have already gotten on the BTC train and released a policy statement.  you can't cheat on taxes for such a non incorporated, ignoramus, outdated, clown car system
I think at the higher levels digital currency is a taboo subject, much like immigration or spies Data harvesting, and nobody wants to step up with any serious valuable discussion much less action 
@_date: 2013-11-02 21:02:06


there are legitimate creditors?


good thing the color red minus the number four equals salty whenever the letter T marries the constant PI
actually makes more sense than that
not debating if it happens, just saying

we're talking about internode traffic, not rootkits and shit
@_date: 2013-10-13 18:32:12


the whole reason BC works is because it minimizes the amount of trust involved in every transaction.
requiring someone to trust 'entity x' before they can trust how much the IOU is worth, this is no better than the central banking debt backed currencies the world uses now.
@_date: 2013-10-26 17:08:04
by putting a physical label on the person, takes said person's right to decide whether to have that label physically on said person away
so yeah, who is the real dictator, certainly not you, but the consensus that you subscribe to, so don't pretend to be all smug and superior to anyone because your opinion is not entirely your own

you can't stop the signal
@_date: 2013-10-13 18:41:38
Like BC but with an advertising plug attached to every address?

there are horror stories of people being held in contempt and locked up (guilty until proven innocent) for not being able to prove where or how the money is spent, make sure you get receipts and other things that may help you in court
@_date: 2013-10-06 13:58:02
interesting.  thanks for the insight

no matter how "mixed" a stash becomes it's always possible to trace all the money.
@_date: 2013-11-06 01:37:16
exactly, 
if we plan on keeping the rug under our feet for the foreseeable future, then it's wise to include BTC in the picture
@_date: 2013-11-02 20:29:01
well people need to start learning.
The concept isn't hard, and with time people will know and the units of measurement will come to consensus, or with any luck we won't need them because people will have gotten over that mindfuck tumor of an idea that it's good to split a single floating point number into several "categories"
@_date: 2013-10-26 17:51:32
nope, just this one because it's so prudent to news lately that it's hyper spammed

sore excuse for bad programming practices, not to mention completely invalid

I think an exchange is merely an entity with a lot of money to use for trading, and a ɃTC exchange is simply that which deals in ɃTC

while it certainly isn't easy to properly secure, the "it's too hard and complicated" argument is **bad**

gas-lighting asshole, still funny
@_date: 2013-11-04 01:10:03


which is waaaaaay more of something than an idea (fiat debt backed currency)
this argument sounds a lot like when people were trying to say Edward Snowden isn't a whistleblower because he didn't jump through the right hoops... 
semantics man
@_date: 2013-11-02 20:16:21


every currency has this problem
@_date: 2013-10-26 16:51:32
on that regard the government probably already has a bitcoin spinoff drafted that includes more record keeping for taxes and accountability
the government should just abolish the fed and fire that up, it would be... orgasmic
@_date: 2013-10-26 17:10:35
a lot of stupid people tend to confuse consensus with personal opinion, and in extreme cases, confuse consensus with "fact given by god"...
nationalism can drive entire countries blind raging murdering spree like the Nazis did

@_date: 2013-11-01 21:36:30
 I think you might want to check out [contracts](  
with which you can use an arbiter and that arbiter has complete control
this is just one of the many cool things you can do with asymmetric cryptography (what bitcoin uses)
it seems that you're actually arguing **for** BTC
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:04:41
those two quotes are incompatible
@_date: 2013-11-06 21:58:38
i think the government was never/will never able to effectively do that, otherwise it would already be crushed
@_date: 2013-11-03 01:43:30
i feel that the BTC decimal point is quite normalized enough as it is
and yes having one dollar to one bitcoin (or something) would be convenient, but it doesn't have quite the subtle psychological effect that (1:200) it's having now, because people know the value of a dollar, and since BTC is highly deflationary in contrast to dollars, people are starting to notice.
