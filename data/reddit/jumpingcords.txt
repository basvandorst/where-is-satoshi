No, they have tried many times, but they can't, there are too many hodlers and dip-buyers. Whales are not all-powerfull.

Quantum computing is no threat to Bitcoin, that has been debunked many times. When they become available (in a few decades) open source bitcoin will have adjusted its protocol long in advance. Bitcoin is antifragile, the more is attacked, the stronger it gets. And when the age comes where quantum computers ARE a threat, both the bad guys and the good guys, and the average citizen, will have them. It'll be much like it is now. Most progress made in the hardware industry is pretty linear. Worrying about quantum computers right now is certainly a waste of energy, given that quantum computers are still in their infantile stages, and can only operate at absolute zero temperatures. (Hint: It's an extremely difficult job to find a way to bring absolute zero cooling methods to the consumer market.). While ECDSA is indeed not secure under quantum computing, quantum computers don't yet exist and probably won't for a while. The DWAVE system often written about in the press is, even if all their claims are true, not a quantum computer of a kind that could be used for cryptography.
Bitcoin's security, when used properly with a new address on each transaction, depends on more than just ECDSA: Cryptographic hashes are much stronger than ECDSA under QC. Bitcoin's security was designed to be upgraded in a forward compatible way and could be upgraded if this were considered an imminent threat.
See the implications of quantum computers on public key cryptography here

Quantum computing is no threat to Bitcoin, that has been debunked many times. When they become available (in a few decades) open source bitcoin will have adjusted its protocol long in advance. Bitcoin is antifragile, the more is attacked, the stronger it gets. And when the age comes where quantum computers ARE a threat, both the bad guys and the good guys, and the average citizen, will have them. It'll be much like it is now. Most progress made in the hardware industry is pretty linear. Worrying about quantum computers right now is certainly a waste of energy, given that quantum computers are still in their infantile stages, and can only operate at absolute zero temperatures. (Hint: It's an extremely difficult job to find a way to bring absolute zero cooling methods to the consumer market.). While ECDSA is indeed not secure under quantum computing, quantum computers don't yet exist and probably won't for a while. The DWAVE system often written about in the press is, even if all their claims are true, not a quantum computer of a kind that could be used for cryptography.
Bitcoin's security, when used properly with a new address on each transaction, depends on more than just ECDSA: Cryptographic hashes are much stronger than ECDSA under QC. Bitcoin's security was designed to be upgraded in a forward compatible way and could be upgraded if this were considered an imminent threat.
See the implications of quantum computers on public key cryptography here

Are you new here? Bitcoin was below $1000 in January last year. Many hundreds of percent gains right now and you point to a mere 75% down? We've had many of those.

Great write up. Yes, bitcoin will become scarcer at a much faster rate than the average user is predicting. For every new cause/reason for bitcoin being lost/hedl, that scarcity rate increases. I agree, in 10 years, bitcoin will be very difficult to get (in large amounts). Of course, you will always be able to get satoshis (or smaller denominations) as easily as you can get cash now, as adoption and avenues of exchange continue growing exponentially.

That's VERy likely, Roger is the opposite of what he was on Bitcoin's earlier years. Something made him change drastically into a villain. He went from 'Bitcoin Jesus' to 'Bitcoin Judas' very quick. In that light (him being a gov asset), it makes 100% sense everything he has been doing to try to sabotage Bitcoin (which made no sense otherwise).
If you were the Government, trying (and we know is a 100% chance of that) to stop this new threatening tech to your centralized power, you would target key/influential individuals at the center of the Bitcoin ecosystem or otherwise useful idiots:
* Roger Ver
 
* Mike Hearn
 
* Gavin Andresen
 
* Craig Wright
* Barry Silvert 
All of them have worked actively to sabotage/co-opt Bitcoin at various degrees and stages, and the simpler explanation for them doing that, against all odds and their own stated principles and goals (for some of them), is that an 'external and powerful force' made them work against Bitcoin. Luckily, Money-Badger don't care, and Satoshi disappeared into thin air after giving this wonderful decentralized open-source worldwide-distributed censorship-resistant immutable gift to humanity, so they can get free from central powers control, if they choose to do so.

Yes, Bitcoin is the perfect safe haven, we just need for people to realize it since 99% of them still doesn't know it. Next FOMO will be epic, get in while it is still cheap. And even if there's a delay, the next halving in 2020 would trigger the new "bubble"/bull market.

At one point they will let go of the beach-ball they are holding underwater. It will soar fast, they come down again, but at a natural level above water. Then, the halvening will naturally raise the price much more, assuming the same demand, if the demand/adoption increases (as I think it will), we will see those exponential numbers a lot of o people are predicting (above $100,000/BTC).

This can help also for newbies:
 Everybody parroting: "The bitcoin bubble is about to pop" since 2009, don't know that bitcoin is a decentralized system with mathematically fixed, deflationary and limited supply currency and its growth is exponential.
So is not farfetched to say that it will be at 100,000 by 2020, since it came from less than $1 to $10,000 in less than 10 years, and it hasn't even hit the bottom part of the exponential 'S-Curve' of adoption. Here are some graphs and resources to help you do your own research:
 Remember its [fixed, limited supply of 21 million coins ever,]( there are just ~4.5 million (~20%)  bitcoins left to be mined till 2140 and the production will keep decreasing ("halving") every [4 years till then](  So, remember [this]( and [don't wait for the Bitcoin "bubble" to burst]( or for the price to drop significantly again, because you could be waiting forever:
