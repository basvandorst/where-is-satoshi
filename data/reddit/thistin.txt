Fax machines don't encrypt anything. The data is transferred in plain text.
Email is actually more secure than fax even without pgp. That is because SMTP servers talk to each other over SSL now. It's the default with all the big email providers like google.

This is how you do releases. Lots and lots of betas so everyone gets plenty of time to test it.

rand function is not a cryptographically secure random number generator. You should read from /dev/urandom or /dev/random. Or use `openssl rand`

Is this a knock on credit cards? 
It's funny because bitcoin full node numbers are always going down and there are increasing pleas for people to run full nodes for altruistic reasons. So in a way bitcoin blockchain will soon be running on compassion too.

This is the way to do it. Forget paper wallets. Use electrum. 
Once you have it setup send all the bitcoins from blockchain.info to an address in your watch-only wallet.

Because they insist on making it in first world countries when the rest of the world is happy with Chinese manufacturing. They pass on that added cost to consumers. You can get much better value for money by not using a pi.

They should create a section on their site that is protected by SSL and where the client can upload documents. This is the sane way of doing this. This is how everyone does it. Forex companies, bitcoin exchanges, payment providers, everyone.

That would require carrier support.

Bitcoin's value is determined by the market mechanism. The rate at which new bitcoins are created is by and large fixed. But their value isn't and that in turn determines how much resources are allocated to mining which can result in bitcoins being mined at a faster rate than originally expected at least until the next difficulty adjustment.

Depends on where you are. The web is global and we have no way of knowing until you tell us.


Yes for a short time period. It uses thermal printing which tends to fade over time so not a good idea for long term storage.

Wow 7,500 for just the bip32 mpk stuff. That's exorbitant!

This is the solution that national currencies use all the time. The turkish lira for example has been revalued numerous times throughout its history.
I don't like bits, milibits and such. "New bitcoin" yes if need be. But not any of these sub-division units. The only exception being satoshis.

It's an actual wallet not just a piece of paper. You can spend from it without needing to create a new wallet, you get unlimited addresses not just one and so on and on.

It's already an echo chamber in here. Closing it down to non-bitcoiners will only make it worse.
With that said there is an example use case on the wiki about cutting down on forum spam by making people pay a tiny amount of bitcoin before they can post. The wiki itself requires you to pay to be able to edit it. Maybe that's where you got the idea?

It says $158 mill. How did you come to the 125 mill number?
$158 mill from transactions and then you have new coins mined and sold on top of that. Actually the number of new coins mined comes to $291 mill at current prices so you have miners being paid more than all the transactions in the network!

It means to waste addresses. It's not good for the environment. Addresses are scarce and if you keep wasting them we'll run out and then what'll you do?

Depends on whether you mean 2015 dollars or 2115 dollars.

ATMs make a lot of money and there is very little competition. That's why he doesn't care too much about customer service.

Sounds like you want us to do your homework for you! See the comparison of wallets on bitcoin.org and decide for yourself.

Armory *is* deterministic although armory doesn't use english word mnemonics for its backup. The root key, which is like the seed you find in other deterministic wallets, is represented as random letter strings grouped into columns. You can see an example here:
HD is a recent standard for deterministic wallets but deterministic wallets have been around for a lot longer. gmaxwell first suggested them years ago:

Yeah, you're right. Bitcoin is awesome! Tug a little harder. I'm almost ready to spill my load!

Prices are determined by demand and supply not what you believe. There have been many great technologies that have failed in the marketplace.

btc-e has been doing it for years. 
okcoin as well because they don't verify id before you can trade futures.

Your cold storage is no longer cold storage
You only need to backup an armory wallet once. It's a deterministic wallet so one backup is enough forever:
The best backup is a backup on paper of the root key. There is a tool to print such a backup built in to armory:
