Wall Street slowly but surely getting their feet wet with Bitcoin, way to go!

Why is everyone getting their hopes up so much? I am a huge Bitcoin supporter but I'm somewhat disappointed that the price has stayed flat this week after a series of good news:
- Auction coins bought at or above market price by a serious investor
- Newegg
-1-800 Flowers
- Banks getting involved
Whats up?
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:31:08
Yes, I got it from  indeed!

yeah, you can load it with Bitcoins or Litecoins &amp; you can purchase stuff with it in stores who have the Coinkite terminal. The terminal is set to ship in January 2014, so i hope to use the card in a store nearby soon!

Donated them 0.01 BTC

The Paper wallet will be stored inside a fire resistant safe.

Not true, you can connect Butterflylabs miners and get 50Gh/s per miner? It just depends which miner you connect to it, has nothing to do with it being hosted on a Pi

I would use Bitcoin just to show other people how easy and convenient the system it. Buying something with BTC also gives you an amazing feeling because you believe in the currency, and getting the option to pay with BTC just warms your heart!

This a 1000 times. There is no way to understand something better then doing it, and learning the fundamentals behind it. Snatching up a Raspberry Pi and a Block Erupter will set you back $60, but you will learn a LOT about mining, Raspbian, Terminal and Linux in general. This knowledge alone is worth more then the $60 you paid for the installation.
@_date: 2013-12-07 23:31:43
You can ofcourse expand your installation with more USB Block Erupters, and as stated in the article you can also use the Pi with Butterflylabs for example. The main advantage of the Pi is that it is a very power efficient device that makes no noise, doesn't get hot, and barely takes power.

Hopefully the price will rise to a 1:4th of the price of BTC, like it should through supply and demand
@_date: 2013-11-06 10:43:07
I would say: a subscription is 200$, pay in USD or BTC
And then just let bitpay or any other payment processor convert the 200USD to the current bitcoin price
@_date: 2013-10-30 13:45:49
1. Definitely yes, Now is the right time.
2. Price is volatile 
3. Make a backup of your wallet.dat on a usb stick, and password encrypt your wallet
4. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:54:57
You make a valid point. How would I go about this? Would writing today's date on the paper wallet be sufficient, or do I need to contact a lawyer to make it an official document or something?
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:07:19
Wow! Thank you so much! This is why I love the Bitcoin community, sending some guy on the internet money for his newborn nephew, Awesome!
@_date: 2013-08-17 17:31:57
I have send them $5 through Bitcoins just to get the sims 3 for mac :D Awesome to buy cheap games with bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:56:14
+0.01 BTC verify
