I think it's probably more to do with folks downvoting an obvious circle-jerk post which adds nothing to the topic of the subreddit itself.

Same here. Conflicted. It makes a lot of sense and is very simple and would scale well at different sizes. But as others have mentioned I think it treads too closely to things many of us have doodled at one point in our (young) lives.

GAW is an ISP, nothing more. They knew very little about mining when they started contacting devs on BitcoinTalk in March of 2014. They are not economics folks, much less crypto or mining folks. They are just guys who had the money and electricity to get the marketing and mining going.

iOS apps can only embed WebKit / Mobile Safari, so I'm not sure how it could perform (much) better than stock Safari. Even Chrome on iOS is hampered by the same limitation. Opera Mini gets around it by essentially serving up images that are generated by a server that sits in the middle.

Exactly. Automated testing is only a part of the total QA picture.

Push notifications on Android require GCM - Google Cloud Messaging. And Google Cloud Messaging currently requires Google Play Services.
The author would have to choose or write an alternative implementation of push notifications including queuing and delivery, and to do so with only the users who refuse or cannot install Google Play services in mind.

They're on Twitter too, which seems like a good way to get public visibility. Use the hashtag

You are correct. I guess it really depends on how much you are ready to spend. If you wanted to build a 2.5 Gh/s PC it woud cost around $1,500 with 4 GPU's. That's $1 for 1.66 Mh/s. That's still better than these USB drives. Doing 2.5 Gh/s using these drives would cost around $2,150 USD.

I just issued charge-backs &amp; disputes with 2 credit card companies, 1 bank, and PayPal. Took maybe 30 minutes total. My only wish is that it takes BFL far longer than that to deal with.
Felt good.

So you have a few options:
No Stratum: You can go into your Blade's web config page and enter pool hosts right there. You must always enter pairs under ports, server addresses, and user:pass. If you only have one pool, enter the info twice. This is an easy way to test your Blade but it will use the older GetWork protocol which is less than optimal.
Stratum Proxy: So you should setup a stratum proxy. You can do this with the latest version of bfgminer. Run bfgminer with the --http-port argument and supply a value, such as 8332. Pass in arguments for your pool or enter the information when prompted by bfgminer. Then, in the web config page for the Blade, enter the IP address of the machine that bfgminer is running on (again, twice, most always enter two sets of pool info).
Shameless plug: I introduced support for the Stratum Proxy in bfgminer in my latest [release]( of [MultiMiner]( You can enable the proxy in the advanced miner settings and the Blade will show up in the UI as a Stratum Proxy.

Called up my credit card companies yesterday and got all charges reversed in no time. I gave BFL the option to do something about it first. Money was back in my accounts within hours.

Those are instructions for USB Erupters, not Blades.

How are you getting that break even point? Are you factoring in the compounding difficulty increases?

Been using Cryptsy for ages. Never had a problem that wasn't solved in a Support Ticket.
Note that there is a lot of anti-Cryptsy FUD going on right now, including targeted campaigns against them on Twitter using bots. I wouldn't be surprised if the same started happening on Reddit...

I see your zip ties and I raise you [twist ties &amp; random piece of wood]( Works great though! 2.4 Gh/s.

Not to a degree that will make up for them costing 2x what a GPU does for hash/$. These are about 1.17 Mh/s for $1, where an AMD GPU of the same price (around $270 USD) will get you 2.22 Mh/s for that same $1.
And you can resell the GPU later.
