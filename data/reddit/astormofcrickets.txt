People aren't going to have the capacity to care about a speculative emerging currency or bleeding edge technology when they are concerned about how they are going to pay their mortgage or feed their families because they just got laid off. 
I think the idea that a catastrophe driving mainstream adoption of bitcoin is foolish. In 20 or 30 years when the idea of cryptocurrency is established in the public consciousness and when the network has the infrastructure, capacity, stability, and applications to handle it then and only then do I think crypto will fill this use case.
On top of that it would be catastrophic to investment in the bitcoin ecosystem.
@_date: 2016-04-23 10:11:53
Absolutely not. I'm very enthusiastic about the future and I think that a lot of good things are happening at the moment that will come to define a successful and mainstream Bitcoin of the future but like Gandalf says, "...even the wise cannot see all ends." My biggest fear is global recession and the collapse of the US dollar. The impact that would have on an emerging currency like Bitcoin would be catastrophic.

We have way more hashing power than the network really needs. Lowering the reward for it would drive off some mining but also help with the problem of major mining centralization I suspect.

Well, Pieter's email on the mailing list also suggested it would be paired with a 4mb block so assuming that makes it into the details of the scalability road map, I think it does buy time. It may not be optimal but it's doable and nothing else appears to be.
@_date: 2015-12-17 12:37:57
It seems unlikely that intelligent investors would move into bitcoin in huge volumes given that its a hugely volatile. On the whole I would say that a recession is bad for bitcoin because it means less investment in bitcoin businesses and infrastructure.

I think it quite effectively solves the problem of the FBI seizing the server and taking a huge percentage of the dark net listings down at once.
It also standardizes multisig transactions in such a way that all these individual nodes (that you are calling individual marketplaces) can't run off with your BTC. 
You make some decent arguments but you miss the point which is that this does indeed represent a greater degree of decentralization than what is traditionally available on the dark web. 
It's like arguing that Bit Torrent is really fundamentally no more decentralized that Kazaa or Napster...of course it is. You are just being silly.
@_date: 2015-12-22 00:22:51
This makes a lot of sense considering your behavior the other day on the open bazaar thread. Typically I would be more interested in the technicals of a project than their PR but that conduct was disgusting considering your motivations.
@_date: 2015-12-22 12:25:00
IDK, Pieter talked about that in his talk in Hong Kong though. I don't remember what the discount he suggested was. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 10:39:13
My personal opinion is not yet. Maybe at the halving after this but that's just like my opinion man.
It does need to happen before reduced block rewards start making it unfeasible for large chunks of the hash rate to stay on the network and maintain the security....but again that's dependant on the price as well.
I think you need a Max block size to a impose scarcity that wouldn't exist without it. Otherwise, you would probably bottleneck on CPU usage for verification and that sounds disasterous in terms of centralization.

You seem like a decent person and I really enjoyed the DevCore videos you guys put up on your youtube channel so I will tell you what I think.
I think that there is no way that I, or many others, would ever donate to your organization as long as it has the reputation as being the "good ol' boys club' that it was when Kerpeles was on the board. 
I will admit that I don't know much about the specifics of your bylaws but I have heard that the structure of your organization is such that it gives very little voice or power to your individual members and a great deal of power to the original or existing board. Right or wrong, you aren't going to change that opinion by telling people that you already have opened up or by trying to explain to people that "this is just how boards operate".
With all the controversy going on these days, it has become clear to me that Bitcoin still needs something like the Bitcoin Foundation but I'm just not comfortable giving you money in your current form. Especially, when you go and do silly things like booting Oliver from the board. He had more legitimacy with regular Bitcoiners than the rest of your organization combined because of his openness and dedication to serving the people who elected him. That should have been the most valuable asset that the Bitcoin Foundation has left because right now what you need is the community's support. The fact that you couldn't see that leads me to believe that the people who run this organization are more interested in serving themselves than the community.
@_date: 2015-12-23 02:34:45
Looks good to me. Now make it happen!
@_date: 2015-12-16 09:17:41
Nonsense. The only thing preventing people from issuing shares on the bitcoin blockchain is the US government. Don't pretend that its some special thing because its been done that way in the past.
Fundamentally speaking we are moving into a world where more and more things will have ownership registered on the blockchain. There is nothing all that unique about this use case save for how much entrenched power has been accumulated around the old ways of doing it.
@_date: 2015-12-22 02:54:00

Nobody wants to break the network effect of bitcoin by either migrating to an alt-coin or by irreconcilably forking bitcoin. You shouldn't either because it would have a terrible effect on the price, on the services available, on the investment in the ecosystem, and on the perception of the currency by the general public. Like it or not we are all better off with each other (and our investments in the ecosystem) around, whether we agree or not. We just have different opinions on what bitcoin should fundamentally be. While it may sound irreconcilable, it might not be.
What we need is the ability to run multiple consensus systems at the same time without breaking the network effect. This is a technology that is indeed possible and it may just be possible to make it trust-less as well.
It is one of the ideas that has been floated about the use of side-chains. It could be that the consensus mechanism of the main chain in bitcoin does not need to make different engineering trade-offs that sacrifice things like capacity for security. Instead we could use side chains optimized for micro-payments, and a different chain for storage of wealth etc. One chain might support extraordinarily high transactions per second while the second is fundamentally more secure. Its the best of both worlds and it's what we should be focusing our efforts on.
..but I'm not a core developer so wtf do i know.
@_date: 2015-12-17 13:55:46

I read somewhere that they are shooting for the end of January. I installed it today on my computer and it looks really nice. I mean aesthetically its really good looking.
I can't figure out how to find a list of moderators so I'm not sure you can buy anything yet, and more importantly TOR integration is not in the system yet. You are responsible for your own IP. I am running a server and I can watch IP's for nodes when I load their store. Most are probably behind VPN's but it's an inferior level of anonymity atm.
On the whole I am way more excited about this after playing with it that I was before. This is gonna be really cool.
@_date: 2015-12-18 04:46:13
No, you seem to be upset and dancing around the fact that lots of dynamically interconnecting nodes are inherently more decentralized than one single server the FBI can sieze.

@_date: 2015-12-22 02:25:03
The advantage that I can see is that using side-chains to deal with these types of problem can show that the solutions work at some scale before having to endanger the core consensus rules of the main chain.

Well I expect that as a part of the leadership, you have a much better understanding than myself of the particulars of this situation. However, I think my portrayal of the foundation, right or wrong, is an image problem that is shared by a large part of the community who might otherwise be members and donors. 
Anyway, best of luck. The more stuff the foundation does like devCore, the more interested I would be in supporting them.

What specific steps are you taking to avoid the mistakes of the past? Specifically,  the misuse and squandering of a very large amount of bitcoin. What kind of transparency can your members(industry/individual) expect in regards to their investment in the new BTC foundation.
As the foundation recently lost both of its recent class (c) individual member board appointments and then canceled (or moved back) the election to replace them. What future assurances can you make that your members will be given their rightfully had say (in proportion to your industry members) in the operation of the foundation and that their mandates in the future will be respected?
@_date: 2015-12-17 15:57:17
@_date: 2015-12-22 01:02:42
It's great to see a compromise that can buy enough time to finish side chains. In the future these kinds of disputes may well be decided by choosing your own preferred consensus machine without breaking the network effect.
@_date: 2015-12-16 09:10:18
The token is not required to be a full bitcoin. The stock token could be theoretically represented by as little as one satoshi of value (0.00000001 BTC).
Its important to note that bitcoins don't really exist, there are only bitcoin transactions and encumbrances on those transactions.
@_date: 2015-12-18 06:31:29
Yes it is peer to peer which is fundamentally different than a web server with a Bitcoin plugin(as you were asking someone else) in that it is more decentralized.
Since OB is in development certain features such as the use of the DHT table to store the contents of your store on the network when a user is offline have yet to be implemented.
So just stop with the FUD. It's obvious to me that you don't understand enough about the technology involved to make a technically coherent argument.

You can argue all you want about inflation being good for the economy but its never good for the individual saver. All things being equal, in a world where there are more deflationary options, people will not choose to store money in bankCoin unless it too is deflationary. 
bankCoin won't be deflationary and I'm not worried.
@_date: 2015-12-21 01:30:28
Well, I wasn't there and I don't really follow the bitcoin foundation news all that closely but I would find it hard to trust the foundation to manage money appropriately without a plan.
So the statement: 


Is still a matter of interpretation and to me the departure of both of the elected leadership on the same day at the same time says a lot about the current foundation and it's not good.
I think calling for an actionable plan to save the foundation prior to collecting money is the only responsible thing the foundation could have done. The Bitcoin foundation does not exist to server the people who work there with a paycheck, it exists to be a liaison in between the bitcoin community and the rest of world. It has been a gigantic colossal failure and that's sad because it could have been really important staple of the community without all the good'ol'boy nonsense that has gone on over there over the years.

Listen, I agree that there have been discrepancies but that is life. People are complex and nothing in the real world exists without aspects in which certain people would call contradictory.
Wright needs to provide satisfactory proof that he is Satoshi, the burden of proof is on him. However, nitpicking and trying to piece together Gavin's thoughts and motivations without accurate facts is a useless exercise.
Gavin has admitted that it is possible that he made a mistake. Did he say that because he is worried that he missed something or is he just being open and honest enough to admit that he is fallible? How the fuck could anyone possibly claim to know that unless they know him personally?
You cant, this is all speculation.
@_date: 2016-05-04 23:27:23
Please don't misconstrue this as an attack. I have a world of respect for all of the developers and all the intelligence and hard work they are applying to make bitcoin grow.
However, can you see that what you are asking is for bitcoin users to do is to trust you? In many ways I do trust the intelligence and honesty of core but I shouldn't have to trust you (and by you I mean core). I understand that this isn't a perfect world and Bitcoin is still centralized in many ways but what you are suggesting is that we trade some measure of decentralization in core for security and I think that if we continue down this road we are likely to get neither of them in the long run.

@_date: 2016-05-03 04:05:50
Is it possible that Gavin is a software engineer and not a spy? Is it possible that Wright had knowledge that Gavin thought only Satoshi would have and that made him more trusting of the verification?  Is it possible that Wright is a expert con artist and used misdirection to fool Gavin and the rest? Is it possible that Wright is Satoshi and tomorrow will sign a message with a key in a way that removes all doubt?
Who fucking knows, I don't know and none of you do either. I'm remaining skeptical and waiting on better evidence in a reasonable timeframe from Wright before I make up my mind. While I wait, I'm inclined to trust Gavin's judgment. 
Shame on the rest of you for making up your minds and throwing around these kinds of accusations without all the facts.
@_date: 2016-05-04 20:45:04
This may very well be true but the circumstances surrounding what happened contradict this explanation, as valid as it may be. It looks to be, as far as I can tell, a political move and like it or not core has been rather political for a while. 
What needs to happen is his commit needs to be restored then there needs to be a procedure put in place for the removal of commit access from developers. I'm not sure exactly what that should look like but pretty much anything is better than Peter Todd tweeting all that drama to the world in such an unprofessional manner.
@_date: 2016-05-03 05:04:41
The entire reason I posted was to make it clear that I, nor anybody else without inside information, has any idea why Craig Wright or Gavin have acted in this fashion. It is indeed deserving of some degree of skepticism.
However, skepticism != making accusations with incomplete or inaccurate information.
**Either Wright will sign a message with Satoshi's keys or he will not because he is not Satoshi Nakamoto** The burden of proof is on him because he is the one claiming to be Nakamoto. 
@_date: 2016-05-04 19:49:02

@_date: 2016-05-03 04:56:05
Maybe Satoshi doesn't meet all of your expectations? If Wright signs a message tomorrow with the private key used in the genisis block then I am going to be inclined to believe that he is satoshi, regardless about weather or not he lied about having academic degrees or access to super computing clusters. It's possible that he is as Gavin stated in his blog post "...an imperfect human being just like the rest of us".
@_date: 2016-05-03 07:23:20
Well yes, but I think you need to provide a reasonable time-frame in which to respond but essentially you are correct, it's up to him to prove irrefutably that he is Satoshi. If I had private keys like that they would not be easily accessible and my guess is (if he is satoshi) that he doesn't walk around with them.
My point was never that Wright is or isn't Satoshi. It's that accusing Gavin of gross negligence of the public trust without all the facts is a useless exercise until more is known about the circumstances surrounding Wrights "I am Satoshi day" are revealed.
@_date: 2016-05-03 05:24:04
Yes, but we just don't know the circumstances. I agree it does sound somewhat suspicious but on the other hand... If I was Gavin and Wright new things about your private communications with satoshi that were not public record you might be inclined to believe that a factory seal on the box was good enough for reasonable certainty. We just can't say because we don't know all the facts.
@_date: 2016-05-03 09:26:22
@_date: 2016-05-03 05:34:27
I agree, it's suspicious what Wright did with his blog post. It's not the evidence he claims it was. He should be given a reasonable amount of time to correct his mistake. If he fails to do so he should be outed publicly as a fraud and maybe Gavin has some questions to answer.
@_date: 2016-05-03 05:40:11
Give it a day or two, if Wright hasn't proved beyond any shadow of a doubt that he is Satoshi then that would be the time to ask Gavin more detailed questions about why he vouched for the man.
As it is you are not doing anything more useful than trying to sell pitchforks to peasants.
