This should *shock* everyone over at r/BTC. According to them, you cant do this without paying huge fees and waiting an eternity. Can you elaborate more on your experience?

The article shows in their example how you pay 15% round trip in fees. Isn't there a typo in bitmex's fee chart and the medium article?   If you put a % symbol at the end of the number 0.075 - thats not 7.5 %, thats .075%. Am i right? Arent bitmex and the author making the same mistake by either including a % sign or with the placement of the decimal??

Are you sure about this? I thought the long term cap gain rate was 15%, regardless of other factors. In other words, you get a 25% discount on cap gain taxes by holding for over 1 year (15% instead of 20%). If my only income was the proceeds from long term cap gains, i would be taxed at 15%; If I had other income that puts me in the 28% tax bracket, these gains are still taxed at 15%. Correct me if I am wrong, please.

Aren't the CME BTC futures just going to be settled in cash? I didn't get any sense that futures will be settled in bitcoins.

This makes sense from the perspective of a bitcoin investor, who can only spend bitcoin (cannot spend fiat - think darknet markets, for example), but does not want to reduce their BTC position with a purchase. Otherwise, why would anyone want to take 2 steps to accomplish what could be done in one step?
