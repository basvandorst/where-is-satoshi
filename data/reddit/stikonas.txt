And then you'll end up with two inputs in the end instead of 1. If you want to spend it, you'll need to pay more. So segwit discount will be mostly lost.

That's true but I don't think that's the reason the block number is not included. It's just not necessary to include it. Why waste a few bytes on something that doesn't play any particular role in the protocol.

So why would you cash out and reinvest again. You'll loose on exchange fees.
When you do transaction and convert bitcoins to USD then you have to pay capital gains tax.
P.S. I'm not a lawyer.
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:31:19
Well, whether it is exactly 0% is an open question indeed. But so is survival of humanity then.
If the Universe continues expanding, all the stars would eventually burn up, we'll be left with black holes and eventually they'll evaporate too, leaving us with almost empty universe with occasional low energy photon and even more ocasionally some other particles. Sounds quite boring Universe and not a long term success...
If the Universe stops expanding (unlikely from current observational data) and starts contracting, then that's sure end of the universe. Ok, there is a small chance that 
 universe bounce back to expanding state once it reaches Plank energy density. But we can as well call this a new universe... Nothing would survive this Big Crunch.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:41:03
Yeah, you can go to university in Germany. Become tax resident there and then cash out without paying capital gains tax. Then return to UK.

Somebody should write a Qt desktop client that just reads blocks from bitcoin core dir. That would be the safest explorer.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:48:26
Well, yeah. They won't see any new transactions. But still this makes fork less risky than hard fork. You only need 51% of mining power to support it. Not like 95% or even more.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:43:05
The queue might clear up over holidays. You are also not using segwit, so that is not helping.

Well, UK does not consider you a tax resident if e.g.
* You were resident in the UK in one of more of the three previous tax years, and you spend fewer than 16 days in the UK in the tax year under consideration;

To be honest Visa should be able to process way more than 56 ktps. It's just that there isn't more depand. So why would people send billions tps via LN. I don't plan on sending a transaction every few seconds (population of the earth is less than 8 billion).
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:13:20
No, I don't think they have. At least not exactly this. Well, Segwit has something slightly similar but less extreme. There is that witness part which old clients don't see.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:28:02
That's true. But it's not really blocking a development of ln (it happens on testnet anyway). Well, it does block a bit in a sense that devs are distracted.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:07:13
Increasing available block space does not require a hard fork. Segwit technically increases block size to 1.7 MB. Well, depends on what you mean by block.

Well, yes, it is a second order concept. That's not a new thing in bitcoin though. git also uses hashes for commits. And in fact there unlike in bitcoin you can have merges, so to get to some commit you might need different amount of steps depending on which branch you take and different people would not agree on "revision number". In bitcoin we never have block merges, only temporary splits, so unlike in git, everybody does agree on what is the block number.

@_date: 2017-12-15 19:03:34
Well, you can do everything with softfork. Even increase block size. Something like segwits 1.7 MiB increase, just more extreme version.

Well, so let's say first 50k blocks have 1 million transactions. Blocks 350k - 400k might have 10 million transactions, so it takes 10 times longer to verify. (Note numbers are made up but the idea is the same). For each transaction you need to check whether the signature is correct, I think this i the most expensive operation in veriying whether the block is valid

Well, it's mostly a matter of picking a distribution and installing it.
Picking your distribution might sound a bit scary, since there are so many of them... But it's quite easy to try a few and see what you like.
Unlike in Windows, GNU/Linux also has a choice of different desktop environments. Most distributions use either Gnome or KDE Plasma (personally, I use Plasma since it feels more powerful to me but that's my personal opinion, and I might be biased).
This is how gnome looks like: [
and this is how kde looks like [ (by the way, this distribution is KDE Neon, they build on long term supported version of Ubuntu/Kubuntu but provide latest version of KDE Plasma desktop)
And to install, you basically download iso, burn it to your DVD or USB stick and boot it, something like this
The installer asks a few simple questions, and then asks you about partitioning your hard drive. You basically can either remove whatever OS existed before or shrink partitions where your current OS is installed and  install GNU/Linux alongside.  
(I don't use Kubuntu at the moment, I'm on Gentoo, but Gentoo is almost surely too advanced for first distro).
Also worth reading about Free software in general:
(And here free does not mean no cost, although usually it comes at no cost, free refers to freedoms to use, modify and distribute your software)

IPv6 addresses (that look like 2a02:c7f:280f:a401::1) are public (although there are also local addreses too) but all devices get a globally routable IPv6 address.

Hmm, or maybe he proposes to change proof of work algorithm so that again everybody can mine on CPU.
@_date: 2018-03-01 21:33:22
So how do you propose to store password? Encrypted? The problem is with what, where do you get your encryption key? Whatever algorithm you use to "decrypt", malicious program will be able to use too.
At best you'll have security by obscurity which should never be your only defense (anybody can reverse engineer security by obscurity if they bother).
@_date: 2018-03-03 15:24:28
This is just security by obscurity. The binary is there for everybody to inspect, so it would be possible to extract that hardcoded passphrase.
@_date: 2018-03-01 21:46:32
So tell me with what you are encrypting it? You need a key, a passhprase (say 30 characters to get something like 128 bit security). Where will your program get it?
And nothing is encrypted in bitcoin itself. Cryptographic signing is used, yes. Hashes are used too. But not encryption. Of course wallets can and must encrypt your private keys. But you need to enter passphrase **every time** you use your bitcoin. You can't store the passphrase safely.
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:11:50
Yeah, could be. The thing is that users must be aware of these issues. And Ver has no interest in making users aware of this. But I suspect many other mobile apps similarly suffer.
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:09:01
That's not what the argument was.
The argument is that you can't safely store the seed. Either you enter it (or something equivalent) every time you use. Or your security will be low in any case. Even 6 digit pin is easy to bruteforce. That's just 1 million different PINs and you can easily bruteforce it in seconds on faster hardware.
Bitcoin Core does not store encryption key. You enter your password every time you use it.

Fitting exponential is still a linear regression. You can still fit it using least squares (
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:46:07
And yet it converges. It's just a geometric progression. You can find the sum even if there are infinitely many terms.
For example if tax is 20% after the end of this infinite cycle you would pay 25%.
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:25:16
Well, unless the app stores the seed in a hardware store, plain or not plain wouldn't make too much of a difference.
Everything that wallet program can decrypt without any other input (say some other passphrase), can always be done by other program with root access which can just do the same steps as wallet program to decrypt encrypted text to plain text. So either you enter some long password each time you send funds, or otherwise plain text wouldn't make it any more insecure.
@_date: 2019-01-28 00:36:19
Not sure what you mean by software store on Linux. But official distribution package archives are trustworthy. You have to trust them. (Third party repos is another thing).
E.g. gpg comes from your distro package archives. If you don't trust it, you won't be able to verify gpg downloads anyway (maybe gpg is backdoored by your distro to report good signature on fake bitcoin tarballs). If you don't trust your official distro package archive, you shouldn't be using that distro. E.g. then use source based distro or even compile the whole GNU/LInux distribution yourself without any distro (aka Linux from scratch). Even then you have to start from something, you must start with some trusted compiler from some distro package archive.

Exactly.  I would say give people at least 6 months to upgrade. Some get bitcoin from their Linux distributions. That's why it is much better to do it segwit way, than e.g. rushed Segwit 2x which had such short timescale. Hard fork just can't work in such short timescales.

1) Browsers were correctly warning users that certificate is invalid. If you log in to sites with invalid certificates, of course it's your fault. The same would be true if you try to login to bank or email.
2) Don't use web wallets and this particular attack wouldn't work. Full nodes are not vulnerable to DNS hijacking.
@_date: 2017-05-07 01:47:22
Full node doesn't download that much. Maybe 300 MiB per day. Even with block size increase it will still be very little. Even on slow DSL connection (let's say 1 MiB/s) downloading 300 MiB would take just 5 minutes.

Yes, you need to pay bitcoin transaction fees. Right now they are fairly high due to stalling of bitcoin scaling proposals by some miners.
@_date: 2017-05-09 19:55:26
Yeah... If you have more inputs then your transaction is larger, so fee/size is smaller. If it is too small you might need to wait till weekend when bitcoin is less congested. Over the weekend even minimal fee of 1 satoshi/byte might work.

Exactly, full "listening node". The post above mine clearly talks about pruned node if hard drive space is not an issue. Anyway, it's 10 GiB upload now on my node running at home during the day (I turn off my laptop over night). Btw, my node also signals UASF.
@_date: 2017-05-05 12:24:22
Prunning cuts bandwidth significantly too. Full node has much higher upload than download. Once you enable prunning your upload basically drops to 0.

By the way, this change address is needed for resiliency against quantum computer. Once you spend from address, your public key is known, so quantum computer can crack your private key. On the other hand, if money is sent to a change address, then there are no more funds in the previous address even if it is cracked. And you don't release public key for the new change address till you actually spend funds again.

Technically, every hard fork can be "done" as a softwork. Just like block size was increased last year with soft fork.
You can just add a new block with a new rules (like segwit witness section but even more extreme) together wtih the old block and do not accept any transactions in the old blocks (only write down the hash of a new block or something like that). So old clients will accept empty blocks but will not see new transactions until they upgrade but upgrade itself only needs 50+% of hash rate, not 95+% or so required for hardfork.
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:53:49

Well now we need 209 blocks out of 262. Probability to mine i blocks with 80% hash rate is
262! / i! / (262-i)! · 0.8^i  · 0.2^(262 - i)
E.g. probability to get exactly i=209 blocks is about 0.06
Now sum i from 209 to 262. And you'll get the probability.
At the moment I get 0.57.
P.S. I used the following code in Maxima computer algebra system
    p:0$for i: 183 thru 224 do p:p+binomial(224, i)*0.8**i*0.2**(224-i)$p;

Hmm, strange. That page says Lithuania at  22Mbps. I know my dad gets 300 Mbps for like €13... And basically everybody can get fibre to the premises so cheaply.

So how would state actors know be able to prepare their ASICss in advance... And they definitely can't attack using general purpose computers. State actors would be roughly the same as Jihan...

Except that it is much easier to run full node. Setting up mail server is more complicated. You need to install mail server itself (e.g. postfix), then IMAP server (e.g. dovecot), spam filtering, then opendkim to sign those emails. And most importantly you need to connect all these individual components into one piece, so that incoming mail will go from mail server to spam/virus check then gets correctly sent to IMAP server.
That's a few hours of work. Setting up full node takes a few minutes.

It can't really be less than 10 minutes on average even with empty blocks as block time is 10 minutes on average.

Almost surely miners will start rejecting blocks that don't signal segwit BIP141 after another 3 days. If this happens we will not see a hard fork.
There is always a small chance that something unexpected happens. But we should be safe for now.
@_date: 2017-07-20 20:20:59
No, nothing changes. It's just another variation of UASF but with miners doing the same thing. Like UASF, once it has done it's job it's not too relevant.

Well, Mars is much closer.

I'm also not a lawyer. But I think it also depends on the country... Like you said in US they might have short vs. long term capitals gains. But I don't think they have it like that in UK and the time since investment doesn't matter.
@_date: 2017-07-05 18:34:06
There is still capital gains tax...

I would guess it's bitcoin core wallet. I would suggest trying it... At least to see if it is recognized. As for downloading the block chain, you can probably export private keys once your wallet is recognized... But if you have no internet caps downloading blockchain is not too bad.

It is hard to include backdoor in a free/open source program and even harder to do that in a popular programs that are shipped by distros. If you run just up-to-date trusted free/open source software then hacking Linux is really hard. I'm not saying it is impossible, a lot depends on what is between the screen and the chair.

Don't think it's that simple after you executed malware. It might have encrypted files in home folder by that time...
@_date: 2017-07-20 22:14:08
14.2 is fine. I'm still running UASF for a bit longer until segwit locks in. Core does not know about BIP 98 but it doesn't have to.
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:51:21
Hopefully, but let's wait till BIP141 signalling goes to 100%.
@_date: 2017-05-11 11:10:14
Only in some and only cheapest plans. But yeah, there shouldn't even be data cap on cheap plans.
@_date: 2017-06-02 18:29:25
hard forked.
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:32:15
The amount in USD does not matter. The amount in BTC does not matter either. It depends on the number of inputs. But yeah, we need Segwit and then increase block size.
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:31:49
Well, it might be that distro packages version 14.1...

Well, half of these nodes are actually running core. The other half... There is a chance that they will be down due to a bug as is becoming usual.

Some other sources will say it is a good idea (
By the way, I don't work in IT industry (although I am KDE developer in my free time) and I set up my own mail server. After initial set up it doesn't need much maintenance (especially single user server), so I wouldn't agree to your link.
@_date: 2017-06-05 16:11:22
Well, they use half-meter diameter fibre wires:
@_date: 2017-06-02 18:22:10
Yes, it is not that hard to get basic email server running. Something like "apt install postfix dovecot" and basics are working (well,later you need to configure a bit more to get spam protection, etc...)

Price of computers/electronics is also falling all the time. Does that mean people wouldn't buy them.
@_date: 2017-07-20 09:59:43
It's more important to enforce instead of just having uacomment. Even older versions almost always see other UASF peers.
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:36:50
You just don't notice all the other 99.7% of time when it doesn't happen.
@_date: 2019-05-20 22:35:31
You are exposing it in both cases. But in one case the remaining address is empty (or will be empty within minutes as soon as transaction gets confirmed), so who cares. Nothing to hack there anymore.

Well, get the money out of politics, so that ISPs wouldn't be able to buy politicians and FCC and then do whatever they like.

Just do this on raspberry pi. It will take a bit longer than on pc but it doesn't matter.
    git clone  bitcoin_bip148
    cd bitcoin_bip148
    git checkout 0.14-BIP148
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make

2330 qubits in really a lot. It goes much harder to keep quantum computer working with every additional qubity you add.
@_date: 2017-06-20 10:55:13
Segwit2x will signal both bits if I am not mistaken. And will reject non-signalling blocks (so effectively  doing their own version of BIP148 too). That should make it compatible with all clients.

In principle if your keepass password is long enough and is only for keepass it should be safe. Both AES256 and ChaCha20 encryption algorithms are safe even againt quantum computers.
I myself wouldn't use cloud. I just have external hard drive to do my backups (hard drives are encrypted with LUKS). And I keep my old backup harddrive in another location, so I can still recover some files in the unlikely situation you described.
@_date: 2019-05-20 22:15:20
Because you are exposing the public key of your address. While public key is less important than private key, exposing public key can be dangerous if quantum computers become capable enough.
If you send change to another address, the attacker has almost no time to crack your public key using quantum computing. The transaction emptying your old address should be already in mempool and hopefully confirmed.
