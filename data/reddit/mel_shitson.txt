In these dark times you made me smile, then I looked at the price and in the time it took me to contract the muscles necessary to form a smile the price dropped by another £100

I wonder when it will click for him?
“Damn what a bargain! Just took out another loan now that it only costs £35”

Fair enough it seems to be going back up now though!

Yeah looking at a graph and it is still to early to tell but it’s gone from a low of about £8600 back up now to £10000 so I have faith

What forecast? I only noticed it dip yesterday but I guess you were paying more attention?

The huge rise last year in price alerted literally everyone to btc. They don’t care about technical percentage drops and rises being similar, they just know that the value skyrocketed to £14.5k in December and is now limping around £6k and trending downwards. The naivety so many had is gone.  So it’s nuts to say that the only difference is the alt coins. but hey... you can all downvote as much as you like if it makes you feel better.

There are many different factors from 4 years ago though. Many alternatives. Terrible press. Huge crash in price destroying the illusion to many buyers that it was not just another boom and bust bubble. I think it’s wrong to assume that it will go back up and surpass the previous high just because it did well in a very different past.
Though I hope I’m wrong and I make back my losses!

No I’ve never heard that before. So You mean to tell me that selling something when it’s value is high is a good thing?? And buying something when it’s price is low is also commendable?!?! Christ man you should teach an economics class

Yeah when I bought in I made £400 so quickly I thought u was a genius haha. It is a lot of fun and addictive to constantly watch the price change. Though not so much fun now... if it goes back up then you can say you were one of the bravest men who charged forward when others retreated

Probably not the wisest time to invest
