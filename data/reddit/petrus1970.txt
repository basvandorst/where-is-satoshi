Happy to see here this optimism.  If all the people moving around the bitcoin market  were just as optimistic, all the bitcoin problem  would cease to exist.Unfortunately as I have already said in my previous comments  the market moves with the goal of profits  and profits derive from the losses of other people. When we were at 4400 (-2000 form the stable value of 6400)  I warned that stop losses were not triggered and a new minimum would arrive and I was right we touched 3500.  Today I have a more optimistic view of price trends and hopefully the price of bitcoin will go up probabily around 4200 / 4400. Anyway 3500 is not the price that TA indicates as the bottom. The whales will push even further down the price in the future  for this we must be ready to suffer before seeing our jewel come back to life!

No it didn't  hit my stops, and I think it didn't hit the stops of a lot of us (the believers). I'm a trader and so I buy and sell with high frequency. At the moment I think we reached a local bottom, I'm going to sell if the brice go above 4400 and wait for the next deep bottm (nearby 3000$). The price will reach the bottom when the believers will sell, approximately around 1,5k

Hello everybody, I'm new to reddit and honoured to be here in such exciting moment. The real price of BTC for me ? Really I don't know. I think nobody knows at the moment.  It is unlikely to go to 1k  but what is true, at this moment is that it is not convenient to undermine bitcoins, so I think we are at the beginning of a big crisis.  A great opportunity for far-sighted people .

Here we are. Again below 4000$. The last movement was fram 3500$ to 4300$. In my previous comment I told you that there is a period of 4 day 4 hour between each bitcoin drop during last week.    
The period has elapsed now is called to fall let's hope I'm wrong.

It lasts 4 days 4 hour between two bitcoin fall.  Last fall happened on 24 november so we are close to the 4 days 4 hour limit. I think that for at least 12 hours  we can expect a bull market. Then I hope it starts a side movement  this would mean that things are clamoring.

This is the bottom? I've been watching for a year bitcoin trying to understand if some of the TA rules, the one you can find in any book, really work. What I found is that for the moment nothing help me forecasting the future price. Mostly using TA you can understand  in the aftermath what happened. If I see the last two big bearish impulse, let me say  the one that brought the price from 6400 to 5400 and the second one from 5400 to 4400 they have different nature. The first was brutal and very fast, likely it triggered many stop losses. The second is a movement  dictated by the price maker, also brutal but no stop losses has been triggered for me. The believers  still are inside while the speculators are already out at the moment. In order to have a rebounce  in most cases price have to react immediately just after stop losses are triggered. In this case the reaction is too slow, and all make me think  we are taking a breath before a new deep fall. Anyway I'm not selling.
