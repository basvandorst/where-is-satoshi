Sorry, I've been away from Bitcoin for a while but I thought the first hard fork would necessarily include "zero coin" true anonymity. Wasn't that the promise of Bitcoin? What happened to that? If a hard fork is so difficult to arrange, wouldn't one include all of those ideas?
I feel like I'm taking Crazy Pills. We were talking about triple-entry accounting, the block-chain, banking without banks, IPFS, and inventing the future... Now we have an $xx transaction fee and all of this BS? WTF?!
It's like that South Park episode with the Vatican and the Giant Spider! How did we get here?

Because if it doesn't break that barrier there's no proof it isn't just bouncing down from 20k. If so it will continue down, taking a longer and more painful path down, down to ~7.5K, then maybe down to ~4.5k, and even $1.7k.
This is a real possibility no one wants to talk about since it is still up $10,255.43 over LAST YEAR.
Investors are supposed to buy low and sell high, and Bitcoin has been high all year, 100% of the time. It is high at 9.5k, it is high at 7.5k, high at 6.5k, and high at 3.5k. Something to keep in mind.

Well he could have sold and bought back in a lower price point.

For a second I thought "why is he shilling bitpay" then I saw it was b*tc*pay. I had the same confusion the other day with Circle vs Square. It's so hard to keep all these abbreviations and shapes straight.

They're saying he enabled money laundering, but they didn't even prove any money laundering actually took place.

This is the second time it failed to breach 11.8k. That means it hasn't recovered from the low of 6k. The smaller upward trends have not overcome the larger downward trend from 20k -&gt; 17k-&gt; so I would not bu surprised if it tests down at 7.5k.

Okay, so I have discovered the cure for cancer. But I won't tell anybody. I will keep it a secret and administer it for a fee so I don't get ripped off. If I get hit by a bus it will be lost forever.
Good luck with that.

This argument is winning me over. I don't want to be someone who, when the music stops, doesn't own Bitcoin.
I think my strategy going forward is to try and accumulate as much overall BTC as possible for the future.
Anyone who buys some now (and by "now" I mean this general epoch in time, not any particular day or price point.) has the opportunity to own more Bitcoin than 99% of humanity will ever have a chance to own. That amazes me.
I want to have the Super Premium Platinum Plus membership at a citadel.

On the other hand, all that Bitcoin having been frozen for so long when it should have been circulating on what was a top exchange could have contributed to the price rise in the first place.

No it's definitely the thing I said.

If you really believe that you have too little imagination.

I didn't say it was going to go down, I said it's at a key decision point, which it absolutely is.
You: hurr, durr can haz memez b dreemz!!
If you really think something can't return to the price it was at 1 year ago, you're an idiot.

When the music stops, it is fiat which goes to zero.

I think most do where it comes down to brass tacks. That explains a lot, doesn't it?
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:17:18
But I do believe in Bitcoin as either the future of money, or some equally important role in society that we can't understand yet- on the level of the telephone or the automobile.
Buying shitcoins is like buying a dot.mobi instead of a dot com.
Bitcoin is king.
I'm talking about looking at the bigger picture instead of getting hung up on minutia of the present day. However important they seem today.

Except the logistics are organized around domestic bases which are not firebases —they are not defensible.

People forget how much knowledge has been lost because it was kept secret and eventually taken to the grave.

So you're saying I should shave my head, grow my hair long, buy a collie dog, drop acid, date a chick with bell bottoms, wear baggy shirts, and join a dotcom?

Where can I check the buyer volume with a historical chart?

I've been saying for 5, 6 hours Bitcoin is going to go down but no one listens to me. It's going to go down, going to go up. Big league. Let me tell you. Let me tell you. All of the women on flirted with me — consciously or unconsciously.

Happy cake day bud. Cheers!
