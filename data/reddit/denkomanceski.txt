Just kidding its probably way more than that :D

No, we need gold so we can have a reference “digital gold”. Thats its only purpose this century.. than its job is done

@_date: 2019-04-10 00:06:34
No, the limited supply is limited to imagination. Exchanges are using fractional reserve.. what does it take for people to understand this. I can print as many BTC as I want on my exchange as long as I have enough to cover withdrawals.. OH THIS REMINDS OF THE TRADITIONAL BANKING.. no shit
@_date: 2019-04-12 13:39:47
Apple pay? Doesnt get better for me atm
@_date: 2019-04-10 07:35:54
Yep. Last time when proof of keys was happening, HitBTC disabled BTC withdrawals few days prior to the event.. also, we have too many people that are involved to get rich quick, so they wont even bother to learn what proof of keys is, nor ever transfer their BTC from exchanges

And since most of the people HODL and speculate, and in case of crisis they cant wait 1 hour = 6 confirmations to save their money, they keep it on exchanges. Also, mos of the legit exchanges are save, and have only 2-3% of the users’ assets in hot wallets
@_date: 2019-01-08 09:31:26
I put only 20$ so its fine. As long as its open source and has contributors, we should give it another chance. Just dont put huge amounts until its battle tested (time)
@_date: 2019-01-08 09:23:57
I havent seen a better wallet (both btc and ln)
Its open source
@_date: 2019-01-06 01:48:53
Also, statistically speaking, a lot of users will lose part of their holdings overtime.. because they want to trade (aka gamble, press red and green buttons), so the exchange can easily predict this, and “virtualize” X % of his holdings, and keep Y % coverage only of the underlying asset (in this case BTC)
Not to mention that to increase those odds, they can trade against the mass (of course by selling the hidden data like stoploses and what not to big trading funds that actually know what they are doing)

Guys, please realize that unless this industry is regulated properly, the bitcoin supply is not 17m.. probably not even close.. I can bet my life that the exchanges are “printing” bitcoins in their databases because people keep the BTC there.. they turn that into the well known fractional reserve system.. even if they have 20% coverage, they will probably do fine and noone will ever discover that they ponzified BTC.
P.S: A clue for this is HitBTC last week disabled BTC withdrawals on the proof of keys day - an initiative to move the BTC to our own addresses and not exchanges’. Why would they do that? They cant f***ing cover that many withdrawals.. they dont have that amount of BTC..
@_date: 2018-02-22 00:25:53
Is this valid: If you are that addicted to price checking, that means that you are invested more than you can afford to lose

Done! 
The world is digital.. as a human, we cant exist without digital anymore.. we just evolved into this new creature that cant live without looking at a screen (social media, news, videos..). Even kids dont know what to do with their lives without ipads anymore. Everyone has an “improved” virtual “self” character living in the cloud (ex. Instagram profile). Well, gold needs digital too.. but with a few improved attributes since in digital, we could be more creative than physics. Anyway, for non-techy people, its super hard to store and maintain this digital gold (its very similar with normal gold), so they are left waiting on the line and watch while others enjoy their new gold. 
By approving an ETF, you just allowed the planet to own the new gold without worries that they will lose it and not be able to protect it. 
Oh, and we are all aware that those ETF applications wont ever stop, so why waste your time and energy again in few months when another player submits a new application for it.
