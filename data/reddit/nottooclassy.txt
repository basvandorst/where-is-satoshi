Thanks for the reply. I'm just surprised that no one has talked about them before. They offer an arbitrage fund which supposedly returns 10% a year. Still haven't decided yet if its worth the risk.

Couldn't whoever received the bitcoin wallet theoretically have a program which instantly transfers the funds out of the wallet at which point the transfer would be complete ?

Why would it need to be forked? It's already intended to be a decentralized unrestricted market. I think it will start as a black market and slowly evolve.

While your at it, do you mind checking the price of Bitcoins in five years? I just think that OpenBazaar is something we should all be supporting as it will benefit everyone in the end.

Any one read the comments on the actual site ? It seems as if people are still convinced it's a Ponzi scheme smh. Someone might want to reply with the definition of what a Ponzi scheme is. Ignorance pisses me off sometimes.

My bad, does this go against the subreddit rules, should I delete it? I just thought it was a pretty awesome opportunity for everyone.
