Traded at localbitcoin in 2013-2017, up until they started requiring KYC/AML. Out of 100-200 trades, one issue, a guy gave we $1100 in fake dollars. Brought bills to the police station, haven't heard back from them.
@_date: 2018-10-24 04:32:55
I have a pen, but that was a relatively small transaction, and I traded with the guy before so kinda trusted him. He also put one good bill on the top of the pack. At home I saw all the other bills are forged. I checked the law and it says you shouldn't alert the seller in this situation, you should go straight to the police, which I did. Police officer who checked the bills pointed out the serial numbers are consequential, even though the bills are old - sure sign of a forge.

The "I bought $100 worth of Bitcoins, need Lambo" effect.
@_date: 2019-02-08 10:36:18
What I don't like, every time BTC goes up, Bitcoin dominance goes down. And the only time when dominance goes up, is when the price drops.      
Which shows this market is still pretty much driven by the alts and ICOs. This needs to change, but apparently we are still far away..
@_date: 2019-02-18 00:26:43
Well, such studies usually prepend policy moves. And the results of such studies are usually known in advance, because what exactly you measure and how, pre-determines the outcome. The study was launched in the first place not for pure science, but to support a specific agenda.  It's not real science, a lot of assumptions go in before the study even starts.
@_date: 2019-12-18 14:33:30

there were only two halvings so far. Too little to draw any conclusions about future. I don't think it will have any effect, 87.5% percent will be mined by then, and the rest will have less influence than demand originating from bitcoin's utility, which will either materialize or not.

What is the maximum payment amount that is guaranteed to go through the network? Maybe not 100%, but something like 99%, comparable to CC transactions?
@_date: 2019-12-18 13:29:45
I see several reasons why price is dumping. First, the LN project has not yet materialized. There are no coffee shops accepting Bitcoin via LN at every street corner. And some people are concerned if it takes so long maybe it will take forever. I.e. never.
Second, some people are concerned that maybe Craig W. will have access to Satoshi coins after all. Doesn't matter if he is real Satoshi or not, if he is a crook or dumb or whatever. The probability is not zero. And that means he will have to move a lot of them in January 2020.
@_date: 2019-12-18 14:29:09
about your second argument, if you have asked 1000 people about bitcoin in 2011, you would struggle to find 0.002 that genuinely believed it is money)
@_date: 2019-12-18 14:12:59
well, future potential is 100% tied to LN success, because without it Bitcoin's utility is zero. That's my concern. The only reason I have not dumped Bitcoins I held since 2011 is because of LN promise.    
Halvings impacting supply flow have zero influence because it is a public knowledge since Jan 2009 :)
@_date: 2019-12-18 13:58:47
I first mined Bitcoin in 2011 ... mostly it was a reversion to the mean after an irrational pump ... or some huge scam unfolding, like with MtGox case ... or fears of [China] government cracking down) ... but I don't think past predicts the future in Bitcoin case) Just laying out what might be in play this time.
The Craig W. concern should resolve by February. The LN concern should resolve eventually too, I believe.
There are also new Eu rules coming effect in January (all Bitcoin exchanges should apply strict KYC|AML ), so maybe some people who don't want to KYC, are dumping now. This should also resolve after NY.

@_date: 2018-11-24 05:42:18
Big merchants, or maybe even governments, can form a consortium to mine even when it's no longer profitable, to maintain the network and protect it from hackers. In that case, they can agree to keep most mining machines offline, to conserve energy.    
If an attack is detected, the sleeping power can quickly come online.

@_date: 2018-11-28 09:02:10
More than enough because there are few payments. Once payments volume grows, I suspect many channels will just dry out and LN would break.
