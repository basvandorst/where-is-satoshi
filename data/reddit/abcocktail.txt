How do you find out your private key for a public address?
Do you go digging into the wallet.dat file? Like open it in notepad++ or something?

I live in the USA. 
I haven't read up on openbazaar; just found out about it today. And I thought I read somewhere that it could be illegal, so I was jus tmaking sure.

Theoretically, yes. This sounds like something straight out of an economics textbook. But in the real world it doesn't always happen that way. Miners sometimes mine for the fun of it, or for the future expectation of profit. 
Also, it's possible to have a really difficult coin to mine but which is not profitable at current market price.

What is the difference between currency inflation and supply inflation? The way you explained it makes it seem like they are the same thing.

How do the operators, as well as Lamassu company, make money?
For example, would an entrepreneur have any interest in this machine?

I honestly don't understand what you're saying. Not that you're wrong but I don't get your argument. Let's go back to this quote of yours.


I don't think this is necessarily true. You're extrapolating coin value from increased network usage and scarcity, when value is based on the free market price. Just because something is scarce doesn't make it more valuable.

Coin value has nothing to do with difficulty.
