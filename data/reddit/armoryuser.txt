Does the full version 0.96.1 support the recent hard fork?   
2nd way of asking this question:  Within Armory version 0.96 (presently remaining with 0.96.04) And the recent 
hard fork, how does one find both the legacy BTC in our 
wallets and where does one find the new BCH? 
Is it possible to access both the legacy BTC and the new BCH coins from within the newest version Armory wallet? 
Thank you for your kind reply.

I found the updated information along the Right Side Bar regarding version 0.14.2 of bitcoin core, along with verifying the integrity of bitcoin core.  
Armory version 0.96 has now successfully been installed and seems to be operational, in conjunction with a verified copy of bitcoin core version 0.14.2  
Note a further question above - in a reply to one of the prior comments with topic about 
"Wallet Format Changes"

Thank you for the link to the most recent beta version of Armory.  I tried it and this is successful - confirmed by transferring some BTC between two of my wallets (all within version 0.96.0.4 for the on line Armory).  I hadn't yet upgraded the off line Armory to 0.96.4 for the experiment, yet all transferred correctly.     
This transfer also reflected correctly to my on line Armory legacy version 0.93.3 
Operationally this experimental version is quite similar to the legacy version of Armory, however absent a few of the confirmation warning screens before confirming the broadcast to Network (which warning confirmations do exist within the legacy versions).   
Thank you for the link to the beta version.  Looking forward to the full correction upgrade re version 0.96

Now that I have Armory version 0.96 operational on a separate set of on line and off line computers, I chose to upload the paper backups of my version 0.93.3 legacy wallets to the off line computer with Armory version 0.96 
I then created watching only copies of off line wallets (from the off line computer with Armory version 0.96) and imported those watching only wallets to the on line computer with Armory version 0.96.   Using Wallet Properties I identified that each of the On Line watching only wallets were mine.   
----- 
Here's the question.  It now seems the On Line Armory Version 0.96 gets trapped in some unknown routine when I attempt to create a new "Receiving Code" (Receive Bitcoins) for any of the on line Watching Only Wallets present in my On-Line Armory version 0.96 (with a verified bitcoin core version 0.14.2).   
Is there some addition action needed so Armory version 0.96 will function with legacy wallets in the same manner as it operates with Armory version 0.93.3? - or is it necessary to retain the Armory version 0.93.3 on the pair of legacy computers? at least through the week before and after the August 1 B148 transition? 
Thank you for your suggestions and input.

further clarification on the above request for assistance.  Installation is to a Win 10 computer.  Thank you to whomever can offer some sequence steps to permit Armory v 0.96 to properly index to the bitcoin core database on Win 10.  
Let me make a further correction from my first input for assistance.
With Win 10, we are using a 3 TB hard drive.
while v 0.96 continues to not recognize the bitcoin 0.14 database, armory v 0.95.1 does seem to recognize the database.
Yet all it does is to fully fill the first Green Bar of "Initializing Data Base"
exploring the program "process manager" it appears that information does get entered to the hard drive, but even after a couple of days (with a high speed cable modem) there remains no further progress into the 2nd progress bar of "Build Databases"
Again, thank you to whomever can suggest some step by step instructions on how to correctly install armory version 0.96 to a Win 10 computer with a 3 Tbyte hard drive.
TY kindly
We also observe that the bitcoin core database creates extreme fragmentation of the 3 TB hard drive.

difficulties installing V 0.96, or even v 0.95.1 of armory.  
Initially tried the same routines as installing 0.93.3 = Download armory, then from Armory download bitcoin core.  Let Armory index bitcoin core.   
Neither version 0.96, nor version 0.95.1 liked that sequence.   Then tried installing the version 0.14 bitcoin core database first &amp; unchecked the run bitcoin core.  Version .96 of armory doesn't recognize the 0.14 core database.  Version 0.95.1 seems to recognize the 0.14 core database, but gets stuck for a few days only in the first progress bar "Organizing Database" 
Is this really indexing the database, or just putting a collection of extraneous data to the hard drive.  
Is there a step by step sequence to make a first install of Armory version 0.96 to a newer computer?  Thank you for sharing that step by step sequence.    
This is intended to migrate a few version 0.93.3 wallets onto the armory 0.96, and then re-install Armory 0.96 onto two existing computers which are presently operating with Armory 0.93.3.  
Thank you for your suggestions
