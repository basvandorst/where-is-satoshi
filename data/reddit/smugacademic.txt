Unfortunately, retail banking technology in the U.S. is downright primitive compared to places like the U.K. For a big portion of the world, it is bizarre and shocking that Americans still write cheques.

"over the long term, the price keeps moving up and to the right".
To the right? You don't say!

Okay, sort-of, but not quite. Insider trading is a subset of trading on material nonpublic information, but the sets are not equivalent. Every instance of insider trading involves trading on material nonpublic information, but there exist trades based on material nonpublic information that are not insider trades. 
Example: suppose a terrorist decides that he is going to blow up an airplane and shorts the company's stock beforehand. Although this is morally odious and illegal on many levels, this should not strictly count as insider trading because the terrorist isn't a corporate insider; however the trade *would* be done with very material and very non-public information.
To be an "insider" you have to have a special relationship with the securities that you are trading, or have some relationship with somebody who does. It's not at all obvious to me that the MtGox people have such a relationship.

It's actually not at all obvious that this is insider trading, given that the assets that were sold weren't securities (e.g. stocks/bonds) issued by MtGox. 
To be an "insider", you have to have some fiduciary duty of care to the people who own the security: this is clearly the case with a corporate CEO trading on information about his company's stock. But MtGox is basically acting as a market maker. The legal duties that market makers owe to their clients is much fuzzier. See, for instance, the debate surrounding the Goldman Sachs ABACUS deal in the lead up to the financial crisis:

^ this is right. The social function of a bank is liquidity transformation: it issues long-term loans using short-term deposits. Without banks, there would generally be a mismatch in liquidity preferences between the people who want to *borrow* money (i.e. companies/homeowners who prefer to borrow for 10-30 years) and the people who want to *save* their money (regular folks who want easy access to their cash and don't want it tied up in long-term investments). Banks intermediate between those two groups, and fundamentally what they do has little or nothing to do with the currency they do those things with.

... maybe it's because deflationary currencies create enormous problems? No, you're probably right - it's obviously some conspiracy to enslave America.
