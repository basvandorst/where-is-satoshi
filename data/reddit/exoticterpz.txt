But I haven't tried sending wallet to electrum yet

Ok finally resolved.
Idk what the real problem was. But i highlighted the HD account and pressed the 3 circles in the top right corner to bring the drop down menu down and i pressed 'archive' and it instantly brought up my coins. All of them.
Thank you all for the help

When all this happened it was the version prior to the newest one. But after this happened i updated and made a back up.

Are you asking for the wallet ID address it was sent to?

I'm about to tonight but I've never done it so i have to fully read up on everything.
Do you have a link to directions and explanations?

I made the 12 word seed and 6 number code after all this happened...

Tbh im not sure if i had more than one account but I'm thinking yes. And I'm thinking when i pressed "reload account" and it wiped out my coin and transaction history, it actually wiped out my account. That's why it's showing zero btc and no transactions, when i had coin and many transactions.
I think this because i have mycelium on another phone and it has 2 accounts, one with all my transaction history and one with none.
Does that make sense?

You would think so right? That what it even sounds like. But i highlighted the HD account and pressed "archive" and it brought up my old keys (went from 3 to 14) and all my coin came up ( the transfer and the cancelled broadcast)

Also what i wanted to ask, does it have to be elrctrum?
I have mycelium on another phone, a completely different account. And that account is working fine. Can i use that wallet instead of electrum? Or it needs to be a different wallet?
