agreed.  just thought i would share some tidbits and help some people who are panicking move into some other safe bets.
in the crypto world things are wacky, but investing in disruptive tech is always a 'safe' move in my opinion.  obviously dont put in more than you're willing to lose.

To be honest, I'm still panicking a bit, these price increases before big news always sketch me out so I moved a bit into actual Bitcoin technologies versus crap alts.  
It's weird that nobody is mentioning diversifying as much as they should.  I dropped some into Civic, EOS, Karbon, and Augur.  
Edit:  Lol, yeah I didn't know much about Karbon either until I read their whitepaper, but it's some decent social media tech that could help adoption soar even more after this fork.
Edit 2: Forgot their link:

Yeah I thought it was an outright scam because of some try-hards here on reddit.  But apparently their tech is so good that they have actually been able to drum up negative shill campaigns from a bunch of other companies looking to fill the social space with crypto.

I know right?
I mean openbazaar is good an all, it's just not user friendly, and definitely not user friendly for moms/grandmas/great-grandmothers.
thats the killer app btc and all cryptos need, so this will boost adoption rates higher because the need for a bank to deal in ecommerce will be null.

LOL, how can you say the market is being unaffected?  scared non-Hodlers are moving to alts to 'have the illusion' of playing it safe, but we all know alts are just as susceptible as BTC, because BTC controls the market.  BCC will die without even a chance, sad to see really....im sticking with BTC because i'm a man, and men hodl.  
gentlemen..
