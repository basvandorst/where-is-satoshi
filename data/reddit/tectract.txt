You've missed my point. The miner fee incentive for miners to *prioritize* transactions. Right now if we just jumped to 8MB blocks, the standard fee expectation to get your transaction included in a block will go down by a factor of eight. That fee is one of the things driving the creation of third-party trust networks, which are essential to solving the problem of trustable *exchanges*. We need trustable exchanges just as much or more in the short-term than we need to reduce miner fees.

Coinbase is not a 3rd-party trust network. They are a regulated centralized clearinghouse. I'm talking about things like Open Transactions, with voting pools. Even Ripple was a half-decent implementation, minus a few major flaws. Once networks like that are up and running, and good, and trustable, most users will never even have to pay bitcoin transaction fees at all. Actual blockchain transactions will be used mainly for larger transactions and back-end settlements. This is the future, one way or another, 8MB blocksize jump only delays that future slightly. It also gives a slight disproportionate edge to the largest mining pools, as I understand.

People always have the choice of using an alternative client like btcd.

Sure, and if they stay flat for most of the 50-year period between 1950 and 2000, it means buying power was stagnant while real goods cost more every year.

The UTXO's are currently chosen somewhat randomly, when a transaction is created. Deterministic UTXO would mean that the UTXO's would always be predictably chosen according to a specific ruleset, so that when redundant multi-sig transactions are created across several servers, the UTXO's always agree. That's my understanding of it anyhow, I've never actually done dev on the core so I might be missing some important details there. I know this was a development effort in btcd, the GoLang node implementation, and the plan was to make a PR to bitcoin core eventually.

Well according to Neilsen's law, the internet top speeds will go up by approximately 50% per year, but average speed network speed grows more slowly than that. So the blocksize should increase by less than 50% per year at the absolute maximum so that bitcoin should theoretically never hit a bandwidth cap, but I was thinking a 10% or 20% increase per year would be pretty safe.

This is some interesting game theory. Thank you for this analysis, I'll have to go through it in some detail. Couldn't the rest of the network also just start blocking the IP of the offending pool, greatly reducing the effectiveness of such a policy?
@_date: 2015-06-02 09:41:48
My concern there is that Neilsen's Law only applies to the fastest possible speeds that any node in a network might achieve, it doesn't apply to the average network speed. I'm also weary that Neilsen's law might not hold up, or may reach a long plateau period at some point. Even Moore's law is questionable over the timeframe of a century. A more conservative limit seems fine. I might even be swayed that a *linear* rather than exponential increase may be sufficient. What is the maximum number of transactions per second that bitcoin needs to support? How large would the blocksize need to be to support, say, 100 million transactions per second? Do we ever really need to go further than that?

Actually, Neilsen's law only applies to the absolute fastest speeds acheivable by a network. Average network download speed grows more slowly than 50% per year, and upload speed is known to lag that growth also because there is little consumer demand.

That makes no sense. Essentially what you're saying is that stocks are expected to grow at a higher exponential rate than inflation, which is utter BS.

@_date: 2015-06-01 21:38:21
The need is for users to be able to trust exchanges. They wouldn't have to use the exchanges to do bitcoin transactions within a trust network, and the fees for such transactions will be orders of magnitude smaller than if they were included on the blockchain. We're not artificially limiting the volume, since blocks aren't currently being fully filled. A timed adjustment based on Neilsen's law right now would not limit volume now without the 8MB blocksize increase any more than it will far in the future where this early 8MB blocksize jump is irrelevant.
@_date: 2015-06-01 23:25:18
Whats the other party?
@_date: 2015-06-20 08:26:20
Yeah, ok, that's interesting. So then you'd have to look at the raw data for real wages and inflation numbers during periods to stagnant buying power to see if it was actually declining. I do believe you may be correct about  inflation numbers being cooked, but the raw numbers are what gets cooked when they tabulate inflation, though, so they make inflation purposefully difficult to tabulate correctly. It's well known that wage inflation lags price inflation though, so people are essentially constantly experiencing loss of buying power except in the rare moments they get a raise or change jobs and get a newly market-adjusted salary. I think we might see a different chart if we compared actual currency inflation, ala M3 numbers there, also, instead of reported price inflation of real goods.

I don't really agree with the idea that the system should be designed in a way that block overflow is always avoided.

I see the miner fee competition for transaction prioritization as a driver of innovation to create third-party trust networks that can actually be trusted.

I think 50% is just a little too high, because that puts us right on the line with projected internet speed growth of the *fastest* nodes in the internet. It should probably be less than 50% just to be safe about long-term bandwidth restraints. I guess my concern is that if bitcoin is eventually running near it's bandwidth limit, then a partial network interruption or temporary slowdown could render bitcoin "offline".

I'm not opposed to a hardfork to change the blocksize algorithm. I'm just opposed to this particular implementation of that change. We would just have to hard-fork again in the future for the exact same issue, and it will be orders of magnitude worse of a problem then, if we just kick this issue down the road. If the network is not robust enough to handle block overflow, that's an architectural weakness that should be addresses and the nodes should be hardened to handle block overflow better. I don't really agree with the idea that the network should be designed to never handle block overflow, because that eliminates the miner fee incentive mechanism.

When starting up a new bitcoin daemon, it's pretty standard to download the block data first and then just have your daemon scan it, instead of trying to download and verify every block sequentially through peer connections, which can take days to complete. This is basically just the same thing, but you are moving the files on a USB instead of just downloading them directly. You just copy / transfer any .dat files in the ~/.bitcoin folder to the new machine. Using a "lite" client offline would certainly not be possible, as they rely on servers to tell you the balance of your address. An "offline sync" button to generate a file which could sync your offline "lite" client would be interesting, I guess.

A change to *reduce* the maximum size limit seems like it could be done through soft-fork. I'm just not convinced that the blocksize needs to grow at 40% per year, though, or anywhere near that. I don't really think that the network should be designed to always avoid block overflow, because it eliminates any market incentive on transaction fees to be prioritized and included into the next block. It's also a vulnerability of the system if the nodes can't handle block overflow, which is a separate issue which should be addressed directly if there's a serious problem there.

Actually I think the recent developments could lead to a better FOSS product in the long-term. I don't really know whether Monetas is planning to roll out a FOSS *or* closed-source voting pool tech anytime soon, I always thought it was only some audit server service architecture stuff that was going to be closed off and proprietary, but that could all be changed now. They haven't been doing many press releases recently, I wonder if they got their updates to btcd completed and made a PR to bitcoin core for those multisig API features they wanted.
@_date: 2015-06-10 11:22:19
So if they pulled in the "confidential" transactions stuff, would that be a hard fork or a soft fork of bitcoin? Or is that just something that can only live in a sidechain? Do you know?
@_date: 2015-06-01 07:35:28
I'm not opposed to a hardfork to change the blocksize algorithm. I'm just opposed to this particular implementation of that change. We would just have to hard-fork again in the future for the exact same issue, and it will be orders of magnitude worse of a problem then, if we just kick this issue down the road. If the network is not robust enough to handle block overflow, that's an architectural weakness that should be addresses and the nodes should be hardened to handle block overflow better. I don't really agree with the idea that the network should be designed to never handle block overflow, because that eliminates the miner fee incentive mechanism.

Trezor does rely on centralized servers to check your balance, similar to Electrum. You control the private keys, though. It may be theoretically possible to sync an offline client using some sort of offline file transfer, I suppose.

Miners always have the ability to create blocks with any amount of transactions in them. No matter what the blocksize limit, they will always have this ability. In fact, there is an incentive for miners to keep the blocksizes small, because smaller blocks propogate faster and thus have lower chance of going stale. Even if blocksize was raised to infinity, miners would likely choose blocks with only transactions containing fees, and might even prune out some transactions that include fees in order to keep the blocksizes small enough to prevent stales.
@_date: 2015-06-01 23:47:24


It's a disincentive for the creation of third-party trust networks in the short-term because it artificially reduces transaction fees for no reason. Transaction fees are already just a few pennies on average, and trust networks can actually offer transaction fees which are orders of magnitude lower than what bitcoin will ever be able to. Essentially I think the need for trustable exchanges is more pressing than the need for lower transaction fees, in the short term.

That chart would make more sense if the y-axis had uniform ticks.
@_date: 2015-06-05 19:37:57
Actually thats not really happening, since blocks aren't being consistently filled yet. But it wouldn't make sense for a miner to not include a transaction with a fee if they could possible include it. With larger blocks, there is less incentive for users to pay fees because it's easier to get the tx into the next block. If we switched to 20MB all the sudden for example, it would be 20x easier to get your tx into the next block and so it seems that the miner fee incentive would immediately drop by a factor of 20. Larger memory and bandwidth requirements, higher orphan rates, less fee incentive, all these things contribute to miner centralization.

@_date: 2015-06-10 10:21:00
Seems to me that miners may actually just not include a lot more than 1MB of transactions into blocks, even if they could. There is actually an incentive to make blocks smaller because they propagate faster, leading to less stales. I'm guessing there will be some natural balance there where miners choose an amount of transactions with fees but also try to make them small enough to propagate fast enough to not go stale, according to some observed probability equation.
@_date: 2015-06-21 04:30:10

That's the entire point of trust networks, to distribute trust. There willl never be trustable exchanges without trust networks, and bitcoin will never go mainstream with trustable exchanges. I disagree that trust networks are unproven technology, they have very clear MVP implementations already, and millions and millions of dollars of startup capital right now.

It would take however long the rest of the network took to find a block with the loss of that hashing power, so say a miner with 30% of the hashing power went down, a single block would take almost 20 minutes expected time, and them the network would go back to 10 minute blocks, as I understand it.

There is *no possible way* to determine the integrity of either the software or the hardware, short of examining every transistor trace in your chip with an electron microscope, and writing all your code from the ground up, in assembly.

 The funny thing is that you can do fractional reserve banking with any commodity including bitcoin, and it's fine as long as the bank isn't gambling on derivatives markets with 30:1 leverage against customer deposits, like they do today.

What if I start a million nodes that will relay any colored-coin tx I tell them to, and one of my altered forged colored-coin tx makes it into a bitcoin block? All the nodes down at NASDAQ will disagree of course and acurately report that these tx are forged and non-valid. But it seems like those nodes are relying only on their internal audit trails and verification rules, not necessarily on anything that the bitcoin blockchain reports.

Gavin's character seems to be the issue at hand. He thinks *he* is the core dev team. He thinks it's appropriate to introduce a branch that would hard-fork the network, against the wishes of the other core devs. He also thinks having private meetings with the CIA is cool. I also agree that bitcoin should be working with other projects that would move transactions off-blockchain, and I see a big blocksize jump as detrimental to that effort.

One easy way to make a cold wallet is to just use vanitygen to generate a simple vanity address, which will then spit out a private key for you. Don't save that key to any file, just write it on a slip of paper and generate a QR code / text copy of the linked public receiving address. Now, you can stick that private key into a physical bitcoin, or just put it in a secure place. Bam, cold wallet address. No dedicated hardware needed. If you ever want to retrieve the coins, you can just import the private key into a wallet like electrum and spend to a new address at that time.

Bitfinex is a tough market to trade robotically because of how they handle fees and pair order.

Then, they have a fee structure that is different for buyers and sellers, differs again by pair, and no way of knowing how much fee you will pay until after the trade is executed.

Is just a word that anarchists use to describe any system of authority, at all. Free markets can only function when the rights of the property-holders are protected. Anarchism doesn't protect property rights, it implements a system that is inimical to property rights. Anarchism is a system where people can hire private armies and take out their personal scores by force, with no recourse for their victims. I don't believe competing court systems are a solution, because there is always a single de facto final authority, any delusions of power-sharing notwithstanding. Anarchists are opposed to any justice system with final authority that they must conform to because they are *moral relativists* who argue that there is no such thing as justice. It's a fantasy though, there will always be a final legal authority over any territory, no matter how many times you split the terrritory. They just want to split authority as many times as possible and have the smallest territories possible or even overlapping justice systems, which are unstable at best and mob warfare at worst. Anarchism is reductionist, we live in an anarchist world and the gangs called USA and China have taken over.

Funny thing about bitcoin regulation is that the more formally they regulate it, the more easily it will be adopted in foreign countries, and the more likely foreign merchants will be to accept it. The more foreign merchants accept it, the less likely I am to have to use any type of fiat currency or exchange bitcoin for fiat in the first place.

There are several very real reasons to be wary of increased block sizes. The main one is scalability, viewed as a storage versus network capacity issue. We can get away with 20MB and not break network scalibility, however this is a trend that shouldn't continue to larger block sizes, because network scalability is a real thing and can't just be ignored, and networks don't have the convenient Moore's Law thing going for them like storage does. The second is that increasing block sizes will change the miner fee reward incentive, making it easier to get your tx into the blocks means that there will be less incentive for people to pay as much of a transaction fee. This makes it more likely that bitcoin will be flooded by more and more systems that make use of tons of microtransactions, instead of encouraging a leaner system where most transactions are done through trusted third-party networks like OT, and only more important backend settlements are done on the blockchain. If we encourage a system that can support tons of tx with little fees, thats what we will get, and I imagine a few years from now, people will just be clamoring for even larger block sizes again. The third one I can mention off the top of my head is the pool decentralization problem. We are already seing a rather quick centralization happening in the miner community, and making blocksizes larger only makes it marginally harder / more expensive to run a node. Until there is some reversal of the trend of pool centralization, increasing blocksizes could be argued to be adding to the centralization problem. Lastly, a hard fork is like the opposite of "smooth" in the bitcoin world. It *will* literally split bitcoin into two networks for some time.

They would be better off using a last-signed-entry system where you just need consensus and not the entire blockchain or even a pruned version on every node. These already have existed for a while in several forms. The benefits of the blockchain come from decentralization and the race to solve the next block, and the value associated with the tokens is linked to the difficulty of that problem. It's a solution to the Byzantine General's problem and it's not really directly applicable to traditional centralized banking or book-keeping challenges. I wish them the best in playing with blockchain tech, though.

Or that's why we need so urgently need exchanges linked to trust networks that can take a bunch of these transactions off-blockchain, to help bitcoin scale and so that average user fees can be reduced. Blocksize should set the transaction rate, not vice-versa, otherwise the blocks can grow without bounds in relation to the communications network speed, which only grows linearly.

It's possible to use cryptocurrencies anonymously, and it's getting easier over time. The idea that there will eventually be "white" and "black" coins and all "unregistered" transactions may eventually be made illegal is not new, but it turns out to be extremely difficult to implement in practise. Smart property could similarly, have anonymous owners, theoretically, but then it comes down to a matter of enforcement of property ownership. Escrow or holding companies, for example, could legally enforce ownership on behalf of anonymous owners of property. That seems like a problem tied more directly to real property ownership than to cryptocurrencies, specifically.

Ok, but the way that the NASDAQ's Open Access colored-coin implementation works, the bitcoin nodes do not in any way verify the validity of the "colored coin" transactions. They are not unique to which bitcoin addresses can store or transmit them in any way, so imho, calling it a "colored coin" implementation at all is sort of stretching the definition. You would need a custom client to verify the transactions embedded into the bitcoin blockchain, and that custom client itself has no proof of work or even any signatures tied to the colored coin tx. It's like they are running a standard traditional trust network, just using bitcoin OP_RETURN codes as the transport layer for the tx messages, and bitcoin OP_RETURN is a pretty terrible communications transport layer in terms of bandwidth and usage costs. Honestly, they'd do better to just use Ripple, Open Transactions, Ethereum... some tool that was made for what they are trying to do. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 19:19:55
I'm sorry but I still fail to see how the OP_RETURN tx are verified by the bitcoin network here. The bitcoin nodes only validate bitcoin transactions according to the bitcoin ledger history, and the proof of work is used to determine which pending transactions make it into the final ledger and who gets the mining reward. How exactly are the colored-coin transactions verified? Are you suggesting that mining pools switch to your modified client?

I don't buy that argument. I don't think designing the network to always avoid overflow is a realistic goal, or a desireable one at all. I foresee a future where most users use third-party trust networks like Open Transactions, and very few, advanced users make more expensive blockchain transactions only for more important back-end settlements. This is actually better for the users, because third-party trust networks are far superior for microtransactions in terms of fees, and faster even than good 0-confirm systems, because microtransactions are always low/medium priority on the blockchain. In this future, end-users would never have to deal with bitcoin miner fees or tx delays, at all.

I have done some analysis of the "Open Access" colored-coin implementation, and I have come to the conclusion that is is essentially *not* backed by the blockchain or secured by the hashing power of the bitcoin miners. It's just another standard trust network, which suffers all the same vulnerabilities of a traditional trust network, like vulnerability to Sybil attacks. It happens to store it's transactions in the OP_RETURN codes of bitcoin transactions, but beyond that, there is almost no link between Open Access and bitcoin. They are not really *using* the blockchain, they are merely bloating it. There is no reason why Open Access transactions need to be on the blockchain, and the blockchain and bitcoin miners do not in any way secure Open Access transactions.

You are right that the ultimate factor is the IO performance of the nodes, and this is directly correlated to and capped by the network speed, which is known to grow linearly over time. I don't agree that the blocks should dynamically scale over short time periods to handle spikes, that is *specifically* the function of the incentive fee market and this change would completely eliminate that. If the blocks can dynamically scale, then they can dynamically scale to any size, and you have thrown out the network speed constraint also. It's untenable.

@_date: 2015-05-09 03:24:29
Ok I've given this some more critical thought. Scaling the tx fee by a percentage of the tx amount is not sustainable over time because the of the deflationary nature of the asset and the expect value growth. I predict that will lead to overly-high tx fees over time, and it will discourage third-party trust networks built on top of the blockchain that could greatly reduce end-user fees, or at least delay that growth transition phase. Ideally, the blocksize will grow as a ratio of the storage capacity expected growth rate over the communications network expected growth rate, such that it always maintains a static burden on storage capacity and network constraints, because it is known to be stable at the current ratio. Thus, the blocksize should grow as O(t) where expected growth of the storage capacity is O(t^2 ) and expected growth of the communications network is O(t). This mathematical relationship "sets" a natural market incentive, which is actually really interesting and requires further thought.
@_date: 2015-05-27 17:36:24


Sadly, no, that's not true. Since both sides of the fork are both running the exact same rules (except for the blocksize limit), transactions from either fork can *randomly* make it into the blockchain on the other fork also. This isn't just a hard fork, it's gonna spaghettify the transaction ledger if it goes wrong.

You can create asset contracts without using OP_RETURN as a communications transport mechanism, and I see little compelling reason to do that other than "woo fancy, it's on the blockchain". There is no proof-of-work involved with creating asset contracts or transactions in the Open Assets colored coin implementation, it's all just a consensus among custom clients about which OP_RETURN data they chose to consider valid. This is not just "metadata", it's account balances. 


Not true at all. A lot of people invest in systems that compete with or run on top of bitcoin without using unsigned OP_RETURN data as their "metadata". This is just bad implementation of something that other trust networks already do just fine. Factom uses OP_RETURN in an actually unique and interesting way, this colored coin shit is like someone writing a version of Ripple that sends it's communications through OP_RETURN, and then claiming it's "secured by the blockchain". It's not.

I don't think the block size is necessarily relevant to the total amount of miner fees that will be paid. There will be competition with higher tx fees for smaller block sizes, proportionally. I'm not necessarilly opposed to 20MB block sizes, but I do think it's a somewhat crude and temporary solution to more fundamental underlying issues with scalability, and it shouldn't be the goto band-aid fix or we *will* run into issues with network scalability eventually. I think that with systems like OT, it's very possible to run the entire bitcoin network on 1MB blocks, and that actual blockchain transactions could eventually be rather expensive and only used for larger settlements, while microtransactions through trusted third-party networks could be much cheaper than if they were performed on the blockchain. I see that as a more desireable implementation because it reduces average end-user fees, and I happen to be preparing a PR for the OT voting pools implementation this month.


This is not just a regular hard-fork though. This is a *really* hard fork. In a normal hard fork, transactions will either occur on one chain or the other. In this special case, transactions could occur on *both* chains, or just one or the other semi-randomly. This will lead to more confusion and accidental losses than a normal hard fork, so it should be undertaken only when the need is demonstrated absolutely, and probably only once in the lifetime of bitcoin if possible.

Meh, I'm not really convinced. Wouldn't increasing the block size reduce the incentive for people to pay the transaction fee? Why won't we just run into the exact same issue in two years, when people start embedding tons of data in their transactions, because hey, why not? I don't think 20MB blocks are terrible, I just think that it's a delicate balance between storage scalability and network scalability here, and we shouldn't just be continually marching towards larger blocks, and assuming the network speeds will be there to make it feasible.

Eh, your money is just a number in a balance-sheet on their books, until you withdraw the bitcoins back out. You're trading on their internal orderbook with tokens for bitcoin, basically. If they fixed it in a timely manner and didn't give you any hassle, it's not terribly worrisome to me. I'd be much more worried about them actually manipulating the internal orderbook price to influence the outcome of highly-leveraged futures positions, as offshore bucket-houses are known to sometimes do.

I oppose a hardfork to go to 20MB because I see it as a temporary and not-well-thought-out solution. It will just encourage bloat, and then a few years from now everyone will be clamoring for 100MB blocks. I might support some system of slowly, and *linearly*, increasing blocksizes, however I don't agree with the supposition that bitcoin blocks should always be large enough to avoid overflow, because that completely removes any market incentive for transaction fees.

I understand them just fine. I don't think you do.


With a client that follows the same rules as the fork that NASDAQ is running, and verifies the entire bitcoin blockchain and all transactions on it. Even then, you would need to screen out any known (and unknown) malicious nodes telling you that there is a consensus on a transaction when in fact there is not. This is just a newfangled implementation of a traditional trust network, being bloated along into the bitcoin blockchain. It is not in any way secured by the bitcoin blockchain or the bitcoin miners.
@_date: 2015-05-29 00:10:08
Bitcoin nodes don't validate any transactions embedded in the OP_RETURN data, though, so you need a custom client which validates those transactions, right? Like I said before, it would be trivial to get fraudulent colored-coin transactions into the blockchain, and then it comes down to which client or consensus among clients is the validating authority, just like a traditional trust network.

"dynamic blocksize limit" essentially means "no limit". If it were a *linear* increase in blocksize over time, I would likely support that, though. I don't agree with the premise that blocks should always be large enough so that the network never has to handle overflow. I think the network should be robust enough to handle overflow via the miner fee incentive. I also think the pace of transactions should be set by the blocksize, not vice-versa, to make sure that blocks are not scaling faster than the network communication speed, which scales linearly. I also think that most bitcoin transactions should be done over third-party trust networks, as that will greatly reduce the average fees that end-users see, reduce average transaction times, and make exchanges much more trustable.
@_date: 2015-05-28 18:06:49
Treating the new fork as a different coin just doesn't seem like it would work to me, though. Since both forks are running identical code besides the little bit about blocksize, transactions from the "old" bitcoin could still make it into the new blockchain, and vice-versa.

How? The OP_RETURN codes are not cryptographically signed using a private key that only the owner of the shares would possess, as I understand this protocol. What *exactly* is the consensus protocol as to whether the messages are valid transactions or not? What prevents me from generating valid bitcoin transactions that contain invalid OP_RETURN asset transactions and having them be verified? Who does the verification of the asset issuance and transaction records? It's not part of the bitcoin core protocol, so the nodes are not doing that currently. Maybe I'm missing some piece of this that you can elucidate :)

That doesn't really make sense. If it makes it into a *block*, then it will make it into the *blockchain*, and nodes do not have a choice over which blocks are in the blockchain.

There is no such thing as "market anarchy". Anarchism is in no way compatible with capitalism. There can never be a market for force because force distorts markets. You are mistaking the use of force for a product produced by the use of the mind and brought to market where it can be sold voluntarily, but force is no such thing. A market for force is called a "war".  You say "private competing police force" and what I hear is "private army of thugs".  You don't protect the NAP by allowing anyone to hire a private army and take justice into their own hands. There will never be a transition to anarchy, that would be nothing but a descent into chaos.

I recently got a Trezor and I have to agree, it lacks some basic functionality that I would expect from a device designed as a cold-wallet storage device.
1. You have to plug it into a machine, which is connected to the internet, to use it. It only works through mytrezor.com, via a special plugin that has to be installed. That is not a very "cold" wallet, imho. Why can't I use it with an *offline* computer? Why can't it sign transactions offline?
2. They push firmware "upgrades". Well, the firmware is the piece I'm most suspicious of. Going to a website online and reprogramming the firmware is a *major, major, major* security breach, imho.
3. Why would I use this, when I have to carry around a laptop to use it? I could just put electrum on an encrypted drive and be just as secure, it seems.

Yes, ok, I understand that now, thank you. So the only thing that verifies the transactions is the internal rules of the colored-coin client. It is not "verified" by the blockchain, only *recorded* there. There may be lots of fraudulent colored-coin data on the blockchain and bitcoin nodes don't know or care, they don't participate in the validation of any colored-coin transactions. So my question at that point becomes, why is this better than a traditional trust network that doesn't use OP_RETURN codes as the communications transport layer? OP_RETURN is arguably *terrible* as a communications layer in terms of bandwidth and latency. 
Now what happens if the owners of NASDAQ decide they want to lock certain accounts or forbid transactions to certain addresses? They could release a new version of the client with these new rules, right? Is the network then "forked"?

I think your confusion comes from not understanding big O notation. The constants are not actually important at all, it's only the order that matters. Using this theory, you could extrapolate that the blocksize can grow linearly over time at a rate constant not higher than that of the observed network communications growth rate, to maintain a static burden under the network constraint, which makes perfect sense. So, instead of hardforking and just doing one big jump, a better plan would be to allow the blocks to grow algorithmically, linearly with time. "Dynamic" block sizing still basically just means "no blocksize limit", which *completely* ignores the network constraint and does away with any market mechanism for transaction fee, so I wouldn't support that at all, I would just refuse to use the new fork and only accept coins from the old one. I might buy some Monero, though, just to speculate :)

Someone built an implementation called *Assembly*, in Python? This is the type of thing that just makes me grit my teeth. Wow, the whole thing works in only 300 lines of code? Hmmm, now I have to review the code and figure out how it works. Hmmmmmmmmmmmm, from [here](


It's impossible to verify that the private key has been deleted though.
As I understand this, it requires a new custom bitcoin client which will verify the audit trail of the assets being issued and transferred via these OP_RETURN codes. I wonder how robust that implementation might be against a Sybil attack. It almost seems like they are building a layer on top of bitcoin that bypasses the whole "proof of work" and "signed messages" pieces, and thus suffers all the vulnerabilities of a traditional trust network.

It is pessimistic to view men as ignorant barabarians who can never have a functioning government based on the consent of the governed. It is a moral escapist attitude to say there is no such thing as justice and all laws are corrupt. It is reductionist to be anti-authoritarian, because there is always a *de-facto* final legal authority over any territory, and that final legal authority is always decided by force in the real world. To suggest that multiple competing police and justice systems overlap in jurisdiction is naive, and would only lead to instability, power-struggles via force, and mob-warfare in practise.

In this schema, exchanges would actually be insulated from government rules to some extent, because they would not directly handle fiat transactions in either direction. Those would be handled by payment processors and banks, who are better equipped to deal with local financial regulations. Localities that implement stricter currency control mechanisms for their fiat reserve systems would create incentive for black markets and a "dual pricing" mechanism through official and non-official channels, just as we see with USD/Peso rates in South American countries.

You are right about nothing having intrinsic value, but not about value being subjective.

Yes, but bitcoin network in no way validates these transactions! The colored-coin network is still only as strong as the consensus of the custom clients, and there is no proof-of-work or cryptographic signature involved. It would be trivial to game this system to create false colored-coin transactions and get them into the bitcoin blockchain. The only defense would be that the computer systems running the internal NASDAQ fork would disagree about the validity of those transactions. So any trustably vendor network would have to connect to only *their* machines. Sounds real decentralized, right?

I agree that making no changes in a software package until you have fully thought them out and analyzed all possibly implications is a recipe for code paralysis. I still, however, don't agree with the idea of hardforking to do a single static blocksize adjustment to 20MB. I see it as a temporary solution, with the implication that the network should never have to handle overflow via a miner fee incentive market, and that we should just do a hard-fork whenever blocks start to get too big.

I see the 20MB increase as a temporary solution, and as such, not very well thought out. The implications are that the network should never have to handle overflow via the miner fee incentive market, and that we should just hard-fork again later when we reach 20MB blocksize. I think the network should be robust enough to handle overflow via the miner fee incentives, and I think the recent transaction volume "tests" proved that it is already robust enough to handle overflow gracefully. I think hard-forks should solve the specific problem that they address with some finality, not just kick the can down the road until it's exponentially harder to solve. I also think that eventually, most transactions *should* be moved off-blockchain to third-party trust networks such as exchanges linked to something like an Open-Transactions "voting pool". I see this as a far more desireable path for bitcoin in terms of both hardware and network scalability, and better for the users because it will allow actually *trustable* exchanges and greatly lower average transaction fees and processing time.

Shouldn't the network be robust enough to handle overflow and the miner fee incentive kick in for tx prioritization? Is designing the network to always avoid overflow a realistic goal in the long-term? As you say, an attacker could flood the blockchain with tx, but wouldn't they also have to spend a lot of money to keep their tx fee high enough to get into blocks? The change to 20MB mitigates the problem by making it 20x more expensive to pull off then, right? It also has the effect of reducing the normal miner fee incentive by a factor of 20 though, if I understand correctly, so it sort of encourages blockchain bloat.

I doubt that transaction fees on blocks will go up because of this. It will almost definitely go down dramatically. You want to use your pool to exclude tx because they don't have high enough fees? Go right ahead, just means less money for your pool.

The mining pools have a choice over which transactions to include in new blocks, and these will be the ones prioritized by transaction fee and bitcoin days burned by a given tx, as I understand it. They would have no way of knowing which pending transactions were being relayed by nodes accepting one size of blockchain limit or another, and transactions would thus get accepted into one or both blockchain forks based on fee and days burned, somewhat randomly. This is why this is not a "simple" hard fork, because people on the smaller chain have incentive to make transactions which are included in the "bigger block" chain and not in the "smaller block" chain, to attempt double-spends and splitting the coins into different addresses on different chains.

Front-running in a traditional sense is really only possible on markets that offer immediate-fill-or-kill orders and high-speed reporting, as in 1ms or less for orders to be placed and then reported filled or not filled. This is a fundamentally different thing. This is about markets competing to guarantee the best price against their competitors to try to swing volume from big market makers. This actually makes the market more efficient because it increases incentive for the exchanges to be more actively involved in arbitraging rates against each other.

Hacked router might not be able to penetrate your server but it can surely listen pretty good.

This doesn't seem like a well-thought out trading strategy. Lets say the price goes down $12, and you buy 6bitcoins. Now it goes back up $12. You sell 1.5 btc four times? But if it only goes down $10 and back up $10, you bought 5 bitcoin, sold 4.5, and still hold 0.5 bitcoin. That seems unbalanced.

True enough, the USD and fiat central bank financing are unique, and do not fit under the classical definition of a Ponzi scheme. However, one of the most essential characteristics of a Ponzi is that new victims are required to keep the system solvent, and that is very clearly true with USD right now. USD is floating right now on artificially inflated housing prices, caused by artificially low overnight intra-bank lending interest rates. This is essentially pushing debt onto the next generation of Americans for short-term options gains for bankers. Another large aspect of the American economy that shouldn't be ignored is Social Security, and this is more truly a classical "Ponzi scheme", that accounts for like 20% of our GDP.

1: No. Even though the penny stock price may move more in percentage, the mcap of a high-volume stock will have much greater valuation swings based on the price changes, so it's sort of apples and oranges there.
2: bitcoin's rise from 0.5 cents to $300 doesn't mark volatility. Volatility is not measured that way. It's measured by the movement of price and mcap in an time-averaged period. If you want to show volatility based on inception point versus current value, you'd have to consider that while bitcoin is up hundreds of thousands of percent, USD is down 98%, in which case bitcoin looks like a very clear winner.
@_date: 2015-03-05 17:27:25
Sorry but you just don't understand how currency markets work if you think those coins sold below market value. Go try and make a dark pool bid below market value and you will be laughed at. You know what, get me a fair market value quote for 50k bitcoins right now, it's not at the market value right now, is it? The price you get is well above the market rate because you are 50k coins into the sell depth, plus when you actually try to execute that order on a public exchange everyone else will start front-running you and the true price you pay will be much higher than their orderbook shows, if it even goes up to depth.

That's a nice little explanation of why banks hold dollars, but it's very simplistic. The real motivation for banks to hold dollars right now is that they pay 0% on the dollars borrowed from other banks or the FED, yet they can charge consumers 3-5% on interest-bearing accounts with that same loaned money, and they only have to hold 10% reserves on it, even. Right now they are also holding USD because credit lending requirements are in a squeeze right now and a whole generation of people either went underwater on previous mortgages or owes the equivalent of a mortgage to the US Gov't already in the form of college loans.


You might want to re-examine this statement. USD are literally debt-notes, printed by the Federal Reserve and exchanged for treasury bonds, and the Federal Reserve charges *interest* on that debt. In fact the amount of the debt is by definition larger than the amount of all dollars, and grows exponentially. If that's not a scam, I don't know what is.

There are definitely some opportunities for small banks to integrate bitcoin right now, both to provide new customer services, and as an investment vehicle. Bitcoin remittance had a good year and is definitely a feasible way to shave percentage points off international funds transfers, and secure / insured funds storage is something I think a lot of "newbie"/non-technical bitcoiners might be interested in. Tell him to look at the new ETFs on the investment side, but the all depends on his risk profile.

No, it's not even a good one. Hedges are bets that are *known* to move in the opposite direction of a target fund, reliably, on a day-to-day basis. They have negative correlation scores, and it's rare and valuable to find a high negative correlation score. The only reliable ones are historically tied to large industries, or the direct options market.

I actually know a little about computer security ;) Let's take a look at this.


While it is plausible that a default configuration may allow a server to display a page containing information about itself, such as OS version, webserver version, and package data, this post actually does not mention a *captcha* at all, which is how the Feds claim to have gotten the IP. Also, a webserver does not know it's outside IP address by default, in fact discovering your own outside IP address is something you would have to specifically enable via a scripted call to a third-party IP echo service, which is something that there is *no doubt* was not enabled on the Silk Road server. So, the idea that the server may have spit out some info about itself is plausible, but it absolutely would not have included the true IP of the server that the webhost was on, as seen by the outside, non-tor network. So, basically, this is not very strong evidence, at all. Really without forensic data, it's just hearsay of a highly implausible scenario. The feds didn't really want to give up much forensic data on this investigation, for some odd reason.
@_date: 2015-03-30 23:49:33
Sounds like something that should be examined as evidence by a jury, to me. I'd like to hear the feds explain a lot about their forensic evidence against Ullbricht, I'd find that highly amusing.

That's not true at all. What they did seriously limits the governments ability to continue their illegal wiretapping of foreign heads-of-state and American citizens going forward into the future. Why do you think there is such a panic about strong encryption on things like iPhones right now? It also influences large tech companies to put their headquarters and sensitive tech locations in foreign countries, leading to less business tax revenue for the US government, less cooperation with leading technology industry execs, and a harder time for them to stay technologically relevant and on top of the industries they would monitor. After Snowden's revelation that the CIA spied on German Chancellor Angela Merkel, she accused Obama of using Stazi tactics, and it greatly reduced his influence and intelligence sharing there.

No, sorry. I have been sysadmin for many, many sites, including those with classified data. No webserver knows it's outside IP unless you specifically try to make it know that data, and it's not a default installed package in any hosting software because it requires a third-party echo service. Even IF the admin had gone to the trouble to setup a tool that had no purpose other than the *de-anonymize themselves*, it *still* would only have served the TOR IP. It would have taken special doing to run the script through a non-tor connection, get the true outside IP, and then tell that data to the TOR webhost. It's beyond implausible, there's just *no way in hell* that the tor webhost would have been serving it's true non-tor server IP to visitors. Not through a captcha, not through a default admin page.
What happened is that the NSA used a network attack against the TOR network, while doing massive network analysis using many tor nodes, to de-anonymize the webhost. Either that, or they actually control some of the key tor routing nodes, which would know the true IP of some tor servers. Either way, they are being very tight-lipped about the whole thing. No forensic data. They really didn't have a strong technical case against Ullbricht, which is the most amazing part of this trial.

Even if miners decided to do that, they don't control most of the nodes on the network. It would be disadvantageous to those who hold bitcoin, so most nodes would not switch to the new ruleset and any blocks mined on the new ruleset would go orphaned.

Essentially their little hardfork would fail and they would give up any profits they would have made during the time they spent mining this new fork.

If a single group ever gets to 95% of the network, bitcoin price will have already crashed to almost nothing, because they will have the ability to do 51% attacks whenever they want. More likely is that once this group approaches 51% and keeps going, most people in the network will just start blackballing their IP address, effectively kicking them off the network.

No. I'll never use it. I would recommend for others not to. There are much more secure ways of using bitcoin, this is an unnecessary risk.

Yeah, but they have my IRL info and they report to the US feds, so I'll probably never trade there.

Just no. This concept is obviously over your head. Venture capital lending is not long-term. You would have to be a straight fool to take a mortgage loan in bitcoin. You apparently missed the part of the discussion where I pointed out that the average rate on 10-yr loans is 2%, not anywhere near 10%. Maybe in your fantasy world bitcoin will make a great lending tool, but in the real world it will never happen.

Blockchain.info has come under scrutiny over lax security methods this year, including placing the *private keys* into browser cache, and using weak encryption. Never give your private keys to a third-party, as a rule.

Yeah but it sends your private keys to Amazon by default.

Change in buying power of your holdings. With a penny stock, even though the price may shoot up, any significant holdings of that stock won't rise in value particularly, because the market is shallow and trying to sell into it would depress the price much more easily than with a high-volume stock. Plus, by definition you can't hold nearly as much of a penny stock or it wouldn't be a penny stock anymore, so the net change in buying power floating on a penny stock is much less. With a high-volume stock, even a small change and holdings will fully realize the change in value based on that stock movement.
You are still making the mistake of picking endpoints as your durations in markets with vastly differing timescales. If you want to measure relative volatility in these markets, you would time-average volatility across time-periods that are relative to the total duration of the currency's existence.

You can generally determine the relative value of an altcoin by how active their dev team is. No commits for 9 months? How is this thing getting pumped so hard?

Yeah I think he should give a special gift to the Prince, because the Prince is a much more powerful prospective ally in the political realm, and also the sponsor of the prize.

Actually it makes a huge difference. The difference between the real world and your fantasy world in which bitcoin lending makes sense.
If a loan is not beneificial for both borrower and lending, then no loan will take place. This doesn't take a genius to figure out. There is absolutely no circumstance where a long-term loan denominated in bitcoin will make sense. It will never happen.

I've heard from several people within the last week that they are having hardware issues with the Trezor. Turns on and says they have 0 balance, and "restore from seed" is not helping. I've also seen those threads get downvoted and no response from Trezor. I'm starting to think I should just move all my coins off there and try again with ledger instead.

"sufficiently" is a subjective term, and depends on the usage. Is any hardware or software 100% trustable? No, never can be unless you built it from sand and programmed the boatloader and compilers from scratch, with no outside help. Is my offline linux machine more secure than my cellphone? Absolutely, 100%.

Sure if you can get someone to take a loan with you for 10% apr, I'm sure that would be great, as a lender. However, in the real world in which we live, only loan-sharks at payday loan places get rates like that, and they are short-term loans. Long term loans have interest rates at around 2% or less. Lets talk about the actual real world here, not your unrealistic fantasy world, ok? 


That makes absolutely no sense, at all. You are just talking out your ass.

It looks like activity that could only have been executed by someone with admin access to the Gox computer system. The non-standard trade entries and trades during downtime are clear indications of orders coming from within the network, not an outside trade occuring. Hard to tell if it was really an inside job, or if their system was just pwned, though.

ACH transactions can be reversed for up to 6 months, for a variety of reasons, while bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed. The problem is that nobody can trust payments made using the legacy financial system, in exchange for their bitcoins, and those transactions take up to 72 hours sometimes, while bitcoin transactions usually take less than 10 minutes. Vendors who process those transactions are heavily monitored and regulated by the state, not only for AML / KYC and fraud / chargeback protection, but also as a means of capital control by a central bank trying to protect the dollar. But seriously try localbitcoins.com, just meet up with a local geek and use cash. I have met cool people that way.

There is no such thing as intrinsic value. What you are describing seems to be relative valuation. If you think you can predict the markets, please try.
