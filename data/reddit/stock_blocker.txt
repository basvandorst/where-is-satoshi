cool, thanks for the criticism. the link is a wiki so feel free to submit edits.
for what it's worth, i'm not sold on one solution vs another. Open Transactions simply seems the most developed and featureful, not necessarily the best. I just think we need a working API for cryptographically secure asset issuing/trading which can occur independently of trust in the server.
Currently there's effectively nowhere for masses of people to invest their bitcoins in such assets, nor is there anywhere for business owners to issue assets.

Except that most GLBSE assets didn't pack up and leave, they stayed and continued to pay dividends because that is how legitimate businesses know they can secure further capital -- by paying dividends on time, and by avoiding excessive stock devaluations. 
Sure, asset issuers could run with the money. Some have seemingly done this, i.e. pirateat40. That will always be a concern when you lend someone your money. 
The problem with GLBSE though was that it monopolized all the information tying asset issuers to asset holders. This is what we need something like Open Transactions to solve: to allow us to issue assets, then redeem them independently from the server where they were issued.
This would allow us to maintain relationships with our asset issuers, but also -- key!! -- continue to trade our assets on another server should the asset issuer choose to honor them there. 
Unlike GLBSE, OT would let asset holders easily prove their ownership -- even if the server went down. Then the asset holder could choose to honor the asset on a new server.
Notice the common theme here? We have to trust asset issuers -- we should not have to trust the exchanges and servers which host our trades. OT is one attempt to make this possible. 
But we still need a good GUI implementation!
@_date: 2012-11-15 00:26:13
While I'd love to see that bounty get paid out for some awesome work, I really posted this to help stir up discussion about moving forward in the wake of the GLBSE collapse.
We're all basically on the same page that something like Open Transactions, or "colored coins" implementations like pyBond, will be the best way to allow for decentralized asset issuing and exchange.
So what we need now is a set of implementations. We need clients we can run locally, but we also need the next round of GLBSEs: the "central" stock exchange web frontends, which can now be backed by something like OT.
There's a lot of money sitting idle right now, if the prior figures on GLBSE were anything to be compared. No doubt bounties will be paid out for successful development of such projects but also imagine the direct reward in being able to issue assets anonymously...

are you sure hashrate would be low? there *would* be spam, after all.... it would just decrease in volume as legitimate uses outpaced it and increased its cost. and the per-message cost could be low, guaranteeing that spam essentially subsidizes the security of the blockchain from nefarious double-senders.
anyway, with cryptographic signatures on all messages, verifying their integrity is extremely easy.
@_date: 2012-11-29 16:32:41

@_date: 2012-11-30 17:49:29
Due to hyperinflation the Iranian government mandates an impossible exchange rate between the Rial and the USD. Since the exchange rate is artificially enforced by the government, the effect is that all exchange goes underground at the normal market rates.
Both USD and Bitcoins are holding their value more stably than the Iranian Rial and are therefore far less likely to become worthless when the Rial inevitably crashes further. So they are both attractive for Iranians to hold because their savings are all about to go caput otherwise.

The wiki page should help clarify: 
Basically, you could issue an asset (stock/currency/bond/contract) on a server, where it would be traded for other assets. The ownership of the assets is cryptographically provable by their holders -- even if the server goes down.
So an honest asset issuer, in the face of an exchange like GLBSE collapsing, could simply invite their investors/owners to move to another exchange and honor their existing shares under a new asset there.
@_date: 2012-11-28 02:54:29

If some Farsi speakers want to translate bitcoin-qt into Farsi, there is nothing jgarzik can do to stop them. A kick-ban will not prevent them from doing this. Nor will it protect jgarzik, who is uninvolved in such a translation project.

The prohibition approach has been shown to be a miserable failure by the currency blackmarkets resulting from capital controls in Argentina and Iran, and by the drug war, among other things. 
It would be trivial to ban bitcoins or certain uses of them. It would be non-trivial (read: impossible) to shut down a thriving Bitcoin economy through simple prohibition -- even if you managed to get it banned in every country around the world, simultaneously.
By the time they ban bitcoins, we won't even be using fiat.

As I understand it, Open Transactions operates independently from Bitcoin.
I could be wrong about some of this but here's my mental sketch of how OT works:
Users connect to a server which processes each transaction sequentially in a kind of checkbook. Each transaction is triple signed (server, sender, recipient). A transaction id is signed out to a sender, who is then the only person authorized to sign that "check". They sign it and then the recipient signs to confirm receipt. 
As far as Bitcoin goes, an asset issuer could use the OT and Bitcoin APIs to automatically back their asset with redeemable Bitcoins-on-demand. That would be one way you could easily trade Bitcoins on OT though it would involve trust in the Bitcoin-backed security. 
I'm not sure if there is a simpler/better integration than that or not.
@_date: 2012-11-30 21:04:49
It's not illegal to promote Bitcoin to Iranians. It is illegal to engage in trade with Iran - not with people elsewhere who speak Farsi.

Global remittances are a fairly massive and continuous (sustainable) factor in the GDPs of dozens or hundreds of countries. For example: "for every $2 billion in remittances that entered Mexico, production in the economy increased by over a $6.5 billion." -- 
I think the point is that once remittances enter the local economy, they are primarily spent and reinvested locally. So their direct impact is to spur other areas of economic growth.
With Bitcoin, in contexts of collapsing local fiat currencies, this would mean providing a source of bitcoins for local businesses to use in investment and trade. So it seems remittances are simply vital to bitcoin's further adoption in places affected by hyperinflation like Iran and Argentina.
As for your question -- other ways of obtaining bitcoins -- the remittances also form the basis for a local exchange of bitcoins for other currencies/goods simply by making them available, where otherwise buying for local fiat would be impossible.
@_date: 2012-12-20 23:57:55

User deposits Bitcoins to fund their Steam account. BitPay processes the deposit and sends USD to Steam. Steam maintains the user's account balance in USD. When the user wants to withdraw Bitcoins, BitPay accepts Steam's USD and converts it to Bitcoins are the current exchange rate.
Prices could be entirely pegged to USD. Bitcoin is just a cheaper, more convenient payment method for USD payments in this case.
Given that it's been tried and true for years now, there's no logical reason left now not to at least accept Bitcoin simply as a USD payment system.

As a music-lover, and a fan of CoinDL -- in fact, the one who recommended OP accept bitcoins :) -- I gotta say there are two main factors that hold me back from using CoinDL more often for music. 
 - I always want FLAC. I want to know that what I'm getting is lossless and DRM-free. More info up front about the format and quality would be awesome. Multiple choices for format would be even better.
 - Full content previews. On Bandcamp I can stream whole albums before I buy them. On CoinDL I get a short, nice preview, which is helpful, but far less likely to convince me to buy.
As it is Bandcamp meets my needs far better and I can simply donate BTC to any artists I like, who are willing to accept it. But it would be awesome if CoinDL could close the gap, because nothing is better suited to this kind of transaction than Bitcoin.
edit: sorry if this sounds hard on CoinDL. I really love it and know it will succeed :)

I don't think national intranet is a serious concern. People already use wifi/cellular tech to get around censorship in border regions. There's no reason those connections cannot be routable from other networks further inside the country too.
In short, the blockchain will most certainly continue to be proliferated, and probably much more easily than anyone has been able to guess so far (so far, we haven't had any major tests of this).

The same number of blocks will be solved before the fixed point of the halving, regardless of the time spent on each block.

My rebuttal is, in short, that falling prices are a natural outcome of technological development. If deflation is a serious concern with gold, it is primarily because you can only chop gold down so far. That is not the case with bitcoin, so I see no reason prices can't simply fall to match production costs.
That said, trying to come up with new approaches for managing the money supply is not without its merits. I just think that it would be difficult to find a better way than a deterministic protocol.

It's not really fair to say on the one hand that bitcoin will never reach beyond a black market niche, and on the other hand discount all of its numerous non-blackmarket uses as "specialized cases" (and at least according to some studies, non black market use is overwhelmingly dominant compared to black market use, something like 4:1 IIRC)

The weed plants outside around these parts would beg to differ with you, friend. I know you aren't going to get a large yield, or a quality crop out of a wild plant. But it most certainly does grow wild. 
You missed my main point, too, which is that the labor involved in tending a few plants doesn't amount to anything like $100/oz. Only making weed illegal can raise its price to those astronomical levels. Much like would happen if bitcoin was banned.

I didn't know that about the treasurers/accountants. It makes sense. There were many of us who were highly critical of putting our vital infrastructure / revenue flow into the hands of specialists. Unfortunately not enough of us were critical early on of putting it into the hands of the GA at all.
The working-group model seemed to be highly effective though, at least until its formalized bureaucratization into the "spokes group" crap. 
This is to say, a better model than the OWS GA is to simply fund those working-groups whose aims and/or organizational forms we directly support, and withhold funding those groups we do not.
The working groups were able to formulate coherent, (more) consistent aims than the GA. The GA had a good organizational model, but at a scale which prevented it from being anything more than group therapy (which is valuable in some ways). We never should have allowed it to receive the incoming donations directly. From the very beginning, people should never have been allowed to build up "OWS" as an organization. But we did not see the bureaucrats within ourselves in time to stop it.
As for keeping government out of corporations, I believe most of the people I met through OWS simply didn't care what the government does, because it is not a relevant question. We have no say in what government does, it is our enemy, therefore we should take no moral position on its actions. Most of OWS simply opposed its existence.

I totally disagree that holding savings ("hoarding") in bitcoins is somehow bad for the economy. When you buy and hold, you help appreciate the value of everyone else's bitcoins relatively. That's good!
However, your question is great. Spending your bitcoins *is* better. So is selling things to obtain bitcoins.
I'd recommend you check out bitmit.net -- and consider selling items on there, instead of simply buying bitcoins. You should also see bitcoinstore.com for one of the best retail sites to spend your coins on.
Basically, buying/selling items for bitcoins helps contribute to its use as a real currency (not just a speculation). Saving bitcoins helps (in a small way) to increase everyone else's spending power.

All it would take is one gun dealer in the US to accept bitcoin via BitPay, Coinbase, etc., and they can then legally ship the guns to any licensed dealer near their customers. So the customers would pay in BTC and pick up the guns locally, but the local gun shop wouldn't have to understand BTC.
Once one company starts shipping guns for BTC, I bet the local gun shops where the guns are delivered would start to seriously think about it.
For what it's worth, you can already buy ammunition on Bitmit.net. It's actually easier/cheaper to buy ammo there than it is in brick-and-mortar gun shops in many places (what with the current shortage)

good points, and thanks for clarification.
I'd just point out that you mean we have under QE a negligible *price* inflation
to me, monetary inflation is more important, because we constitute the demand for the currency which results in lower prices relative to the price of the currency. as our demand evaporates (whether shifting to other currencies, or to gold, or to... bitcoin!) the price of the dollar will fall and therefore all the prices of goods priced in dollars will increase.
so monetary inflation is the important factor, because keeping our demand for dollars artificially high cannot change the dollar's fundamentally un-scarce nature.

For a short period of time, ASICs will increase the amount of blocks confirmed, thereby increasing the amount of coins produced. The difficulty will readjust soon after, though, bringing this back to a normal level by reducing the block confirmation rate to roughly what it was before ASICs.
It would be a huge leap, though, to assume ASIC miners will sell their coins more readily than other miners have been doing in the past.
Personally, I wouldn't bet on any major price effects from ASICs. Maybe if anything there will be a gradual increase, as people begin to realize that their logic was flawed in assuming the price would drop.

ASICMINER dividends also include revenues from selling hardware to miners. More people mining = more profits from sales. And considering that all of the initial R&amp;D is already paid up, ASICs are an extremely high margin commodity.
The miner sales have barely even begun.
So look at it like this. A $20,000 investment into ASICMINER a few months ago could have turned you into a millionaire today if you sold at the right times. Think about what is happening with the ASICMINER revenues at the moment. It is entirely possible that another round of millionaires will be created soon.

fair assessment. it's worth pointing out that the spike was indeed mtgox-localized. 
from what i understand it was something like this: an account was compromised, a huge buy order was filled on the compromised account, a few bitcoins were withdrawn (mtgox limited the losses to a small amount), and then the bitcoins were dumped to the market causing a collapse.
essentially most of the bubble/burst was "false" considered in this light, though it did have some limited effects on the market (but mostly on mtgox)

No, coin value does not directly incentivize merchants to accept BTC. A tendency of coin value to increase, however, *does* incentivize merchants to accept BTC -- and to drop their prices accordingly.
As a bitmit merchant myself, I know this to be true, because when I accept a USD payment, I should expect a *guaranteed loss* from inflation if I hold the USD. When I accept BTC, given the past few years' track record of growth (and my projections of BTC's further growth), I expect a certain degree of value appreciation over time from the BTC I hold.
To me that seems pretty basic, not a rationalization at all. And most of the non technical people I talk about bitcoin with grasp this fact very quickly. It is probably the  factor in convincing normal folks to accept BTC.

2. Sell your coins outside of the banking network ("Never let em know your next move")
3. Always use escrow / Never FE ("Never trust no-bo-dy")
4. Never keep your long position in a hot wallet with access to Satoshi Dice ("Never get high on your own supply")
5. Always use tor ("Never sell no coins where you rest at")
6. Never loan an appreciating currency to someone who is going short on it ("That goddamn credit, dead it. You think pirateat40's payin you back, shit, forget it")
7. Never give your family's address on SR orders ("Keep your family and business completely separated")
8. Use two-factor brain wallets so you cannot be easily extorted ("Never keep no weight on you")
9. If you invent a cryptocurrency, don't give a talk for the CIA, or people will
 make annoying youtube conspiracy videos about you ("If you ain't gettin bags, stay the fuck from police")

coins go up in value =&gt; merchants have incentive to accept BTC (early stage) and reduce prices (later, after prices are no longer tied to USD/other fiat)
prices falling =&gt; incentive to spend coins
just like the bids and asks on the exchanges, everyone has a point at which they will no longer feel they can afford to hold onto their coins. especially for the majority of us, who spend the majority of our income on basic needs.

From what I understand, gold/silver/commodity ETFs in which you can invest with your 401k/IRA will not let you withdraw physical commodities. I think bitcoin would be the same.
This may be due to the tax/penalty typically required for early withdrawal.
I believe there may be some ETFs (for which you wouldn't probably be able to use your 401k/IRA) which might offer physical delivery of goods.

Since they have access to the list of secrets used to generate the hashes, could they not simply time their bet to a winning secret?
From their site:
"In order to ensure that there is no way for the system to change the outcome of a bet, the secret keys used are decided ahead of time. They are not released right away, since they could be used to submit selective transactions and win bets unfairly. However, the hash of the secrets is released. After the secrets are release users can verify that preceeding bets were provably fair."

I'm glad you pointed out drug prohibition as a reason why bitcoin could be successfully banned. If you reflect momentarily you should see why this demonstrates that your point is wrong.
Weed is an herb, literally a weed that grows naturally from the ground. It's resilient, grows in almost every climate. A single plant can certainly produce a quarter-pound (4 ounces) *or more* of cured buds. The shit literally grows anywhere.
And yet, thanks to drug prohibition, an ounce of bud sells for anywhere from $100 to $500 USD. Prohibition keeps the price artificially high. Because the price is so high (for a plant that grows *freely*), it's more profitable to sell, and therefore you can get it on almost any corner in almost any city in the US.
I would say it's pretty clear that prohibition is an utter failure, if it was intended to do anything other than increase the cost and availability of the product which is prohibited.

Given all of BFL's preorder delays, it seems reasonable to ask them to pay an interest rate on the preorder funds before you agree to send them any money.

Such a change would affect anyone running the affected code. You could verify signatures, as one step, and examine the patches yourself, as a more robust step.
If you were a bank, or otherwise handling a large amount of funds, you would be paying security engineers to pore over the code and review its integrity.

You may be right. That's why I upvote articles about Silk Road. Because it is one of bitcoin's best strengths.
Long run, I don't fear a ban hurting bitcoin value at all. Prohibition sure hasn't hurt drug prices.

Consider these simple facts, then you will understand why I recommend waiting (and going long on BTC instead)
1) The difficulty is going to drop as ASICs penetrate the market. This will decrease their profitability relative to price.
2) There are a *lot* of preorders already paid, which have yet to ship.
3) The ASIC manufacturers will recuperate their initial investments with only a small amount of sales.
4) Once  is true, ASIC manufacturers will have very little incentive not to enter a price war with each other.
I expect as a result, ASIC prices are going to plummet. That's what I'm waiting for (well, you know, aside from actual deliveries, other than jgarzik)

Reducing the available supply relatively increases the cost of obtaining coins on the market. That is good because it encourages others to move more of their fiat assets into bitcoin (or accept bitcoins as payment) on expectation of value appreciation. And people who are holding bitcoins have more incentive to spend bitcoins than do people who are holding fiat. That helps the whole bitcoin economy and encourages more sellers to accept them.
@_date: 2013-02-22 20:26:42
So how exactly do "bitcoins work with certain laws"? Don't you mean, bitcoin-using companies will have to work with certain laws? Or rather, certain laws will have to be adapted/interpreted to work with bitcoin?

My understanding is that such a protocol exists. Actual trading may  be occurring but for any real scale to emerge, the client applications will need to be improved substantially. I believe this protocol of colored coins on top of the existing blockchain is actually a bit simpler than, for example, Open Transactions or other similar attempts to do so without using the BTC blockchain.

Weed seems most likely to be legalized in most places, and coincidentally, it is the one that is also most likely to be intercepted in shipping. So I think as long as some drugs are illegal, the effect on bitcoin would be very minimal. As long as some things are illegal in some places, some people will sell them for some bitcoins. :)

It doesn't sound crazy to me at all. I think there are other things raising the value than just Kim Dotcom, but I bet if he isn't already buying up large chunks of BTC, he is surely holding onto as much of the BTC revenue as possible, for exactly the reasons you laid out. He very well may need assets for a legal defense again in the future, and BTC is the most seizure-proof asset available. Particularly when his impact on the market is already felt in the increased demand for BTC, he can also thus be somewhat sure of value appreciation or at least stability.

"The deathblow to money fetishism will be struck only upon that stage when the steady growth of social wealth has made us bipeds forget our miserly attitude toward every excess minute of labor, and our humiliating fear about the size of our ration. Having lost its ability to bring happiness or trample men in the dust, money will turn into mere bookkeeping receipts for the convenience of statisticians and for planning purposes. In the still more distant future, probably these receipts will not be needed. But we can leave this question entirely to posterity, who will be more intelligent than we are." -- Leon Trotsky, The Revolution Betrayed

Yeah, the title is unfortunate. Represented and traded, would be a better way of phrasing it. Probably a good reason not to take the bet :)
Assets can be issued on the blockchain which are backed by the issuers with real-world commodities. That would make trading between BTC and commodity-backed-BTC very easy, and therefore would help stabilize the BTC exchange rates quite a bit (not to mention allow trading of commodities outside of regulated exchanges)
to give an example, if OPEC issued oil-backed BTC (i.e. 1 barrel of crude oil pegged to a cryptographically signed satoshi), you and I could trade oil for BTC, without ever trusting that one of us actually had oil. We would just both have to trust that OPEC would honor the signed satoshi with the promised barrel of crude.

Make sure you look at all data (not default of 2 months), then make sure you check "volume in currency" -- indicates the USD value of the volume rather than the BTC value.

Thank you.
However, that's because you are lumping together a lot of disparate groupings as "OWS" which was never really a tight-knit organization at all.
This misconception was in part due to the actions of the NYC General Assembly in one of its relatively early declarations when it announced itself as a "people's movement". But when we say "OWS" we generally only mean the GA.
And let me tell you, the general assemblies, being consensus driven, took different turns at different times. There were a lot of factions trying to control them bureaucratically (sometimes at odds with each other), and there were even alternative GAs launched toward OWS's latter days. And almost all of the real action and movement was occurring outside of the GA, by other autonomous groups, even very early on.
Since a GA is a consensus body, it can only agree to a proposal in the very moment it is proposed. Because by definition consensus is lost when the bodies present in the crowd change -- day by day, or even minute-by-minute during many of the especially long and/or boring assemblies.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but if you are holding, for example, a lot of paper gold, do you really have an incentive to encourage a "run on the banks" scenario with the holder of your gold? If you have any doubts whatsoever, aren't you best off making your physical withdrawals as slowly as needed to avoid tipping anyone else off?
Even Germany expressed publicly that it had no doubts there was real gold behind its paper gold, when it recently announced it would be withdrawing its physical gold holdings from the US. They wouldn't want to stir up a panic, would they?

I think you'd have to be insane to trust an OS targeted specifically for bitcoin users. 
The odds of something being planted in a reputable gnu/linux distribution to steal your coins would be very low. The odds of something like that in a "Linux Bitcoin OS" would probably be a hell of a lot higher.
Why not just try out a few reputable GNU/Linux distros and see which ones you like?

Leverage still keeps most of the risk on your own funds (not the borrowed ones) as long as you set an appropriate ask order for your margin call.
Good points about the fees, that's what has been holding me back from trying it too. I wonder if anyone can recommend a card that offers a 0% APR with no fees on cash advances.
One option would be to buy goods on the card and sell them on bitmit.net -- that lets you bypass cash advance fee AND boost the bitcoin economy when doing your leverage trading.

Bitcoin is also valuable as a store of value because of its scarcity (and because it is guaranteed some market value due to its use in wealth transfers)
So it is highly comparable to gold -- only far more useful. Its value should also be measured against its ability to hold and increase value. So far its track record of going up would indicate that it is still in the very beginning of market penetration for both of its uses (store and transfer of value). It's going up, there is no bubble about it. The more it goes up, the more useful and appealing it is.

You are correct. However, I think a safer ground for something grey area is just assume it's going to be a prohibitively expensive legal headache, if not actually illegal.
The magic of bitcoin is, it doesn't matter if it's legal or not (and in what jurisidictions) if you do it right. If you pay for servers carefully with cash/bitcoin and leave no trails, you should be able to run your real servers behind a tor hidden service, and set up a reverse proxy in front of them on a normal web address. That way if your front-facing server is shut down, your real servers continue to operate. Then you just set up a new domain name and reverse proxy, and you're back in business, no data lost,

1) blockchain.info shouldn't matter where you are.
2) you should be sure that you save backup copies of your wallet including the private keys. there is an option to automatically email you an encrypted backup. make sure you use it, because you need a new backup each time you generate a new address.

I dunno, both my mom and pop own some bitcoins. They aren't techies. They are just convinced of the potential.
@_date: 2013-01-30 20:07:49
That was my attitude for a long time. Then I began to realize bitcoin's potential in reducing the central banks' stranglehold. This is particularly obvious for people in places like Iran, but it is equally true everywhere the bankers/governments rob the working classes through fiat-currency inflation. I do believe bitcoin could be a serious weapon against the bankers and states, but it is also immediately useful in the real world of the 21st century when people really do need to send/receive value across borders without regard to state regulations.
Quite simply, I think there is a complete and total lack of theory in the Marxist tradition (not to mention the goddamn Keynesian tradition) which could account for bitcoin-as-currency. It is simply not a commodity, rather a protocol, therefore failing Marx's definition of money as universal commodity.
The only thing which gives bitcoin its value is subjective demand. I believe there is a need for a kind of "desiring-production" theory of value, following Deleuze/Guattari and incorporating aspects of both the LToV and the subjective theory of value (which were never, contrary to popular belief, at odds).

I don't really think you can measure price inflation in any way but a biased or anecdotal way (example: Argentina, where prices grocery are now government controlled. no price inflation!) And I think that the huge reserves of natural gas discovered recently in the US are keeping price inflation artificially low.
To me the real important figure is monetary inflation. Since they don't publicize M3, we don't know exactly how bad it is, but something like $85BN/month in QE money printing (or rather in bad debt purchases) is occurring publicly.
So actually it would seem USD monetary inflation has surpassed BTC monetary inflation (which is itself extremely high right now, despite the hemming and hawing of the deflation FUD).

@_date: 2013-02-08 06:00:28
Not at all related to namecoin, you're completely off base. Colored coins is a system for cryptographically issuing assets by "coloring" satoshis or other units of bitcoin and thereby publicly earmarking them as some other asset (given extra value on top of BTC face value only insofar as buyers of these coins will trust the asset-issuers). In other words, they are "stocks" which can be issued by anyone, for any reason, at any time, from any place, without regard for any legality, and can be traded without the existence of any stock exchanges. And since they operate on the existing blockchain, no extra mining is necessary. Just like bitcoin, their issuers are pseudonymous -- verifiably consistent, but only as identified as they want to be (and as their investors require... or not).
@_date: 2013-02-15 04:40:40

@_date: 2013-02-03 01:13:48
Good points, but let's look at an example. Say you want to invest $100 in bitcoin, and you consider this to be lost money regardless of the outcome. Let's assume the exchange rate is USD$20/1BTC.
For 2:1 leverage, you take out a $100 loan (assume 0% interest for simplicity's sake) and set a margin call ask order somewhere slightly above $10. Meaning the price would have to fall all the way to $10 before you cut your losses and auto-sell (leaving you enough $ left over to repay the loan, despite your loss). Any smaller drops, and you could hold your long position.
But if the price rises only 25% up to USD$25/1BTC, and you sell, you've made a 50% profit of $50 on your $100 investment. If you didn't use leverage, you would have made half the profit -- only 25%, or $25 on your $100.
To me, it seems that for a small-time investor who is operating as if their investment is just a high-risk gamble, a small leverage like 2:1 or 3:1 might make a lot of sense. There are not a lot of time periods when BTC price falls even 33% (for a 3:1) let alone 50% (for 2:1).

Because the .7-compatible chain is also compatible with .8. There are a number of people using .7 software still, so they would effectively be segregated if .8 miners continued to do what they are doing. That's what caused the blockchain split in the first place -- a bug in .7 was revealed by miners using .8, creating a second, .8-only but .7-incompatible blockchain.
The .7-compatible blockchain is the preferred one because it is universally usable by all software versions.

Yes, unless someone manages to control a botnet of ASIC miners. And you can bet your ass that any mining operation is going to notice pretty damn quick if they aren't getting the coins from their mining.
I guess the possibility for double spend exists, but the odds of accumulating a large ASIC botnet are probably quite close to nil.

There are already competing virtual currencies to bitcoin. Is it often that you go to a merchant and they only want your litecoins, terracoins, devcoins, freicoins?
You can rest assured that if someone has a satoshi that guarantees them a % ownership in a company, they will not be spending it like a normal satoshi. They would trade it to someone who knows what they want, because it is worth more than a normal satoshi (and to different people).

Made me wonder if they don't allow open API access just so they can get your idea and then implement it themselves. I would have guessed that if they were themselves uninterested in the idea, they would have replied to me. Since they didn't, it made me wonder if they were already considering accepting bitcoin.

Well, if someone put in a large bid and another bidder sniped at them with smaller bids, each time the high bid is bumped up, it would appear that the high bidder bid again, when in fact they may not have.
That said, attempting to negotiate a better price after holding an auction by betting/winning it is a common tactic used by asshole buyers on bitmit. Just be firm with them and ask them to take it up with bitmit support.

All good questions. I personally don't like the idea of demurrage, but I guess it doesn't matter, I'll simply hold a currency which is most likely to appreciate -- deflation doesn't bother me at all, quite the opposite. I think bitcoin is not at all incompatible with other virtual currencies which could function in similar/different ways. 
I think if you really believe deflation is an issue, you might want to consider working out the economics involved in a new currency that solves the problem.

Bitcoin exchange rate is not in a bubble. Bitcoin is a veblen good. As its exchange rate grows, demand also grows, because it is proving itself to be the *best and rarest store of value in the world.*
This talk about a bubble is useful, in that it helps keep us from entering a bubble. But in reality, the only way we can all maximize our benefit is if we all buy and hold bitcoins. This way the price continues to rise, demand continues to rise, merchants have greater incentive to accept bitcoins, and there is less incentive to sell bitcoins (because the more of us hold them, the more steadily the exchange rate rises).
BUY AND HOLD! Fuck the prisoner's dilemma!

1. Lack of competition. Accepting bitcoin should be significantly cheaper for you than accepting credit cards, even if you do convert payments immediately to fiat, so just be decent and offer a BTC discount.
2. Just use an API to automatically tie your price to USD-BTC exchange rate
3. I'm not gonna run your client, but I might pay you for storage service if you offer it via a standard protocol (rsync+ssh, DAV, HTTPS/object-based...), so that I have no need at all to trust your potentially insecure (or intentionally bugged) software. No offense, but why should I trust the quality of code I can't review?
4. Coinbase and Bitpay are the best-known for automatic conversion to fiat. If you want to just accept bitcoins, though, you could just use the bitcoind API or the lazy API:

Honestly though there are way too many outstanding preorders from too many companies to make it smart to buy right now.

Just buy a small amount from each of your paychecks over time. This technique is called dollar cost averaging. It will help you accumulate savings in bitcoin, while keeping your average costs low by evening them out over time. It is also a way to discipline yourself not to buy during periods of bubble growth.
I don't think now is a particularly bad time to buy though. I expect we will reach and hold parity with 1 troy oz of silver (~$30) within a few weeks at the most.

1) Known protocol for halving monetary inflation means bitcoin is a long-term store of value.
2) Irreversible transactions make bitcoin valuable to merchants, who can enjoy a higher profit rate when using it.
3) Distributed nature means bitcoin cannot actually be shut down. If they worry about it, just have them reflect on how alcohol/drug prohibition don't actually reduce availability but only raise prices. Then point out that bitcoin can be sent/received from anywhere in the world, without smuggling across borders. This is my favorite part. A ban would clearly raise, not diminish, the spending power of bitcoin.

Just an example bro. There are tons of ways to spend bitcoins, and the options are increasing. We have an incentive to hold bitcoins when we understand that *relative to fiat* its value is increasing. We also have an incentive to spend them by simple virtue of holding our assets in bitcoin rather than fiat. A lot of us simply prefer bitcoin as a more convenient, safer payment method than mailing cash or even using Paypal. And spending is always going to be at least a certain constant because people have to eat, so I really don't buy the deflationary spiral BS.
Though, the deflationary spiral myth is actually good marketing, in the form of a self-fulfilling prophecy since the value of bitcoin appreciates when more people save in bitcoin... And more people saving in bitcoin simply gives more merchants incentive to offer more good/services for bitcoins and to lower their prices...

The cool part of the bitcoin social contract is that indeed, everyone has their own version of it, which everyone else is free to reject. You don't have to agree that SD is a problem. But if you do, there is a patch provided for miners to use to avoid including SD transactions in processed blocks.

I totally agree with you. I look forward to when gas stations, newstands, etc. sell prepaid bitcoin cards just like phone cards. It would be so easy to market these too -- they could have a bunch of cards in stock, and only have a few funded, to isolate themselves from exchange rate risk.
I bet the demand would be so high that they could price a few dollars over the spot value too.

Personally I care more about my purchasing power with BTC than I do about any public perception of it. And I don't think you can find a much better market for bitcoin than drugs.
Plus, hey, look on the bright side. As the public realizes that they can actually buy drugs easier online with bitcoins than with fiat, then at least a few are smart enough to start holding more bitcoin (driving up our purchasing power further)

TL;DR summary of the video
Gavin spoke with the CIA's venture capital firm. The CIA is probably looking for new kinds of money to use for running drugs, so naturally bitcoin is a great choice. The dollar is collapsing because it is digital (apparently this has nothing to do with QE... lol), and therefore, bitcoin will inevitably collapse too. Oh and by the way, it's a ponzi scheme run by the CIA.
This guy recommends you get your wealth out of bitcoins and dollars "before" the impending collapse of both as a result of the digitalization of the dollar (as if this wasn't already 97% complete...). And yet for some reason the CIA wants to use bitcoin even though it's collapsing. 
By the way, this must all be true because Gavin spoke with the CIA in the same month as the June 2011 "crash".
Actually, upon reflection, I think this video is a really smart troll (falsely stupid) put out by someone who is bullish on bitcoin and wants to keep the price artificially low so they can stock up before the exchange rate ramp up continues even further.

ummm, no, not every ASIC will produce similar income whether early or late, simply by virtue of producing the same hashrate. please don't spread this misinformation!
the higher the difficulty, the lower the income produced by a given hashrate. the late ASICs into the game will produce less income.
and further, once the ASIC manufacturers cover their bottom lines and the ASIC incomes also start to drop, we can expect HUGE price slashings on the ASICs for sale. so at *current ASIC prices*, the latest ASICs into the game could easily be quite unprofitable. after ASIC prices drop, this could have a balancing effect for the *very late* into the game (but not for anyone who pays current prices and gets an ASIC late)

I'm saying if you don't already have a plan indicating it to be a profitable move, you should not invest money into GPU or FPGA mining. I am not saying you should not mine with your current hardware. Only you (and the various bitcoin mining profitability calculators) can determine if that makes sense. Just don't waste any more money on fixed capital that will be useless in a few weeks (or days) as ASICs continue to hit the scene.
I am downvoting you for your own good. We get asked this question a lot. I would not want to encourage, even by lack of downvotes, you or all the other newbies to waste hundreds or thousands on equipment which will barely even generate revenue in a very short period of time.

Did you see if anyone nearby you sells bitcoins for cash, for example on  Or try  Both of those methods are very easy if you are already holding a pile of cash that you want to convert.
Credit cards are an easy (and expensive) way to send money, but they also require the merchant to foot the entire fraud risk. There will likely never be a way to buy bitcoins with a currency that you can get back by simply calling up your credit card company and giving them a sob story about how your goods were not as described. There is no way in those cases for the bitcoin vendor to recover their product.

Any miners which continue mining with .8 software without adjusting maxblocksize will be carrying forward an alternate blockchain that is incompatible with .7 software. The devs are in the process of getting all .8 miners to adjust their maxblocksize, or downgrade to .7, and to mine only on the .7-compatible blockchain.
Until this is resolved, new transactions could potentially be on either the .7-compatible chain, the .8-only chain, or both. When the dust settles (give it a day at the most) we'll all move forward using only a single chain again.
Most likely effect on exchange rate: sharp dip right now, while confusion reigns, then a bounce back up above the previous high when everyone realizes there was nothing to be lost.
