I guess it works for some people? Did you get any more or...?

Merchants who use PayPal and Bitcoin, for the most part, want an easy trading system. That's where we, the middle men such as Virwox, WSC, and BitBooth come in to play. I also don't disagree with your point of avoiding new and untested things. Sure, we can promise this and that and bluff ourselves to the moon, but actually trying the service will verify its validity.

We have changed our fee to 15%. Sorry for the troubles.
We also are federally obligated to take documentation. It is also for the safety of our new and fragile business. Illegal activity to cash out via Bitcoin from stolen or fraudulent PayPal accounts is very common. This is just a small step to ensure our safety.

We follow the Privacy Act to ensure our customers are safe. But, we also can **not** ensure that we aren't selling to someone committing identity theft. There are no failsafe ways to deter these acts, but the documentation requirements deter most acts. Sure, someone can slip by PayPal security and manage to have correct matching documentation, but the odds of that are low. If fraudulent activity is detected we will contact [authorities]( And to the chargebacks, we charge a 15% fee to help build up protection against loss of funds. We can not win all chargebacks or disputes, but we can try to stop most of it.
