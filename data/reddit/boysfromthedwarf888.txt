Ah those wonderful "people who know better" 
glad to see you putting yourself in that category not alongside us idiotic luddites.
why is it so difficult for you to reply to someone on reddit without sounding so condescending or superior ?
@_date: 2019-11-23 04:14:32
um... I don't think the people of the world had much of a say when they abandoned the gold standard.

localbitcoins.com is not the same as that shitty BCASH Roger Ver scam site local.bitcoin.com
@_date: 2019-10-08 23:03:41
I wouldn't eat or drink that shit for free tbh. let alone spend worthless paper Fiat.... spend my BTC?!?! ARE YOU FUCKING CRAZY?!?!
If I was going to spend BTC on food or drink, it would be for peking Roast duck. or Puer Tea! (I am not Chinese...but good tea and good duck might almost be worth it)
@_date: 2019-10-14 01:47:43
thanks. try getting a straight answer on r/btc or r/bitcoincash is like trying to get blood from a stone. 
what other alt coins do you HODL? (beyond BTC)
@_date: 2019-10-13 01:24:16
you lost a couple hundred BTC? damn...that's gotta hurt. 
just Buy and HODL, you will make your money back eventually.

I use localbitcoins.com you can use WeChat or Alipay and buy there. just don't mention It in your WeChat conversations with people you are buying/selling with
@_date: 2019-10-13 22:48:33
is that why I have Zero btc? (cry emoji)
@_date: 2019-10-08 23:07:30
ART Is the ONLY thing that I have bought, other than BTC recently. ONLY because there will be 21 million BTC, but only ONE of the pieces of art I have bought exists. 
not to say the Bitcoin will/won't be more valuable than the artwork in the future, in fact, I am almost certain the Art will be worth much less than if I had bought BTC. however Art is food for the soul. BTC is just taking "food" away from the Bankers

Ask Satoshi
@_date: 2019-10-13 22:47:05
he has been awfully quiet recently... I wonder if he got scammed ?
@_date: 2019-10-14 01:30:49
whats your opinion of the the Hard forks... e.g.. BCH (Bcash) etc
@_date: 2019-10-06 02:55:14
@_date: 2019-10-03 02:52:11
could you explain in detail why you think so? 
just calling it a scam doesn't make it so...
@_date: 2019-10-08 20:47:31
@_date: 2019-09-12 18:38:10
you sound like such a nice guy... what's wrong with you? 
do you talk to people in the real world like this?
@_date: 2019-09-09 04:12:06
how much did you give away? you can send me $10 worth of BTC if it's not that much to you... :-p
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:14:57
BUY the dip... buy the High. just BUY BUY BUY is the best policy. then HODL and never sell!!!! just wait for mass adoption then use as you like...
@_date: 2019-09-14 02:34:52
no problem at all.... ill take 1% of future sales of the Satoshi made (tm) watch :-p
@_date: 2019-09-13 05:08:50
Good for you!
I hope it is well received.
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:13:19
Damn where were you when I had money???
@_date: 2019-09-14 02:07:38
could you change the "Swiss made" to "satoshi made" ?
@_date: 2019-09-09 04:16:47
you are a joke IMO. how much charitable work to do you do up on your mighty throne? $10 is more than a months wage somewhere like Venezuela. 
Ten years ago some people gave away whole BTC like this, which would have cost less than $10 at the time. made a good little gift for those who kept them. right?
@_date: 2019-09-08 01:59:08
stick it in a blockfi account for 24 months. then sell the interest.

Not sure why you were being down voted. what you said is true. Sweden (and most baltic countries) were extremely safe places to live in the past. I travelled there many times, Denmark, Sweden, Norway all had very high standards of living. everyone was middle class more or less, no extreme poverty, no extreme wealth. very little crime. I always thought they were great countries to raise a family....
The destruction of Europe and western civilisation is 100% done on purpose by TPTB, illegal wars all over the world displacing millions of people. refugees who are forced to leave their homes because of extreme conditions placed upon them by the western war machine. no wonder some of them come to Europe and cause havoc. I don't condone the crimes committed by others, but it is hardly surprising that it is a response to losing everything in your homeland.  
(not saying this is what happened in Norway with this Bitcoin Millionaire, I am not here to 'blame refugees'! just commenting on how Sweden HAS become the rape capital of Europe and possibly the world!)
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:15:44
better than spending 11,000BTC for two though :-p
@_date: 2019-09-12 19:49:25
just as an aside to the OP. I have somehow been dragged into r/btc after commenting in this thread. 
I mistakenly thought I was replying here, only to find out seconds after I commented, that I had indeed been commenting in r/btc. 
Not happy that they have to trick people into buying BCH instead of Bitcoin, they have to hijack threads in r/bitcoin as well...
Whats wrong with them?
@_date: 2019-09-12 18:46:51
ok if you say so
if there ever was a Pot calling the kettle black. it would be you... 
you sound so fucking bitter. you can't possibly have a decent life. so "ok I will deal with it"
@_date: 2019-09-08 01:46:39
THIS exactly!
@_date: 2019-09-09 14:27:02
Is that how you judge yourself?  with up votes on reddit? 
no ethical or moral compass required, no compassion or thought for others... up votes is enough. 
good luck with that.
@_date: 2019-09-12 17:20:08
There was LITERALLY a poster the other day, who posted saying "shit! help me, just bought BCH instead of BTC!" using this very same platform...
@_date: 2019-09-09 04:26:48
Congratulations... this is what happens when you post comments like this, you become a dick! I would rather be cheap &amp; thoughtful than someone like you...
@_date: 2019-09-12 18:57:45
yes it sure sounds great mate. keep it up, you are winning at the game of life, that is 100% not fake news
@_date: 2019-09-12 17:21:27
GO BACK! tell them what is what... in a polite and cordial manner. and explain how they have been duped!
@_date: 2019-09-14 02:13:34
fuck the Banks.
