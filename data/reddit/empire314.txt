Also you are much more privledged than the "greedy people" in india, even if they dont. But I guess since you still have the view that its ok for you to critisize people from other countries, but impossible to help people from other countries, there is not much use in speaking reason to you.

Because tomorrow Alice wants her money back, and the bank only has a fraction of it left. Every fractional reserve bank has always had the ability to create their own money to fix this issue. Of course there never will be a central bank that could create Bitcoin.
There is a reason why Bitcoin, and most other cryptos, are considered to be anti-bank currencies. "Be your own bank" and all that, because its not possible to do banking with Bitcoin in any way resembling what it is today. My last comment was just pointing out an issue that would arise if banks as we know it wouldnt exist.

Investors want at least 15% yearly return on their investment. The reason banks can give loan at such a low interest rate, is because they dont give away their money, they create money to give.

Then how about you use any of the 500 cryptos that are much better for that?

The most recent maybe not, but most investors definetly have.
The reason ETH is at +50% of BTC market cap, is because the same "crypto investors" are betting on both.
BTC is more like babys first crypto investment, but only the BTC hardcore fanboys stay in Bitcoin only, others go invest in many cryptos.
The people who only know about Bitcoin through off hand mentions mostly wont buy any crypto.

Arguments like this are silly. You are basicly talking about what is the minimum requierement to run whichever blockchain.
At the moment there is over 100million dollars worth of electronics hashing bitcoins alone. And billions have been spent on the electricity to run those things.
Wether or not running a full node requieres you to have 100USD or even 100 000USD worth of storage, is compleatly meaningless.
The recourses poured into mining bitcoin could easily handle 10GB blocks.

Bitcoin is a decentralized system, meaning there is no official name, and people can call it what ever they want, without being wrong by any means. And you, r/bitcoin or any other community is absolutely no one to decide what goes.
But yes. People calling it "Bitcoin Core" mostly do it for exactly the same reason people here call their coin as BCash. To downplay competition.
@_date: 2018-01-10 05:15:22
Inflation actually means you pay less for your loans, than you would with same interest rate.
If you have to pay back mortage in deflationary currency, then you are doomed. Imagine you took a 500 000BTC loan 6 years ago to buy house. You would still maybe have 450 000BTC left to pay. Good luck getting 450 000BTC now to pay the rest for your house which is worth less than 50BTC.
Ofcourse in the future there wont be hyper deflation in BTC like the past 6 years, but any deflation means that almost no one can afford to take any loans.
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:16:57
Yeah but what ever story one can make telling that competing crypto is bad, this a sub will swallow like a chocolate frosted strawberry.
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:54:50


The proponents of that coin call it Bitcoin Cash mostly because they think it is "Real Bitcoin". And their endgame is to have it be called just Bitcoin if it becomes popular enough. Which is a compleatly understandable opinion, as Bitcoin was designed to be forkable, but of course you are free to support which chain you want.


That is in no way a logical argument, even if we took for granted that "Bitcoin Cash" is deceptive marketing. A scam can be competition as well.

Fractional reserve banking way predates fiat, but what ever.
Not too long ago, people mostly either lived in what ever their employer directly provided to them, or they would die in the same house they were born in.
Fractional reserve banking was a huge driving force in boosting colonialism and country expansion, since it allowed more people to be able to get a living place (and business) somewhere else.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:34:25




You really should not include percentages in your comments, if you are unable to do basic math.
Also the point I wanted to make that the reason you pay +50% taxes and still live in great wealth, is most likely just because you were born into a much more privileged position. Its not because of your hard work that allows you to give and still live wealthy.
Still you are complaining about others being greedy, when you would never be ok with living in the conditions they do.
@_date: 2018-01-01 13:34:05
1. You have no argument for is BCH competing or not. Even if it is not a legitimate alt coin, it can be a competitor. And it is.
2. Bitcoin is specificly desinged to be able to be forked. Also Bitcoin is inherintly decentralized, which by definition means that Roger Ver has as much say on what should happen to Bitcoin as any other person or a community of people does. Wheter or not you or anyone else want to follow, is entirely up to them.
3. Ver owns less than 1% of the Bitcoin Cash, and also almost exactly as much BTC. If you have somekind of personal vendetta against Ver, know that you are playing into his pocket whether you support BTC or BCH. Every dollar in value that BTC rises, is $100 000 of profit for him. If for what ever reason you choose to make your decisions based on your personal problems with the guy, go choose an altcoin where he isnt one of the biggest players, and leave Bitcoin and all its variants for good.

Banks have been creating their own money for over 500 years. There is nothing modern about that, now its just more regulated.
"Lending" has existed in some form since dawn of time, but you are out of your fucking mind if you think a random 25 year old could just go get enough money to buy a home from someone, and tell them to he pay back later. That is untill modern banking existed ofcourse.

You are wrong already there. Bitcoin has exactly one founder.


For ICO, premined coins are literally sold with the promise that the money is used for development. With Bitcoin, the early adopters own their Bitcoin. They have no responsibility to fund jack shit. Its economically much smarter to hope that someone else does it. And if Satoshi moved any of his 1million bitcoin, it would cause the money to crash. You lose anyway.

Guys if bitcoin is compleatly decentralized, how does this Satoshi guy have any power over anything?
@_date: 2015-06-21 22:42:02
The price of one bitcoin now is what it is because of the 21million cap. Next year the cap will remain the same. It was also the same when bitcoin was at 1000$. Bitcoin price did not change at the last halving either.
That is reason  you are wrong.
But even if we ignore reason  there is other thing. Your math is flawed. If there is avrage 880k flowing into bitcoin every day now, and it continues the same rate after the halving, it will bearly affect the price at all anyway. You see almost 15million bitcoin have been mined already. If 440k of the increase goes to "funding" new coins every day, and 440k goes to increasing the price of existing ones, that is only an increase of 3cents per day per bitcoin.
That is reason  you are wrong.
But thanks for trying thou. Kinda reminds me of the post how obvious it is that bitcoin price will be at 10k by end of 2014.

Yes because some businesses cant accept digital payments for what ever reasons, the problem would be fixed if we make them not be able to receive physical payments. Also it takes me 3 seconds to pick a 2euro coin from my pocket if I want to buy something from the street, no electrical currency yet can operate that fast. Let alone how inconviniet it might be for some people to receive non cash.
2. "Less privacy and more goverment spying on every citizen is a good thing"
3. How about get rid of just the small coins then? Nobody wants them anyway.
4. What the fuck am i even reading

With some exceptions, Bitcoin is not something that gets consumed. This means that as long new bitcoins are mined, there is an increased supply. When the last bitcoin gets mined, then we will have a stable supply. Mining rate lowering = slower increase of supply. The price only rises if there is higher increase of demand than the increase of supply is. This is also how you should do your calculations.

People who have a goal to kill as many people possible are extreamly rare. Like andres breivik and some of the car bombings in islamic nations come to mind. But other than that the mass murderers have just chose to not kill so many people. I mean with the available resourses anyone who actually tries to should be able to kill atleast 40 people before they are stopped. Think about overdosing food supplies with medicine, throwing multiple self made granades, shooting people in a tightly packed event with your semi auto from like 5th floor window, driving through people with a truck. Etc. Etc.
The reason and the only reason why there are so few of these big mass murders is because there is almost no one who wants to do them. Goverment regulations have nothing to do with it.

Pretty much all of the negative features you listed about electronic fiat currency only exist because it was designed so. 
PayPal and VISA might as well not keep any record of transactions, offer refunds to anyone or require non anonymous registration. The reason they do these is because it was decided its better this way.
Of course its arguable that they are wrong and you are right. Except in the case that bitcoin could be used by the poorest of the poor. Good luck using bitcoin without electricity, let alone the internet, that is a feature reserved for cash or other physical things.

Its just the law of supply and demand. When you want to sell BTC for be it fiat, goods or services the price lowers. When you buy BTC the price increases. The best and pretty much only way to raise the price is to buy and hodl, this way you increase the demand and lower the supply. If you use BTC for shopping or donate it away, the price will decrease unless the person you give it to hodls aswell. The only way online tipping could possibly help bitcoin value is if the person collects the tip and decides to buy more because of it and not spend it. In other words dont fucking tip if you want the price to increase.
There is nothing evil or short term thinking in anything these companies do. The purpose of these companies is not to raise the value of bitcoin. Their purpose is to provide the service which they do. If you think everyone should be playing the game for your or someone elses personal advantage you just dont understand economy or business.

After it hit $1000, the most popular opinion in this sub was that bitcoin would be $1 000 000 by the start of 2017. Because it was supposed to increase 10fold every year.
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:20:08
I havent sent money to korea, but I have done many international transfers to many different countries.
The fee has always been exactly 0, and the transaction time has always been 1-2 days. If I gave my debit card number, then it took again, 2 seconds.
It migth be true that in 0.00001% of cases, bitcoin transfer migth be preferable, but you have to be extreamly dellusional if you think that from the point of user general experience, bitcoin is anything else than compleate shit compared to what fiat offers.

Yes banks do spend a lot of money for all of the services they provide, including security.
But the point I was trying to make is that the service fees that might occur to some people from using their credit card or what ever service the bank decides to provide, is almost compleatly meaningless in terms of what money the banks use to finance their services. Their money comes not just from bailouts, but also fractional reserve banking. When you go and loan money from the bank, they dont give the money from their vaults or savings. They just create the money out of thin air. They get paid interest for lending money they dont even have. Its the exact same as you printing some dollar notes from computer and using those to go to the store to buy food. But its just you go to jail if you get caught, banks are allowed to do it.
This is also one of the reasons why I am very doubtful of Bitcoins success. Bitcoin has many features, but a lot of the times the services of the banks are just much better. Thats because some has to upkeep and develop all that shit, and its not free. They need to be paid by the users. Banks can just create money to finance superior systems. Pretty much all of the features I see getting hyped on r/bitcoin are something I could do using the banks services 5 years earlier. And the anonymous and what not "advantages" bitcoin has is just preference. Banks very much have all the resources and technology to do all that with fiat, its just they have their own reasons why they dont. Its kinda like banks are this guy who you dont like, but the guy owns all of the buildings in the world so you have to deal with him if you want someplace to live in. Bitcoin is like a tent that you can live in if you are willing to give up your luxury to not deal with the guy.

So whats the difference of owning 1000 coins and an infinite amount of 100 coins?
@_date: 2017-04-20 10:02:27


So bitcoin is the only meaningful one just because its the most popular at this moment?
If crypto currency does become the most popular form of money in the world, what makes you so sure that bitcoin will remain the dominant one? The most compelling reason to use any crypto currency that is that its non centralized, as in its free game for anyone. Then how is it ok that 77% of all available bitcoins are claimed already despite the fact that only a miniscule fraction of the world population has any. Most people dont even know what bitcoin is.
Im not ok with the fact how goverments and banks have unfair controll of fiat, and neither am I ok how few selected people would own the vast majority of all the currency in the world simply because they invested on it early.
If you are an early adopter I can see how you are ok personally with becomming the equilavant of a billionare simply for putting on few thousand dollars before.
Bitcoiners say how bad inflation is, yet they want most of the world population to be ok with how their euros and dollars are suddently only worth one billionth compared to the early bitcoins.
A much more legimate currency would be one where less than 10% of coins are mined when it becomes the money of choise, meaning that anyone can work to receive their share of the remaining 90%.
@_date: 2015-07-16 11:37:20
Actually there are tons of ways to destroy bitcoin. Goverments could create really harsh taxes on bitcoin use or make it directly illeagal. Also you can do a 50% attack if you just buy enough computing power. Other crypto currencies also have a theoretical chance to take over bitcoins role.
@_date: 2017-04-22 21:11:14
Either way its almost compleatly semantics. The person will equal of having an infinite amount of bitcoins and the system is dead.
@_date: 2017-04-22 11:18:28

Explain to me why bitcoins are not worthless tokens.
@_date: 2017-04-20 20:11:17
Do I look like some kind of god?
Anyway after doing no research I could imagine something like where at start it gets mined slow, then gets fast and in the end slows down to almost nothing. So ideally it would be like
1. Few people on it at start, and only few coins get mined.
2. The masses jump on board as the mine rate picks up, then majority of people have acsess to the majority of coins.
3. As the money is in good circulation around the people, then the inflation can stop.
I think that would be much more reasonable than the bitcoin model of
1. If you want some of the money better jump on board now to this questionable currency.
2. Good job, now you and the few other individuals who hold most of the coins go and try to make other people want it so what you bought gets value. Better work hard. If you do it you become rich.
@_date: 2017-04-20 20:16:56
Do you think that by buying bitcoin and giving that to companies who immidietly convert it back to fiat you are using any less countrys currency than by using a mastercard?
@_date: 2017-04-21 06:01:01


Very indirectly. I would assume that a bitcoiner would agree on this. Banks do not get their security or revenue from the fees their customers pay. They get them from the financial privledges of bailouts and being able to lend money they dont even have. So in a way one "pays" for the insurance just by being part of the society. I put "pay" in quotation marks because its questionable wether this injustice is actually good for the general market.
@_date: 2017-04-22 11:13:34
Guy comes here and ask to be corrected, and you act angry because he is not correct.
@_date: 2017-04-20 20:37:42
I give you permisionless, borderless and anonymous compared to mastercard.
But the last two are attributes of holding bitcoin, the opposite of selling it, which you do by buying stuff with it. And I honestly think you underestimate the goverment on your last claim. Goverment is as in much controll of your bitcoin usage as they are in any usage of the internet. Sure its possible to use it even if its get outlawed. You can also plan terrorist attacks on the internet, but sometimes people get caught and in general its really inconvinient to do it hidden.
But remember that it also suffers from some of those points. If someone robs your fiat bank account, you can get your money back. If someone forces you to make a transaction or tell your password, your money are gone forever. And the goverment cant print bitcoin either to give you welfare.

1. Because of the ability for areas to change in that aspect. My country didnt have any sort of metallurgy 600 years ago, and was probably the least developed area in all of Europe untill 100 years ago. These days we are one of the tech leaders of the world, and we give shit for countries like Spain for their poor economy.
2. Because sub saharan Africa is extreamly diverse on that aspect. For example Gabon has higher GDP per capita than Poland. Treating sub saharan africa as a homogeneous area for any aspect really shows nothing except your ignorance. The area itself is twice as large as Europe.

History and the present time both say that a violent revolution is possible. Its funny that you talk so much about history in your comments, but everything you say is pretty much based on what you see on domestic news.
Its true that USA civillians would never beat the USA army in a straight up war, but the reality is that no civil war has ever been like that, and no civil war will ever be either.
Ideally the revolutionist will get stronger arms through many different channels so its not the semi automatic civillian guns that win the war, but they certainly help a lot.
You also need to consider the fact that the government can not go all out against its own country. The infrastructure needs to be kept intact.
There is a reason why 99% of Syria is still intact and why Assad has not won the Syrian war yet.

If you buy crypto with fiat, only to convert that crypto back to fiat every time you make a purchase you are doing nothing else than lying to yourself that you are not using fiat. It in no way helps Bitcoin unless you consider giving some extra cash to the middleman operating the crypto debit card or increasing transaction fees a benefit.
I did read your claim that you somehow save money by doing this, but I really dont think its even possible in theory that it is more efficient than just converting crypto to fiat in bulk, and then paying straight out of your fiat balance.

They are necerssary, but also people should be aware and accept the risk.
Any time one moves their coins to an adress that they dont controll, be it an exchange or a purchase of a house, they should know there is a good chance they will never see any return. Only safe way is to send the coins after you recieved your goods.
Fault is a bad word, but they took a risk and it didnt pay off this time.
If anyone thinks these rules are unreasonable, they should stat away from crypto. Using a centralized bank would have helped in this situation.

I mean why would the merchant need to do any partnering at all at that stage?
The customer could just use a LN version of those "Bitcoin depitcards" that convert your BTC to fiat.
Customer sends money to LN company which sends fiat to merchant. Merchant doesnt even know or care if customer sent BTC or fiat originally.
The only difference would be that then the merchant could fish for the Bitcoin fanboys that favor companies who "Accept Bitcoin". But I guess thats the reason 99% of the companies who accept Bitcoin via mainchain today do it.

This does nothing to the fact that Bitcoin needs to be sent to the LN chain that goes to the merchant via the main Bitcoin blockchain. And after the settlement the bitcoin needs to be sent again on the main blockchain to another address. An extra transaction will occur at worst.
The only way LN can possibly help a merchant that isnt willing to hold any BTC, is if you use LN to send BTC to a third party, and then the third party sends fiat to the merchant.

But if you think that Bitcoin is guranteed to go over 20k again, you are nothing more than ignorant. Despite the relativly high value, bitcoin is atm facing bigger problems than ever before internally, and the competition is fierce. 2017 was much more the year of crypto than it was year of Bitcoin.
Even if bitcoin does continue to grow the way it has since its birth, 25k value in 2months is statisticly extreamly unlikely. After a big drop, the avrage time to reach a new ATH is over 12 months.

The problem is that you dont understand how supply and demand works. The more people want to use their bitcoins, the more supply there is. That is essentially selling your bitcoins for other goods and services or other currency, this can only ever decrease the price.
The way bitcoins price would rise through supply and demand is if everyone just wanted to hoard more and more bitcoin and NOT use them or give them away in any other way. 
Everything has a price which means that if the price of bitcoin is at 200$ and there are more people willing to buy bitcoin than sell, the price keep rising until it gets balanced out. Because rising bitcoin price many times leads to people wanting to hoard more and less people willing to sell or give away, we often get a chain reaction of a skyrocketing price. It also works the exact same way downwards.
This is basic economics. Either you did not understand who taught you basic econimics, or the teacher did not know what he was talking about. Dont worry thou, you are iin a likewise community where most people here dont know what the fuck is going on.

I mean stock market is a somewhat regulated system. There are laws against some insider trading. Sure some people ignore these laws and get away with it, but compared to that Bitcoin is the wild fest. Also MtGox and smaller incidents are very common in BTC trading, when ofc its not really a thing in stock trading.


It is unless you believe the Bitcoin infrastructure is worth +100billion USD. Sure we can act like the 10million BTC people have been hodling since  2013 have created more value than what have been lost to transaction fees and middleman fees, but I like to think that the market cap is only what people really would be willing to pay if all BTC was put on sale. Which I think is much closer to 3billion USD.

I mean each link in the ligthning network only has as much btc linked to it, as was originally used to create it. you can never have more bitcoins (from LN) than the sum of all the chains directly connected to you. 
yes you can "replenish" bitcoin you already spent. But if 1bitcoin was used to link you to LN, it means thats impossible for you to ever owm more than 1bitcoin without another transaction in 1st layer.

The only way people can retain their BTC in a forked chain, is if they can use their old private key to access funds in the fork. A powerful quantum computer can crack the private key in the current chain, therefore it could always also access the fork.
Centralized databases can create entirely new passwords from scratch, and have people get them through personal authentication.

The success of previous forks is hardly relevant in the question of is Bitcoin supposed to be forked or not. And so is this concept of "consensus". The point of decentralization is that small players can follow their own path if they want to. And that worst thing the majority can do is cry in reddit about scams and class action lawsuits that are never going to happen.
Anyway its debatable wether or not the blocksize should be increased now. But what is a fact is that its impossible for bitcoin to ever be a global currency with 1MB blocks, no matter what layer 2 workarounds people try to use.
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:59:27
No. Quantum proof encryption is possible. Its just due to the decentralized nature of Bitcoin that it cant be fixed for BTC.

No. Its theoretically impossible for bitcoin to become a usable world currency even with lightning if blocksize stays at 1MB.
To open a single ligthning connection for your Bitcoins, a transaction on main blockchain needs to be made. And if you want to ever increase your balance, you need to make a 2nd transaction.
However that is impossible for universal global bitcoin, because people are being born too fast for them to be ever able to do 2 transactions in their entire lifetime.
Assuming a static population, it would take 136 years for everyone to get their first fraction of a Bitcoin.
If by global you mean few people around the world using Bitcoin as a computer science experiment then yeah.

Why do the transaction fees have to be so high? I mean compared to what they could be. Compare it to the cost of sending of sending a text message via whatsup or something. I know that the electricity+data fee for them is about 0.00001USD each. Is confirming really so hard that it needs to be atm over 100 times more expensive. If so why? Sending digital payments in fiat via banks sure is not even as close as bad for banks. The only reason they charge so much is to compensate for the other servises they provide.

Its a valid argument to say that its not fair, but the fact is that BTC is a very inefficient system compared to what we have now.

@_date: 2015-10-08 14:51:36
I dont know why post like these constantly get upvoted on this subreddit. I would assume you people would be savy on economy sciences, but you dont even understand the literally most simple economic concept which is supply and demand.
The supply of bitcoin is not the rate of bitcoins being mined. Its the total aumont of bitcoins in circulation. When we reach 75% it most likely only means there will be a higher supply of bitcoins, as more have been mined, which means unless the demand rises, the prices will drop.
Supply and demand are literal opposites. Demand is people wanting to buy bitcoins, supply is people wanting to sell or give away bitcoins. To decrease supply and thus to increase prices, you can lose them to the abyss of unretrivable crypto, or simply to hold. 
Meaning the opposite would be for example tipping bitcoin to other people via reddit or other social media, if they go on just to sell them for fiat afterwards. That always has and always will only ever decrease the bitcoin value as it increases supply.
Downvoted for being so obviously wrong on a subject which should be mastered on this subreddit.

There are also people intentionally losing bitcoins. As in sending bitcoin to adresses no one has the private key for.

1. Convert egyptian pounds to USD (lose money)
2. Convert USD to BTC (lose alot of money)
3. Transfer bitcoin ( pay a small transaction fee)
4. Convert BTC back to USD (lose alot of money)
OP is literally retarded. Paypal is much cheaper.

sorry typo. I ment the higher the inflation, the higher the interest rates. So obviously switzerland will have low interest rates. But unlike your post implies, this is in no way good for the borrower.

Going off topic here but why do taxis need licenses in new york and uber does not?
 Here in finland the uber service is illeagal, and police is actively asking people to report others who provide uber services. This is because being a taxi driver means you need a licenses. As in its illeagal for anyone to take payments for driving people around without a taxi license.

Everyone has equal right to one vote, and they can vote for almost anyone. People who were chosen have power. There is nothing unfair about the system.
In bitcoin economy however you only have as many "votes" as you have hashrate. That is unfair.

To gain the most clear view of a political situation, i try to read opinions from all sides of the spectrum. Honestly i tried reading this article. But after just 2minutes i started feeling so bad i had to stop in order to not throw up.
"Most women are raped on their journey." Oh i would like to get more info on that. Oh no source.
"Immigrants are a net economic benefit and boost up wages." Hmm every study i have readen about middle easterns and africans on europe has said otherwise. Lets see their source -&gt; "study made on mexicans in america."
Can someone tldr what the article has to do with bitcoin because i cant read it.

I really suggest that you stay out of Bitcoin. Decentralized currency isnt for you. And thats not just because you arent a libertarian.
And I think the problem is that you probably dont have any idea what decentralized mean. It doesnt mean that nobody owns Bitcoin. It means that everybody owns Bitcoin. So who the fuck are you to tell what Roger Ver shouldnt do with a name he owns, or if its a fraud? It also means that he can do what ever he want with HIS code. Just like I can set up a restaurant called "Bitcoin" or "dollar" and you, or any collection of people are nobody to tell me its not the "real bitcoin".
But feel free to hang around in r/bitcoin though. Long has passed since people in this community actually cared what Bitcoin can do or what reason it even has to exist. These day all the hype is about defending your favorite side in le epic crypto war.

How clueless are you? The higher the inflation, the higher the intrest rates. So ofcourse switzerland has very small rates for mortage.
 The point of why getting a mortage in a deflationary currency is bad, is because the price of the house will lower compared to the value of the currency. Extreame case for example. In inflationary currency, if you buy house for 200 000, after 10years it might be worth 400 000. Even if the high interest rates mean you havent payed much back, you would have technicly payed half of the houses worth simply by the price of the house increasing.
 Compared to deflationary currency the price of the house might drop to 100 000 over 10years. Due to low intrest rates you might have already payed half of the money back to bank, but you will still ow the the full value of the house. You are fucked then.
Like imagine you had taken a mortage with bitcoin when it was valued 1dollar each. You would own the bank 300k bitcoin. Now today when bitcoin howers at 300dollars each, how would you feel about your dept of 300k bitcoin for a house that is worth less than 1% of it?
I would imagine users of would understand the basics of economy or banking. But you do not. Clearly shows that you are not anywhere near the age of taking a mortage.

Meanwhile most people in r/bitcoin are aiming for a 100fold increase in bitcoin usage.
Also if you do not care about efficiency, forget bitcoin and start trading with gold or bottle caps.

For abouth one millioth of the cost that was used for the BTC transactions. There is no "difficulty" of blocks in fiat. There is no blockchain. There is no multiple confirmations. The information of how much fiat got transfered simply goes through the banks network.
The reason there are fees for Visa usage is because the company uses that money to fund other services. But the transaction itself is almost infinietly more efficient in fiat than in BTC.
@_date: 2015-10-12 08:21:39
Fun fact. Banks tend to give interest on your money stored, even if the value of the currency itself is decreasing.
@_date: 2016-07-23 15:37:49
You dont like the system of money going employer-&gt;bank-&gt;merchant
So instead you want the money to go to employer-&gt;bank-&gt;BTC-&gt;bank-&gt;merchant
For that fun you pay really big for the additional middleman.
Fiat does not magically turn into BTC. Your pay will still go directly to a bank account, it is just traded for BTC afterwards. And when making a purchase, you guessed it, the merchant gets the money from a bank account.

USD is the largest currency in the world by far. There is no reason to worry about smaller alt currencies like Euro, Yen or Bitcoin that only have a fraction of the market cap and nowhere near the infastructure USD has. The alt currencies might right now have some features USD does not, but we can implement them in the future. And if direct transactions of USD are too hard, you can just keep your money in a third party service like PayPal and use that for everyday transactions.
