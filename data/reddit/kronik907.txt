You are still ignoring the fact that there was heavy moderation on when started that helped push the split. The initial reason for creating was to be much less heavy handed with moderation. This just turned it into the BCH subreddit since all talk of BCH was basically banned on If had been much more tolerant of BCH talk there would not have been such a huge mass of people that left to join the echo chamber. The lack of any discussion on BCH  (even people trying to hold a middle ground between the two) allowed in was what truly created this huge divide between the two groups. The BCH crowd felt truly attacked and silenced for their opinion on the future of bitcoin which created an element of tribalism amongst their supporters and it became more about the censorship than the actual crypto. Many over at still support BCH because of that drama more than the underlying difference between the vision for BTC vs BCH.

It's a fluctuating limit based on long averages. Unless the network goes under DDoS for an entire week or weeks depending on the length of the average set, the vulnerability of having an unlimited size goes away which was the issue with an unlimited block size in the first place.
 Most agree that Satoshi didn't want to have block size limits but the DDoS vulnerability forced him to implement a limit. This would be a very nice compromise. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 19:51:35
However the DIRECT outcome of increasing the block size is more centralization. Sure Moore's law will catch up, but until then, it makes running a node much more difficult. I am not proposing anything. I am simply stating that the tile to this post is simply WRONG. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 20:04:40
And... you're right. I'm an idiot. I keep forgetting this little fact. However, it does provide the potential for more centralization if the blocks do end up filling sooner rather than later.

Ok, I will have to politely disagree. Music is not information. It is a good (like any other form of art) that is produced using expensive instruments and tools and takes up a large amount of an artists time. It should be paid for. I think companies like spotify who are able to provide music makers with an income and provide music for the low low cost of an ad every 10 mins is a much better solution than forcing musicians to work full hours and still basically be a beggar. 
I think that some software works amazingly well as open source as it furthers development for everyone. Open source is all about collaboration between all parties involved to produce the best possible software for the lowest cost for everyone involved. Music is nothing like this. Unlike programmers or software developers, Musicians never get any utility out of what they create. They create something that is exclusively for consumption. Music has no real utility like software does. 
I also think that proprietary software has its merits and is not inherently bad just because they refuse to give away their work. But that is another discussion. 
I think that it is sad that today people feel that they DESERVE to listen to ANY music that is created without having to pay for it. This is essentially telling artists that their talent and effort to produce music is worthless. It would be nice if musicians could simply give away their music and be able to live off money from their fans, but that is simply not the case.

Ok so your title is fundamentally wrong. Increasing the blocksize limit will not continue the decentralization of Bitcoin. The larger the the blocksize, the fewer people that can mine or run a full node which is the exact OPPOSITE of decentralization. 
Please stop spreading misinformation. 
At the current moment I am with you on increasing the blocksize, but your title is just plain wrong.

Why is this so outrageous to some of you people? Not only is the fee extremely minimal, but they have released their code which means you could just fork it if you really wanted to make your own wallet. People around here keep wanting free as in information AND beer. 
The devs put time and work into making this the best product they could, and in times past they have seen that very few are willing to donate to their platform. This becomes unsustainable. Software like this will die if it relies on donations to continue to be maintained.
Information should be free but the creators of that information should not become slaves of their own product.

Your definition of success is rather lacking. Open source is all about collaboration and trying to help the greater community. It is NOT about giving away software to greedy users who barely pretend to appreciate the time and energy put into those projects. 
Open source has hardly been a success to anyone who has been a major developer for any open source project. Most can earn something near the poverty line from their work but very few have ever earned anything substantial from an open source project. While the developers may be willing to give their time and resources and live at that level to produce a product for the greater good, open source projects should used and looked upon with thanks from its users, and the devs should not be so vehemently cursed when, God forbid, they actually try to earn a living with what they do. 
This project is already open source. You can go out and fork it and create your own version if you have such a huge issue with a dev trying to help pay expenses. They are literally giving you the code for free. How can you be against someone charging for their work while also providing a free copy for anyone to implement themselves. Hell they would probably help you set up your own server because they believe in the open source ideals. Yet you still complain and moan because they dont give away ALL of their time. This concept of DESERVING what open source devs do is TOXIC for the community.
TL;DR: Maybe instead of criticizing the devs for wanting to try and pay for some of their expenses, you make your own fork and do the same thing for free. There is literally nothing stopping you besides the fact that you don't want to give up your time. (surprise surprise)

Well sure, no one actually wants to have to give money to the devs, that's why they made it mandatory. If you don't want fees, build your own binary from the source. Its literally right there and they might even be willing to help you set up your own personal version. The point is that the information is free, but their expertise and continuing development are not. 
While forking your own version may not be user friendly, the devs care enough about the freedom of their code to allow you to do it. For me, that is the real definition of open source. Allowing anyone to do what they want with your code, but also providing your expertise with that code for a price.

Ok, so lets draw out your milk scenario. Lets say we have infinite milk but it is produced at a fixed rate of one bottle per hour. At the outset this new milk is only accepted by a small village of 10 people. This village has so much milk that they are bathing with it and watering their plants with it.
Now nearby villages are seeing this plentiful amount of milk and want some of this milk. As the demand grows, the supply becomes more and more limited. If this continues to try and envelop the nearby city, there will no longer be enough milk for your normal villager to simply use it in cooking because it costs so much. The milk would probably become it's own currency and stop actually being useful as a nutritious drink and cooking ingredient and simply becomes useful as a currency. 
Now let's translate this to bitcoin. If we keep the block size limited, as adoption grows, transactions themselves become more costly than most can afford. At what point do you draw the line and say that "NO, Milk is supposed to be used as a consumable product and not a currency." At what point to we say that no, bitcoin is meant to be useful and accessible for the regular citizen and not just as a platform for large corporations and rich individuals. 
I think you are totally right that this is not an urgent question and we need to push some limitations before we fully decide, however there must be a decision that is made that decides how accessible bitcoin should be. Milk might not produce the best showers but it is a legitimate use for milk. How do we decide what uses should be economically viable for most users? 
@_date: 2017-03-28 20:42:10
Yes, however it is extremely unlikely that they could hold enough to significantly push the vote one way or another. I'd honestly say a 51% attack is probably more likely since running a pool costs way less than purchasing enough bitcoin to alter a vote. 
Also, if an exchange is that invested in bitcoin, I would assume that they would be pushing for what profits them best which in the long term means more usage and more value in bitcoin in general. If you own enough bitcoin to significantly sway a vote, then you are so heavily invested that it is against your self interest to try and vote against the system becoming more valuable. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:41:05
Great! This means the market has chosen to reject BCU! If only that also meant that it thinks that Core is the only way forward. Which it does not.

The problem is that there are way more choices than BU vs Core, but they are the only two with anywhere near competent programmers, which is sad.

Do explain how the "Market" has decided anything. All I see is a divided community and a divided set of devs and two paths that are trying equally hard to push what they think is best. And all I can say as a user is its nearly impossible to tell who is winning. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 01:02:54
Again, im not talking about consensus in the usual sense of consensus of the blockchain, im talking about finding a consensus of users of how the system should move forward during political hurdles like the max block size debate. 
One entity is hardly going to go through the effort of buying up 50% of the coins just so that the network is forced to increase the blocksize limit or some other such improvement that splits the community. 
However this is also an issue with pools and miner voting. pools can harness all of their hash power to vote for something that not all of the miners in that pool agree with, or several pool owners can get together and vote for something with their combined resources. 
Overall I see pools voting with their hashpower as the more dangerous option simply because it is much less expensive to a pool owner to try to sway a vote, than it is for some entity to buy a bunch of coin. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:45:35

@_date: 2017-03-28 19:56:30
I personally see this as the ultimate check and balance to the miners so that the people who use the network can vote with their coin on what the blocksize cap should be and then miners can choose to mine blocks up to the current consensus voted on by the actual stakeholders in the network. 
Is there a reason why this idea died so quickly? 
@_date: 2017-03-28 20:48:06
Sure, but currently there is no way that any one person or entity could possibly purchase enough bitcoin to sway a vote without becoming so heavily invested that the only logical thing to do is help the system succeed, at least in the short term. I dont think even JP Morgan can justify spending $xBn just to try to tank bitcoin and lose all of it in the process. There is no reason to devalue your own investments. 
@_date: 2017-03-29 04:41:58
Huh, I think it's a vote with each transaction but then it removes the votes for any transactions that fed the current transaction. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 20:58:28
Possibly, however I don't believe any one or even group of companies could purchase enough BTC to significantly alter a proof-of-stake voting system. 
At the point they possibly could should be the point at which they literally own over half of the bitcoin on the planet, which means that they have effectively killed the network anyway. A payment system is no good if most of the tender is being hoarded by one entity. 
EDIT: Plus at that point, just dumping their coins would do more to kill the network than some sort of evil scheme to vote for larger blocksize limits....
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:50:46
I'm not sure about others but I personally think the best solution is having a PoS voting system to increase the Adjustable Blocksize Cap with miners having the option to mine blocks that are smaller than the cap. 
See this thread for details: 
Im not sure why this concept died in 2013 but out of all the proposed solutions I have heard over the past few years, this seems to be the best one IMO.

So what central authority should decide?? The devs? The miners? The nodes? But definitely not the users? 
@_date: 2017-03-29 02:04:11
The problem is that no matter what someone will complain that whoever decides on the eventual parameter value, that they wont have voted "right". 
That's the whole point. Everyone has a different definition of what the "Right" vote should be in this debate, and as far as I can tell there really isnt much of a "right" answer except that blocks will need to be bigger and they will need to be bigger soon. 
There is also the obvious case that we cant predict how fast the network will grow and how big that blocks will need to be in the future. We could give our best guess, but that basically ensures that we will have to hard fork again later in the future when the blocks are either too big or too small. 
In my mind the only way to settle this political debate is to actually let everyone vote, with a null vote meaning that you are for the status quo. This takes the decision out of the hands of the core devs, and it doesnt hand it over to a group that is only in the game for profitability of their mining system and not necessarily the network as a whole. The users who own coins have the most to gain or lose, and therefore should be handed the keys to decisions like this. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 21:13:29
At that point, why dont they just pump and dump? Why bother trying to figure out the technicalities of voting for a blocksize limit??? The fact that they would spend billions or trillions of dollars on trying to adjust the blocksize is just ludicrous. 
All they need to do to kill bitcoin with that amount of money is buy up a bunch of coins and then dump them for nothing. 
Or if you instead prefer your conspiracy of centralization, then I mean I guess they might as well just buy out most of the coins and then guess what, bitcoin is now centralized, since most of the coins are owned by billionares. Or for even cheaper, they could all throw their big pot of gold at an ASIC plant and just spin up enough mining power all at once to push a 51% attack. 
Seriously, for that much money, consensus voting is the least of my worries. 
Proof-of-stake will work great for settling things like this, and it will provide a voice to those who are most interested in making bitcoin better: The shareholders. The ones who have bought in. And yes, big companies can buy in. All the better for everyone else, because that means that they also think the system can succeed. 
So please shove off with your FUD
@_date: 2017-03-29 00:53:57


Exactly, it allows a majority to make changes. Currently we have a minority pushing changes. That minority consists of the core devs, or in BU's case the miners. 
I would rather have a controlling majority than a controlling minority. 
If you read the link I posted it clearly explains how the absence of a vote is a vote for the status quo, so the system will trend toward the current status quo. Simply failing to upgrade a node will not protect from a majority implementing a BIP or some other such upgrade, and they will then just leave you behind. So it is with PoS voting. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:39:54
except that then only the people with enough money to buy expensive mining rigs have any sort of say. 
I'm all for PoW as the best way to mine blocks. But for consensus voting I think PoW sucks and hands all the power over to one entity whose only motive is profit. PoS can allow the users and people with varying political beliefs actually choose the way forward instead of simply relying on the miners best interests to align with our own.

As someone who has held for 2+ years straight and done nothing but buy, I also cashed out at about $4300. I expect it to correct to below $3500, but I also thought that it was going to correct down to $1600 a month ago and the closest it got was $1800 for all of an hour before jumping back above $2000.
But this level of increase is clearly not sustainable, but I think the FOMO is strong since bitcoin has been in the news in the last few weeks due to the price and the successful SegWit/BCC split. 
So corrections will probably be slower than usual. Way back in 2013 in that first spike up to $1300 it took over a month for the correction back to $300, I'll probably buy back in in chunks as the price falls with what I got from selling at $4300.

Im guessing it will go below $3500 within the next week, if what we are seeing is a real correction, but I was wrong last month when I thought that correction was going to go below $1600 and all we got was a base of $1800 for like an hour before jumping back up above $2000.

I totally agree with that, however i feel like at some level you have to make a decision as to utility vs security. Yes the coins I have in coinbase aren't controlled directly by me, but it's much easier to use there if I want to use my bitcoin to buy something using bitcoin. 
Banks and fiat are just the same. Yes you can hang on to all your savings in cash, but its easier for it to get stolen and not as easy to spend when compared to a checking account with a debit card. There is a trade off to each option. 
All I'm trying to say is that you should realize that tradeoffs exist, and it's not necessarily safer to hoard cash in your walls than keep it in a bank. 
Yes having a software wallet makes you 100% in control, but it also makes you 100% liable if you accidentally fuck up.

I put half my bitcoin into ETH in mid April when it was ~$45. The split between what is now the BCC crowd and the BTC crowd was getting so vicious that I was worried the split would cause bitcoin to fail. So I diversified and bought into ETH and doubled that half of my crypto portfolio. 
Overall I'm not sure I want to stick with ETH for the long haul with that many coins. But hey, it's just more crypto I can change into bitcoin later if I want

Haven't tried the Ledger, but I have to say I love my KeepKey. I'm not really brand loyal or anything, but it works really well, it's easy to use, and from my minimal knowledge of computer security, it's security features seem really well thought out.
@_date: 2017-08-16 05:34:09
So my point was not "Keep all your bitcoin in exchanges". My point was that keeping it in an exchange is probably safer than you trying to manage the private key yourself, UNLESS you are able to justify purchasing a hardware wallet.
At the exact point where spending $100 to keep your bitcoin safe from all harm becomes reasonable to you, then go out and buy one. 
That point is going to be different for everyone. For me it was when I had about $1500 worth of bitcoin. Up until that point I had been considering the money I spent on bitcoin to be money down a drain, never to be seen again. But at around that point, I decided that I would be really pissed to see that go away. So I bought a hardware wallet, and can rest easy for the time being. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 05:58:03
If you have over $1000 in exchanges, I would consider getting a KeepKey or some other hardware wallet. 
I own a KeepKey, which is very secure as a physical device, but it also has you save a long recovery phrase which you should write down and store in a safe place in case you lose your keepkey device. If you ever do lose it, you can just buy another one and enter the recovery sentence and everything will be restored. 
Overall I'm very happy with being able to ensure that my coins are in my possession, but I have a safety net in case I'm stupid or someone steals the physical device. 
EDIT: I said $1000 because that is imo the point where I can justify spending ~$100 to protect that investment.

And having satellites helps this side chain business? I mean I guess it will cover some areas which cant get standard internet service, but Elon Musk is launching an internet satellite web and so is facebook, and you can use those internet satellites for transmitting transactions just as well as the blockstream satellites. 
I guess I just don't quite see how satellite blockchain = profit. 
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:57:20
Well its not 2011 anymore and exchanges are actually being held to a standard at this point. I won't dispute that it's better to hold the private key yourself, but it comes at a cost unless you go for a hard wallet. That's all I'm trying to say.

So I won't comment on if $500 (sorry, no Euro key on my keyboard) is a good ammount or not, that is up to you. But what I will comment on is everyone's advice to immediately pull it out of coinbase. 
Everyone is so hasty to tell everyone to "Get your coins off exchanges" which is in general a good idea, but for somone who is brand new to bitcoin, and doesn't really understand the technology much, I would say that your bitcoin is safer in the hands of coinbase than your own computer or mobile device with a wallet software installed (Unless you are a security tech who is very conscientious about preventing malware etc and even then its not the best idea). 
What I can suggest is that at a certain point you should probably invest in a hardware wallet. Some good choices are a "Ledger Nano S" or a "KeepKey" or a "Trezor" wallet (I own a KeepKey wallet). But since those wallets usually cost around $100 USD, its really only worth it if you have enough money in bitcoin to justify spending the money on the wallet. 
Personally, I decided that I needed a hardware wallet once I had about $1500 USD worth of bitcoin. At that point, I figured I would happily pay $100 to make sure that my $1500 USD (which has grown to over $4,000 since then) was securely stored and in my own possession. 
TL;DR - Your money, and bitcoin is probably safer in the hands of coinbase than on your own computer or mobile device. Coinbase offers a cold storage vault, which should be even safer than their standard bitcoin wallet. At some point, when you think its worth it, buy a hardware wallet and move it all to that. Yes coinbase is a more likely target for hacking, but they are a lot less vulnerable than your personal devices (besides hardware wallets). 
@_date: 2017-08-15 19:17:20
It does not mean less fees necessarily. It might mean faster confirms since you can now fit more transactions into a block, but currently we are not experiencing full blocks so fees should be going down from what they were a month ago. 
Overall, the main reason that we are getting faster confirms and lower fees is that the blockchain stopped getting DDOSed with large numbers of small transactions that were filling the blocks. Since that stopped, everything has moved much smoother. However with the adoption that has been happening over the last few months, I wouldn't be surprised if the actual number of legit transactions starts getting large enough in the next few months to start increasing fees again.

And a checking account isn't money. 
A custodial account is a private centralized ledger, and like a bank, the currency you put into their ledger is available to pull out at any time. 
While I'll give you points for being technically correct, your statement means nothing to someone who is just getting into bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-16 09:24:06
Because I'm a hardware wallet shill! XD
But seriously it's because I somehow misunderstood how they work. However after doing some research and learning the basics, I think it's kind of a distinction without a difference from a local software wallet. 
Online Multisig wallets make sure you have control of the keys, which is important. However, my overall takeaway from the research I did for this post is that a new user shouldn't have to deal with making sure they are storing their keys safely. 
If I told someone who doesn't know much about bitcoin or encryption or how keys work to use a Multisig wallet, they will probably end up storing their keys in a way that is just as vulnerable as a software wallet. They might actually decide to put the keys on some type of removable media, but I can't in good conscience tell a noob to use a wallet that makes them super liable for the security of their private key(s).

in 2013 it went from $1,100 down to $200. The swing is the same, just an added zero to make it comparable to today. I bought in at like 1030 and then watched everything dive. Essentially he is saying this aint shit.

Yeah, I can understand the hesitation. However, even though lastpass has my keys, most of the time the decryption of those keys is done locally with their chromium/Firefox add-ons and they simply store the encrypted passwords for me. You can use their web interface, but I have 2FA on that as well.
For me it's about the balance of convenience vs security. Overall I want to be as secure as possible, but being able to not worry about remembering my 16-32 character passwords and being able to use then on any computer/phone that has internet access is a very useful thing to have. Especially since I don't have the chance of forgetting a USB drive with keepass on it and then not being able to access something when I need it.
Overall, it's possible that lastpass may have a fault somewhere that compromises my keys and passwords, however I have seen that they take the security very seriously, and they have enough income from their products to be able to pay for a good security team. This last fact is the main reason why I happily pay them for their premium features and trust them more than other companies. 
While Lastpass is not for everyone, I will say that I think it is the only cloud password management company I would trust with my own passwords.
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:43:35
Mostly ETH and LTC.
Also, would be cool to see a recent transaction history if that's not built in already.

Depending on if you trust them, lastpass authenticator has a backup feature. They are a company I have come to trust over the last 5 years so I let them back up my codes, but I can understand if you don't trust them.
I especially like Their authenticator app because I have it set up to require a fingerprint to open the app. I like the extra layer of security on my 2FA codes

I did the same thing back during the 2013 spike. I bought in at some ridiculous price like $1300. Once the dust settled and it was like $300 a coin I was pretty discouraged, but I had a friend who gave me some great advice. "Buy on a schedule and the price flux wont matter so much."
I have coinbase set up to buy like $50 worth of bitcoin every week. And I have had that buy set up since like 2014 (With a 6 month break when I couldn't afford it). Since I set that up 3 years ago I have done some other large buys and a few sells when money got tight, but on average, I have made back what I foolishly spent back at the last bubble and am happy to just continue to buy $50 a week through whatever comes. These last few months have shown that bitcoin won't be dropping to $0 any time soon and as long as it remains relevant, it should be gaining value, and I'm happy to ride the slow train to the top. 
I'm honestly treating it like a retirement account, and recently split my BTC evenly between BTC and ETH (Luckily before the large ETH spike) and split my $50 buy into a $25 BTC buy and a $25 ETH buy. Now my savings is diversified a bit, and I doubt that both BTC and ETH will die in the next 10 years. One might, and hopefully I can cash out in that event and recover some of what I put into it, but its probably not any better than putting my money into a fund of some sort.

I see ETH as valuable simply because it has a fundamentally different purpose at its heart, whereas LTC is trying to be the same thing that BTC is trying to be. 
I am pretty sure that BTC and ETH can both be successful simultaneously because of this fundamental difference. However, I have a hard time giving LTC legitimacy because it has always been the "Bitcoin clone". It may continue to hold value and it may end up being moderately or even largely successful on its own, however I can't envision a world where bitcoin dies and litecoin survives. 
If bitcoin dies at this point, then I'm fairly certain that pretty much all other crypto currencies will die with it, because faith will have been lost in the concept. 
However, ETH is trying to be way more than just a currency and because of that, it has a chance at surviving if BTC falls. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:47:10
So I thought about LTC, but honestly I can't bring myself to invest in something that I feel is actually doomed to fail in the very long term. I don't see its purpose, other than as a bit of a test bed for BTC that isn't testnet.

@_date: 2017-05-25 23:41:11
I'm not sure about your time table. Go back and look at the bubble from 2013 and look how long it took to get back down to the actual base price. I'd guess we won't hit 1.7k for another day or two, or possibly as long as a week. However, I'm pretty confident we will see 1.5k before we see another ATH.

But for real, I wish this was where BTC was headed but as it stands, I dont see BTC getting much more useful than digital gold, unless you can convince enough of the core crowd that we should be able to handle the number of transactions that what you described would require.

Now thats some good advice. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:45:24
I guess if you were trying to make a quick buck, then Sell now while its higher than you bought in. 
But if you actually want to be a hodler and believe that bitcoin can make another 500% increase over the next 2 years, then just hang on and schedule a weekly buy for a small amount (Like $20) and just gain as much coin as you can at a rate that wont kill your bank account. We should be above 3k in the next 2 years, so dont sweat it.

Not the same guy but I also had a bit of a suggestion. 
Could you make the Volume bars have a specified time associated with their width? Currently the 30 day graph has 33 volume bars, so while I can basically see what happened, it feels weird that each bar is slightly more than 1 day's worth of volume. Similarly, the 7 day could show 12 or 6 hour segments? then the 1 day could show 1 hour segments etc... 
While I have the mic, Could you please post the values for the volume bars directly in mBTC or change them to BTC. Every time I see that the graph says 5M mBTC I have to make the conversion in my head and sometimes it makes my brain hurt. 5M mBTC is 5,000,000 mBTC or 5,000 BTC. Thats like trying to tell you that My car is exactly 5K milimeters long... Like why didn't you just use Meters? Because volumes are quite large on all these exchanges, I see no reason to keep them in mBTC except for consistency throughout the site. 
Though Maybe I just need to stop thinking in BTC and instead start making my unit mBTC... which since there has been very little adoption, makes it difficult. IDK. Im just thinking out loud at this point.

Not to call you out as a rather hard headed stuck up Ass (its not like that at all)
But you are perpetuating the problem claimed about Bitcoin. One of the major Critiques of Bitcoin is that it has no utility (inherent value). And unless people are actually SPENDING their bitcoins to BUY stuff, then the critics are right. Its the act of actually SPENDING the bitcoins for physical products that gives it any actual utility. If bitcoin has no utility, then its essentially just a virtual form of gold. Useless except for having as a security. 
If you want people to SPEND their bitcoins, then it needs to be broken down into decent usable forms. Most people are used to having their trusty $1, $10, and $100 bills. And with inflation where it is at (compared to say 70+ years ago), you hardly see any form of transaction that is under a dollar. This may be less true in other contries besides the USA but the same concept holds true. People like big round numbers. Decimals are confusing and easy to mess up. People are not used to using them in every day situations. Spending 0.00756 BTC on a burger seems strange and its hard to associate with our current form of currency.
So basically if we want more people to actually SPEND their BTC and help it become an actual usable currency, then we need to make it simple for people to use. introducing the mBit allows for people to be able to make a Quick association between BTC and their standard currency. This way they can easily tell how much something SHOULD cost etc. ALL these associations we learn at a young age and having them radically changed will make people decide to just not bother. Therefore making BTC worth a lot less than if it became a truly universal currency that was accepted by most everyone. 
So basically, You dont understand. You need to read a bit more about human psychology and how we associate money and wealth etc.

Its also easier if you work on an algorithm to do your trading for you. It ends up being quite low risk if done correctly. I have a friend who has worked on an arbitrage algorithm and has been quite successful using USD BTC LTC and some other currencies as well. 
He used to do the same thing with standard currencies and spent several years working on his algorithm there and as Bitcoin became a viable option he has switched mostly over to BTC and LTC and a few others. Apparently as of last week he has been making a decent profit off it.
