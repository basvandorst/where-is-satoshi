Banks, attempting to protect the old system, can still put a major damper on things.
The current terabuck banking system is largely dependent on friction and fees.  Once money begins leaving the physical economy in substantial amounts, the old farts will begin to hear about it for the first time.  They can use their substantial sway over governments to begin resisting.  If you doubt there is influence, you need to ask how many have gone to jail over the LIBOR manipulation or the mortgage disaster?
The government can simply ban transactions of large items by its citizens unless they're in legal domestic currency units.  Car, house, payroll, investments, medical, legal fees.  If you take that stuff away, you're left with little stuff nobody cares about and digital money is not an option.
TLDR: They can't stop you accessing BTC but they can block you doing something substantial in meatspace with it.

No need to leap to the defensive: I was mentioning zerocoin as an alternative for people who had privacy concerns, since bitcoin is not designed for that.  I made no suggestion to change btc, it's perfect as it stands imo.

Many people think state lotteries prey on the poor and ignorant.
The checkout line is full of people who buy tickets every day which they can't afford and where they don't understand the astronomical odds, yet they consider such their retirement plan and a certainty.  In reality, if they simply banked that same money, they might well become millionaires.  The state is basically taxing the poor by exploiting the same psychological flaw that keeps them poor.
Rich people might play for entertainment, but their real income is from investing.

Buy again at 300 and you'll have dollar cost averaging of ~$450!

Setting aside the company and its methods, I think their value proposition is valid if presented honestly: wallet-as-a-service isn't for everyone but for some users it might be useful as a convenience.
Maybe there's a business opportunity for a fourth party here: independently audit, verify, and insure deposits to WAAS providers.

Good distinction. Thanks for the writeup.

Please address the goldcakes question.  I would like to know also.  Thank you.

Good point. Like the brown M&amp;M test.

Now might be a good time to mention [zerocoin]( bitcoin with privacy.

You could put a wallet on these and mass produce them to hand out like gift cards.

Guessing here that they're passing on some risk they incur, which is why it's higher in different countries where fraud laws are different.

This would actually be the second micro-country recently claimed by an individual, and also espousing digital freedom.  The first would be [Sealand]( basically a guy that took over an abandoned coastal defense platform off the coast of Britain and called it country.  They hosted a few servers there at havenco.com, which appears to have gone offline years ago.
edit: nice summary from 2102 -

The concern here is that the TLAs intercept these things so they can tie keys to people.  They don't need your btc when they have unlimited tax funds already.
@_date: 2015-02-09 12:10:49
Forced meaning, they're missing tax revenue.  Nothing a government hates more than knowning there are people who are making taxable income and not paying taxes.  That's how they got Capone, remember.

While it's clear the banking industry has cause for concern here--and that means their purchased politicians must also--what's less clear is plenty of other industries have something to gain.  The plain old military/industrial complex, for example, loves bitcoin because it's more traceable than cash.  This sector--and their purchased politicians--can simply sit back and let the change happen, driven by us coin hipsters hanging out right here.
Notice that's two different sets of interests influencing the government in opposite directions.  Maybe that fractionation of government will be a good thing.

Good stuff.  Sounds heavily NiN influenced.
BUT I was about to send a tip for the listen, went to copy and paste the btc address off the web page and discovered that can't be done for whatever reason.  You might get more tips if you fix this.
Viewing web page html, the address can be copied:  **13hrKQnNJ44PRTTysEthyvczYdNN7hj3XP** in case someone has the same issue.
Not everyone wants to use btc on mobile or QR for various reasons.
@_date: 2015-02-28 04:32:21
I believe it's plausibly either government, but not for funding reasons, simply because it introduces a more traceable alternative to cash.  The fewer fully anonymous transactions that occur, the more aware are the governments.
@_date: 2015-02-13 13:27:40
It's not related.  Half the postings on this sub are about bashing the old system.  Maybe deserved, maybe not, but it's off topic.
@_date: 2015-02-19 02:01:22
Worse now... Now I see a solid gray bar inside the black one, but nothing selectable and the btc address doesn't show at all.  Current Linux firefox.  I suspect you have some CSS misbehavior.

I meant having virtual corporations without any home country would put a serious crimp in any governement that wished to tax corporate income.  Employees and owners, on the other hand, all have to live somewhere physical, and have to pay taxes to support that country's infrastructure.  In countries with income tax, people are required to report income already.  If enough corporations go autonomous, governments would be forced to consider bitcoin wages to make up the shortfall, thus shifting attention and dependence away from corp tax.

Only half of Washington is fighting. The other half is quietly rooting for a currency more traceable than that pesky cash.

Boot a linux live cd, then there's no downside to clicking it.

Good idea. I would like to hear about your experience and perspective coming to this new.  You grew up before TV had changed the world, and while telephone was just beginning to.
@_date: 2015-02-17 01:05:28
Patently bogus article on two points. First, btc is easier to trace than cash, so this should be helpful to the good guys. Second, you can't fault infrastructure for enabling bad guys; it's there for everyone like air and water. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 17:37:18
This might force a resolution to the question of taxing individual income from owners and employees, versus taxing companies.

It should also blame Windows, the open door to malware.

I think that ruling will be finer tuned eventually.  IRS has ruled it's a commodity, so it's not totally invisible to the system. There is also a banking law about reporting transactions over $10k.
It's obviously fine to buy and sell commodities, but IRS still wants its piece of the appreciation (or you can report your loss).
