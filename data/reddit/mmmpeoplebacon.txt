Except his statement/assumption that it isn't a supply collapse is wrong.  
  
Edit: Had to stop watching after he said "Bitcoin goes from pico-payments to giga-payments for the same flat fee. That's never happened before." So many assumptions that are so wrong but the biggest issue is the flat transaction fee. Flat transaction fees are terrible and prohibit commerce when they are with in an order or two of magnitude of the value of the transaction. No one is going to pay 50% or 25% or 10% and most finance minded individuals will not pay a 1% fee for the privilege one transaction.

That's an efficient method of commerce. Pay a transaction fee or wait a week for the transaction to process... /s  
  
The guy in the video you linked to stated "For a flat transaction fee" and then proceeded to say "Bitcoin is infinitely divisible." I was pointing out that infinite divisibility is irrelevant and useless in the presence of the flat transaction fee he claimed existed. Furthermore, his assessment of the required discount for a transaction to occur in a deflationary monetary regime is flawed because it doesn't take into account that as time progresses a system like bitcoin will become increasingly more deflationary and therefore the necessary discount will continue to increase exponentially. This increasing deflationary rate will eventually lead to a deflationary spiral. In this spiral prices in bitcoin terms will continually fall to the point where it becomes worthless as a means of conducting commerce. And at the point when it becomes useless as a means for conducting commerce it will cease to have any value.  
  
  
You're obviously welcome to keep using or "investing" in bitcoin, but the truth of the matter is it doesn't matter how you use it. The bitcoin protocol is fundamentally flawed. It's biggest flaw is that I was developed by a cryptologist or computer scientist that either didn't intend it to be much more than a proof of concept; or had a flawed understanding of economics; or created it in the hopes that he could replicate the Tulip Mania of the 1600s and sell the large number of Bitcoins from the protocol's start for a massive sum of money later.

No. Notice how I didn't use any actual numbers? I did that because the numbers don't matter. It doesn't matter how divisible it is. As long as there is a transaction fee there will always be a limit to the smallest transactions conducted. If the transaction fee is 0.1 bitcoin then the effective limit on the actual transactions that will take place is ~10.0 bitcoins. If the transaction fee is 0.000000000000000000000001 bitcoins the smallest transaction that will actually take place is ~0.0000000000000000000001. It doesn't matter how small the transaction fee is so long as its a flat fee. If its a flat fee of 0.1 bit coin no transaction of 0.01 bit coins will ever take place because the transaction fee in that case represents 110% of the value of the transaction.  
  
I am aware of the argument he was attempting to make. The problem I have is not in understanding the argument. The problem is his argument is fundamentally flawed.
