Well, it's certainly not just the public key if it is the hash of it.
How would you have phrased it?
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:16:29
I tend to agree with that.

Hope to see you there

based on white paper

In 1000 years, perhaps that will be the case. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 14:42:57

The ebook in PDF is available for download for free.

Excellent choice
