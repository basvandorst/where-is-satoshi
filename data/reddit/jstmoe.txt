Privileged crybabies smash their luxury toys because shady drug buying thingy does not work anymore. Amazing publicity.

It might be good to keep in mind that target audience for an advertisement like this are people who are not bitcoin users yet. 
So that comparison picture is not entirely honest. Right side should be more like this:
1) a and b register accounts at one of the many bitcoin exchanges (and hopefully don't get goxxed)
2) both verify their accounts by sending passport photos or whatever to the exchange
3) both parties look into bitcoin wallet software and install one that hopefully is safe and secure
4) a sends money to bitcoin exchange, waits for bank transfer to go through, and buys bitcoins
5) b shares his wallet address with a
6) a sends b bitcoins from his wallet or by withdrawing from exchange
7) b receives bitcoins and sends them to the exchange
8) b sells bitcoins at the exchange and withdraws real world money. Amount has been affected by price fluctuation and possible deposit, purchase, sales and withdrawal fees on exchanges.
So there's some form filling involved here too. 
Also IMHO mocking your competition is a really bad marketing strategy. It indirectly insults their customers and makes you look like a doosh.

Finland appears to be less corrupt than many other countries, because you can't bribe low level officials like for example police officers here. That kind of stuff just does not work.
Real corruption in Finland runs much deeper than that. There's all kinds of shady deals going on constantly between high level politicians, judges and big business executives. "Good brother network" kind of stuff that really does not even get investigated, because people consider that to be the norm - the way things have always been here. Finnish democracy and transparency is mostly a facade.

I hope he's more casual this time. Last episode felt like listening to a telemarketer or some vacuum cleaner salesman.

It's fun and funny. Great reminder that Bitcoin is something that is made "by the people".  
For me the biggest turn-off of Bitcoin in the past few years has been these douchey, fake smile, $150 suit "important business people" types that have pretty much taken over the community. 
Bitcoin was cool when it was just hackers and anarchists/agorists(?), and all kinds of weird cyberpunks. Later these greedy "libertarians" came in and turned Bitcoin into a shady ponzi'esque "investment opportunity".  
Fun stuff like this advertisement reminds me that it's not all bad.

Anime is creepy. People who like that stuff fit that pedophile/potential school shooter stereotype little too well.

It's pretty good, but 5000$ for a work of some random noname artist is way overpriced.

I want a DDOS vending machine. .Onion site or something like that where you submit a domain name or IP and "insert coins", and then a botnet of 38495823945 zombie machines ping that computer to the ground.

So it's a porn site that copied name and look from a charity site, but does not give anything to charity. Classy.

Oh. That's cool. My mistake.

I'm not sure if this is the best way to spread awareness about Bitcoin. Most potential Bitcoin users who don't know about it yet (I'm thinking older, not very up-to-date kind of people) probably see this kind of "activism" as just vandalism -- nonsense made by anarchist teenagers or other troubled youth. Kids who doodle on money just aren't very credible source for financial advice.
Linux did not gain its popularity through sabotage.

It's kind of cool and rebellious. Makes your business look like you're one of the good guys, fighting against evil central banks and huge corporate giants. Down to earth but at the same time on the cutting edge of emerging technologies. 
Also accepting Bitcoin is pretty easy and it does not cost you much. It's not like some huge, risky investment.
