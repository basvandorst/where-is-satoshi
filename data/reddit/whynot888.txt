I disagree.  I almost never pay trxn fees and don't have problems (although it takes longer obviously).  
Also miners are fairly compensated just by the block reward currently (unfortunately many wallet makers / devs havent yet updated the default trxn fees to account for this).  In 10 years if bitcoin is still around, then the fees may actually be lower due to much higher transaction volume (could be 100x to 10000x).  With much higher volume, the fee per transaction could decrease while the total amount of fees increases.

Ah ok, can being the key word.  The fees are really much lower than would be charged for investing in stocks / bonds with a financial advisor.  A financial advisor typically charges you a flat fee, a percentage based on your assets, and possibly a percentage of your return (these are the fees referred to in the comic).  With bitcoin you pay a one time fee to purchase them.  Then if you are buying to invest, that is it.  You never have to pay a fee again.
If you are investing a decent mount in bitcoin, you should be fine paying a 0 miner fee (or you can just pay the 2 cents for peace of mind).  And if you live in a big city you can just go to a satoshi square and buy at market price.  Over time if more people join the exchange type fees will reduce (even though now they are much lower than investing in stocks / bonds / alternative traditional investments).
