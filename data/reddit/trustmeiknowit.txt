can I ask, what's the deal with mobile wallets? wouldnt they be way more risky than desktop ones since if you lose the phone you're in trouble?

i noticed there was a massive difference in price as well  was curious about why..
either way I cant see why you wouldn't be able to sell in GDAX instead, I've heard stories of people having troubles with the bank transfers in uk but it can be isolated cases.

why though? if there are costs associated with the operation itself of buying, wouldnt it make it less convenient than just buying in bulk?
 I can understand the strategy for a currency that fluctuates a lot but if the trend of it keeping going up continues, wouldnt you end up in a disadvantaged position?

well he offered counter points to the arguments of why it is of value and tbh they seem fair..
now my question is, is he wrong? and if he isn't, why is it of value?

that is essentially my main problem with it, what use case?
I can agree that bitcoin is the strongest crypto and the tech behind it is fantastic, the issue is that without an underlying widespread adoption (and so people's confidence and belief on it) you are bound to see 
graphs like the ones we have right now.
at its core, despite of the great features bitcoin has, any currency takes its value from the fact that people trust it for whatever reason that might be.
currently we see that trust plummeting and being reflected on the price.
unfortunately, right now, in most use cases it just doesn't offer additional advantages for your average joe compared to fiat which could be why its taking a long time to become used as a currency rather than a speculative tool.

yes but isn't that just human behaviour.. say the price start rallying tomorrow and keeps going up for a while until it hits the news again..somehow I can't see people ignoring their FOMO and abstain this time because omg bitcoin will eventually crash.

perhaps not really a currency right now, i see it as more of a stock, a currency "index" you trade against. 
its a financial tool at the moment..that's where its value is.
if one day will stabilize and be able to be used as currency then great! otherwise it'll remain another commodity to trade. 
from that point of view I don't get all the hate of "there's nothing valuable in bitcoin because its not a currency", "mah fundamentals", "its a ponzi scam" and whatnot..
what's the value in buying a random startup stock hoping it'll do well? you can't trade that stock for a burger either
