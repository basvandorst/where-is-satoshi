I always had trouble with it too. Maybe you should delete all the data it already downloaded and restart. The blockchain is pretty big but shouldn't take more than 24h to download.

If it comes to money I really doubt it that the traditional way is more efficient. You have tons of banks. Money printing machines. Lagacy systems with old cobol code. Even the police is involved preventing forgery. And so on. So sure it’s an argument but compared to traditional money we are way more efficient even with that waste of energy.

Its crazy now even normal people without technical background or even a smartphone are talking about bitcoin

Ok! To be honest I don’t understand the technical details behind iota. But a lot currencies try to solve it without proof of work. Also bitcoin with segwit a layer2 solution.

Not sure what to say. It's just speculation right now. If bitcoins become the currency with that everyone can buy a coffee then I'm with you. Else maybe something different will come. That's my opinion. But sure since btc price is 15k right now it isn't a big step to 50k if you look back to 2017.

How about IOTA? They claim that more users / transactions automatically produce a faster tx/sec rate.

nobody should know right? That's why people like bitcoin...(or let say it that way: its hard to find out if you are doing it right)
