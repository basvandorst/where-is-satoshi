Not irrevocable; time to start lobbying, as all major tech industries do.

Friendster also died because people started creating identities for communities (like fan pages on Facebook) and Friendster went to war on them. Stupid.

There's *losing* your wallet, for which secure backups are important, and then there's having your wallet *stolen*, for which having multiple wallets is important (some stored only offline).

Plus they have a house bias, especially evident on their opinion page but not isolated to it. For example, they've been talking up imminent skyrocketing interest rates for a decade as a foregone conclusion, yet they've never materialized.
(Not that interest rates will never go up, since they have no other direction left to go. But assertions of double digit rates were speculation presented as fact.)

also, you can always go to the issuing bank and get cash. I did that with my first few paychecks because wells fargo (!) wanted a 30 day hold since it was a new account. nevermind that I had just moved there and needed to buy groceries!

It's not as bad as it used to be, but liquidity is a big deal. Back in the day MtGox used to freeze outgoing funds a lot. There are more avenues than there used to be, but you could still end up needing cash.
Put differently, gains and losses in any investment are meaningless unless you can redeem them.

To be fair, English speakers learn to recognize words as whole entities; the alphabet is just a convenient way to learn new words.
And Chinese characters have component parts that you can use to recognize new words. You may not know a given character, but you recognize that it's a word relating to an animal, or a vegetable, or to people, and so on.
