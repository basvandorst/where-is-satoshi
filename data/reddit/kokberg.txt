i feel like i'd rather try to torpedo the whole currency to hurt the thieves.  but then the terrorists win, i guess.

bitcoin ponzi buried in technical detail for subterfuge. sounds like they are digging through some of the layers of bs at least.

seems very light!   if this wasn't embezzlement, it was certainly criminal negligence.  hopefully they extradite him to the USA after his 5 years in Japanese prison.

i thought that might be too good to be true. :)  they were probably pillaging the fiat to try to keep the ship afloat or pay for fancy chairs at the bitcoin coffee shop endeavor. it seems like fiat should carry more value than whatever they liquidate bitcoins for, though.

yeah i am interested to see how this shakes out. i had some fiat in my account, worth more than bitcoins that i held would sell for now. seems like fiat should be returned, insolvency should only affect bitcoin value that is returned. with the level of mismanagement there, who knows what the hell end up happening.
