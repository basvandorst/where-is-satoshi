Never said that buddy, just that calling Bitcoin "the most important,functional and revolutionary piece of finite tech mankind has ever created" is hyperbole to the nth degree.
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:25:22


It's really amazing how crazy people go about it. Jesus christ... the most important? Wow.
@_date: 2017-08-13 08:03:16
Oh, it's definitely one or the other, sure.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:44:19
It's by definition turned into a Ponzi.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:55:27
For what's it's worth from a stranger, you made far and away the best choice. Paying off debt, making a home down payment, and putting funds in solid investments isn't even comparable to hindsight speculative investing in a quasi-pyramid scheme.

Ehhhh, not really, man. Go ahead, try and withdraw $5 million. It's more complicated than that.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:43:13
Good god....
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:09:53
Don't worry, all these intellectual redditors aren't going to be tricked by any Ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:11:29
It's amazing how quickly you all go right to those personal attacks... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:49:30
That's great, and I'm happy for you. It doesn't mean that bitcoin is any closer to being a legitimate, decentralized currency though.
It's purely speculative and based on continuous investment. You did get lucky, and that's awesome.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:49:05
Didn't say a word about gold, buddy.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:50:21
Thank you for looking up that archive; that's shocking and depressing.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:50:05
In case you're not trolling:
The dollar is backed by the entire economic output and buying power of the United States, including their military force. Bitcoin is backed by the continuous investment of people speculating that it will increase in "value" simply because of their investment.
Nothing is "worth X Bitcoin;" it's "Bitcoin is worth X dollars."

To new investors.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:57:56
This is insane...
They actually think they're "millionaires" because they've bought into the largest Ponzi scheme in the world. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:48:27
And that's the issue for the "it's only at 75% of its availability."
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:32:03
A comment explaining economic theory using mainly shitty gifs should be a red flag...
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:56:59
Unfortunately, we don't know that. "Room to grow" isn't based on any measurable reality.
Bitcoin is growing because there are huge amounts of money being injected on the speculation that it will continue to grow, with no backing or regulation. The moment large investors, including foreign manipulators, calculate that they can withdraw to maximize their initial investment based on slowing growth, they will. That will trigger a cascade as others try to get out because, more so than other bubbles, this only exists because they're in it. As soon as those large players bail, this falls just as quickly as it grows.
For long-term investment or stable currency options, you don't want skyrocketing; stable, understood growth is key. This volatility can go both ways. Some people are going to become fabulously wealthy, including a small number of individuals who can cash out at the right time. Hopefully the losses can be spread out far enough to not impact the small fry.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:25:26
Yeah, what a great comparison. Soooo many regular people got rich off all that gold, right?
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:30:47


It's really sad to me that anyone saying this on the sub is met with cries of "stfu," "you don't get it," and "you're just jealous."
A decentralized currency that's purely digital is fine, but bitcoin passed that stage a loooooong time ago. It's now a speculative currency whose value is based entirely on continued investment. That is not a legitimate, stable currency. That's speculative investing.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:21:00
It is insane to think that they are comparing a sovereign debts and currency backed by the entire economic output of a country to a purely speculative cryptocurrency backed purely by investment interest.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:46:49
That's kind of what it's turned in to.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:01:52
Not even that. It's not the individual that will cause the crash. The reason bitcoin is so high is not because millions of people are using it, spreading out this growth. There are massive investors using this as a machine for short-term growth. As soon as they calculate they need to pull out, they will, plummeting price and triggering a cascade of other large players to leave.
This entire worth is held up by some very large investments. As soon as they back out, it's done. It can drop as quickly as it rose, which is terrifying.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:28:29
That's the core issue. The only reason it's "worth" this much is because of people purchasing it in speculation. The entire scheme is held up by people jumping in to invest with the promise of further growth that will come from others investing.
Investing based on growth from others investing on a purely speculative, unregulated market is... well, it's not smart. At least, it's not smart as a long-term plan. 
There are a lot of idiots on the internet, including here.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:47:08


... yes, that's the point.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:23:26


It's absolutely insane, and I'm frightened at how many kids are treating this like a miracle. The only reason bitcoin is worth this much is because people are pumping money into it to increase its worth.
It's not backed by literally anything other than pure speculation. It's fascinating, but there's no way to say, pay your bills with it. There are a lot of people worth a lot of money on the screen, but they can't actually do anything with it.
Bitcoin is speculative currently whose worth only increases because of interest in using it as an investment platform. That. Is. Not. Currency.
