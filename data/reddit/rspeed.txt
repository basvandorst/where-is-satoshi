They're both ambiguous.

All of the seeds used in agriculture, yeah. Well, the *vast majority* are.
Note: I assume you mean patented.
@_date: 2016-08-26 03:47:14
Your sources:
1. Touché. There are indeed contracts. I should have specified that I was only referring to the parts of your statement that were negative accusations.
1. Not only is your claim directly refuted in source  (you didn't read it?), *this* source refutes it as well:
  &gt; Monsanto does not restrict your ability to use glyphosate-herbicides so long as the product is specifically registered and labeled for in-crop use on the applicable crop.
  That couldn't be any more direct. You must not have noticed the part of 4-r that says "or other authorized non-selective herbicide".
1. This is a cleverly constructed story describing a hypothetical situation that has never occurred. A seed company has no legal standing if a farmer doesn't *knowingly* re-plant patented seeds. Also, you're still exclusively associating seed patents with GMOs. Even if that story was accurate, it would apply to *any* patented seed.
    It's also important that I point out that the article you cited was written by the Center for Food Safety, which is [a notorious anti-technology organization run by the organic industry]( That conflict of interest somehow went unmentioned.
1. The article says prices were rising for all types of seeds, and not just those that were genetically modified. Even if it did, between  and  you're jumping back and forth between the cost of the license and the cost of the seeds themselves. Which do you actually mean?


What was that link to WalMart's web site supposed to show?


Yes what? You're making two completely contradictory claims:
1. Labeling GMOs would allow consumers to determine which products are grown through seed-reuse:
  &gt; Are you saying that I should not have the right as a consumer to know whether the products I purchase come from a sustainable agricultural system of seed-saving that has lasted 12,000 years
1. GMOs aren't the reason that farmers don't reuse seeds:
  In response to your claim, I pointed out that "the vast majority of non-GMO crops aren't grown using seed saving". In response, you made a completely nonsensical accusation that I'd said "since most do it all should do it, and those that do not comply should be sued" (seriously, what the fuck?). My response was that you were "blaming GMOs for something that was already the case". Specifically, that only GMOs were grown without seed-reuse. And then…
  &gt; I am not blaming GMO's for anything, just saying I think as a consumer I should be allowed to know whether I am buying them for both economic, health, and ethical reasons.
You specifically pointed to GMOs as the sole reason farmers don't save seeds, then claimed you had not.


The fact that I debunked the question's premise should have made it obvious that the answer is "no". At no point did I intend to imply that you shouldn't have the right as a consumer to have access to a piece of information that accurately conveys whether a product did or did not involve the use of seed-saving, as no such piece of information had been proposed.


Rather than continue an argument over the meaning of words, I'll instead repeat my question using your word of choice: How do stock prices demonstrate your claim that the system of seed patenting is in decline? There is no direct connection between the two that I know of.


Yikes, sorry, that's my fault. I think I got distracted while rephrasing the first sentence. In fact, despite your argument being a complete mess, it doesn't even matter. Let's try again…


Have you forgotten that your argument is that GMO labels would allow consumers to know if a product contains patented ingredients? In an attempt to counter my point about patents on non-GMO seeds, you're pointing to a paragraph *that talks about the effects of patents on hybrids*.


Seriously, cut it out. I can *still* see what was actually said, and you're blatantly misrepresenting it.






And if you're still not satisfied by the other source, here's [a separate one]( that specifically deals with organic seeds:


What else is left?


By buying the food labeled as GMO-free.
I just noticed I forgot to address your earlier reference to Bowman v. Monsanto. My question regarding increasing prices and suing over seed reuse was "Why wouldn't the farmer simply buy different seeds?" The court case you cited had nothing to do with increased seed prices or some inability to purchase other seeds. Bowman's situation had no resemblance to the situation you described.
Feel free to move the goalposts again.
@_date: 2016-08-27 02:15:41


There is no basis for the government to enforce food labeling based on concerns which aren't supported by conclusive evidence. There *is* a basis to enforce labels for health concerns which are supported by conclusive evidence, but no such evidence exists. Even ignoring the existence of a legal basis, labeling GMOs wouldn't inform consumers whether or not they'd be supporting your stated economical and ethical concerns, as those concerns are not in any way exclusive to GMOs. You haven't demonstrated any concern that supports labeling.


I disagree that the health concern is at all legitimate, and I disagree that the economic and ethical concerns are in any way unique to GMOs. Meanwhile, I have demonstrated that the organic industry successfully convinced you to believe something about GMOs that isn't true.


Yes, I am. As did two of the sources you provided.


Just one? Okay. [AgriSolutions Cornerstone Plus](
By the way, what you're doing here is called [moving the goalposts]( Rather than acknowledging that you were incorrect, you're instead demanding additional evidence based on new criteria. I can't wait to see what's next.


Farmers don't even need to acquire a list, they can just check the label (or just ask their supplier). But since you want a list, [here's some search results of a herbicide label database]( I've gone through all of the labels from the first two pages (of ten), and a bit more than 3/4 of the herbicides aren't from Monsanto. Seems pretty long to me. Feel free to check for yourself.


[You just debunked your own claim](


Exactly what I said. It has never happened.
On a side note, if you're at all concerned about the accuracy of what you learn, it's probably not a good idea to rely on anything that comes from a state-run news site.


You didn't answer the question. How does the link you provided relate to that?


Then why even mention it in a discussion about GMO labels?


You should go look at my last comment, because I absolutely did answer that question. But in the interest of making my answer to a nonsense question completely clear: No, that isn't what I was saying, and I wasn't talking about that in any way.


As I have repeatedly pointed out and have supported with two different sources – that is *also* the case for non-GMO farmers. As such, GMO labeling will not allow consumers to know whether or not a farmer producing its ingredients had to sign a contract preventing seed saving. So if you *weren't* claiming that GMOs are the reason farmers don't commonly practice seed-saving, how is it relevant to a discussion about GMO labeling?


This is getting fun! That's now your *third* blatant lie about past statements that can easily be disproven by looking at the comments. Your [exact words]( were "a new system of seed-patenting which has lasted ~20 years and is already in decline".
So again, how does the stock price of those companies demonstrate that?


Are you saying "which point of mine does this source refute?" wasn't a rhetorical question? You literally talk about it in the very next sentence. But hey, not only will I answer the question, I'll even walk you through the context.
You (misquoting me):






The source supports my claim about non-GMO crops being patented. That, in turn, refutes your claim that GMO labeling would allow consumers to know if a product contains ingredients that came from patented crops.
I realize we never really got to finish discussing the second paragraph, so feel free to bring it up again.


Was I not clear? It's a rhetorical question intended to point out the stupidity of creating lies that are easily disproven.


What edits would those be? Of the comments in question ([1]( [2]( [3]( [4]( none have been edited.


It also isn't required for orange juice to have a label stating whether it contains pulp, yet you'll have no difficulty finding pulp-free OJ. It's common to label a GMO-free product because a certain subset of people will be more likely to buy it. Why would they not? I bet if you checked the food in your home you'll probably find a few with labeled as [USDA Organic]( or [Non-GMO Project]( The hummus I was just eating has both!


Cute. Are you going to respond to the part about the court case?
@_date: 2016-08-23 19:10:06
Wouldn't "harvested on a Tuesday" also be a correct label?
@_date: 2016-08-25 02:31:49


Dude, cut it out. No part of that is *at all* true. No farmer would ever sign that contract, especially if it allowed price hikes.


I'm not following your point. Do you believe companies stop manufacturing a product when a patent expires?


Do you not realize I can still see your prior comments? In regards to the usefulness of GMO labeling, you said: "Are you saying that I should not have the right as a consumer to know whether the products I purchase come from a sustainable agricultural system of seed-saving that has lasted 12,000 years". You were *absolutely* blaming GMOs for farmers no longer saving seeds.


Are those not synonyms? Regardless, you said "a new system of seed-patenting which has lasted ~20 years and is already in decline". The share price of a company does not at all represent the success or failure of related patents, ignoring that the system is actually far older than that.


That argument makes absolutely no sense. You took information about how hybrid varieties to support a conclusion about patents. There is no corrolation between those two. There are patented varieties of every crop regardless of whether or not that variety is a hybrid.
In fact, it's odd that you would make that mistake when the article says "F1 hybrids were only added to the list of patentable plants in 1994."


Both of them already can make that choice without requiring labels.
@_date: 2016-08-24 22:05:15


You consider that to be a bad economic policy?


If you're referring to RoundUp (glyphosate), that patent expired years ago.


Has that ever happened? Why wouldn't the farmer simply buy different seeds?


Again, seed reuse was uncommon prior to the introduction of GMOs. Knowing if one of the ingredients came fro transgenic seeds won't tell you if this is the case.


The patents are on the parts of the genome which were changed. In other words, the part they did create. The same is true of patents on non-GMO varieties.


They *can* do that by buying heirloom seeds.


That isn't what I was saying. You were blaming GMOs for something that was already the case.


That indicates that they're failing?


You hadn't asked for a source until now. I did. Your refusal is nonsense. But since you asked, [here is a source](
@_date: 2016-08-23 23:34:59


I'm saying that knowing if it's a GMO doesn't tell you what you claim it does.


Again, the vast majority of non-GMO crops aren't grown using seed saving. Hybrids lose their potency if the seeds are reused.

You and the common myths wiki page have made two distinct errors.
Your error is that quantum computers are poor at breaking the type of encryption used by Bitcoin. ECDSA is based on prime factoring of large integers, which is right up the alley of QCs. A sufficiently advanced quantum computer could find the private key of a public key in a reasonable amount of time using [Shor's algorithm](
The common myths is technically incorrect about the existence of quantum computers. While the D-Wave isn't a general purpose QC, there have been experimental quantum computers successfully running Shor's algorithm for more than a decade. The catch in this is that they're *extremely* limited, with 21 being the current record for the largest integer factored. Considering how easily that can be solved in your head, it's clearly still an extremely primitive technology.
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:09:30

Okay… apparently I'm not dumbing this down enough for you.
If you paid 10 uBTC for something last week, then returned it today they'd give you 10 uBTC back (or whatever the current equivalent is based on the USD exchange rate changes). If there was a 0.1 uBTC fee on each transaction, that means the *seller* is eating 0.2 uBTC.

For the sake of argument, if someone managed to build a functioning quantum computer with a sufficient number of qbits and processing speed, they could potentially churn through blocks at a constant rate regardless of the difficulty.

I am quite upset about the order and scaling of the rockets in that header image. Falcon Heavy is not that large, and the order of the last four rockets should be Saturn V, Space Shuttle, Ariane 5, Falcon Heavy.
Also, there's something weird going on with the shape of the interstage between the S-II and S-IVB stages.
Edit: Wait, shit. The R-7 (Sputnik) should also be moved one space to the left, since it came before Mercury-Redstone.
Literally the only ones that are in the right order are V-2 (hard to get wrong) and Soyuz.
Edit 2: FUCK! Saturn V comes before Soyuz! This is awful.

Edit: I got a refund from a PayPal transaction about a year ago. I got an email about it which stated "The refund will go to your PayPal account."
@_date: 2015-08-12 04:01:09
That's not really how PayPal works. It's a separate account that can pull funds from other sources. I have no doubt the emails stated the refund would be going back into your PayPal account.

A far better idea for  is to simply not use email for internal communications. GPG and s/mime are secure when used properly, but it's *way* too easy to fuck up. Saying "don't do anything unless there's a signature" is still placing an individual's judgment as a breakable link in the chain.

Lower processing fees and no chargebacks. I doubt it adds up to 20% (or even 10%), but it could be a an initial period as a loss-leader to encourage its adoption, and to attract new customers.
@_date: 2015-11-07 16:40:48
It was created by Sveriges Riksbank and they just went along with it. More importantly, they don't call it a Nobel Prize. When talking about them as a whole they say something like "the Nobel Prizes and the Economic Sciences prize".

We're still quite far from building a computer that could actually solve the math behind Bitcoin's encryption in [polynomial time]( As of last year quantum computers have been able to factor numbers as large as (brace yourself) 21. It's going to require either a massive breakthrough or a very long time to reach something that threatens encryption.

Exactly. Coinbase doesn't guarantee that the transactions go through. It sounds like they have a safeguard in place that prevents trades from occurring during times of rapid fluctuation that would cause them to lose money.

That's exactly what Apple's argument was. If Adobe had developed a Flash plugin with the performance necessary for a mobile device they would have shipped it. Instead, Adobe wanted Apple to agree to ship whatever they offered. Judging by the performance of the Android plugin, what they offered would have been complete shit. What use would supporting Flash be if the vast majority of Flash content would be unusable? *Especially* if that support comes at the expense of everything else?

How did that prove you right? Identifying double-spending is cheap, easy, and well-understood. There's no need at all to wait for a small transaction to settle. And since there's no possibility of chargeback, the risk is actually lower.

This hits a couple of my pet UI peeves:
1. Please don't design OS X apps to look and act like an iPad app.*
2. Mystery meat navigation is bad. There's plenty of space to label those buttons.
While you're at it, why not just use the OS X toolbar? Then people can customize it to their heart's content (such as the apps they actually use) and you won't have to maintain all that wheel-reinventing code.
^(*This is a good rule in general. Make software fit the platform its running on.)
Edit: I realized that sounded mean, which wasn't my intent. So I'll give you some positive feedback as well. That icon is pretty fuckin' badass. It does exactly what an icon should do: Clearly distinguish the app, hint at its purpose, and look cool.

You're describing escrow, which is exactly how PayPal works. When you pay with a credit card, they withdraw the money from your account and hold on to it for a certain period. So if you were paying with BTC it would be the same, except that you'd be sending the amount to a wallet generated by PayPal.
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:28:45
I realize this is already answered, but it could probably use some more explaining.
It's a form of [escrow]( Paypal operates on a very similar design in that you can send money to a person's email address even if they don't have a PayPal account. The money is transferred to PayPal immediately and they hold on to it until the recipient signs up and withdraws it.

Putting apps up there is a pretty good idea, actually. I'd be concerned about it quickly becoming much too wide, however. There's nothing wrong with having a grid view (like the current setup, not to mention System Preferences) under a toolbar button. You could always do the best of both worlds by allowing users to add apps to the toolbar, but only have the button that opens the apps view in there by default.

It's safe to assume someone isn't pulling a double-spending scam to get a free cup of coffee. For larger purchases you can pay a transaction fee and make sure it'll settle in the next block. You can spend those 10 minutes appreciating the money you saved.
