No. It'll need to redownload the entire blockchain if you change the prune setting to something else AFAIK but you can use the wallet normally after pruning.

Oh wow, true! Didn't realize bluewallet allowed me to select an electrum server! Thx for the tip!

I reviewed the script first.
@_date: 2019-08-28 09:58:48
Yeah, I definitely thought the same. I downloaded and reviewed the script beforehand.
@_date: 2019-08-28 09:58:09
Yeah, definitely opened port 8333. I'm running on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. That script works like a charmed.
@_date: 2019-08-28 12:33:12
Yes. That's correct. It deletes as it verifies.

It's a VPS solely dedicated to run as a bitcoin node, so not too worried about dedicating full capacity of the disk to this purpose. I'm running it on Linux. 5GB for the OS is plenty, specially when I can easily upgrade the disk temporarily if I need to.


@_date: 2019-08-28 12:33:58
Yup. You can prune down to 550 MB.

Ordered! Man, can't wait to get it! Funny, two nights ago I was on the order page buying the mk2 and couldn't decide on the shipping option so I decided to go to sleep and complete the purchase the next day. Next day mk3 drops! Psyched to get it!
do you know if the October shipping is tentative or a hard deadline?

BTCPay Server, no doubt. DM me or reply here if you need help setting it up. I have mine running great with LN and multiple channels.

Yeah, I'm on vacation at the moment, but as soon as I get back home I'll buy a Raspberry Pi and set it up there!

CBP is horrible at it. \*AFTER\* withdrawing to an address they prompt you to add it to your "address book". There're so many wasted opportunities in exchanges' UX to teach users proper security and privacy practices...
@_date: 2019-08-28 10:06:47
Not really; you can use `prune` to avoid using too much disk space, but you'd still need to download the entire blockchain to validate each transaction.

Yes to SegWit. Haven't deployed Lightning yet.
@_date: 2019-10-09 17:14:05
Not a bad idea! Maybe next year, post-halving we'll look into it ��

I'd say no, it's not worth it to try. Even if you get super lucky and you 10x your investment in one year you would only have $600, which is hardly a life-changing profit.
I'd say there's, realistically, no passive investment you can make of $60 that is worth the trouble. Instead I'd invest those $60 in books, something with a potential ROI to be life changing. Once you make some more dough do start allocating some assets in bitcoin, until then, don't allow yourself to be distracted by other people 2xing their money.
@_date: 2019-09-10 19:05:36
Congrats! May I ask, what do you do?

"high yield savings" �������� Omg, couldn't help myself laughing at that. Interest rates have been \~0% (with negative real rates) for many many years. I forgot $10k in a savings account for about a decade in my Bank of America account and when I logged back in I had accrued a whooping &lt;$10 of interest.
Getting to your question:
1) No, it's not too late AT ALL. Buy some but realize it's a highly volatile asset, so make sure you are comfortable experiencing an 80% drop in value (in fiat terms).
2) Read the blogleheads book; asset allocation is an interesting and worthwhile topic to apply.

I take it you also get paid in btc? What do you do if you don't mind me asking?
