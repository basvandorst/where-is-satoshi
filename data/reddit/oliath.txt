Sure. I understood that part. 
To clarify I was wondering how crypto investments would help anyone avoid paying high taxes. Sounds like IRS are gearing up to go after it hard and exchanges are being asked to give details on investors.

How is this tax minimising though?
I don't disagree with your sentiment but I'm unclear on the tax part.

Ever since seeing that viral video of him having the childish tantrum..... You just know looking at that face that this is a man who still yells at his mother when he can't find stuff.

I imagine its not very easy to convince people to spend bitcoins when the price is coming tumbling down. And when its rocketing up no one is spending any of it. Bitcoin lacks any real chance of success until it can remain stable for a long period of time and people don't see it as a quick get rich scheme.
I really don't see bitcoin becoming remotely close to adoption until its shown a long consistency in its value and the chance it had at popularity in 2018 was very quickly out done by people pumping and dumping and profiteering off the whole crypto bandwagon to the point of devaluing the entire concept.
It was a fantastic concept. It still is in principal but people and their greed has pretty much made sure it will not be taken seriously by most of the public who now only really see it as a fad that failed.
Love it or hate it you can't deny that its own success was its own failing.
Interested to see if it ever truly recovers.

I thought you were gonna say Bitcoin is a Shitcoin. 
Was pleasantly surprised.

The only chocolate cake to double in value before it reaches your table.
