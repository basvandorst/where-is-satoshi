It isn't a scam lol, you can run the code and play with it on testnet
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:56:03
Lightning isn't ready yet, hold on tight 
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:59:43
You shouldn't want a account there
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:45:02
Use a service that implemented segwit and has competent staff. Where are you located?
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:20:17
Think about a word with worthless fiat, its about that
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:39:03
Its hypothetical man, dream
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:20:31
Thats on testnet, no segwit allows things like LN build on top of bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-30 12:14:20
The amount of Bitcoin is stagnant because the value of Bitcoin went 4*.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:06:48
Yeah! I want one:)
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:44:50
Exactly. Its kind hard in this space to show a project when 99.9% is a scam I know.
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:49:32
Thats weird. What browser/os are you on? Thanks for letting me know!
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:12:05
@_date: 2018-05-23 21:12:24
Have to look into that, haven't heard this before. Again thanks for letting me know bud!
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:08:25
Hahah true true
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:07:41
Thanks! Crush those blockchain dreams!
@_date: 2019-03-31 19:44:22
Just install the plug-in through the link and create a account. Thanks for playing! 35k, good job! Glad you liked it.
@_date: 2019-03-20 23:20:42
They have to be sequential, I just (few minutes ago) rolled out an update where the win chart makes that clear. Maybe you have to clear browser cache to see it. Thanks for playing! And letting me know what you think.
@_date: 2019-03-30 11:04:49
Our* damn Reddit let me edit that title :)
@_date: 2019-03-27 17:42:27
I mentioned some resources in this post: 
@_date: 2019-03-19 06:33:33
First time I hear that. Can you pm me the payment request so I can see what's wrong with it?
@_date: 2019-03-21 11:50:29
You don't have to if you set pruning on
@_date: 2019-03-30 19:27:56
Noticed that. I've contacted their devs about that. Hopefully they will add that. Players can always contact us on Twitter and with enough info we can retrieve the users session.
@_date: 2019-03-21 06:06:03
Will definitely speed up the bitcoin, lapps are popping up left and right. What are you building?
@_date: 2017-03-04 13:47:59
Run a node, there are some hardware solutions for that.
@_date: 2019-03-19 08:22:26
Thank you:) could be, we're not all of that type
@_date: 2019-03-31 08:10:40
Good luck Michel! :)
@_date: 2019-03-30 11:04:09
Good to hear! gambling too much is never a good idea, use with caution. :)
@_date: 2019-03-21 06:02:43
Winchance is 48% you probably got unlucky, thanks for playing!
@_date: 2019-03-21 06:12:36
Not true, you can calculate it yourself if you don't believe me, I can also show you the calculation if you want.
@_date: 2019-03-19 06:31:31
You could have spun 10 times with that by adjusting your bet
@_date: 2019-03-18 21:49:40
Short answer, no.
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:52:00
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:55:06
Dont think btu will be worth a fraction of wat btc will be than
@_date: 2019-03-21 09:05:33
I like to use Pierre Rochards node launcher for the development environment, it makes setting up a Bitcoin and lnd node very easy. I should include that in the resources. 
I like to build it from scratch, but you could use btcpayserver too but you will learn less and creating the basic payment functionality isnt that hard to make tbh.
Thanks for playing, appreciate it!
@_date: 2019-03-21 10:03:49
Bitcoin core and lnd
@_date: 2019-03-27 17:41:56
Good idea! lots of work though, but i like it
@_date: 2019-03-21 06:14:01
Thanks :) once you go black..
@_date: 2019-03-21 06:39:03
I would love to make something, got an idea?
@_date: 2019-03-18 22:52:42
Thank you :)
@_date: 2019-03-31 19:44:56
@_date: 2019-03-18 22:52:24
We're looking to add more options for bet amounts and  play amounts. Thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2019-03-30 16:36:18
Thanks for playing! could be a connectivity\ channel balance issue. Glad it was resolved. Thank you!
@_date: 2019-03-20 23:21:21
That's awesome :) thanks for playing! 
@_date: 2018-10-21 20:57:34
Don't get sucked in the blockchain hype, it's 99%
BS and 1% bitcoin
@_date: 2019-03-19 06:34:01
Congrats, thanks for playing!
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:25:44
It's always time to buy
@_date: 2018-06-17 18:14:52
Cool idea!
@_date: 2018-06-17 18:16:07
True Story
@_date: 2018-06-18 10:11:14
That's a fair point to make I think. When I've made it opensource I will share it here. 
Thank you sir!
@_date: 2018-06-17 21:42:21
@_date: 2018-06-17 19:12:36
Good point. Maybe I should reconsider
@_date: 2018-06-17 18:48:56
See, making it opensource doesn't add the certainty that that code is running on the server, so doing it wouldn't benefit the project or the goal of learning the technical side of bitcoin that I had.
@_date: 2018-06-17 18:43:28
I don't think making it open source would be a benefit in terms of the goal that I had, but it did cross my mind.
@_date: 2019-06-01 14:08:54
LightningNetworkStores is a really great way to explore lapps and services that accept bitcoin through the lightning network. I love it, thanks for your work OP!
@_date: 2019-02-27 21:02:20
Hey I don't force anyone to do anything. If you like a challange and want to earn some sats, try it, if you dont, dont.
@_date: 2019-02-27 20:54:46
Your right they are called reels, reels slots, or wheels, whatever, pll will know what I mean :) How do you come up with the 2-8% lol, the image I included is an example, im looking for the correct multiplier numbers.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:30:45
AND STILL NO SEGWIT SUPPORT
@_date: 2019-04-01 21:17:22
What webclient if I may ask?
@_date: 2019-04-03 18:11:43
Checkout  for a more slick version and with a higher win percentage.
@_date: 2019-04-09 19:38:03
Thanks for playing! I agree its not a game the whole world is gonna play. Main goal for creating it was to learn about the LN and how to build on it. A slot machine seemed like a fun game to make and so we did :)
@_date: 2019-04-06 17:20:50
Hi! Maybe you've been on the site before? Try clearing your browsers cache (ctrl + shift + R) on chrome.
@_date: 2019-04-09 21:09:05
Thats the thing with a custodial wallet, you have to thrust them to hold your fund, and manage your channels:) Your right on the balance thing. Setup a node on testnet with piere rochards node launcher and play around, you will learn a lot, its awesome :)
@_date: 2019-04-12 20:07:07
Yes it helps spread the word, we also donated btw.
@_date: 2019-04-09 21:02:34
Running on 8gb now + some swap memory. Well you can only spend the size of your largest channel. René Pickhardt has some great explanations on youtube if you care. 
 
"Also... any idea how many on chain transactions vs how many lightning transactions you did?"
Oof, good question, I think I opened like 10 channels, maybe a few for the onboarding and withdrawing from the node so lets say 20 total. I received 1000+ payments send like 600 with that. Quite impressive if I think about it :)
@_date: 2019-04-01 16:51:28
Thanks for letting us know, can you explain whats steps you did? cc u/bitlum 
@_date: 2017-04-29 12:07:13
@_date: 2019-04-10 10:24:03
That's awesome! Proud of that :) what wallet did you use? 
Good to hear you guys had a blast:)
Thanks for playing and for commenting!
@_date: 2019-04-10 05:14:57
Which ones? English is not our native language:)
@_date: 2019-04-10 05:19:32
It frozen? :P thanks for the feedback I guess. Depositing 3k isn't even a payment option btw..
@_date: 2019-04-01 21:13:23


@_date: 2019-04-08 05:37:46
@ u/bitlum, thoughts?
@_date: 2019-04-01 21:13:03
Talked to the guys of Bitlum, they say it could be because you using a temporary email address (they don't allow that), or because the link was opened in another in another browser or the exact link wasn't followed. 
@_date: 2019-04-09 20:47:47
Thanks for playing, did you have enough outbound capacity? Damn! well played, very nice to see the money is being used for a good cause! :)
@_date: 2019-04-01 16:51:10
Thanks for letting us know, can you explain whats steps you did? cc u/bitlum 
@_date: 2018-03-31 09:20:30
Its outdated and uses core 0.12
@_date: 2018-11-11 22:01:20
@_date: 2018-03-25 12:58:17
I need all utxo's of an address, there is no rpc call for that so a separate indexer is needed (with a rest api).
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:09:23
I HODL cus i lov wsky *burb*
@_date: 2017-09-04 22:02:07
Not impossible, just hodl
@_date: 2018-07-27 13:53:39
Got explained to you a lot bro. I'm not gonna bother
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:56:30
Nice! And remember, we all are very very early!
@_date: 2018-07-19 20:20:46
What bothers me is scammers like Vitalik...
@_date: 2018-07-27 00:19:51
"Proof-of-Skill Process: data derived from major sporting events generate coins, which are distributed to users based on the skill of predicting said sporting events." Thats by definition not trustless.
@_date: 2018-07-18 22:21:01
Hodling since 2013 after mtgox! :) Very cool pins, Like em!
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:52:01
Not trustless and has nothing to do with Bitcoin, gtfo!
@_date: 2018-07-17 23:10:51
Buy and don't sell.. EVER.
@_date: 2018-07-27 08:37:14
Def no nocoiner I'm here for Bitcoin, your shit won't work. Bitcoin does. Bye.
@_date: 2018-07-20 22:04:27
Very deluded index
@_date: 2018-07-20 22:29:46
It really never is a good time to buy shitcoins, there can (and will) only be one.
@_date: 2018-04-15 13:03:42
Indeed:) so you have 44% chance of winning and that 6% is also being used for the fee of the returning tx so the house margin is very small. 
@_date: 2018-04-15 13:40:48
the minimum is 0.001 and max 0.01, and yes it uses segwit :)
@_date: 2018-04-29 20:26:02
Not necessary true
@_date: 2018-04-15 13:07:42
Thanks! :) not to many, most of the bets are made by colleagues. I'm trying to spread the word :)
@_date: 2018-04-26 06:12:46
Its an insult to even mention bcash in the same sentence, this one in particular.
@_date: 2018-04-16 19:56:51
Good point
@_date: 2018-04-14 17:11:04
Gamble. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 17:42:56
I personally like  a lot.
The site stands on a simple question, what would be the last digit of the block hash that includes your transaction? Players guess last digit of the bitcoin block hash and bet on that to win 2x the bet amount.
Because the game is blockchain based it is 100% trans parent and provably fair.
Oh and btw, I made it :)
@_date: 2018-04-21 14:57:18
When Triumph?
@_date: 2018-04-16 07:11:09
1) not relevant
2) Its not, here is the story if that helps: 
@_date: 2019-05-21 22:28:00
You're right, can't edit title on reddit :(
@_date: 2019-05-22 05:41:49
We're thinking about open source, not sure yet though. You would like that?
@_date: 2019-05-19 21:23:55
Short answer: yes, long answer: yees
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:43:12
Very constructive.
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:54:10
Okay whatever bro
@_date: 2019-05-22 05:40:52
Thanks a lot! :)
@_date: 2019-05-22 15:19:52
No we build our own little payment service. I will let you know when we've made a decision on opensourceing.
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:44:34
Okay whatever bro
@_date: 2019-05-19 19:48:06
Looks great! The go-to place for all lapps if you ask me
@_date: 2018-12-09 22:17:52
*facepalm*
