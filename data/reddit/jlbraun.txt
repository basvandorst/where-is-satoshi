Addressing your edit:


This does not address the problem of a scammer that has an "investment" that may be a ponzi or may be real.  Escrow would not protect the buyer of a share at all.
Additionally, at least proposing a taint system whereby proceeds of scams could be tracked is something good, even without the bonding feature.
@_date: 2012-10-29 02:25:36
This is an important consideration.  I would imagine that Alice could go to the list maintainer Lester and plead her case and get herself removed from the taint list.

This is using a very abusive definition of "fiat".  If no government decrees give it value, then it is not fiat, period, full stop.  The "no intrinsic value = fiat" argument is silly.  Whatever people value as currency, is therefore currency.  If the government tells them to value it on pain of death, it is fiat.  If no government does so, it is not fiat.


Bitcoin can easily be made completely untraceable by washing (**not** mixing) especially with using common amounts and randomized timing, is open-source which has a better security record than governments, and to date has not been cracked.

This is extensively addressed in anarcho-capitalist theory.  Google "dispute resolution organization".


Democracy is simply the embodiment of the statement "If there was a fight, we are more numerous so we would win.  Therefore, you must bow to our will in order to forego a war that would kill millions."  It's stupidly primitive political technology.
Even constitutional representative democracy is simply hacks and patches on top of a primitive, outdated legacy system that everyone is afraid to throw out.
There have been multiple voluntarist political systems that worked quite well and were stable for hundreds of years.
Bitcoin empowers the individual and will inexorably move political systems towards more voluntarist/anarchist forms.

Nothing.  But they gain nothing from it other than blackmail capability "give me twice what I paid for or I'll put you on the list!", and the owner of the list can be easily contacted and the dispute arbitrated that way.


As I said above, escrow doesn't work for certain types of transactions and does nothing to help people outside of escrow transactions.  The proposed system would supplement escrow.

They would then have to prove that to all of the reputation agencies that maintained taint lists, which is unlikely.
@_date: 2012-10-28 05:11:20


Wholly and demonstrably untrue.  Under FRB, one writes a loan document payable in BTC, pays out that amount in BTC to the borrower to buy whatever, and holds the loan document representing a lien against property as an asset.  


Absolutely untrue.  FRB works just as well under a free market system with no government intervention whatsoever.  If a depositor wants their money, you simply sell the loan document and pay out to the depositor.
All assets and liabilities balance.  *No money is created.*
To say that "FRB=fraud!!!11!!one" betrays a deep ignorance of how banking actually works.  You've watched "Money as Debt" one too many times, it's wrong.

Under a taint discrimination system and a network of taint lists, a scam's ill gotten gains would be unspendable.  This is an advantage of taint discrimination registries that escrow does not possess.

@_date: 2012-10-30 01:20:33
Look at it this way - I would rather err on the side of caution.  If all that means is that only the big scammers like Pirateat40 get all their bitcoin stolen back, but small potatoes scammers go free, that's still an improvement over what we have now.
Multiple competing lists would likely mean that Pirate is on all of them - the guy is universally reviled, so if you only trusted the consensus of the list maintainers, that would probably keep you on the right side of things.
@_date: 2012-09-11 15:41:57
There is "mixing" the coins in which the coins' flow between A1 (in) and A20 (out) is through a chain of addresses A[2,3,4...19].  This is traceable.
There is "washing" whereby coins that are submitted via A1 go to another user's output B2 and their coins B1 go to your output A2.  This is untraceable unless your washing service is compromised.  
@_date: 2012-09-11 02:27:13
Of course, anyone like the OP transaction simply splitting transactions among multiple single use addresses is stupid as it's easy to trace.  What pirate is trying to do here is reduce his taint percentage such that regular exchanges will accept his BTC and exchange it for fiat.
It is trivial to implement a washing service that takes in BTC from known and compromised source A and gives you back the same amount of coins from another sources B, C, and X that have never ever received a transaction from source A or any address associated with A.  Indeed, there are several already out there.
To make it more secure and proof against timing attacks you would have the emitted coins go to multiple output accounts at random times.
You have no idea what you're talking about.
@_date: 2012-10-27 16:08:22
Not really.  
First, escrow services don't work for very small transactions.
Second, they also provide no reporting framework for transactions, big or small, that occur outside of a particular escrow company.
Third, escrow also has no capability to respond to scammers that deal with marks directly.
@_date: 2012-10-28 05:16:41
Um, no.  Banks write loans as negotiable instruments, which represent an asset.  The depositors' money is a liability.  All assets and liabilities balance and no money has been created or double-counted.
Fractional reserve banking is perfectly sustainable without government intervention and market interest rates.
@_date: 2012-10-27 22:17:07
This is perhaps the best criticism out of those offered, which mostly amount to "lolwut?"
However, taint is so easily discoverable through Bitcoin (and not so with traditional currencies) that it is inevitable that discrimination based on taint will become widespread.
As noted, Mtgox already implements some taint discrimination.
@_date: 2012-10-27 22:52:44
If the coins are not in the original bonded intake address at the time of the scam discovery, they would not be marked as such by taint list operators, so no unwitting receivers would have their coins tainted.
The equation would dictate that even a single person's contribution to a scammer address would negate the profit of several hundred contributions that were spent.
So, each input address would have to be individually generated, then spent out of that address before the scam was found out.  
ed: Therefore, the scammer would only be subject to having a single contribution plus its bond tainted at a time and could still make a profit if and only if the amount taken in was in excess of that required by a single address's bond (assuming all bonds equal, 420 people).  This is a valid criticism.
@_date: 2012-11-01 00:45:48


All assets and liabilties balance.


Incorrect.  Speculation provides a service, this service is called market liquidity.


Incorrect.  The service that banks produce is giving you access to money now rather than later.  For this service they charge interest.


Yes, it is being eaten by the bank.  If the borrower cannot repay, the asset backing the loan is taken by the bank.




If the economy grows at less than the market interest rate, banks stop lending.  They do not go out of business.  Princi**pal** plus interest is paid back either out of surplus production from the borrower or from the borrower giving up the asset.
@_date: 2012-10-27 22:17:41
I know about escrow and escrow being in the protocol already.
However, my point is that taint discrimination is inevitable.
@_date: 2012-10-27 22:32:23

@_date: 2013-11-15 17:31:12
No, not exactly.
The fact that the Bitcoin protocol allows whitelisting at all means that it's no longer a free market, it's now going to be Govcoin and Bitcoin within the US is turned into a giant control mechanism with the rest of the world sure to follow.

This is a big problem that I have been screaming about since 2010.  Yes, I've been doing this that long.
Taint discrimination is 100% inevitable, as all transactions ever are in the blockchain. Period.  The only reason that fungibility has not been destroyed so far is that people were willing to accept coin they may have been stolen.
The problem is that if you operate in the State controlled economy, the State can force you to only accept coin from State tracked addresses, thus creating a two tiered system of dirty and clean addresses.  
There is no self sustaining bitcoin economy to speak of, because we were too focused on trading tulip bulbs to one another rather than building an economy.
We know where this ends due to
Greshams law, government money backed with guns, rape,and violence beats free market money every time.  But this only applies to interactions where the State can find someone to kill.  Where there's no one physical to find and kill, bitcoin will still work.
Therefore, bitcoin will still be useful in some places even with GovThugCoin.  
One, a marketplace where no physical good changes hands ( as physical goods providers will be under GovThugCoin) like digital goods and, shall we say, "services at a distance".  (about 300-1000 yards distance, probably)
Two, international money remittance similar to the hawala system.
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:06:03
Yes, technically Bitcoin will still function with whitelist addresses.  But that also means no one will want to use it.

You won't have an option.  Blacklisting will happen at the merchant level, not the miner level.
@_date: 2013-07-07 01:18:59
Um, no.  Transferring to dollars on one end will be balanced by other people buying BTC with dollars on the other.
@_date: 2013-04-20 13:15:39
This is why bitcoin is overvalued from an investment standpoint right now.  At most, each coin can only be worth the number of coins divided by the cost of a 51% attack.  To my view, this is somewhere around $5 right now.  
(ed: And I'm fairly certain I have more BTC than you do.  To preserve my holdings, I support methods to make a 51% attack more expensive.)
From a *transactional* standpoint, it can be even lower.  To support 1% of Visa transactions, BTC only needs to be at about $0.50.
Therefore, BTC right now can only be considered as being able to support between 2-10% of Visa.

@_date: 2013-11-22 16:36:54
I agree.  I think it is critical to get as much as possible into Bitcoin now so that you can easily jump to the *real* currency instantly later.  Governments will allow jumping to Bitcoin because they can easily track and tax you in Bitcoin as it's very not anonymous.  But they won't be able to keep you there.  Once you are in Bitcoin you can jump to *any* crypto currency that actually has good privacy instantly via an exchange hosted on tor.
Bitcoin is merely the bridge that gets you to the real currency of the future.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:16:07
Imagine that a little kebab place takes your Bitcoin and sends it to their terrorist brother in law, who uses it to pay for a missile that kills some prime minister.  At that point sure as fuck they will start considering Bitcoin merchants as money transmitters.
Given that all digital currencies make everyone into a money transmitter, you should at least not be able to comply with AML laws while using it.  This is why Bitcoin is in the end a fail.

This is not a new currency, it is still Bitcoin.  All the state has to do is start requiring merchants to not take coins from certain addresses or any downstream.  Miners would still have incentive to handle transactions from the whitelist as they would still get to keep the fees and new coin.

I often tout Bitcoin as "the greenest currency there is."

You can run the entire network on solar
Deflation promotes saving and buying only what you need
@_date: 2013-11-26 14:33:53
I'm an early adopter (early 2010) and own quite a bit, but I have serious reservations about Bitcoin due to its non-anonymity, traceability, lack of fungibility, etc.
Through application of KYC and AML they can effectively implement a government blacklist, where you must register all addresses you use in order to spend at any merchant.  If you don't pay your taxes or say anything the government doesn't like, all your money cannot be spent in your country and any other country they lean on, and if you move your money from any of your registered addresses once you're on the blacklist, that is considered intent to launder and you go to jail.  Merchants cannot accept Bitcoin from any unregistered address or they go to jail.  Sure, you can lobby the government to not apply AML and KYC but given that the power is there they will use it.
They can also retroactively blacklist your money if they find out something about someone you transacted with.  If you received money from Joe six months ago, and Joe is found to be a dangerous anarcho-capitalist today, your money is retroactively blacklisted and unspendable because you might be a dangerous anarcho-capitalist given your association with Joe.  This effectively automates asset seizure.
They can also implement a whitelist, and say "Only transactions downstream of this 100000BTC wallet are spendable in the US under registered addresses.  Send anything to an unregistered address and go to jail for money laundering."
Right now I view Bitcoin as the Myspace of currencies.
I am looking forward to Zerocoin.  It should not be possible to comply with AML using a given cryptocurrency.

Some validity here.  If Amazon blacklists you, walmart will be incentivized not to.


Definitely possible and indeed likely.


Unlikely.  Once the first law regulating Bitcoin or crypto currencies in general is passed, big players in BTC are in bed with the gov to preserve their status quo.

In the vast majority of cases, using anonymous currency to pay for crimes isn't going to change much, as crimes will still be solvable/ preventable with regular police work ( interviewing people, gathering evidence).
Some crimes may be enabled so much that it becomes not worth it for people to prevent them ( drug buying), and that is good because it allows security people to focus on crimes that actually hurt people ( assassination, the aforementioned sex slaves)

@_date: 2013-10-14 19:26:49
Clarification: what the bots are doing is taking long lists of possible passwords for brain wallets,  eg "thing90", "thing91","thing92", etc, doing the SHA256 hash of them (resulting in the private key) then taking that key, generating an address,  and watching that address for any transactions.

I'm sure that you've heard some things concerning tax evasion, drugs, and money laundering with Bitcoin.
**The great thing for  the US government is that Bitcoin is perfectly, permanently, and infinitely traceable.  By bringing it under existing AML and KYC regulations ( require ID of customers, recordkeeping, and audits, collectively called "greenlisting" by bitcoiners), you can pretty much kill money laundering, eliminate tax evasion, easily invalidate money from terror groups, tax evaders, dissidents, etc.**
You're going to need help from existing private industry to work hand in glove with the government to implement compliance with IMOLIN and other control and tax mechanisms.  
I for one know there is a lot of people within the Bitcoin community that are not paying their fair share of taxes, but with adequate and simple regulation you can help curb tax evasion and terrorism using Bitcoin.  The three substantive changes are:
1.  Immediately apply AML and KYC to all businesses that want to transact in Bitcoin.  Require merchants to only accept Bitcoin from addresses that have identities of real people assigned to them.  Enforce this greenlisting using random audits.  Save the customer ID and address information in a central database.  I'm sure the NSA can help you with this.
2.  Using the information in  begin enforcement of a US bitcoin blacklist, and prohibit US merchants from transacting in Bitcoin that has transited known terrorists, drug dealers, money launderers (also called "bitcoin laundries"), and tax evaders.  Make it so these people cannot spend their Bitcoin in the US.
3.  Eliminate the statute of limitations for tax evasion.  With Bitcoin's perfect transaction ledger, it is easy to prosecute someone for tax evasion that happened 10 years ago.  You can even do it retroactively, when you find an illegal tax shelter you can walk back through the blockchain to find more evaders and blacklist their money too!
We should all be thankful that the Bitcoin Foundation has created a currency with such useful and practical surveillance tools embedded in it for governments everywhere to use to keep our citizens safe and fight tax evaders and terrorists.
@_date: 2013-11-17 16:56:23
Bitcoin is 100% traceable once transactional endpoints are identified (and govs will *require* that they be, it is inevitable).  Bitcoin enables levels of totalitarian control that governments only previously dreamed of.  It should not have been *possible* to determine the previous route of any given bitcoin, instead we get perfect recordkeeping back to infinity.  One could not have designed a more perfect currency for government surveillance and control.

Wrong.  *Exchanges are the entire market because everyone is an exchange*.  Anyone that accepts Bitcoin for any good, service, or currency can instantly zip that money to any terrorist group with an internet connection.

Zerocoin on top of Bitcoin doesn't help.  If mixing is in any way optional, fungibility is destroyed.
@_date: 2013-11-15 23:22:52
Christ man, you're not getting it.
They're going to *need* to.  Governments are going to implement taint discrimination, period.  This means that they will start flagging drug dealers and "terrorists" and saying "No business in the US can accept these coins".
At that point, people will be screaming for the Foundation to implement a client that analyzes taint.

Money demands strong fungibility.  Bitcoin has weak to zero fungibility as all transactions are public and recorded, enabling easy blacklisting and regulatory control, even more than even just transacting in USD.

Bitcoin will *never* incorporate properties of other altcoins to any significant degree, as once it gains traction there are too many users that *like* the fact that Bitcoin has no privacy and can be easily co-opted by governments.  This is why MS Word never became something like Google Documents, too many users depended on its (flawed) architecture for MS to ever change it.  Thus it will be with Bitcoin.

As bitcoin grows and statists start to use it, I fully expect statists to take over development and start to implement per-transaction taxes or account taxes.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:14:21
Lol if you think the law will protect you.
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:34:26
States love to have control and power, not just the US.  It should not have been possible to do taint analysis and whitelisting on Bitcoin, but the design allows it, so Bitcoin has become the ultimate tool for surveillance, taxation, and control.  States will  inevitably use the tracking and taint functionality to keep their citizen tax cattle caged.
Bitcoin is the Napster of digital currencies.
@_date: 2013-11-24 14:44:55
Governments love love love bitcoin due to its perfect traceability and how easily surveillance and control is with it.
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:06:58
Actually, Satoshi wasn't anti state, he was anti inflation.  Hence, Bitcoin has virtually zero features to ensure fungibility and privacy.
@_date: 2013-05-04 13:42:07
Has no one heard of bitcoin-otc?  The likelihood of getting scammed is still probably going to be lower than if you set up a bank in Panama named "Centralized Statist Bank LLC".  
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:33:51
It has fungibility, but you can easily break it.
Creating a million accounts doesn't help because the government will require taint  analysis of each and every coin, and id on every address, which is trivial to do.
@_date: 2013-11-16 14:58:42


US gov:  Accept only coins from greenlisted addresses or we kidnap you and kill your dog.
See, easy.  All they have to do is run a couple stings using the coin from Silkroad and the rest of people will fall into line out of fear.
And you won't be able to exchange tainted coins for clear ones either, as bitcoin's perfect tracking means that in order for a coin to stay "green", it would have had to transit all "green" addresses.  One "black" coin hits a registered green address, and all those coins, addresses, and transactions are blacklisted.
@_date: 2013-04-07 21:33:57
This, I think, is the key. 
As long as the primary driver is speculation, and there is no business that benefits from a stable exchange rate to need to hedge with short contracts, there is no incentive to not game the exchange rate.
Therefore, as the incentive is in place and the downside comparatively small, it should at least be considered that they **are** gaming the exchange rate.
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:46:19
The point is that you should not be *able* to build something on top of Bitcoin that implements whitelisting.
@_date: 2013-11-15 23:01:39
Yes.  And Bitcoin already has all the functionality to do this easily right now.  And people from the Bitcoin community are working hand in glove with the .gov to tell them how to best write the laws to do it.
@_date: 2013-04-03 01:40:57
The BTC market can be manipulated just as easily as the metals market.  It's no different.
@_date: 2013-05-25 12:55:32
There are already dozens of services that do this.  This is stupid.
@_date: 2013-12-13 06:22:18
TOLD YOU SO MOTHERFUCKERS.
If you take bitcoin for payment for *anything*, you are a money transmitter and must comply with all AML and KYC laws.  There is no practical difference under FINCEN regs between taking bitcoin for a minted Casascius coin and taking bitcoin for a coffee.
Next step is registered addresses and whitelisting and automated taxation.
No one listened to me concerning taint and fungibility.
Welcome to hell.
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:16:32


Disagree.  There will be people for whom Bitcoins vulnerability to AML and KYC is a benefit, and not a threat.  Therefore, for them there is incentive to keep Bitcoin from becoming anonymous.
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:48:48
This is what people don't understand.  Bitcoin is merely the first of many many many digital currencies.  It has first mover advantage but then again so did Myspace.
Want full traceability, tracking, blacklist compliance, and automated taxation to comply with white market laws?  Use ~~Govcoin~~ Bitcoin.
Want complete anonymity?  Use Zerocoin.
Want to have its quantity indexed to GDP?  Use GDPcoin.
Want to have it backed by labor hours?  Use Laborcoin.

They will work with the .gov because then the .gov will write laws that make them the monopoly providers of coin validation services, and they make a shit ton of money through government privilege.  Essentially, CoinValidation becomes the new Federal Reserve.
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:40:07
If the business exists physically, they will not want to take tainted coin as then gov will kidnap them and shoot their dog.
@_date: 2013-04-22 23:58:12
For that amount of money, use localbitcoins and fly somewhere.
@_date: 2013-04-03 01:42:15
This.  If no one creates value using Bitcoin, it's just another Internet bubble that will collapse.
The people selling shovels to gold miners will always make a lot more money than the miners ever will.
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:27:39
If that option to have 2 accounts exists, fungibility is destroyed and Bitcoin is a fail.
@_date: 2013-04-07 13:09:57


This is what I'm talking about.  They would have to buy into walls in order to make the price move though.
