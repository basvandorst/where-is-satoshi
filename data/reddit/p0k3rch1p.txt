Hopefully this can *knock out* the competition. Good luck!

Considering our dollar is absolutely shit comparing with the US dollar, yes. The one problem I have with the title is that there are quite a lot of Canadians that do indeed pay attention to Bitcoin and even some other altcoins.

Wonder what this means for their economy. ;) Although I have seen many articles featuring some country to 'receive' XXXX number of Bitcoin ATMs...

Didn't Russia just create a bill that made it to the Russian legislature? I really hope it doesn't get passed. Anyways, this is great.

This is pretty god damn interesting...
@_date: 2016-01-11 23:24:35
Well this is really great to hear! Expansion isn't bad whatsoever! =D

I expected something along the lines of this to happen not too long after it was released. 
@_date: 2016-01-11 23:19:36
Oh my god, this is gold!

Erm, not really. [This just happened.](

Yeah, I agree 100%. Mycelium is absolutely amazing and there isn't anything that comes to mind that's wrong with it. I also agree fully with your statement about how Mike's wallet is perfect for kids or new people getting into Bitcoin.

I doubt Bitcoin will get anything more than 125 to 150% *MAXIMUM*, let alone up to **700%**. How did you 'predict' this?
@_date: 2016-01-04 17:31:01
Right direction!

Seeing as how China plays a vital role in Bitcoin's economy, what could this mean for the digital currency? 
@_date: 2016-01-06 19:00:47
Yes! I cannot wait for more educational cryptocurrency courses to be implemented.
@_date: 2016-01-12 22:31:38
It was fine throughout the day for me.
@_date: 2016-01-05 02:27:53
Awesome! =D

1: There is a bill that reached the Russian legislature to ban Bitcoin.  
  
2: Russians can pay internet and phone bills with Bitcoin.

100% agreed. With all the stock markets falling down insane amounts, this actually makes sense.
