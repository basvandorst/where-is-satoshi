I asked about the Thether issue and got no replies in this sub... Check my history.

I'm not saying Bitcoin is dead. I'm holding mine. But are you cool with Mastercard and Paypal in Bitcoin? Are you ok with artificial price pumps? Because we have seen what artificial price pumps have done in the past.
And now some poor countries are buying in Bitcoins for as much as 13k. Lol. Little do they know they will have to pay 50usd fees to send 1 usd. Are you ok with that?
Really? Where's the insta, low fee, secure (no thether printing) payment method that Bitcoin offered me a few years ago?
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:36:35
Because I think this community got corrupted. You only care about price of Bitcoin going up. You don't care about usability, middle man getting in and you paying fees to fast transactions (really?), thether and market manipulation. By the silencer it seems you are all ok with that, so FUCK YOU.

It depends what business you are talking about. If you need fast transaction speeds and low fees you better think twice. Bitcoin is a storage of value, like gold is. It guess it was never meant to be used as payment method. I'm also confused about this whole drama. I used to use BTC to make purchases online but it seems I should keep my BTC as a gold kind of investment so for now I'm not spending any BTC on stores. Just holding.

no begging is a rule in this subrredit.
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:21:04
Hey I'm also just grasping that concept. I've used Bitcoins for a loooooooooong time now. Buying weed, presents, betting with friends and so on. As of lately fees are too high for that (I don't care about speed). So, people are just holding it like it's gold. And that's what I'm going to do. No more spending BTC. Now I'm looking for another coin to use as cash.

I wrote all that and forgot to say my whole point: can't the devs create an in-chain solution with lower fees?
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:29:06
I'll take a read. Thanks.

Those guys they can either sell millions or buy millions. Don't expect them to buy only. They are not your saviour.

@_date: 2017-11-15 21:32:01
he is saying don't celebrate prematurely. a lot of people learned from that mistake already.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:25:45
Google bro. Here take a vitual peanut store of value for you.

But then, we are inserting a middle man as the solution anyway. I don't understand how this is good for Bitcoin. I know you don't like to talk about Bcash, but isn't their solution better? No middle man required? Why competition if there is no need for competition at all?
