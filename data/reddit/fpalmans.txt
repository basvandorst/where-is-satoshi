I am trying to understand your point here...
With creating one's own chain, do you mean starting with another genesis block? Why would anyone do that? Especially with the all the money that's on the table? 
Right now, the three main sides, segwit, bu and vanilla, can all in a significant way compete for the hash power. It would be interesting to see who would win that battle. Because of the stakes, it seems that a single winner is actually the most likely outcome. I just wonder if larger blocks enabling people to more easily send their coins to exchanges will tank the price, or the ability to easily withdraw from exchanges increase the price... How would the investors compare the value of a token? Exclusively based on hash power or ability to transact?

I doubt the market is too worried about who's signalling what. I know that I do not care either way as i am trading. It is exciting, it is fun (though somewhat embarassing) and with some luck, we end up with three bitcoins which we can trade into the ground or up to the moon. 
One thing though is for sure, regardless of how high the fees will get, I will only ever consider on chain as having value.

It seems you bought the bulk of the coins on various exchanges. Did you use their OTC desks at all, or did you purchase through the orderbook  and why?

I have used  frequently and it always worked for me. 
However, one should note that the process does not appear to be automatic! 
In all but one instance, I have had to email support  Usually, it takes a couple of hours for him to respond with the paypal transaction and an apology. Heh, I have used it so frequently that I consider the apology superfluous as I consider sending the support email part of the process :-).
Hope that helps,

I am a user. I want a blocksize increase. I do not want segwit.  
I am normally silent. I am baffled by segwit supporters. Normally when I am baffled, I assume that there is something I do not understand... yet, after much consideration, I remain baffled...

Yep - in my experience they will work with you and as soon as you  are top tier (ie tier four iirc) they are open discuss your needs if those limits would still be insufficient.
Kraken also has dark pools and OTC, which might be interesting for larger volumes.

Where do you see that? All appears to be in order from where I stand... Did a withdrawal last night / today...

I have been trading on btc-e for years and any issues I had were always resolved. I must admit that they are an odd bunch, though they appear to behave correctly.

I do  not understand how those regulations result in policing their client's actions after they withdrew their money.

I do seem the recall account closure allegedly due to sending coins to a silk road type of service, but cannot be sure I remember correctly. I have seen this on several boards.
wrt gambling, I wonder if they report that to the authorities as well... Wouldn't there be a legal obligation to do so?

Thank you for sharing, much appreciated

Then I would much rather cash out the bitcoins and pay for my coffee in cash than use LN.
Then again, I am always distrustful of bolt-on solutions.

Hi - sorry for not answering your question. The following has always bothered me; why would anyone use lightning? And I am such an asshole that I do not even intend it as a question. I seriously do not understand why anyone in their right mind would use LN. I would rather pay the ever increasing fees than use LN.

Have the 72 hours already passed?
I my dealings with btc-e, I have always found them to come through and resolve matters equitably.
@_date: 2017-06-22 19:23:18
confirmed - when I tried several hours ago... and I tried again just now... "Sorry, there's an issue with the payment information below."  
I am assuming you get the same??  
EDIT: several hours ago, a regular fiat payment did work fine...

I did not claim that what they were doing is illegal. On the other hand, if they were not requested to track user's usage of their funds after withdrawal, they are now opening themselves up to some serious liability... I also understand that the could be policing to avoid liability by closing accounts which are associated with illegal activities, but I am not sure that is what the government would prefer in certain extreme cases. So I am somewhat puzzled by their behavior... 
Does anyone know if accounts were closed where the funds were not used for illegal activities (such as gambling, which is illegal in most of the US iirc), or activities which are possibly illegal (such as sending the funds to a silk road type account)?

I understand your challenges and frustration. My experiences with Kraken have been very positive in the past. Furthermore, having spent an extensive portion of my career in customer facing organizations (support, sales, etc), I know for a fact that, though it is natural to do so, judging an organisation based exclusively on it's support performance can lead you to draw the wrong conclusions.
