Its built on the assumption that there will be high demand for housing. 
As long as population increases that remains true. If there end up being more houses built than people who need them, then they start to lose utility.
Sure, every person will need/want a house. That doesn't mean that just because the house is built and continues to exist, it gets used.

I didn't say nobody would. The fact is people currently commit murder despite it being illegal.
My question is, why do you assume that the Government is the best and/or only way of regulating it?
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:49:47
Do you think the government is the only system by which we can regulate murderers?
And if not, is the government the *best* system for regulating murderers?
That's the question people rarely want to ask for some reason. Its easy enough to say "government does X, therefore we don't need anything else." 
The relevant question, **the reason bitcoin exists** is because someone asks "BUT CAN WE DO BETTER?"
Why do you assume government is the ideal?
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:26:04
Do you think that there would be:
A) a lot of people who would suddenly choose to start murdering
B)  no consequences to murdering someone
Just because the *government* wasn't regulating murder?
Or maybe, people don't want to be murdered and will take efforts and establish systems to prevent such an outcome?
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:46:49

 So why should we expect that the government (which is made up of people) solves these problems effectively, when the people who exist in the system couldn't solve the problem without one?
 That is to say, what makes the government the ideal solution, as opposed to any other arrangement that people could conceive of?
@_date: 2014-01-17 21:51:24
 The libertarian/anarchist position really just comes down to this argument. If people are too violent, corrupt and dishonest to be trusted when left to their own devices, it makes little sense that they can be trusted to set up a government that will somehow *not* be violent, dishonest, and corrupt.
This idea has been [restated]( by [various]( people throughout [history]( and its a pretty potent critique.
 I just want to make the point that just because we have a government and that the current system 'works,' there's no reason to think its the best system we're capable of devising. Many people would rather we move to a different, freer system, and that's what Bitcoin represents to them.

The world really needs prediction markets that aren't subject to direct government intervention.
I like to think of them as 'truth' markets. And governments have a lot to lose if people can start incentivizing honesty and can make reliable predictions outside of government's own representations.
A politician makes a promise? Truth markets can immediately determine how much people actually believe them. 
Government appears to be covering something up? Truth markets incentivize the release of pertinent information and subvert their attempts to mislead and obscure.
And if we can somehow get politicians to participate (fat chance) we can get them to truly put their money where their mouth is and stick with what they say, and pay a direct penalty if they don't.

[Hindsight bias]( is the closest I can think of.
You can't look back on events in the PAST with information you have NOW and assume you would have done something different/better. You could only use the information you HAD available to you. 
And obviously, if everyone had known bitcoin would shoot up in price back then, everyone would have bought it and the price would have shot up way earlier. And then people cashing out would have crashed it. Psychology like this is why markets behave the way they do.

This is why I am going to stubbornly save at least 1 bitcoin at all times, no matter how high the price goes (okay, if it approaches $1,000,000 I'll probably sell a bit). I really want to be one of those mythic few who holds A WHOLE BITCOIN!!!
But at that point I imagine the whole crypocurrency-space will be more saturated with a few coin options so we'll probably stabilize out with BTC being worth somewhere in the $100-$500,000 range AT MOST, so it won't be *that* impressive an achievement.
But still, my big fear is that I'll sell below 1 BTC and it'll be thereafter impossible to get back up to a whole BTC, which bugs my mild OCD.

What is the deception? If you list BCH as BCH, and any purchaser is clearly able to see that, what is the issue?

If the Segwit2x change is accepted by most users, **we may choose to rename these blockchains at a later date.**


SO THE FORK KNOWN AS "B2X" COULD HAVE BECOME "BITCOIN" AS FAR AS COINBASE WAS CONCERNED. They don't consider "BTC" as "Bitcoin" just because. Would that make Coinbase a scammer in your mind?

So thanks for wasting your time, I guess.
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:42:02


Hence the chains are referred to as BCH and BTC. That's clear to any reasonable person, do you disagree? Its good enough for the Stock market that Tesla stock is denoted "TSLA."


And "Apple" isn't a general term for all Fruits. People still manage to figure out *which type* of apples they want to purchase.
Bitcoin is also not a specific term for any of the particular forks. Neither fork 'owns' the term.
Deal with it.

And at this point there's no trademark or other IP authority that mandates a 'brand name' referring to one or the other.
People know what *they're* referring to when they ask for Bitcoin, and as long as the person selling it to them isn't intentionally deceiving them on that account, then its not fraud.
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:36:34
No it is not. The "BTC" chain doesn't have any legal entitlement to be called "Bitcoin" by the public at large or the exchanges.
As long as people are not misled as to **which chain they are using** then how can there be fraud?

And if BTC ceases to exist and BCH persists, then people will call it 'Bitcoin.'
As long as you're clear as to whether its the BCH or BTC chain you're using, the name "Bitcoin" is just a way of referring to the currency.

@_date: 2017-11-16 15:57:14


What entitles BTC to the name "Bitcoin?"
If two people agree to call BCH "Bitcoin" for purposes of their business, it is impossible for any fraud to occur. If an exchange say "BCH is Bitcoin" they're not misleading anyone as to what coins they're purchasing. They could say "LTC it Bitcoin" and it would be the same situation. The naming conventions aren't *fraudulent* as long as it is clear what chain they're purchasing on. 
You're literally wrong on this point, and I DARE you to show me a single legal precedent to back that up.

@_date: 2017-11-16 14:35:12
You're making a silly distinction between the chains as if the *name* "Bitcoin" is irretrievably tied to the BTC chain.
If the chain referred to as BTC were to be removed from existence while the chain referred to as BCH continued, people can easily continue to refer to the *chain* as the "BCH" chain for all exchange purposes, while referring to the *currency* they use as "Bitcoin" (i.e. "I'm going to pay you in Bitcoin, is that okay?" "As long as it's on the BCH chain.") Exchanges can do this too.
There are two chains, and as long as exchanges make it clear that one is the 'BCH' chain of Bitcoin and the other is the 'BTC' chain of Bitcoin and consistently refer to both as such, you can't possibly argue fraud on their part if BCH eventually becomes dominant and people consider it the """"real"""" Bitcoin.
**EDIT:** To drive this point home, [here is Coinbase's statement]( on the aborted 2x fork:


If the Segwit2x change is accepted by most users, **we may choose to rename these blockchains at a later date.**
*GASP,* "rename" the blockchain? What kind of scam is Coinbase running?


So as far as *they* were concerned, the B2X fork could have become 'Bitcoin.' Because BTC isn't entitled to that name.
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:54:32
Unlike the currency ledger itself, the 'consensus' on what to call a given chain isn't enforced by the protocol, only by the people dealing in the coins.
So in one case a hard fork from the original keeps the name, in another it doesn't, and no one person has the authority to say which should be which.
This bugs some people, who apparently want to dictate terms to other users.
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:37:45


So if Coinbase listed B2X as "Bitcoin" are they scamming people?
It seems that your position is that a competing fork has to 'kill off' BTC in order to become "Bitcoin?" Why?

But you can call both Granny Smith Apples and Red Delicious Apples an "Apple." When you say "I want an apple" as long as both sides know what type of apple that means there is no problem. This is my point. When you say "I want some Bitcoin" as long as its clear whether its BTC or BCH then there is no problem.
You're the one trying to say that apparently only one 'fork' of the apple lineage can be called 'Apples' and the other types can only be called their specific name OR ELSE ITS FRAUDDDDDDDDD.
Because the difference between BCH and BTC is not like the difference between apples and oranges, and you're silly for thinking so. A store can sell multiple types of apples, label them as 'apples' and its not fraud as long as the purchasers know what they're getting when they actually make a purchase.

@_date: 2018-02-07 14:05:00
Or just recognize the consensuses can be built by communities independent of the software's rules or preset naming 'conventions', and if everyone decides to call something "Bitcoin" or "Bitcoin Cash" or "Bcash" or whatever, then it makes little sense to make arguments that the name belongs to the software itself.
The code is what the code is, it either works or doesn't, and the name we use for it is for *our* convenience, not because it has any intrinsic connection to the software. The name is an abstracted symbol for a concept, and sometimes the symbol is altered or it begins to represent a different concept.
In my view the argument over the naming of the various forks is just obfuscating the fact that *every* 'faction' **wants the benefits that come with being recognized as 'Bitcoin,'** and so everyone will level whatever fallacious or misleading arguments they can to convince people to call their chosen fork 'Bitcoin' and maintain the consensus in their favor. In my opinion it'd be better to just let whichever software works better prove its *own* worth but absent that the people will scramble for whatever advantage they can get. 
Unless we grant some central authority the power to impose the name (which would betray the whole point of decentralization) then we should accept that the community will eventually choose the names regardless of what individual parties want, or the actual code the network runs on.
(Or maybe somebody can come up with a Blockchain-based method of codifying coin names...)

@_date: 2018-02-07 15:29:38


I mean, that's how language has worked for centuries. People eventually settle on names for things, and sometimes come up with new/different names.
If you're talking about the fact that most financial products have trademark protection enforced by a centralized authority, then yeah. But the whole purpose behind Cryptos was to do away with that.


The only reason a 'scam' like that would work is if people don't know the actual, technical differences between the techs. Which is my point.
If a person wants to buy into "The protocol that uses Segwit and has the highest Proof of Work" they want to buy into BTC.
If they just want to buy into "that Bitcoin thingy" that everyone's talking about, then the literal only reason they pick BTC over BCH is because of the name attached. 
Its the people who are buying it for the name alone that you want to buy into *your* fork over the other one. Which is fine, but their purchasing it is due to the name means the value of the name is the recognition, not the technology. BTC has the Bitcoin name attached, and people buy BTC because they recognize the name.
Do you think that BTC would have as high a price as it does if it changed the name to "Bitcoin Lightning?"


Does your site actually search the web? Do the people using it actually get the results they're looking for? Does the tech work?
Then the only real complaint seems to be that you 'stole' the name of the other search engine to gain the benefit of the name recognition.
And a point we seem to have hit is that the name "Bitcoin" doesn't belong to anyone.
People who buy Bitcoin Cash are still getting a functional digital currency, no? If their intent is to use it to transact, then what complaint is there? 
The better analogy would be if you tried to sell people Google *stock* that represents all the Capital, Technology, and Data that composes the company. 
THAT would be unethical since you're fundamentally misrepresenting what they're paying for.
Does Bitcoin Cash represent itself as the chain with the largest proof of work? Does it represent itself as the 'original' protocol? If not, then what is being misrepresented, in particular?


And there it is. Pointing out that the 'Bitcoin' name doesn't belong to anyone in particular isn't saying people should prefer one over the other.
I think *everyone's* a shill who is trying to cling to the Bitcoin name, since everyone has incentive to get more money infused in their preferred fork. Its just incentives, which is why Bitcoin works well at all.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:47:54


Why not? If the community decides they want to change which coin/fork they call Bitcoin, why does the software care at all? Its not as if the name is intrinsically programmed into the protocol and won't accept transactions if the name changes.


Who enforces this rule?
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:50:39


But isn't it confusing that they kept the name despite not being the original?
That's the claim in this thread. What entitles a fork to take the 'original' name in Ether's case but not Bitcoin's? If people want to argue BCH is NOT entitled to have the 'Bitcoin' name at all, I just want some *consistency* instead of mental gymnastics.
Why aren't we complaining about Ethereum classic causing confusion for Ethereum buyers?
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:48:11
So is Ethereum Classic causing the same problem for Ethereum?
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:38:23
So which fork is the 'true' Ethereum?
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:59:15


Or there are people who genuinely prefer the technology that uses larger blocks and they believe this better captures the intent behind Bitcoin in the first place.
Not hard to imagine this.


And people on the other side think that Bitcoin Core/Blockstream are intentionally sabotaging any attempts to raise the blocksize in favor of their proposed solution, and that the lightning network ultimately represents something that is different from Bitcoin's original intent and should have called itself "Bitcoin Lightning" or something.
The idea that people are being 'fooled' by Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin cash is basically admitting that many/most people are buying in because they recognize the name and are ignorant or agnostic as to the technology, which is to say *the value of the name is in the recognition, not because it says anything about the underlying tech.* We could have just agreed to name one fork Bitcoin Cash and the other Bitcoin Lightning, in recognition that *both* have changed from the original protocol, but since the original name is still in play people are going to fight to convince people to apply it to their preferred fork.
Which is the point I make [here]( Both factions want the name because of the recognition (and thereby money) it brings in. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:06:22


So why does it matter that BCH is a hardfork? Why argue about the underlying software at all? 
The only argument seems to be about what the fork is named by the 'community.' And whether the community gets to change its name or not.
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:57:36


Does the community retain the right to change its mind?
So basically, the 'real' Bitcoin has little to do with the code itself, so BCH being a *fork* is just irrelevant, then, other than representing an opportunity for the community to pick a winner. So we shouldn't give any thought to people who argue about the name belonging to the *software.*
Oh, and why exactly can't the 'community' decide to recognize both "Bitcoin" and "Bitcoin Cash" if they choose?

What, specifically, ties the name to the chain. 
If the program doesn't care what name is applied, then why does the name "Bitcoin" intrinsically apply to the chain?


So again, if people chose to retroactively call Bitcoin Cash "Bitcoin," it would be "Bitcoin."
Why does this seem impossible to you?


But the protocol doesn't decide what its name is, the community does.
The network does not enforce the naming convention. SO WHO DOES?

That's a complex question. We WANT Bitcoin to function as a store of value. That is people who hold onto their coins should be able to expect them to keep their value or increase their value. If you buy one bitcoin in 2017, forget it for a year, then try and 'spend' it, you'll be really pissed off to find it decreased in value by 5%, given that you could have invested in something else during that year and GAIN 5+%.
If bitcoin is NOT a safe place to store value, then its utility decreases.
At the same time, we want it to be useful for other things. We want people to spend Bitcoin on goods and services, use it to transfer funds to other people, and this ALSO requires Bitcoin to be a safe/stable store of value. People won't accept bitcoin if it might drop 10% in value out of nowhere. 
If you can't efficiently use Bitcoin to conduct actual economic exchanges, its utility decreases.
These two factors feed into one another. The bigger the bitcoin economy (the more people transacting in Bitcoin) the higher the demand for bitcoin becomes, the more the value of the protocol increases, the more its function as a store of value increases. 
This interplay means that some people will hold bitcoin and speculate that the price will keep going up, and theoretically this will, in the short term, draw more people into the currency and *hopefully* increase the value more as more people actually use it. 
But **IF** too many people are holding bitcoin for the sole purpose of cashing out at a  higher price and not enough are actually using it, then the price will tend to be inflated and this will lead to busts such as we've already seen. People who hold *with the intention of cashing out* are a problem, as they'll drive the price up artificially and then cash out suddenly when the price is too high to resist.
Long story short: the best way to use Bitcoin is to transact as much of your business as possible in Bitcoin and keep replenishing your supply as you go (so you're always 'holding' the same amount). So the mere act of hodling is not going to hurt Bitcoin, no. But when greed overtakes your faith in the currency (don't be ashamed, EVERYBODY has a price) then we see problems.

The only question of whether it'd hit 10k was whether it could stick around long enough.
5 years ago there were some threats to Bitcoin that looked legitimately dangerous. Now we're just waiting to resolve the debate on how the protocol will evolve. The protocol itself is entrenched beyond the ability of any one group to suppress it.

I'm willing to bet there will be healthy interplay between Bitcoin and other Cryptos if we reach that level of activity.
If we get to the point where it's worth $1million USD (2014) per coin, though, I doubt we'll be defining its value in USD anymore.
I also am interested/excited as to what will happen when the people who held thousands of coins from the beginning find themselves to be the equivalent of Billionaires. The BTC crowd tends to be a *bit* more radical than most.

Now I'm looking at a $500 jump in a matter of weeks and I'm just mildly surprised. This is kind of just what Bitcoin 'does' now. 
Kinda unfortunate I had to liquidate a few BTC a couple years ago to cover some expenses, but it was the right thing to do at the time. Now I'm bought back in and buckled up for a rocket ride.

You just went and responded to arguments I didn't make there. 
I don't deny that (a tiny minority of) people make money day trading. I specifically said *timing the market consistently* is impossible in the exact same sense that 'timing' a slot machine is impossible. Unless you have specific actionable information about the market's movements, then you're literally just *guessing* what it will do.
"Some people make a lot of money ~~day trading~~ playing the lottery, ergo its possible to correctly predict ~~market movements~~ lotto numbers in advance." No. Nobody without special information/access can consistently win money playing the lotto. 
You can't consistently time the market *unless* you have inside information, because if everyone has access to the same information that you have, then that information is already accounted for as soon as everyone else acts on it. You can't win unless you are **lucky** enough to be the first person to act on the info.
So without inside information, making money day trading it can *ONLY* consist of luck, not skill. There is not 'strategy' involved.
So yes, your average joe schmoe trader **CANNOT** consistently time the market, only get lucky enough to not lose money. This has been shown time and time again.

'cause he's still holding more coin than I am. Can't possibly criticize the guy who bought in before me and still believes enough in the currency to keep 1000 on hand.

I think their actual answer would be something like "the Fed does a lot of complex activities involving a lot of money and only professionals can understand the machinations and their purpose, but to the uninformed masses things may look untoward or even malicious so we don't want to cause people to get scared or angry by things they don't understand so that we can continue our very important work without worrying about an adverse public reaction."
As in, they don't think they're doing anything wrong, and in fact believe they are doing what is best for the country, and an audit might uncover things that would LOOK bad even though they're good for us, because people will misconstrue it in their ignorance.
Like the CIA keeps their activities classified because they do bad things but always for the 'greater good.'
EDIT: Just to clarify, I still think an audit of the Fed would be a good idea, but its worth noting that it would almost certainly result in a LOT of conspiracy theories arising.

I'm not sure if we can call Bitcoin 'antifragile' yet but every time there's a major upheaval it seems to emerge stronger on the other end.
Like how killing off MtGox allowed better exchanges to rise.

Nah, nobody cares if he made money on trading. Its just a horrible mentality to instill in anyone new coming into the sub.
Timing the market consistently is literally impossible without access to inside information. Anyone celebrating their luck in selling at the peak/buying at the valley as skill is part of the problem.
@_date: 2017-07-23 14:58:48
So what information, specifically, did you acquire that informs you that the market would not keep rising (or stay flat) at 2650 or keep dipping at 1980?
And if you have such a crystal ball, lets put it to the test. Tell us whether the price will be higher, lower, or about the same (w/in $50) this time tomorrow. And trade accordingly.

Just throwing some numbers out there, he could spend 10k a *day* and that would still last him over 6 years, and that is assuming he just holds it all liquid. Investment returns would power him along for a bit longer yet.
Assuming a more modest figure of $2k a day average and that gives him around 35 years. 
And he's still holding his 1000 BTC in backup. If it does hit $100k per coin this brother is SET (although by that point we hopefully ain't valuing it in dollars).
So basically unless:
A) He goes on a ridiculous spending spree with Yachts, supercars, and mansions (and only the most expensive of ~~prostitutes~~ escorts) OR
B) Both the dollar AND BTC crash to zero at the same time
He can ride this for the foreseeable future. If BTC shoots up he's got it made. If BTC crashes within 10 years he should still have enough cash saved to stay comfortable. 
It is definitely possible to burn 25 mil in a short amount of time, but if you're content to just travel and limit yourself *just a bit* then you're pretty much set.
Of course who knows what this guy's goals are. I'm just pointing out how MUCH 25 million can get you. Its a huge amount of cash. And then think of the people who are *still* sitting on 1000s of coins...

Its pretty simple.
Decreased volatility comes with wider acceptance as a currency, rather than a pure investment.
  Anyone that bought in looking to make money and nothing else was just buying tulips. They're absorbing lots of risk and they're contributing to the excess growth.
 People that buy in because they want a store of value or medium of exchange (which is what currency *is* or is supposed to be) shouldn't care so much about the day to day price, as long as there's a general upward trend. 
  Basically, anybody who thinks of Bitcoins in terms of their value in USD is an investor. They don't care about the technology or what it represents, they don't even care about it as a currency. They're worried about volatility relative to the dollar, since that's what they're trying to get.
 Anyone who thinks of Bitcoin in terms of, well, Bitcoin, and isn't planning to cash out into USD is treating it as a currency. They care about its ability to transfer money safely, cheaply, and securely, its lack of central control, its convenience, etc. These things don't go away, no matter what the USD 'price' is. 
 Basically, the volatility will go down as more and more people stop thinking of Bitcoin in terms of USD and start treating it like an actual currency. Which is happening slowly but surely. Eventually the investors will get out of the way.
@_date: 2017-07-12 20:17:22
I think he's talking about the Fed's theoretical attitude that the little people aren't smart enough to understand what they do.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:25:04
  And investors/speculators are bad for price stability. If we have fewer people investing, and more people saving/trading for goods and services the price will be more stable.
  That's a function of getting more merchants to buy and sell in bitcoin, which is a function of getting more people to realize what bitcoin *is.* 
  The bitcoin network and all that comes with that has its own value. We want the market price to reflect that value of *that* rather than whatever price its been speculated up to.
@_date: 2013-08-29 16:43:00
That's nifty. I would actually pay and use this sort of service, assuming there was a decent product behind it.

That depends on whether it gets any mainstream attention. If a major news network takes any notice, it'll definitely jump from that. 
So now its a question of whether the increase is slow and steady or fast yet volatile.
If I knew for sure how it would go, I'd be buying lots and lots of them.
@_date: 2017-06-27 23:48:35
I guess it FEELS like a major 'loss' if you were hoping/expecting it to shoot over 3000 and stay up there.

[Past performance is no indication of future results](
Either you want to take the risk or you don't. Posting unrelated graphs is literally a nonpoint.

Exactly. There's no reason to be afraid of Chinese 'dominance' of Bitcoin, since that just means they have a major incentive to uphold its value as well as everyone else who's using it does. In essence, we're all in this together. Unless it happens that all the Chinese bitcoiners simultaneously decide to screw over the rest of us (which is vastly unlikely) they can only help us, not hurt us.
In essence, you don't need to think of it as "the Chinese" ruling the economy at all. Anyone and everyone who holds bitcoin has a stake. A lot of them may be Chinese, but that doesn't give them any special advantages or authority.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:31:29

There is no argument, their performance is completely and utterly unrelated. You can't use one to predict the other.
  Which is MY point.

May I take that as a 'no' on all counts, then?
@_date: 2013-03-19 21:43:37
Which of course means the market cap rises as the value of the good rises/more of the good are produced.
 So really he's just asking why its not valued more.

I wouldn't have to if you'd answer. Lacking an answer, I'm forced to make presumptions.

Ultimately, it'll give us a decent idea on how much of bitcoin's value was based on Silk Road's existence.
I'm hoping less than 50%.

You don't see the potential benefits of a decentralized currency that can allow cheap, easy, and fast transactions without a middleman? Where a person can have as much control over their money as they want? Where literally ANY PERSON with an internet connection can transact with ANY OTHER person with an internet connection essentially for free?
 A currency that literally has no boundaries? Hey, no reason to take the risk.
But Apple wasn't much before it produced the iPod.
 *Nobody knows where this currency is going,* it could grow to be bigger than Apple, Google, and Microsoft combined, or it could flop overnight. The only question is how much you want to risk on either outcome occurring.

 If its in a brainwallet its gone when you're gone.
If you keep it so its still accessible, its just like any other asset. Specify in your will what is to be done/who it will go to. Include instructions for accessing them wherever they are. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:43:15
Its not complicated. In fact, I understand far more about Bitcoin than I do about the Federal Reserve.
  Arguably its simpler than the dollar in real terms, since you can literally transfer money at the click of a button with no intermediary and no information other than the public key of the destination wallet.
 With some more 'user-friendly' interfaces developed, there's no reason people can't use this just like the use the dollar, in spite of having no idea how either of them 'works.'
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:11:27
 And hopefully if we scare the speculators out of the market, its value will become less volatile. 
  Whats stupid, however, is people who pretend that fluctuations in the price reflect a problem with the *currency itself,* rather than how people are treating the currency as an investment.
  Its like if the price of Gold were to rapidly fluctuate. The gold itself hasn't changed. Its still sitting there looking shiny. Likewise, the Bitcoin network is still there, doing its thing. Its the people trying to speculate that are freaking out right now, not the ones who value the bitcoin/gold itself.

What's the market cap based on?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:57:36
 Only if people are only buying in to invest, in hopes of becoming rich on USD.
The underlying network, as in, what Bitcoin actually *IS,* hasn't been effected in the slightest. The network hasn't been compromised, there's been no effect on the actual transactions that make up the market, the currency is still completely sound.
 In terms of *my* confidence in the currency, its actually increased, given how the network itself has handled the activity. 
  So in some ways, if it deters people from buying bitcoins solely as an investment, that's a good thing.
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:35:10
... how would *you* format a graph to show a fluctuation lasting a few hours on a *6 month* time frame?

Initially bought in when the price was $60 (only a few weeks ago, amazingly), watched it fluctuate like crazy (complete with mini-crash around $100), then later sold half at $150, recouping initial 'investment' plus some extra. Held the rest with no intention of selling anytime soon.
Then I watched people who started up in the past week or so freaking out because they haven't been around long enough to know what they're doing. They'll either drop it forever or they'll learn.
No matter what happens, I'm already in the positives, even if the value drops to $0. I cannot lose any money at this point. 
I'm here for the long haul. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:08:56
 Some people were buying in because of fear of what happened in Cyprus. Some bought in because they were curious.
 There's no way of knowing how much of the market is savers who are buying the currency and investors that are looking to strike it rich. The price reflects a combination of both. If you care about bitcoin as a currency in its own right, day-to-day fluctuations don't mean shit, as long as there's a general upward trend. 
  If we scare investors out, the price will better reflect Bitcoin's value as a currency, rather than an investment.
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:09:33
Your trust in MtGox and other exchanges may have shaken.
If you actually knew what bitcoin *is* you'd know that the network itself hasn't been affected. At all. If your only understanding of what Bitcoin is is its relationship to the dollar, you were looking at it for the *wrong* reasons anyway.
 But I'm not here to convince you. I bought in back when it was $60 (only a few weeks, actually) and I've seen how things are turning. Bumps in the road terrify the short sighted. But not everyone is short-sighted. 
Shake your head now, and leave, if you want. Won't stop you from coming back later when its proven more resilient than you thought.
 
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:52:53
Is that the best that you can do?
How about this:
"for those of you with bottomless faith in the Dollar, why? Do yourself a favor and buy bitcoin while its still below $200."
 Of course, if you don't care about a decentralized, semi-anonymous, highly secure, easily transferable, and convenient currency WHY ARE YOU ON THIS SUBREDDIT?
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:06:00
 And as it happens, that TRUST hasn't been broken.
 The network that makes up Bitcoin hasn't been affected in the slightest. Anybody who is even SLIGHTLY familiar with what Bitcoin *is* knows that the currency itself is still perfectly sound. There's been no harm to the network, indeed it handled the mass of transactions very admirably. 
 
 If you've been around for more than a week, then you'd know that the value of bitcoin has been on a consistent rise, with plenty of fluctuations but an overall positive trend. THAT is what matters. 
 Until a fatal flaw is found in the network *itself,* anyone with a long-term view can trust the currency. The only people that lose trust are the ones who never new what they were getting into in the first place.

Even if you consider it to be 'luck,' that doesn't mean you're any less entitled to the reward.
 The whole world operates on a risk/reward system. If you are taking the risks, then of course you are entitled to the rewards that result. If people who take risks aren't allowed to reap their rewards, they lose the incentive to take the risks in the first place. This results in stagnation.
 So as long as you only put YOUR property on the line, as long as you didn't lie, cheat, or steal to get what you wanted, then who else could possibly have a higher claim to the reward?
  On the flip side, of course, if things had gone wrong, you would have suffered the consequences. So YOU stood to lose as well. Why is it wrong to enjoy the benefits of a risky choice, but fine to be made to bear the bad consequences of said choice? 
  And so Capitalism keeps on chugging.
