Well, I'm not up to date on what's the best. I'm using a rather old card from my freshman year in college. AMD R9 390 by MSI. 
There should be plenty of relevant up to date guides online. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:13:51
Quality is higher than I expected. It's worth noting. The way people talk about Bitmain sometimes I expect these to be poorly cobbled together shit heaps. Rather professional job on them IMO. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:49:28
Do you have any hardware currently?
@_date: 2018-01-03 23:21:29
That's rough. I'm optimistic that these will work well and Bitmain's reputation will become better. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 06:35:02
Honestly, I mine with my main GPU. I am not super comfortable giving advice because I don't know how much $1000 is worth to you. To me that's a fair bit of $$$. 
I would use whatever main GPU you have. Your GPU is designed to run @ load. The damage comes from throttling up and throttling down of the GPU. Mining shouldn't be a concern imo.

Wait for them to post them for sale. It goes quick but not like crazy fast. They were on the site for atleast 2-3 weeks from thanksgiving till 2nd week of December. 
Not a dumb question, because if you aren't persistently checking, then you'd think they are never for sale lol.
@_date: 2018-01-04 06:22:35
It appears that it isn't until you cash out into fiat but new tax law might be shifting towards taxation involving like kind exchanges? 
I haven't read too heavily into but I am pretty sure making alt trades and gaining in ETH/BTC can be considered a taxable event somehow.

220v out the wall in an industrial warehouse. Electrician just came in and made quick work of it. 4 miners so far. 1 more S9 comin and a L3+ coming. Going to be turn the profits right back to getting more machines.
We have been talking about undervolting. So I guess for conservative calcs we should assume each machine will only last 7 months. 
Thanks for the great info

I don't go on any subs, although I'm sure it's helpful. I occasionally browse bitcointalk.org... and usually biz for good shitposting. Other than that just hitguides online. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 06:45:51
Good luck but be careful! 
Worst case scenario, can you get an electrician to wire you a 220v and a separate breaker? Ours was able to do that
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:13:43
Because brainlet, they were both not for sale when I was looking to order miners and they were unavailable when I was ordering them. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:28:13
Directly from Bitmain. They sell quickly, but I cannot trust a 3rd party to not be reselling at a premium or installing something to the detriment of the machine. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:14:25
It's the only thing they'll take. So it's not like their was a choice to do so or not 
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:57:31
Here's my take. Traditional Finance and investment people literally don't like the idea that a bunch of NEETS on the internet are making thousands of dollars while even one of the strongest bull runs in market history can't compare to crypto gains.
Why would it make sense? Imagine being a highly skilled scientist and some dumbass in his garage outperforms your life's work just fucking around. I would be upset too.

@_date: 2018-01-04 00:19:55
We couldn't get ahold of any dragon miners, but we are definitely waiting for something to come on. We are using these machines to buy more machines. 
Had to use Bcash because it's all they will take. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:17:57

CPU mining is kind of dead tbh. Not worth it unless you've got a bleeding edge CPU that does really well
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:52:26
I would sell my hashing power imo. Don't wanna get caught mining a pumping coin and it dumps before you can sell off.

For some reason I thought so. I love my AMD gpu for mining (except VTC!)
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:54:43
We've been placing orders since thanksgiving. 
I was incredibly skeptical of Bitmain and honestly they really surprised me. They delivered ahead of schedule and it cleared customs with easy. We weren't planning on these miners arriving till mid Jan.
We are a father and son cooperative. We didn't expect them to show up and subsequently I was on the other side of the state and my brother was in Chicago. Had to do a quick return to our warehouse to get it going. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:25:34
What if I told you that buying more coin and mining is not only possible but the better option.
Not realizing that the more mining power there is in the USA is a good thing regardless of who is the MFG. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:52:53
Maybe. Either way there is money to be made
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:35:13
We expect $25-30 a day per machine. The break even is going to be about 2.5-3 months in our opinion. We use realllllly conservative estimate. We'd rather lowball and come out green than set expectations really high and miss the mark. 
Our goal is to have 50 machines in our warehouse
Worth noting I also run a Very simple GPU miner that grosses $100 a month of ETH and am holding a decent amount of alts. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:00:20
I started mining and holding in June. My brother &amp; I actually been using BTC as a transactional currency since 2014, BUT I never held onto it because I used it as it was intended.
Early 2017 I had an internship where I was working 40-70 hours a week making $25 an hour and time and a half OT. I wanted to do something with my money but I didn't believe traditional markets and investments would be the right route for me. I did not move into cryptos either. I instead said 3-6 months of strong monitoring and gaining knowledge before I make a move.
I began mining because I am a college student and I had given up on working part time jobs in my senior year of college so I could go to the gym and focus on my grades (made a 3.7 subsequently moving my gpa up to a 3.6). Making $6 a day on my R9 390 card enabled me to pay for gas weekly and groceries. Over time I began acquiring .01 of BTC for almost next to nothing now a days. I continued to accumulate and wait. I sold through peaks and accumulated off of dips. I think the main thing to know is that I was never afraid to take profits and I was never nervous about big dips. I never sold at a loss. 
So fast forward to Fall 2017, I began talking to daily and really learning the financial analysis aspect of alt coins from a PhD student at my college. Dude has literally brilliant analysis he called: COSS, ADA, Ripple, etc. all when they were worth next to nothing. It encouraged me to do my own research and reach similar conclusions. 
By fall 2017 before mania really set in, my father wanted to get in. My brother and I showed him coinbase and such. My father then wanted to go ahead sink a sizable portion of money into a mining operation. 
Now we are here. This is a crazy bull market so obviously I'm not a genius making money in places unseen. Find nice projects with strong dev teams and goals that are both reasonable while being ambitious. 
Everyone will always say that holding will beat out mining, but I always replied "why not both?".
Let me know if you have any specific Q's 
Edit: my educational background is accounting &amp; finance. I'm incredibly conservative in my investments almost to a fault haha. I wonder what life would be like if I sunk $1000 into some coins. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:28:57
Any of the 1 clicker miners have a subreddit and a website that describe it. It's quite easy honestly. Use nicehash or betterhash. Best of luck.

Because it's tethered to it. People use it to move between cryptos without going to real Fiat.

There's almost nothing to it, they can issue as they please.
Lots of concern around when momentum is slowing during a bull run of BTC, a huge amount of tether gets issued. It seems very bizarre and too much of a coincidence. The whole point of cryptos was to be within a truly free market. If there are exchange manipulation, then what is this all for?

Tether is tether to $1, there are rare inconsistencies where's it's .98-.99, but you get it.
It's a dollar whether $50M is printed or 1000 are.

These goddamn chinamen are really busting my balls. Besides the fact that everyday when it's morning time in China we get huge movements. They pull this shit.

Welcome to the suck. Don't spend what you can't lose. That's financial investments 101. The day you put that money in, you should assume it'll go to 0 but hope it goes to 1,000,000

Honestly fuck China, they are historically backstabbing little pricks. Crypto isn't the first place they found ways to fuck people. 
Anyone whose done manufacturing work with them knows how shitty they are at a cultural honesty level.

Just google "Bitmain/antminer DOA".
When you are shipping a product from china to people who live a world away, you should have measures in place to ensure the product is going to work or you will fix it quickly. I looked to buy ant miners, but I'm not interested in the hassle of customs and Chinese business practices (which are notoriously backstabbing). 
Just look at the antminer forums. Bitmain relentlessly fucks consumers of their miners and people use who use bitcoin in general.

Waiting for another dip. I avoid meme charts, but some fuck priced in big @ 3k. Could be a trap IMO.

Sounds good to me. I'm hedging my crypto investments with investments in 7.62x51 and 5.56. Hopefully it'll pay off in the event of total nuclear disaster.

Got knee pads OP?

You are right. I let me gaming rig run (r9 390) and it just happens to be about just as good as a 1080 at mining. I've collected ~$200 in bitcoin from it. Adding that to my portfolio is an easy win ;) 
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:25:25
You should leave. True OG Bitcoinners are AnCap at the very least. I look forward to being able to buy recreational nukes with my bitcoins earned from selling small arms to child soldiers.

Exactly. Bitcoin isn't banned. They'll move their money from meme coins to bitcoin.

Be prepared to take a hit on this. You might get $1500-2000 in BTC. No one will give you direct value. But good luck. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 00:06:18
Yep literally had someone unprovoked say all this to me and I just nodded my head. He said "I have stock in bitcoin" "it's at 2K" "gonna sell at a low point in the market around dec and Jan".
I just was like.. ok and nodded my head. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 12:25:52
I've been mining. Mined over $200 mid June - august in BTC. Not a bank breaking amount, but that's extra coin in my wallet. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:22:58
I don't care if you use bitcoins received from your child prostitute rings to pay for your recreational nukes bought from McDonald's(TM) in order to protect yourself from the local warlord.
You could do the same with cash. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 13:04:00
Thankfully those people have no business making speculative investments. If you are betting the house on BTC thats your own problem. You win big? I'm happy for you. You lose? I won't feel bad at all.

Maybe when we dropped to 1800 a month and a half ago, but this weekend ain't shit man

I bought at the ATH, had timed it well where I spent $400 and it had grown to $460. Wouldn't recommend it. 
I've bought at $4300, $4200, and my brother traded me some BTC for fiat at $4200 too. 
Have I lose money today? Ya. But not really much. Less than I spend a month on gas.

It's a little over $200 at this point, but maybe Mid June till today. A while, but that amount of BTC has gained valued with market increases. Not to mention... essentially free because my college apartment has utilities included. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:48:07
Time in market &gt; timing.
Toss some money you can afford to lose, and forget about it. Be aware of the price and wait for a time to act that is advantageous to your position. Whether that be accumulating more at a lower price or selling for some profit taking.

Coinbase to a bank account. Takes a day.

I ordered a new credit card that did $150 cash back on first $500 in 3 months. 
Bought $500 in crypto on coinbase. $150 cash back. So I got my investment in at $350 if you wanna think of it like that.

Wait till the Chinese wake up. The big Chinese money probably moved in the middle of the night, but this news hit at 12am Hong Kong time. I'd wait till 7-8 am to see how money is gonna move. 
I have completely adjusted my life to the Chinese time zone. Easier to watch markets that wat

Buy now, wait for a dip, buy at dip, wait again, buy a later dip.
Best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, next best time is today. Saddle up, we are in for a fucking ride.
S/T $5k USD is gonna happen, L/T? We might see a correction then a push back to the moon. These dips will be less severe overtime because everyone wants one to happen.. so they can buy more.

Just run that shit all day. I mined a little over $200 this summer June to August.
"Reduced life span" is a meme if you keep your cards in good temps and don't fluctuate it. Also; GPU's are essentially obsolete every 2 years or so.

But instant, which if you happen to buy low on a swing and sell on a upswing, you will conceivably net money. Versus buying and waiting for deposit like a cuck.

The founders would be horrified to know that the newcoiners are obsessed with what the global banking system thinks of Bitcoin. The point of bitcoin is to break their influence and government influence. Don't let these bankers try and influence this.

I sold on Wednesday. 
It took me 5hr for me to move from 1 wallet to Coinbase. This was done by Wednesday afternoon. Wednesday afternoon I sold and sent the funds to my bank, Then it took till next day at 5pm for the bank to acknowledge the deposit. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:12:42
Banks do the same thing. If you have $50,000 in the bank, tough luck walking into a local branch and asking for all of it. They'll require advanced notice and time to fill it. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 20:37:17
Yeah my shits all fucked. I was waiting for a deposit from coinbase too.
Coinbase has since put more BTC back in my wallet gaining me 12% on what I sold.
Not sure how to feel tbh. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 23:21:09
Sold Tuesday
Supposed to deposit by Saturday 
Monday I have BTC again

Inb4 flame war, 
Productive decent people don't smoke marijuana frequently or drink frequently. Both of those things are not positive. His thinking isn't totally off. His thinking could be expanded to, "good people don't habitually use any sort of beverage or plant to influence their mood". 
I've been a life long "libertarian". I support anyone's right to gay marry, grow their pot, and own their guns. I just only partake in one of those things, and abstain from 2 of them.

How is sending out a notice that they won't recognize BCC and letting their customers know if they want BCC they need to leave the exchange "taking advantage". 
I mean maybe taking advantage of a blind person because they won't see the notice?

They target fed funds.
Used to target borrowed reserves but interest rates got out of control.
