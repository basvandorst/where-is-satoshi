Yeah, it cleared pretty quickly. Was a bit worried I put the wrong address in, but thankfully I didn’t.

Yeah, thanks for the response. Not too long after I posted this question I found another post where somebody said the same thing.  Seems like all of the best rated sites are a pain in the ass for US customers. Haha.

Ah, bummer. Oh well.

Question:  Are there any wallets that allow you to sell straight from them or do you need to transfer them somewhere else?  I don't have any immediate plans to sell, but I'm just trying to figure out how it works.  Thanks.

So when you send it to the external wallet, should it be instant or can it takes a little while?  Does it depend on the blockchain?
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:06:44
They canceled a transaction on a debit card.  I had to respond yes that it was a legit charge, and it went through then.  So maybe that’s just a credit card deal?

It’s only a taxable event when you sell right?
@_date: 2018-01-28 02:01:33
That looks like an Atlanta number!
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:15:50
Cool. Can we transfer Bitcoin out of coinbase to here? Does it work that way? 
@_date: 2018-01-28 02:13:00
Ah, damn. Forgot about that.  Supposedly in the States, I’ve heard the same applies too. But I have sold or traded anyway, so I’m good at the moment.
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:37:06
Right. Just trying to get the feel for how It works when I get ready to sell.
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:36:27
Well, if it drops significantly enough, I'll buy!
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:38:19
A bit confused with bitstamp...it’s London based so if I withdraw to a US bank account, is my bank considered an international bank?  Or am I misunderstanding how it works with them?
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:38:01
Wonder how much lower it’ll dip?
@_date: 2018-01-30 03:26:48
Under 10k.  My last buy was in the 9s, so if it drops to that or lower, I'm gonna grab some more.
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:57:59
Yeah, I’m gonna experiment some more with Gdax and Coinbase. Just been trying to get away from them since I THOUGHT there were better options out there. Perhaps not? Haha.

It’s capital gains taxes, either long term or short term.
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:12:07
 Excited to see where this goes.
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:01:30
Lol. Nope, don't got anywhere near that much to risk!
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:15:57
So, long term taxes would be anything held over a year and short term on anything less than a year right?
Edit:  Doesn't matter as I don't have enough to sell, but was just wondering.

I love this comment!
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:57:38
�� Not by much, though.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:23:41
I wonder if you have to have some money in the app before you have the option to buy?
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:31:48
Capital One debit card triggered a fraud alert for me, had to confirm it was me, but otherwise, all was good.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:31:33
I was wondering the same thing at first because I was trying to buy with no money in the app too. But then as soon as I saw GA was on the bad boy list I said oh well.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:26:28
Gotcha. Sadly I'm in one of the 4 states that don't have access to it at the moment, so beyond that I got nothing. Sorry.
