This is a terrifying quote.
Utility? Acceptance? Understanding? Who cares about that stuff, just keep pumping your money in!

Not at all comparable. People buy a Ford because they need a method of transportation, and that money goes to Ford to expand and produce more cars.
People buy Bitcoin because ... they expect the price to go up later? And that money goes to some early adopter, who will use it to buy lambos.
Eventually the speculators will want to cash out, and if no one is using Bitcoin for anything they will run out of buyers.

Even if the story is fake, the point is meaningless. Bitcoins might be mathematically secure but you are still a physical human. Government will have no issue compelling you to give up your bitcoins.

I thought this would be seen as a negative on this sub, the government can compel you to give them your bitcoins.

If financial sector workers are parasites, then what do you call someone who holds a deflationary currency? They are sucking value away from society

I didn't claim it was uninvestable, I said that I would never invest in it.
It could or it could not ... the point is don't put all your money in Bitcoin, its a huge risk investment with no floor or ceiling. You can become a millionaire or you can lose EVERYTHING.
The majority of people investing in Bitcoin are trying to "beat the system", they see it as a ticket to early retirement. I would recommend only to invest in Bitcoin if you won't be devastated if that money disappears one day. I don't have money to throw around like that, so I'm out.

I understand Bitcoin and am a big believer in the technology behind it, but I would never "invest" in it.
All of the benefits of Bitcoin you list are not unique or proprietary - they are properties of the blockchain and cryptocurrencies in general. And there are some that have advantages over Bitcoin, which is riding high on the "first-mover" advantage right now.
Bitcoins rapid gains over the last year are not based on increased utility of bitcoin - they are based on speculation of future higher prices and fear of missing out. This is a bubble, and a very dangerous one.
In my opinion Bitcoin will soon reach highs that it will not return to for years, if ever, and then crash.
The public eye is on Bitcoin now, if the bubble bursts it may create distrust it can never recover from. Comparing bitcoin to the internet is disingenuous - its possible for a different  decentralized, block-chain based currency like you describe to take off, and for bitcoin to crater to nothing.

Because thats what you do with money? Trade it for stuff?

The fact that people believe this makes me nervous about the future of Bitcoin
