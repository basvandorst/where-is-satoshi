I can’t give any statistics but over here in Australia, I would say quite a few people are talking about it over the past few weeks. Heard it a few times at work and at a party. Still don’t think that many actually own any and if they do it’s usually only for a quick profit. But I’d say younger males are the majority that I here mention it which isn’t surprising

Try Stellar Lumen. Costs like $0.00002 to send a transaction and is super fast and up by about 700% in the past month. Best altcoin I’ve bought.

I just went with them recently to buy some alts, they were fast and I can’t complain.

I’ve been hearing about the “bubble” crashing every single day since I invested a few months ago, who knew that multiplying by 5x was a sign it was ready to crash. No one knows what’s going to happen, so follow bitcoin and crypto updates and look at past trends to get a reasonable idea of what’s going to happen in the future. I presume up is the answer

I'd like to nominate the **Open Source Malaria project** (OSM)
So I have just graduated from a Bachelor of Science and in my final semester I did a project with OSM. It was a wonderful project and I learnt so much valuable infomation. Anyway, some background on the OSM project is that it is an open source forum for anyone that is able and willing to contribute to research into Malaria. This can include the chemistry side(my side) which could include synthesising compounds that can be tested by the biologists against malaria parasites. Everyone was so friendly, and welcoming when I commenced my project and they are all doing it for a great cause. Malaria is becoming quite resistant to many of the drugs used today and it is necessary to keep on top of Malaria, especially when there is not much funding or research into it as it is more prevalent in poorer nations. 
Now, I dont even think they have a donation page, let alone a place to donate Bitcoin but you could always email them [here](opensourcemalaria and find out or contact the creator, Mat Todd. None of these people ask for any money contributions at all and the process of researching creating and testing these possible drugs is an arduous and expensive process, which I found out through my project and its for a wonderful cause. Anyway, thank you for doing this, its a great thing to see and I wish you all the best. Cheers.

Its now dropped over 6% in a few hours, which is quite a lot. All the other corrections took multiple days until they started to go back up so if it keeps trending like this, then it could be the "real drop". But it could be just another minor correction, especially since it has been gaining a lot today.

I'm prepared to buy it when it's trending up. It was trending up but I knew the dip would come eventually and now it's trending down. Why buy it now even though it's less when it's predicted to go down even more. I think I'll wait until it starts heading.
