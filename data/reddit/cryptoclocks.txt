My buddy and I created a new Android app called CryptoClocks that we're giving away for free at the moment. You can add this app to any cheap Android tablet to replace any clock in your house or just use as another screen in your office to watch crypto.
* Change the text to any font size, color, or location you want.
* Share themes you create with the community by exporting your themes into text, then copy and paste that text here on Reddit.
* Add any coin you want from Bitfinex, Kraken, Bitstamp.
Please let us know what you think of the app and if you have any suggestions for improving it! Thank you for checking it out.

Lightning Network Brings Starbucks, eBay, and Amazon to Bitcoin

The wealthy and banks don't have to wish, I think this is what we're seeing...

BTC is currently a store of value, it's not effective for sending small transactions. That will change soon with lightning network. Stop spreading fud this problem is already being addressed appropriately.

I find it interesting how everyone thinks Bitcoin's price is so unpredictable, lets look at the last few corrections.
We just went from 19,800 to 14,800, 25% correction.
Before that we went from 17,000 to 13,000, 24% correction.
Then before that, it was 11,300 to 8,000, 23%.
Look, the bus sometimes needs to turn around to pick up more hodlers, but the destination hasn't changed. Yes BC H can convince the weak hands that this is the flippening, like they did during 7,700 to 5,400, but at least we got some entertaining youtube videos out of it of people saying how badly they were duped from that BC H pump and dump.
Don't fall for the lies and the fud, this is normal, the weak hands will always go to another coin, it just so happens it was bch this time, but they'll be back after they are full of regret.

Too much coke

No I'm not new, are you saying we have seen a run up like this before in as short of an amount of time?
Take some time to think about it before you start talking to someone like their grandpa.

I certainly agree with you that the continued rise of bitcoin is not guaranteed, but it's certainly very likely imo given it's history and overall trajectory.
It's incredibly hard to time the bottom of the dip, and my personal approach is don't try to snipe it, throw a grenade at it and try to hit it somewhere. If it drops another $200 after you buy, at least you got a part of it. Sure beats buying at an all time high.

You sound just as crazy as the people who said it'd reach $10k when it was only $700 at the beginning of the year. Those people were so wrong!

Many people make the mistake of selling early, I consider that fact part of the real world. In fact it's hard to argue that panic selling when it's dipping has ever been a good call with Bitcoin unless you actually know a correction is happening or you have the ability to time the bottom of the dip.
I think a post like this that might stop someone from panic selling is helpful and useful to the real world.

Well said. I didn't mention anything about the technology or how secure Bitcoin is, but I think this only adds to the point of things to consider before selling. When someone is panicked and feel like they only have a few seconds to make a decision, taking this into consideration as well certainly helps.

Just a matter of time man. Whatever doesn't adapt only gets left behind. Banks are done for. I only came to know about btc for about 2 years now, and i already feel better putting my money in btc than banks or government, even with this crazy ass volatility. At least I know my money is in my pocket.

I made this mistake. Sold my house for Bitcoin and then bought a lambo with Bitcoin, but then I realized I didn't have a house.
