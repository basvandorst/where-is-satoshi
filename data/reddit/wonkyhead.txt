Hello 2006
@_date: 2017-11-07 07:30:06
This kind of comment is why it's so hard to take this sub seriously. I honestly have no idea if you're joking or not.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:36:01
At least you didn't set half to incremental buys and hold the rest to eyeball when to put the rest in then chicken shit out at the last minute like... some other people. &gt;_&lt;
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:35:53
Just in case.
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:26:45
looks like 6300 is the ceiling?
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:58:09
This man made more today than most people will in their lifetime.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:35:32
I think I'll set a sell order at 4000 before I go to sleep.
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:22:59
What makes you think it'll dip that far?
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:04:25
If it keeps going at this rate til Monday it will be at 0.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:31:00
This is a really terrible conclusion to draw given that you have the benefit of hindsight.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:47:15
At least it wasn't 500$. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:02:57
And nobody cares.

Fringe investments dry up first, core investments dry up after. It's very obvious to me, but I'm sure others will disagree without a real reason why.
Just think of what you would do with your own money. Maybe 1% in crypto 10% in stocks and the rest in your 401k?

That's really not how anything works. This is the same idiot mentality that leads so many lottery winners to bankruptcy.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:38:57
You're an idiot.
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:40:26
Nah, 3 crypto months is about about a year. So the stock market corrects about every 8 years so expect 12-16 months to recover previous ATH and 24-30 months to reach next peak.
Depending on all the other factors of course.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:26:49
20% is a lot.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:51:23
Big investment for a market that lasts 18 months.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:48:45
About June 2016 to December 2017.
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:54:37
More people know that the parabola has ended and reversed.
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:29:49
I thought that was the joke.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:57:20
And everyone knows you can't race lambos on a **low orbiting satellite**.
@_date: 2018-02-19 01:00:40
What are the fees like?
@_date: 2017-10-21 04:12:14
How many did you buy for yourself?
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:47:35
Nothing, you just don't have a clue what I said.
@_date: 2017-10-21 00:45:58
Newbie here, I appreciate this thread because all the euphoria is pretty empty from a learning standpoint, but I was just wonder if you  could expound on this comment a bit. Do you mean if that 5500ish is a soft floor and if it falls through that it could go much lower?
@_date: 2018-02-19 01:04:24
It was .01$ in my dream about a week ago. I bought 55 before the flash crash turned around and the price went back up to 3500. I've never felt more conflicted between being happy I made so much money and the regret of not buying more.

Dumbest thing I've read on this sub so far, and let me tell you there are some delusional people here.
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:06:31
No fees for limit trades.
