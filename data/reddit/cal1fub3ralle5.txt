About 20 min after I made the transaction I know have 6 transactions but the status is still 0/offline.
Any responses would be greatly appreciated.
I am not sure if I remember correctly, would I have to wait for my computer to download the entire blockchain before my transaction is made?

No, I didn't think it was worth it. I'm just trying to move like $20 that I had left.
Is it too late to do it now, since I already sent the transaction?

Great idea. It would also be cool to have one shirt with all 5 logos on it, I would be down to buy that if you ever make it.

Maybe Kurt Cobain faked his death in order to devote more time to developing bitcoin.

Once I had 100 btc worth of AsicMiner stock, now its basically worthless. 
If you send me any bitcoin I promise I will not buy any stocks this time.

Forgive me if this is a stupid question, but how is placing stealth orders beneficial? In my mind it would be beneficial for sell orders because the price would't crash, but I can't see why someone would do this when they're buying.

I like the bitcoin prices in those pics, although i hope it's not an omen.

What do you mean by Burnside and TAT?
Are those alternatives to ASICMINER shares?

Have you tried CampBX? You can use Dwolla to fund your account on there and buy them.

Ahh thanks for clearing that up for me.
Why do you think it is better to reinvest into TAT from Burnside, aren't they essentially the same?

Boston Globe carrier, I probably have one of the most menial jobs on this subreddit, but it's just a cover for my real occupation.... watching BTC charts!

Why do you think the dividend will drop 70%?
