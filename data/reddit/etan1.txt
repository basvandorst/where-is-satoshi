There is also a bit of theoretical security you gain by using separate addresses. When you spend from an address you reveal its public key, which makes the address vulnerable to quantum computer.

Unfortunately, funding was not successful :(
Therefore, there won't be a 2015 festival.

Bitcoin ABC, Electron etc. I haven’t tried them yet, so please inform yourself as well. 
Please also keep in mind that if you send your full balance to a new address in one go, that all your existing addresses will become linked together. You can use a wallet with coin control features to avoid that to some degree.

? its as if you get paid daily vs getting paid monthly. payment frequency matters. just because the monthly payment is bigger than a daily payment doesnt mean that that miner earns more money per month ;-) imagine 200$ a day vs 3000$ a month.

BTC tx are invalid on BCH and vice versa. They updated the replay protection to be strong in both ways. No need to “construct tx in a special way”

BCC takes about 3 min atm per block. See fork.lol &gt; POW &gt; speed.
Maybe the exchange required X confirmations to happen before accepting your transfer?

Mine 1 hr:
• 30 blocks / hr * 10k $ / block = 300k $
• 6 blocks / hr * 50k $ / block = 300k $
blocks per hours matters for mining profitability.

They also had (maybe still have) a really giant ad at the airport in the arrival hall.

If you are hacked, an attacker or an employee getting some $ or even someone at Apple who wants to get rich may simply upload a new binary to the app store that collects all Bitcoins at a set day. It's not possible to secure against such an attack with an app distributed over the app store that cannot be verified and auto updates by default.
This is true for all mobile wallets. And even if the private key is protected by Touch ID, attacker may simply sign his own transaction and keep it around in memory, the next time you unlock the key for regular use. Then, later, broadcast the tx to collect the coins.
It is not possible to create a fully secure mobile wallet. Don't keep more than you can afford to lose on them. The only secure thing are hardware wallets. Mobile wallets can only get secure if we can deploy our own custom unmodifiable code to be run on the secure enclave of the phone (similar to Apple Pay), which is very unlikely to happen soon.

It is just an inconvenience. You call the bank and have it reversed.

You need to hold the QR code quite far away.
On the other hand, while BTC hashrate was down they actually spent more on the BTC TX fee than they ripped off when I topped up 20.- ^_^

You need to show your ID to get a swiss sim card.
But you could just act as a tourist and ask a random stranger if he could help you buying BTC with their phone number ;-)
@_date: 2017-09-06 21:35:44
only debit card. credit card / apple pay does not work for buying btc
@_date: 2017-09-04 06:59:12
At some terminals that support both you can downgrade by first inserting the card into the chip reader in an incorrect way (eg chip outside). On some terminals it will bug out and allow to swipe the card now, sometimes without even signing. One example are my local McDonald’s kiosks. Doing this all the time because it’s faster than waiting to enter the PIN.

or just buy the btc, send it a couple times theough shapeshift and monero, and its as clean as it can get ;-)

BTW you dont need to press any buttons. Just touch the screen once to skip the advertisement, then scan your Bitcoin address QR code without selecting any menu.
Ah, and NFC top up works as well, but only with debit card.

You generate wallet, write it down, delete the wallet, restore it from the paper, before sending funds to it.

Import the priv key into a segwit wallet to get your btc, import the same priv key into abc to get your bcc.
when you spend the bcc in abc, youll still have your btc.
when you spend your btc, make sure you are using a wallet that offers replay protection, so that the bcc is unaffected.
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:49:22
Wait until a few weeks after the transition is complete before deciding on one. For now, just know that if you have paper wallet with private key you don’t have to do anything.
Also, if you spend your bcc first (eg by sending it to a different bcc only paper wallet) you are also safe regardless of what btc wallet you are using, as the bcc is already spent.
@_date: 2016-07-03 14:34:52
Nope. After the reward is halved to levels of 1 satoshi, no more btc are generated.
