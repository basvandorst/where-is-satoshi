Looks a bit like Ross Ulbricht in 15 years, no?

If you ever want to hack on Bitcoin projects here in SF, give me a holla ;-)

Out of curiosity, may I ask in which jurisdiction you live? Here in the US I believe it's very risky for the average Joe to run exits.

9800 BTC is a very risky bet for such an unproven concept.

Any lawyers out there interested in pursuing this case in exchange for BTC or even pro-bono?

While I think this change is good, the number of people making the decision is frighteningly small compared to the number of users this affects. Once 3-4 ACKs happen by the main devs then it's pulled in. I hope going forward people will have the knowledge and opportunity to participate in these decisions more and more.

"Compromised" doesn't just mean your data is exfiltrated. It could also mean the random number generator hardware is ever-so-slightly tweaked so as to undermine all of the crypto operations your processor performs.
In our case, that would be the secp256k elliptic curve algorithm our wallet addresses are (in part) secured with.

Sent to my localbitcoins.com email too. Looks like one of their accounts compromised?

I also buy my cards last minute. That explains why I had to wander around around Home Depot last night for 30 minutes waiting to be able to pay for my stuff.

Just watched the Q&amp;A. If we don't meet the criteria for the Dapps fund, do we still get to present? Does that mean it's impossible to "place"? Can we form our own teams?

I originally wasn't going to make a stink about it, but I guess now it's appropriate I bring this story up --
Now I don't feel so bad for calling out Coinbase on their lacking security practices when they recently asked me (over plaintext email) for financial information.
When I raised my concerns, I was given the option to use their shared Dropbox folder instead. Much better than sending it to their Google-hosted email account, I'm sure.
I sent them a scrypt-encrypted zip, but after they couldn't figure out how to open it, I had to use an encrypted PDF instead.
No PGP key to speak of either, so I had to verify the requestor's identity through their browser web support chat.
Yes Coinbase, some of us Bitcoin folk are a *little* concerned with privacy and security!

Nothing specific, just some documents detailing the source of my funds used to purchase Bitcoin. I understand why they need that kind of stuff, but it was a bit unsettling receiving that sort of email out of the blue, from a stranger, with no detailed instructions on what I needed to provide, how to securely provide it, why I needed to provide it, and what would happen if I didn't.

There are three possibilities:
1. This is a Fed agent. They have all this data, after all. Could be trying to honeypot an unsuspecting purchaser, gather more heuristically-interesting blockchain data based on the purchaser's address, or cast a very dark criminal shadow on Darkleaks (criminalizing anyone who works on it).
2. This is a scam. I guess we'll see once the "chunks" are released (perhaps they'll be verifiable by an ex-user?)
3. This is the actual dude. He's got balls, that's for sure. After seeing how intensely the Feds prosecuted Ross, I'm sure they're interested to snag him as well. Or at least capture as an informant. He must feel safe where he is (not America) and have a huge amount of confidence his laptop and tor exit nodes aren't compromised. Not to mention the thugs that would be out to get him. Or perhaps he's already been snagged, which would fall under scenario 
Who knows. If he really is selling the data, he must think he can get a pretty penny for it. The Feds don't need it and the thugs have already assumed their info was compromised in the bust.

Sounds like a medical condition. Imagine the headlines -- "Governor Falls Victim to Darkleaks During Re-election Campaign"
This is going to be the shit.

Nice design. I think a quick description of what the product does (before the page-break) would make it much more clear though. Answers the question... "certify what?"
[Stripe's]( is one of the best product pages I've seen in a long time.

Indeed, but it allows for more attack surfaces to be exposed. A traffic correlation attack is feasible if the attacker has some reasonable guess of the user's entry point and visibility into the exit node's traffic.
Also, if the user isn't super diligent about ensuring valid HTTPS is used **everywhere** then a compromised exit node could inject malicious JS to exploit an 0-day in the user's browser. The FBI famously did this before the takedown of SR1. Or simply inject malware into anything he/she downloads.
I'm not an export on Tor, but this is the post-Snowden era, after all. These are well-known attacks. Just thinking the SR2 developer would probably be well-versed on this sort of thing, so I'm surprised he's coming out of the shadows like this and posting on social media.
