I'm Roger Ver, long time Bitcoin proponent.
About 7 months ago, purely as a favor to Mtgox, I made a video stating that their fiat withdrawal problems were not being caused by a lack of liquidity. I made no claims regarding their solvency. While everything I said in the video was factually true, today I have come to regret making it for them. It ended up causing the community put additional trust in an entity that deserved none. As someone who personally had a life changing amount of bitcoins stuck in Mtgox, I can fully understand the anger felt by the community when the news broke that Mtgox had lost nearly all of the bitcoins their customers had on deposit. I'm very sorry for the people around the world who have lost money because of this, but we need to understand the whole picture. This issue was caused by poor programming skills and a total lack of book keeping on the part of Mtgox. It was caused by a single mismanaged company, not by any problem with Bitcoin itself. In fact, today Bitcoin is stronger than ever before. We've all learned not to store large amounts of funds in wallets we don't control. We no longer have to deal with an exchange that can't process withdrawals in a timely manner, takes months to respond to support requests, and who's prices deviate wildly from the other exchanges. We've had the recent wonderful announcements that Playboy,  and  are now accepting Bitcoin. Long time business professional Barry Silbert of  will be opening a first rate Bitcoin exchange this summer, and traditional incubators such as   and  Startups are focusing on creating hundreds of new Bitcoin businesses. The future is brighter than ever before.

Here's another thing you could do:
* When changing your withdraw address add a second email confirmation step where you click a link in the email before actually updating the address.
* Lock the withdraw address for the first 24 hours after you change your email (even if the account is empty).
* Send an email notice to the old email when an email change is requested. This would be a notice, not a confirmation with a link, because they might be changing email because they don't have access to the old one.
* You could also possibly have a 24 hour wait before the email is actually changed too.
* Password changes to the account could also have an email confirmation step.
Wait that's more than one thing isn't it... o_O

 A person actually compares the pic taken by the atm with the pic on the person's gov't id? That can't be very reliable. Plenty of people look very different than the picture on their license (grow a beard, dye hair, different hair cut, etc...) _and_ there are lots of people who look similar to others. 
Seems trying to match the pic to the license presented is kind of a fools game.

Very, very interesting proposal. 
Mark could keep a small percentage of the company (as a shareholder), but, say, 90-95% would have to be divvied up between the new shareholders on a pro-rata basis as mentioned. Of course, there would be a board of directors who would hire a CEO, etc., and the shareholders would have voting rights to elect the board of directors. Mark would probably not be involved in running the business-- that would be up to the new CEO.
Mark would basically be giving (most) of his (profitable and established) business to the current customers to redeem himself. After that point, it would be a public company, controlled by the shareholders, and would essentially not be the same business, thus wouldn't need to suffer from the credibility and trust issues surrounding Mark or the old Gox
Current customers who lost money would slowly earn it back via dividends.
This is an idea I might be able to get behind.
**Edit:** The logistics wouldn't have to be too bad either.  Mark turns over all Mt.Gox assets (USD, BTC, accounts, domains, trademarks, codebase, etc.) to a trusted third party in the US, who sets up a new corporation with them and issues stock to the customers based on their account holdings. A shareholder meeting is then held to propose and elect the board, who then hire a CEO to set the business back up.  The new Gox could be up, running, and earning a profit in short order.

The core devs can't do anything without changing the bitcoin protcol and destroying bitcoin at the same time.
A majority of miners and mining pools in collusion could theoretically roll back (all) transactions to a given point in time and start an alternate blockchain. That would have a devastating effect on bitcoin as well.

BANK OF MEXICO
MARCH 10, 2014
PRESS RELEASE
Warning about the use of virtual assets as a substitute for legal tender methods of payment.
Since international media and some sectors of the public have recently had increased interest in bitcoin, litecoin and similar virtual assets, the Bank of Mexico feels it important to provide information and warn people of the risks of using these virtual assets.
These assets are a mechanism for storage and exchange of electronic information and are not backed by any institution, which means they are not a legal tender currency. The current legal requirements do not recognize them as an official medium of exchange nor as a store of value or any other form of investment.
As of today, virtual assets are not popular in any relevant sense in Mexico. Nevertheless, the Bank of Mexico would like to warn the people about the inherent risks of acquiring these assets and using them as substitutes for conventional methods of payment.  It is important to underscore that in addition to what is stated here, other authorities may also issue information or regulations concerning additional risks.
In any case, these assets present important differences with legal tender currency, among them:
* They are not legal tender currency in Mexico, since the Bank of Mexico does not issue nor back them. In the same way, they are not foreign currency since no foreign currency authority issues or backs them.
* To accompany the first point, they are not legal tender for any debts or payments, and their use as a form of payment is not guaranteed, since businesses and anyone else are not required to accept them.
* The Bank of Mexico does not regulate nor supervise them.
* Financial institutions regulated by Mexico are not authorized to use nor carry out any operations with them.
* In other jurisdictions, they have been allegedly used in illicit operations, including fraud and money laundering.
* There is no guarantee or regulation to ensure that consumers and businesses that acquire this type of asset can recuperate their money. Moreover, since there is no identifiable organization that issues these assets, or third party that assumes the responsibility for these assets, it would be difficult to have legal recourse if they are lost.
* Their price in terms of Mexican Pesos or other currencies, determined by those who deal in these assets, has been volatile. This is a consequence of their highly speculative character and the heightened sensitivity of their price to the changes in confidence of the users. For example, technological changes, the rise of new virtual assets, legal restrictions, etc. As a consequence, acquiring and using these assets carry a high risk of depreciation and ultimately, monetary loss.
Due to the aforementioned, anyone who accepts this type of asset in exchange for a good or service, or otherwise acquires it, assumes the risks mentioned above.
Even if these virtual assets do not currently present a risk to the financial system, nor to payment systems, the Bank of Mexico, in coordination with other authorities, will closely follow the development and potential implications of them, and if deemed necessary, will issue relevant regulations.

Awesome, except for the "connect with Facebook" requirement.
Sorry, that's a deal killer.  Have local accounts or add OAuth as an option.
Edit: Thanks for the tips! I finally figured it out. I originally only saw the "connect with facebook" button for reddit / twitter / github, etc., which is what confused me.

To be fair, *using* the exchange and immediately removing any money has slightly different risks than *storing* your money long-term on the exchange.

Any ideas on how to fix (improve) these two areas? An "Improvement Proposal" usually has ideas on how to improve something, rather that only pointing out potentially problematic areas.
@_date: 2014-04-19 17:42:29
To the right.  Like 1.45 bits = 145 satoshis or 0.00000145 bitcoin.

Do you have a pamphlet or a FAQ for these general(ish) questions? I'm not ready to purchase one now, but I'm mulling over the idea. So I'm just interested in some general info, and I'm sure others are as well.
If there's no public FAQ, I guess I'll get in touch with one of the salespeople.

You realize the company selling the guns has to be an FFL, and the buyers have to fill out the form 4473 for the NICS background check, right?  That's not anonymous.

Actually, the best way to warn them would be to remove a small amount and then send it back. They should notice the strange transaction and move their funds.
@_date: 2014-02-24 05:32:02
Awesome, that's the best of both worlds.
There could still be a possible attack for a breached account. If BTC comes in automatically on a regular basis (mining payments, etc), then the attacker could empty the account (sending the BTC to your wallet), change the address, then wait a short time for more coins to be deposited and then steal them.  Might be somewhat contrived....
@_date: 2014-03-11 18:49:45
Ok, so and it is then.

Two things-- As an American, if you take citizenship in another country, the US interprets that as renouncing your US citizenship. Second, after renouncing US citizenship, you still have to pay taxes for ten years after that, and then you're free.

1MB is the protcol limit. Currently most mining pools limit it to about 1/5 or 1/4 of that.

When money is involved (instead of just phone numbers), there will be malware designed specifically to send the money elsewhere, while displaying the "correct" contact who was supposed to be the recipient.  Unless you see and verify the actual address before broadcasting the transaction to the network, there's a chance that malware can steal the money.

To be fair, he put his name in this one, instead of signing off as "Gox Team".

To be fair, he said losing a private key, not having it guessed.

The free market says there's about a 7-8% chance of getting MtGox funds back. (That's my naïve interpretation of the [bids for GoxBTC on bitcoinbuilder](

I don't know. Once you accidentally steal from a few offline cold storage addresses that people are monitoring, it'd be kinda obvious what is happening.

A) It's probably programmed to empty any wallet, B) loose change adds up, though that small it would take some time.

And it can do much more than that too. I could map out the 40 bytes to whatever I want. Start with a flag value to mark it as a transaction in my system, then have an ID to point to a given record in my system, then have a checksum to prove that the record in my system has not changed since the transaction was included in the block (a few bytes of a hash of my record). You could do that and still have room in the 40 bytes for something else.

No, the block chain could be centralized, and the wallet itself (the private keys) could be local on your phone.

a) You entered the wrong payment address, thus it is your responsibility.
b) They assured you twice they would update the address to the new one you provided, thus it it now their responsibility.
It's a close call, but I'd have to go with (b), they assumed the responsibility (regardless of their FAQs) after they assured you twice that they would change the address.

This is only for goxbtc that are already at bitcoinbuilder, which means that they are already in bitcoinbuilder's mtgox account, meaning bitcoinbuilder already controls/has claim to them in terms of filing for a claim in Japan.
