fortunately for the everyone grandmas are not the target market of bitcoin and are free to continue literally using a plastic stick to manually scratch a barely legible squiggly line of black water onto a flimsy little sheet of bleached-wood that has to be *physically moved over 2-5 days across the country* to be processed (even though all of her money at the bank already only exists in a digital form anyway and so digitally is exactly how the bank will transfer the money to the business she made the purchase at)
...and meanwhile the line behind her is building rapidly with consumers waiting to scan a QR code with their smartphones so the transaction can be handled online in 2 seconds.

You have to wait **days** just to transfer money online to a friend? That can't be possible, because in the US it takes 30 seconds at most.


I think you must have visited the US in the 1970s and are still imagining it as being the same, because that was only true literally 20+ years ago.
Everyone I know can instantly send/receive money to anyone else from anywhere just by knowing either your name, or your phone number, or your email.
If I know your name, I can use Facebook to send you money from anywhere in 5 seconds. 
If i know your phone number i can use Paypal or Venmo to send you money instantly from anywhere. 
If I know your Snapchat I can use Snapchat to send you money from instantly from anywhere. 
And if i know your email I can use any of the previous options to send you money instantly from anywhere.

The same way everyone does anything else online that they don't know what to do, which website to use, what to download, etc.
Step 1. Press the power button on your computer and log in using your username and password. 
Step 2. Open your preferred browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, etc.) and go to Google.com
Step 3. search "how to (enter a topic or descriptive phrase)"
Step 4. Check out the results - if you don't find something helpful within 1-2 minutes, try rephrasing your search phrase 
Step 5. Profit???

The actual bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi Namako actually suggested that optional escrow systems for bitcoin transactions be implemented where appropriate

Why the fuck would any business in the world request payment from a customer by VERBALLY saying "0.000724666 bitcoins please"? 
 
Smartphones are ubiquitous in the modern world and one of the inifinite number of things they can do is **scan QR codes for payments via smartphone at the literal touch of a literal button**
