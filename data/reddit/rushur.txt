nope. Jesus could not care less about temples. It was about usury.

HA! You're just trolling me now. Cheers.

True, usury wasn't all he was against, he was against capitalism in general.Those doves were taken from the poor and sold for sacrifices.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:21:12
I would argue Jesus whole message was to not be a dick, anywhere. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:19:54
He flipped the tables of the capitalists calling them thieves FFS, pay attention. Sermon on the Mount is as antithetical to capitalism as any teaching could possibly be.

Profit, interest and rent are all sins according to the spiritual message of Jesus.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:12:57
Actually no, USURY was the real issue.
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:18:52
His whole story is a message of compassion. How is "do unto others.." compatible with capitalism?  Why you want to believe he was only concerned with the sanctity of church buildings is beyond me. And that you would even take the term "house of God" so literally is also pathetic.
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:10:22
And you actually think it's about the building and not the thieving??
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:20:53


um... what?


He came there to preach and found that shit going on.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:51:58
Do you need "sources" to tell you taking advantage of others is wrong?
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:55:24
Wow is what I say to anyone who believes and argues that that passage is about Jesus being pissed only because those people were thieving in a "sacred" building and not thieving in general. They were capitalists and he called them thieves.

I'm more into the spiritual message of the Christ than the literal interpretations and translations of the bible which I regard as the science of the infinitely absurd. The "House of the Lord" is anywhere people pray together. Jesus was definitely against usury no matter where it took place. In this particular passage it is clear to me that it's the usury that has upset him, not that it was taking place in a particular 'sacred' building.

If you want to believe that capitalism is supported by Christ, go right ahead. I have no problem with you believing that.

I just bought .48 bitcoin ($260USD) two days ago and it's up to $273USD today.. 
@_date: 2016-06-27 12:02:38
can someone tell me what I'm looking at? 
@_date: 2016-06-27 14:35:34
thanks!  so it's basically a memory storage device like a usb memory stick? or are the private and public keys physical like engraved or something? 
@_date: 2016-02-03 19:01:03
I believe you are referring to commodity money, as opposed to fiat.
The foundation of capitalism is private property (not to be confused with personal property)
@_date: 2016-02-03 15:10:05
Capitalism is what they're feeling actually.  Churchill's definition of 'Socialism' may be a tad biased. 
@_date: 2016-10-28 14:59:57
I might as well go to sleep. Your line of argument/reasoning is tiring. It's easy to see you are just beginning to think things through and get your facts straight. 
@_date: 2016-10-28 14:08:47
I'm a left libertarian aka libertarian socialist aka anarchist
Right libertarianism aka anarcho-capitalism is a joke because it requires the State.
@_date: 2016-10-28 14:05:18


 how is the taxing of profits/rent/interest/capital gains generated by the capitalist economy created and sustained by the State not fair? 
Just with that I proved that your twisted version of libertarianism (so called "right libertarianism", a USA phenomenon) believes private power should be able to do whatever it wants while requiring the State to protect it's private property, provide the infrastructure, and educate the workers.
@_date: 2016-10-28 13:52:00
are you a right libertarian or left libertarian? 
are you familiar with the different forms of democracy. ie majoritarian vs. consensus?
@_date: 2016-10-28 15:00:00
"Lulz" "redistributive utopia" "kibbutz mode" ..and you're actually accusing an anarchist of requiring the State??   
ugh, am I really engaging with this?...   I think not. You have a lot of learning to do "comrade"
@_date: 2016-10-28 20:30:59
well left libertarianism is stateless so you're alright there. A truly democratic government  (consensus based) could determine tax rates morally. But you're right, taxing labour is always immoral. What I've been trying to say is if we're living in a capitalist economy all taxes should come from capitalist income. I'm  also saying that right libertarianism requires a State t
o uphold/enforce the legal concept of private property.

fewer than 24 hours sounds like we're talking about single hours to me
