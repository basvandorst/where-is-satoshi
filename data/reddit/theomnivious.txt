Eh, depends, the one good reason for buying Futures instead of actual BTC is that no one can rob a futures agreement from you. Many people get hacked and lose all of the BTC each day, so if you only plan on buying BTC long term, futures are actually a decent way to do that while assuming less risk.

Try Vertcoin, NiceHash was a huge chunk of the hashing power, so difficulty is way down. They've got a one click miner (Its more like 10 clicks but its super easy), and the VTC Halving is about to occur on 12/12, so it'd be nice to mine some before that happens I'd bet.

Could try doing a small investment in Alt Coins after this next price rise slows down, maybe you could turn 0.1BTC into 0.2BTC pretty easily if you choose appropriately. I'm gonna shill out and tell you to check out Vertcoin, the coin has a lot of potential and a really solid community/dev team.

It's like if you were to purchase a million ears of corn, or a million barrels of oil; except instead of actually owning them and bothering to store them and sell, you just bet on the price going up or down essentially. Futures act like proxy ownership for commodities and are a way to gain profit off the value of a commodity without actually buying/selling it to influence market value.
It's definitely going to cause some kind of a bubble, because futures markets are exactly the reason why the American Housing Market crashed. It could actually be sustainable depending on how its implemented, but regardless it's going to boost prices considerably.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:15:10
That's also what I don't get; you can't just go out buy a million barrels of oil, you can use futures instead to "buy" them and gain/lose based on the price of oil. But you can literally just go to Coinbase and actually buy bitcoin instead of using futures, its like owning Bitcoin by proxy.
If people buy futures in Bitcoin that gives Bitcoin the presentation that its a legitimate market. This will increase adoption of Bitcoin and draw in even more investment. Additionally, if people buy futures and are optimistic about the price this is immediately visible, which will then make more people buy and drive up the price. 
There is HUGE potential for a crash, but that might be necessary to establish a stabilized Bitcoin.

If there are predatory Sybil attacks, even small scale, that also hurts the attacker for a huge portion. Even a small attack will make a large number of people immediately abandon the coin, dropping value drastically. But PoS is probably safer than PoS I feel, as ASICS are still ASICS after an attack, while the PoS coins become worthless.

Actually try AwesomeMiner if you have AMD cards, then point your miner at ZPool and HashRefinery. All you need is your BTC address, so its very similar to NiceHash, while being better than WinMiner and MinerGate.

Vertcoin itself is a legitimate coin and is doing everything possible to stay as decentralized as possible. People are so concerned over this matter, that a pool obtaining 17% of the hashrate is viewed as a serious problem.

Altcoins are also relatively new, the most popular being Litecoin which only came into favor with the latest bubble in December. I believe that altcoins will follow similar boom cycles to that of bitcoin, but will have to coincide with bitcoins success. 
At the moment, bitcoin is at the lowest price it has been in 4 months, and the same for altcoins. Once a new boom hits, we'll see a possible resurgence; but for now the altcoin market is very slow.
That said, Litecoin is going to become more centralized in the coming months due to Scrypt ASICs and become more akin to Bitcoin, and smaller Scrypt coins may not survive the ASIC phasing. Coins like Vertcoin however remain far more decentralized as they're ASIC resistant and will keep the total hashrate in as many hands as possible, while also having very active developers.

It still shows that you are required to withdraw a large amount of money at once to make it cost effective. If he had withdrew 100 Euros, he would have only lost about 6% to fees, which is still stupidly high.
Same with using paypal, transactions of less than $2.00 USD are almost entirely taken away in fees. With bitcoin, any transaction of any size currently costs about 7 cents for immediate processing, or it can cost absolutely nothing if you're willing to wait for awhile.

I think I should have found something that they could have bought online with it immediately; I told my housemate that he could buy the new Mastodon CD with the Bitcoin from the Coinbase offer, and I think hes going to do that later.
Is there anything that most people would want that $10 of Bitcoin could buy?
@_date: 2014-03-05 03:56:18
You simply plug in your external hard drive and open the Bitcoin wallet application from the external hard drive.
I'm fairly certain that's how it works with Bitcoin Qt, I use Multibit so I'm not 100% on how Qt works.

You pay the 2-3% anyway, but if you could completely remove Credit Card companies, you can ignore that. 
Businesses that accept Bitcoin instead of Credit Cards can charge more than 3% less, even up to 10% if they get rid of Paypal. While its not huge for an individual, if everyone could change, the savings would be enormous.
@_date: 2014-06-12 01:03:00

It affects you greatly, and its your loss that you don't realize this. Over the course of the last 100 years the dollar has lost 95% of its value and over 50% in the past 20 years.

Don't have to deal with Credit Card fees, and the hope is that he wouldn't have to convert the Bitcoin to cash; he would then spend it as Bitcoin, or pay his employees with it if they wanted, or something of that like.
@_date: 2014-06-12 02:51:00
The circumstances of that make it seem as though its a fake, but could be tested if someone had knowledge of gold. I don't have much knowledge on gold, but I do know it has a very similar weight to lead, so the coin could be lead with gold leaf on the exterior. From here, I know that lead is easily malleable so if I could bend the coin in my hands, its fake.
If the above proved true, I would probably buy it, but I would need to have the knowledge to make a smart decision even if the investment is fairly small.

You're not understanding the scenario here at all, are you?
I'm not giving away the Bitcoin, Coinbase is. I have no access to it, I'm merely suggesting that they make an account with their umn.edu Emails and get it with virtually no hassle.
@_date: 2014-06-11 23:26:33
Exactly; Long term I see it completely phasing out Credit Card companies and businesses could finally not charge the extra flat 3% on all purchases. Bitcoin could literally give everyone 3% more value for their money. 3% doesn't sound like much, but it adds up over a long time.
If the current cost of transaction fees stays stable at $0.07USD then buying anything over $2USD saves you money, assuming credit card companies and the fees passed over to consumers were gone.

Spanish doesn't say something like "Fun Day", instead they say "Día Divertido", which is essentially backwards from how English speakers would say it. There are better examples, but this is just one.
I personally like the dollar sign in front of the amount, it allows me to know what the type of unit is before the amount.

Coinbase charges a fee of 1% per buy and sell, so you could convert it all for a total of a 2% fee.
I did a bit of research, and in conversions you can get Euros varying from $1.32 to $1.50, which is a variance of 18 cents, or about 8%. Some ATMs even charge 2-3.7%, but they have a maximum limit. 
If you can find an exchange that pays out in Euros, the conversion seems to be really easy over Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-11 21:56:25
They only need the Email address and then they can send the money to their own wallet. I could literally get it out of Coinbase in less than a minute using only an Email address.

That's fucking insane. I live in Minneapolis and I would have taken it and been like "K thanks".

@_date: 2014-06-12 00:12:16
Actually, that's not a bad idea. Give them $5 cash for letting me set up the account and send the BTC to myself?
@_date: 2014-04-09 17:52:59
Or launder them over time in a BTC Gambling site to wash them. Bitcoins are put in and come out to a new address.

Wait, I thought you killed yourself or something in that news story! WHAT IS HAPPENING?
@_date: 2014-06-12 03:16:13
I'd gladly give them $10 then, because that would be like 0.005BTC at most.
I did the math myself and other people have done this, but the maximum value for a Bitcoin if the entire world were to use it is above $3.3 Million. That $10 now would be worth $66,000. Its extremely unlikely to happen, but if even $60 Billion were processed every day with bitcoin, the price of a bitcoin would be $100,000. 
The way I see it, it wouldn't hurt to even buy like $10 worth and forget about it for a few years. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 02:54:06
Remove the ability for massive ASICs to be made for the algorithm, create a large P2Pool network, and keep it strictly GPU/Gridseed mined which allows more people to contribute to the hashrate.
Also, the community is really nice and supportive of all this decentralization, so that adds quite a bit of security. I'd suggest checking it out, its gaining in popularity and value as of late.
@_date: 2014-06-12 03:03:33
I posted the Coinbase thing on Facebook, 2 or 3 applied and got the coin, and another dude tried but his University wasn't on the list for the Coinbase promotion, which sucks. 
A lot of people are interested in it but not enough so to actively pursue it because they don't see any problem with the current banking systems and Federal Reserve. One of my coworkers was complaining about his bank charging him a $75 overdraft fee, so I told him about bitcoin and he was interested. Not enough so to switch now, but if it became more popular I have a feeling he would definitely try it out.
@_date: 2014-05-30 21:14:05
I tried to get a friend to go use his umn.edu email on Coinbase for a free $10 of bitcoin, he didn't want it.

I just looked it up, it depends on the carat, with higher carats being more malleable. I assume that they would make coins out of something lower carat because you handle them, so it would probably be harder to bend than lead. A scratch test could also reveal some info, but its hard to tell.
@_date: 2014-03-15 22:27:39
Pretty much, I don't know a good way to describe it though. Is this idea possible or even a good idea? Ideally it would eventually become the Bitcoin Stick idea from Almost Human.

No, that's 15 seconds of putting an email address and password into Coinbase, and clicking the link in their Email. Bam, $10 of BTC in Coinbase. Its $10 of Bitcoin, not $10 of fiat FROM Bitcoin.
If they want to do a purchase they can also just send the money from Coinbase without ever needing to create a wallet.
Setting up a wallet for full use takes slightly longer due to syncing, but we can still DL a wallet for them, slap it onto a flash drive, and then send the money from Coinbase to it in probably less than a minute.

Vertcoin itself is not a scamcoin, just one that stresses staying decentralized and will hard fork to avoid ASICs. VertPay recently went off the grid and is possibly where your buddy had issues, but Vertcoin still has some of the same problems that Bitcoin has.

The Fee is 2% for you, but because retailers are required to run credit card machines, the credit card companies also take 2-3% of all retail sales which means the store will charge 2-3% more in total in order to recoup those losses.
You're paying 5% extra on everything you buy. Congratulations.

I wanted to send a friend money I owe him for groceries, like $31 or so. Through using Western Union transfers in US Bank there is a $5 flat fee and using PopMoney or whatever there were other fees.

@_date: 2014-06-12 02:27:47
Holy shit, I don't even know where you're going with this, but I'm done on it.
A bit of googling would show that the $10 could be put onto a Gyft gift card for anything, lets say Papa John's, and we could be eating Pizza in like 15 minutes. A short ride away, I just found out that a local liquor store takes it.
I could pool half a dozen friends and go out drinking and eating pizza all thanks to Coinbase, and that would be really awesome.
@_date: 2014-06-12 01:04:11

@_date: 2014-06-12 03:20:59
I feel like people are still passing up at the moment because they don't see any immediate need for it and the average person doesn't have a severe interest in economics or technology.
He would be unable to make the purchase if he held insufficient funds in his Bitcoin wallet. So instead of being unable to make the purchase and being charged extra, he would see that he would be unable to make the purchase outright.

An ETF will not peg the value to a specific amount, and can only help spread adoption. Gold has ETFs, but Bitcoin has none of the physical limitations of gold, that prevent gold from being used as a currency. 
Bitcoin already works as a currency if you're fine with the transaction times and fees. Merchant acceptance is the primarily limitation. Besides, Bitcoin is fundamentally a combination between currency and commodity, much like gold; if you thought it was a currency this whole time, you've been on the wrong boat.
@_date: 2018-07-28 07:27:31
I can't send an ounce of gold to the other side of the world in less than 60 minutes, but I can send a Bitcoin in 6 block confirmations. Supply of Bitcoin is limited like gold, but Bitcoin is much more easily transferable.
Ergo, with a limited supply, Bitcoin fills market dynamics that make it a commodity, while also having the fundamentals of a currency.
I feel like if you understood anything about Bitcoin, ETFs, or Commodities though, you wouldn't have even made this thread to begin with, but good on you for asking questions.

Yeah, the same thing happened during the $1000 BTC price spike a few years ago, Alt-Coins were surging and then fell down after the initial bull-rush for Bitcoin ended. 
Then it was stagnant for a few years, and now we're seeing another bull trend for Bitcoin, probably due to the halving. Hopefully this one doesn't end due to another collapse like Mt.Gox.

I did the Blockchain and Transaction reset on the wallet, and now the 0.05BTC Transaction has disappeared entirely. I'm 0.05BTC short on my total balance and there's no record that it was sent. Do I just have to wait for this shit to finally process, or did I just lose 5 cents due to a shitty transaction fee?

Benefit of GPUs is that they're multi-purpose, and different algorithms can be processed. I personally would never buy an ASIC to mine coins, because if the profitability of lets say, Scrypt-based coins goes to zero, I can't repurpose the equipment I purchased for a different coin.
