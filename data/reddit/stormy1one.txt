I like the idea, and have been building things out manually for a while now.  Names, linkedin prof, GitHub prof, twitter etc.     Once I get enough data collected, I'm hoping to graph the network together and make it available to everyone.

Something is wrong with the title of this post.  Eventual != soon.

Someone should make a Reddit bot that counts how many times a "dude should I invest" post occurs within a 24 hour period.  Take that number and compare to the rolling monthly average.   When this value hits a new 6 month max, it is time to cash out.  Fuck me.

This should be the top comment.

Good information, upvoted.

This, a thousand times this.  Far too many people look at the fiat return on paper/screen and simultaneously curse fiat when at the end of the day, it is realized profit in fiat that matters when you finally cash out.

Was just going to post the same thing.  Whatever they are doing, it is working - I haven’t had an API error in days.  Unfortunately there is a shit ton more competition now.

I don't know of anything that delivers in xls, but the best I have found thus far is pulling prices direct from a given exchange via ccxt:
It's fairly easy to manipulate the output if you have some JS or Python experience.

Don't want to come off as snarky, but don't you think $25k is a bit much for your first transfer?  I would have tested out with $100 or $1000 first.  Especially if you are new to token trading/investing

Actually, this site appears to have exactly what you want - I just downloaded the entire 1m history from bitfinex in csv format from 2013-2017:

Open a Gemini account.  You can then put the coins up on auction there.

Most merchants would charge a service fee that may buffer the price 5-15% higher when paying by bitcoin. This may even happen behind the scenes, via their payment gateway. Until fiat is no longer needed, and BTC becomes less volatile, there is little else a business owner can do, aside from accepting volatility risk itself.

Wtf, you kept your life savings of ~150k USD on an exchange, and btc-e of all places? Seriously now...why?
@_date: 2017-06-27 09:15:16
 BTC, obviously
ETH, well off the high
NMR, entirely self financed, no ICO and fully functioning product
ZEC and XMR,  top privacy plays 
I also am looking at SIA and MYST.

The solution is to move on from GDAX for now.  I had the same issue and opened accounts on Kraken and Gemini plus a few smaller exchanges.  Not worth the effort to push when there are a few suitable alternatives

Have an upvote cuz this post honestly is the craziest thing I have read all day.
