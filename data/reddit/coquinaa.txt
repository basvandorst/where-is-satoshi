Come over to r/conspiracy for a different take... 
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:11:06
Controlled by the alt-coins... 
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:01:14
Bingo. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:18:43
Didnt realize divulge is a “smart” word. Maybe you should learn some more vocab  
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:54:23
Ill probably get rid of it within a month or two. I honestly dont know shit about cryptos but have been watching the price of BTC since Oct. i told myself id buy some only if it went below 10K. Lowest I bought was 9.3, so once I make a quick buck ill pull out and invest in Robinhood.

Right, so divulge, which means to make something known, which is otherwise secretive. Aka, I used it in the right context.

@_date: 2018-01-11 16:07:09
I divulge you 
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:31:20
As did I. My first buy. Been waiting for the right time. Fingers crossed
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:28:47
And you DoNt KnOw how  TO cApitAlIze 
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:33:53
Bitcoin its self is a conspiracy, and its right in front of you!  
deregulated currency, that has no backing by any government, and is in the hands of the people?! Hello

username checks out 
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:00:53
r/digging? 
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:27:27
Its okay, we wont miss you. When you divulge into topics objectively, and see through the propaganda and agendas of special interest groups that rule your daily life without you even realizing, then maybe you will be able to join us. 
But until then, let the psychological warfare that has bestowed upon you continue. Good luck

The gravity of the moon? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:18:30
Obviously not cuz the whole video talks about how it didnt crash lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:48:14
As was my response 
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:18:36
For what? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:08:26
I honestly agree with you on this. Its just high risk/high reward gambling. They like bitcoin, I like NFL spreads. They both give the same adrenaline rush that comes with the chance of making a lot of money.  
@_date: 2018-08-27 21:20:11
Needs volume to go anywhere 
@_date: 2018-08-11 19:53:38
Shoulda taken some profit bro
@_date: 2018-08-12 02:08:12
F the moon. Id take the stratosphere 
@_date: 2019-10-12 21:24:39
Wait we arent supposed to just HODL anymore
@_date: 2019-10-12 21:26:34
Why would you just read the book? Whats the point of cracking it?
@_date: 2019-04-09 01:46:15
Bull market? This thing was due for a pop after consolidation. Now lets see how many bag holders are waiting to jump ship..
@_date: 2019-04-09 03:23:56
A lil TA goes a long way. Look at price and volume, demand&gt;supply, price will fly. But the price needs to hold now and re-consolidate if it wants higher.
@_date: 2018-11-15 02:14:04
Thats their fault for chasing. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 13:32:09
“Basically identical” is different then both parties are corrupt. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:24:55
Its like one is a rock solid poo, and the other is liquid diarrhea ( you can guess which is which) but at the end of the day, they both shit. 
@_date: 2019-09-28 21:13:55
Right like what.
@_date: 2019-09-28 21:52:20
Yep exactly. Just a way to tell who actually knows something. And  someone who thinks they know
