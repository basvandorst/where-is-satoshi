Yes, Shapeshift's service is good.
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:36:59
Hi Bitstamp, you should stop using BitGo at least!
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:32:12
Not only BFX kids.
There are so many companies and peoples believed that BitGo's Multisig solution is 100% secured.
So they all are kids.
@_date: 2016-08-07 15:41:18
They used to have cold storage before integrating with BitGo.
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:28:46
A company called  ?
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:04:11
Currently we all know there are investigation of Bitfinex, but BitGo?
Did the police lock down all BitGo's servers and employees' computers?
Were there any suspicious activities of these BitGo guys?
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:06:36
@_date: 2016-08-07 06:01:55
Yes, 
@_date: 2016-08-16 01:22:52
Totally agree, except the CFTC part.
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:39:32
Bitfinex was cheated by BitGo's solution.
@_date: 2016-08-07 02:32:13
But still, knowing how to send out 120,000 bitcoins without triggering any BitGo's alarms?
He must have detailed understanding on how BitGo's security architecture operates without having to breach into BitGo's system.
@_date: 2016-08-07 15:39:38
Who are you? Another BitGo guy registered for 12 days?
@_date: 2016-08-07 08:09:41
If we have security experts examine the Bitfinex/BitGo's servers and every employees computers, we may find out who did this inside job. Does that mean nothing?
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:17:10
So you know?
Knowing your boss is paying you money to come here and tell people that your boss is liable?
Again, 
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:32:53
You can store them on BitGo, and they will be Gone soon.
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:17:21
Stop using BitGo.
All  guys should go to jail.
@_date: 2016-08-07 06:37:16
At least we know police was involved in Bitfinex from their PR.
How about BitGo, just like nothing happened?
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:54:16
"not really their fault"? How stupid you are?
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:39:01
So finally they added some security policies after the Bitfinex heist?
@_date: 2016-08-07 04:58:03
So what?
The remove policy API should be worked too? Can you be a little funnier?
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:14:17
Government tell you to eat **SHIT**, so you eat **SHIT**?
The Bitfinex incident had nothing related to CFTC, because CFTC did not ask them to put all bitcoins in hot wallet. 
Actually Bitgo and Bitfinex chose this solution together.
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:42:36
Did the police check BitGo's servers and employees' computers?
If all jobs should be done by Bitfinex, why using BitGo? Only use them for automatically signing 120,000 bitcoins out?
@_date: 2016-08-07 14:17:27
Hi BitGo guy, nice to meet you again. You are working so hard for your boss, and he must pay you a lot.
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:11:03
Hi idiot,
The protection of your bitcoin comes from Multisig, not BitGo.
You should post your BitGo's API key to prove BitGo's safety.
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:28:54
Good for you and all your family members. 
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:49:11
If you are preparing the legal case, you should try to include the BitGo (a VC backed company).
Because they have a least half of the responsibilities for the Bitfinex Breach, and they may have the ability to bear some money too.
@_date: 2016-08-07 16:51:31
Again 
@_date: 2016-08-07 08:38:27
BitGo and the police : Where are they?
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:02:15


@_date: 2016-08-06 15:14:17
Actually they were putting bitcoins mainly in "Industry leading multi-sig" with enhanced security policies provided by BitGo, and they thought it was unbreakable.
So that does not mean they are lying on Hot wallet.
They were just fooled by BitGo.
So again 
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:54:54
Take care!
There are so many Bitgo guys here, and they may bite you.
@_date: 2016-08-04 08:32:21
What a stupid question?
Do you know the history of blockchain.info?
@_date: 2016-08-10 11:59:29
BitGo - 100% SECURE
How they still have it on their front page?

@_date: 2016-08-05 01:31:04
Every Bitfinex user has a related BitGo account, and all hacking transactions have been signed by BitGo. So..........
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:50:16
After hacking into Bitfinex's system, the hacker may know how Bitfinex operates.
But without the knowledge of BitGo's system, how can he know which kind of the transactions will be ok with the BitGo's security policies?
If he directly sent all bitcoins to his addresses without the tiny change to a multisig address. It may trigger the alarm, and there will be no hacking story.
@_date: 2016-08-07 06:34:51
I want this statement too, and I think police should be engaged in both sides, Bitfinex and BitGo.
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:43:17
Yes, it will change things.
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:40:28
Actually, you are the negative one to the community, BitGo guy.

@_date: 2016-08-12 15:22:56
Does opendime need tools?
@_date: 2016-08-07 04:53:28
With this logic, this guy can just post any bitcoin address and prove BitGo is safe too.
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:43:23
Not only
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:27:41
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:54:35
If it was an inside job, the police should catch him.
@_date: 2016-08-07 04:51:23
What a moron?
Multisig is Multisig, and BitGo is BitGone. Multisig is safe does not means BitGo is safe.
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:02:25
@_date: 2016-08-04 06:22:45
I think Bitgo should be responsible for a least half of the loss.
@_date: 2016-08-08 08:12:55
definitely yes
@_date: 2016-08-07 06:46:13

@_date: 2016-08-04 10:30:39
Another Bitgo guy? 
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:35:18
Because they are cheater! 
@_date: 2016-08-13 01:15:06
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:42:32
Where did you get that?
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:54:12
Yes, liars do that!
@_date: 2016-08-07 07:50:55
me too.
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:17:46
So you should keep your system from being compromised, then what is BitGo's role here?
A nothing related third party?
@_date: 2016-08-07 05:18:24
Using Multisig to prove BitGo's safety. Good one!
@_date: 2016-08-06 10:01:42
No, they didn't.
It was BitGo convinced Bitfinex that the door is 100% secured.
So again 
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:33:46
What is wrong with you?

BitGo guys, you are doing excellent jobs on reddit.
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:06:21
As they have removed all of their insurance pages, there must be something that they are trying to hide.

@_date: 2015-06-12 08:38:54
legit but stupid.
@_date: 2015-06-16 07:07:31
I think correcting this description and eliminating the misleading is important.
Other developers should know that if you use some codes from Mycelium, you may break the license.
@_date: 2015-06-16 10:07:36
Do you mean that we should accept your definition of "OPEN SOURCE"?
What's the difference between Open-source licenses and Restricted licenses?

Who is trying to redefine the words? YOU?
@_date: 2015-06-16 07:28:55
@_date: 2015-06-16 11:01:27
Who is confusing? Wiki or Mycelium?
@_date: 2015-06-24 03:40:22
Hard fork is stupid.
@_date: 2015-06-16 15:55:23
@_date: 2015-06-16 11:48:23
So stop telling people they are not open source, is this your point?
@_date: 2015-06-16 11:33:19
"Choosing any kind of licenses" is ok, it's all your rights. But "choosing a restricted license and telling people it is open source license" is not ok, you should stop doing that.
@_date: 2015-06-12 09:18:15
@_date: 2015-06-17 09:24:18
Do we have any data about this?

Why is MS-RSL (Microsoft reference source license) not considered an open source license?
Because an individual may only look at the source code. It may not be redistributed or modified.
@_date: 2015-06-25 10:06:52
Do you live in an ideal world?
@_date: 2015-06-16 07:01:48
Not an open source license. So they should correct their description on bitcoin.org.
I think it is ok to pointing out this.
What's your problem?
@_date: 2015-06-16 05:27:09
Also I found the developers of Mycelium had closed this issue : 
Why did they close an unresolved issue?
@_date: 2015-06-24 04:54:33
What is this about?
@_date: 2015-06-16 15:58:54
So I think "not using the word open source" hurts you a lot?
@_date: 2015-06-25 10:20:32
Do the community really have this **DEFINITION**?
@_date: 2015-06-05 08:30:47

How safe depends on how you use it.

@_date: 2015-06-25 10:05:41
How about I make a new bitcoin-gandalf, and this bitcoin-gandalf is compatible with the bitcoin-core up to a certain point (block). After that, they will become two different chains.
And, will you call my bitcoin-gandalf "BITCOIN" too?
@_date: 2015-06-16 15:55:48
@_date: 2015-06-16 06:50:36
Actually, MS-RSL is a restricted shared source license, not open source.
@_date: 2015-06-16 05:33:40
totally agree!
@_date: 2015-06-18 05:51:53
Does Gavin really have the power to do this?
@_date: 2015-06-24 06:30:23
Yeah, right.
@_date: 2015-06-17 06:08:10
So what?
@_date: 2015-06-16 05:58:34
I am talking about wether it is open source. Not about wether it is good enough for someone.
@_date: 2015-06-24 02:31:28
Maybe QR Code is a good idea.
@_date: 2015-06-16 07:59:10
The head of the block!
@_date: 2015-06-16 09:04:38
If you are not open source, the only thing you need to do is "just remove it".
@_date: 2015-06-16 11:42:44
MS-PL and MS-RL are open source licenses.
MS-RSL, MS-LPL and MS-LRL are not, they are restricted licenses, and MS-RSL is the most restrictive one of the Microsoft Shared Source licenses.
@_date: 2015-06-23 03:19:42
Then, why are you using Circle?
@_date: 2015-06-16 07:58:26
Thanks for your response.
@_date: 2015-06-16 11:51:23
So you call it "open source", and everyone should call it "open source" too?
I think you should try to modify the wiki and persuade some open source groups first.
@_date: 2015-06-18 11:46:38
@_date: 2015-06-25 06:25:44
lol, you must be a good reader.
@_date: 2015-06-17 02:35:30
MS-RSL, the most restricted one.
@_date: 2015-06-03 07:58:33
who knows!!!
@_date: 2015-06-24 06:44:14
A way to **CLOSE** an address is an **EVIL** idea.
@_date: 2015-05-30 18:09:47
* Yes, we haven't seen a single device without /dev/urandom. But as the BC.i's codes, this event has occurred for hundreds of times, otherwise the address 1Bn9 will never come out.
* Yes, the new commit of bitcoinj have fixed this. But the old version will still use Android SecureRandom in rare circumstances.
* BC.i's issue is generating the same address, so it's easy to find out. But if we use low entropy Android SecureRandom, it maybe difficult for users to find out, and they may know nothing about what happened even when they lose their bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-05-29 07:13:08
Who told you that the OS could not provide enough entropy?
It's their own bugs, nothing is wrong with Android's /dev/urandom.
@_date: 2015-05-29 10:12:24
It's nothing related to the Android versions.
@_date: 2015-05-29 10:57:43
Thanks to whom? BC.i?
@_date: 2015-05-29 06:45:03
Does this means you can get this address "1Bn9ReEocMG1WEW1qYjuDrdFzEFFDCq43F"?
@_date: 2015-05-29 14:28:50
@_date: 2015-05-29 06:41:52

@_date: 2015-05-29 07:14:34
I just submitted an issue on their github :
 
@_date: 2015-05-31 06:39:38
This guy lost 9.6301 BTC and could not find the reason.
I think maybe this is it!
@_date: 2015-05-29 06:48:41
I see.
@_date: 2015-05-30 18:12:59
BC.i's problem is generating the same address.
But if this issue happens on other wallets (which have not throw exception when unable to access /dev/urandom), they may use Android low entropy SecureRandom. This will definitely generate different addresses, but still these addresses are in danger.
@_date: 2015-05-29 10:52:30
Their wallet is popular, but their source code is not.
@_date: 2015-05-29 07:00:54
Not your money, so not a big deal.
@_date: 2015-05-29 09:51:00
HD wallet does not help in this situation.
If the PRNG is wrong, all HD keys will be compromised too!
@_date: 2015-05-29 06:24:30
I have checked their latest two github commits:
It was their **BUGS** on PRNG again!
In their blog, they said "certain versions of Android operating system could fail to provide sufficient entropy", but the actual reason is their own RandomOrgGenerator. So, WTF is this RandomOrgGenerator?
@_date: 2015-05-30 07:31:11
One more question:
Why there are no issue options on bitcoinj's github?
@_date: 2015-05-29 08:37:32
If this issue happens on HD wallets, all keys will be compromised.
@_date: 2015-05-30 18:16:46

What's the matter with you?
@_date: 2015-05-29 08:10:17
If the /dev/urandom is inaccessible, telling users that you cannot generate private keys is better than giving users 1Bn9R address.

@_date: 2015-07-06 13:25:06
You must love shit too!
@_date: 2015-07-06 07:28:25
Have you read your own about page?
@_date: 2015-07-04 15:04:54
fucked by the bankers or by the government?
@_date: 2015-07-06 05:13:00
Yes, they modified some pages, and the situation has improved.
But still, many people may still think the bitcoin.com is the "OFFICIAL" bitcoin site.
We should tell people that "The bitcoin.com is Roger Ver's personal commercial site".
@_date: 2015-07-10 09:12:21
[Can you tell me who owns [3JmdHRuTDuFTqxk7bFazY6GooNgwohZQwa]( and [3Fq28aWZf5SCF6VbhPZf9X33XPGS833mKS](
Also, could you provide a detail report about how you returned lost bitcoins?
@_date: 2015-07-06 12:18:51
This is why we should take care of Roger and his products.
@_date: 2015-07-09 08:58:25
Why did bc.i do this?
@_date: 2015-07-06 04:15:35
@_date: 2015-07-06 03:49:38
me too!
@_date: 2015-07-09 09:14:19
So the 2nd transaction showed up in your bc.i's wallet, and dispeared later?
@_date: 2015-07-04 06:17:18
@_date: 2015-07-01 08:19:56
Yes **PIIGS**
@_date: 2015-07-06 04:07:50
I am.
But still many people may be fooled by this bitcoin.com!
@_date: 2015-07-10 08:58:14
[1PLn3ru1n7wERPP1BLVV9oAEGGuXUP1eoC]( is one of the BC.i's addresses used for returning the bitcoins to their users.
On Dec. 2014, the transactions of this address seemed ok that they were returning the money. But after that, there were still hundreds of bitcoins lefted on this address.
On Apr.10, 2015, they sent 189 BTC to [1pTCitt4FVDfSFXhRe1eMu37XgSDi8925]( and then [31uqKHBYThXcPSoS4nG8tSDbTbjiHdq7kL](
After that, these money were splitted identically (94.75757823 BTC) to [two addresses]( And the transactions of these two addresses seemed nothing related to returning the users' money. Currently there are about 100 BTC lefted on these two addresses.
So my question is : Who owns these addresses. Did Blockchain.info use these lost money on their own purpose?
@_date: 2015-07-29 04:09:46
I like their service too.
Shapeshift.io +1
@_date: 2015-07-08 08:59:23
If you want the storage on blockchain, you should pay for it.
@_date: 2015-08-05 09:43:48
**NO FEES**
@_date: 2015-07-20 04:58:52
@_date: 2015-07-06 06:52:54
After all these years, why are you still using the blockchain.info?
@_date: 2019-12-19 07:20:30
@_date: 2015-07-07 04:08:20
Great site and nice job!
Much better than Roger Ver's bitcoin.com. LoL
@_date: 2015-07-03 09:00:38
try localbitcoins
@_date: 2015-07-09 09:27:11
If it hasn't shown at all, that maybe a different issue.
You should try to contact the ATM provider.
@_date: 2015-07-10 03:30:04
shapeshift is awesome!
@_date: 2015-07-09 08:59:01
Which one?
@_date: 2015-07-04 04:24:41
So you guys planned BIP66 and the version 3 blocks, but did not anticipate this happening?
@_date: 2016-02-01 07:05:00
Ethereum is good at producing **SHIT**!
@_date: 2015-07-06 03:58:54
Say goodbye to blockchain.info !
@_date: 2015-07-06 12:15:35
You call this decentralization? Can you be a little funnier?
@_date: 2015-07-06 04:28:36
Bitcoin cannot help the world's unbanked. But it can help you unbanked.
@_date: 2015-07-06 07:57:25
You are sponsored, so others must be sponsored too?
You are dirty, so others must be dirty too?
@_date: 2015-07-10 14:46:28
Thanks for your reply.
How about others? And how about the lefted money?
@_date: 2015-07-26 06:28:51
@_date: 2015-07-03 08:53:47
Where are you?
@_date: 2016-09-23 01:30:56
Time for BitGo to sign away 120,000 bitcoins: 2 milliseconds?
@_date: 2019-01-19 02:19:29
Although imToken is mainly an Ethereum wallet, they provide bitcoin wallet service too.
You mean in , we should never talk about a bitcoin wallet's Open-source policy?
@_date: 2015-09-01 08:43:42
Bitcoin is money. Money should store transaction informations.
This is ok.
But why should money store **ANY** arbitrary informations, does the money really need this function?
@_date: 2015-09-01 09:27:14
"prune by a particular person, but exist in the whole blockchain", that's what we should do to **SHIT**?
@_date: 2015-09-01 09:03:30
Yes, people can do that, but still address/hash160 is address.
People can use many different ways to generate their own addresses, but still they are no more than addresses, and they are not some guy's arbitrary informations stored in an extra data structure called OP_RETURN.
@_date: 2015-09-21 06:45:01
EPA, ATF, FCC ......
@_date: 2015-09-02 07:43:49
Should I voluntarily surrender myself? To whom?
@_date: 2015-09-12 04:15:51
Stupid people make stupid mistakes.
@_date: 2015-09-01 09:17:08
pruned by whom?
@_date: 2015-09-02 07:45:48
Where is the sergeant? Can you tell me?
@_date: 2015-09-12 09:37:44
Why are you still using the blockchain.info?
**STUPID** ?
@_date: 2015-09-02 07:11:11
So you guys are arguing about this **BitLicense** every day, but nobody knows wether it is legal?
@_date: 2015-09-17 03:23:52
@_date: 2015-09-01 08:29:04
Bitcoin is money.
Why should money provide supports to something like Counterparty? Is the Counterparty Better than **SHIT**?
@_date: 2015-09-01 08:45:12
Yes, you can write any thing you want in OP_RETURN.
@_date: 2015-09-01 08:35:02
Then why calling it **OP_RETURN**? Why not **OP_SHIT**?
Why Bitcoin needs this structure to store shit? Can Bitcoin live without shit?
@_date: 2015-09-16 08:53:06
Rejoice for what? For your stupidness?
@_date: 2015-09-21 06:22:30
@_date: 2015-09-20 03:47:40
Bitcoin.com is a **SCAM** site because of its behavior, not because of its look.
@_date: 2015-10-12 10:20:49
If Play store told you that there wasn't anything to upgrade, why Mycelium told you to upgrade?
@_date: 2015-10-06 05:44:48
Totally agree!
@_date: 2016-07-01 00:58:09
Again, good for them, and good for their families!
@_date: 2016-07-01 08:44:39
.... it's patented!
@_date: 2016-07-01 10:22:15
@_date: 2016-07-01 00:57:41
Its "own system"? Then they should implement it in their own software.
Why did they try to use this *SHIT* to ruin the bitcoin bips?
@_date: 2016-07-01 10:21:38
What's this?
