That's if you can figure out the bottom or the top. You don't know how much it's going to go down to. You could sell them a minute later it rises sharply, you lost your bet. Then when it starts to rise, you buy, then a minute later it falls sharply, lost again.
If you held and just waited till it recovered then you wouldn't lose anything.
