I am in awe how sophisticated scam artists have acquired skills to draw people to join an old Ponzi scheme using buzzwords such as cryptocurrency and mining.  For those who do not know about cryptocurrencies, they are decentralized by nature.  Anything centralized is NOT a cryptocurrency.  Being decentralized also means the source code must be available (open source) so anyone may view, audit and use the code.  One coin falls short of this as there is no technical specifications, nor any source code, to inspect what it is.
Also, OneCoin education is teaching how to recruit people into a pyramid scheme (aka Ponzi scheme).  Charles Ponzi sincerely believed his new business model would create wealth around the world and was planning of opening Ponzi branches all over the world. As for the economics of OneCoin, it is fundamentally flawed.  Doubling the number of coins or tokens does not double the wealth - it is just in-house inflation.  One greate feature of Bitcoin and other alt-currencies (I do not consider OneCoin being an alt-currency) is they have a fixed supply.  The quantity of units is not important as they may be divided to infinity.  A quick fix in the Bitcoin protocol would enable to trade pico Bitcoin.  People would price their goods and services in micro Bitcoin without a problem.
OneCoin does not produce anything of value: it is transferring wealth from people at the bottom of the pyramid to people at the top of the pyramid. There is not a single cryptocurrency exchange I am aware which is trading OneCoin.  This is a big red flag. In contrast, Bitcoin is a public ledger payment system which is decentralized. Decentralization is huge as it enables people to create new Bitcoin services and exchanges.  Centralization, as it is the case of OneCoin, means if their website is shut down or the key operators of OneCoin are arrested and jailed for running a Ponzi scheme, then you lose everything you put into OneCoin.
What I find fascinating is how the split of OneCoin is crafted to incentive people to keep their assets in OneCoin, waiting for the next split.  In the end, every Ponzi scheme collapses, creating massive losses to those who joined late while making fortunes to the early joiners and of course, the founder(s) of OneCoin.

Giving coins away does not make people interested... unless they were interested before receiving them.  One of my favorite quote is: "What one obtains easily, he/she esteems lightly".  If you give free Bitcoins, then they have little value to the recipient.  The same as giving equity or share or a percentage of your business to a friend or employee working with you. In the eye of your friend, you are giving something worthless.  The best way is to pay your friend or employee, and offer the option to buy a percentage of the business at a "market" price.  If the friend or employee prefers the money to the shares, then you got your answer: he is not interested in owning equity.
My recommendation is to mention Bitcoins as often as you can. Some will be very interested and some won't.  You spend your time educating those interested and don't waste your time with those not interested.

Kidnapping is due to poverty and the lack of free market, especially in the area of private security.  For instance, if citizens were allowed to purchase insurance against kidnapping, it would be very risky to kidnap someone, however at the moment, only the police which is lazy, incompetent and/or corrupt handles those cases, which makes kidnapping a profitable risk-free business.  One may argue that not everyone may afford a kidnapping insurance, however just the looming risk of kidnapping someone insured would significantly reduce the risks.  Besides, such an insurance would be rather cheap because the probability of being kidnapped is a rare event.

This is was my suggesiton as well.  Each account can have 10 orders max, or pay a larger transaction fee.  This way, someone wishing to sell 0.001 BTC only once (to do an experiment) can do it, however cannot abuse the system.  My first Bitcoin transaction was 0.000005 BTC and I was happy it worked.  I clicked on an advertising and entered my Bitcoin address and got my 0.000005 BTC the next day.  This event was amazing how it was possible to send a micro-transaction.  On the other hand, someone flooding the network with micro-transactions should not be allowed.

I agree. Short selling would provide a great social function to the Bitcoin community, as it would stabilize the prices when people cover their shorts when the price are falling.

If Bitcoin captures only 0.5% of the world economy and only 15% of all Bitcoins are used for transactions (meaning 85% of Bitcoins are used as a store of value, or investment or speculation), then each Bitcoin is worth $124,561.

I agree. Diversity does not mean having a bunch of similar clones as it is the case of BTC and LTC.

The Bitcoin market is young and there will be bumps (holes) along the road.  Some exchanges will be hacked while others will have their bank accounts closed, forcing them to close.  Likewise, some wallets (online and offline) will have security flaws resulting in a loss of Bitcoins.

@_date: 2013-04-04 11:35:40
The State cannot steal what it cannot find.  For instance, use TrueCrypt to encrypt your computer.  That is a start.
A wallet is a very small file which may be stored anywhere. The other thing is you may store your wallet on a flash disk, or a CD ROM, or online on the "cloud".  You can encrypt your wallet too, and when you store your file, you give the file a meaningless name.  You don't store your file as "My Bitcoin Wallet containing 10,000 BTC".
Besides, the State loves centralization to harvest wealth from its slaves.  Going after each wallet is like searching every house for "pirated" music CDs.  Theft will continue as long as the benefits (profits) outweigh its cost.  In the case of Cyprus, with a stroke of a pen the State managed to steal billions.

In my experience, it takes from 2 to 10 seconds to see the transaction, however you have to wait about one hour to be able to spend those Bitcoins (the norm is to wait for 6 confirmations, and each confirmation takes about 10 minutes).  This is like depositing a check at the bank: the moment you make the deposit, you see a transaction reporting the deposit, however you have to wait a few days for the check to clear.
If you trust the party sending you the Bitcoins, then you do not need to wait for the 6 confirmations.  The same analogy is having a trusted friend writing you a check... you "know" the funds will be there and the check won't bounce.

Unfortunately Bitcoin is too secure to be purchased via PayPal or Credit Cards.  The problem is chargebacks (or fraudulent transactions) with PayPal and Credit Cards.  You may have better luck with Debit Cards for purchasing Bitcoins.  If you are in the US, you may use Coinbase.com which supports ACH transfer directly from you bank account.

I am trying to contact "zeroday", the guy who got 700k stolen.  I registered with bitcointalk.org, however I am unable to send any message to him from this website.  Any suggestion?  Thanks.

I hope Stefan was not using InstantWallet which was recommended to him.

I got the same too... just remove the www from the address.  Type  and it will work.

I thought Max Keiser was smarter than this and had some understanding of basic economic theories, such as demand and supply.

In 2013, about 1.375 million Bitcoins will be mined.  This represent about a  12% increase of Bitcoins in circulation, thus 12% inflation (my definition of inflation is the increase of the money supply).  The great news is this value will be lower and lower each year, and as inflation will continue to decrease, the value of Bitcoin will continue to rise.

All is needed to stand up to a violent institution is not giving them power.  It is like a fire: stop feeding it and it will die.
Keeping money in Bitcoin, and better, trading in Bitcoin, is a great way to reduce the power of the established institutions.  After all, the government/banks may inflate only money you hold in their currency.
Instead of asking for regulations from the government, people should have a mechanism to resolve their disputes.  An example is 
I also believe voting is giving power and legitimacy to the government.

I agree this is not a good article, however any "publicity" about Bitcoin makes people more aware of Bitcoin.  When an individuals hears about Bitcoin on MSN, CNN, Fox, WSJ and other mass-~~propaganda~~ media, then he/she will start to consider Bitcoin as important.

Are you being sarcastic when you write "I am sure this will annihilate recession"?
If the ECB was serious, they should raise the interest rates in double-digits.  What the ECB needs is another Paul Volcker.

I agree with you, however having Unicef accepting Bitcoin donations would improve the recognition and visibility of Bitcoin.  I will not write what I think about the UN, because do not want to be banned from Reddit.

I like your idea... not because I want to give money to politicians, however as an "insurance" against going after Bitcoins.  I a agree with you: if a politician accepts donations in Bitcoins, he will be more likely to defend Bitcoins as a legitimate form of payment rather than a medium of exchange for crooks and criminals.

I few month ago, I visited the Mises Institute.  I spent over a week there to chat with people, including people on the "board". To my pleasure, many were open to the idea of Bitcoin, and many had prior favorable discussions regarding the adoption of Bitcoin.   I am just surprised the Mises Institute has published so many articles against Bitcoin.

"use money to make money" still apply in the sense one needs capital to create a business.  Even the case of developing a website requires capital (savings) to feed yourself while developing the website.  Creating a small business, such as selling fruits on the side of the road, or manufacturing something, still requires some capital.  Those having absolutely zero savings must work for someone else by selling their labor in exchange of money.

Maybe the minimal "fee/donation" should be one Satoshi.  This is amount is very little, however if someone wishes to send one Satoshi, then he would have to pay a 100% fee to transfer the amount.  After all, I am not a fan of free riders or people who clog the network.  I do not mind people gambling, however I do not want gambling dumping their external costs on others who wishes to transact larger amounts.

By the way, money laundering is money earned from a criminal activity... mining Bitcoins is not a criminal activity.

Inflation is VERY BAD for the economy.  What we learn in school about money is pure brainwashing.  What is necessary for job creation jobs is capital accumulation through savings.  Inflation destroys savings.  If inflation was so good, then Zimbabwe would be the best country to live in the world.

Great.  During the weekend, we did the same.  The integration of Bitcoins took about one hour of work.  We are now accepting bitcoins and offering a 20% discount for bitcoins users.

Bitcoins would be great to show transparency in the Vatican finances.
