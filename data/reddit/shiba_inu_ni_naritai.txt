Your private keys are generated from the seed. Coins aren't actually stored on the wallet; they're stored on the blockchain. The "wallet" just holds the key to access them.
So if you factory reset your ledger or grab a new one and enter in your seed, it will generate the same key from that seed, and that key corresponds to the same wallet address where your coins are.
Likewise, for software wallet apps, you could take the private key from one wallet app, import it into another, and now both wallets are using the same key, the same wallet address, and showing the same coins.
You can think of it like creating a duplicate of your house key, and the seed is those numbers the locksmith uses to create a copy.

Uh, OP, just a heads up: we can still read every letter on that license plate.
Make sure you use a fully opaque brush to block stuff out, or better yet, use rectangles.

(Edit because I originally misread.)
This site makes a request to the bitpay url (after the `bitcoin:?r=`), so presumably any information bitpay gives back, this site could have access to. If you have an invoice link you don't mind testing with, open the dev tools, go to network, and try decoding it to see what the site makes requests to. In particular, see if it sends anything back to its own servers. You can also go to the url yourself or click on it in the dev tools to see what data bitpay is giving them.
Two other observations: 1) there is a heavy amount of obfuscated code on the site. Not normal minification. This has me a bit concerned, and it makes it hard to say what it really does without a url to test. 2) The code that is readable does not look quality.
I'd opt for something open source instead, just to be safe.

Sadly baseless speculation. Rakuten is a huge company; we've seen huge companies do similar crypto related things before, and it doesn't necessarily amount to anything. Yet time and time again articles like this with nothing better to report on jump on the hype train and assume that any move related to crypto must mean that [author's favorite coin] is going to moon in some way. (Note: the exchange they acquired supports a variety of coins, not just BTC like the title would imply.)
It would be great to see a company like Rakuten endorse crypto, but don't get your hopes up so quickly until we see an official statement, which this is not. And if/when they do accept Bitcoin, [based on the exchange's homepage]( they may just as likely accept ETH and The Coin That Must Not Be Named as well.


FTFY, ambcrypto

Considering those TI calculators had programming and USB communication capabilities, you could probably use one as a graphics card somehow. Or at least as a mining "rig".

I think the idea is the second phone is a stock ROM (no other apps, no facebook) and never goes online, so there's no malware and no chance of data escaping except over the wallet app's bluetooth interface, similar to a ledger.
Actually a really good idea. A lot of people already have an old phone laying around, so this is essentially a free hardware wallet solution.

Ping from New York to Tokyo is [217.789 ms]( Distance is [6,737 mi]( That would make the maximum speed to propagate around the world about [17% the speed of light](

For those who can't read Japanese, it's not just some of them; looks like every single book in this picture is about either bitcoin (ビットコイン) or blockchain (ブロックチェーン) or both.
Also the cute anime girl holding a giant bitcoin is saying, "What is 'bitcoin'?!" (ビットコインって、何なんだ？！). Underneath reads "now the easiest to understand bitcoin reference book / instruction manual" (いま一番わかりやすいビットコインの解説書).
Kinda disappointing; would have preferred it be a new crypto anime. I'm not sure what that'd be about, but I'd watch it. Bitcoin best girl.

Fair point. [Doing a traceroute]( on mandarake.co.jp, a packet from New York to Tokyo [would go through]( Denver ([1629 mi as the crow flies]( and San Jose (+ 928 mi) before [crossing the Pacific]( and reaching Tokyo (+ 5186 mi). Total distance would be closer to 7743 mi, with our packets flying at an average speed of 0.19c. But that traceroute actually only took 109 ms, [bookin' it at 0.38c.](
