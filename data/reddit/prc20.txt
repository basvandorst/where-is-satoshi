There also Confirmation Bias to take into account.

Not for the faint of heart that's for sure and makes trading fixed income and equities dull as a butter knife.

Never seems to be any rhyme or reason. Someone just decides to step in pushing volume up and with it the price. Blink and you miss it.

It was outright bought. Watched it play out in real time. Surprising even by today’s standards.

$1m sell wall just was destroyed on Binance in less than one minute.  How sentiment can turn.....

JP Morgan admits that BTC is a risk to its business. Is it me or has the penny begun to drop and the banks are now figuring out what all of this actually means?

Koreans are first out of the gate here in Asia and apparently they like what they’ve woken up to (at least for now).

This is actually an editorial and not news reporting. 
Moreover, it is an editorial written by two individuals from BIS (the Bank of International Settlements) which is commonly referred to as the Central Bank to the world's individual central banks. So, what's been written is a narrative that matches with what you'd expect from this sort of organization
Summary, in short - crypto is bad unless done via the banking system itself.

Whatever happened to having a modicum of perspective?
I am down massively on paper, but am also looking at the fact that it has been a single month (30 days) since it appeared as though all coins, BTC or alt, would only move higher. Lambo, moon and sticking it to the institutional man. 
Today, everyone is just turning on one another. There is certainly pain in the community and there are more than a fair share of people that entered the world of crypto at – only in retrospect – what we now see was ill timed. And it is very clear that there are ample opinions on what everyone should be doing. But again I cannot stress that it has been exactly one, single month. Sell, hodl, dollar cost average. Choices made by individuals are choices made from free will. At the very least, what everyone will agree upon is that volatility is pre-backed into these sorts of trades. It is the same in every market, albeit perhaps not to the same degree. Just look at the stock market today and you’ll see that the VIX hit 50 and a level not seen since 2015.
For those that are able, my opinion would be to be patient and wait until the dust settles. Give current market oscillation time to moderate. Give it all just another, single month.

And then it all went reverse trend. Important to add that bit.

That is actually a great question. I’d wager that in a decade’s time there will be case studies on that very question. Adoption has been very much at the individual level and at very different points of time during the development of btc. 
For me it was the “Banking on Bitcoin” documentary. I’m a finance guy by vocation and had a good understanding of money. But after watching that documentary I went full research mode and never looked back.

Agreed. There is a real risk for any trader, experienced or otherwise, during markets when volume is low. Sentiment can turn quickly, and with it prices. Question is, however, might volume decline even further?
