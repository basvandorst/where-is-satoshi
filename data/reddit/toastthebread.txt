The answer to your 2nd question is fungibility. You shouldn't be able to have your currency be censored for any reason. Let's say your coins get tagged 6 transactions back as being used in a drug transaction and the government wants those coins flagged. Now what you have is useless. The idea is every coin in an anonymous system has the same value as eachother.  This is very similar to cash.

It's because people on both subs are part of the "cult". I'm sure bch works better, they used tried and true scaling method(some consider it only a temporary fix), on top of that they don't have the transaction volume btc has. Idk how things are going to play out but neither this sub or the other is a great place for close to unbiased opinions.

The fact that it's a trustless peer to peer decentralized store of value/currency whatever you want to call it is why it is not just an "arbitrary internet token"  
The part that is arbitrary is the numbers associated with it. Coins are divisible. You aren't forced to buy a whole one. 
Fiat money is only as good as the government backing it. Which yeah we probably aren't going to see USD in our live times fall out of existance, but personally I do see value in not having to trust anyone or anything but yourself.

Realistically every is arguing about a coin with the least amount of tech compared to the ones that share the 10 spots. 
The people saying they won't be able to run full nodes won't be able to in a few years anyway if they can barely handle it now.
Everyone is fighting about how to fix an ultimately flawed system. Personally at this point there are better cryptos to use for commerce. All I care about anymore is that the bitcoin I have becomes a store of value and everyone else starts to agree and see it that way.

This is something I have been saying for awhile. If you are using coinbase WITH 2FA and holding when you deem not a lot of money, on top of you don't really understand ways to secure your own private keys this is your best option.  Now if you have purchased a lot, it's very worth it to sit down do some good reading and learn how to properly store your private keys yourself. Also always practice with a small amount till you understand what you are doing.

Lol shill. Yeah coinbase pays me to hype them. Sign up now for $10 off your first purchase!
edit:  First you have to understand that coinbase has to GET bitcoins from somewhere to be able to offer them to you, and coinbase doesn't exactly hold bitcoins for sale, they give you them at a price they can afford to get them at. Which is from other people setting prices (im assuming) on gdax. You are more than welcome to buy from localbitcoins (which im sure is higher than coinbase) or an atm (which is going to be more expensive than coinbase) or another online service.  Coinbase is a business and they offer gdax which allows 0 fee trades for makers.  We can keep throwing the word foolish back and forth but at the end of day you have more options. You aren't forced to use coinbases "buy now" option.

I have a bunch of twitter posts that beg to differ


Actually it's not random, It was the original scaling option (Again not one I'm for or against)


I'm being facetious bruh, Idk how your smarty pants doesn't get that wasn't serious. 
Look I can write out some long ass sentence to about why I'm attacking your own personal logic.

You know just sending me links and without an actual argument doesn't make me want to click on the links.

For every complaint you have with coinbase there are probably more people who have lost bitcoins with their own negligence. I'm not advising anyone to do that, it's just an at your own risk option just like holding on to the private keys yourself. 
If you have that big of an issue with coinbase you should also go around getting mad at banks who have the same or worse track record, but are also insured.

If you're not tech friendly and need an option over the other one coinbase isn't a terrible option. They help eliminate the user error. You can also set up extra security. I'm not saying it's the most secure, or what you should do but once you're in control of your private keys that means you have to now trust yourself to not make mistakes.
@_date: 2017-10-08 03:19:38
You aren't really explaining the other side. The people who don't know anything and choose to do nothing still aren't using segwit, they aren't choosing it. If no one is using a scaling option, does it really make it an option?

I'm not even going to spell out why it matters how much people are transacting with a cryptocurrency.

Okay now I'm actually scared. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-10-07 15:14:44
Holy crap those are terrible analogies. On chain or off chain scaling isn't life or death. I don't think you're "techically astute" enough to make  comparisons.
 For bitcoin to be effective everyone doesn't need to be able to run nodes. Everytime someone on here gets an erection over what ever LN is no one can explain it, no one knows when it will be implemented and on top of that there are a lot of theoretical  (yes theoretical beacause LN isn't in mass use) problems with it.
 Segwit is not bitcoin, bitcoin cash is not bitcoin. If we're going to get all gospel using legacy is the only true bitcoin. You're ignoring a lot of actual data and opinions and just saying "you're wrong I'm right" with nothing to back it up.
2x to me (used to) means we get a quick scaling option that is currently needed while also adding segwit future scaling, which was a fair compromise. Off chain scaling is not what bitcoin was about, it's a ledger system where all the data is supposed to be present and validated.
To be fair, segwit or not you're arguing about a crypto currency that is having a civil war on trivial crap while were seeing other projects that can do so much more with much less toxic communities. It's currently my least favourite one to actually transact with (and holy mother of fuck if you tell me it's supposed to be a store of value then ill rip you another one)
But whatever pick your side and dig into your trench. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 09:56:47
To be fair. There also hasn't been anything like this in history. 
edit: I'm glad what I said was so controversial, but damn the lack of knowledge of what makes bitcoin different is staggering. Before jumping to assume I'm excluding bitcoin from suffering the same fate, I'm not.

First off. To the comment I made you are responding to. It was a generalized statement. MOST people on here don't know shit and just circle jerk to whatever the fuck they think segwit is. If you DO know what's going on and for whatever reason think segwit is the only way, idk that's your opinion fine.
Dude you're a developer. I'm a developer. My dogs a developer. Fucking spare me.  If you want a pissing contest I've been dealing with bitcoin longer than you. That isn't an argument that supports why your "side" is right.
To your 3rd point. Before "core" got thrown around here and became a big shit show actually used to be a fun place to talk about things. My point is this has become a pick your side battle. You're either or and **THAT'S FUCKING IT.**  Most top posts in here are just people patting core on the back. 
Put your knowledge to use and actually tell me WHY segwit is the ONLY and best option, tell me why 2x is shit. Tell me why larger blocks are shit. Until then this is a pissing contest of who can type more. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 05:43:15
Lol I didn't even say anything about market cap. That's transaction volume bruh, VOLUME. Meaning how many people are USING it, not how much it costs to use, not market cap. Fucking stupid bruh so stoopid. Bruh  doesn't even know what transaction volume means, bruh can't even defend himself on how a large block isn't even a fix, and so you don't pee your pants I'm not even saying its the right one but you're so dumb you don't even see how it could be one, that's why I kno u stoopud bruh. run on sentence mah bruh
@_date: 2017-10-07 09:41:49
Just the fact that "core" gets thrown around so much, and that certain people believe they are holy coders is against your whole argument of decentralisation. Just because everyone can run a node doesnt mean miners still cant do a 51 attack. On top of this the block chain is going to grow so big even with a 1mb limit that most people won't want to put the time and effort into running it. My opinion on 2x, and what it actually was is a compromise, which isnt a bad thing in the fact that bitcoin needs  a bunch of things to work together. Not just one group saying fuck you to everyone who doesn't want what i want 
Edit: holy crap within a 30 minutes i get basically the same response 3 times. To the acting as if core isn't the main group doing coding, I bet you weren't even around before they became a thing... I'm not sure what drives you guys to be this passionately blind to just pick one side.
@_date: 2017-10-08 02:58:47
Lol you can't even explain why your opinion makes sense. Thanks for literally clarifying nothing other than saying "It's this way because I say so."


Lets address this for a second. 
I'll explain in plain english for you. That's a chart. It's between Ethereum and Bitcoin. Currently Ethereum a coin with faster confirmations has more transaction than bitcoin. Now if you need me to spell out why your argument is invalid, click the fucking link again.


And if you don't think large blocks don't actually help scaling you're an idiot. The reason we deal with high transaction fees are becasue of full blocks. You want a good analogy? Billy's gotta bring his stupid fat bed ridden mom soda, but every day she wants more and more, but billy only has one stupid fucking small glass. Well if Billy took his stupid brain work he'd grab a bigger glass for the moment until he figure out a way to maybe install a soda fountain in her fucking head. 
I'm not saying block size is the right and only fix, but holy shit it definitely is one. 
BUT honestly I don't give a fuck what happens. I just want more money that's what we all want.
Fucking greedy bastards. Your logic is shit.

As a "decentralized" currency a small amount of people are the ones in control.  That plus the fact what does bitcoin have over any other cryptos besides being the first and a slow block chain.Hey if being first is all you need why aren't we all running the first version of windows or unix.
Also I ain't no nerd, I'm not claiming to know anything. If you want to tell me I'm wrong and can say why please do. Like I said I have bitcoins, I'd prefer for them to stay relevant.

possibly the time to buy in.
@_date: 2017-07-13 04:09:22
Don't buy. It's dead. Ponzi scheme. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 16:04:26
I've bought a bunch of times it declared dead. Just not enough to make me "rich". Also I'm not sure why people think I'm serious lol
@_date: 2017-07-26 19:22:51
Pretty sure 99% people would have done the same thing. 
@_date: 2017-07-17 02:14:13
Are you saying that because of coinbase.
@_date: 2017-07-13 16:03:04
I know it's not a good joke. But it's weird everyone is taking me seriously lol
@_date: 2017-07-17 02:15:51
Yeah to piggy back off this. He got the full extent of the law to be made an example of.
@_date: 2017-07-17 06:02:39
Probably coinbase's guess as well. So it's probably a good one. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:35:52
To be fair. You guys got me so paranoid. I don't know whats worse. Transferring my coins to my computer (which is an online computer that anytime I look something up on this subreddit you guys make me feel like my computer probably has crazy maleware) or let coinbase handle security. Idk whats worse. I lose my coins myself or coinbase loses them. 
Yes I know about paper options. (no offline computer, no printer available to me thats offline) Trezor would come soon enough.
Guess I'm fucked.

Terrible time to buy it's currently dying. Bad advice. Stay away. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 03:25:31
yeah this seems like a fever dream. I'd like to get to a point where whatever this alt coin is, is just as untalked about as the 100s of other altcoins no one uses.

TBH I've had transaction from coinbase (where they deem them to big to send without that extra security of me taking a photo of my ID) be sent out and confirmed in under 5 hours. Not sure what if people are just lying and saying they've been waiting weeks.. Idk. I'd jump on the hate wagon with all of you, but I've been using coinbase since it was first announced and have never had an issue.

Both subs are pretty shit.
