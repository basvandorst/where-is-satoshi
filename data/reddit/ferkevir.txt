For global challenges you need global institutions, this are non-profit transparent organizations.  members are voting tasks to do. (modern green pieces with transparent budget ) so they have universal ligitimicy wich can be easily accepted by global community. of course they will possibly get under fire by status quo but to gather they can overcome every challenges.

:-), 
 Joke aside those who have something they go to gold to protect themselves. Most people have nothing and they get used to it, that's why they called third world. Getting used to situation is the biggest sickness, and they think their government is the best, no criticism if you criticise you will be labeled as terrorist.

In any country interbank transaction confirmation time is 24 hours. Banks blocks are 24h. Bitcoin is 10 minutes worldwide. This doesn't mean you buy a pizza and wait 10 minute. Transactions are real time (second) . Confirmations are for big business, and they  have an hour to wait. 
I think one should not mix transaction and conformation, they are different things in bitcoin universe.

Answer is 5 global institutions. 1.water, 2. Lands, 3. air, 4. open space, 5. Satoshi Institute. Bitcoin can be mined only by these institutions .

I am not convinced. Or I didn't get it. 
I  do imagine this scenario, 
drug company gives  public key on outside the package loded with 5 Satoshi , than it has a private key inside the package, once you use private key and get 5 Satoshi it means that the product has been sold, than  drug company's website tracks that address once value become zero on their website that Bitcoin address greyed, that means products sold. So no one can counterfeit their products.

Come on you are not embedding your idea in to blockchain (that would be very expensive) just a single transaction to the text you created create a wallet from it. (you can create a single wallet from entire Bible) The thing is you used that wallet FIRST TIME that means you were the creator. Simple don't think source code bla bla. ☺

 Bitcoin is an answer to this slavery. That is the whole point of  Bitcoin philosophy. Don't miss the point. Of course banks will do anything in their power to block the idea of Bitcoin. Will they success? I don't think so.
 Stick to course welcome to Bitcoin revolution.

There are Bitcoin believers, there are Bitcoin traders, and early adapters. I think this last price up is traders work.
