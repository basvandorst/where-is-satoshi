agree. and look, don't shoot the messenger here. it's Tom Lee and Bloomberg Gadfly on the debate and blockchain.info on the data. 
i just plugged it into Excel.

to be clear, I am not "a bear" on the technology.
i am "a bear" on things that appear to me to be speculative manias and this is one of them. 
but if you search "bitcoin" on my site, what you will find over, and over is that while I think bitcoin will ultimately collapse, i am not that guy who is rooting for you to lose money.
i am always - always - happy to watch people get rich. so if you can trade this thing and become a billionaire, well that's fantastic. 
but as someone who has years of experience in markets, i just think people should understand that for the time being, this is a trade. that's all it is. a speculative trade.
the other thing you have to understand is that even if *you* don't see it that way (i.e. even if you view it as a play on the future of exchange), other people are most assuredly piling in for the speculative gains. if enough of those people jump on the train, they can turn what wasn't speculation into a speculative bubble.
in short, i don't have anything against bitcoin and i damn sure don't have anything against people making money trading it. 
i just think people should be careful. also, it's fun to write about. i don't care what side of the argument you're on, you can't say it's not fun.
