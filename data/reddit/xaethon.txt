Financial services are an exception to VAT. 
Sorry for clarifying it to everyone, including you. No need to be so arrogant.

I was clarifying that, confirming that VAT is not applicable to any currency. So you cannot implement it onto a currency, VAT is payed by the consumer (yes I'm sure you already know that). 
The only reason that VAT at 20% was applied, was because Bitcoin wasn't valued as a currency, but 'voucher'.


Legal tender also only refers to the repayment of debt. If you, the debtor, go offer your lender three bitcoins to repay your debt, they are within their right to refuse it and request it in legal tender - i.e. Bank of England currency, and if you refuse then they can sue you for non-payment. [Said that to someone else here already.]( And if you want confirmation on that, you can read it from [our Royal Mint here]( Or our [Bank of England website](
I was just simply clarifying it for you and others that VAT is not applied to currency, but goods and services. The capital gains tax may apply, as it does for dividends, but it wouldn't affect ordinary transactions that a currency is used for, whether it be Bitcoin or Pound Sterling.

Just ignore him, it seems he does this to everyone who tries to clarify and explains things to him.
See what I've told him here

You don't pay VAT on a currency, it applies to goods and services.

To me it seemed as though you so not understand our system at all. 
If I've got it wrong what tore saying, please make it clearer then. I saw you asking how can they put VAT onto a currency and using the term legal tender when it seems as though you don't understand what they mean, or at least the British way which is what this concerns.
I'm sure more than one person 'misunderstanding' you means you haven't explained it well.

Legal tender is only an issue for the repayment of debt. If someone brings you 2.8 Bitcoins in order to repay a debt, then the other person is free to refuse and demand it in legal tender, i.e. Bank of England notes/coins.
