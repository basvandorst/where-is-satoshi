The largest ECommerce platform is Gmarket. Why does everyone think they need to manipulate every piece of news all the time?

Well, you fail to consider that no new money was able to move into crypto in Korea for the month of Jan. The government temporarily suspended Korean Won deposits into all cyrpto exchanges. What do you suppose will happen to the market on the 30th, when this suspension is lifted and all exchanges allow Korean Won to be deposited again? No Korean has had the chance to buy the dip, basically. I would imagine a huge flow of money, currently on the sidelines, waiting for the suspension to be lifted on the 30th. Expect the prices to rise again in the ROK once that happens. The only question is, will other exchanges follow suit? Especially now that arbitrage is even more difficult than before. I would expect the % difference between Korea and other markets to grow once again.

What exchanges in Korea use anonymous trading? Bithumb and Korbit are the two I use. both of them have a copy of my Alien Residence id card (ARC) and a copy of my passport. Every bank account I used on these platforms requires that my real name matches with the id cards. The only notification we got from Bithumb regarding the new regulations is that they will discontinue trading to minors, and anyone under the age of 19 must transfer their money out of Bithumb. 
Oh, and I read a Coinone letter announcing that foreigners must use their Korean phone to verify that they live in the country.
Maybe there are some hidden/small exchanges that don't require real-name verification? But I can tell you, this is insignificant. Any secure and useful exchange already does this.

Largest would be a lie. You are using a superlative on something that is provably not the largest. An exaggeration would be like "Huge" when in fact it is not that big. But I can't "Largest" and call it an exaggeration. It is provably flase.

200,000+ signatures is not insignificant. Also, you underestimate Korea's currently political sentiment. After the president Park protests, people here feel empowered. 
To quote a translated online comment I read recently during the FUD:

I really think the prospect of war has little to do with it. Koreans aren't thinking about NK like people in the US. No one seems to care about it.
Now, if you start to understand people's obsession with gambling and their effort to escape Hell Jeosun, then the volume becomes clear. As well as the foreward thinking of their technological culture. Tokens of value exchange are nothing new here. 
No one is investing because they seriously think there will be a war.

Replace the technology "bitcoin" with "email" and go back to the 90s. It's the same way you sound right now.
Why would I use email? I mean, it might save a few cents. But stamps are pretty cheap. And it might save some time. But usually, I can just call friends if I need to speak with them....etc.
The internet has created a global network and a global economy. Try sending money to someone in Korea with PayPal. Try sending over 5,000$. Now try 250,000$. It can't happen without a lot of time and fees to pay the middleman.
I think you are right. Bitcoin is not primarily for buying T-shirts online. At least, not until there is another layer (which is coming soon). Its value is in the decentralized technology which it uses, which can be applied to even more than commerce.

I am not ashamed of myself. Because I am not posting another meme about the price. I am sharing how I came to interact with Bitcoin naturally, outside of this subreddit. Which, to me, is exciting. Because it is rare and, actually, the first time I have heard positive bitcoin news in the media. 
If you didn't know about Korean banks using Bitcoin, then it is your own uninformed fault. But I never expected to hear about it on the TV in the lunch cafe today.

No one cares about using crypto to buy coffee or watches of whatever. People are interested in the groundbreaking technology and future possibilities. They are talking about bigger ideas. They are investing because of what it means for the future. Imagine a world without voter fraud? That alone is incredibly valueable technology.

I don't understand. The article mentions North Korea building weapons to reach mainland US. Not  South Korea.
I think this is a huge miscalculated statement, OP. If you talk to cypto enthusiasts here, NK is the last thing on their minds. If they really felt the won was in danger, why is its value rising against the USD lately? Stop making assumptions.

I don't understand. This has been posted several times since Friday. 
The reason behind their plan to "regulate" instead of "ban" is quite intriguing. They site crypto as an essential part of the 4th industrial revolution. And then they say that they want Korea to be a leader in that revolution. It is so crazy to hear a government pretty much predict that crypto will be a part of our future.

I do think liquidity will be affected if they outright ban ALL virtual accounts. Right now it is unclear what the government statements are saying. Is it all virtual accounts? Or virtual accounts that are not issued with user's real name matching their I.D.?
If it is the former, liquidity will probably suffer in the short term, as Bithumb will switch to a Coinbase-like system. I imagine it will take more time and effort for traders to switch to that system and go through new verifications.

This sensational headline is clickbait. Plans a ban......on temporary issued bank accounts which Korean exchanges use to allow you load Korean won onto their exchange. Ugh! I hate this stupid FUD from all directions.
When you move Korean won into Bithumb, they set up a 3 hour bank account that goes away after 3 hours. It is your account with you name. But it is temporary. 
They want to ban this practice. It has nothing to do with banning Bitcoin!
People, check your source! Ask yourself what Ver wants you to do. Panic sell your Bitcoin! Especially when this news is very harmful to Bitcoin Cash, since they plan to ban China from buying on Korean exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:45:25
Bithumb is a Korean exchange. Not Japanese. You need to submit an ID showing you live in Korea to trade. As well as many other validation requests. You even have to submit ATM deposit receipts to prove you used a Korean bank.
How is Ver, speaking to Japanese people about Bcash, reflected in a Korean exchange? 
Everything goes at a premium in Korea because the Korean gov. basically said this tech is important for the 4th Industrial Revolution, and the people here are very open to new tech. Most transactions already happen with reward point cards and other tokens.
Dont mistake Korea's obsession with crypto as Chinese or Japanese influence. I can't go a single day here without hearing about it from someone new. I work in the tech industry here though.

Just saying. The Korean market is trading at 20,000USD. It is easy to verify this. I doubt that the recent small dip in the US market is because of this hack. Just my opinion, but I would assume the Korean market would be affected first. It has been up around 1% today.

Creation of new accounts is not banned! Come on people!
Creation of new anonymous  BANK accounts are now banned.
In Korea, anonymous bank accounts are created for almost every purchase. It is a security measure. If you buy something on Gmarket, they generate a new bank account for you that is onky open for a few hours. Many businesses do this. Bithumb also did this as an option to deposite won. The gov. is saying that, in order to buy on Bithumb and other exchanges, you must now register your actual permenent bank account attached to your id. Ugh... The FUD. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:55:16
While I am not Korean, I have been working with Koreans for a long time now, and live here. I observe a lot of how they feel about their place in the world economy. I talk every day to Phd holders in scientific fields about crypto and the future. 
They do not hate Japanese people or Chinese people. Far from it. They don't see China as enemies. But economically, they are tied together. And I guarantee that Korea is always looking to increase their position (what country isn't?). And they still hold onto the idea of gaining economic dominance by forward-thinking, which is driven by old grudges. 
I hope I am speaking clearly, and not painting Koreans as angry and hateful. But, when it comes to new technology, they are not going to be left behind. Especially with Japan trying to lead as well.

Without Andreas, I would never have gotten into Bitcoin. His incredible depth of knowledge is why I became a strong believer in this emerging technology. Like him, I had to sell and struggled to hold most of my coins due to rent and debt. But, I still held onto a small amount, believing in the technology. And I watched his videos all the time, which encouraged me to hold what I could.
I too felt sick when I saw that tweet. And I was thinking about what Roger said, and how it applied to me as well. If I had more wealth, I would have bought more Bitcoin. If I didn't have a family and rent and bills, I would have kept more of it. But life is life. And shit happens. That tweet made me feel sick. It made me feel as if Roger was talking about me. It made me feel as if this childish and insecure man would never consider me an equal because I am not a millionaire. Where at one time I considered holding onto 1BCH to hedge my bets in this game, after reading that tweet, I sold it all. I will never ever touch anything that man does or agrees with. I don't care if, in some insane world, BCH becomes worth billions, and BTC worth 0. I will never look back at this moment with regret. Because I can not support anything this cold-hearted man supports.

In my opinion. This is not average speculators. This is not normal people moving the price up this fast. It is impossible. There has been no major major news on mainstream media. Not enough to get this thing moving so fast.
Here is my opinion: this is Wall Street. GDAX is the major on-ramp, and it is leading the charge right now. Other exchanges can't even keep up with their money.
We just got an outline of how the BTC futures will be traded. USA just woke up. In my opinion, this is Wall Street money moving in before the futures kick in. They must expect futures to trade BTC very high, and they are taking cuts now.

Hold up...
1.) You don't need to buy a whole bitcoin. You can buy 5 cents worth of bitcoin if you want. 17k a pop? To send e-mail? This is serious FUD! Now, we have fees. In the future, with scaling fixes, the fees will reduce. 1$ a pop, maybe. I will give you that. You have to pay a small fee.
2.) To send money across borders right now, you are eating a 20$ fee, plus a crappy exchange rate. So, yes, 1-5$ a pop is better than the current system.
3.) It takes time to move money across the world. When I move money to the US from Korea, it takes about a week, if I remember correctly. I started using Bitcoin now, and things go much faster. So again, like email, it is much faster than sending a letter.
4.) Your analogy itself is flawed. I am talking about sending money. Download a free Bitcoin wallet. Think of that as your email address. Now, load it up with 5$. If you send that 5$, you pay the fee, and the money arrives. If you send 250,000$, you pay the small fee, and the money arrives. You aren't dropping 17k to send the money. And I am not talking about selling the Bitcoin. I am talking about sending the bitcoin to someone else in another country. 
Man, this is one of the most FUD infested comments I have seen on Reddit. First, you are assuming it's only value is in getting rich. This tech is much more than that. And you are assuming you have to drop 17k to use the technology. Wha????

Anyone who understands the culture here should know Korea will not ban Bitcoin. They will embrace it harder than Japan. The gov. will start pushing banks and businesses to develop new platforms for it. They will give grants to crypto startups. Banks are going to embrace it as backend. There are 2 reasons for this:
1.) China banned exchanges. Korea would never follow in the footsteps of their old communist dictators.
2.) Japan has embraced it. They will never let Japan, their old empirical overlords, win at this game. They will try their best to build faster and stronger than Japan in every field possible. 
Economic domination is Korea's way of revenge for the years of suffering from both China and Japan.
Korea is always embracing and innovating in every technological space. They are incredibly driven to succeed. Now, more than ever.

Do you think they forgot? Do you think Korea doesn't hold dear to their democracy, and actually try to distance themselves from the politicking of communist China? Citizens staged a revolt not too long ago (1980s) in Gwangju, and shed blood defending democracy. 
Do you really think Koreans don't look at the politics of communist countries with dissatisfaction? Especially China? If China bans exchanges, Korea will only open up their regulations to allow exchanges to operate, just like Japan did. This is what they are planning to do. They are not planning to follow China. 
Read the articles about this news. You can read between the lines of their statements. They say things like, "Japan already has a regulatory outline for crypto." This is like them saying they fear they are behind. They need to do the same. And do it better. 
So, it really sounds like you don't understand the tension South Korea has between China and Japan. Yes, they do hold resentment for their Chinese neighbor, because of their communist rule and because of their control of Korea in the Qing dynasty. And yes, they will try to do the crypto game better than Japan. This is a new technology that they can not let their democratic rival dominate in. 
I work at a science university in Korea, which is government funded. Classes, workshops, start-up grants, and everything is pouring into the crypto development space. I even heard rumors that some research institutes which are government run are actually mining crypto to run experiments and test the systems. Banks are already starting to use the tech for their backend.
They are never going to ban crypto. I guarantee some people here are seeing this as a way to get ahead of the old western domination of the economy. And they are going to push for it, hard.

Not saying it is the ideal situation or even what is happening here specifically. But, in general, for any scientific conference or gathering that is touted as an "international" conference, everything is done in English. This is not to appease the English native speakers. But to communicate to the international community, who usually uses English as at least a 2nd language. Often, the conferences are shared online, and many people, especially in the STEM field know English and publish in English. 
I work for an IMO/ISO policy firm in South Korea. The researchers are from Korea, Japan, and China. Guess what language they speak at all their meetings? English. None of them use English as their native language. But it is how they must communicate.
Please, don't misunderstand this post as defending faketoshi. The whole "do you want my technology ever in this country" bit was atrocious and cringe worthy. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:17:27
Exactly. Even when none of the countries joining use English as their 1st language. It is the common, shared, and publishable language of the Sciences.
@_date: 2018-05-24 01:50:12
Are you a Scientific researcher? Have you ever had to submit a published paper for an international conference? What kind of chaos would it be if the Scientific community gathered and allowed any language? How can you share ideas that way?
Imagine heading to Germany for an international conference, and in the same panel of people, they are speaking Japanese, Chinese, Korean, German, English, and Spanish. 
There is a reason that Scientists need a global language. Ideas are important to share beyond borders and beyond your own culture. It's the only way to collaborate outside your language sphere. 
I am not saying it should be English, but because the top Universities publish in English, that is the currently agreed upon standard for the Sciences. In a few generations, it may switch to Chinese, but right now, it is English.
Saying "fuck your english standard" is extremely isolationist and prevents the Scientific community for spreading and sharing ideas globally. 
I guess there is always translation, but I am not sure if peer-reviewed journals have the budget to translate every submitted article from thousands of languages before being reviewed.
However, I am not sure where this conference was taking place and if this was the case. Was it advertised as an "international" event? Based on the video, it looks like there were people from other countries there besides faketoshi.

Now, I am sorry for my naivety,  but if I BIP encrypt my paper wallet while I am disconnected with a pass-phrase that only I know, then wouldn't this protect me from any sort of Malware seeing my data and deleted files? Like, even if they had access to the pdf I saved, since it is encrypted, there is no way of them having access to it. In fact, couldn't I hypothetically past my encrypted private key all over the internet and even on this reddit post, and still avoid someone from having access to my wallet? The only moment of attack would be when I am offline, putting in my passphrase for the encryption. How would anyone possibly nab that when it is created outside of the network?

I would love to do this type of work for nothing at all, as I am looking to get some sample projects for some more stable entry level editing jobs at a few Engineering firms. 
Looking over your site, I can see many places where the rhetoric could be vastly improved (much more than just spelling).

Also, just for posterity: 
The FAQ page under "Do I place Predictions against Fairlay"
"counterpart" is one word, and it should be "side" not "site"
The "How are Winnings Calculated?" section. "Winnnings" has an extra "n"
The next section, the article "a" is misused before the vowel in "event." It should be "an"
In the next section: "some predictions can be already determined" should read "some predictions can already be determined."

Hey, that site is pretty cool. Right now I am pretty wrapped up in this project. I don't think it will quite fit into something like this without really breaking the general feel I am going for. I am sort of trying to create sacred text for an entire universe where the tiniest bit of its construct (atoms, molecules, energy, and consciousness) are part of a P2P network. The protocol of the Universe is such that each cell verifies each other. It's really weird, with various figures and deities (I am a fan of William Blake's mythology, as well as what Hart Crane tried to do with The Bridge). As such, I really want this thing to be tied into an aesthetic that won't work well on other sites.  Thanks for the heads up though!

Generate another wallet in 2 seconds. No one will ever know it is you. I paste a public address all over my work to accept bitcoin donations. Everyone could know that it is me who owns that wallet. But all I have to do is use a private address to put the coins in, and no one will ever know it's me who has those coins. It's quite simple.

This is an interesting thing. The way I see it, rolling out with more bitcoin payment systems only means that more people will become aware of bitcoin and its benefits. And if someone becomes interested in using bitcoin, they have to buy it in order to spend it in the first place. I mean, whats the point if only the people who are currently into bitcoin decided to buy stuff on square with bitcoin? The price would shoot down and down, for sure. But You have to take into account the millions of people who use Square every day, and don't know about the benifits of bitcoin. All those people will have to buy in somewhere if they want to take advantage. 
But honestly, I am not a tech guy or an investor guy, so I could and most likely am dead wrong. I just think awareness is what will drive the price up. As an average Joe who came in because of the obvious benefits, I can only see exposure like this driving people to want to use the technology. Just my two satoshis.
Edit: Also, once someone buys something with BTC, that BTC is gone from their wallet. If they enjoy the technology and benefits, then they will have to buy more to use Square Market once again. Therefore, more buying. Correct me if this is not the way it should work.

That site is absolutely brilliant. I wish I had the know-how to do something like that. I would imagine being able to generate addresses for each post, and then tracking it like you can on megaphone. Well done!
I fooled around with IFTTT a bit as well, but I don't think I quite understand how that could help me track multiple addresses. I think, at this time anyway, I will just link each bitcoin address to the blockchain.info of that address, so users can click on them to see the ledger. This is the best that I can do, I think. So no sort-able ledger :(

Just a quick comment for context: I am planing on passing out physical copies starting on the 26th, which will be free unless you want to pay as well. If anyone is in NYC, I will be at the Brooklyn Zine Fest at the Keep This Bag Away From Children table. 
I wish I could find a way to make this print on demand for free, but I sadly won't be able to just print and ship to anyone in the future. So if anyone is interested in a physical copy, I plan on making it available at a print-on-demand service for everyone, which will be as cheap as I can possibly make it. As far as I know, there are no POD services that take bitcoin either :(
If you aren't into poetry, I think you should give this a try. It's quite different. I am really reaching for William Blakeish mythology, and plan on releasing more and more content based around this Peer 2 Peer universe as time rolls on. I am thinking this will end up being like a fictional holy-book, with several sections and chapters once it's all put together.

Bitcoin, in some capacity, will allow many artists, writers, and performers to saturate their work into the internet and spread to a wider audience without the aid of central publishers and contract holders keeping their content hostage. Bitcoin can guarantee the avoidance of censors and cultural gatekeepers, while still allowing for monetization and free distribution. It is a really wonderful thing, as a writer myself. I want to own my work, and give people the option to pay for what they like. Hopefully, this will become the norm.

Wow....those were great links, but they really confused the hell out of me. Hearing about change addresses and people loosing their bitcoin just for sending fractions of their whole balance, and then expecting them to remain in their wallet is a bit frightening. More so in that these transactions seem more complicated for mass adoption in the long run. Does that really happen? If I send you .5 bitcoin of my total 2, my remaining 1.5 enters into a new address? How do you have access to that address then? Where do you get that private key? This might be a new discussion entirely.

Of course, you should accept Bitcoin!
The only issue I see is you say that the Bitcoin community is close-knit, so you don't want to include it on the actual page or anything. 
We don't want to be close-knit. We want everyone to join the community. Much like e-mail, this is something people should be using all the time!
Part of why we want amazing foundations, such as yours, to include bitcoin is to grow that community. As such, we, the users, would donate simply as an investment in the technology. 
Simply put, I think this is a great start. But if you really want to see what this community can do, announce that you are accepting bitcoin, and take it head on, front page. You would get so many donations, as the bitcoin holder would stand to profit from doing so. 
The goal for us is to get more users to look into this payment system. Why would you want what will likely become the  way people will donate in a few years to be behind doors?

Some of that evidence is intriguing. It really could be that this is an organization or even the NSA behind it all. But I don't believe this is an experiment. Bitcoin is here to stay. If the NSA, or some governmental group did create Bitcoin and crypto, then they will fight to keep it alive (when I say fight, that might mean playing extremely dirty). It's scary too, the whole backdoor thing. The motivation behind it all could be to have a cleaner global currency that the govt. can control without their citizens knowing it, and even wrapping it in an "anti-govt." propaganda campaign, all while having backdoor access to the currency, and holding a major share of the pool.
It's too early, and it's all speculation at this point. However, I don't think Bitcoin holders are doomed if this speculation theory is true. 
More then likely, Satoshi is a group of individuals holding on to a lot of their creation because they know the potential and will become very very rich some day. Maybe even 50 individuals or more, with that 1mil pool split between them.
Blah! Who knows. This is all just ranting and speculation.

I honestly think "mainstream" will be different for the average user than we think. Bitcoin will be back-end for banks and current institutions. This is what "mainstream" looks like in my opinion. 
For example, Hana KEB in Korea has announced that it will fully embrace Bitcoin for overseas remittance, which I think the savings will force other Korean banks to compete in the same way. If all goes well, every bank in Korea will be using Bitcoin for overseas remittance, and people won't even realize they are using it. 
This is how the average user will use Bitcoin. Go to the bank, transfer money, receive faster and cheaper than before. This is what mainstream looks like to me. 
In Asia, it seems like they are keen on leading the way into mainstream adoption in this way.

You sell the bitcoin. It is so weird that people don't understand how basic and simple it is to sell your coins. If people are willing the buy it, you can sell it. 
Your bank account is linked to the exchange (it has to be to buy it in the first place). So after selling the coin, the money is deposited into your bank.
The value is determined by the market. Meaning that people are buying Bitcoin from people for 3.2k currently. If it falls, it means people are not willing to pay that much. If it rises, it means people are willing to pay more.

Basically, bitcoin has been moving up in price since it's creation. As of late, there was an argument about how to correctly move forward with the currency. Bitcoin got so popular, that scaling was an issue. The network was getting clogged up, and people struggled to figure out a solution.
However, a solution was accepted, and was implemented successfully. But a few people who wanted it the other way decided to "split off" and make a new alt-coin that is not following the majority.
When that fork happened, everyone with Bitcoin basically had access to both. So, if you had 1 BTC, you now had 1BTC and 1 BCH. 1 Bitcoin and 1 Alt-coin.
2 things are moving the price up now: 
1.) A scaling issue that has harmed the popularity of bitcoin for the past 2 years has been fixed. Confidence that this coin can actually be programmed to fix issues is very high. Bitcoin is showing us the future of a decentralized currency that is also adaptable with consensus. 
2.) People are taking their extra alt-coin, and selling it for Bitcoin. Even though it is still quite difficult to do, I would expect the price of the alt-coin to keep falling, as more BTC holders figure out how to safely move both coins from their wallets.

Where did I say centralization is limited only to miners? I too worry about centralization in many aspects.
However, mining centralization is one of those aspects in which Bcash is far more centralized (like PayPal 2.0, to refer to OP's statement). And this is a point of attack which makes it less secure and less centralized. 
You don't need to apologize to me. I understand that you worry about "more" than just miners, but you too are implying that it is not a good thing to have miner centralization in that statement. So why do you expect crypto users to compromise on one point of attack just because there are 3 others that you think are more important? Especially considering we have a coin that is less centralized and more secure? It's called Bitcoin.

Def. still early. My Dad left me a small sum of money when he passed away young and suddenly. I used most of it to pay private student loans with high intrest. But I still have low intrest gov. loans. I also kept a portion in savings and padded my checking account a little as well. 
I took a small percentage of his money and decided to go into Bitcoin with it. My resolve was that this thing could go to 500k and then I won't ever have to work again. Or it could go to 0$, and I would be out a small ammount.
Now, I have enough Bitcoin to finish off my student loans. But there is no way I am selling now. Because I believe this tech is like the new e-mail. And in a few years, more and more people will be usuing it. Banks will start using it as backend to move money. Global business won't be the same because of this very early tech. If you lived in East Asia, like I do, you might understand better how cutting edge countries are trying anything to stay ahead of the game. Korea and Japan are already talking about using blockchain tech in legacy institutions for signatures and remittance. 
Imo, 7k is nothing. It may go horizontal or even down for a year or two. But evetually, 7k will pass. Then 10k. Then who knows.
This is the new internet on dial-up. Would you ditch it before the broadband upgrades?
Oh, and also. With inflation, my student loans are also worth less and less each year. As long as I can make the payments, I am not going to give up on Bitcoin. 
Going for the very long bet will pay off. I believe it.

From what I understand, B2X does not have replay protection built in. So, after the split, if I want to dump my 2X coins, I have to get them onto Coinbase somehow anyway, right? Or another excahnge. 
How will I know that when I send my coins from my paper wallet to the exchange, they won't be protected?
I guess I figured holding my coins on Coinbase for a few days, then moving my BTC back to a new cold storage wallet would be easier and less risky. Coinbase would basically split my coins for me, and I would be free to dump them.
I am just wondering how secure Coinbase really is.
Please, understand, that I am a non-technical user and I don't have any clue how this "replay" protection stuff works. The last thing I want is to lose my coins when trying to split them on my own. But I also don't want to loose my coins by putting them on an exchange for a short time.

Nah. People are going to hold for the free coins. It doesn't matter if we hit 7k before, an I would expect buying pressure until the fork.
After the fork, one of two things could happen: 
people go back into fiat and alts, driving the price down, creating sell pressure. After seeing the free money come from the last fork, I bet more weak hands have bought Bitcoin in anticipation of this, and are ready to dump it all quickly.
Or, people use that free, freshly dumped 2x money they are not emotionally invested in to buy more Bitcoin, which drives the price up. People on the sidelines, waiting for market clarity would also rush in, seeing Bitcoin Badger take another fork. 
What makes this even more substantial than the Bcash split is that Coinbase will have your 2x coins ready to sell within 24 hours of the split. They still don't have a way for all those people to sell their Bcash.
It sucks, but the market is incredibly unpredictable.

This is huge news. If you are unaware, Kakao is one od Korea's biggest companies. They do everything online.

It is the defacto social media and messaging app, but is integrated into so much more.
Here is the main squeeze. KYC wont be a problem. To use most of their services, you must register your resident id. That means the rollout will be seamless for users. No complicated sign ups and id verification. For Korea, Grandma will be able to buy and use Bitcoin.

This is a huge company. This is more than just "Whatsapp" in Korea. Kakao, I would say, would be close to Naver (like google). They are a massive company with tons of platforms.
They have their own map, navi, messaging platform, uber-like service, and even banking (Kakao bank is a new service).
Many Koreans now have Kakao Bank, and I would imagine they would easily link the two. Imagine being able to seamlessly buy and trade coin stocks, and cash out instantly in a single and easy platform. 
This is seriously huge. Imagine, UpBit ads running on national TV here, basically advertising a BitCoin trading platform. I have a feeling this will happen. They will roll out with a huge PR campaign. 
As someone who lives over here, Bitcoin has become widespread, but still not mainstream. This is the kind of thing that will make Bitcoin a nationally known technology.
@_date: 2018-03-11 05:04:54
Several reasons. The first one that comes to mind is legitimizing the technology in the eyes of many people/ investors/ programmers/ researches/government workers. How could South Korea ban or regulate something that is driving a major sector of their economy? This makes FUD much harder to push. And will eventually lead to much wider adoption and use of crypto in Korea, and even possibly allow them to compete with Japan as a global leader in the sector. 
EDIT: 
I read this article carefully: 
If you can't see how a company with 90% market penetration which acts as a bank/uber/messaging/gift giving app and is well respected as an important tool for the daily lives of almost every Korean embracing cryptocurrencies, and even saying they plan to allow payments using them across all their platforms (microtransactions are very common, from buying emojis to playing games), then I don't know what you think adoption for crypto looks like. I mean, you can even use Daum and Naver with Kakao to purchase microtransactions in popular MMO games. 
This is so major for Korea that there really isn't a way to compare to other countries. Maybe it would be like if Uber, Square, and PayPal all had 90% market penetration and was used by everyone and was even integrated into Amazon and could be used at Wal-Mart, decided to integrate cryptocurrencies as a payment method? 
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:41:30
Korea's Internet setup is a blessing and a curse. Because they use their own platforms for everything, they are quite isolated from the rest of the internet, such as Google. Everyone blogs on Naver, and I haven't seen any English blogs about bitcoin, mostly because only Koreans use Naver. I will be on the lookout though!

Try sending money to another country through your banks. See how long and how much it costs. It has real utility now and is being used as such. You can send money across the world in seconds, like email. KEB Bank and soon Kakao Bank will be using it as backend to send money acorss the world. Think about that: a major Korean bank will be buying bitcoin to send across the glob for their customers who wont even need to understand the technology. You think once KEB offers faster transactions for a reduced price, other Korean banks wont follow? Korean gov. declared that using it for remittence is a legal practice. 
People just dont understand how large this is. Mainstream adoption is not users scanning QR codes. Its institutions using it as backend for average people who dont have the time to learn or care about the technology.
This is happening right now. Asia is taking the lead.

Private entities will always work for the maximum  profit in whatever system they find themselves. The current system encourages explotation of people by influencing government to pass arbitrary laws that benifit the private entity over the individual. I, for one, do not think any other way was possible before high speed internet. Now that we have this new technology, we can move beyond this flawed systen, which was necessary in the past, but is currently causing a bottleneck in progress.
For example. Take a look at Ag-gag laws, which are put in place by the FDA to prevent individuals from filming inside private slaughterhouses. These laws were passed which basically benifits the private entity within the system which allows it. Now that entity can make more money and not worry about reporters or people seeing poorer food handling procddures. I don't blame the private entity. They are making the most money in the system they are in, and it is more profitable to hire lobbyists to influence laws than to compete against other slaughterhouses. 
Imagine if I owned a slaughterhouse in a free market. No laws against filming or recording. And to compete, I had to improve my food handling conditions. And even set up my own cameras to stream online, 24/7, what is going on in my company. Because that is something the consumer wants. When my competitors buy HD cameras, I need to as well to compete. Now we are forced to compete to be the cleanist and safest, and if the market wants it, the most ethical toward the animals. 
As it is, most laws are what allow private entities to harm individuals for the maximum profit. And I don't think they can all go away immediately, but we should work to slowly wean ourselves away from the system which will eventually cause an even greater bottleneck for progress in the future. More and more corruption gets piled on hugher and higher. The government should soon go the way of thr Post Office. Something that is there, but excerpts less influence over time because of technology.

.92 won per USD. When I looked at a straight transfer, I lost about 10$. But I still have roughly 2 dollars in won in my Korbit account, because I wanted a rounded number of coins to sell on Coinbase.

play by  play:
had a coinbase account set up already in the states.
Set up a Korbit account in South Korea, and verified my bank with them.
1. Sent won to charge my Korbit account with won. was instant, and I incurred a 900 won fee (like 80 cents)
2. Bought bitcoin at Korbit
3. transfered it to a wallet address at Coinbase
4. Cashed out at coin-base with a 9$ fee. 
Money is in my U.S. bank account, and was faster and cheaper than wire transfer. Pretty cool.

I transfer money out every month via bitcoin (again, skipping now because the spread.) My friends use bank transfer. How is this any different than any other country? Why is it any harder to transfer money out of Korea compared to the US, or anywhere else?

I work in a foreign country, but have payments to make in the U.S. as soon as I started to use Bitcoin for remittance instead of bank transfer, I understood enough about it's practical applications to buy and hold some. Bitcoin is borderless. The internet is borderless. Fiat cannot be.

While this is a good explanation of what Segwit and the debate is about, it still says nothing about what people need to do who have their coins in a cold-storage wallet or aren't running a node or wallet program on a pc.
So yes, that ELI5 explains what segwit is and why it is happening. But it is a different question asked by my original post. Again:
ELI5 what the average user needs to do, if anything at all, with their paper wallet coins. If a split occurs, will the coins be lost? Will the wallets still work? Will the coins get put onto a random fork? Or can we choose? Or will they be on both? God, it's all so confusing, and to be honest, I am not asking how or why segwit is happening. I am just asking if my money is safe. And I still don't see a straight answer. 
If my lack of understanding is problematic, just understand that I am an average and low-tech user who loves the philosophy behind Bitcoin. I believe people out there just want to make sure their coins won't vanish or "break" or become unusable if they didn't do something before hand.

This is amazing news! The idea of my bank (KEB) starting to use bitcoin is unreal.

It's not for you, clearly. But as someone who works overseas with monthly student loan payments in the US, bitcoin has saved me 100s on remittance fees. Tried to set it up with bank transfer. Both banks wanted a cut and said it would take 2 weeks to process the money. Bitcoin takes 30 min. To transfer to my US account. Traditional money was not built for the globalized internet age. Bitcoin is. 
People like you may not need it, but it has immense value for me and thousands of other people.

When I search, almost all of the questions are regarding "nodes" and "frakensegwit" and USAF and which nodes to run and what this person said or didn't say. I still haven't read or seen anything explaining what someone with a paper wallet and a coinbase account needs to do to secure their money.  
I will give a direct quote from one of the search results: 
"Solution: Unbiased trading of REAL Bitcoin BIP148-SegWit tokens and Non-SegWit tokens one month before actual BIP148 SegWit activation
I hope there is an Exchange ABC that will start trading "Bitcoin-BIP148" SegWit-enabled tokens, as well as "Bitcoin-Old" Non-SegWit tokens, starting 1st July 2017, i.e. one month before BIP148 flag day. The exchange's customers will find the underlying coins, and not any future, derivative or bet, in their account balances, and can trade them exactly as if the two chains exist already!"
Average users don't understand any of this. Hence, the ELI5 tag.
