This might be true.
The difference is that Bitshares IS doing it (actively working on getting everything working).   (And so is NuBits).

In the Bitshares system you can hold your money in whatever form you want (which has a working bitAsset.  So far there are Gold, Bitcoin, and some currencies.  In the future Silver, Oil, more currencies, etc will be added).  
If you think the USD is going to collapse in value, then you can hold bitGLD and track the price of Gold instead!  Or you can simply hold BTS itself, which represents equity in the bitshares system, and would go up and down based on how well Bitshares is doing.

Hopefully it will enable trading of bitcoin, gold, silver, and other assets on a decentralized exchange without counterparty risk.

Bitshares launched this summer.  Its still not in a full release state, its under constant development.  It also still needs mobile wallets, better user experience features, etc.
The technology is very young, but has a lot of promise!
If anyone has development experience in making things like mobile wallets, you could apply to be hired by the blockchain in order to create them!  You would just need to convince bitshares holders to vote for you to get paid to do the project.

Here is your 7 words:
Bitshares = stock exchange of the internet.
(And all of the trading fees profits made by that stock exchange are paid as a dividend to holders of bitshares.  The way the dividend is paid is that some bitshares are burned, so there are less remaining, so each one's value increases).

Is bitSILVER trading yet?  I thought it wasnt activated yet.  BitGOLD is trading but so far the userbase is still very small.   
Liquidity should improve once the userbase grows.
