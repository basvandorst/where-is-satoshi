Dunno why I'm getting downvoted lol. The $3000 support level is right there on the chart.

History repeats itself. Until it doesn't.

McAfee is revealing his real fears. If he was genuinely bullish about bitcoin, he'd be talking it down so he could quietly accumulate on the cheap. Instead he is talking it up. The man's hand is weak.

Next support level is $3k.
Having said that, it doesn't mean $3k will hold. $6k held for months but it eventually broke. Why buy at $4k when you can buy at $3k?

Nice. I'd short too, but my broker charges a fee for every overnight short position. :(

Looks like the next support level is $3000.

I don't see it. The next biggest group of buy orders is around $3000.

$5000 just collapsed on my chart. Yikes!

This is panic time. $6k was the last institutional line in the sand. Deep pockets upheld this support level, and now they're caught on the wrong side. This can only add to selling pressure as they try to unwind their losing positions.

What price level would be good to enter? $1k? I could buy 4x as much as now.

Bitcoin may be limited, but there is no limit to the number of cryptocurrencies. The more there are, the less valuable bitcoin becomes (due to competition, dollars being spread out etc).

When is the Black Friday sale going to end? Seems like they're extending and deepening the discounts!
