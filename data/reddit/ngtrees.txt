Not quite.  
By changing the way we propagate blocks we could make the amount of data necessary to be propagated after solving a block remain approximately constant size regardless of the number of included transactions.  This removes the "racing miner" problem of smaller blocks propagating faster.  (The full block size will still vary with transaction count, but a winning miner doesn't have to broadcast the entire thing because most miners have similar sets of unconfirmed transactions in their memory pool. This is the concept Gavin is leveraging.)
 - incentive to mine small blocks is gone
 - blocks get larger (include more transactions)
 - transaction fees decrease
 - network is more efficient
Gavin also does a back-of-the-envelope calculation based on the size of an average transaction (his block propagation proposal will not affect this).  Based on this calculation his 90 megabit per second connection can download transactions at a rate which is 10 times the average tps of the Visa network.
Edited to clarify block size vs propagation size.

I recently weighed heavily the choice between windows and Linux.  I am a researcher and this involves a lot of coding for which Linux is much much preferred.
The drawbacks I faced were not games but instead vendor specific software available only for windows, a lack of adobe products for Linux, and a general lack of flexibility. It's hard to invest in a PC when you aren't sure it will work for something in the future.

In the end game mining chips are going to hit a ceiling and technology will advance slower than today.  
Governments with a vested interest in Bitcoin may find it beneficial to distribute these slow-hashing nodes to the population and provide a tax credit to pay for part of the electricity.  This could use previous generation tech and still make an impact:
Current hash rate: 15,000,000 Gh/s
Population of france: 65,700,000
To get half the network hash rate each person would need to poses ~250Mh. 
About 1 AM USB Block Erupter seems like a lot but as asics catch up to current chip-fab technology improvements will slow: the previous gen tech will have an impact much longer and be cheaper.
What other benefits might this have?  Well France would secure 50% of mining fees for its population.  The network (and France) would be more protected from the attack of another nation state.  Decisions about the protocol would be distributed away from mining pools and miners, further increasing network trust.
So there could be a large demand for such a device in the future?

Good suggestions.  The comparison to Pi was only in terms of low power/small.  Any hardware that can run a node in a set it and forget it way would be great.
A laptop is a great option, it is a little big though.  A small beagle box sitting on my shelf would be neater.  And having a straightforward guide written might encourage others to host a node as well.  
It would also encourage more distributed nodes, instead of spinning up a bunch of instances on the same virtual server as seems to be all the rage.

I doubt this innovation is targeted at Bitcoin.  With Bitcoins current economic structure these use cases are impossible.  Transaction fees are currently ~.0001 BTC per transaction. At 300Th mining 3600 bitcoin per day, each bitcoin costs .08 Th.  Say each of these chips wants to transact once per day.  Thats 8 Mh to cover the transaction fee..
That is all well and good for now, but as soon as bitcoin's value goes up so will the hash rate and clearly the difficulty.  I can't imagine a scenario where the chip could generate enough bitcoin to support making ledger entries or keep up with network growth.
I do see other possibilities - This opens the possibility of bootstrapping a new network, secured by a "device-functionality" incentive rather than monetary incentive. Subsidies could be adjusted to ensure an appropriate coin to Mh ratio.  Only DRM approved miners (21 chips) could mine on that network, this would be both secure and transparent, yet some control is centralized to the arbiter of the DRM.  Seemingly sufficient for device to device communication.   This could later be monetized, allowing parties write to this device-functionality blockchain in the same way as the bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2015-05-06 21:46:27
The situation is more complex that this post suggests, and I think dismissing the gravity of the privacy+bitcoin problem is a big mistake.
There will always be entry and exit points from the bitcoin world, where coins become linked to your person. If not on exchanges then at point of purchase, anytime bitcoin is to be turned into tangible goods there will be a link.
One time use of addresses is a standard practice, but does not mitigate taint style block-chain analysis. As day to day usage increases, groups of coins will only become more tightly tied to an individual.
Mixing services have varying levels of effectiveness for obfuscation.
In a society where bitcoin becomes heavily regulated, to the point where privacy becomes truly challenging, bitcoins fungibility will be compromised, and mixed coins could very well have decreased value.
The problem is not at all solved and its important that we keep developing technical solutions to this problem.
@_date: 2015-05-20 17:10:58
I maintain that alternative incentive structures for securing a block chain are both possible and interesting. A functionality incentive seems feasible and novel compared to the solely monetary incentive of the Bitcoin block chain.
As to the assumptions.  Power, and network growth are both prohibitive of these chips from an economic standpoint.  As for on chain transaction costs, for a chip with a fixed hash rate we have to consider transaction cost in hashing units, not BTC. Thus as the network grows so will the btc-hash-equivalent cost irrespective of the BTC fee (which is too uncertain at this point to build an entire business model around anyway). Inserting records into factom will be cheaper, etc, but these factors are prohibitive of bitcoin mining.

This is a great counter argument but I don't think the emergence of colored coin stocks is mutually exclusive with bitcoin being the only currency.  The shares could easily be sold for any currency, mitigating the cost of a BTC price drop on the attacker's incentive.
If the colored coin market cap is $5T and BTC is only $1T then the economic incentives of miners have definitely changed.  In reality this 5:1 ratio could become even larger - and we already have a scenario where transaction fees are likely not going to support the network in its current form.  I think this incentive structure is more fragile than we give it credit for.
As these economic incentives shift, a period where attacks become more economically feasible is definitely a possibility.

I'm with you 100% - it is about mining, just in a non-Bitcoin framework.  I think all of the issues (power, obsolescence, etc.) can be resolved with a creative new cryptocurrency implementation.

If you read a bit further down the comments discuss the quadratic processing time for transactions.  A 1 MB block limits this to verifying a maximum 1 MB transaction, but the theoretical 20 MB block allows a transaction which would take hours to verify.  This was a minor point, though.

High quality analysis. Well written papers with some sort of logical argument backing up their claims.  This paper was well received for example.

No clue why all the comments are so negative.  This is great! I didnt think we would see funding for this research for a lot longer.  Not an incredible amount of money, but still a start.  
This is the only mechanism to fund any academic research on cryptocurriencies.  It should produce detailed analysis of things like the effects of block size, network propagation, etc. Some researcher may even implement a working prototype of IBLTs for block broadcasting, or come up with a scheme for distributed consensus we haven't thought of.
This will only give the community of developers more knowledge to build the protocol with.

The need for a block size limit is not such that there is an arbitrary limit on the size of blocks, it is relevant to the mitigation of attacks on the network and ensuring the network is hard to censor.

I have mined altruistically for a long time.  Yes, enough people mining altruistically (or mining for incentives other then monetary) will make it unprofitable to mine.  
This is only likely after chip efficiency and bitcoin price has plateaued.  It is an interesting evolution of the network to consider - mining could possibly be more decentralized and the network more secure with altruistic mining.

I still think the end game for 21 Inc is bootstrapping a new network, secured by a "device-functionality" incentive rather than monetary. 
Subsidies could be adjusted to ensure an appropriate coin to Mh ratio as more devices come online. Only DRM approved miners (21 chips) could mine on that network, this would be both secure and transparent, yet some control is centralized to the arbiter of the DRM. Seemingly sufficient for device to device communication and other uses. This could later be monetized, allowing parties write to this device-functionality blockchain in the same way as the bitcoin blockchain.

How I like to think about this:
Find the exchange rate the day you bought your miners, find how much you paid in BTC.
On the calculator set the USD/BTC rate to 1.  
As long as your "profit" is greater than the amount you paid in BTC, buying miners was more profitable than buying BTC - regardless of the conversion rate.
For Singles, purchased on April 4 (1300$ @ 130 USD/BTC), this date is around October 1. 
For Singles, purchased on April 5 (2600$ @ 130 USD/BTC), this date is around August 1.
Even after these dates you won't lose money as long as BTC goes up in value.  
This ignores other benefits of purchasing miners rather than bitcoin including: using a credit card (pretty huge)! contributing to the network! fun!
