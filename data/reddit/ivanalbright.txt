His post says thinks, not "knows"
Maybe it was an edit though

What would happen if some hacker caused the other major pool(s) to go down while one pool was nearing 50%? Suddenly it would be mining over 50% right?
I don't know really how viable that is but I assume at the very least if someone was able to infiltrate the pool's system, it could cause temporary damage and a temporary cessation of mining at the least? (I would think it would need to be more involved than some sort of DDOS thing but I don't know...)

I believe it would just be considered barter, in which case you still have to pay tax / report as income the fair market value of the good or service you received as "payment"
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:08:56
Say you earn 15 BTC and keep that BTC the whole year. How would you know how much income to report on your taxes?
For paying taxes, you'd have to wait until it you convert to USD. It can't really be viewed as any sort of income until then.

Paypal already takes their cut from a crazy amount of transactions. They don't really need to add another couple of drops to their giant bucket. On the other hand they would need to implement a lot of new systems, check and recheck them for security and reliability, train new support staff, etc... A ton of investment with what they are bound to see as something questionable.
Not to mention if they did offer bitcoin services, bitcoin would get a huge boost and less people would need to use their regular currency transaction services.

Nothing was said other than "we are kind of thinking about bitcoins" 
Anything else beyond that is speculation and I doubt even PayPal has come close to making any decision about any aspect of it what they might one day do with them.

You seem to know your stuff pretty well but the only thing I'd say is that at present the IRS might find things strange. Are you planning on converting the btc into USD/bank account at some point? Or just saving it and/or spending it at places that accept btc only?
Even people who run a legit cash business (like a retail store) sometimes have problems with the IRS when they make slightly abnormal deposits in their bank account. You not having a brick &amp; mortar store and being a "cash" business is likely going to raise money laundering flags. Plus having no record of who your customers are...look at it from the IRS point of view, you've got a lot of money and no way to verify where it came from or why.
Just my thoughts on the matter, I have considered accepting bitcoin on a small scale (in addition to the normal payment methods) and probably at this point I would just not bother reporting it as income. To be honest, until its converted to USD it really isn't income in the government's eyes is it? Its just a trade of goods/services until you yourself convert it to USD? It'd be like someone trading you credits for a video game in **their** eyes. 
edit: nevermind, I think it would be classified as bartering and you would be legally required to list it as gross income for the "fair market value" according to the IRS. following this line of thinking, would you be exempt from taxes then once you do deposit it in your bank account (for example 5 years later when bitcoin is 500x the price :)

Lite coin fees are worse at .1 ltc or 30 cents currently
Though I believe an update is close that is going to improve a lot of things.

my sarcasm was lost on you :(

Depends on how they do it. How would new users get their money into bitcoins using PayPal? It would have to be funded by a bank account and probably involve a waiting period and ID verification.

Is it a requirement that all in app purchases go through apple's app store? Say game x allows you to buy extra lives for money. Do those payments always go through apple and do they take a cut? What are the policies of Android/Microsoft for in-app purchases?
If that's the case, its not that apple is against bitcoin, its just that they're against everything that they can't get a cut of.

They'd be offering people an easy and supported way around PayPal's own person to person transaction fees. Instead of everyone paying 3% for every transaction back and forth over and over and over, PayPal would only be able to get a cut of the initial and end bit (buy-ins and cashouts using traditional currency). After that, people would just use the bitcoin wallet like they already do to avoid any PayPal transaction fees.
Just doesn't make sense for them to put resources into making that happen.

Every time ive tried to send bitcoins or litecoins, the wallet has said "the transaction exceeds the size limit" and forces me to either cancel or pay the fee. Why does nobody talk about this, doesnt seem like free transactions and I cant find any real info on this...?
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:35:10
My only options are cancel or pay, there's no option to send without paying. I calculated the bitcoin fee to be about $0.08 yesterday (it said 0.005 btc). The litecoin fee was $0.30 (0.1 ltc)
I was trying to move 0.15 btc and about 1.5 ltc. Equivalent to about $3-15 USD. Thats not a tiny amount, and I hadn't ever moved coins before that... it seems what I was trying to do would have been a very common size and type of transaction, so if I have to pay the fee I assume it happens almost all the time
@_date: 2013-12-30 03:16:49
what exchange do they use? 
or is it their script that handles the exchange is malfunctioning?
Just started mining on hashcows a day before they were hacked and just started mining on middlecoin less than a day before this happens. Am I bad luck?

So you now have $97,000 worth of gold and you paid say $20,000 out of your bank account in capital gains tax.
Then what happens in a month or a year later when you sell that gold for $98,000 USD? Do you owe taxes on that sale too? Do you just pay taxes on the profit you've made in the meantime ($1,000)?

But...does the US government recognize BTC as a currency?
I could have a big group get together and agree we would use potatoes as our currency, and I could get paid thousands of potatoes for goods and services I sell to hundreds of different people.
The government wouldn't see those potatoes as income until I converted them into USD though.
(Actually, probably better to replace the potatoes example with something like numbered scraps of fabric -- something controlled and without any value other than as a currency).

But any "toys" bought have to be reasonable and solely used for your business. You can't buy a new car for your "business" then use it as a normal personal car for things like groceries, vacations, etc.
Office space, computer, office furniture etc is reasonable for a "crypto currency R&amp;D" business, but an entire house that you live in as your personal residence, or a home theater system you use to watch movies for fun--those aren't magically business expenses just because you formed an LLC or whatever.

What is needed is a super secure e-wallet with double authentication (code sent to your phone to log in etc).
People in impoverished companies aren't going to embrace something that requires you to download several gigs of data on limited/slow bandwidth in order to store and spend money. And I think the current ewallets are just not trustworthy enough. It needs some sort of legitimate large, well known company I'm afraid.

Are there any services that take moneygram?
@_date: 2013-05-24 11:19:01
I think thats what I said? Though the term coin days being an official term is new to me.
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:06:44
Those are certainly valid points, but I think you missed the message. My point was that the US government doesn't recognize BTC as a currency, so how, or why, would they tax someone for getting BTC? 
Now when you sell that BTC for $ USD...that's when you've actually made income and thats when you pay tax, not before. As far as the the government is concerned, BTC is like potatoes. They are not income until they're sold for a recognized currency.
Your replies focused on the (bad) examples, not my actual point, which was that the government doesn't see BTC as income unless it's sold for USD. Obviously we see BTC as currency, and obviously BTC aren't potatoes to us, but that doesn't matter to the government as far as taxing income goes.
@_date: 2013-05-09 10:49:07
Sure but how long will that take to happen? Plus a small stamp thing might blend in and not be noticed even at a bank.
Can't say I really see it as a big deal for one guy to do this to a couple bills. Although if thousands of people started doing this it would certainly be something...different. And thats a different discussion.

What is the best (most reliable and safe) way to get USD into bitcoin right now **without** giving my bank account info?
In the past I used moneygram with bitinstant and it worked fine, a moneygram would be my preferred method. Anything like that available now (seeing as bitinstant doesnt seem to be coming back)?
@_date: 2013-09-10 21:58:49
Consider this: paypal creates an exchange and cash out system for bitcoin. Now people have an easy and safe way to get bitcoin. People buy bitcoin through PayPal and from their they put it in their own private wallets. Normally PayPal would continue to take a cut every time that currency traded hands, but now its out of their system. Why would they want to encourage that?
@_date: 2013-05-23 23:10:02
The ltc fees are only on small or "new" transactions (say if you just received some and you go to spend it within a day or two). But I think that is also the case with btc.
