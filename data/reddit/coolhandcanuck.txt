It seems weird to have coinmarketcap etc list the btc network's price based on it's highest denomination (one full bitcoin).  It would be kind of like currency converters defaulting to using conversion for a 100 usd bill rather than a one dollar bill.
We are in a nascent industry where people often look at the 11-12k price and say "that is too expensive for me" , without really understanding it.  It would make more sense to list based on Satoshi's in the not too distant future.  A full bitcoin is now inaccessible to many and pricing on that basis may be viewed as elitist.

From the article:
"What had been an “exorbitant privilege” devolved into an exorbitant liability. As my former professional colleague John D. Mueller, of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, formerly Rep. Jack Kemp's chief economist, writing in the Wall Street Journal in Trump's Real Trade Problem Is Money recently and astutely observed:
a monetary system based on a reserve currency is unsustainable, since foreign official dollar reserves (for example) are acquired and must be repaid in goods. In other words, the increase in official dollar reserves equals the net exports of the rest of the world, which means it must also equal U.S. international payments deficits—an unsustainable situation.
In other words, if President Trump wishes to address America’s merchandise trade deficit (balanced to perfection, of course, by a capital accounts surplus) he will find that allowing the dollar to be used as the global currency is the real snake in the economic woodpile.  The dollar’s burden as the international reserve currency, not currency manipulation by our trading partners or bad treaties, is the true villain in the ongoing melodrama of crummy job creation."

Please help me understand- bitcoin's key differentiation from PayPal is that it is decentralized peer to peer cash. Thousands of users around the world running nodes with decentralized confirmations securing the system against fraud, attacks etc and a system that is impossible to shut down (a truly beautiful concept that pulled me down the rabbit hole).
 If bitcoin now becomes centralized through the lightning network (Gavin A seems to confirm this would be the case), open to attacks on a centralized payment processor or a gun to the head of those who control it (by nefarious individuals, governments or otherwise) or if the LM gatekeepers perpetrate a fraud, how is that any different from PayPal?  Also, bitcoin would still have fees through lightning and PayPal has none for the users, so arguably it's worse than PayPal and certainly doesn't have the same merchant adoption as paypal.
Can anyone explain this to me?  I really like bitcoin, but I just don't get it...
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:31:01
My understanding of the forthcoming lightning network is that it will solve the issue of transaction cost/speed, but will also result in a very centralized system....so to answer the op's question about "might as well use PayPal" ...you don't need to since I guess that bitcoin will basically have a PayPal lightning network built in.  What I am unclear about is whether the user will have the option of lightning/no lightning - if so, then that is pretty cool-order a coffee use lightning, buy something bigger use pow system.

I don't like the slander, manipulation and distortion from either community - reminds me of why I wanted into bitcoin and out of the banks/governments in the first place!  
Isn't the best way to answer him to address the concern Re fees and transaction times by setting out a clear roadmap on lightning network, scaling etc?  Fix the problem and take away his leverage.

Put in only what you can afford to lose.  Then watch for fun, but resist the urge to day trade.  Even if you are super smart this market does not move rationally at all times.  Some day-traders are great, but most get rekt.  
My perspective is that what I put in is either going to the moon or the bottom of the ocean and all of these in between ups and downs are just noise.  Put it in an offline paper wallet and don't touch it.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:05:47
It would be fantastic if there was a pinned reddit comment setting out the safety concerns with the larger blocks etc and how core etc are working on the path towards safe scaling.  I think that a lot of community members would like to read about that instead of posts about "schlonging someone" or the endless memes about the price.
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:58:05
I don't see why there would be an issue with that if the side-chains are simply identified by different address formats but still all report to the same btc ledger.  There does not appear to be any issue as between segwit and legacy for instance.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:09:52
Imagine if there were side-chains to suit all of the different options including the miners.  Users would have increased choice, if one option was too centralized they could use another, the side-chains would compete to attract transactions, no one would feel excluded.  I personally think that would be a wonderful option.
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:47:13
Why do we have to "schlong" other bitcoin lovers who just take a different view of scaling?  Can't we all just get along?  Why not just actually scale the bloody network so that they have no argument?
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:20:15
When I started using segwit I noticed that you use a different address format and basically have a choice of using the legacy address format without segwit or the new segwit address format - you have the choice of which one to use.
Why can't we have a third address format with a mined scaled up version that people can choose to use if they wish to do so.
Hell, if the bitcoin gpu stuff actually takes off, why not have a fourth address format for people who want to use that one.  
We could all use the same system but choose the address format that we want to use which will be confirmed to the network in a different way.
Maybe this is not possible?  My son is the coder not me, but if we can do a different address format for segwit and allow the choice then why can't we offer additional options as well for the users???

@_date: 2017-11-22 14:55:09
Thank you!  Upvoted....but I have used segwit and it is definitely a big improvement for cost issues.  If we can intro a new address format for segwit and give users the option of legacy or segwit, why can't we intro one that has mined scaled up confirmations as well?  Wouldn't that allow choice?  If there are tech concerns they could be stated out front or even a disclaimer checked when using that address option?

Competition is good for users.  IMHO IOS and android would be shadows of themselves without each other.  Embrace the free market and it's effects.  It will make the projects stronger.
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:58:55
Thanks.  That makes a lot of sense.  Obviously, the users would have to weigh those risks when deciding whether to use them in any particular transaction.

Fwiw I think that it was a mistake to do the NY agreement meetings with the mediator that was chosen.  It would have been far better to use a top flight marriage counselor.  It seems to me that much of this fight is about hurt feelings and not feeling appreciated and respected.  We are all still in love with the idea of bitcoin and crypto-currency in general.  
One thought that occurred to me while I was using segwit recently - segwit requires you to use a different address format - you have the choice of using legacy or segwit. The plan is build litecoin on that second format I believe. Couldn't bitcoin simply introduce a third address format for a scaled up mined version of btc?
Ie: have 1.legacy btc address format, 2. segwit (eventually + lightning) address formatj and 3.scaled up mined version of btc.  If that occurred, all users of the network would have the choice of which address format to use, but we could all share the same system.  Hell, you could even add a fourth gpu mined option if people really like the bitcoin gold idea.  Why is that not a good idea??

If lightning is ready soon and it works as advertised with fast transactions and miniscule fees then its game over Re: bch and the price will go nuts.
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:11:31
It wouldn't be a separate currency, it would still be bitcoin (btc) you could just have more options of how you confirm your transaction with the network (similar to segwit versus legacy address formats, lightning etc)
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:01:13
Thanks.  I appreciate the explanation.  That helps me a lot.  Thank you for all of your work on this.
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:01:28
Very interesting read.  Thanks!  The core of my proposal is that maybe we don't need to decide..a decision maker will, by definition, decide against someone - maybe in a decentralized system we allow for more sidechains and allow the market to decide.  That way if it fails it isn't because of some gatekeeper that everyone can blame, it is simply because the market didn't want to use it/it had failings.

I am not a dev and so some of this is admittedly lost on me.  I do think there is a problem since transactions are taking too long most of the time and cost too much sometimes.  I haven't reviewed any charts in saying this, I just know from using it.  I was having dinner with two people and explaining how great crypto is but couldn't get bitcoin transactions to confirm quickly.
That is the problem that I see, I frankly don't really care whether it's bigger blocks, segwit, lightning, or whatever...i am just a user that wants the thing to work.  When are the problems going to be fixed so that it doesn't take so long or cost so much?

Trezor now appears to have a plan (see quote and link below):
"TREZOR Wallet, where you can access and safely claim your Bitcoin Cash coins. You will be prompted by TREZOR Wallet once you select “Bitcoin Cash” in the currency selector.
After this, you can use Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash side by side."

consider motivation for price drop-if it's nervous reaction to uncertainty of upcoming potential fork/confusion (i think it probably is) then price drop may continue for as long as nervousness continues or escalate as dates approach.  Or disappear if nervousness disappears.  This is the big issue in my mind, but no one really knows how this will resolve.  Depends on your risk tolerance and time-frame.  Timing the exact bottom is very difficult.
IMHO, if btc reaches amicable resolution price may well stabilize and increase.  
IMHO if btc forks then market will freak out further for a bit and perhaps then realize that they still own btc plus a new coin- I don't think that the impact of a split will be as dire as FUD suggests - you now own two versions of coin with both competing to gain mass adoption and no matter which one wins you hold it...or hodl it.  This may lead to higher prices too as market understands it and considers it calmly and rationally.
Worst scenario is that confusion and infighting continues with ongoing threats and uncertainty.
I personally agree that buying small amounts up to August 1 is a good idea, but I am buying to sell 5-10 years from now
@_date: 2017-07-12 23:44:41
can't we just have a compromise where the super-computers from (ie at least 3 different mining pools) do the first 6 verifications and anyone using a raspberry pie do all of the remaining??  Merchants can choose to accept transactions after the first 6 but not verified by system without complete.  That way it accommodates micro payments for average user and those who want to full verify with decentralization for larger amounts?
@_date: 2017-07-14 20:06:28
Maybe I am nuts, but wouldn't it make sense to move towards a hybrid resolution with big and small blocks together?- where the first 6 confirmations are by way of big block supercomputers, with the remaining confirmation done by the "anybody with a raspberry pi" thus allowing for quick micro-payment confirmations via Jihan computers, but also maintaining decentralization in the process as well??
