We *could* have more money in private equity, but there are other asset classes have relatively high yield, which suck out money that otherwise could have gone to startups. That's one reason for conservativeness of fund managers, because they can (for now).

The problem in Australia is purely the one of capital, which is tied to the size of the economy (it's tiny). There are orders of magnitudes more capital in the US, and therefore more funding options at better valuations, not that Australians aren't innovators. Supply and demand. There is also some red tape around employee share options, but it's being removed by the current government.

I contend that the fact that there are multi-user transactions has little effect on the median block usage per logical transaction (i.e. per user), because the size scales up linearly with the number of outputs, so these factor cancel each other out.
What's more relevant is that typical single-user transaction today would contain more inputs, so it pushes up median transaction size.

Well, I threw arbitrage and market-making in just because it was in my head at the time, I forgot why, and I'm drunk, oh well.
Anyway, the point was, these are very well-capitalised markets with a lot of sophisticated players, and some of them perform very specific functions very efficiently, like modelling and reacting to interest rates changes (market makers will almost certainly do that, vol calcs will depend on interest rates for example).
The amount of capital and actors trading it (and hence labour put into modelling and sophistication of trading) makes all the difference.
Bitcoin is different, because it's so very thinly traded, and to put it bluntly, punters trading it on the "good news" on public exchanges are simple and don't have much money. Market is mostly moved by few actors with most capital: whales who have lot of bitcoin from early days, and miners and payment processors selling coins. Add to that the fact that bitcoin ecosystem is mostly isolated from other exchanges and asset classes, new players coming in are few and far in between, so you are stuck with existing players.
As a result, there is a lot of noise, and not a lot of trend. Trade volume (and number of actors) is just not there to create an efficient "average of minds" that makes some order book track news to the second.
@_date: 2014-12-12 02:31:44
So what?
What will Authy do with my codes? The probability of them doing that is slim because it would risk ruining the company for no particular gain. Plus it's hard because it's *two*-factor authentication, they still need usernames/passwords. The economics of malicious behaviour by them is in my favour.
The risk is just not there, so it's not worth worrying about.

*Well,* I don't *really* mean 100% isolated, by "isolated" I mean it's traded within one comparatively small group of people that don't really touch any other asset class in any significant way. It's also hard to move any meaningful capital in and out of bitcoin.
Any (non-bitcoin) exchanges have many competing trading desks doing arbitrage, market-making and whatnot, markets in general have capital flowing from one asset class to another, there are tons of instos, ETF providers, retail investors, etc, so they all have the large number of actors trading, which add up to some general sentiment.

They still need usernames/passwords, so the risk of exploitation is still very low. It's hard to even pair codes to credentials. 2FA doesn't mean codes will never leak, it eliminates the single point of failure. You need both password AND the code for an attack.
If you have an Authy insider or hacker that can undetectably compromise both of your codes and credentials and can target a particular service, it's a very sophisticated attack that's more trouble than it's worth financially.

Oh, please. That's the typical American/libertarian-centric "Australians are statist convicts" stereotype, and a complete and utter hogwash. Nothing could be further from the truth. There is plenty of criticism, in fact it's a national pastime.
As for "government ruining your business", in fact, the government is **helping** tech startups by matching the funding they get from private sources (in some sectors) and offering a hefty R&amp;D tax rebate. It's the things that kept startups I worked for afloat.
It all boils down to these things:
1. No glut of excessive capital like in the US due to tiny economy.
2. Tiny population in general, and hence tiny market for a lot startups to bother with. There *are* startups that are oriented on Australian market, but they exit for less than startups in bigger markets.
3. We are far away from everybody, awkwardly located from other Western consumers, and not close enough culturally to Asia to compete in these markets, where they have strong tech offers domestically. So technology services export is hard, unless you have presence in US/Europe.

Yes, zero-click policy isn't such a great idea, but you could easily fix it with a Yes/No prompt with the amount required, or something to this effect.
A bigger problem is the culture of getting free shit. Few people on the Internet are willing to pay for viewing articles, the rest cry "paywall!" and click back. It can work for more premium content, like live PPV, but you don't really need *micro*payments there.

How would you price in 3600-coin inflation?
For the sake of the argument, if bitcoin constantly goes down with 100% certainty, then the perfect price would be 0. But it isn't because it's bought because of anticipated growth. Buyers *could* price in inflation by offsetting their growth rate expectations down and buying at a certain discount. So inflation being priced-in and constant sell pressure are not really mutually exclusive.
With that said, in reality, of course, nobody has a goddamn clue what bitcoin is worth, so it's all reading tea leaves and fibonacci accordeons by unsophisticated traders with lots of unknowns, so nothing is ever "priced in".

This exchange does not maintain internal client accounts, so users have to send money directly to each other out of band *for each trade*. Transferring in instalments (as they detail in the video) makes it even slower. I'm assuming they also want on-chain bitcoin transactions with confirmations, so it's even slower. Plus it may be hard to automate depending on the payment system in use.
As a result, order execution is *far* from immediate, so market maker's risk of price moving against them goes way up, so they will have to widen the spread to compensate.
For a similar model, look LocalBitcoins, and compare with Bitstamp (an actual exchange).
Bitstamp has from a few cents to $1 spread (depending on how much you want to buy/sell). In my city on LocalBitcoins I see **$30 spread**, that's ridiculous.

Only imports are cheaper. Internal prices are still in CHF and things cost the same.
Their exports, on the other hand, will take a hit, because they will be less competitive internationally, and domestically will have to compete with cheap imports. So Swiss companies lose. If their economy weakens, they will be less attractive as a safe haven, so they will experience an outflow of capital and suddenly become poorer (CHF goes back down, net result is a drained economy).
So, they are *temporarily* more wealthy, and just for buying abroad and foreign investments.

Don't get me wrong, they *can* make money through industry-specific ads, but they absolutely won't survive on it alone, it would be more like local business brochures in the airport in a tourist spot. Agents are more plausible, I agree, although again, it would not be the only source of revenue.

As long as a few investments are spectacularly successful, they will cover all the failures in the portfolio and more.

Sure, but I think it doesn't help you *that* much if you want to price in risk into value, because you don't know what actors own them.
Say with stocks, it's a bit easier. Certain percentage of any given stock will be owned by ETF providers, pension funds, retail investors, these numbers can be roughly estimated, and these actors all have a certain goals and behaviour tendencies. Institutional buyers and funds tend to be more systematic and disciplined in their trading.
Having a lot of dormant coins around, on the other hand, is like sitting on a powder keg. Fuck knows who owns all these long-term coins, Satoshi alone has 7% of all coins. You don't know who they are, what their goal is, and when/if they are going to pull the trigger.

That takes an awful lot of cooperation. If I set the fee to 0.1 instead of 0.01, it won't compel the miners to turn on their hardware. It takes *everyone* who wants to send money will do the same, so the fees are in the same ballpark as lost miner revenue.

Where did I say I hate the technology? Stop putting words in my mouth. My original post was skeptical about their ability to bring in revenue with ad business and you jumped down my throat about how I hate bitcoin or something. Or did I kill your firstborn?
There is a good reason to be skeptical, because ad business is really fucking hard. You *do* need a huge ad inventory (aka users) if you are hoping to do survive on ads alone, because very few users react to ads. They cannot even mine user data the way Google and Facebook do, so they targeting will be worse and they will have to sell ad space cheaper.
And yes *bitcoin* remittance is super fucking niche. You completely ignored the bit where it's targeted at a single geographic region, and only a subset people who are travelling outside the country. You do the math.
All things considered, they are very unlikely to monetise through ads, and it won't change if you close your eyes and wish very hard.
So, this is why the question still remains, how are they making money or plan to make money? Hell, I'd even accept the answer "we are not monetising yet, we are just grabbing market share and racking up user base," that's what 99% of startups do. But they are being very cagey and defensive, and it does look shady.

Yes, we have no idea, so we cannot assume they have things under control. Especially when silence is so deafening. If they had a real solution, they'd write a post-mortem already or said one is coming.
So no, it's not wrong. Not more wrong than the opposite, until more information is available. And keeping quiet certainly doesn't help their case. You have to assume the worst here until they speak up.


I don't. But that's not a good enough reason to not call them out on poor communication.


Then they'd say explicitly that they are unable to discuss the details, rather than throwing around vague platitudes (*that* is standard).
From my experience in system administration and their explanations of what they did so far, I can conclude with reasonable certainty their deployment was such a mess that they are not 100% sure what happened yet. Not exactly confidence-inspiring.

Well, I'm not excusing WU here. I'd still firmly plant the practice in the "lie by omission" category. Yes, it's technically the truth, but it's deliberately designed to misrepresent reality. WU do mention they make money on spread, but they do their best to make it as hard to find as possible. Definitely disingenuous, at the very least.
Compare to, say, actual foreign exchanges, that have buy and sell price per currency on display. My bank shows their fx buy/sell prices as well for international debit/credit card transactions.


Or they could be simply buying it at below market bid, so they could immediately sell at market bid for a profit by crossing the spread.
I tried comparing their site to Bitstamp. It's hard right now because price is moving around so much, and Bitstamp's order book changes more frequently than rates at Rebit's site, but from multiple comparisons it looks this way to me.
It also doesn't help that the rate they use to calculate the transfer is different from their side bar (e.g. if you paste their USD rate in the transfer amount, and set it to USD, bitcoin amount will not be equal to 1, although it should).

I was with you until the science bit...


Science is about evidence, it's not a "debate".
It's OK to challenge something, when you have solid evidence, or if you are willing to put in actual research work on finding evidence. Consensus does not mean some scientists high-five each other over clever talking points, as they agree on their pet theory. Consensus forms when scientists independently come to the same or similar conclusion based on data from their studies.
Sure, there is noise in data, studies vary in quality, scientists are people and make mistakes, but when multiple people independently research the same topic, or reproduce others' results, over time a body of evidence accumulates in favour of a particular hypothesis.
["There are two sides to every story" is an anti-vaxer type logic.]( Debate for the sake of being contrarian is not science, it's hot air.
So, I'd go out on a limb and say that, if you deny a hypothesis that has years or decades of research with evidence in favour of it (and little evidence on the contrary), produced by unrelated institutions and people, then yes, you are definitely anti-science.
