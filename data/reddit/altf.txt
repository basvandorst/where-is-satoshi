!RemindMe 1 year This reminder is from a thread where LN held 1.5btc total capacity, just breached 100 mainnet nodes. 1.5 btc capacity means the combined value of all channels is 1.5 bitcoins. If there are 225 channels, then on average each channel has 0.007 bitcoins in it, or about $80 (as of when I write this). If each node is owned by one person, then on average each person on the lightning network has put about .015 bitcoins total into hot wallets on this network, or about $172 each.

Get on board with a UASF blocksize increase in the coming months or years.
Even with SegWit and even with Lightning, we will need to increase the blocksize at some point. People like me prefer an algorithmic solution; any will work.
I have staunchly opposed Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin ABC, Bitcoin Cash, and all such hostile, miner-led hard forks not because of their goal (blocksize increase) but because of their political nature (and origins!)
I implore you: do not oppose something for the wrong or for no reason at all.
A blocksize increase is on the table, but only under strong consensus: for this, we will need you for the coming UASF to that effect.
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:08:32
It goes back to the Hong Kong Agreement.
In Hong Kong, 2 core "representatives" (many other Core members begged them not to go) agreed to provide hard fork blocksize increase code after SegWit was activated. Miners agreed to run Core.
BitMain, Huobi, OkCoin and another miner then launched Bitcoin Unlimited (iirc) and decided to vote via block coinbase messages, breaking the agreement.
Then the UASF materializes to force the miners to adopt SegWit or get forked.
Bitcoin ABC, a Chinese funded project, later announces that it will launch Bitcoin Cash on the same date as the UASF in response.
Barry Silbert of the Digital Currency Group (DCG) arranged a meeting between business leaders.  They agree to activate SegWit immediately and also hard fork. They explicitly create a competing Bitcoin full node client that completely bypasses/ignores the BIP process and peer review.
It makes a myriad of bad decisions and it turns out that in the end it was a buggy piece of shit that would never have worked in it's released state (fact.)
Is that a good summary?

1) With Bitcoin, yes.
2) See above.
3) Bitcoin uses Coinjoin right now, Tumblebit soon, and MimbleWimble sometime in the future.
Other coins use other techniques in order to give different answers to 1) and 2) above--that is, at least one other cryptocurrency has achieved anonymity.
DASH is a bitcoin clone that has taken the coinjoin concept to the extreme, except it has a transparent side as well as an obfuscated side; there is no anonymity by default, just like with bitcoin.
Monero [XMR], on the other hand, is a cryptocurrency that is private by default because it implements Ring Confidential Transactions.
Several other cryptocurrencies claim to have achieved privacy, including Shadow [SDC] (shadowproject.io,) any Monero clones like Aeon [AEON] or BipCoin [BIP], and many other CryptoNight-based coins (Monero is a CryptoNight-based coin)

The true path towards massive growth is to maintain our 1MB blocksize cap and implement payment channels eg. Lightning Network, which will finally implement Bitcoin's original promise and the early-day reality of "instant, (nearly-) free transactions."
Within six to eight months we'll see it implemented on the main net and the growth you're talking about will be possible.  Blocksize-increasing HF's are simply kicking the can down the road--not a true solution.

A hard fork cannot be imposed.  Miners must vote with their hashrate and users must vote with the software they use to run their full node.
@_date: 2016-06-22 15:16:49
Perhaps!  I would not mind larger blocks down the line, but for the time being 8MB is a hard stopping point, not a starting point towards 20MB.
We can scale the system while maintaining 1MB (or smaller) blocks.  LN is cheaper, safer, and has throughput that can make Bitcoin a truly global currency.

@_date: 2016-06-22 17:56:02
Overall I'm definitely open to a 2MB fork down the road, but I think that for the time being 8MB would be an upper limit for me.
Larger blocksizes will directly impact decentralization...  And the increased bandwidth, storage, and processing costs brought by larger blocks will be priced in.
The ultimate dream is to bring bitcoin to the unbanked masses--the billions of people not currently within the grasp of the global financial industry.
The unbanked increasingly have access to mobile phones, so they will be able to interface with bitcoin via SPV/light clients.  But when they're making $0.40 payments daily, $0.05 fees are untenable.
Lightning Network has the potential to *utterly slash* fees and return us to the early days of nearly-free transactions.
I see your point about there not being room in 1MB blocks for the transactions to open/close channels.  Good point.
We'll see what the best course of action is after LN comes into being!  Now that CLTV has been activated, we're one step closer to seeing it actually compete with vanilla/core.  I'm confident that competition will reveal the best path!

This is false.  You can currently hash with a 2GB card, although soon the DAG will exceed this and 2GB cards will hash slower (if they can hash at all--wolf0 and genoil seem to say that there are workarounds that will extend these cards' lifespan.)  There is no (or negligible) difference in speed between 2, 3, 4, or 8GB cards currently.
Also, there is no power to accept soft or hard forks in Ethereum that does not also exist in Bitcoin.  Ethereum's blockchain and mining community are both younger and smaller than Bitcoin's, however, so a fork is much easier to bring about politically than would be in Bitcoin's case.

wallets to upgrade. These are naive suggestions, as they will exacerbate

So you don't want all wallets to have to upgrade, but all nodes having to upgrade is fine...
A major argument for hard forks over soft forks is that soft forks are coercive and provide little to no user choice, whereas hard forks present a clear choice for the user--without strong two-way replay protection, that argument is much less meaningful.

SegWit as implemented currently differs from it's originally-proposed form in that it weights data differently, effectively increasing blocksize.  This change was made as a compromise in order to appease those that wanted a higher blocksize limit and it also disincentivizes growing the UTXO.

Because by *default* he will only see that one address--everyone else's answers (including mine) are *technically* correct, though--he has to be seriously technically capable (not to mention malicious) in order to derive other keys from that single datapoint.

I would disagree with that electrum is insecure; not only have I used it personally for years and never had a loss, it is recommended as the light (or SPV) client of choice in security-conscious circles and has been for a long time.
You should be aware that your public addresses are leaked to the Electrum server your client connects to (in order for them to query balances.) There is no guarantee that you are connecting to a 'good' client--but all they can do is know which addresses are correlated with one another. They cannot spend for you.
You can manually set your server or set one up yourself and only connect with that.

Although it's not recommended for privacy's sake (and not just yours,) address reuse eliminates excessive inputs and therefore larger tx sizes.
You may not realize the significance of this rate, but just stick with 20-40 satoshis per kb and you'll be fine (if you're OK with waiting up to a few hours for a confirmation.)  That should equate to 0.0001-2 BTC, or 0.00012ish per input.

glockbtc and jcoinner have provided the more accurate answers that if you disclose a private key and your master public key, other private keys can be extrapolated from that information.
Luke-jr's answer is thus incomplete or arguably incorrect, however it is the most cautious.  A sole private key is not enough information to discern the others, but you should use caution and just spin up a fresh wallet for him. It's not that hard.
@_date: 2016-12-28 18:41:51
Bitcoin uses key*pairs*, so for every private key there is a public key that is its twin.  Bitcoin addresses are hashes (two rounds, really) of the public key.  You can give out your public-key-based bitcoin address freely and nobody should be able to derive the private key (needed for spending) from that information.
For privacy and safety, most bitcoin wallets make new keypairs for you for every transaction.  They generate these pairs based on your seed.  It is safest to always use new addresses, but if you send to the same address you used before the funds should appear.
Sorry if that's all a little arcane, but I did gloss over a lot of details... there's a lot going on under the hood in bitcoin but it really can be understood in 10-15 minutes if you have a grasp of the fundamentals!

@_date: 2016-12-24 05:57:40
That's rough, transactions cost the same no matter how little dollar value the inputs happen to be--all miners care about is the digital size of the tx, not the economic value. Are all those 18 tx to unique addresses or are they all to a single address? If it's the latter, the fee is absurd.  If it's the former... You can expect to pay 0.0018(ish) according to naïve/dumb (helpful) wallets.
Another commented recommended 70 satoshis per kb--just go with 30-40 if you can afford to wait.
0.0005 to 0.0009 would be a cheap price to be pay to consolidate 18 inputs into a new single output.

The latest Electrum does not allow custom fees without modifications, but if does allow dynamic fees with customizable 'priority' (you can slide it to try and be confirmed immediately or up to 25 blocks from now, according to an algorithm) as well as replace-by-fee
Coinb.in is browser-based and I would not recommend it for security's sake--you have to work with raw/unencrypted private keys, which isn't smart in general.  Too many openings for attackers to eavesdrop and swipe your coin.

It is recommended in security-conscious circles because it generates and encrypts your wallet locally but does not have to sync the full blockchain.  Instead, it relies on open-source electrum servers, of which there are many.  These servers don't do anything for the electrum client except query address balances and push transactions.  For more information, do your own research at  *ie.:*






















But while it is pedantically true that neither my personal lack of loss nor what's recommended are reasons that it's secure, *the community's collective lack of loss* over the 5 years of Electrum's existence do speak to its efficacy as a tool.
It's just a tool, though.  It's up to you to know how it should be used.

It is recommended that your seed never touches an internet-connected computer--even in an encrypted form.
However... I will admit that in practice I, like you plan to, use passphrase encryption in addition to storing the encrypted seed(s) 'safely.'
But you should definitely be aware that Bitcoin experts recommend that you simply never let your seed touch an internet-connected computer, even in an encrypted form.

Ok so in order to understand the significance of inputs and outputs you kind of have to understand that the entire purpose/fundamental concept of Bitcoin is that it's an up-to-date list of which addresses hold bitcoins.
This list is the UTXO set, or Unspent Transaction Output set.
Transactions are lists of inputs (UTXO entries) and outputs. If a single input is not large enough to satisfy the desired output(s), you must include multiple. Multiple outputs are usually used (change addresses and so on) unless the transaction is meant to consolidate multiple inputs into a single output.
Or you can do away with the concept of inputs and outputs and consider all inputs to be outputs.
They're all just UTXO entries.

Essentially yes, this means that on this particular exchange, a $250k market-buy will raise the price to $1,000.

Channels are permissionless and decentralized.  They involve 'refund' transactions which are typically not broadcast, but which can be broadcast on the normal bitcoin blockchain that we all know and love as a backup in case any third-party (or second-party, even) intermediaries are uncooperative or otherwise unreachable due to technical lapses on their end.
There is no possibility that Lightning will be the vector for confiscation of coins any more than currently: that is, they could run a payment hub and potentially track coin movement just like they could run their own Silk Road.  But actually the situation is markedly better, because there are methods in the works whereby the destination and even the source of funds in Lightning transactions can be made opaque (or at least translucent) to the third parties doing any routing.

In short, no.  No because this feature is built right into bitcoin itself.
I would recommend using CheckSequenceVerify and **not** nLockTime.  CheckSequenceVerify will allow your transaction to be confirmed immediately (normally, anyways,) whereas nLockTime (IIRC) will make your transaction stay in the mempool for, well, nLockTime.

You can't specifically target the mining equipment that Bitmain uses: you must change away from SHA256, period, which impacts everyone equally...  Well, almost equally, but not in the way we'd like: Bitmain's accumulated warchest and familiarity with the design and fabrication process probably makes them best-positioned to make the first ASICs for whatever new algorithm is chosen.
I also fully oppose Bitmain, but alas, it's not so easy to purge them as we might hope.
@_date: 2017-04-09 06:53:46
Ah, there is no such thing, it's just that if you submit a transaction at any random time, it could be just after a block, in the middle of a block's work, or just before a block is solved.  So while your tx could take 10 minutes, it could also take 15.  Or 20.  Or, as we all know, 30 minutes, an hour, two hours, and so on.
I suppose I've been taking for granted that the tx in question would have a 'competitive' fee, ie. one that would get it into the next block--which should always be rising as demand outstrips supply (as it should if blocks are artificially limited to 1MB, as I think we agree it should not be...  I just don't like BU's Emergent Consensus and would prefer an adaptive blocksize solution that's predictable.)
Perhaps I have my statistics a bit wrong and it should always take about 10 minutes, not 15...
@_date: 2017-04-08 01:07:41
Yes, absolutely, as the additional use-cases enabled by SegWit would make it increasingly economically advantageous to miners to collect the fees of SW transactions.

Please explain your thought some more, if you don't mind.
Am I a gatekeeper for currently market-making in joinmarket?  To be clear (if you aren't familiar,) it is a decentralized marketplace for making coinjoins through which I am paid a fee for offering my coins up to those that wish to replace their coins with mine.  I effectively receive 1-2% interest on my bitcoins annually.
Once LN is live, I will do the same thing.  Will I be a gatekeeper for enabling nearly-instant, nearly-free transactions?  Does charging a minuscule fraction of what a main-chain tx would cost (be aware, LN nodes will experience a race to the bottom in terms of fees as nodes compete for volume, driving the price down to as cheap as is economical) make me gatekeeper, or a market-maker?

While I do use altcoins with adaptive blocksizes daily (like Monero,) I'm not sure how I feel about similar systems being ported over to bitcoin proper.  As u/jonny1000 mentioned, it is trivially gameable (as trivial as it is to produce a valid block, anyways.)
I support an algorithmic blocksize cap increase as mentioned in the OP, but more aggressive than those stated figures.
@_date: 2017-04-24 20:07:41
Thanks for bringing your concerns here!
BU stands for Bitcoin Unlimited, an alternative client that supports a contentious hardfork if 75% of blocks are flagged as supporting it.
BTU is the currency symbol for Bitcoin Unlimited coins in the event of a hard fork (where Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Unlimited split the network into two 'chains)
SegWit is Segregated Witness, a protocol upgrade that separates signatures from transactions and stores them instead in a block's coinbase transaction, which solves a transaction malleability, a vulnerability that's been in bitcoin since its beginning.  In accordance with BIP9, SegWit will not activate unless 95% of blocks are flagged as supporting it, unless...
UASF is User-Activated Soft Fork, another alternative client which will, after a certain point in time, reject all blocks which do not signal for SegWit.
Fiat currency is a term for national currencies...  But that's not exactly accurate and you're better off googling it.
Did that help?

BU's hashrate goes back up.
@_date: 2017-04-07 03:20:10
Segwit was released in 0.13. 0.13 was the first segwit-capable Core version; in 0.13.1, segwit transactions &amp;etc. were enabled if the node detected that segwit had been activated (95% of blocks signalling support over the last activation period, I forget the exact amount of blocks that is at the moment.)
The recent UASF "fork" (tiny changes: see github.com/UASF) ignores all non-segwit blocks after August 1st (date may be pushed back in order to avoid UASF nodes being isolated on a dead chain.)  2% of all nodes are currently signalling for UASF and 80% of all nodes are segwit-capable/Core 0.13 or above (&gt;99% of nodes are capable of at least interacting with segwit nodes via legacy UTXOs, the entire point of deploying it as a soft fork.)
@_date: 2017-04-08 18:01:26
You will still be able to make a cheap bitcoin tx on chain.  LN hubs allow *off-chain* transactions which can be broadcast back to the main chain at any time for security, but which can stay entirely off-chain (except for opening and closing channels, of course) and are entirely voluntary to use.
@_date: 2017-04-09 02:36:15
Maybe this will explain it better: here, I will grant you that with more transactions fitting into a block, the average confirmation time over all transactions will decrease.  But blocks will still be produced once every ten minutes on average.  So if your transaction has a fee which is high enough to make it into the next block, the block time will still be 10 minutes on average.  Take into account that you're likely to be midway between blocks and average confirmation time is still 10-15 minutes no matter how big the blocks are.
Does that explain it better?
@_date: 2017-04-08 17:38:44

I would support a blocksize increase today, but **not** BU's "Emergent Consensus" implementation.  An algorithmically-determined adaptable blocksize would seem best in my opinion, as I do at least agree with many in the BU camp that I'd prefer a single blocksize hardfork than a series/several.

I do.  I could mark you.
Litecoin is very close to activating segwit... but honestly I don't see why.  Their blocks are nowhere near to full.  They don't really *need* the extra throughput that segwit would provide.
I guess if it's a good thing when blocks are full, it would be a good thing regardless, but beyond serving as a testbed for bitcoin's eventual activation of segwit I still don't see why it would be necessary for them.

@_date: 2017-04-08 17:41:54
[Here's the FAQ]( which may answer your question, but the jist of it is that yes, RBF is something that is marked in the tx and all RBF transactions must be flagged as such--BU simply does not respect that flag, however.  It is important to note that RBF is backwards-compatible, so old clients relay them as regular transactions.
If the first tx is too low on fees, yes, it will be dropped.  The first tx must have a high enough fee so as not to get dropped immediately.
I'm working on a script but it won't exactly be user-friendly...  I think the best you can do for now is to use Bitcoin Knots or Electrum.

The FAQ at uasf.co answers this question nicely!  You're right, if a minority of nodes run the UASF client then you (we) will be on a lonely chain.
0.14-UASF *is* 0.14-Core, so the data will be interchangeable.  You'll be able to switch back without any hiccups whatsoever (I have tested this fact.)

Most of us sane developers and users agree that blocksize increase is needed at some point, and many (including myself) would welcome that change **today.**  But Bitcoin Unlimited's so-called "Emergent Consensus" implementation is total horseshit.  You don't need to read many opinions on it, you don't need to watch many talks, you can read the bare fucking code for youself.  Admittedly, understanding it is a bit harder...  And you may end up needed to read other peoples' assessments (and opinions) after all, but if you're reading this then I'm confident that you can use the internet to learn to understand bitcoin's code in a shorter time than you might expect.

Gemini is doing auctions
@_date: 2016-09-23 02:41:24
Bitcoin is now being auctioned by Gemini the same way that other assets are auctioned on other major financial institutions, which isn't in itself revolutionary or anything, but allows for large orders to be made publicly with less slippage and fees than previously.
Before this, Over-The-Counter trades could cost 1-2% and be cancelled by the bitcoin seller (market maker;) these auctions, on the other hand, have very low fees and use pre-funded accounts so the maker cannot back out (the buyer, or taker, is assured of the purchase.)  In addition, they require less identification and contact than OTC trades, which can even involve a phonecall.
Not trying to shill for Gemini or anything (I'm not on the platform,) but it is interesting nonetheless.  Takeaway: day 2 saw a slight volume increase and a rise in price by ~$2.00.

The grandparent may have been referring to Decred's system, where stakers can accept a block as valid but strip the miner of their reward.  This is not the same as in Bitcoin, where if the block is rejected, it cannot be used for securing the chain at all (invalid=doesn't confirm any transactions.)
For example, you could accept empty blocks as valid, but not pay the miner for them.  Does that make sense?
@_date: 2018-02-25 10:43:53
Bitcoin is permissionless. Even with the same base layer, I believe that a second (or higher) layer could implement hybrid PoW/PoS (like Decred's system, for example.). If it is valuable, it will survive.  And I believe that it would because it is.
@_date: 2018-02-25 10:51:10
Not on the base layer. It could be used on a higher layer without permission.

As iPoopedJustNow wrote "As markovcd wrote "as notthematrix wrote "as hanakookie wrote "Notice none of the signers of the NYA are doing anything to help or review the code. Not a single company has contributed a single resource. And the rebase to 0.15.0 is a last ditch effort to copy code that works. Basically abandoning the code Jeff copied. It's complete non sense that any rational businessman would continue this effort with or without replay. So when Core updates to 0.15.1 is Jeff going to rebase to that one too. " Bitcoin needs to be stable and tested , btc1 is not its copy paste development not what you want for a billion worth crypto currency. BTC1 shows copy paste development." I agree with above statement."

That is not what the devs who were invited *then explicitly disinvited* say.
Between suits and devs--and especially devs that I hear from and talk to regularly--I'll trust devs every time.
And you're basically saying that Core devs are liars, because your story is completely different from theirs.
@_date: 2017-10-04 03:36:21
Incorrect, S2X has not rebased up to 0.15.0 and just as they do, 0.15.1 will be out, and so on and so forth: with just a handful of developers, S2X will always lag behind and never be able to innovate.
Moreover, as opt-in replay protection only, it by-default attempts to assume the mantle of "actual" Bitcoin and masquerades as the standard implementation.
Most of us (including myself) agree that we should increase the blocksize at some point, but the actual hands-on experts almost completely agree that this timeline is much, much too quick.  The sponsors of the developers implementing this change have stated multiple times and in multiple places that this change is not so much about the blocksize as it is about unseating Core as the primary Bitcoin development group.  The agreement to make this change, called the New York Agreement, was made behind closed doors between less than 30 people and requires an upgrade of every client in order to be effective.  The Core developers were expressly not consulted, nor their extreme concerns relayed to any of the signatories (who were assured that the developers we're in support.)
If less than 30 people can force a change against the wishes of the users and the developers, what chance do we have to resist government influence?
None of that mentions the vested interest the lead developer, Jeff Garzik (jgarzik) has in merging his company's Bitcoin nodes into the hardcoded seeds of the S2X client: his company is a blockchain analytics provider that seeks to correlate transactions with users and essentially unmask/deprivatize users/transactions.  By merging his nodes into S2X hardcoded seeds, he will be guaranteed the best data possible on the IP address origin of transactions, to name just one benefit.  Look up Bloq and Chainalysis.
Garzik has not been active in Bitcoin development in years.  This is his chance to get back in the limelight and benefit his own company at the same time.
The timing of the change thus absolutely matters, as this change is not a simple technical change but rather an almost-totally political move to try and wrest control of the first and best decentralized currency from the hands of its creators and maintainers into the clutches of businessmen and, ultimately, government.

Jamie Cansdale's branch was the actual work merged. 
His code is at github.com/jcansdale and he is  on Twitter.
This opt-in replay protection provides a method for S2X-exclusive transactions, but does not provide any method for making Core-only tx, replaying standard tx by default.
@_date: 2017-10-04 04:46:59
Update: please see 
This method of replay protection requires adding an additional *blacklisted* output address to the tx you wish to replay-protect.
They are thus introducing a blacklist and requiring Core users to send bloated tx in order to implement replay-protection.
This is such a mess.

Hierarchical  Deterministic (HD) wallets are a method for generating any number of fresh (unused) addresses from a single private key, seed, mnemonic phrase, etc.  So each customer can pay to their own address, and get another fresh address for their next payment (while still allowing them to send to any old address.)
EDIT: oh, and you can generate them from an extended public key (xpub, ypub, or zpub,) which never puts private keys at risk.

Bitcoin that hasn't been mined yet doesn't exist at any address. In order to spend address's coins, you have to have the address's associated private key... But if coins haven't been mined yet, they won't be at any address at all yet.

First, and sorry if this sounds like I'm talking down to you, because I don't mean to, but do you understand that you may not need to run a full node? You may be fine running a pruned node or (better yet) what called an SPV client. Electrum is a popular and well-tested example.

Right, any increase in resources raises the cost of node operation (CONOP) and should be well-tested before rolling it out.

What about Bitcoin is simple to you?
Why mix everything together? So we don't fuck this up.
A hard fork is no simple matter. If we do it simply, we get no replay protection and are guaranteed a legacy chain.
The agreement to which 80% of hashrate agreed specifically stipulates that it all occur simultaneously.

Looking at  it seems that the vast majority of those nodes have been shut off.
6 hours ago a spike of ~1000 UASF nodes were added to the network.
Just over 2 hours ago, that number started winding down.
At this point there are about 200 more nodes than before this event started.
We don't need fake nodes, folks.  We need real people messaging Core, their exchanges, and the mining community at large.
EDIT: another spike in node count happened later and is currently winding down... I really don't look forward to this being used as fodder that the UASF as a whole is astro-turfed (cue r/BTC in 3... 2... 1...) FUCK.

Your input is valued and the fact remains that you can still reject the 2mB hard fork just as always, but this agreement gets the miners that agreed to the Consensus 2017 accords to the BIP148 UASF table, giving it the highest change of success.
All BIP148 UASF supporters should support this.
And we are free to reject the 2mB hard fork after we activate SegWit on August 1st.

Changing the PoW algo would be a tool for a specific task, but I wonder about the ramifications of restarting the ASIC race.
We haven't even had time to produce a FOSS ASIC.
Or perhaps, if PoW is changed, it's changed *to* a FOSS (copyleft-licensed) hash itself...  A CPU- and GPU-minable (memory-bound) algo that the community immediately begins designing, fabricating, and distributing ASICs for dedicated miners (in it for years)

This proposal ("COOP") activates vanilla BIP148 UASF on August 1st and is why I support it.
The fact remains that users could still (somewhat duplicitiously) reject the 2mB hard fork, but exchanges are likely to move with the miners, unfortunately.

Satoshi's original client also broke after block sizes over 0.5 mB, so have fun with that.

Lol, dude, bitcoin is barely 8 years old.
We can and we will change the PoW if the miners don't get it through their tiny heads that they work for **us**.
I don't give a fuck how much some bourgeoisie dumped into silicon.  Bitcoin is an electronic peer to peer cash system and cash's only purpose is to serve the development of human civilization by abstracting labor value into a freely exchangeable form: if they start inhibiting our ability to freely transact--including inhibiting our ability to form free and voluntary contracts *off-chain* (safely backed by the primary layer in a non-malleable form)--then they'll be fired, period.

Simply abstain from transactions before August 1st and just for a few days. The UASF will be over, successful or otherwise, very quickly.
The other wallet I would recommend (Electrum) also supports the UASF, though :P
@_date: 2017-05-11 18:57:12
I also would not be happy.  I do recognize the need for larger blocks (and would fork--soft *or* hard--today,) but would rather fork to a "final" blocksize solution (algorithmic/predictable growth) rather than just kicking the can down the road.
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:59:16

The famous first transaction was 10,000 BTC for a single pizza: 10,000 BTC / 50 BTC/block * 10 min/block = 2000 minutes, or 33.33 hours (in the best-case scenario) spent hashing for a single pizza.
Without an economic majority to give it value, miners' PoW doesn't even provide sustenance wages: 33.33~ hours of mining was worth a single pizza--barely enough to survive.
Bitcoin is valuable because of the users and the use cases, not because the miners add any value other than securing the order of transactions--a service for which they are paid in bitcoin.
Miners are employees.  Their employers are king.

As long as this activates BIP148 UASF, individual nodes can maintain a 1mB max blocksize as always.
I am advocating for this solution on both sides of the debate in order to ensure that BIP148 UASF is successful and SegWit is activated in August.
As for increasing the blocksize, I support an increase in principle but find a 2mB hard-edge blocksize to be asinine.  I'd prefer another number (or preferably, an algorithm.)

Please read me again, I'm saying: as long as we/*they* activate SegWit on/by August 1st via BIP148 UASF, the users can ultimately choose to 'rebel' against COOP after SegWit is activated and before the hard fork takes place (six months after hard fork lock-in,) maintaining a small block chain in a situation where both chains now have SegWit.

Yes, I absolutely do know that beyond a shadow of a doubt.
Scaling on-chain for 2 transactions per day for 7 billion people would require 24 GB blocks.  20 transactions per day, 240 GB blocks.
With Lightning, we can support all 7 billion people on planet earth with ~144 MB blocks for literally infinite transactions--2, 20, 200, the blocksize would not increase.


Lightning is 100% backed by PoW and you obviously do not know what you're talking about.


Leaving the limit at 1000000 is idiotic, and betting bitcoin's future on "additional layers" that have zero users today and no end user demand is pure lunacy. Only someone who has never built a business or released a product that is popular would see "additional layers" as the next step in bitcoin's evolution.
You're arguing with someone that also wants larger blocks, but not BU's bullshit.
I am a programmer.  If you aren't, I'd appreciate it if you just shut the fuck up with your stupid bullshit.  Raising the blocksize is kicking the can down the road, so the speak, and is not a solution whatsoever.  Additional layers **are** the solution.

Well, I support this in principle, but it does give 6000000 bytes to SegWit, which others may yet be opposed to.
As for me, I think a hard fork to 2mB is next to pointless except insofar as it prepares the ecosystem to hardforks.
I do agree that, *in spirit*, this is what was agreed to.  But I also don't take it for granted that these suits knew the details of SegWit (and that's a shameful admission, really, and pretty depressing.)

The only reference in the source text to Bitmain's UAHF with regards to your assertion that "it is only about what happens if the NY agreement fails" is


SegWit2x's schedule is as follows (source: 
       June 16 - Alpha Milestone
       - Alpha software ready
    
       June  30 - Beta Milestone
       - Testing complete
    
       July 14 - Agreement Participants Install and Test Milestone
       
       July 21- Nodes Running &amp; Signaling begins
With SegWit2x signalling beginning on July 21st, there is simply no time for a signalling period to conclude before the August 1st UASF date.
This UAHF plan is in response to the existing BIP148 UASF plan and both will go ahead (well, if Bitmain acts on this plan.)
According to this statement they will not be using SegWit as it currently exists in their UAHF.
Whether they "compromise" on this matter or not will, of course, be seen in due time.

Hi there!  Welcome.  Thanks for asking!
Your english is just fine, by the way :) or good enough, anyways.
First off, it may be a bit confusing, but Bitcoin Classic is its own (old) thing.  What you call "classic" bitcoin is probably Bitcoin Core: github.com/bitcoin, that is.
It is arguable whether Bitman's "btc 2.0" (**SegWit2X**) will be "faster, better and so on"--it will have larger blocksizes, yes, which means that between two and eight times the amount of transactions can be confirmed in the same amount of time.  So in one sense it will be the same speed: confirmations will still occur on average every 10 minutes; but practically speaking, you will probably get confirmed quickly because more transactions will be confirmed per block.  In my personal opinion it will not be better *in general* because it (currently) lacks the support of the world-grade programmers that have given Bitcoin the quality it has today.  But perhaps most of them will join the Bitmain-led change...
Anyways, there should be the same amount of bitcoin available on each chain (21,000,000.)  *But* there may be multiple chains!  They will probably all call themselves the "real" bitcoin--and it may take quite a while to ascertain which is the real bitcoin... or you may just have to choose for yourself!  Don't worry--just don't make moves (or even transactions) until you've fully researched and thought through your options.
You should be able to get the "real" bitcoin on almost every currently-existing bitcoin exchange.  Some may offer both.  Stay tuned for information.
Nobody knows the price, as always.

Because in order to send funds or sign transactions, your private key needs to be exposed to an online computer (unless you sign tx/msgs from an offline computer and transfer the results to an online computer manually.)
Hardware wallets keep the private keys in the secure hardware itself and do not expose your keys to your online computer.

First of all (and bitcoin-dev IRC chat logs prove this,) Core devs were overwhelmingly against those devs going to Hong Kong because most people anticipated the shenanigans that would quickly follow (major miners broke the agreement within a week or two of signing it.)
Second of all, it stipulated that the signatory devs would do so if and only if the miner signatories continued signalling for Core; see above (miners signalled for Classic or XT IIRC.)
Third of all, the agreement specifically stipulated that **code** for a hard fork blocksize increase would be released.  And it was.  And again and again--several Core devs (as well as outsiders) have hard-forking personal branches and have submitted PRs to Core proper.  The agreement was upheld.

r/BitcoinBeginners is great :)
Hardware wallets are generally recommended because they hold your *private key* (the secret needed to spend your funds,) preventing it from being exposed to a computer that's connected to the internet directly.
Hosted wallets (Coinbase, etc.) are the least safe, but at least it (shouldn't) mess up due to your own lack of knowledge about how to keep your own keys safe.
Personal wallets (Bitcoin core, Electrum, Mycelium, Breadwallet, Copay, Samourai Wallet) are a step safer, in that *you control the keys*, but you must also take steps to make sure you don't store them insecurely.
Hard wallets are a good "dummy-proof" solution because they guide you through the setup process, making sure to emphasize what is important to save securely (your *seed*, from which your private keys are generated, for example) while making sure that your private keys aren't leaked.
Try downloading Electrum and playing with it a bit!  Don't put all your coins in or anything, but it's a good way to get introduced to mnemonic phrases!
