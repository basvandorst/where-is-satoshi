In our company we work with blockchain technologies and we see a lot of Ethereum interest from financial markets. They have a lot of use cases where 2 or more computers should agree with something, and current technology doesn't allow to do it. With smart contracts on top of blockchain they could solve a lot of actual problems and may be do a lot of new things. In the future a program could read all the world news (I mean all even the local newspapers of all the world) and make investments small tendencies, something similar to what is called high frequency trading.

'block cain's potential reaches far beyond bitcoin the currency'. It could be used in the future to prove your the owner of a good or property. You should be able to know the owner of a property just looking to property block chain.
