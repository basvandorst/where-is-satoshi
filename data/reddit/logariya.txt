It's also not available to people. It's a gross settlement system for it's institutional clients.

You don't know how the Google search engine works ?
@_date: 2019-02-16 16:12:57
It's a gross settlement system, not unit of trade.

I don't get this meme. JPM coin has nothing to do with the network that's down. Its RTGS, not retail and treasury. Someone explain please ?

Can't believe he went that route and used the state's resources. He should have contracted private party to conduct this privately. Fucking statist.

I would probably trust Satoshi most. Its a complete coincidence of course that every time a new reveal pops up, the current highly praised and highly paid gurus and pundits in the space are quick to ensure everyone doubts it. It's almost like they are incentivized to make sure that the real Satoshi never shows. Weird.

Jesus you get butthurt from a dumb ad. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:22:28
Yeah I said you were butthurt, pretty accurate comment from my end. Chill dude.

Hey OP , you have kids and wife right ? I think at this point you need to maximize this and go straight up cash out retirement savings and the education loans. If you're gonna do it, do it right and do it all the way.
