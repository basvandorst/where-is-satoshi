how does this even happen?
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:24:12
people give me shit, but this is why I stuck with coinbase for easiness despite fee's
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:56:33
I saw the huge price drop happen.  I looked over at my bank account and I saw a lot less money than I originally had.  somehow, subconsciously, I moved more USD into BTC.  
I must say, best decision I never knew I made!
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:27:20
I'm sort of a noob when it comes to BTC and not really sure how to transfer properly from one wallet to another.  Any good guides out there on how to do it.  Afraid to get my wallet address wrong
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:22:19
Anyone know if sending or transferring your BTC from coinbase to Robinhood is an option?
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:18:12
I had super weak hands.  I can't believe I bought more coins! Kappa
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:11:19
Meanwhile I bought more BTC even though everyone was calling me an idiot
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:51:42
I believe in Bitcoin but still worried, do I hold?
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:25:59
Yeah thats true.  Waited too long now lol, Gonna have to wait till it goes back to 16 or a panic sell off happens
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:01:08
I just want another big spike down.  Not having a lot of money cause of student loans and stuff makes it hard to buy in a bunch, but if it at least went back down to 5k so I could buy more to hit .1 would be nice
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:42:14
Can I has some. I is poor
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:50:57
Obviously....my point is if it did crash, I could buy super cheap.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:11:51
I accidentally panick sold which was stupid.  I am waiting for a dip to 13k to buy in again so I make sure to not lose anything and only stand to gain when BTC sky rockets.
I really hope Bitcoin drops to 13k again even just for a little bit for me to buy
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:23:22
Does anyone believe that a massive sell-off may be coming?  I was really hoping and banking on prices to drop temporarily to around 12K or 13K
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:47:24
Do you think BTC will drop once its all working?  I want to buy back in cause i was dumb
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:19:31
Someone send me some too, im broke
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:42:38
Heard about BTC when it was like 50bucks.  Thought it was a total scam.  realized I was an idiot.  Bought in at 5k.  Sold at 14k.  realized I am an idiot again.
Now the price won't drop for me to buy back in.  FUCK

in most states, selling lemonade is illegal without a permit.  How sad is that...
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:22:44
I'm a new user!  In all honesty though, I've had a small amount of BTC for a while now, but I am still learning even what satoshi value is and how to even buy stuff with it.  It's fun learning
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:50:16
Isn't one going to die and the other live, or am I totally mistaken?
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:07:26
ah, yeah.  my bad, misunderstood you at first.  I will look into securing and transfering out of coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:35:33
Until they don't
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:49:36
The more research I did, the more I just said fuck it, buy anyways
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:33:40
Peace of mind?
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:02:23
Well, I agree but Coinbase houses it for me to as I don't know a lot about wallets and such.  They also guarantee the price you bought and/or sold at so even though it takes 8 days, I don't really see a big downside.  I am using it as investments, not everyday use.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:10:25
This was the most helpful post by far.  Thank you kind sir!
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:54:15
eh, not really, I was just getting more confused the deeper I went in researching.  Was hoping someone had a better way of explaining.  Though it's speculation, sounds like Btc will be fine
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:54:48
very true
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:00:39
Yes I can.  If I sell on coinbase, it locks it in at the sale price
