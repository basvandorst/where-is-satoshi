If your expectations were less than 11 sales, then I have little hope for black friday this year.

Ok, so lets raise it to 2mb, then 10mb, then 100mb, then 1GB.
Let's just hope that storage and network bandwidth outpace block size. Good thing laying new physical infrastructure for new network lines is as easy as updating your iPhone BitPay swiper app. Except its not.
Ironically, most of this would be solved with a hot-cache of bitcoin block chain, that way bloom filters or any of that other nonsense wouldn't be necessary. I say this is ironic, because that would imply some sort of centralization.
Believe me, raising the block size limit starts to sound like Congress and the debt limit real quick. If bitcoin is as successful as we all want it to be, that would mean planning for infinite block sizes. What would that mean? What current weaknesses exist in the protocol/spec that will have an impact on its use? What processes/trusts are in place to ensure a proper migration to the next version? Are all merchants aware of possible migration implications? What do you do if confronted with a non-compatible block-chain spec change? Are bitcoin holders left out to dry before they migrate their wallet? How would you roll that out? Certainly your wallet is hosted at this point? Wait, wasn't that the point of Bitcoin to begin with?
Start applying bitcoin as a reality, and stretch its spec to all practical limitations, and you realize it has a long way to go. Its an experiment, a toy, a prototype.
The fact that we have a 1MB block size limit and we are finding blocks at 832kb and are walking around saying "what do we do about this guys?" only proves we are either fucked, or in for a lot of work and changes. We have no proof that errors aren't already occuring at the 1MB block size. Do we have software to detect this? Do alarms go off when block sizes reach this? What happens? Fucking seriously, what happens?

Just means its not ready for primetime. Doing a centralized cryptocurrency would be difficult enough for 8 hansomely paid fulltime engineers with the latest cloud tech.

Ok I guess my question is how does the pIugin work?

The serial number in a US dollar is scanned and recorded whenit leaves the ATM. It is then again scanned and recorded when a business that accepted the cash deposits it into a bank. This information can easily be sent directly to CIA or FBI computer database systems.
With this serial number bill inflow and outflow, they can follow cash. Since drug dealers use cash, they always end up spending cash that someone else took out of an ATM. The FBI could then see that money from ATMs all over town are concentrated at the 7-11 across the street from a dealer's house because that is where he buys ciggarettes.
The Bitcoin block chain is essentially that FBI database system with all serial code transactions in it. Bitcoin's technology shares this data with the network as a full history for each coin. In this way, not only is this secret FBI database public, but instantly available on the internet as soon as the block is verified.
My comment about running away with cash is thr manual scan never happens, so the money "dissapears". With bitcoin, this is simply not possible.

Yes, its on the front of every bill. In fact, when you take $60 out of the ATM, and it always seems to gret deposited in across-town businesses you never frequent, thats when they realize your buddy is a drug dealer.
The FBI can do what this guy did, at least similarly, with cash. Ironically cash is easier to steal because you can get away and hide it, take it out of a US bank.
With bitcoins, no one hides in the blockchain.

This is a huge problem. 
First, there are the practical bandwidth and transaction issues.
Second, as bitcoin proliferates there will need to be dedicated updates to blockchain software. How do you deploy that? How can you gaurantee exchanges, merchants, and miners take updates as needed? Some updates are more disruptive than others.
Like any technical system that gathers entropy, bitcoin will be replaced by a new coin that iterates on previous weaknesses.
Arguably thats good for the system. Currencies can iterate like software and get better. I can envision a world where multiple curriencies are held by everyone.
To me, even though I hold bitcoins they arent practical. I dont trust the current system to overcome its future scaling challenges in a distributed and decentralized fashion. The self organization and coordination would need to be uncanny. As I said, im invested in case im wrong, but I understand enough to be wary of the pitfalls.

Inadequate monitoring and lack of customer service?

It works like google

Wont ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever happen.

Whats the current resolution time for something like Namecoin? How feasible is it for each request to search the blockchain? I imagine you would still cache this somewhere... which defeats the point I'd imagine? Only new entries would be fast. Do people then continue to sell their domain to themselves at another address to get further up in the chain for faster resolution times?
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:09:30
Maybe not, but if it existed, you could do the same thing with bitcoin.
