I see, I am removing all excess links that haven't been commented on and will look into the suggestion. I'm new to reddit but will take a look at the rules etc. Thank you for the information.
I have removed all excess links! Let us know if you have any more suggestions/ queries.

Sorry if you feel like we are spamming. This is our second link posted here. There was a malicious attack after we posted our first link in which someone sent a payment without the fee thus locking others out. This new thread is simply a "relaunch" of the old site with patches added. If there are other reasons to why you dislike the game please let us know, we are always listening to what people want to see added/ taken away.

I ask that you please read into the game. I had a lot of fun designing and making it, and hope you'll have a lot of fun should you decide to play it. We also have a history with Bitcoin as you can see by the provided links. The site is not a scam, just a new and MUCH better spin on an old idea. If you have any more suggestions/ queries please let us know. Our ears are always open.
