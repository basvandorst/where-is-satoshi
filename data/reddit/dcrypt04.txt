This sounds like total nonsense. If you have the key for the volume it would just be a matter of searching its contents.

Shamirs secret sharing is a relevant algorithm to this problem. Although an easier way of diving the key into 2 parts would be to convert the key to a number and then find 2 numbers; a and b where a != b and a + b = your private key. This way if someone manages to find either one of those numbers it wont give them hardly any insight into the search space.
Although if there is a way to create a paper multisig wallet, go with that.

Is this guy serious? As far as im aware bitcoiners are mainly desperate to break ASICBOOST.

How so? And wouldn't 2x drastically reduce fees? This is good for users no?
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:29:35
This... 2x!
But in all honesty, what's wrong with segwit2x? It breaks asicboost and provides much more transactions doesnt it?

I guess this is some kind of meta reference?

Maybe a good idea for a different crypto currency but bitcoin would never adopt it. Might be an interesting idea to create a currency where addresses that havent been used in x amount of time are deleted and that money goes to whoever mines the newest block at the time of deletion thus keeping the blockchain smaller and more suitable for day to day use on a cell phone or something.

Don't all exchanges have KYC requirements for large withdrawals?

Coinbase and Gemini are popular. I'd recommend breaking it up into a few transactions just incase something goes wrong. Make sure your privates keys are safe!

I agree. One of the major selling points of crypto currencies is supposed to be low transaction fees. Miners are already paid a block reward anyway. Saying that high fees are a sign of its value are like saying that a cars fuel consumption is a sign of its performance, it removes efficiency from the equation.

Why not use an exchange like Poloniex, HitBTC or Bittrex. You can likely get a much better deal.

Take good care of those keys!
