It's indeed a crock of shit, but even at their holdings as of September ($400MM USD), that puts their leverage at 5.6x, still nothing to freak out about.

What I find hilarious about tether is that everyone is afraid they might be running a fractional reserve.
The real hilarious part is that every bank operates like this. It's called leverage, and some have historically run up to 20x of their holdings.
I can understand disliking the crypto industry being run like a bank, that's cool. But leverage is an every day thing in the real world.

Hi Joseph,
Since I know this thread will get lots of attention, I'd like to bring a couple items to your attention.
First of all, despite all the criticism I've thrown your way, I'm still a happy Virtex user. To those of you complaining about fees; Virtex is still one of the cheapest places worldwide to buy bitcoin, even after fees (behind BTC-e, if you can get money into that black hole). Cheers for paving the way by complying with regulations and all that jazz. The MSB license is a huge deal. 
Moving forward, there are at least 2 items that are sores on Virtex's reputation, and they've gone ignored whenever I bring them up. 
**Issue  retroactive inactivity fees**
Here's a tl;dr for those of you wondering what happened;
1. Virtex had a $50/month inactivity fee for dormant accounts but never acted upon it.
2. Virtex warned us they would start acting upon it via their front page news.
3. They **changed their terms of service** to read $50 OR equivalent in bitcoin.
4. Their terms of use still read "last modified in 2011".
5. They decided to act upon the new clause and **retroactively** charged users inactivity fees, without first warning users via email or otherwise. Some users were complaining about huge inactivity fees (like 7 btc or whatever).
Honestly that was just uncalled for.
**Issue  Virtex IPO**
1. Virtex launched an IPO to raise funds for the business, promised a "dividends update" within 6 months.
2. No word after 6 months, edited IPO description and pushed the update another 6 months down the road.
3. Meanwhile the price of shares went to shit.
4. No dividends update, instead the shares were frozen and holders were given the opportunity to buy shares via a convoluted paperwork process in Alberta...
So you raised bitcoin from investors, and from what I can see, totally screwed them. This needs to be addressed.
Like I said, I like Virtex and think you guys are doing a good job, but these things need to be cleared up.
**Issue  ninja edit - audit**
I see from your video that you're doing regular audits. Any plans to make those public? Will you give us proof of reserves since that's where exchanges are headed?
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:44:40
1. Charged inactivity fees retroactively on all inactive accounts after changing their terms of use (ie: 20 BTC inactivity fee to some users a few months ago).
2. Launched an IPO to fund virtex's new ventures, and promised to give updates but never did so and kept pushing the date 6 months down the road until shares weren't worth shit, then decided not to ever release dividends and screwed everyone out of their investment.
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:49:04
No sensible vendor will offer bitcoin refunds.
If bitcoin goes up, ask for a refund, then re-purchase the item for less btc.

Back in 2009-2010 the bitcoin network was run by a few crypto enthusiasts. Bitcoin had no value really, but a few people were involved in mining and had a bunch on their computers.
Then someone might have said "hmm, these could be useful one day, maybe I should grab more". So he/she would have offered to buy, say, 10,000 bitcoins for $10. That would have set the first exchange rate, meaning you could now buy a pizza for 10k BTC. At this point it was all just for fun still, and people sent bitcoin as "payment" for favors, etc. People then realized you could make a bit of money by mining bitcoin, so they allocated a bunch of computing power to mining it, effectively making it hard for people to mine their own. 
So as bitcoin went from $0.01 to $0.02, people started seeing an investment potential, and bought a handful just for fun. This is called the network effect - as more people grabbed bitcoin, it became more useful, and demand increased exponentially, causing the first bubble.

You'll need to explain how bitcoin will fit into the regulatory system.
Make sure to mention that all bitcoin transactions are tracked, which will make accounting, funds tracking and reporting easy (unlike cash).
Explain that MtGox was a bad apple run by crooks.
Don't ever mention mining. If they ask, just say that computers help process transactions and are rewarded for it.
Mention what bitcoin DOESN'T do; this should give you credibility. For example, your aunt wouldn't store her money in bitcoin for paying rent over the next year (bitcoin is an **unreliable** store of value).

I addressed the least moronic part of your post, which is kind of sad but whatever.
You asked "where are the coins" when their location is known (most are in their original address from being mined and have no moved).
In a single run-on sentence you managed to theorize that Russian and Chinese hackers created bitcoin and somehow the fed (?????) has 1 million coins.
Someone with 1 million coins would totally do a market sell order and destroy the currency that is making them rich. Makes sense.

A mining contract is when you rent someone else's mining equipment in exchange for the bitcoins that equipment mines (minus a fee).

Difficulty is adjusted based on how fast blocks are mined.
It goes up if blocks are being generated faster than 10 minutes. It goes down if blocks are being generated in more than 10 minutes. Otherwise it stays constant.
More THash doesn't necessarily mean more $$$ though. More efficient miners are coming out all the time and they don't always eat up more power.

Hmm, ok, not sure how familiar you are with BA but I'll do my best to explain (otherwise go read up on some BA).
When lower bound buy orders aggregates to ~0.9 or more than upper bound sell you approach a cross-over in collision ratios and that's how you know there's a breakout ahead.
Optimal Trade Entry is when the order as outlined above have not yet consolidated into breakout momentum based on % diversion from lower bound channel.
Those are sort of definition-ish, but it helps to know BA.

If the coins weren't stolen, and were indeed "lost" (which is what Kaperles has been saying), then it *has* to be an issue with private keys. What if transaction malleability messed up their private key system, somehow? Or perhaps even, their private key system got messed even *without* malleability.
Kaperles has been hard at work recovering and reconciling addresses &amp; private keys. "We're working on it".
Wishful thinking, anyway.

Some users lost several btc to the change. Totally uncalled for. Virtex's reasoning? "We want to discourage users from storing bitcoin on the exchange".

Centralization itself doesn't necessarily attract consumers, but what it does is provide us with an unbiased system. Centralized entities will do things for their own good, not the consumer's. Paypal is a great example here.
The number one goal of these large corporations is to earn their shareholders money. That's it. There's no passion involved at all. 
Regarding difficulty drop, that is indeed a valid concern. Hopefully by then the network will be large enough that even 5% (or whatever it be) is still too much. The way difficulty is ramping up... we're definitely on that path.

I spent a few hours printing emails, gathering proof and all information related to the transaction that had gone sour.
When I was finally ready, I called up my credit card company, and explained that I had been defrauded of $XX and filing for a chargeback.
No questions followed. The chargeback was filed immediately and I didn't need to present any proof or information at all.

Bad place to ask.... reddit HATES MtGox. Don't get me wrong, there's good reason to be pissed at Gox (many actually), but I don't think MtGox is insolvent or a scam. 
Gox will most likely resume activities soon, including bitcoin withdrawals.
The only way to "buy" at these cheap rates right now is to trade "real bitcoins" for bitcoins that are trapped in MtGox. I'd say there's a 75% chance you'd be ok doing this. See bitcoinbuilder.com.

I was the victim of credit card fraud and there was a deductible on the amount I was reimbursed. It was a small amount, but it still cost me. A month later I was told my credit score dropped due to the theft. That might cost me in the form of higher interest rates.
One of the reasons credit card rates are so damn high is because of credit card theft/fraud. Everyone pays into offsetting theft. When someone does a chargeback, the merchant is held responsible and take the hit. This is a cost to the merchant who may very well be 100% innocent.
The way bitcoin works right now, whoever loses bitcoin takes the loss. In the credit card world this loss is distributed to everyone.
In short; I completely disagree that credit cards cost owners nothing.

As they bust through the steel door leading to his fortress-like office, he'll leap out the window, smashing through glass, only to grab onto a rope dangling from a helicopter.
The helicopter will take authorities through a high-speed aerial chase winding through buildings and skyscrapers, with Kaperles dodging light poles and statues with inhuman feats of agility.

Assuming you're not trolling, I will entertain your request for a gentlemanly debate.
**is** a circlejerk. The polar opposite of this subreddit, is *also* a circlejerk. There are few moderate bitcoin subreddits because the topic is so polarizing.
I consider myself a moderate bitcoiner. I can see the clear advantages of bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies in general), but also the critical downsides that could lead to a slow decline and eventual death.
Charles Ponzi conjured up a scheme where he borrowed $10 from party A, promising a return of $20 by week's end. He then solicited $20 from party B, promising a return of $40 by week end. The $20 was used to pay off party A. If the operator (Charles Ponzi) could not secure the subsequently larger loan, nobody was paid, and the entire scheme collapsed immediately.
Bitcoin will shrink in value (by a fraction of a percent) if no more money is invested. The dollar works like this. Gold works like this. Is gold a ponzi scheme?
You can call it a scheme if you want. People are out there pumping bitcoin all the time. After all, the more money goes into bitcoin, the more their own portfolio is worth. So in that regard, you could call it a scheme, but it's no ponzi scheme.

I'm not familiar with the bitcoin code, but I guarantee you the issue is more complicated than changing X = 7 to X = 70.
If it were that simple I'm sure we wouldn't need to hire so-called professionals to fix it. Not like we'd need professionals to replace the "amateurs" that are currently working on the code, right?
And I should also add; bitcoin doesn't gradually grow until it "makes it". Bitcoin tends to explode in popularity, and scalability needs to be fixed ahead of that. We can't get caught with our pants down.

Here's the thing; not many people have bitcoin, partly because it's hard to find a place to spend it.
The next company to accept bitcoin will bring the currency &gt;&lt; this much closer to being "widely" accepted.
So that 3% might become 4% for a company of Overstock's size. Then 6%, then 15%.

The problems you're encountering are caused entirely by the banking system and the regulation surrounding it.
Bitcoin exchanges are forced to comply to KYC laws meaning they need to do extensive verification on every customer.
Fiat deposits take forever because the banking system is antiquated.
Paypal payments are rarely accepted because paypal is 100% reversible. You paid a huge premium for buying on Virwox. Otherwise the fees are pretty reasonable on most exchanges. 0.5% seems to be the going rate, except for crazy places like cavirtex (1.5%, down from 3% recently).

@_date: 2014-02-21 16:57:59
1. Gox halts all withdrawals due to transaction malleability bug. Meanwhile Bitstamp does the same, but fixes problem and resumes withdrawals within 2 days.
2. Gox supposedly insolvent. Holders of Gox BTC panic and trade their BTC for $$$, hoping that they can claim $$$ in lawsuit should Gox go bankrupt.
3. Depositing $$$ is risky since you may not get your BTC out. You can trade Gox BTC for real BTC at bitcoinbuilder.com

Not a bad write-up but no doubt you will get downvoted hard for critiquing bitcoin, unfortunately that's how it goes in this subreddit.
I guess I'll address some of your points:
1. Yes, google and apple etc are huge corporations with tremendous resources, but whatever they develop will be for their OWN good, ie, it will be centralized. You don't need to be a large corporation to make a good product, you need to be **passionate**. See Firefox. For this reason I don't see any corporation developing a competing system, but rather, a layer on top of paypal or whatever.
2. You are confused about mining. Let's say tomorrow the last bitcoin is mined and miners now work only for fees. 95% of miners go offline, difficulty drops by an equitable amount, and we once again reach equilibrium. The bitcoin network has like 10 million times the processing power needed.
3. The argument that bitcoin needs simplicity and security are absolutely valid.
@_date: 2014-06-24 17:46:00
Problem is, the dividends shrink by ~10% every week. The coins won't retain their value.

Sponsoring Joe Lauzon is somewhere in between. MMA fans are probably a bit younger and more tech savvy, and Joe Rogan has already opened the BTC conversation through his podcast.
Joe Lauzon is awesome and I will get behind this effort, but at the end of the day I'd rather see us target a better audience.

Let's be fair, chargebacks are fucking bullshit.
Put yourself in the shoes of a vendor (say, someone like me).
People use their credit card to pay with things because they know they can screw the vendor with little effort. It happens to me daily. "No chargebacks" is literally one of the best features of bitcoin, or THE best depending who you ask. Was it the right answer for Joseph David? Probably not, but at least he's being honest.
I was screwed by a vendor once. I took a few hours to gather up evidence, print out documents and build a case. I then called my credit card company, told them about the fraudulent charge, and they immediately reversed the transaction without asking any questions. That's how fucked up chargebacks are right now. I didn't have to use any of the evidence I had gathered up.

Absolutely positively agree. It would be an amazing experiment. 
I don't see the bigger MMOs jumping onboard as most like to have control of their in-game currencies (IGC), but smaller games should definitely collaborate to make this a reality.
1. In-game cryptos will make it much easier for people to do $$$ -&gt; IGC. Some games allow the player to obtain awesome gear with money, which is lame. Games will have to be designed with this in mind. WoW is designed in such a manner that you can only buy aesthetic items and improvements with IGC, like haircuts, mounts etc. 
2. It will become super easy to transfer value from one game to another. I haven't decided if I like this or not. 
3. Gamers are notoriously bad at account security (lots of youngsters), so account theft will become a problem. Once an account is stolen, there's no "rolling back" the amount stolen with cryptos.

Hi, I'm from the future and I witnessed bitcoin fail firsthand.
In ~2057 the block reward dropped from 0.0488 BXT/BK to 0.0244 BXT/BK. This was expected, but a series of unexpected events eventually lead to the demise of bitcoin.
First off, the halving cut mining revenue in half. Gen-1 Exahash miners became unprofitable and were turned off. In fact, most non-corporate mining became unprofitable except passive-cybernetic REM. I personally disabled mining on my CyberAssistant 2 (that very night I experienced a dream for the first time in 15 years).
Anyway, days before the halving, Australistan experienced a chain failure in their thorium reactors which supplied 30% of the world's electricity. This caused a massive shortage of power and the resulting surge in price caused 3 of 5 bitcoin megacenters to be taken offline (FED1, FED3 and ASICMINER EAST). The only reason FED2 stayed online is because it takes too long to re-ignite microbial-fungal generators, and they figured a shutdown might cost them more BXT (or so it is thought).
Within 5 days the difficulty had adjusted downward ~1e23 to ~2e22 (an 80% drop). Hours later the FED1 and FED3 megacenters were taken back online despite the shortage in power. It is estimated that the additional stress on the intergrid caused at least 15% of the world to experience complete blackouts. 
Immediately it became clear that this seemingly "unfortunate" series was a carefully calculated plan to set up a majority attack on the network. Having secured a great majority of the hashing power, the US successfully executed a majority attack on the network, corrupting the remaining 4 full nodes still in existence. 
Historians describe the attack as the 2nd most important event in human history, behind the 2nd coming of Jesus Christ as predicted by the Westboro Baptist Church.
Such is the story of how Bitcoin's demise. Such is the story of how Dogecoin became king.

I'm a bit sad that I'm late to the party... but let me offer my point of view as a mining engineer.
Indeed, technological advances usually drive additional production of gold or resource of any kind. I think you're getting ahead of yourself though, tech breakthroughs happen every year and that's why **worldwide gold production has never declined over a significant period of time.**
Forget asteroid mining. Consider that only a fraction of the earth's gold reserves are considered "mineable deposits". The definition of a mineable deposit changes as technology advances.
In the 1700s there was the invention of the first pump. It consisted of a series of hollowed out logs with rag-stuffed chains being pulled by horses. This invention allowed mines to go from 30ft to 100ft underground and access untapped resources. Then came the steam pump which allowed miners to reach new depths.
Then dynamite was invented, allowing miners to free resources from hard rock.
Then sulfuric acid was found to free gold from its host rock. Miners went back to old piles of "waste" and recovered gold from them.
Then huge hydroelectric dams were built in Canada, allowing Jamaica to export Bauxite to Quebec for extracting aluminum from this ore.
Man, I could go on all day about new innovations that allow us to go after more resources. Our current exploration techniques allow us to find deposits 2-3000ft underground, which consists of a tiny portion of the earth's resources. In the big picture, we've yet to scratch the surface. 
Mines are spending 30% of their budget on ventilation. I know of a mine that spends $60 million a year *just on air*. Guess what, battery-powered equipment doesn't require oxygen, and neither does remote-controlled equipment. These are breakthroughs that are happening right now (Kirkland Lake Gold is using strictly battery-powered scoops). Once it's figured out, mines can start going to new depth, and mining yet more resources.
I'm sure you get the point. I don't think we'll be asteroid mining any time soon, considering the pace at which technology is advancing and allowing us to mine resources here on earth.

First of all, $188.97 is your revenue, not profit. It's an important distinction because you get taxes on profits, not revenue (just like any business).
$164.21 is your profit after electricity, but what about your other expenses? Ever wonder why businesses like to apply all sorts of expenses? Expenses reduce your profit, which in turn reduces the amount of taxes you pay.

Yes and no.
For every bad thing about bitcoin, there are 10 good things, but some of the bad is pretty serious. For the record, I'm a 60/40 bitcoiner, meaning I think bitcoin has a 40% chance to fail spectacularly.
I will get downvoted like crazy (just watch), but here's some of the bad about bitcoin:
1. Satoshi, the creator and earliest miner of bitcoin, owns like 10% of all bitcoin. He'd only need to *move* a single coin in order to send the market crashing down (as people would fear him dumping coins). I personally think it's unlikely he will move anything, considering *none* of his coins moved even when he was worth a billion dollars. There are other big players that own a LOT of bitcoin and could inadvertently cause huge damage to it. 
2. The mining payout relative to the market cap shrinks over time. This means that bitcoin needs increasingly large traction in order to work out. Without substantial mining payouts, the network isn't secure, which makes it vulnerable to a 51% attack. Again, unlikely, but it's still a risk. Some will even say it's theoretically impossible, but I disagree.
3. It's irreversible. That's fantastic if you're a vendor (chargebacks and reversals are nasty), but sucks if you're the average user. Once your bitcoins are stolen they cannot be retrieved, **period.**

That's a nice little perk, but could you imagine the fallout of BTC-e "losing" all deposits?
It would be Gox 2.0 but without someone to blame, and without any recourse at all for customers. No lawsuits, no documents proving the funds belonged to you.
The anonymous nature of BTC-e is a double-edged sword. They gain far more by remaining anonymous.

@_date: 2014-05-27 17:40:36
I don't really see anyone answering your question yet. The real point seems to be sailing over everyone's heads.
Just image all the money in bitcoin (currently $7.4 billion) is split into a giant pie with 12 million bitcoins. 
When a block is mined, the pie is re-sliced to add 25 slices and all other slices get slightly smaller. Anyone holding bitcoin is losing a portion of their $$$ holdings.
So yes, the the network absolutely does pay $30 per transaction (depending on the block of course).
The good news? Scalability. The network has enough power to process like 1 bazillion transactions per second. It's just a matter of scaling things up, and we will, when the right time comes. In addition to that, the block reward is constantly shrinking so *relative* rewards are decreasing.
In regards to your concern about mining coming to an end - the process isn't sudden. It's very gradual and miners will have tons of time to react. I see no issue at all.

People always seek to demonstrate inherent value for bitcoin, but to me that's meaningless. Just as meaningless as defining bitcoin as a currency.
I mean, why are we trying to fit bitcoin in this shitty currency category? Bitcoin is a technology, a protocol. It does anything and everything that currencies cannot. We should be agreeing with this guy and say that bitcoin is absolutely NOT a currency.
By definition currency needs a political environment. It needs DEFENSE; if someone invades, they can scrap your currency. I don't think anyone will be invading the internet any time soon.

Let me ask you a question. When was the bitcoin network safer:
* When the market cap was $13 billion (or whatever), with a quarter of today's hash rate.
OR 
* Today.
@_date: 2014-08-18 18:43:55
You're using words a 5 year old would not understand. Here's a translation:
Margin Trading is when you borrow bitcoins/USD and bet against bitcoin going up or down. So you go "long" (this means betting bitcoin will go up) and you've borrowed 2 bitcoin. Bitcoin goes from $100 to $120, you've made $40. You take the profit, and give the bitcoins back + a small fee. If the price were to go down to $80, you've lost $40, and need to pay that back to the lender. 
Say you actually owned 1 bitcoin in the scenario above (non-borrowed). That's 2:1 margin trading (ie: losses are amplified 2x). If you lost $40, you would need to sell part of that bitcoin to pay the lender back.
If bitcoin went from say, $150 to $100, that's a $100 loss (since you borrowed 2 bitcoins and each lost $50), and you'd have to sell your entire bitcoin to pay back the lender. When you're "forced" to sell like that, it's called a "margin call".
So because so many people are going long right now, and the price crashes, they get margin called, are forced to sell their bitcoin, which drives the price lower... creating more margin calls. I'm sure you get it.

1. Nobody has any idea what happened yet. There's this shady leaked document claiming 750k bitcoins were stolen over the course of several years, which seems fucking impossible to me. That's like a bank saying "yeah uh, we had trillions stolen slowly and never noticed". The media is just eating up the speculation and going full sensationalist. Don't fall for it.
2. Probably Japan.
3. Unknown, but Gox has shown some incompetence in the past and people still didn't heed warnings to NOT store bitcoins there.
4. Don't know, pure speculation/bullshit so far.
5. Let's pretend the theft did happen. The thief would have transferred the bitcoins to an address he controls. Once transferred, they CANNOT be taken back. That's the beauty of bitcoin - irreversible payments. In the near future we'll have insured and/or auditable deposits which will make this kind of stuff a thing of the past.
Authorities might get lucky and bust the perpetrators and extract the coins back from them.

3. The standard for digital goods trading will rapidly become bitcoin.

Yup. This doesn't change the fact that you should never store bitcoins anywhere other than a cold wallet.

Most people agree that satoshi wouldn't discard the private keys. He recommended bitcoin as an investment and probably believed in it himself.
The question is; why didn't satoshi sell any coins even when they peaked over $1000?
Some possibilities:
1. He's dead.
2. For ideological purposes, will never move the coins.
3. Expects bitcoin to reach yet new highs (!).
Honestly  is probably most likely. I think it's possible that satoshi would sell some coins, and then destroy the rest.

I sort of have a pet peeve with people calling Gox a Ponzi. Here's a brief description of a Ponzi scheme:
1. An operator solicits loans from people (Gox did not) promising high returns (Gox did not) on an investment after a certain term (Gox did not).
2. Once the period is elapsed, the loan is repaid, plus interest, from a new, larger loan.
3. Continue until no larger loans can be secured. When current loans come to term, no capital is available to repay, and the whole operation collapses.
Call Gox a scam, a scheme, fraud, whatever. But Gox was and is not a Ponzi scheme.

$12b is the market cap because most people believe a bitcoin is worth $1050, otherwise they would be selling.
Now, *some* people believe bitcoin is worth $1050, the rest (the majority) believe it's worth *more*. Once you scoop up all the available coins around $1050, the price is pushed up further. Currently you can buy 4800 coins for $4 million, which pushes the price to $1150.

NMC is considered one of 3 major cryptos. It's nowhere near the size of BTC or LTC, but that doesn't matter. All that matters if that you can turn a % on your money.
MTGOX is also adding NMC. When that happens, there will be a MASSIVE influx of crypto investors with no LTC/NMC holdings. This means a HUGE influx of buyers and very few sellers. Not only that, but LTC and NMC will get more attention.
Both cryptos are still considered cheap per unit, and even though that is meaningless, it attracts buyers.

Literally everywhere! It exists in small quantities in the earth's crust, and even in the ocean.
We just happen to mine it from high-grade deposits. We don't have the energy or means to mine it elsewhere, yet. 
Let's pretend all high-grade deposits are mined out overnight. What happens to the price of gold? Skyrockets - right? Those low grade deposits become profitable, all of the sudden. Old mines re-open, they go deeper, or into previously low-grade areas. Tailings are purchased by entrepreneurial miners are re-processed using newer technology and processes. Old jewelry is melted down to meet supply.
Sound familiar? *That's actually what is happening right now.* Macassa mine in Kirkland Lake, Ontario is going deeper than ever before to increase supply. They have dewatered an entire section of the mine just to rebuild a new shaft. 
Lakeshore Mine in the same city was closed in 1965 only to re-open to pursue now-profitable resources. 
Suddenly, the "resources" in the region are increased. The same is happening all over the world. The price of a resource dictates the effort we put into recovering it.

If you don't want to give me a dollar, you think I'm an idiot, you think this is a scam, that is fine, close the page and please don't think twice about it. If you would like to hear more and why I am asking you to give me a dollar please continue reading, all I ask is that you read through and make up your own mind about it.
Now considering that most people will probably have a ton of questions about the site and why they should give me a dollar I have decided to do a frequently asked questions to basically sum everything up. So below are the questions I figured I would get asked the most and the answers to them.
Why should I give you bitcoin?
Cause you want to. I do not want to try and make anyone give me anything. This pagees main purpose is to ASK people for a bitcoins. If you feel that I don't need your bitcoin or you have something more important to do with it or if you think you need it more then I do that's great, this isn't about anything but what you think, its your decision.
Why do you need a bitcoin?
Now this one is a little more in depth. I know a lot of you reading this have been at the point where you are living paycheck to paycheck. That is where I am now. Let me give you a little more information. I'm 21 years old, i'm married to a wonderful wife who is 20 about to turn 21. We have two kids, my son who turn almost 3 in December and a beautiful daughter who was born in April of 2012. My wife has been pregnant so she has been off work for a while and does only college at this moment, she will also be off work for a while yet to come. I do work part time, because im still at college im working mostly in the night from 23:00 till 07:00 and jumping right back to class. The problem we have is we have both made bad decisions both before we were married and after we were married. Neither one of us have great credit, which is no one fault but our own, I could give you all kinds of reason why it isn't our fault and come up with excuses for everything, but in the end it all boils down to the decisions we made, good or bad. We are now in a position where what I make just doesn't do it anymore. We are in debt and every month we get further and further in debt. We have bills that have to be paid, like rent, electric and groceries. We can always afford to pay these but in order to do that we have to put other things off, such as car insurance, car payments and what not, and that just gets us further and further behind. We are just trying to make a good life for us and our kids, we are willing to make the sacrifices to do this but like a lot of people out there we do need help.
Why are you only asking for a 0.005 bitcoin?
I don't want people to think i'm trying to scam them or take there bitcoin or anything along those lines. A 0.005 BTC does not seem like much to a lot of people but if you have ever been in the situation that we are in you know that EVERY dollar counts.
Why doesn't your wife get a job to help out?
My wife is planning to get a job once things with the baby settle down and she is able to. We will have some drawbacks and it may take her some time to get one. In order for her to get a job we will have to put both of our kids in daycare. With the costs of daycare she will not be able to just take any job. Any job paying minimum wage will not even cover the cost of daycare for two children. Please understand something, my wife and I both have no secondary education, in the families we grew up in it wasn't something that was possible. She has some experience in the child care field and she can find a job, its just going to be a matter of finding one that will not put us further in the whole with the cost of daycare.
What will you spend the bitcoins on?
To begin with not much. Whenever I can get enough to pay a bill that is exactly what I will do with it, pay a bill. This site isn't here for my enjoyment or to make me rich. Its here to help, all the money I get from it will go directly to bills to help me get out of date and get caught up.
How do we know you are going to use it to pay bills?
Honestly, you don't. It will be a give and take situation, I will be honest and I will do what I say. I will keep track of every dollar I get and I will post on the site on a separate page what I have received and what has been paid. I will even start to scan in bills and receipts showing what I have paid with the money. I also plan to put up a thank you page. I will put every persons name and location on the site (first name only) to show who has helped me out.
Why should I give you a bitcoins instead of someone else who needs it?
You shouldn't, if you know someone else who needs a dollar give it to them. I am not saying I am more needy or deserve your bitcoins more then anyone else. If everyone in the world who had a dollar to give gave it to someone who needed it you never know, may just make the world a better place for a lot of individuals.
These are the questions that pop into my head. If you have any other questions just comment, I will response and answer your question and I will also post it on the page so if anyone else has a similar question they can get the answer.

Your analysis is completely flawed because Nakowa hasn't bet 20,000 times. I'd say 7000-8000 is probably closer, with a solid 25% of those bets being miniscule. Another 50% constitute smaller bets (20-100).
I don't do statistical stuff, but I can easily run excel simulations in which case Nakowa can easily come out ahead.
There is no evidence of foul play.

How's volume coming along?
@_date: 2013-03-21 18:57:56
Taking gold as an example, there are between 50 and 150 BILLION tonnes of gold within the earth's crust. That's 12.5 MILLION times the amount we use yearly (actually, we don't use it all, we stash a large portion of it).
When you hear gold "reserves", that is in respect to what we can economically extract, which happens to be a target that moves with technology.
Also consider that several precious metals can be re-used (notably precious metals).
@_date: 2013-11-12 14:38:18
Yes, there will always be a need for miners, but nowhere near the number of miners we have today. The network probably requires like 1 BILLIONTH of what we have now.
The people selling the miners know the unit won't pay for itself. Otherwise they would be mining with the unit themselves. Unless you think these for-profit companies are in it for charity.
95% of miners that have been sold to date haven't paid for themselves. Those that do, were still a steaming-shit investment compared to buying bitcoin instead.

Let's say I wanted to send cash to a relative. With a traditional bank:
1. Drive to the bank.
2. Wait in line.
3. Figure out all the banking info.
4. Have the teller probe and be suspicious.
5. Watch the teller go discuss with his manager, who finally approves the transfer.
6. Wait like 3 fucking days for the money to be wired.
7. Eat $xx fee.
With btc:
1. Pull out my smart phone and send the money, which is transferred instantly.
2. Miniscule fee, no waiting, no bullshit.

Because bank wires are reversible.
I send you money via wire, you send me bitcoin.
I go to my bank afterwards and claim the wire was fraudulent. The bank takes back the money and you're screwed. Fiat wires are reversible, bitcoin is not.
Exchanges can fight this a little with ID, etc. It's ironic, really.

You can send someone $0.00000001 in bitcoins. They are divisible up to 7 digits or something. If needed that can be adjusted further. Lots of people say bitcoin will be THE currency, but I disagree. It will play a big part in our lives, I think, but fiat will still exist. Just like gold and fiat co-exist.
Bitcoin runs 100% on the internet. It was invented by a guy/group on his own time, and the network was kept up by a few laptops for the longest time. There are no volunteers running the bitcoin network. People that contribute their computing power get rewarded in bitcoins, 25 every ~10 minutes. This is called mining, but the analogy is kinda crappy, I think.
Who are you referring to when you say people are paid to maintain bitcoin? The dev team?
I know this doesn't make sense to the bitcoin newcomer. The concept(s) are so outlandish, and so different, they really go against conventional standards and that's why some people can't see how this will work (for example; deflationary vs inflationary). 
Whoever invented bitcoin was a genius with a tremendous ability to think outside the box. It takes a solid 2-3 weeks of educating oneself before truly understanding and appreciating what's been done here.

You won't get a solid forum without a revenue stream. Bitcointalk probably needs *at least* $500/month for hosting.

4. Community manager.
 and 3 is often the same guy.

Quick question for you. Are cheques to Canada allowed? I know it says (US) on your withdrawal FAQ, but wouldn't it be logical for cheques to be sent to Canada?
Also, are euro wires available to Canadian accounts? Or would my euros first be converted to CAD and then sent to me? Thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:15:34


Computers on the bitcoin network are confirming the transaction from the sending address to the receiving address. The process is pretty complicated and involves cryptography, but essentially, if every transaction is verified and confirmed by independent parties, you're 100% sure that it is legitimate. This makes counterfeiting impossible. Just imagine if every single cash transaction was examined carefully. You couldn't counterfeit money and attempt to spend it, because there would be no proof of you receiving that cash at any point. Make sense?

I just know man. Just like I know the sky is blue.
Difficulty is skyrocketing and shows no sign of slowing down. BFL has never delivered anything on time and that won't change with this contract. BFL is running a borderline scam. They promised delivery of their 28nm units by Christmas in a mass email to their subscribers. That won't happen. You should see how they treat their customers in forums, it's shocking.
And of course, why in the world would a for-profit company give up money???
@_date: 2013-11-11 13:38:06
Let's say half of the current bitcoin supply was lost. The price per unit would simply double, and we'd be left with a perfectly functional system.
Further assume that all bitcoins were lost, save 1. We could simply transact in satoshis instead.
If satoshis become too valuable, we can just add more zeros and deal with units that way.
These are extreme examples though. A more realistic scenario is BIG and OLD stashes being lost, such as Satoshi Nakamoto's stash, which is presumed lost by some.

By the way, if I could make another suggestion...
I just noticed you need to buy credits with XBT/LTC before playing. That sucks :(. Wouldn't you want to allow depositors to play with cryptos instead? Otherwise, depositors will withdraw when they're done playing, at risk of losing XBT to a price increase.

The bitcoin bubble has burst 3-4 times already and yet, continues to show strength and growth. The tulip bubble supposedly grew and burst once.
Tulip "investors" bought in because tulips were rising in price. Bitcoin investors are throwing money into something they think/hope will be money 2.0. That's a big deal.

Zero risk? I can't even name you a bank that offers zero-risk USD investments. We're talking BITCOIN here, everything is risky.
mcxnow offers interest on deposits. 25% of the site's fees are paid out to depositors.
Coinlenders is another, but I'm not familiar with how it works.
Kraken pays small interest on BTC loans that they use (or will use) to enable leverage.
Obviously not zero risk, but definitely not scams.

According to Cavirtex, that policy hasn't been enforced until this month.
Second, **Cavirtex changed their policy**. See my post here responding to Cavirtex saying their policy hasn't changed since 2011. Your buddy may have some grounds on which to sue. 
Actually, this is what the T&amp;Cs say today:




This is what it said in January 2013:




**You have edited your Terms and Conditions**, because it was patently unclear that BTC would be withdrawn in lieu of CAD.

I think the disconnect is easier to see.
*"Why spend bitcoins when they'll be worth more tomorrow?"* and *"Spend fiat now because it will be worth more tomorrow"*
Can be flipped right upside down as such:
*"Why accept fiat when it will be worth less tomorrow?"* and *"Accept bitcoin now because it will be worth more tomorrow"*
In other words, I think vendors and merchants will offer great deals in hopes of securing bitcoin. Actually, they already do.

1. Security is a big concern. Bitcoin is new. Exchanges are new. Back in the Wild West days, banks would get robbed and customers would be screwed. We're in the bitcoin wild west right now. Insured wallets are coming.
2. Bitcoin is as anonymous as you want it to be. Anonymous like pre-paid credit cards or cash transactions, OR fully open, even moreso than traditional bank accounts. In a world where some people were paid in bitcoin, you could provide the government with your payment address, and they could see exactly how much you were paid and how much to tax you.
3. Regulation doesn't take away the main features of bitcoin. 
4. Volatility is a current issue only. Once we overcome the S curve and reach a reasonable market cap, stability will increase.

Here's an interesting fact: gold production has never slowed down in any significant time interval (~5 years), which is why I think the gold vs bitcoin supply comparison is stupid. Bitcoin is perfectly deflationary and predictable, while gold is in fact inflationary (so far) and unpredictable.

Here's what I suggest doing: lay out all the facts and make your own educated decision. Here's how I did it:
1. The benefits of bitcoin are revolutionary, once it catches on, it will catch on FAST.
2. I've yet to meet a person that, once properly explained bitcoin, is adverse to the idea. This means I'm not biased.
3. There is a gigantic queue of people still waiting to buy bitcoins (over 9000).
4. Conservatively, bitcoin can probably take 0.1% of the world's market share, that puts it at like $10k/btc.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:24:31
See, the case I'm trying to make is that we don't know for sure that gold supply will dwindle. Historically, it hasn't declined over a significant period, ever! Does it get tougher to mine? Usually, yes, but the *supply itself* keeps increasing, which devalues gold.
That's not the case for bitcoin at all.
Since you seem curious: oil is discovered using aerial techniques that can map out the entire planet's oil reserves (because its liquid state refracts sound waves differently). 99%+ of the world's reserves have been mapped out. The case for "peak oil" is very strong.
"Peak gold" is a complete myth. We haven't mapped out the entire world, not even close! PLUS we have *no fucking idea* what deposits could be contained at depth. A discovery of the magnitude of Oyu Tolgoi, or Grasberg (two gigantic copper deposits) would have profound effects on the price of gold.

Well, first of all, paypal policies are really stupid and outrageous, but that's irrelevant.
Let's say I bought the jalapeno off you. All I need to do is pay with my credit card. Then, once I've received the unit from you, I call my credit card company and say "wtf is this, I have no idea what this transaction is!". 
My credit card company will then instantly reverse the payment and TAKE the money from paypal. Your account will show a negative balance of -£537 and paypal will request that you fulfill that balance, unless it was already in your account.
If you don't believe that it's so simple, well, it is. My wife DID have an illegal transaction on her account, and upon calling the credit card company, was instantly refunded, NO QUESTIONS ASKED. She had all the information laid out in front of her, and didn't need to present any of it.
Oh, also you will be hit with a chargeback settlement fee of up to $25.

If it's an option, use your accounts with them as leverage.
TD Bank gave me a hell of a time last week. They wouldn't let me wire to a CANADIAN exchange.
I said it was MY money, not theirs, but they didn't want to "accept the liability for the transaction". I said I'd accept all liability, but they still wouldn't allow me to send my own money. So I switched gears and asked them to liquidate and close my 2 chequing accounts, my savings account, my 2 credit cards, mortage, and insurance. The manager went back to his office, presumably to make some phone calls, and came back. My wire was approved. 
I can see how this can be a liability overseas, but ffs, this was to another Canadian bank. Don't make the mistake of mentioning bitcoin unless you need to.

If I wanted to pay you $1200 in gold, I could buy 1 ounce, and hand it to you. If gold was $600/ounce, I'd buy 2 ounces and hand those to you. Gold doesn't get "more expensive to use" as it increases in price.

I'll try to put it in simple terms:
Every bitcoin transaction needs to be legit. This means computers must verify that the transaction is legit, and this takes computing power.
Computing power isn't free, so bitcoins are paid out to people that verify transactions, making bitcoin possible.
If you verify 10% of the transactions, you get 10% of the payout.
Naturally, people will want to own as much as possible by increasing their computing power (known as *hash rate*).
This creates a competitive environment where everyone is trying to 1-up the other. To keep inflation in check, bitcoin creation is paced (every ~10 minutes, 25 bitcoins are awarded) AND difficulty increases. Difficulty is the amount of computing power required to verify a transaction (to put it in simple terms).
You *can* mine on a laptop, just not very efficiently. It's only fair that those contributing more computing power get paid more.
@_date: 2013-12-04 12:39:00

Lots of jerk answers here but I'll give you a simple explanation.
Let's say you and your friends sit around a table and each person starts with $5. You KNOW that everyone owns $5, no more, no less. Tom gives Mike $2. Tom now has $3, Mike has $7.
If Mike all of the sudden says "hey, here's $20", you guys would EASILY know that he's counterfeited some money, because everyone knows he's only got $3. 
Bitcoin does this on a gigantic scale, and thousands of computers make sure that each transaction is legitimate. 
It's even more secure than that thanks to cryptography, but that's pretty complicated. Let's just say that there is a $1.5 BILLION reward and nobody has cracked it. A single address would take something like 3 trillion years to crack by every single computer in the world COMBINED.

When the price of bitcoin increases, more people start throwing computing power to get paid by "mining". To keep the supply of bitcoin to 25 each 10 minutes, the network adjust "difficulty", which is a measure of encryption for the network. So as the computing power of the network grows, the share generated by your computer would shrink.
Generally you make a small margin on your equipment. Up until early 2013 you could "mine" bitcoins on your computer and make some profit, but some companies started building gear designed *specifically* to mine bitcoins (called ASICs). The increase in difficulty made it impossible for anyone to profit using normal computers.
You might make a few cents with your computer, over the course of its life, but in the past, people were building farms at home to make supplemental income. Even then, that's not easy.

There are 2 separate issues here:
1. Volatility.
2. Deflationary vs inflationary currency.
On the issue of massive hourly volatility, I'm with you. In the future I imagine (or hope) that bitcoin will be deflationary at a rate similar to that of fiat. This is the scope in which I was making the comparison.
I don't think inflationary is any better or worse than deflationary. Rather, I was merely proving perspective from both sides.
Edit: Not sure why we're talking about bubbles etc, the price is irrelevant.

Non-believers that say bitcoin is a pyramid/ponzi scheme are simply clueless. 
That's like saying your daughter's bake sale is a ponzi scheme. Or pokemon is a ponzi scheme. It just doesn't make any sense whatsoever. Bitcoin has none of the properties of a ponzi scheme at all. It has ONE property of a pyramid scheme; early adopters win big.
Just like stocks, if you happened to go in early, you might just be a rich man. Ever hear stories of people finding stocks in their grandma's will? Same idea. Is the stock market a pyramid scheme? Of course not.

Bitcoin is much more than a currency. It's a payment system, a store of value, a commodity. It's programmable money.
Canada and China (amongst others) have given bitcoin the green light. Bitcoin survived 2 US senate hearings and the outcome of those hearings was hugely positive. The Winklevoss twins, Chamath Palihapitiya (ex facebook executive) is hugely bullish on bitcoin. Bill Gates called it a "technological tour de force".

Someone made an elaborate post about that. 
The trades were actually 0.0000001 or whatever. Some hackers found that Gox could only handle like 21 trades per second, so they HAMMERED the exchange with sell orders and Gox randomly picked 21, most of which were sell orders (or buy) depending where the hackers wanted the market to go. That's one method hackers used to make the market go wonky earlier this year. I'm not entirely convinced that BTC naturally reached $200+.

Next week I find TWO $900 credits to my account (total of $1800) and a random debit of $9.
I email them explaining their mistake, and that I'd like to return the money since it's not mine. I ask if I should leave it in the account for them to take, or if I should deposit it back into my paypal account first.
I get this canned response back, some basic instructions on how to add/remove bank accounts.
The money is still sitting there.

So either bitcoin is a 4+ year old bubble that keeps growing, or it's not a bubble at all.

Anyone defending paypal simply hasn't dealt with them extensively (as I have).
First, ebay takes 10%. They own paypal, who then takes 0.5-3% depending on the sale (most likely 2%).
If you're not denominated in USD, then take another 2% off your conversion rate. 
Then people straight up steal from you using chargebacks. Adding insult to injury, paypal charges a "chargeback settlement fee" of $5 to $20 (from my experience). I'm not joking.

Bitcoins are generated by the bitcoin network every ~10 minutes, 25 at a time (this will halve in 2016, again). The bitcoins are given to people who volunteer their computing power to make the network more secure and to verify transactions. If you supply 10% of the network power, you get 2.5 bitcoins every 10 minutes, on average. What your computer does, specifically, is complicated and involves cryptography and mathematics. Whatever it is, it's working REALLY well, because nobody has managed to crack or circumvent bitcoin's security, despite billions $$ being the reward.
Bitcoin is better than money because it won't be worth less tomorrow due to mass printing (amongst other reasons). 
Nobody oversees bitcoin. There isn't a guy in charge. It's a 100% truly free market. It's open source, meaning EVERYONE can see the nuts and bolts down to the last bit. Bitcoin does have a development team who work to improve the protocol. If and when they make changes, the network in its entirety must agree on the changes, otherwise they won't be introduced to the system.
Technically the upkeep cost of maintaining bitcoin ~~is~~ could be nearly zero. 
Most commodities are in infinite supply or can be produced in infinity. The supply is bitcoin is limited and increases at a known rate. 
This is probably a bubble, but not in standard terms. Bubbles usually burst and never again are the same price levels seen.
Bitcoin saw dollar parity in 2011 and people said that was completely insane. The bubble burst, and climbed to $30, people said that was insane. Bitcoin bubbled to $266 earlier this year, people said bitcoin was dead. Rinse and repeat. This doesn't seem to be going away any time soon.

Charles Ponzi borrowed $10 from a guy and promised to pay back $15 the next week. He then borrowed $15 from another guy, promising to return $20 the following week. He used the $15 to pay back the first guy. Rinse and repeat until you're at a point where no larger investment can be found - scheme collapses.

What about people that bought small amounts of bitcoin as investments? I understand that exchanges shouldn't be used as web wallets, but people do it anyway. 
In addition, since "BTC balances will be coverted to CAD", this means users mighty be robbed of ~0.4xbt at current rates. 4 years from now that means you may have been robbed of FAR MORE than $50.
Finally, as a closing point, I buy all my XBT through Cavirtex and **no email has gone out to users about this**. How convenient it is for Cavirtex not to notify holders of this change.
Seriously, I had high hopes for Cavirtex a year ago. Their infrastructure still hasn't changed, the buying/selling UI is cryptic, navigation is broken/weird and outdated, their fees are absurd, and their payment processing is slow as molasses in January.

Here is the equivalent of that concern, but for gold:

@_date: 2013-08-28 15:56:47
Judging from the question it doesn't seem like you did ANY research into this at all.
Bitcoin mining with computers (GPU/CPU) is pretty much dead. You would need ASIC devices from the various vendors. Then the question becomes less of a "what/how" and more of a "when/if". 


This is another variable that is nearly impossible to predict. Some months difficulty increases by 70%. ASIC mining companies can deploy a huge amount of hasing power within days.

Actually, this is what the T&amp;Cs say today:




This is what it said in January 2013:




**You have edited your Terms and Conditions**, because it was patently unclear that BTC would be withdrawn in lieu of CAD.
Users that created their accounts prior to this change in Terms and Conditions have no agreed to dormant account BTC fees. 
Also note the change in language. If I **use** my Cavirtex account, I should be immune to dormant account fees, as per Terms as seen in January 2013. 


Then what is the problem with holding CAD on virtex? Is a hacker going to steal my CAD?
Edit: I should also add that I appreciate that you guys have not acted upon this (evidently fuzzy) clause.

Vogogo *was* a payee with TD and was then removed. I suspect too many fraudulent claims are going against it.
Vogogo was then re-instated, and apparently removed again.
I'm with you on the credit union. I went to my bank to shut everything down. They asked me why, I told them the local credit union was better in every respect (except maybe that TD has better hours). They offered to give me what the credit union offered, so I took it. No monthly fees, free cheques, etc.
Still though, I'm sick of big banks. I'm going to book an appointment with the credit union right now.

Nonono, I posted about this before, but most people don't realize that Cavirtex changed their TOS.
It used to be "if you don't USE your account, we will charge $50".
They changed that to "if you don't EXECUTE A TRADE, we will charge $50 or equivalent in BTC".
However their site indicates that the terms were last updated back in 2011, which is simply not true.
Cavirtex did not email their users when this change went in effect, nor do they email users to warn of inactivity. 
None of my business really, but if they want to avoid lawsuits down the road, they should really reconsider this practice.

Found instructions in about 12 seconds flat, have never been on that site:
*Verification of the bank account
Due to a few, for the affected persons quite damaging fraud cases, the bank account of market participants which is used for trading on bitcoin.de has to be verified before purchasing bitcoins. For this purpose we are offering an instant verification-transfer which is performed by our partner company SOFORT.
If you encounter any problems during the verification of the bank account with our partner "SOFORT", we can offer an alternative verification procedure which is a bit slower. Please contact the support if you want to use the alternative verification procedure.
After completing this procedure the bank account is verified and bitcoins can be purchased on the marketplace (via bank transfer).
The bank details can be communicated to the seller - apart from that the details are not being transmitted to third parties. Information such as bank details are only made public to the investigating authorities with the occurrence of fraud cases that supposedly emanated from the account of the buyer.
If the bank details have been changed the verification has to be conducted again.
The verification via SEPA transfer can also be conducted for countries that participate in the SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) payment traffic system. This also includes countries that do not use the Euro as a national currency (Bulgaria, Denmark, Poland etc. (EU countries), Switzerland, Norway etc. (Non-EU countries)). Please note that there can be additional fees to the recipient in case that the acquiring account is not being managed in Euro.*

Few misconceptions there. You don't just turn on your computer and print out bitcoins.
Every ~10 minutes, 25 bitcoins are released into the network. They are given to people who contribute their computing power to secure the bitcoin network by verifying and confirming transactions. This is done through a process called cryptography, which most people don't understand (myself included). This takes massive computing power, generally the electricity will cost you more than the fractional bitcoins you receive for your efforts.
If someone directs a boatload of computing power at bitcoin, "difficulty" is adjusted so that bitcoins are generated at the set rate of 25 every ~10 minutes.
Unlike paper money that can be produced infinitely, you just can't print out massive amount of bitcoins. Those "mining" lots of bitcoins have invested millions and have prohibitive operational and technological costs, in addition to huge risk.
By the way, even IF bitcoins were freely given to anyone with a computer, that wouldn't constitute a Ponzi scheme. Whoever is calling Bitcoin a ponzi scheme has no idea what Bitcoin is, or what a ponzi scheme is (likely both).

Cavirtex and Canadianbitcoins are both owned by Havelock, so I assume their verification queues are handled by the same people.

I tried that angle, and the results were good (though the conversation was with a bunch of broke hipsters). It works because you don't come across as a fanatic, though you may be one.
Someone brought up the issue of counterfeiting, and mentioned the 184 trillion bitcoins (or whatever) that were produced.
Instead of launching into a discussion about POW etc, I simply gave the analogy that if someone walked into a bank with 100 trillion dollars in bills, none with serial numbers, they would be laughed at and the cash would be dismissed.
Spark up the conversation, let people figure things out, and correct them when needed. Best way to guide a positive, proper conversation about bitcoin.

Jesus Christ guys, if you disagree with the guy, say so. Don't call him an "idiot" or "brain deficient". Explain why you disagree and call him "mislead" if you want. The article actually does bring up some valid points. That being said, I do disagree on several fronts.
First, the claim that bitcoin is used for crime and drugs. Bitcoin is indeed used for drugs, but that's nothing new at all. Fiat is used to buy drugs all the time. The difference between bitcoin and fiat, is that bitcoin does offer some form of tracking for transactions. It was estimated that 5% of bitcoins in circulation were used for drugs (some claimed even 20%) on Silk Road. When SR was taken down, the market only got stronger. What does that tell you?


The market has already shown that this is false. Hundreds of alt-coins have popped up and 99% have had zero success. A select few have a market cap of less than 1% of bitcoin. Bitcoin has first-mover advantage, and much, much larger adoption. You can't just duplicate the blockchain and have it pick up value.


Large companies are already accepting bitcoin. You know, like Baidu, the Google of china. Recently we saw a mining company pay a contractor in bitcoin. The issue of volatility will be null once a larger market cap is reached. Once volatility becomes a non-issue, companies won't need to convert to USD or GBP.


This point I agreed with most. In its current state, bitcoin offers some challenges, including hacking &amp; wallet loss. However, in the future there will be insured bitcoin wallets etc.


It's only unregulated if there is a need for regulation. In most countries, exchanges don't need to be regulated. You can happily exchange your bitcoins for fiat in most countries. Mtgox is a thing of the past.

You've got some pretty thin skin, man. You worked on the site a whole weekend, didn't see results, and now your motivation has been killed? I'm going to venture to guess that this isn't for you.
I worked on my first site for months before releasing it. You can't just release a very incomplete site and hope that people will take interest, especially when alternatives already exist.

I'd take a bag of sand over a brick of gold.

Contract does not stipulate the exchange on which it must reach $1000. Bitstamp hasn't hit $1k yet, and many would argue MtGox isn't a real indication of value.
There is a typo in the 3rd paragraph that makes the bet unclear, or at least the currency in which it should be paid out.
In addition, since there isn't a penalty for late payment, your friend can wait indefinitely before paying you. In 20 years he'll pay you $1000, and maybe you'll buy a beer with it, or perhaps tip the waiter for a meal.
Lastly, parties have not been defined, so we're not sure who has agreed to said bet.
Yes, I'm boatloads of fun at parties. This is what happens when you're working on contracts for too long. FML.
