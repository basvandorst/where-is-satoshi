Also we can give exclusivity to some specific coins to be used in our service and this can helps to bring more money from people who wants that exclusivity.

I did some research and the closest website/platform one who can have a good infracstructure good for ours its KuCoin and Cryptopia, i believe are more but not so safe and legit that those are. We create an enviroment where people put their coins, exchange them if neccessary to use our service. The money comes from exchange, withdraws, my ideea(the service) and from cryptocoin owners(developers,bosses) who wants to grown their price and made them more reliable/useful.

There is no "giveaway" think if you believe that. I post it in other topics around reddit, i dont need a single penny as charity, i dont need and im not looking for charity. Just put that in your mind. Nobody asking millions for charity.
