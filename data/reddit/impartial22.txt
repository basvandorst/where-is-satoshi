Oh yes they are/were.. they campaigned heavily against it saying it wasn't Bitcoin anymore with a settlement layer. That was the crux of their argument! However there has been a change of heart I see.. now they are 'considering' it if the gigablock network doesn't make the grade. Bunch of hypocrites!

Bitcoin is working quite nicely thank you :)

If you are not interested in Bitcoin, and if its so useless why join a Bitcoin subreddit in the first place? Blockchain technology is extremely useful and is in high demand particularly in the financing and banking sectors

Been using it since 2012 and I have no complaints at all.. very happy.
Its been very useful for me. The fact you here on a bitcoin subreddit trying to take a shot at Bitcoin means you are here to just as a troll.

But its ok guys, Vers' a Libertarian so he can do anything with his body and mind and its all good! Insider trading - good! Market manipulation - good! Miner collusion - good! Commiting crimes - good!
Every single Libertarian on the Btrash team is a either a wanted criminal, ex-con, alledged rapist or murderer or been under investigation for tax evasion or some kind of swindle. Every single one of them now has a BCH mining operation.. So Btrash now is fully centralised and under the control of around 8 very rich, very greedy and very corrupt people

Bullshit, they use false narratives to align and enlist the sheeple like yourself to back them on their cruisade .. a crusade spearheaded by Ver, McAfee, Ayre, Wright, Wu and Yang a crusade for more power and money. Then cross the line themselves and of course the sheeple dont care, they turn a blind eye

Great post, makes a lot of sense.

Even the most indoctrinated wake up sooner or later

Why attack, what is to be gained?

Average BCH block size of late have been just a tiny 40KB
Virtually no one is using BCH
@_date: 2018-03-13 01:46:31
Or perhaps Bcash is used in retaliation for the Bitcoin rebranding campaign being conducted by those very dodgy folks at BCH HQ

LMAO, this is just gold :)

Its not an aol moment but its a step in the right direction, for now this is an Aussie only site but in the near future it will expand out to other countries, its a game changer in progess
@_date: 2018-04-17 01:22:03
Rubbish, its a top site very easy to use.. used it on and off for years never a single issue!
@_date: 2018-04-17 02:26:02
No worries, your site and service is awesome and now with lightning (albeit testing phase) it shows you guys are on the ball and keeping ahead of the pack.  Great stuff!

You said user experience is crap. Wrong, never seen that, never heard it, never experienced it
