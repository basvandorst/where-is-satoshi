Why does it matter? A sell is a sell and acts as downward pressure on price, ceteris paribus. Plus mined coins may not even be hitting the market largely.
I'm trying to quantify for you how irrelevant the reward halving is to price formation, EVEN IF for whatever reason people don't want to believe that it's priced in already.
Is anything unclear on that point?
@_date: 2015-12-15 16:59:38
The size of the national debt it not correlated with the value of USD, that's determined by supply and demand. But yes, if you think a supposedly impending "USD collapse" constitutes a relevant portion of BTC's current value proposition, then consider it diminished. The dollar doesn't need to violently collapse for BTC to make sense. It already has fallen 97% in value over 100years, and will probably continue to do so in the long run, although short to mid term it may actually gain in value, depending on economic conditions moving forward.
@_date: 2015-12-24 16:51:59
No, it does not require that. It just requires that a relevant number of big players be aware. But it doesn't matter either way because the supply of mined coins is far less than existing coins sold on exchanges.
@_date: 2015-12-17 05:02:26
Perhaps 
@_date: 2015-12-24 23:22:40

The 30 day volume of bitcoins mined is 108,000 BTC.
@_date: 2015-12-24 16:48:08
No, it is to assume that at any given point in time we know the future supply of bitcoins mined, making it almost 100% predictable and thus an irrelevant figure for speculation. This seems to be a tough one for bitcoiners to grasp at times.

Ah ok thanks for the clarification. You're saying the consensus protocol rule is currently 1MB blocks, and unless pretty much every node operator agrees to go to 8MB, miners mining with the 1MB node can always create blocks that will have to be accepted by the new 8MB nodes? Am I getting that right or how do you imagine that may play out?

@_date: 2015-06-30 22:09:56
Your comment makes little to no sense.
@_date: 2015-06-19 05:38:57
From what I understand last time the situation was such that ~50% of nodes had switched to a newer version. The newer version was accepting blocks that the older one was rejecting so two blockchains emerged.
As you mentioned none of this was planned and pretty much everyone wanted to get back to one chain which then happened pretty swiftly when miners upgraded their nodes (I'm not exactly sure what else was involved in patching it all together?)
This time we have some miners (&gt;60%, let's just assume this is true and sufficiently verified for argument's sake) who may be willing to switch to a node that accepts 8MB blocks. Let's say it's only those 60% and nobody else, we would once again have 2 chains emerging, and then I would think that one of the two chains will be abandoned and that would probably be the one with less hashing power behind it, no?
What am I missing? What is the parallel you are drawing here between the two events?
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:56:01
Changing the block size to 20MB wouldn't eliminate the need for centralized off-chain transactions either.

@_date: 2015-06-16 21:46:53
I believe Gavin said at one point he'd be OK with 8MB. And supposedly these guys alone represent 55-60% of hashing power. So even under the most conservative assumption that they are the ONLY ones willing to switch to the 8MB version (hint: they're not), that alone should be enough to make everyone else go along accordingly, no?

@_date: 2015-12-24 18:11:57
The participants' perceived likelihood of Bitcoin failing will also be priced in. Yes, future events are discounted, did I say anywhere they weren't?
A future event being discounted, however, doesn't make it "irrelevant". It reduces its impact according to the discount rate.
A humongous expected future event may still have detectable relevance in the here and now.
I would argue that people's expectation that Bitcoin may fail may well be the single largest suppressant on the price. The more it fades, the more the price will increase, the more pronounced it becomes, the more the price will fall, ceteris paribus.
@_date: 2015-06-17 20:11:28

In my opinion, people who think the amount of coins mined is relevant to the Bitcoin price are not well informed. The amount of bitcoins traded everyday is way above the coins mined, plus the rate of coins mined is almost 100% predictable so if at all if would already be long priced in by speculators.
@_date: 2015-06-16 22:51:47
Let's say ~70% of hashing power switches to the 8MB version, wouldn't a significant majority of the remaining 30%, plus exchanges &amp; node operators just go along with it? I think most people just want to be with the majority.

Yes, that's a pretty popular myth, I've written about it in my blog extensively: 
- The Fed and all rules associated with it were created by the U.S. Congress
- Membership is mandatory for national banks by government law
- Ownership of Fed stocks is mandatory for national banks by government law
- The Fed’s Board of Governors is appointed by the President and confirmed by the U.S. Senate
- The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is under majority control by the federally appointed Board of Governors
- The products that the Fed deals in are produced and sold by the Department of the Treasury
- The Fed is protected by the U.S. Government from competition in the products it deals in
- The U.S. Government has, via a succession of different court rulings and laws, made the acceptance of Federal Reserve Notes required as a means to discharge all debts public and private
- The U.S. Government receives around 98% of the Fed’s annual profit
I know there may be cases where the question of rather public or rather private may be difficult to decide, for example an oil company that competes with others in a market environment, yet receives government subsidies, or GSEs such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac before they were completely nationalized, etc.
But I don’t see how the US central bank could pose such a challenge by any stretch of the imagination – can there be any doubt that for all practical purposes the Federal Reserve System is a 100% public institution of the U.S. Government?

You can never be damn sure your speculation holds, that's the point of speculation.

You'd be well advised to read and understand your own sources before misquoting them in the same comment. "annual dividend of 6 percent on paid-in capital stock" is not the same as "6% of the annual profit goes to the stock holders". In fact, the one has nothing to do with the other. I couldn't be any clearer that what I've already written and cited in my post:
"The most recent annual report shows that the Fed made a total profit of $77.3 billion in 2011. Of that a total of $1.5 billion was paid in dividends to member banks while $75.4 was paid to the U.S. Treasury. In other words, the U.S. Government receives around 98% of all Fed profits."
To prove me wrong you'd have to find that same source and show me where I did the math wrong. (You'd need to actually read my post in its entirety though.)

So you see no connection at all between having an entity that can create new money out of nowhere to buy up government debt VS not having said entity? You anticipate no impact on government borrowing under the latter scenario? You think the fact that US government debt embarked upon a bender after the last vestiges of the gold standard were abolished is a mere coincidence?
Please, my friend, make the case to me how under a gold money system the federal government would obtain money to fight an $8 trillion "War on Terror" and spy on people when all gold in the world in the world isn't even worth $7 trillion.

The attacker we're worried about is not a profit seeking entity but rather one that is intent on destroying the Bitcoin network at a huge cost if need be.
With enough confirmations the probability of achieving a double spend after exceeding 50% of the hashing power is **100%** as far as I've read. Sure, it's unlikely for someone to be able to last enough confirmations but it's still a pretty big deal.
It's a risk that cannot and should not be ignored in my opinion.

It provides a mechanism to alert you when the address is changed somehow.
And that is in addition to the fact that if someone got a hold of the database they couldn't actually do anything because it's all hashed and encrypted.

"[I]nspection of a claim by Cook et al. (Environ Res Lett 8:024024, 2013) of 97.1 % consensus, heavily relied upon by Bedford and Cook, shows just 0.3 % endorsement of the standard definition of consensus: that most warming since 1950 is anthropogenic. Agnotology, then, is a two-edged sword since either side in a debate may claim that general ignorance arises from misinformation allegedly circulated by the other. Significant questions about anthropogenic influences on climate remain. Therefore, Legates et al. appropriately asserted that partisan presentations of controversies stifle debate and have no place in education."

Banning peaceful exchange and substituting it with coercion (a.k.a socialism) will render price formation impossible.
Imposing a minimum wage will cause unemployment.
Imposing a maximum rent will lead to housing shortages.
When you subsidize one thing and tax another, you get more of the former and less of the latter.
When a seller drops the price, people who were previously unwilling to buy will buy his product.
When you create more money and force people to accept it and pay taxes with it, this will exert an upwards pressure upon prices.
Etc., etc.
There are so many things that economics can test, to say there are none means that you have not spent a whole lot of time using your brain before succumbing to the urge of typing words into a comment box.

I think what most people mean when they say "climate science should be a non partisan issue" is really "... so long as you can all agree with me that climate change is largely man made, and will lead to catastrophe unless we impose legislation to prevent it."

Inflation refers to the supply side aspect of a currency, not its demand. Loss of purchasing power is a possible *effect* of inflation, but not a necessary one. For example, it is possible that due to lots of demand a currency that is currently increasing in supply gains in purchasing power. Or it could also be that due to an increased supply it gains less in purchasing power than it would have without the increase, but it gains nonetheless.

I'm sorry for getting hella annoyed, but what is it that makes otherwise presumably intelligent people so utterly incapable of taking a tiny little glimpse into the future, attempt to predict future processes, shifts in distributions, etc.?
This goes in particular for people who didn't see bitcoin's rise coming at all: isn't it a little bit too obvious that things have been changing rapidly to be missing that just because things are a certain way now doesn't mean they'll always stay like that?
This would be like looking at the first PC invented and complaining that only very few people own one.
Heck, when the first 50 bitcoins were mined the distribution was certainly very uneven, too ...
Use your brain and attempt to see a little further into the future!! Yes, I know it's not what we're taught in school, but so what, break the cycle, for crying out loud!!!

1. 97% of researchers that warmist John Cook "surveyed" agree that the globe has probably warmed for the past 100-150 years, and agree that SOME of that warming was caused by human activities. If it's not manipulative to infer from this that 97% agree with the thesis of catastrophic man made global warming, then I don't know what is.
2. I get my information from books written by various scientists, most recently The Neglected Sun by Fritz Vahrenholt ( although I've read the German version. Also Bjorn Lomborg ( and Warren Meyer (

This is the bait and switch many alarmists pull. Most climate scientists agree that the globe has warmed over the past 150 or so years. Most climate scientists also agree that SOME of that warming may be man made. That's it.
And then somehow liberal alarmists take that info and blow it up to imply that MOST warming is caused by human activity and that its implications WILL be catastrophic because hockey stick.
That unscientific shit is so tired and debunked at this point that it makes me yawn.

Keep in mind that other fields that we today consider hard and undisputed sciences were once subject to voodoism and nonesense as well.

If the address is spendable the content creator could always pay himself a lot at no detriment.
I think there is value to having a provably unspendable address for reputation purposes because there'd be a natural limit as to how much someone would pay himself to boost his own reputation.

In how you query the bank api vs the blockchain, plus in Bitcoin it's trustless, plus you wouldn't have to implement AND maintain a gazillion different integrations with a gazillion different bank APIs all over the world.
@_date: 2015-05-08 20:37:02
I'm not saying the context is unimportant, I just meant to explain that the advancement in having the third entry is about recording proof of transaction, not context.
@_date: 2015-05-08 18:21:11
Here's loosely how I understand it:
Let's say you have $0 cash. Now you mow the lawn and make $50. In double entry your assets (left side of the balance sheet) side adds $50 cash(entry 1), and $50 in retained earnings on the right side of the balance sheet (entry 2).
But there is no entry proving that the transaction actually happened. If it's cash the dollar bills are the only proof, if it's check/wire you have to look at bank account statements.
Going through the same scenario above but with BTC, you could build an accounting system that does the same things (balance sheet with left/right side), but in addition to that each transaction is cryptographically signed and publicly accessible so you could integrate that information straight into your accounting system. So from what I understand that cryptographic proof would be the third entry.
@_date: 2015-05-07 03:48:58
Thanks man!

Dear "journalist": I assume you are a reasonable man of sufficiently mediocre intellect to possess the capacity to read. So I'll chalk your failure to accurately quote the constitution up to sensationalism, opportunism, and maybe just sheer laziness. The section in question reads as follows


Article 1 Section 8 explains which things the US Congress is **allowed** to do, nowhere does it say "only" Congress can do those things.
Now just by the by, if I was a cunning idiot asshole trying to undermine trust in Bitcoin by referencing a piece of paper some old men wrote over 200 years ago I would have probably employed clause 6 rather than 5:


But even then I'd be facing the unfortunate challenge that Bitcoin is not a "security" or "coin of the United States". (I hope you're aware that Bitcoin can be used globally and is independent of nation states?)
Either way, your cowardly and childish attempt to an attack from authority would fail on both counts.
End of story.

What you may be referring to is merged mining, which basically means the Namecoin nodes will accept a solved block as valid even though it includes a bunch of Bitcoin junk in it. This allows miners to do simultenous proof of work for both Bitcoin and Namecoin at no detriment or extra cost, however the two blockchains are completely separate and independent.
The winning NMC block hash just happens to be in the Bitcoin block as a result of the merged mining activity.

Are you trying to insinuate on me?
@_date: 2016-03-02 22:46:50


Exactly! We ALREADY have centralization amongst miners going on., even with just a 1MB block size limit. The bigger the block size the larger the trend towards centralization.


A miner IS a type of node! But that aside, of course nodes are the issue. The more independent nodes are being run, the more decentralized the system remains and the harder it becomes to compromise. Full nodes are important, whether or not they are mining.


Because you say so? I laid out a logical case as to why an increased block size can incentivize more centralization. You can accept it or rebut it. But you can't just ignore it and expect me to take you serious.


Yes, we are all aware of this.


And it's even easier to not go through a hard fork and increase capacity to give us time to assess the solutions that are in the works, unless of course there's evidence that this path will disastrous (which is remarkably absent still as far as I can tell, in spite of tons of responses to this conversation, in fact the more non-answers I receive the stronger the case for sticking to 1MB becomes).


OK, but that scenario doesn't seem to lead to any substantial problems that we can't overcome in the long run. There's no evidence  as far as I can tell that fees are getting out of control to the point where the network has become so unusable; basically as a beta system Bitcoin is working magnificently right now.


Any evidence that shows that users are leaving the bitcoin network in troughs, that nodes are dropping out, that miners are dropping out, that the backbone is fading, that network security is declining, anything that would prove that waiting this cycle out will have irreparable long term damage.


Possible. But what's your evidence that this is happening to a point where it's causing irreparable long term damage?

Yes, isn't trade volume tantamount to purchase volume? Every executed trade is a purchase and a sale, no? I would assume that the volume of executed trades is a fraction of all market buys/sell orders which would make the 94k even less significant.

That totally depends on the type of bottleneck. If it is due to coding inefficiencies, then adding capacity won't help much. We've had situations where an oversight of one particular scenario led to huge spikes in global traffic, to the point where no reasonable capacity additions would have been a solution, and spending time on software fixes made much more sense.
@_date: 2016-03-03 02:44:36

All you're telling me right now is that you're not particularly well versed on either of the two philosophies, namely Socialism (total state ownership of the means of production, also completely interchangeably used by Marx alongside the synonymous term "Communism") vs Social Democracy (a system where private ownership of means of production is legal and where the state intervenes, takes, and redistributes people's monetary earnings).

Someone told me that in the Lightening Network white paper they show that for each person on the planet to do two transactions it's terabytes in block size a day. So if we want to talk scaling for the big time 2x, 4x, 8x, or whatever - it doesn't matter. The problem remains the same. Correct me if I'm wrong.

I haven't actually seen any posts saying that this is THE break out now and that we're headed to the moon. I think most people got tired of being wrong again and again when it comes to that. In fact most comments I see are along the lines of what you're saying.
And if there is to be a violent reversal it'll only happen after the majority has capitulated and when few expect it.

Yes, it's a concern, but there's no evidence that it's a show stopper as far as I can conclude from the lack of it presented in this entire conversation.

Bingo yes :) Just like gold, bitcoin may in future be used mostly as a store of value and from time to time be used to settle transfers between individuals. But I don't think that it's a given that it'll be the major transactional currency and I don't believe it has to be.

Of course there is! The smaller the block size the easier it is for individuals with little disk space and bandwidth to run full nodes, secure the network, and the harder it will be for governments and corporations to exert control.


Yes, but SegWit and Lightning (and whatever other ideas I'm not aware of are on the table) may be able to facilitate the same number of transactions or more with much less block capacity usage.


You'd need to define what EXACTLY you mean by running out of capacity. Of course full blocks and things slowing down is a risk in that it may encourage people to abandon bitcoin. But there's no evidence that this is happening to a significant degree at this stage (keep in mind Bitcoin is still in beta). In fact as we speak the network hashrate is creeping up to record highs again. Risk is not binary. There are varying degrees of risk.

In bitcoin the blockchain entry IS the final manifestation of payment and it's accessible via ONE unified standard, with banks you ALWAYS rely on a middle man to do the reporting. This is a HUGE difference and improvement in my opinion. Ever heard of embezzlement?? :)
EDIT: Plus, let's say by whatever means you're directly and provably wired into the bank's information system (unlikely), you still have numerous different banks around the globe with different APIs etc., so no unified standard.

What I mean is that those people who drive the price (the market participants) already have all the information about Bitcoin's supply growth rate. So all future developments are priced in.

Countless means a lot, so I don't see why this would be such a terribly wrong thing to say. Also, when a block is confirmed miners automatically start assembling and hashing another block, so I don't see much wrong with that statement either?

Yes, if you want to be completely technical, the train with the new car becomes a new train. But why does any of this matter?
Regarding the second statement, yes there is a countless number of blocks at the blockchain at any one time, and yes as soon as one block gets completed, mining computers start working on assembling the next block in an automated fashion (without manual intervention). So technically speaking, that statement is also not necessarily incorrect as far as I can tell.
@_date: 2015-07-23 06:12:22
Thanks for the explanation! And then from there you'd have two independent chains and the small block nodes would all be storing and referencing a different blockchain than the big block ones?

I'm specifically referring to the March 2013 fork. Mining was pretty centralized in only a few pools. The argument that some people make is that if mining hadn't been so centralized back then it would have been much harder to agree on one chain. The counter argument is that if mining hadn't been so centralized back then, the fork may have never happened to begin with since it would have been less likely to have the exact constellation that led to a significant number of miners still running .7 while another significant number of miners had upgraded to .8 ...

I don't think it's important for merchants to accept Bitcoin though, except for those use cases where Bitcoin's unique characteristics make it superior or even indispensable. (I count myself among the latter.)
IF a merchant wants to do it, then he should do it right IMO

Look at it this way: Bitcoin is up from 1/15th of a cent to $220 :)
@_date: 2015-04-10 04:23:50
I am totally fine with people holding rather than spending their coins. I have argued again and again that for Bitcoin to succeed people must first and foremost desire to hold it, not spend it.
Furthermore I don't even think Bitcoin will necessarily become a major transactional currency, nor does it need to.

If "shit's bringing you down" then that usually indicates that you have more invested in bitcoins than you're willing to lose. In which case you should sell your bitcoins until you only hold an amount that you're comfortable losing.

Many people think merchant adoption is of paramount importance, but I think what you are doing is much more so because once lots of employees are willing accept it, the merchant can accept it without converting into fiat.

Bitcoin derives its value from the fact that people want to hold it. If everyone wanted to spend it rather than hold it, then you would indeed see that fictional downward spiral you tried to conjure up out of nowhere.

The dollar has had a long and sustained devaluation phase against other fiat currencies even though most of them are just as crappy or crappier, so it's not necessarily unreasonable for it to gain in value significantly, especially if we enter another credit crunch and a stock market crash.
Gold and Dollar will probably do extremely well under those scenarios.

Yea, sometimes they make valid points that some bitcoiners don't think about much. For example when Dell announced they are starting to accept bitcoin, lots of bitcoiners thought that'll for sure push the price, but buttcoin actually posted a much needed reality check when they turned that announcement into "Dell becomes world's largest Bitcoin clearing house", alluding to the fact that merchant adoption by itself doesn't mean shit for the bitcoin price. =)

Yes, if you want to play around to see if it helps you could reduce maxconnections to 8 and see if that changes anything.
Also, you could try upping minrelaytxfee to 0.0001 since 0.00005 is less likely to omit spam transactions during a spam attack in my experience at least. Plus it's the recommended number per 1kb anyway as far as I know.

I think the book "The Neglected Sun" you may find really interesting as it is really purely scientific and draws upon ample facts and evidence.
Here's a peer reviewed paper now making the same claims I've read in that book: 
Here's a synopsis of that paper: 
Here's a story about a paper undergoing peer review that also seems to say the sun's impact has been grossly neglected: 
Here's supposedly 123 papers on the same topic, not sure if they're all peer reviewed 
You can say for example that someone like Lord Monckton is just some guy making claims, but if there is an avalanche of very simply verifiable manipulations and lies that he exposes, not even looking at the science, it still gives you an idea how disingenuous the people at the IPCC are about objective research.
Virtually EVERY time they get caught red handed reporting false data it's data that suggests man made catastrophe. You can come to your own conclusions as to whether or not that's a coincidence. I am very comfortable with the ones I've arrived at. (This is of course on top of all the scientific data I've researched. It's not like I grew up a committed climate denier. Heck, I grew up in Europe, where the idea of catastrophic man made global warming REALLY has the status of a religion you cannot possibly ever question, and so I didn't for the longest time.)

I don't know that it really is simply a game of bigger pockets. There may be listings whose ratings are so abysmally low that they'd have no incentive to put any money behind their reputation, nor would anyone on their behalf because of poor service.
Furthermore, what about organizations with a huge following but little funds? Every follower could burn a tiny amount and it would mean something to me that they did. Or one individual could burn a lot and that would also mean something to me. It's not going to determine my entire impression of the organization or the individual but certainly a part of it.

No it's not, and they still don't understand the real reason why there hasn't been hyperinflation: in a freely floating non-convertible fiat money system it's difficult to impossible to bring about hyper inflation, at least monetarily.

You can't rise to the top of the list if your user reviews are bad, not even close. In fact, if you have a crappy rating and burn a ton of coins you'll still have a little less crappy rating, that's all. And I think that's fine with me. I'd still care that someone is vouching for someone's reputation by burning coins ...

I can tell you that 100% of my life works beautifully without aggression. The same applies to virtually everyone around me. The same even applies to the lives of most people who peacefully engage in debates where they tell me about the necessity of limited government. (I assume you yourself are currently typing and didn't obtain your computer via extortion or are making someone type for you at gunpoint.)
Meanwhile said "limited" "representative" governments have "contained power" by unleashing unspeakable terror bombing campaigns upon millions of civilians, put people into internment camps, delivered nuclear armageddon with present and lasting effects, have let loose chemical weapons upon yet another million plus people over the past century.

The market capitalization of any country wide or even global currency is generally far greater than the annual revenue of a particular company within that country or globe.

Profit/loss considerations, incentives, public resistance, trillions of dollars you could make instead of lose by trading voluntarily instead of amassing armies, trillions in future liabilities for veteran care that you'd be personally liable for, a completely tarnished reputation, the lack of an almighty propaganda apparatus to bribe and seek protection from, a highly armed populace.

@_date: 2015-02-16 22:21:47
It doesn't just benefit those with the most to spare. The burn factor is a reputation COMPONENT, it doesn't determine your entire rating. You could be a popular service provider charity with nothing to spare but with thousands of people who each have a satoshi to spare and appreciate what you do. I think that's a helpful statement to make. Again, not that it determines the complete reputation, but it's a relevant factor to at least consider in my opinion.
In the end, who knows, maybe you're right and it's useless in which case nobody will use it and it won't matter. OR maybe people will use it because they do in fact consider it helpful.
I'm curious to see how it shakes out and don't have any answers as of yet, other than that some people have already started using it ...
@_date: 2015-02-18 19:47:49


Yes, that's exactly my point. I'm saying that the stupidest thing to do under that assumption would be to have a government because that's where those violent people will go.


Nor did I ever deny their existence.


Alright, let me act dumb for a second and pretend that the US **government** did not send massive amounts of money and arms to the SLA who would later move on to become ISIS, alongside Lybian rebels (also US **government** funded and armed, surprise surprise), and alongside former Baathist generals and soliders who became available due to the (US **government** initiated) disbandment of the entire Iraqi army and are now amongst the highest ranking ISIS members.
Let me pretend your astonishingly pointless straw man claim that it's not "accurate to say that ISIS was entirely created by external funding" was valid and relevant, then even your own paragraph notes that it was a reaction by people who felt "persecuted by the Shia **regimes**". I repeat ... **regimes**.

We don’t like having to cancel an order. However, due to the nature of bitcoin transactions, our system occasionally needs to prioritize security over order delivery. Unfortunately, there are times when our processes don’t lead to the right decision, and end up cancelling a good customer’s order.
If you think we’ve made a mistake, we sincerely apologize. Here’s what you can do to help prevent future purchases from being cancelled.
Complete the verification steps found here.

Once that’s done, please contact us at support and we will be happy to manually review your account.

Regarding your first paragraph: I was thinking the same thing too. Technically Peter should be calling for a huge gold collapse under that assuption. However, his argument is that the massive exchange value only exists because of tiny bit of utility value that people ascribe to gold as a backup.
So the easiest way to deconstruct his argument is to show that Bitcoin does have utility other than as medium of exchange.

"Peter doesn't make a claim regarding bitcoin's fair value, so he seems be saying that bitcoin is a bubble at any value."
I have found this to be true with almost all Bitcoin skeptics. 
They say with formidable conviction that it's a bubble but are curiously incapable of revealing the rigorous, curious, interested, detailed and hopefully brilliant research that must have lead them to that conclusion.
Usually those who accurately predict asset bubbles have a pretty good level of expertise and curiosity in the field they've been researching and have sound numbers to back up their claims.
The fact that not a single "Bitcoin bubble" proponent so far has made a valid and educated case as far as I can tell (in fact other than Falkvinge I don't think any of them have made any case at all) only serves to show that in order to believe Bitcoin is in a bubble you have to be immensely ignorant about either the economics, or the technology behind it. (Or a mix of both.)
It's almost as though the sum total of these people's argument is "Tsss, this is stupid ..."
And of course that in turn then only serves to strengthen our trust in cryptocurrencies in general, and Bitcoin in particular.

I've never fully understood the 'from' field in a transaction. Sometimes it's one, sometimes it's multiple addresses. Sometimes an address that's in the wallet I sent from shows up sometimes it doesn't.
In the Blockchain wallet for example I can select to send from a specific address or from 'any'. But in my local qt wallet I don't see any such option.
Any context on this would be great for me.

"Coding only increases the number of requests possible by small amount"
How can you even say such a thing without knowing the code of the app in question?? Do you have any idea by how much requests can be literally decimated on high traffic sites if you remove unnecessary gadgets, use proper array handling techniques and file/memcaching elements (caching for even just 1 minute or less) vs not doing those things??
If you have an app that is programmed poorly from a performance perspective, you could literally have the best and biggest friggin round robin load balanced cluster, and it would still be sluggish!

Because you can never be sure that it'll work out this way. When things get turbulent, they also get messy. Exchanges get overwhelmed, orders fail, funds get stuck.

His entire analysis is based upon an important oversight: to say that bitcoin's value solely based on its present transaction volume is to ignore the demand that is based on the desire to simply hold it in the present in anticipation of much wider adoption. Even if it wasn't used in transactions at all, people would still value it for its future potential coupled with its scarcity. Just look at gold's valuation. Is gold in any way even remotely based on its present volume transacted as currency or even its use for jewelry and ornaments? Of course not, come on! :)

(FDIC). He questions what would happen if the Bitcoin network were to crash.

It's the hashing power that your device can provide to solve bitcoin mining related problems. To get an idea what a "high" amount is, maybe it helps to put things into context: Currently all bitcoin miners added together are hashing at about 310000 Gh/s. So an additional 400 Gh/s would change that number to 310400 Gh/s, or by about 0.13%

I don't fully understand your concept yet, but maybe we can hash it out via private messages.

Ya I did that too yesterday. Looks like they already put my suggestion in place, no more auto updates in the bar at the top as far as I can tell =)
