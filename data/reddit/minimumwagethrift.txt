Thank you very much for this and the past one! It's very generous of you and the website.

This would be an incredible way to spread out the news of bitcoin to users that are unfamiliar, but there'd have to be a way to inform them just like the ALS challenge did. It'd be even cooler if there was a certain Bitcoin funded charity that people could further donate to with their extra bits.
Edit: I think BitChallenge or Tip-It-Forwards would be a good name. (:

Oh, okay. Is there any for the Windows Phone? I know it's a new market and doesn't have all the stuff Android has (which was the kind of phone I had for nearly six years).

Thank you very much, but how do I set up a special phrase/word like that? We could set it up so that you just put "I challenge  to the BTChallenge,  and have the "BTChallenge" (or whatever the name of it will be) trigger a certain amount?

That's a relief, how do I set up the 'alias' thing? There's no way I can remember the randomized 32 digit log-in thing. Thanks for the tip, does it register tips instantaneous or are there delays for security/confirmation? (Oh, and how does one accept/send? Is it all done via the changebot/reddit?)
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:41:59
I promise! Are there any crucial suggestions to prevent it?
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:25:47
Oh, okay. I just like to stay on the safe side of things since bitcoin is such a new concept in the modern day. Thanks again.

Thanks for the information regarding the security, that was one of the things I was most concerned about if I ever deposit any money into it. What would you label the small/middle/huge amounts as? Say if I put ten bucks in there for divving up for future tipping, would that be small or middle amount?

Yeah, bitcoin core didn't make any sense to me and looked more like a launcher/loader than what I expected it to. Is Electrum the most secure one? I didn't see it on the recommended list and want to make sure. Plus, is there an app I can use for my phone since I do most of my reddit browsing that way?
Also, is this the right site for bitcoin? 
And thanks for the tip, but I don't have any idea how to use it or pass it on and such. Mind explaining that a bit?
@_date: 2014-11-06 17:50:24
Oh, wait what. I don't have to accept anything, it just does it?
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:10:19
Okay, thanks for all the help. It seems like a lot to get used to, but I look forwards to being able to show my appreciation in the future. :)
(Oh, and don't mind this, just want to test it out.) 18 bit

Oh, that'd be an easy way of doing it. We would have to keep some sort of theme going so people aren't challenging people to do stuff that deviate from the whole goal of the challenge. Something simple and fun.
