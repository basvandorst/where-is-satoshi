What? I just said I will. That's a pretty clear cut answer. I see you're adding nothing to the discussion.. that's disappointing. Ah well.. to each their own.

Um. Ok. Check back in a few weeks on the validity of my 'trolling'.
 
1) Care to wager on your accusation?
2) Not that it's any of your business, but I haven't been a kid for about two decades, and I personally have a small fortune in coins.
I'm sorry you feel that way.. so let's wager (with real BTC) or make a gentleman's bet? Your choice.

It is. Price levels.. not so sure about that. This is still a volatile and bizarre medium. Obviously I would hope that price levels do skyrocket.. but eventually they must even out and stabilize for things to be taken seriously. I'm sure after the announcement there will be renewed interest leading to a rally of sorts.. but long term is anyones guess. Hopefully other mainstream companies follow suit.

Aw man that's nice of you. But really not necessary (although I'll take it). I've been a Bitcoin enthusiast for years.. and this is a dream come true. An organization large as PP working on this in the pipeline for a few months now.. it was bound to leak out. But since it's a matter of a couple of weeks before this goes public, I could not hold it in any longer. Sorry if I stole your thunder PP! 
From a personal POV this is just fantastic news for Bitcoin in general. Mainstream adoption (however you may feel about PP) is what was needed.. and thank God that time has finally arrived.

I'm sorry you feel that way, thats NOT the case my friend. I'm not leaking this for personal profit. I do have a large sum of BTC, yes, but that is not my motivator. Regrets that you feel that way. Check back in a few weeks when the presser is out.

I don't know how/when they will be restructuring their Terms of Service. But I do know that the guys in the Compliance department have been working overtime on this one.

Exactly. Despite being an employee (and please don't accuse me of 'biting that hand that feeds me' as I would never wish PP any harm).. that is how the culture is. Upper management knew that Bitcoin was a threat to it's existence, and started talking about possibilities even before April. I want to say last January or around then when it started getting brought up in meetings. This was inevitable.. and yes there will be some growing pains. But I think in the long run it will be cool (and mutually beneficial for the Bitcoin community to have a mainstream juggernaut like PP in the mix and also to revive PP's image).

Good idea. I can do this. Will have to black out any identifiers and then scrub the image of exif data. I don't have a problem doing this to verify my position. I'll do it.

That's nice of you! But you don't owe me anything. Hold onto your 10mBTC as I'm assuming they will be worth a staggering amount in the coming weeks/months/years.
@_date: 2013-08-03 22:25:49
Correct. The writing was on the wall for a while. I can speak to the fact that in the meetings between the powers that be @ PP, there was some political split of opinion. But ultimately was decided to move things along.
@_date: 2013-08-03 21:22:46
I'm sorry? Not going to happen? Care to wager?
I am *not* a "troll". This is common knowledge amongst those who work @ PP.
Why would I make this up?

Been in the works for awhile now.
