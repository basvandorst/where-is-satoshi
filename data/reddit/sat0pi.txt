You know this exists, right? 
I'm not sure if you can do multiple subreddits though.

Don't worry about the 1 BTC. Just glad I could help. Enjoy! :)

Does anyone know if Silk Road is US-only? I know the article said it was Europeans buying guns on there, but how the hell do they ship guns? Do they not get caught in customs? I take it I couldn't buy drugs on there as I'm in Japan, unless there was a seller in Japan which I highly doubt...

I used  to buy Linden Dollars and then convert those to BTC. Relatively quick turnaround, but there is a monthly limit to how much you can buy.

That is normal. It took about 24 hours for me for it to be processed.

Been playing since yesterday. Loving it so far. I do wish that you could see what cards you folded though.

I don't see any option to use PayPal to buy BTC on there.

Nice. Using the Yii Framework? I love that thing.

Did you make this site?

Bitcoinica seems way better to me... Margin trading, clean interface, quick and easy sign-up... I don't think I'll ever use Mt. Gox again.

Nah, you can just put in bogus information for your Second Life avatar name. You only have to verify a Second Life avatar if you are actually going to withdraw the Linden Dollars to your SL account. To convert to BTC and withdraw to your wallet does not require SL verification.

No problem good sir.

I approve of this.
