I use your app! I love it! One thing I think it could use is some color. Red and green to begin with. Keep up the great work! I'd also love to donate...

Nope, none of them. 
You first claimed to be using Coinbase and cashing out profits once a week. 
Then you claimed to be using someone else's info... On Coinbase? Why? This is literally the last exchange you would use here. 
You claimed to be cashing out and buying gold, but then didn't understand a simple question about capital gains. 
Then you claimed to be cashing out transferring to a wallet. 
You're either full of crap, or incredibly stupid.

You're using your own information.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:46:13
No need, nobody believes you.

Let's not drag this out any longer.

Is that a company policy or a legal issue?

They do say it's the thought that counts. I considered the same general idea of giving crypto to family members, but I ran into this problem. I think there's a right way to be generous with it, and that way is just using it to support your family when you can.

Thanks for the response. A few people I work with are discussing starting a crypto fund, but the legalities are a bit hazy.

I understand what you're trying to do... But I'm not sure how this will come across. After reading them, it sounds more than just a little bragadocious... Also... Giving an IOU as a gift... You're putting these people in the position of literally having to ask you for a gift.  I would find another way to present this.

On Coinbase, it's the price that you saw when you placed the order. Go look at the pending transaction to see the exact price.

What happens after the fork if you have your BTC in an electrum wallet? How do you get your B2x? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:09:08
You're logic is sound. I tell all my friends that continuously say "I should have bought at x".. it doesn't matter, just buy more Bitcoin.

It is but services like Plaid use an API that the bank has to allow.

They were being sarcastic. The next thing they say is it will go up, or it will go down. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 15:16:52
No, it's not.

You source is for individuals, not businesses.

He could potentially claim the loss, lowering his tax liability exposure, dropping him into a lower tax bracket. This could result in a tax savings much larger than the claimed loss. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:34:50
No. I can't give you perfectly done math where I am right now, but let's say you have revenue of 1 million annually, 100K of which is profit. You have 100K in tax exposure. Let's say that you are in the 30% tax bracket, and by decreasing your profit 1K drops you to the 25% bracket. That 1K loss gave you 4K back. Disclaimer: these are just random round numbers but the concept is true.

It's not complicated at all. When reporting your taxes, all your assets are reported in USD. If you exchange an item for another item, no matter what it is, you can assign it value in USD.

I'm sorry for not replying to you more quickly. Anything but a C Corp can be pass through, so yes it would change their marginal tax rate, and their overall exposure. I've worked in commercial finance where it is common practice for companies to take out loans without any specific need because the interest is 100% tax deductible and will affect their overall exposure to taxation. Take a loan for a peice of equipment or a vehicle? Accelerated depreciation.. Net gain. It's common.
