No blocks you say? The word "blocks" is in the name.
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:59:18
Wow. You are right. I still have mine too. Neat.
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:12:26
I just read this whitepaper. There are too many issues that jeopardize immutability at the sacrifice of being more efficient. I'm not sure what will turn out.
What is clear however, is that people are intentionally generating hype over this. I would hope that people read the whitepapers and understand what they are involving themselves with. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:32:33
Amen. Preach it brother!
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:16:14
Holy fuck. They are even changing the API over. What a horrible decision.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:45:31
It honestly doesn't matter how Bitcoin is described in the white paper. People who treat those like some sort of bible are ignorant to how technology actually gets developed and improved upon. Not to mention that if you invent something and tell the public "you have to use it *this* way", and they decide to use it a *different* way, the public isn't wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-12 07:21:04
Yeah. I am ready to buy both outright.
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:31:13
He also compared bitcoin to writing checks. He clearly doesn't understand it. Regardless of whether he understands markets or not, Buffet can't promote crypto since he doesn't see where it is revolutionary.
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:30:07
If the account was bought or seized, then that is against Twitter's ToS. There isn't any proof of that being the case yet, but Twitter should still investigate it regardless.
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:17:18
Lol. I can't believe this even needs to be said. Have an upvote.
@_date: 2018-01-01 08:02:42
It's like these people don't even read the whitepapers that they post. I read the Raiblocks paper, and this whole idea of transaction flooding is really interesting to me. Combining that with a sybil attack is very serious considering no incentive to run full (with history) nodes. I don't think that these people promoting this technology have put much thought into the possible problems. The whitepaper should list more than just of a paragraph of reasoning on this.
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:12:21
The *real* bitcoin cash, but better.
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:31:27
Obvious vote manipulation in this thread is obvious.
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:28:14
Yeah. What the fuck is with exchanges that do this? There are also some exchanges that don't let you withdraw the dust either. I had 1.15 + extra decimal places of BTC, and when I withdrew, it would only let me withdraw four decimal places out.
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:25:56
This is pretty much level conspiracy shit. Get this off the front page please.
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:26:00
Let's just have all the FUD at once why not.
@_date: 2018-01-12 10:20:49
I think it's just incompetence.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:41:20
It doesn't. But for some reason, everyone thinks that their transactions are *more* important than everyone else's. So, the priority market is in effect and working.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:13:40
Well yeah. You have to at least have a brain when doing this.
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:40:27
Instead, just stop using Coinbase. Aren't you all tired of playing their games?
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:44:09
Andreas' response to this argument has also been: oppressed people who are denied a way to take ownership of their money will figure it out. They'll do whatever is necessary to achieve that end. Too many people here are thinking that Bitcoin won't work because of 'x', but they ignore the billions of people around the world who don't have the same privileges that some of us in first world nations are blessed with. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:49:01
That's how I feel. If I cashed out, I could make more on dividends than my job. But what would I do for the rest of my life? I like my job, building cool stuff every day, good coworkers, good  environment. Beats just laying around at home playing video games forever.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:07:50
Wow. What is happening? I'm scared lol
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:51:25
I have to agree. After visiting other countries and watching news, America's are a joke.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:51:58
How do you explain reddit votes when 90% of the community upvotes this post and all the crazy wallstreet explanation ones? We all just can't make up our minds?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:25:52
Security too. Bitcoin is safer because it is less experimental than other coins.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:29:35
You should have bought Ripple instead. Bcrash is going down too.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:54:46
Wow these comments.. lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:00:14
Yeah. Given that there are two posts that have contradictory appeals, if both posts receive 90% upvotes, then you can make the claim that the community is indecisive. For widely viewed posts, you generally see the percentages add up close to 110%-120. Not 170%-180. 
Example: We see a meme post on the front page, and a post that "there are too many memes!" on the front page. Both have surprisingly large percentages of positive votes. So, what exactly does the community want?
There are variables such as people not viewing both posts at the same time, but over large data points you would not see 90% and 90% still.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:01:11
But that is so unlikely to happen with posts on the front page at the same time. That is my point. Your point is plausible, but unlikely to actually play out.
Generally, there is overlap. Just go look at Reddit statisics.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:08:11
No, you're not getting it..
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:36:35
You must be new here.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:15:32
You have to understand people. The name of the game is decentralization. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:57:04
If you are going to use a vanity address, write code yourself or use some open source code.
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:22:03
I did not even mention bitcoin.
Go back to your own sub in No one appreciates these ridiculous assumptions. LN is an opt-in system that no one is forced to use. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:46:02
Damn. You're right. Alright, show's over everyone! Pack it up!
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:35:11
Well, it's okay, but you know what an *even better* plan is? Buying 1000 BTC at single digits. Try that instead.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:41:41
In my opinion, Richard's interview with Ver was the right way to do it. Both of them showed respect to each other. Both of them found some points to agree on.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:55:17
Bet your left ball on it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:52:20
People laughing now; people were laughing 5 years ago and look how far we have come.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:27:18
All bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:04:12
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:15:59
You may have some crypto dividends. Claim them, and sell those to offset the loss.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:34:40
I bought a TorGuard VPN sub.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:57:17
Why did you do that?
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:32:26
This, I have to agree with. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:09:59
And why are you telling me? I did not mention LN. You're just a shill probably.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:56:24
If anything is naive, it is your post.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:52:34
That's kind of intentional right? Value security, safety, don't make too many experimental changes, etc. Sounds like a good idea for store of value.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:28:31
If in the future we need to add more decimal places to Bitcoin, would the meaning of a "satoshi" change to reflect the lowest possible unit?
Additionally, if fees are priced in sat/byte how does the aforementioned affect this? If the value of a satoshi continues to rise, does it then make sense to add decimal places?
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:55:09
So a single person upvotes both then? You're missing my point.
@_date: 2019-03-03 19:21:21
There aren't even 7 billion people using the internet. Population projections top out around 11.2 billion.
@_date: 2019-03-03 19:32:53
I agree. Bisq seems to be a great solution.
@_date: 2019-03-03 19:32:16
Maybe it's better to avoid making a symbol for the satoshi since we can add more decimal places. If that happens, then the "satoshi" represents differing amounts.
@_date: 2019-03-07 23:19:40
Agreed. Those would be Bitcoin and Lightning.
@_date: 2019-04-12 09:05:15
Roommate. BTC was $20 a coin. He didn't have any coins, but I started to research and downloaded the core client. I tried to mine on my crappy GPU which was a failure, so I started to mine on my school computer lab computers. I almost bought coins by wiring money to Gox (thankfully I didn't follow through), but by the time I did buy anything with my own money, the price was around $200, and I had my first (real) job so I had some disposable income. After the decline in 2014, I took about 85% of my savings + life insurance money, and I bought as many coins as possible. Scared my wife, but she never discouraged me over it. I read and studied about bitcoin as much as possible. Used a paper wallet (still do). Held all of my coins up through 20k, sold, bought back. Still holding now. I have enough BTC for life, so any additional BTC I get from forks, trading, or services, I just sell for fiat.
Funny thing, I must have told my roommate that I owned bitcoin way back in the day. We haven't talked for years, and he and I ran into each other last year. His first words to me were, "Don't you have a lot of bitcoin or something?". I was floored because I hadn't told anybody.
@_date: 2019-01-10 02:51:52
Agreed. These are the only rules bitcoin needs.
@_date: 2019-01-06 19:35:07
Wow what an untrue statement. Bitcoin is software and *must* constantly innovate. Go ahead, ask any core developer what would happen if they all decided to stop working on Bitcoin today. Most likely, some other coin or a fork would get developed and people would eventually switch to that thing.
I like Jimmy, but sometimes he is just off. I get his point in the tweet, but the word choice is awful and can be misleading in this case.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:32:15
I wanted to know. If you thing it's meaningless, make your own fucking survey.
