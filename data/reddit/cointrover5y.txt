Not the IP address, the public address which receive the output from the exchanged coin. Again I definitely could be wrong here, but I don't think tor can change tx details, only the IP address where the txs were broadcast. Again I could be wrong. There's gotta be someone smart than me who knows for sure

Yea I think every person I've ever met in crypto has got at least one of these sad stories. But I would say that at least most of us are up all things considered, just because you may have less profit than you could have, doesn't mean you should beat yourself up. No one have ever bought at the bottom, shorted every dip, got back in at the new low, then shorted the next high and got back in at the next low. Except Biff from back to the future lol

I believe that simply converting between coins is easily traceable. Correct me if I'm wrong, but every exchange has tx information about origin and destination addresses that can be deciphered pretty easily. I believe they did that with the ransomware coins and traced them through each conversion amd to each destination right?
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:09:01
Bet. I'll do a lil research on that. Thanks bruthah
@_date: 2017-08-30 17:47:05
Well technically there isn't until you make a tx from the account associated with the pub address. So if u plan on never making a tx with the coin then yea, it doesn't matter, but that defeats the whole purpose. The next tx made from that account will create a new tx trail to the new receiving address. So depending on how bad big brother wants to chase you. Unless the appropriate coin mixing procedure is followed and no third party will sell out your transaction details. And centralized third parties will fold like a napkin if they receive sufficient pressure.

Great suggestion. I think time stamp issues could be a concern for smart contracts. 1 ms difference in time stamping could result in fractions of cents would become a large number for unidirectional payments as the different blockchains evolve and interact.
For the concern the environment, POW algorithms should be considered. Imho best case scenario would be if pow algorithms created a massive demand for renewable energy. I which case btc/pow together could fix the financial system and the energy crisis. That’s noble peace prize status there lol

That's is a good point actually. There's no way a hacker would be be dumb enough to have the over sight to at least try to repackage it, never the less don't put a single coin on it and do everything you can to resolve the situation. Send a photo to trezor, contact customs for an explaination. The whole point of hardware wallets is the comfort that comes with security. This photo screams that exact opposite in my mind. And if they won't fix the problem I'd personally throw it away. It's not worth the risk. IMHO

1. Your name is coindumper

Just an observation 
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:59:59
The concept of value is not unlikely the theoretical concept of a pyramid scheme. If u have something people want u can either say I have something of value or u could say it's a pyramid scheme. Without ppl wanting want u have, it's no longer a"pyramid scheme" but it also has no value
A true pyramid scheme requires increasing investors to pay the early adopters. If this second everyone agreed to stop buying or selling btc and agreed that the value at this moment is what it will remain forever it has value and has no characteristics of a pyramid scheme. U only like to think it's a pyramid scheme because more people invest in an asset with a limited quantity. 
Anything that is limited would fall under your classification of a pyramid scheme. Gold, minerals etc.

1. 50 Euros within the the normal daily oscillation pattern of a highly volatile asset/ currencies like bitcoin during this phase of price discovery. 
2. You're probably in for turbulent times in the short-term, but you're betting on a winner. Imagine how some ppl are feeling after dumping 150k+ € into an actually worthless ICO.
3. You don't lose anything unless you sell.

Thought on absolute vs relative. I know actually impossible to truly know this and varied between illegal activity, but can we consider violence as a covariate into these relationships? Hypothetically considering a buyer/seller exchange of drugs. Do you think the dark net markets has/could reduce the amount of violence associated with the drug trade?
So if one believes that drugs will be bought and sold regardless of the marketplace being online or in a dark alley, and the amount of violence is less using an online marketplace, then doesn't online exchanges  seem seem more moral and logical?

2009-2010 was the fight time to buy. So the next best is now. Price only matters when u buy and then again when u sell, anything imbetween means nothing. So If predict ull be selling in the future? Then pick a price price. Same goes for buying. If u pick a buy price to low u won't get a purshase and on the other end if ur sell price is too high, you will  have to be patient and wait til ur valuated Price is reached. 
Moral of the story, if u don't buy u can't sell and if u can't buy u can't sell. This should comfort u in that there are predictable outcome, but unpredictable timelines.

Well I have a string of growing business, a PhD, and that's not really the point cuz they aren't at all related to crypto. But sincerely If ur portfolio is real, u need to hire a small team of attorneys (I hate em but they are unavailable), you need a financial advisor team, and u need a knowledgabke crypto advisor who understands digital security. This alone would have saved ur 100k.
Additionally I'm sure u know that the market price at any given moment means little unless u are buying or selling. If ur holding, u should know this. Ur money is far from lost, ur liquidity has changed a bit, but value hasn't. Price only matters the day u buy and the day u sell.

The fees are a separate issue. If you plan a lot of transactions this will be onviously more important to others. But regarding the original question, convenient desktop wallet which provides control over your keys. Exodus is one that does offer this and is user friendly. And I don't know what amount of coin you need to secure. $100 in coin deserves security, but the amount you put into securing your coin should, at minimum, scale with the amount u need secured. 
Example: $100 of coin needs x amount of security, where's 100000 in coin need x times 1000 in security measures.

Bruthah, ya didn't have to send me 5, I just want to separate the spam from the real  info. If u r involved in the community u know there is a lot of spam and FUD price value jabber and pump n dumpers. I personally believe btc value is never truely represented in its exchange value at any given moment. I believe that ppl should see that data represents accountability. I'll admit to taking advantageous avenue of private value exchange, but btc represent way more now. In this mentality,  your original account of ur transaction events regarding ur bar tab are impermissible to btc and our community thus is a threat to what any nlockxhain represents. If something was truly done as u described u have an army of support. Food for thought from sum drunk but we want accountability. If u were truly fucked, then let the community fuck them back x100 and I owe u a pitcher or 5. Have a safe flight n again I apologize for the confrontation. My fuse is short these days with ppl ruining the community. I want stable growth proportional to end game value for market stability, this speculation has gone to far and attracted the wrong crowd of ppl.

Come on man. The original post was Busch league at best. We are all sick of this FUD and bs market manipulation

If Morgan Freeman said it the world would believe it lol

Thanks for this info. This is very helpful and I appreciate the wisdom 
@_date: 2017-07-11 14:26:15
Absolutely uzalbert. We are all here because we believe in a better future. Lend the fellow man a hand lift them up and let them see the light ���� sure we can talk value a lot but there's philosophical values that are far more important. Imho
@_date: 2017-07-12 14:42:49
Damn Good points here. No doubt. We all get the association and the point about the ratio of legal/ illegal transactions is certainly valid and logical. Also, I think we are right that when my grandma jumps on the pro-btc side of this argument selling in a bit wouldn't be a bad idea either lol. 
I would like these non believers to separate the simple exchange of value from the criminal activity. Who knows what would've happened with no Silk Road (free Ross), but I don't think illegal activities wouldn't exist, just be operated differently (and maybe even worse). If the knife was invented and only used for stabbing and slashing, the guy that tried to sell the first butter knife probably had some PR issues right lol. I guess I don't know and they probably don't care to try to understand the extensive utilities BTC has to offer. 
Good stuff guys

Googling exodus wallet is a good place to start..
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:46:22
It'd be reallly unfortunate if that actually was someone's real seed. Oops �� 
@_date: 2017-07-12 14:47:24
I believe the internet itself got the same scare tactics thrown at it too right? 
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:39:17
It's any obvious one. Thought the sarcasm was understood. I'll hashtag it as sarcasm Next time. No one has 10gs n does like where to liquidate. Address has 0 balacnce. This is a FUD seller trying to scare the market. Haven't we all had enough FUD for today come on man.
@_date: 2017-07-15 15:16:47
Award �� for this guys buy high sell low mentality . 
Or he's being sarcastic, either way he's funny.

Arbitrage is not an uncommon practice, but it takes careful calculations of all of the cost on every end and a thorough understanding of the exchange's policies and even time between buying at exchange A and selling at exchange B. But the practice isn't impossible but often appears more profitable than the actual results. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 23:42:29
Rule 1. Don't just cover the legal pad with ur address or u r a scum bag. 
Rule 2. Don't pump ur BS agenda. Keep the sign and sign guy the same. BUY BITCOIN! 
I don't even got photoshop and managed this little image. Tear down this wall and buy BTC.
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:27:09
Right. Yawn...

BTFD - buy the f*cking dips. HODL - hold on for dear life. Lol- means laugh out loud. Hahahaa
@_date: 2017-07-12 02:29:35
Definitely keep an eye out for the 50+ btc orders to come back to the buying lane
@_date: 2017-07-15 17:51:10
Well technically about 16 of us could have a million. And you can't have mine lol BTFD and HODL

Don't fall for the hype of potential returns. They're criminals and take advantage of us noobs. No one is kicking my self in the ass and saying I told u so more than my self

Im sorry my bruthah. I'm new to Reddit n drunk. I shouldn't been such a asshole. I apologize
@_date: 2017-07-11 08:18:00
Correct me if I'm wrong here, but I believe exodus doesn't provide you with actual control of your keys. They do have the standard 12 word back up phrase to restore your wallet though in the event it is required. Again I'm not positive, but I'd want the 12 word root seed and the pub-private key pairs well secured.
But yea coinbase has had a rough record for DoS during high volume.
@_date: 2017-07-12 15:09:45
Sorry noob to reddit :/ I'm glad I'm not the only one who's had these thoughts for a while tho

Yup.

Up vote asap. This should be the next marketing campaign. Find a friend help them set up an account and givem a micro payment to show them the light. This person is a true Btc philanthropist. This should be a  viral marketing campaign. To spread the word and get everyone involved. I encourage support from those with the means follow this model. It makes btc spread to those who wouldn't consider it otherwise. A major barrier for ppl is that it's to confusing, but there's nothing confusing about it when I see it in action. Even having a few $worth of btc will spark interest. That's the hurrdle that needs jumped and this could do it
All it takes is a seed to grow a tree ��.

I've read some great comments here so far and you sound like a smart cat. I'm thinking good things will come your way. I'm no pro but I feel like throwing a few of my thoughts out there. 
1. Read up, educate yourself, but aggregate the information you find. Meaning that info from all kinds of different sources should be read and critically considered. Who is saying what, and what is motivating them to say it. There will be haters and over zealous dreamers. Trolls and whales. 
2. This technology can be complicated. Protect your investment. Learn about hot vs cold wallets. Software and hardware wallets. Learn about your keys and how transactions are signed and broadcast onto the network. Your knowledge will become the best measuring stick of value. Don't get overly concerned will the $ exchange rate at any given time. That's not the same thing as value. 
3. Don't fall into the trap of day trading until your ready. Hodl strong and don't panic. Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful. 
You are part of the generation that could help revolutionize currency. I wish you well sir.
--legalize it, decentralize it, and treat others the way you want to be treated--
One love y'all

And prolly don't publish ur illicit activity without a form of encryption on a public forum... 
@_date: 2017-07-15 21:23:09
Clever pic dumbass. Most of us long term HODLers have been doin so since the price was 3 digits, some even 2 digits. Think we r really stressing about the most recent Y2k spam news. 
Best part of the current panic is you getting out. Enjoy the downvote, I'll have another beer �� 
@_date: 2017-07-11 01:05:38
Am I understanding this correctly? Let's say I have 1 BTC stored offline with all keys safely controlled. Next, a split into chain A and chain B occurs. I wait to see how the dust settles. The hypothetical result is chain A retains full value, while chain B drops dramatically. Will I then have the option of reintroducing my 1 BTC to chain A entirely, or will half be allocated to chain A and half to chain B?

Brilliant insight asshole. That's the entire point of posting this. Moron

Wow. Thats just outrageous. Imagine every Media outlet flooding doubt into the dollar because it's the currency of choice of criminals. Or even mention it's undergoing constant inflation. What would it take for a wake up call?
