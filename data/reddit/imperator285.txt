What about your car insurance?

Can u link me to a story explaining this? I've been an infrequent observer of the market since 13, and have not yet heard about the Chinese firms/regulatory stuff
@_date: 2014-12-18 02:13:24
Cold storage?

It seems the best thing to use Slur for, would be corporate info going into the day a publicly traded company releases its quarterly reports. Those reports can oftentimes create big moves in the stock price up or down. And whether it's up or down... If you know which way it will move the day before it gets released, you can make huge profits off of buying options contracts.
So a corporate officer/employee goes on slur to sell the info to a group. So everyone on slur who just bid to get that info has a real edge over the rest of the world, before everyone else learns that the stock is about to gain or lose a lot in price. Even if it's just a few minutes, thats all you need to buy some options and watch as the assclowns on CNBC and Fox business trip over themselves to get the newly leaked info presented as a news story.

What/who is ethereum? Apologies for my ignorance...
@_date: 2014-02-03 23:35:01
That is not what you said.
@_date: 2014-02-03 23:07:27
Whoa whoa whoa, this is some pretty misleading information. I'm sorry to say.
While your explanation can be true at times, usually the reason for low trading volumes is simply low demand. It means there's less people out there trying to get their hands on bitcoins in january and february. 
Therefore (and this part is speculation) it could mean that most of the people interested in investing in bitcoins have already gotten in, and there could be a sell off on the horizon.
Or (also speculation), for reasons entirely unknown, it could be a calm before the storm. There could be a massive buying spike in the near future.
No one knows what the market will do. That's why it's speculative.

Oh now I see
@_date: 2014-12-18 00:30:58
Until everyone sells on Saturday 
@_date: 2014-12-16 23:07:51
Where did you buy? Sorry if it's painful to talk about :/
@_date: 2014-12-20 08:19:20
Wow thanks :)
Yea I was kinda thinking something along those lines, at least for sex workers not tech-savvy enough to "figure out" bitcoins, they could each have their own bitcoin pimp, in a manner of speaking, to help make sure they get paid in a reliable manner.
@_date: 2014-12-22 05:37:21
Wtf... No
@_date: 2014-12-16 23:05:02
Haha, Did you come over from r/ASOIAF?
@_date: 2014-12-18 04:20:52
I guess I'll have to look into it. I have over 4k I'd be willing to invest long term but at this point my primary concern above all else, is all the stories I keep reading about large amounts of bitcoins being hacked.
@_date: 2015-05-07 03:53:18
17 what?
@_date: 2015-05-06 23:51:10
I'm saving all money to leave this fucked up country and move to New Zealand. Civil asset forfeiture being one of the reasons actually.
While I'm very skeptical of bitcoin, and may never actually invest in it, I will use it at least once....to move all my cash from the US to NZ.
@_date: 2017-02-23 07:54:50
I broke the dam.
@_date: 2015-05-07 21:02:59

@_date: 2014-11-26 06:50:40
Lol did u just Changetipping me? That's awesome dude, never happened before, how does this work exactly?
@_date: 2015-05-30 19:26:25
Weather is better
@_date: 2015-05-07 01:44:15
Yes and I'm also aware of the five eyes, but New Zealand is about as good as it gets anywhere in the english speaking world.
@_date: 2015-05-22 03:49:54
Are you guys planning to do this for regular uploaded videos, or just live streaming?
@_date: 2015-05-06 23:48:54
@_date: 2015-01-05 03:27:17
Ok I guess I'm starting to understand, any other helpful info a tech dummy like me might need? 
@_date: 2015-01-01 08:27:07
Yay...thats the range I'm waiting for, to buy into BTC.
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:05:04
How much does the safe deposit set u back?
@_date: 2014-12-17 23:52:18


As soon as hackers stop being evil?
@_date: 2015-01-05 03:01:39
Thats what I'm trying to do.
@_date: 2015-01-05 02:56:10
Ok, so why is Trezor so good?
@_date: 2015-01-05 13:40:31
Thanks, I needed a good laugh this morning.
@_date: 2015-01-13 02:57:40
@_date: 2015-01-01 08:30:57
Just in time for Mexico to get all of its new water parks.
@_date: 2015-01-05 02:55:48
Until a news article pops up..."Massive Trezor Hack -- Untold Amounts of BTC Vanish"
The gist of the story will be something like, oh yea there was this tiny little vulnerability in their software that allowed hackers to steal everything, akin to Luke's destruction of the Death Star.
@_date: 2015-01-05 02:33:53


Please explain? I'm sitting on $5k ready and willing to invest in BTC, if I could just be 100% certain they won't be stolen. 
I'm smart enough to know I need a private wallet, but I hear about people with private wallets getting hacked anyways.
@_date: 2015-02-02 01:18:42
I thought this was going to be the bitcoin ad. 
But that was a car commercial.
@_date: 2016-07-11 06:59:13
Because Pokemon is a video game?
@_date: 2015-02-10 05:37:32
93...44... Are either of those amounts much anyways? 93k would only be about $20m, isn't the market cap for all of bitcoin something like $4b?
