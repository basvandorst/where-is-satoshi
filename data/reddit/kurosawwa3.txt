This is great news, would it work with any site that supports U2F? And do you have plans to make a Ledger that has a button like Yubi?

Ledger hardware wallets are great.

I know they don't want to, but coinbase tracks everything people do, no privacy and people will avoid your app.

It is so important that we see more articles like this, focusing on the technology but explaining in plain English how the major players in this space do what they do.

ELI: How does Bitquick work?

So the seller/buyer wont see each other's personal info?
@_date: 2015-08-10 16:47:09
That's bad, why can't simply take the money and deposit from their account into the sellers?

[Coinkite,]( best uptime.

Right on, it is so easy to have unrecoverable backups. It's great to try to move some of those coins from time to time just to make sure you have all passwords and software update.

Agree, and it also works with multiple signature. You can have multiple ledges have to sign for the same wallet.

Good to know, but how do you do email without a large email provider? Are you running SMTP servers yourself?

I can almost learn french from this. The video was helpful any ways.

Hands down Coinkite multisig
@_date: 2015-03-30 17:13:08
I keep telling people about this, its quite awesome. You should make a client side UI for this!

Coinkite is a very good alternative, it's the best up-time I've seen. They have checkout processing  and they let you forward Bitcoin to Coinapult or Coinbase if you need to automatically exchange to dollars.

I use Coinkite to sweep.
@_date: 2015-03-22 15:37:55
 did it with Coinkite + HW.1

Copay is still very buggy, don't use it.
@_date: 2015-03-17 17:15:23
Would love some!

You will lose all your money messing around this way.
