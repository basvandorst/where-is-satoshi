Cool chart
Altcoins are listed as 'bitcoin competitors', hate to ask an obvious Q if this is obvious, but if pegged sidechains is implemented, couldn't all of these currencies coexist and build on each other? 
ie: one day might Ethereum be a platform with a slightly more approachable language to code with, Bitcoin a little more oldschool, but they're both necessary parts of the ecosystem?

Circle is instant you just gotta use a debit card
I started using my account a few months ago, had a 300 weekly limit, then randomly got upgraded to 3k after a few weeks. I usually never came close to the 300 limit even but its nice to have.

Well done Matt, great graphic on venture capital investment. I wonder how much money will be poured in this year.

Many of the theories listed in this thread may have an indirect effect on the price, but what it comes down to is that more people are buying. That's the beauty of an asset in limited supply - we always know the reason for the change in price.
Coinbase's recent promotion in which they offered $10 in free bitcoins to new college account holders improved awareness, over 20,000 students signed up. That was a great way to appeal to a demographic that will be attracted to bitcoin faster than the older, more risk averse crowd.
I also think some in that older, more risk averse crowd have been turned on to bitcoin. The most important thing is what I_bitcoin cited, the fact that it is not dead yet. No matter how negative someone is about Bitcoin, this fact still holds true. Combined with a ton of positive news, I'm sure any investor with an open mind and a few hours to research could become a believer overnight.

The implications of letting failing banks fail is debatable. Iceland let banks fail in the middle of the financial crisis and they have had an entirely different recovery than the US and Europe, who have seen much of the same things that collapsed in 2007-2009 build back up. 
Financial crimes that I speak of have been uncovered, although I'm sure there are more. I'm talking about the LIBOR rigging, the FOREX manipulation, gold market manipulation, HSBC terrorist money laundering, the whole HFT rigging crimes/debate. There are more unlisted and there will be more uncovered. 
The penalties are fines that equate to slaps on the wrist, even when the crime is funding terrorism. Why would these banks stop if they know the government can't shut them down for fear of harming the economy? The answer is they wouldn't and they haven't.

Hahah. 
Someone did that when I was in a Varrock bank in the Runescape world. A few secs later I saw a passwordy looking text above the guy next to me. Logged out and got into the kids acct, stole everything. Maybe I should have felt bad but he had trimmed armor.

Thats what inflation is. The same amount of money buys you less
@_date: 2014-07-15 21:25:06
No, I didn't make that generalization about institutions. But if the institution that is in charge of our money supply is ineffective then yeah I'd say thats pretty bad.
Yeah I do think inflation sucks. Especially when the stuff that I spend most of my money on that has gotten ridiculously more expensive in the last 5 years isn't counted (gas, rent, food). So CPI is 2% but inflation as it effects me is far more harmful than 2%. Particularly when my salary doesn't increase enough to keep up and I am forced to save less.

It speaks to the Feds ineffectiveness.
As far as complexity goes, the fed can print more money and change interest rates, simple enough I suppose. But the micro and macro economics that explain how those tools effect unemployment and the health of the economy are extremely complicated, highly debated, and not agreed upon. So much so that most don't bother thinking about them.
The people in charge are smart. But are we just supposed to trust that they are smart enough to implement these theories in an effective way when nothing they do is proven to work? Especially when the history shows that their methods often do not work as intended?

How about the Fed's goals at creation that it has not ? It was supposed to provide economic stability. In the 100 years of its existance there has been a depression and regular recessions. 
Not to mention one dollar is worth a fraction of what it was back then. In 2014 one dollar is worth 80% of what it was worth in 2004
@_date: 2014-07-14 17:01:13
So ignoring the fact that before wiki starts listing the 'recessions' in the 19th century it says they have trouble measuring recessions in the 19th century, the fed has had a minimal effect at reducing recessions. (24 to 17 yay). And there was also the Great Depression and Great Recession.
As far as less banks failing, that is highly debatable as a good or bad thing. Looking at things since the mid 2000's, has saving banks resulted in those same TBTF banks taking more risk and breaking more laws because they know they will not be allowed to go under? I guess theres no black and white answer but I look at the rampant financial crime that is present today and it gets me thinking.

Right so if the three biggest expenses in my life: rent, food, and gas, all increase in price consistently over 5-10 years then the price has inflated and I am a victim of high inflation. Inflation is the descriptive term for the general increase in price over periods of time. The price of my same shopping cart at the grocery store cant cost $100 in 2009 and $130 in 2014 and we call it bad luck, thats inflation. 
Some economists argue that because these common expensive items are left out of inflation calculations, inflation is severely understated by as much as 10% per year

Can't shut down Tor? Ha
The Navy developed Tor in a research lab and the DoD and DoS fund a majority of their operations now.
@_date: 2014-07-16 02:12:38
If it consistently rises doesn't that make it a general price increase? Yup
Anyways no I don't like central banks they have been humanities only option for a hundred years, it frustrates me that people take them for granted and act like theres no alternative. All we have for evidence that they are necessary is the central bankers saying 'you'd be screwed without us.' They skew numbers to make themselves appear useful and effective (calculation for inflation has changed a number of times in the past 50 years so it remains low, the unemployment numbers are held artificially low while the participation rate is terrible, etc)
I hope Bitcoin continues to succeed so that it can provide people an alternative option to the central bank money supply monopoly.

Absolutely, that is one of the reasons I was attracted to Bitcoin when I first heard about it. 
If there is a currency crisis it will be a lot easier to go online and buy bitcoins than find someone selling gold coins. Not to mention how much more practical they are to use.

Didn't know about the Kronor but thats what attracted me to Bitcoin in the first place. Then I couldn't stop reading about it and now I should probably call it love

hate to break it to you but one bitcoin is actually only $400 and this fee is worth $0.04. 
if this person was sending 1 BTC, this $0.04 fee would be 0.01% of the transaction. Instead they're sending 3738 BTC and this fee is 0.000003% of the transaction

Sucks that you're out 12k but I think you have no chance at winning here, and I don't think you should. You got scammed, and it's your own fault. Non reversibility is a feature in the Bitcoin system. Don't send Bitcoin to people you don't know.
In your post you're citing cases from 2001 and 2006 that say 'if the bank knew it was fraud and didn't help the customer, it's the banks fault'. I don't think that helps you. TD didn't know it was fraud until you did. 
Also...... Getting rejected for a money transfer license and then continuing to act as a money transmitter..... Bold move......

pretty rough title to this post. Bitcoin protocol and bitcoin currency name problems I think.
I use devices with a little bit of gold in them all day long but I I don't think about the gold. While I've thought about it and I understand why you would, I don't hold any gold bars.

First remember seeing a Facebook friend post about bitcoin in reference to price increases. I think it caught my eye and sent me down the rabbit hole for a few reasons
- I followed the recovery from the 2007/8 crises pretty closely and was pretty skeptical of the solutions that were being implemented
- Had been recently learning about macro economics and the US monetary system. I usually wear my hats with a little tin foil
- Price increases catch the eye of anyone who likes making money
