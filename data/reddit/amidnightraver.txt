Gotta love how hundreds of billions of dollars just poof : )

It's less of a pyramid scheme than most other things. It is a bubble though and Vampire Squid will have its quart of blood sooner rather than later.

I'm thinking Goldman has us over a barrel and will soon start fucking.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:29:36
I also don't get how a million smart people failed to see blockchains can be replaced by graphs that self-validate and are infinitely scalable.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:03:22
Friend has Wirex, works well.

Better not make decisions late at night.

Was aware 2011, even made a wallet I think. Not going to kid myself I would have held through Gox, crash, boring years, alts, BCH, 10k, 15k.
@_date: 2018-09-20 07:18:39
They had 15 000 clients. Do the division. Not exactly mom and pop.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:16:15
Could be, Goldman has been in on it all year.
@_date: 2018-09-20 07:16:29
Yeah, our tens of thousands of e-residents are scrutinized to the maxxx for the millions of dollars they might be moving. At the same 1 bank pretty much erased all the work done in AML during human history.

I can almost guarantee you LHV bank is solid.

EOS has nothing and turns out even that nothing can be hacked by 11-year-olds.
@_date: 2018-09-17 07:12:05
What's with the $5800 figure? Before it got there in October 2017, it had already 5x'd YTD. Or does that count as organic linear growth in crypto?
@_date: 2018-09-15 16:42:19
I regret the 1000 hours I spent staring at charts.
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:45:19
I sometimes like to play with the idea I'd had bought Bitcoin when I first read about it at  I realize though that at the time I didn't have substantial disposable income, I would probably have been Goxxed along the way, even more probably I would have sold in 2013, no way had I waited for 2017 and 11500 or whatever the fuck it's going to cost next year. There are very good reasons why there are so few people with really substantial bitcoin hoards.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:11:21
My friend uses it, no trouble so far.
@_date: 2018-08-25 13:11:16
Involuntary hodlers.

ShitcoinCrash used to spam the pool, that accounts for something probably.

Oh no, the westernmost European country that's poorer than Eastern Europe and its own former colonies said something about bitcoin. Sodl.
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:02:46
Ofc it's gonna crash. Just it might also go to 9100 before that and trigger your margin call.
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:08:39
For the rest of November just hold or if you can, buy more BTC. Peak FUD already passed and failed, bitcoin won't be dethroned.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:34:25
This is not a couples spat. This is rich people making themselves richer. It'll never stop.
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:03:37
Then they'll get more back from buying BTC from the bottom.
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:45:37
No it won't.

Even in stable conditions Elliot waves don't always pan out. And we're in the middle of the greatest BTC FUD market manipulation ever.

We should probably just stop refreshing Reddit : )

Was just shorting XMR &amp; EOS. Reddit's 'new' gives no info why it might be happening : /
@_date: 2017-09-27 07:42:51
They're planning to launch internet payments basically. Understandable it would only happen by 2020 in the land of ActiveX and the fax machine.
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:17:42
When a significant number of hodlers suddenly all want to cash out, they'll find there aren't enough dollars to back the valuation. As with every bubble.

 works well with Bittrex.  is great if you don't mind some CSV.

There was news of the Chinese having an extra month to get out and that the ban won't be total.

They're offering me 0.77 XMR instead of 1 for EUR 250. No thanks.

Self-fulfilling prophecy. Everyone thinks dumbasses will think the company is somehow better now, buying into it to make a quick buck, becoming said dumbasses.

Digitalocean's SSD hosting is kind of expensive, but if you only take it  for a few hours or days it wouldn't matter. Blockchain size is at about 120 GB atm.
