I *think* that the misunderstanding is that you assume that any btc that we hold in an exchange is not being used by the exchange. They dont lend it, they dont withdraw and change into fiat and use for other investment, etc. You assume that since you didnt allow them to use your money, they are just keeping it frozen and available.
On the other side some people suspect that is not the case. They are using the money for profit, and keep only the minimum required to cover the expected withdrawals. Just like banks in most countries have to keep a % of the total deposits (by law), they keep the % they know they will need. 
I'll stop here, maybe I'm reading wrong the situation. Do you think the exchange keeps untouched the tokens you deposited and not offered for trade?

While I dont fully understand the last paragraph (for my simple lack of education), I think it is agreed that holding funds in the exchange is not the best idea, for many reasons.
I am still very sceptic about market manipulation. Whales, media FUD, the "big boys" making a move, etc, it is always conspiracy speculation. Don't you need to own/control a big part of the market in order to effectively move the price at will? This would require collusion between a number of exchanges, who are the big holders/owners of crypto funds. I would assume they are competing and not cooperating.

Wrong continent. This is too good to be true!! The link is not secure, otherwise I would share for fun.

It is an Economy science term. Check the wikipedia definition of "money". According to economists you can consider something is money if it meets a few requirements. One of them is that it serves as a store of value. Quote: retains purchasing power into the future. Sometimes not the full original purchasing power.

Suspicious timing. He sold everything near the ATH.

Of course, it is either "smart enough to sell" or "stepping down and giving the project to the people". I agree with you. There was no altruism in his cashing out and running away with the monwy.

Ok thanks for explaining!

I keep thinking:
PoS /
Asic resistant algorythm
@_date: 2018-06-08 00:53:45
Maybe it is as you say, I dont really know all the pros and cons. If you care to explain I would like to know why it is good. I just find it attractive that some projects insist in asic resistant algos because in a way they are protected from all this. There has been too much fud concerning 51% attacks this week, it is the new fear in vogue. All this new hash power could be used to easily overpower smaller coins.

You know they always say you should only invest in crypto only what you can afford to lose? I think from Robin Hood's side it looks like you are one of the rich and that he can put to good use the sum you can afford to lose.

I never tried to check their legitimacy, so pls nobody think I know anything about their honesty.
Even so I think it is a poor choice for a name.
Also I believe almost everyone investing in crypto can be safely classified in the group of "the rich".
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:34:29
Is nobody a little worried about the name of this exchange? I mean, what was Robin Hood famous for? 
@_date: 2018-02-23 12:04:43
I see your point. Still don't agree with you, but hey, no problem at all!

My mind is blown!! In the third world we make deferred payments with cheques all the time. How do you manage to, say, write a payment 90 days from today? 
@_date: 2018-07-13 18:14:59
Deferred checks have two dates: of issue and of payment. Whenever you write one you spacify the "today" date and the date from which it can be cashed. The bank does not release the funds before that date. All checks are a promise of payment, so there is trust involved: that the person will have money in the bank to back the check, and that the bank will make the transaction. Banks are considered trustworthy (for check payments). Also, it is very common to pay forward with a check received from a customer. This makes checks go back and forth, which can be chaotic, but has some advantages. And it is supposed to multiply the money base availability. I am translating from spanish, pls be kind, not sure about some of the financial terms!!
One fun fact: in our country we pay 1,2% tax for using the bank account. 0.6% when money goes in and 0.6% when it goes out. There are exceptions, like salary accounts. But all commerce pays this 1,2% tax for bank movement of funds!! As you can imagine this pushes as many transactions as possible from the banking system.
