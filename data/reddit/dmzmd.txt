Decentralization is almost always a matter of degree. 7000 people in is already quite a cluster. A local meetup system that lets you avoid major online dealers would locally cluster some communications, but would fuzz up the actual transactions.

Be Careful. If both banks rejecting bitcoin and banks embracing bitcoin lead to the same conclusion, then you might just be locked into a conclusion. (though in this case I agree with your conclusion)
This may be a sign that they want bitcoin to fail and think it is important enough to fight, but then it's also a sign that they think they can hurt it. 
For many people 'legitimate' just means sanctioned by some authority. The stranger and harder it is to pay, the more their alarm bells will go off. This probably does hurt our perceived legitimacy, we need to be aware of that and overcome it in our advocacy.

Yes a bubble can happen, even Yoda said a bubble *will* happen.
But right now, in general, nobody has heard of bitcoin. Or most of those who have think it's a weird internet thing. 
We're not at the internet bubble stage, we're at the [homebrew computer club]( stage. It looks exciting, but only if you're here.

Just fork their client and add not.

This argument could be used for anything, it provides no criteria to determining what has or hasn't been 'agreed to'.
By living here you agree to speak English and worship Jesus.
Of course that's not law, but now we're having a discussion of what the laws are and what makes law legitimate, instead of claiming some implied agreement.

That, right there, is your gambling problem.
This is your justification for setting a 'real' stopping point that only forces your sister to take 'a little bit of debt'.
No. 
Play with no more than 10% of your half of what's left now. Put everything else in conservative investments. 
Invest 5% of your half in therapy. There will be a positive *monetary* return on learning to avoid this behavior.

By your description it seems more that we are forced to leave. This is more clear if the tax rate were 100% or if we agreed to daily stabbings. 
But really this is an unsupported and strange premise: That because people are in some geographic area (and for most people, this applies to the geographic area where they were born) where announcements are made, the subject of those announcements is morally sanctioned. 


You should be able to explain why it is absurd without false claims of agreement.
