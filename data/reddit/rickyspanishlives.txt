I absolutely agree with this. If you aren't watching what's happening your risk is THROUGH THE ROOF because things can change quickly and a mixture of winning/losing positions can all become huge losing positions in a matter of a minute or less - ESPECIALLY with cryptocurrency. The market is INCREDIBLY volatile which is good for both making and losing a lot of money in a short period of time. I have done both :)
I have certainly seen that happen in bit when I was more 'betting' on the market. Picked up some positions, was making some money, walked away from the machine, came back and the shit was down 4%. At that point, especially if its still taking a loss, you are REALLY gambling because if you don't have any real knowledge you don't know when the floor is, if the market is consolidating, etc.
Since then I have built my own bots and come up with my own fundamental rules about when is the best time to enter the market, determining where the market is headed, and coming up with strategies to get the hell out of a position as opposed to riding it over the cliff. 
The biggest problem in the whole equation is the human factor. A bot will follow the rules. A human will ignore the fundamentals and hedge and sit in a position a LOT longer than they should. I've seen that behavior in casinos as well - ride the winnings up and then all the way back down because you think you're about to get a break soon. 
Bots take the emotion out of it - and that's absolutely necessary to actually make money.
