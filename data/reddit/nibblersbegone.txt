If you bought in low (sub $1K) and expect it to continue to rise long term, selling on local peaks isn't the smartest thing to do.  Trying to time the market can make you a ton of money, but if you keep trying you will get left holding the bag.  It's fun with about 10% or less of your holdings, but more than that and you're asking for it.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:09:57
I'm just sitting tight.  Trying to sell and jump back in at an unknown floor is extremely risky.  Buying while the knife is falling is fairly risky.  Waiting for a floor to stabilize might be a short window, so if you have more to invest and believe the technology will longterm succeed, buy the shit out of the dip.

"Normally"...doesn't have any bearing on BTC at the moment.  I'm hoping the floor reaches 10K and then we go back to a sane pace and take over some state currencies without a boom/bust...but hope doesn't do much when everyone is screaming and holding out their money.

There are some fundamental chart patterns you can study such as Fibonacci retracement, which might help you choose a local floor/ceiling when making bids.  I follow a "channel" method where I put bids on a local perceived "floor" or "ceiling".  The safest method is dollar-cost averaging where you buy over a period of time regardless of the market price, but in order to get those fees down to 0 you have to bid and hope the market meets your bid.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:28:28
Right now it might not be a big deal, but you should think about doing GDAX limit orders.  There isn't a fee if you place a bid.  The last 24 hours was like a condensed version of the last month, which is a condensed version of the entire year.  This is a completely bonkers market right now so expect a crash and be continually surprised when it keeps going up.  If you aren't familiar with GDAX, it's linked to your coinbase account and the exchange is owned by Coinbase.  If you're going to trade often, those charges for buying at market price are going to nibble you out of a lot of potential profit.

I think that's fine unless you're talking many thousands of dollars.  Large amounts of money and family/friends don't mix well, and it's repeated a lot in financial forums.  If your friends have self-control and don't bet the farm I think it's fine to share your good fortunes and the technology involved.  When they ask you "should I buy X coin or Y coin" it's best to just leave that up to them so you aren't on the hook.

From a technology viewpoint more splits and altcoins means more experimentation possible, sure.  The problem is this is a live financial market with untold numbers of people's money invested in it.  They bought more than they were willing to lose, and that causes anxiety.  Then you have the day traders and gamblers, who are going to be going crazy today and tomorrow.

Segwit, Lightning Network, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash are all addressing the transaction fee issue, right?  I say about damn time, I used to buy little things like tea and beef jerky with BTC... but not sure how/what's sweeping things under the rug.  Oh do you mean how some people pretend like high transaction fees are worth the inability to spend like cash because it's more secure?  Yeah fuck that.  Evolve or die...and that's what BTC is doing.  Stupid crippling fights between opposing parties have no leash when a central authority isn't there to referee.  That's why I like to call crypto a "Lord of the Flies" market.  Or a mosh-pit-2-peer-network.

So no hedge whatsoever? Brave.  Or do you mean invest the most in bitcoin, then hedge elsewhere?
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:16:45
A lot of people are working on different strategies.  There is a lot of mess involved with decentralization and how protocol updates work, so it might be slower than many people would like.  This is a good reason to invest in altcoins as a hedge, in case bitcoin gets bogged down in one of these civil wars and an altcoin is able to resolve an issue bitcoin is too slow to address. For example, vertcoin specifically deals with the issue of miners and is "ASIC-proof".  Ethereum has plans to switch to a [Proof-of-Stake instead of Proof-of-work]( method last I heard, but it's been awhile since I checked up on their plans.  Segwit should hopefully drop a lot of pressure on the Bitcoin chain which should drop transaction fees.  Lots of other stuff down the line.  These are all just top of the head examples and I might have a couple details wrong.  Once segwit got activated on Litecoin and more recently on BTC, I've lost track of what the "bleeding edge" planned updates/competition are.
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:19:19
You can play that game with a small amount of bitcoins to practice.  I do it all the time, but only with 10% max of my total BTC. Predict the local peak and bottom, and hope you don't mess up and get left in the dust when the bottom hits a lot sooner than you thought then recovers past your sell point.  That's why you don't bet everything and you don't put bids in all on one price.  You can recover from bad bets, but not when you swing for a home run every time.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:00:47
Yeah it's a mess. I wouldn't have known about the cancellation of segwit2x fork if it weren't for twitter squawking a few days ago.
 
spreading 10% here and there on some hunches sounds like what I do too.  Most of my gambling money is just about 10-20% at max.  Everything else just sit on as a big bet on the technology itself.  
I've been able to stay out of the tribal warfare surrounding some of these forks, but made some bad moves during the ETH/ETC fork that taught me not to get too emotionally involved in one party or another.  The one coin I've held onto with minimal drama is LTC and it's done quite well.

Each exchange is like a separate market so they aren't synched to anything automatically. They even out over time and fluctuate like many other markets, it can be quite a few things.  Arbitrage is how people skim profit off evening out the exchanges.  If they start varying wildly it could be a sign of market chaos (big movements) or something is locked up on one of the exchanges (lock down of withdrawal to fiat will cause panic and exchange price will swing wildly on that particular exchange).  
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:30:07
You need to stop taking bids and start making bids. Then there isn't a fee.  If you buy current market value with coinbase you are taking someone else's bid and get a fee for it.  If you use GDAX (Coinbase's exchange) and put a limit buy order and place it somewhere below current market value, you are making a bid on their books that someone else will take, so they get the fee and you don't.
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:15:53
 I use GDAX and make limit buys/sells.  No fees, unless you are just buying at current market value.  There isn't a reason to buy or sell at current market value unless you are panicking about something and willing to accept the fees.

I don't think I saw a bitcoin option when I purchased something about a month ago.  I thought it was funny since that was a bitcoin print as well.  I was really disappointed when massdrop.com stopped accepting bitcoin, but now it seems like a good thing since I stopped spending all my BTC.  I'm hoping LTC or some future evolution will be the clear point of sale layer?
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:01:04
I think bitcoin is definitely the safest bet currently, with maybe Ethereum as a solid second.  My "dark horse" investment was LTC, and it has skyrocketed since I got it at ~$4, but I worry about competition with BCH, so keeping a close eye on that and might shuffle around the proportions as things change.  The other coin I've looked into but haven't invested yet is Vertcoin.  The general understanding is if you have your investments spread across a few different options within an industry, you are covered from any extreme losses if one of those investments goes south, but the industry itself thrives.  I've been lucky that all 3 investments have produced relatively extreme profit this year, but next year is anyone's guess.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:13:12
They cancelled the ~Nov.15 fork a couple days ago (due to lack of consensus, and some real issues with how the fork was going to play out).  This is the "Bitcoin Cash" forked altcoin from August (Ver, Jihan, crowd).  If you had BTC in coinbase account during the fork they will give you the same amount of BCH sometime in January, supposedly.  It was an interesting choice: Take all your BTC out and hold a private wallet so you can have both BTC and BCH yourself, or keep your BTC in Coinbase and they may or may not give you your equivalent BCH sometime in January.  Here's some background: 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:16:37
Thats why I invest a large portion into altcoins. btc is maneuvering to be a base layer of a financial ecosystem, but not the "one-coin-fits-all-use-cases" like originally designed. I used to buy lots of stuff with BTC, but hoping now LTC or maybe even BCH can fill the payment and small transaction layer.  There is a huge difference between what people might consider the optimal potential and the situation that comes about organically. The main BTC branch made a choice to become a secure base layer instead of a payment layer. Invest in it at the proportion you believe that was a profitable and good choice. My current hope is LTC will fill the small payment void.

I wouldn't bet on the overnight part, but it does sound interesting.  If China owns a ton of the USA debt and are linked at the hip to the USA financially, could they do some sort of petro-dollar coup without tanking themselves?  Also, the Chinese are normally fairly subtle-but-persistent about stuff, a surprise new dollar-killing currency doesn't sound like their MO.  A sudden new petro-currency would need a lot of time in my mind to spread around the market.
I heard whispers of a digital currency/exchange backed or firmly in the grip of the Chinese Government.  The framework would be part of the new communist leadership coming up.  If something unexpected happens during this shuffle of the guard, the government is worried it will cause panic on markets and people will flee CNY at the uncertainty.  The reason this is noted is the timing of closing down the exchanges matches this supposed fear of flight from CNY.
The problem is you can't trust much info and a great percentage of information is contrary to the other information you're getting, both of which are supposedly credible sources.  
Short version: I call your buddies' info hyperbolic but potentially half-true.  Closest I've heard similar was some form of Chinese government backed currency or exchange system, possibly separate from domestic fiat.

You can buy any amount of BTC you want (some exchanges have minimums, but in general I buy in chunks of $50, which has lately been around .0125BTC).  In hindsight, the word "coin" is confusing.

I personally don't trust myself with hardware and don't like storing anything in a safety deposit box.  So I have various different accounts with different levels of vault/multisig safeguards.

I've seen that spirit in altcoins.  I'm lurking around the litecoin subreddit a lot more than bitcoin due to that.  I think it's that "startup" excitement.  When it gets fleshed out and big money gets involved, the magic evaporates.
I setup my work to accept BTC over 3 years ago, and the community was a lot more interested in the spread of BTC being *used* instead of gambled on as an investment.  That's where most of my BTC went...buying tea and shoes, drapes and video games.  That's what it was for back then, or so I thought.  Coulda been a millionaire but whatever.  
Now I'm onboard with Litecoin and they're where BTC was at during the "golden times".

This is a new reddit account so I'll probably get blocked, but I've been hanging out since 2012 and this is very exciting times for both BTC and alts.
Bigger risk than a hack is really stagnation or slow devaluation, altcoin(s) providing evolution of blockchain functionality.  Essentially we are already seeing the in-fighting slowing innovation making investors hedge on alt coins, and alts are implementing functionality while BTC is hanging itself.  Invest in the cryptocurrency ecosystem, not just BTC...the industry is rocketing right now, but competition is gaining more ground than BTC and it will continue until BTC can get its head out of its ass.

Listen, you need to consider that money a loss for now and just hold it as long as it takes until the market comes back.  This is hopefully a correction because the price was inflated by new money from countries like Japan (which recently legalized it.  Most active exchanges were trading in Japanese Yen).  You got in at the top end of a bubble.  No one knows how far it will drop, but considering the value of BTC has exploded over the last few months, it could be a long drop.  No worries, it should come back and start generating you profit at some point.... just don't panic sell at a loss. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:03:19
I'm ok with "sin-tax", or taxes on substances that are known to cause health issues.  Nothing dramatic, just a couple percent to help offset the burden it shows later in healthcare costs.  I know that can open a slippery-slope into choosing what people eat, but only if you stretch it toward hyperbole.  There's an inherent cost in substances that have bad effects on our bodies.  That cost shouldn't be ignored in the name of profit while healthcare foots the bill.

Judging by this thread, BTC will continue to complain about LTC being a pump and dump ponzi, just like people said about BTC, and hold on to their precious BTC like fiat while it sputters in shock at some actual competition.  The fact that people don't even entertain the notion that hedging with alts is less risky than keeping 100% in BTC is a good sign they really are investing with their emotions and not making any plan B or C.  Ostrich head, meet sand. 
Nobody has a crystal ball to see how LTC will end up, but I hedged LTC at $4 and that hedge has already paid me back many times over, just shedding a little off the top.  BTC maximalists can talk all they'd like about what they *think* will happen, but they need to hedge if they're serious about safety of their investment in any way.

If the miners go by the gameplan they used with litecoin, we'll see a lot of fucking around tweeting things that don't make sense, large mining pools join together and hold segwit hostage until someone goes and visits them in China, then some sort of wishy-washy "deal" and they all signal segwit barely enough to pass the activation window.  The entire time, large swings in the market as they position themselves.  On litecoin, by the time they finally agreed to signal segwit, it was the real threat of UASF that got them to stop messing around, imo.  People were firing up their old GPU mining software at an obvious loss just to show enough hash power to get the miners to budge.
