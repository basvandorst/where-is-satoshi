But if they are forked off of Bitcoin their actually inflating Bitcoin, right? Because everyone who holds Bitcoin gets free coins. Thats like printing USD out of USD and calling them USD XYZ. I think these forks are highly poisonous for a coin thats value proposition depends on being deflationary, right?
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:31:41
Yeah, Im just voting for a market with equal and fair chances for every asset. And maybe were getting there if Bitcoin loses a bit of its volatility and just hangs around. This is IF it wants to be the currency every other coin is demoninated in.
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:10:55
Guys, Bitcoin is actually doing well in what it is supposed to be: Not mooning and being relatively stable, so functioning as a de facto currency for the market. You wanted a currency, you got one. But will you hold even if it stays around 15k?
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:22:05
Its neither a good store of value. Who wants to keep his/her value in something that could be worth 0.1x in a few years? What is it then? In my understanding Bitcoin was meant to be a currency. But, man, I cant even buy some 50 USD of it and send it to my wallet, because, you know...
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:35:01
It could. Its up to the market. Market history is nothing you could deductivly predict into the future. 
For example:


What if all those people giving as early/earlier adopters their Money for a bargain realize their BTC actually cannot be moved? It COULD cause a problem and Im worried about it. I tried to convince people that its a store of value and everybody should just hodl so it plays out well. But they kept on asking critical questions I had no answer to, for example: What happens if there will be a critical point where interest to sell is larger than interest to buy? Would all the people hodl their value anyway? Or will they sell creating a vicious circle?
@_date: 2017-12-29 12:14:51
Okay, so its a draw: Bitcoin is a digital currency and PayPal is used for online transactions, okay? But you cant be serious that Bitcoin is actually used for online transactions. Okay, maybe for some, Id give you that.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:19:57


Which can only be inflated by endless forks. I wonder why the FED isnt up to that, yet. USD Gold, USD Store of Value, USD Diamond, USD God, USD Trump... man, they could have avoided printing new USD at all, because, obviously, this wouldnt be USD then. Its genious. A fool this guy didnt recognize it back then. He would have HODLED!
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:16:05
Such a fool! He actually believed it would be a currency. :D

Dividends for what? Dividends are shares in profits by a public company. There is an economic success attached to them. These are not dividends but copies. Actually they ARE copies of the blockchain history with some changes to them. They share a common history so they actually ARE a part of Bitcoin, if you like it or not.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:24:36
Yes, and it can change its function in the future, when it will actually not hodl up to the promise of digital gold. But we have to think about that now. Maybe it could be a currency when it ends being a store of value, because something that loses value is better be spend? And then rinse and repeat. I guess thats what the endless Bitcoin cycle will be and its not bad if you think about it. We could get to the moon again and again. Then buy fancy stuff and then moon again.
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:25:46
Would you have done better if you should answer a question and got 4 wrong answers to chose from? PayPal comes closest, because it is actually used for online transactions.
@_date: 2018-05-26 07:15:57
As soon as actual gold can get copied (=forked) I will sell my whole stack.
@_date: 2018-05-26 06:45:05
Kind gesture to thank all the new bagholders you're probably going to dump on some time in the future.
@_date: 2018-05-25 07:42:55
Yes, it's a very stupid idea. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 07:15:12
Yes, that's why people constantly get scammed of their Bitcoins. "Be your own bank" is just an euphemism for "Sorry for your losses". 
@_date: 2018-05-26 07:17:07
YOU'RE A LEGACY! Totally TRUST you! Will sell all I have and buy some BITCOIN!
@_date: 2018-06-15 07:47:17
But who cares then? Some anarcholibertarians and right-wingers like Stephen Bannon? It's a serious question, because I see no benefit in it. It should be trustless, but it isn't. You have to trust in people to not lose interest and cash out, you have to trust in people that they just don't shift to the nearest fork. There is nothing exclusive to it but people saying it has the most resilient history. But history is no linear thing. It can change. Any time. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 15:24:01
Wait until they are tracking your mum's every move on the blockchain. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:10:40
Question to all the Bitcoiners in here: The market is highly centralized around Bitcoin. Why the hell don't you promote a decentralized market with even chances? Decentralization is only good when it suits your narrative?
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:11:22
Why should ANY institutional investor buy a useless, energy wasting funtoken? Really, I don't get it.
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:12:52
No, because there has to be INTEREST in Bitcoin for a big pump. But the sentiments are BAD. REALLY bad. Why should anyone with a sane mind enter a market that got burned in one of the hugest bubbles in recent histories? Do a reality check.
@_date: 2018-06-04 15:23:41
Yes, because the internet is a free protocol, that has to be blocked by the great firewall of China, whilst blockchain offers all the nice possibilities of tracking anything. Libertarian's wet dream has become the communist's wet dream. 
@_date: 2018-06-04 15:16:50
Another one escaped the asylum. Someone has to make a call.
@_date: 2018-06-04 15:20:37
It has been becoming more and more acknowledged for years now. We are just on the brink of mass adoption. Oh, and institutional money is coming in any minute to buy our precious, adopted, energy efficient and in any way supreme cryptocurrenzies. /s
@_date: 2018-06-04 15:46:15
No. And I won't. I hate centralized applications.
@_date: 2018-06-11 17:40:04
Everyone in this sub would keep their money in Bitcoin if it'd be stable, because it's the future of payments, right? RIGHT? 
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:11:13
Accepting or actually receiving? With or without the shitstorm of the Bitcoin brigade? But formal acceptance is all that matters to the speculators eye, RIGHT?
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:34:47
Yes, and the market is an ethically responsible identity and not just a representation of humans greed. Got it.
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:39:53
Maybe I'm just not Bitcoin enough, because I'm actually really concernced about this issue. It was predicted to happen to ETH first and now it happened to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:07:36
Too much valid criticism and too less "This is actually good for Bitcoin haha".
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:27:43
...or declared a non-issue by some big players opting for a society where owning any type of content is no crime and a prize society must pay for this huge goal of decentralizing anything. Is it presumptuous to call this delusional?
@_date: 2018-03-22 19:27:04
Thank you, this is actually a useful explanation!
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:36:09
Can you post this perspective full of whataboutism outside an echochamber without getting reasonable and valid counter-arguments to why your argumentation is bullshit? I'd call this the "communication bubble litmus test".
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:08:55
There will always be enough miners taking the risk of having childporn on their drives. So this is good for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:21:02
What a moron. Sorry. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:03:58
Not just porn, that wouldn't be problem. And joking about it doesn't make the matter go away. It's a problem that illegal content is distributed to every user running a node. But let me guess... this is good for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:06:07
Dude, it's not about being available but being immutable and distributed over every user sharing the blockchain. This is a far more delicate issue and one huge downsides of decentralization. CONTENT on the internet on the other hand isn't decentralized but can be run down to a single or a few servers, making the owners accountable. But yes, just FUD...
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:58:58
Thank you stranger on the internet for convincing me, that actually I am the one driving on the false lane. :)
@_date: 2018-04-20 09:39:23
One can hope! What worth is Bitcoin if its volatile? It's meant to be a CURRENCY. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 08:06:20
For what? It's perfect! Bitcoin loses every value (not saying price) when it's volatile. It has established itself as the standard pairing and therefore it should behave like that. 
@_date: 2018-04-20 15:25:42
Oh, talking corruption I don't know if this scamhole named crypto is in ANY way better than the existing institutions. At least THEY have the regulations in place.
@_date: 2018-04-20 09:18:50
But before that you Need more greater fools to become rich quickly? What if Bitcoin stayed at 8k? Would you USE it daily as the currency of your choice? Think about it, Bitcoiner!
@_date: 2018-04-20 11:52:40
Doesn't change the nature of the underlying asset, does it? It still lacks the most important features of a currency.
