Well I'm assuming given enough time, a mesh network could be made to be just as easy to use. Also while there are plenty of VPN solutions and stuff to get around blocks, they aren't really trying because they know that only a small group of technologically savvy people can do it. Things get much more aggressive when the technology is accessible. Case: Popcorn Time. It was too easy to get pirate content so the response was aggressive.
Again, I do agree with your points and there may be other technologies that can make this work, but realistically your ISP can do whatever it likes with your traffic and as long as that's the case I don't see workarounds like the one you propose getting to be easy enough to use for the masses.
I hope they do though! If not - new internet for me.
P.s. I really don't want the current internet in my brain so when we get brain machine interfaces, I'd like it to be hooked up in a mesh where I have full control.

I'd probably buy ethereum... :)

Also re bittorrent - there is a witchhunt of epic proportions going down to take down torrent sites. It is actually effective and tbh for most people why bother when they have netflix and amazon etc.

Agreed, but the reality is if a site like coinbase was blocked by an ISP, for probably 90% of people essentially cryptos are blocked. Technical people will probably always find a way, but the masses not so much.

I think the next level of this, is that decentralisation allows prices to come down by an order of magnitude. Maybe not for everything, but for the 90% of things creating a very strong incentive to use them over existing centralised services. At least I feel this order of magnitude decrease in price is *needed* for people to willingly move to more secure solutions.
