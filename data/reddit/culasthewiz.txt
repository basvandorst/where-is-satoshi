Don't forget about taxes.

What are you doing about taxes?

"Conversion Fees
You are not charged a conversion fee, or any other fees, to buy or sell Bitcoin through the Cash App."
must be looking in the wrong place.

Have a writeup on this?   I have a 4 tap keezer and would love to try this out!

Really?  What a terrible thing to say.  OP, disregard this jerk.

This may not be popular but I prefer to keep most of mine on paper wallets.
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:13:39
If the BTC were residing on Coinbase at the time of the fork, they have stated that you will not get BCC.  This could potentially change.
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:39:09
Will you eat your dick on national TV if not?
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:36:35
True.  That backup is for the seed though - not your actual private keys.
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:04:16
It's best to control your own private keys.  For you to do that, you can use a software wallet (like Mycelium), a hardware wallet (like a Trezor) or a paper wallet.  They each have their pros and cons but for long term holding, a hardware wallet is probably your best choice.

Ver could pump a veritable shitload of his BTC to BCC...
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:31:21
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:33:57
Well it's Bitcoin related so, yes.
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:10:27
You're right for longevity's sake but the extra security measures of a hardware wallet appeal to me.

I have not done this myself but theoretically for Amazon one could easily make a disposable e-mail address and ship to one of their Amazon lockers.

After trying about 20 times, I was able to get a withdrawal out about 20 minutes ago.

All time high, I guess.
@_date: 2015-08-17 18:16:23
Yes but the potential of implications of cryptocurrencies are larger than many other more passé inventions.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:22:14
In case someone is wondering, here's what I did:
I first used Mycelium to sweep my paper wallet balances into a new HD account (just to be sure I'm protected against replay).  Then I used Coinomi to sweep the BCH addresses over.  It was waaaaay easier than I made it out to be.
Now I just need to figure out how to sell this crap.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:08:14
Thanks a ton for responding.  I'll check into this.

Decentralized ledger.

@_date: 2017-09-15 04:43:13
I certainly agree with that.  But I'm sure they overlap quite a bit.
@_date: 2017-09-14 23:51:06
I wouldn't say it's entirely speculative.

It's used snarkily as an indication that you should simply search for an answer to your question because you will have access to more information than someone here would provide.

This is like someone arguing about the practicality of a gym sized computer as being applicable for home use in the early 70s.  We're still early stage.  Let's see what the future holds!

I have a client who received support from Pineapple Fund and, while it took them a bit to figure out how to do it, they cashed out within a few months.

Yes.
