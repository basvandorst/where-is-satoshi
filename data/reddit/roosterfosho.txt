I honestly think you're more than fine. Some people would disagree, but then again it's reddit and most things here are overkill.
For example - Paper wallet from a hand built machine on an OS you created yourself in an undisclosed language with fingerprint and sperm testing to start the OS.

That was almost funny.

There aren't any rules in place to mitigate the effects. That's investing for you.

A rooster also known as a cockerel or cock, is a male gallinaceous bird, usually a male chicken. Immature male chickens less than one year old are called cockerels. from wikipedia 
And thank you.
Feels weird I never usually post.

If anyone has read the comments on there it's absolutely ridiculous the way people are spouting off about how he got the initial investment.
Jesus Christ some people are ridiculous.

Not gonna get the responses you're hoping for.

Will there be interest? Yes.
Is it possible? Probably not.

I would assume it's not feasible because I don't think anyone would be willing to put it together.
Granted, there's only about a week (I think) to establish the funds. I think this would be the main issue, combined with the fact even if the group were to somehow get approved at a discount of $500 per BTC it would still be upwards to the amount of 13.5 million (and I'm not even sure what types of taxes would have to be paid on a gov auction)
So even if you get every subscriber in this sub to join, most of which I would assume don't have the money or wouldn't be willing to partake, that's 122,000 people. It would only cost $110 per person. 
But that's IF you get every single person. I would say a more realistic amount of people would be 20,000 and I feel like that's still generous. For the deposit that would be $10 a piece if everyone were to chip in equally. And $675 per person to purchase the coins at 13.5 million.
Now that I typed those numbers out it doesn't seem too unreasonable, but I still don't think it's very probable. Plus I doubt the coins go at THAT much of a discount.
However, if we were to try and pool together to purchase the single block that would be much more realistic.
Idk if any of this shit I just posted even makes sense I just did some rough math so if I'm completely wrong someone tell me to fuck off please.

Hahaha I didn't think anyone would actually do it. Thanks man I'll make sure to keep passin it on

Looks like it worked. Thanks again my man. Roosters have been my shit since I was a child. Maybe I like cock or something....

.........I'm pretty sure this just screams no.
What stops you from stealing money from them in the future?

I'm not entirely sure why you believe they will go around market value. Not too many (single) buyers have 13-15 million sitting around to invest, let alone in BTC.
Could you explain further?
