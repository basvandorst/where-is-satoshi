Another old guy here - it's got me stuffed. 
Kids.

Man I have a serious man crush on Andreas. What a great soul. 
Such a stark contrast from the 'figurehead' of a certain competing coin. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:28:13
Wow. Nice tip alright. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 11:43:45
Brilliant

Or invest it in a global campaign to re-green the Earth to help suck out the shitload of carbon that we have dumped into the atmosphere. 
That's my dream when I hit the jackpot anyway.

Some of what you say sounds informative and sincere, and then you blow it all to bits with your last paragraph there. Credibility gone. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:04:33
He appears to be...... how do you say it, a wanker?
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:49:28
Talking about the identity of the creator of Bitcoin is 'off-topic' in a Bitcoin sub? Incredible.

Aaaand...... here is the FUD we all knew was coming, the futures short sellers can drive it down, and then quietly scoop them up at a fraction of the cost. 
Listen to Ronnie Moas being interviewed in the Bad Crypto Podcast. He predicted this.

They sleep with their eyes open. I work with a lot of people who also seem to do this daily.

Is there a reason why this doesn't show up as having any upvotes? Is it just me or does everyone see the same thing?
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:41:01
Yes. Well said. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:49:08
That's a philosophical question.....why do you care that I care?
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:26:36
Vertcoin! I hope. 
But IOTA for sure. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:54:45
I second this
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:59:35
Let the FUD spread! Buy the dip. Ultimately it will bounce back
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:45:30
Here have an upvote. To the top my friend!
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:47:32
Dead set champion. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:04:17
Do they take Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:31:45
Man is he a clown. What a self promoting wanker. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:53:27
Joffrey 
@_date: 2018-05-07 08:13:31
Agreed. Legend indeed. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 08:15:29
No need to give this clown any more attention  
@_date: 2018-05-15 22:15:23
It's a black fly, in your Chardonnay 
@_date: 2018-10-16 11:51:20
Nice! Is that a Datsun 180b ?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:07:36
I'm buying. These are the times you look back and wish you bought. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:54:27
I'm not 100% up on all this, but if there is 160k more to be sold, getting rid of them at a rate of 5 per day would take just over 87 years
@_date: 2018-02-04 01:10:10
Agreed. 
Listen to OP, people. This guy knows what he is talking about. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 11:05:46
No cell phones over here. Mobile phones, yes
@_date: 2019-09-21 11:54:36
I was expecting him to end it with... ‘buy bitcoin’
@_date: 2019-09-21 11:22:12
Turn out the light
