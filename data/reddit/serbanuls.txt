Man, i know btc its good, that week were week to buy cheap as you said. But a lot of people dont think like us. They just continue the fud. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:44:21
Better to move your BTCs. You dont want to be in that scenario 
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:09:15
With 'just' 20% correction a lot of people will oversell and that can be a gamechanger and trigger an altcoin rally
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:16:36
Ummm i used to hold omg but they failed to me with that google fake news. Was not fair. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:13:28
Lool CME is not confirmed, if CME declines to add BTC it will ve the begging of s big correction. Will be like all China fud
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:42:09
So yes, you think BTC is starting thid 20-30% decrease, a lot of people is waiting for alts rally

Nope, you should send your BTC to a wallet where you own the private key, for example i have a Ledger Nano S that is a hardware wallet, but if you want something free you can try exodus or electrum. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:33:01
Btc or all the cryptos in general. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:16:22
Wow count with me

To summarize: descentralized exchange, world fastest blockchain with its new NG protocol, and fiat gateways.  I think also they will add Smart Contracts but that will take more time.

wavesplatform.com i found it at coinmarketcap.com 
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:56:28
Im looking at waves, seems a solid coin completely undervalued. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:40:10
Fcking high fees. Its what i hate more of BTC
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:07:40
Yep thats why im considering it
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:43:43
Ofc, i started with 17 too, the best way to get more BTC i think is trading, but its not easy
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:57:43
maybe you can find something in localbitcoins, i live in Spain and here we have something called BitNovo that is similar to PaySafeCard, you pay with your cash and they give you a code, then you put that code into the web and they will send you the btc to the adress you have put in the form
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:52:37
Since i was 16 i worked in online bussines but when i discovered Crypto-world i moved all the money i had and invest it into BTC and other alts. Then to increase that amount i trade my alts when i thought i had a good profit
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:59:45
Yes they are safe, but be sure your PC is safe. I personally recomend to use an exclusive PC to store your BTC, if not just be careful.
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:18:30
Im also looking at wagerr, sport bets its a great market
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:45:37
Wasnt a question, i mean all crypto-world can win the war vs fiat, for me btc is like gold, so i won't pay with gold to buy things, there are other coins that can do that task much better than BTC
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:46:01
What i see is a lot of FOMO this week. Not sure if now but will be a correction 30% or maybe more 
@_date: 2017-11-18 14:19:16
Recent news said that boss of Mt Gox must pay juts the value of $$ of the BTC in that dates, the rest is for him, so now he is rich. :(
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:47:37
Im thinking to enter in some of them, but i feel confortable now in BTC ^^
