This is the key part for me.  I don't care what you say about core, if you can't attack segwit and prove it is bad then stfu and stop attacking because you just look like a scammy fool.

Other coins are not bitcoin and are not used as much as bitcoin, there is a galactic difference in usage between bitcoin and any other coin.  So you admit that the limit was put in place to stop blocks from growing beyond 1MB but you fail to show how opening the flood gates is the right thing to do.  The limit was put in place to stop blocks from growing and to prevent spam because the theory was that it would make spam expensive and that would discourage it and that has been proven.  The limit is working and we can't raise the limit beyond the threshold where the limit enforces the rules.  There are many rules that are not easily seen and they are all affected by lines of code.  In the mean time core has found and implemented a very good set of code that fixes many things while still preserving the limit and its affect on the rules while allowing for us to raise the block-size later in a responsible way.  Cores code has been vetted and tested.  We really need to see how LN is going to affect tx traffic with segwit and what the appropriate next size should be if any.  Any argument against needs to be backed by facts and a deep analysis of the implications and I just don't see that from the big block crowd pushing for a hard fork.  We trust Core exactly because they are making the right choices that move us forward responsibly.

[Blockstream is a blockchain technology company co-founded by Adam Back, Gregory Maxwell, Austin Hill and others, and led by Adam Back and Gregory Maxwell. Blockstream provides funding for the development of Bitcoin Core, the predominant network client software.](
  
If you do your homework you will see that the people affiliated with blockstream are some of the giants in this sector.  The creator of Bitcoin went so far as to cite Adam Back's previous work as the foundation for bitcoin.  As best I can tell, there is zero reason to believe the narrative being pushed by the HF(hard fork) crowd.  So be wary of negative things said about blockstream.

Segwit2x is a hard fork and people don't support it because of that.  It is also a block increase decided before we can see how things like LN affect the network which makes no sense because we don't know how side chains will affect the network and how much the block needs to increase if at all.
  
So again this is the tired arguments from the hard fork crowd trying to convince us to hard fork.

Isn't it neat how we have this system that self regulates itself so no one party has too much power?  We are literally watching this power struggle unfold every day around here and it is so darned interesting to watch.
  
A recently re-read up on the timeline for the block size limit and how we arrived at it.  It was because one segment of the population had too much power to affect the economics of the network and this threatened the balance we need to keep incentives where they need to be to promote sustainable growth.  We don't actually have the technical capability to support everyone with bitcoin alone so there will always be people that aren't included until we have solutions that serve everyone.

No you can build ASICs, but if you find a way to build one that has a huge advantage and you decide to patent it and then use that patent to force out everyone else and build a mining monopoly thus destroying our security model, don't expect us not to act, we have no choice but to act. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 15:03:49
If a miner is able to patent technology that gives them an advantage over everyone else, I see no reason not to change the code to remove that advantage at that point.  We are not here to facilitate monopolies especially when those monopolies weaken our security model.  This is exactly what would happen if a company held a mining advantage.  The only thing that matters is security and a PoW change needed to enforce security, whether it is to avoid a flaw or help enforce decentralization is absolutely valid and possible.

They can't plausibly claim that they didn't know they were serving someone from North Korea if your IP is from North Korea in their logs so they have no choice but to stay on the safe side because of liability.  Look up what regions they serve and only connect from those regions to be safe.

People see it as a good store of value because it has done nothing but rise in the long term.  The entry point is pretty low too since exchanges are so prolific and have relationships with traditional markets for easy conversion.  People are familiar with signing up with online services at this point.  This is fueling huge money because many feel that our systems are corrupt and rigged against them so they want a place with a more even playing field.  This desire by the populace has always been present and only lacked a vehicle that overcomes the issues of trust and bitcoin is the first to do that.  There are many more factors but I see these as the most important.  We have this new fangled financial system that is fair and the entry point is low.  It comes with high risk and a reward proportional to that risk.

@_date: 2017-06-06 17:10:57
Certain groups think they can handle a hard fork of bitcoin and sustain a second chain.  If done right this is a good bet financially for them.  They know that if they don't get a fork now, it might never come so they are pushing hard.  To have the only working fork with almost a decade of history on the most trusted blockchain would be a big deal.  So they are pushing for one and they look like they are willing to lie, cheat and maybe steal to do it.  This is why you will always see the other side insist on a solution that hard forks, it is the entire reason for their aggressive behavior and the reason alternative clients like BU are backed.

@_date: 2017-06-11 16:21:44
You did not explain how transaction fees will go down when blocks are full.  You said that something called standard transactions would shrink and this implies this standard transaction is worth more than another transaction, maybe a substandard transaction?  Clarification is needed here.  Also an example of what you classify as standard transactions would be helpful.
  
In the future I expect a lot of competition from L2 and others for block space and since we cannot raise block size forever or even very much right now, there should always be a healthy fee system for miners.
  
Also, it is hard to imagine a mechanism that can preserve "excess capacity" that doesn't create a new attack vector.  Maybe you can articulate one for us?

The majority or core is not going to commit to an arbitrary blocksize increase so don't believe the marketing.  A hard fork to increase the blocksize will not come from core and I would bet all my bitcoin that the majority of hash power is not going to run Segwit2x software that isn't even finalized.  So you are wasting your time unless you are paid for this.
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:06:08
I like how you try to argue that miners will lose money in fees while admitting that blocks will still be full.  Full blocks = fees.  Get some new material because this argument is tired.  Or you know, you could explain in detail how fees on the bitcoin blockchain will arbitrarily go down when capacity is at its limit(it should always be at its limit).

If miners demonstrate they can effectively attack and disrupt the current system then it could be changed.  PoS?  I don't know.  PoS doesn't sound so great to me because it empowers the wealthiest.  People argue that is how it is now but with changes to PoW, who's got the power can shift from big asic owners to a combination of something else more evenly distributing the minting power while preserving\creating opportunity.

I bet it has more to do with the price not updating correctly when they are having issues like they did yesterday.  They probably got a shit ton of support tickets complaining that the price said X but was Y when they logged in.

Uber is an interesting example because their downfall is actually centralization and not being displaced by a better product.  Do some research on Uber in China, it is really interesting.

It looks like your fee would depend on how you structured your order.  If you were patient you could cash out whatever amount for 0%.  
  
But you have daily withdrawal limits to deal with.

I don't speak for Core but I feel pretty comfortable saying that Core is not a cohesive group that will compromise like that.  **It would be a legitimate reason to attack them** instead of the propaganda used today.  If Core as a whole agreed to compromise and implement a fork that literally does not fix anything, they would then show that they can be coerced into implementing unneeded and controversial code.  They have our trust and support because they do not compromise for special interests and I don't see them starting anytime soon.

When it was happening there were tens of thousands of transactions being created a day that had no chance to confirm so I would be really interested in a graph that shows the transactions that did not confirm and were dropped.

I think it is safe to say the majority is firmly in agreement that segwit is needed.  A blocksize may or may not be needed depending on how segwit affects the network.  So no, most people with a brain do not agree it will be necessary, but it **may** be.  Words are important.

There is a real possibility for overwhelming consensus on August 1st.  Miners have no incentive to speak up and be loud right now because they risk pissing off the largest supplier of miners in the world and that makes no sense from a business perspective.  But it is in their interest to keep the playing field level.  My money is on us getting segwit in August.  So how about lightning by Christmas and New Years on the Moon?  :)

It is each contributors best interest to show that they make decisions based on the code and how it affects the fitness of the system.  This is not politics where compromise is often used to move progress forward.  This is codified money and all that matters is the system and its fitness.  If they compromised in that way it would be a legitimate reason to attack them instead of the propaganda used today.

In the end it is still a scam, customers would have been better off buying btc directly instead of the contract.

As a coinbase customer for a long time I can tell you that I have received no phishing attempts that would lead me to believe my relationship with Coinbase is known.
  
If you want to get all tinfoily then you should consider that Coinbase is resisting a broad request for access to customer records and this is possibly hindering other agencies in ways you may not consider.  There are times when an agency needs to know something about someone but cannot risk targeting the individual even in secret as it could compromise something very sensitive.  In those cases what they will sometimes do is issue a broader request that sweeps up the target while obfuscating their intentions from the provider.  If an agency wants this info bad enough and can't get it through these methods they might just attack Coinbase in an effort to get it.

I appreciate this reply because I feel your intent is good.  But I also can't just go along with it either without something else.  Look at the price of bitcoin and it seems like forks aren't even a consideration.  I don't see how people can talk like a drop is guaranteed or if it will even be relevant in terms of today's prices.  What if the price is 3500 and we end up where we are today or yesterday, where does the gamble in exiting pay off and does it at all.
It makes me wonder if it is all just alt coin pumps or if I am really not making the right decisions.  You see enough and you question.

Things like monopolies and patents are easy concepts for people to understand, especially the bitcoin community at large.  These concepts helped bring us here.  I don't think it would be difficult to communicate the situation to the general population.

He's just saying what a lot of people feel.  There are not a lot of places to buy mining equipment so when the worlds largest supplier of miners is attacking bitcoin the way they are, it is no surprise miners are not speaking up themselves, the incentive structure isn't there.  But it is definitely there to throw support behind segwit whenever they feel it can win.  And they may do it on August 1st.  The more I see Luke-Jr getting attacked the more I believe it will happen.

It wont be bitcoin or monero or zcash in the future, it will be all of them as decentralized asset exchanges mature.  I can imagine a day where a single transaction using a DAE(decentralized asset exchange) client can be easily split between multiple protocols depending on who is the best(and cheapest) that day.

I read your post and you are not here today, you are talking like this is months ago.  You want us to calm and propose a compromise in some misguided belief that it will show a hand we have already seen.  Again, get your head out of your ass.
