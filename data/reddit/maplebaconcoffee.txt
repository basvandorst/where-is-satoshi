Part of my job involves work with Interpol.  I will say this much, Bitcoin isn't just a Ponzi scheme.  We see a lot of criminals using bitcoin as an alternative to Eastern European banks who have begun to crack down on money laundering, arms deals, drug trading, and human trafficking.  I think it probably gets used for other things, but the black market is a huge use case for bitcoin, and why I think it won't just collapse tomorrow.
For bitcoin supporters, I'm not demonizing bitcoin, I'm not suggesting this is what bitcoin was designed for.  I'm explaining how we see it used in practice.
There are some attractive features of bitcoin.  Fraudulent charges are a bit harder.  It allows for siloing to reduce risk.  But I still don't see it having much utility in normal life.

Hello I'd like to hear you convince me about bitcoin.  Let me tell you a bit about my background and understanding.
I'm a scientist who works a lot in public health, and data driven-governance.  I am familiar with bitcoin primarily through my interactions with the criminal underbelly of the world.  I see a lot of use of bitcoin in individuals my offices have ended up helping prosecute for illegal drug sales, human trafficking, and weapons sales.
I'm firmly convinced that bitcoin will gain in value and continue to see use, but I believe that growth will happen due to the existence of black markets.  I don't think bitcoin is inherently evil, anymore than a gun, or knife is inherently evil.  They are tools, they have legitimate uses, and often times criminals co-opt them for less savory purposes.
I have trouble understanding the broad use case for bitcoin.  Especially given the lags on transaction confirmation, it will never be a viable technology for, say, grocery shopping, buying gasoline for your car, visiting a farmers market, etc.  It just simply isn't as good of a tool for everyday use as cash or credit cards and portable POS tech like Square.
I would like to hear how users use bitcoin right now, and any arguments you have for its growth in legitimate markets.

I still don't buy that the future of money is crypto.  I buy that crypto will continue to increase in value and be used in certain sectors, but crypto fails fundamentally as money.
I'm at the gas station, late to a meeting, and I want to buy a couple of gallons so I don't run out.  Can't use bitcoin.
I'm at the grocery to get some milk.  I want to buy some, but don't have an hour or two to wait for the transaction to clear.  Can't use bitcoin.
Bitcoin is fine for transactions with no real-time limits, but it fails as money.
@_date: 2017-08-11 17:28:54
The biggest issue with bitcoin is you cannot use it like money.
I'm no longer skeptical of its value, but the platform is completely incompatible with a trip to the grocery store.
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:04:20
btc-e was a Russian run firm.  I would never trust any Russian financial company with my assets.  Do you have any clue how dirty Russian banks are?
Maybe this is part of why the American people don't get just how damning Russian ties are for Trump.  Russian firms are at the heart of a lot of illegal business.  They're primary targets for money laundering busts.
You might as well go to a loan shark.  Kraken, meanwhile, is US based, and can't just run off with your money.

176,000 unconfirmed and counting: 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:36:52
It isn’t really FUD, though.  Hash power just massively realigned and the resulting transaction confirmation crisis should really give people pause when it comes to BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:30:09
The issue isn’t the price, I hope you understand.
It’s the unconfirmed transactions which are currently growing in an unbounded fashion.
They were at 140,000 yesterday.
This morning they are at 168,000.
They are continuing to increase.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:39:52
Thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:33:59
Centralization doesn’t have a single meaning.
Relying on three companies to provide infrastructure spanning multiple physical locations, independent failure groups, on highly reliable hardware is a great solution for decentralization and elastic scaling.
It’s not very cost effective as the TCO of cloud nodes is pretty high compared to home machines, but it’s far more reliable.  It does give power to the cloud companies, but it also doesn’t permanently bind the system to this arrangement.

Try selling your BTC right now.
Go ahead.  Transfer some into USD, or any altcoin.  I'll wait...  but it'll be a long wait:
Look, this sub really needs to drop the FUD.  Cryptocurrency has a lot of promise, but right now, BTC, which had been the broadest used, is at a standstill.  174,000 unconfirmed transactions and counting.  Currently the expected delay in getting a transaction confirmed is between 14.5 hours and 3.5 days.  
This is a massively unhealthy development and highlights the vulnerability of BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:41:16
There are 172,000 unconfirmed transactions, and climbing.
Bitcoin is essentially unusable at this point.  About 2,000 transactions are clearing an hour.  That means it currently takes 3.5 days to confirm a new transaction.
Bitcoin is essentially frozen at this point.  It's a massive vote against its suitability as a transaction medium.
@_date: 2017-11-13 23:38:23
Yes, anyone can pay outrageous fees to get confirmed.  If they:
1. Know what they are doing.
2. Aren't using a basic app.
Do you want more people to use bitcoin?  I thought the goal was broad adoption and fiat replacement?  This is not how you achieve that goal.  To achieve that goal the network needs to support **normal** users, not power users.  The fact that power users are fine tells us nothing about the health of the platform.
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:39:28
Ok.  And?
If a group can band together and lock out all bitcoin transactions for days... kind of seems like a major flaw, doesn’t it?
The consensus just shifted, and the results for the network were disastrous.
Strong vote of no confidence.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:44:38
Sadly you can.  Let's say you had $20 you blew on a Pizza back in late 2010.  You could have bought somewhere around 80 bitcoins.  That'd be worth $576,000 today.
But this is also like saying "Man if I had won the lottery..."
Bitcoin is/was a risky investment.  Most risky investments do not pay off.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:47:34
And you went from private wallet to private wallet?  Not exchange owned wallet to exchange owned wallet?
Because I have news for you, that's impossible:
The last six block chain was for trades started 2 hours ago.  And that assumes you were pulled from mempool for the transaction.
Exchange trades can be facilitated internally to "speed them up".

Part of my work is tracking down cases of financial fraud, money laundering, etc.  Bitcoin is heavily used in human trafficking operations.
This isn't a slam on bitcoin.  Bitcoin is like a rifle or a knife.  It's a tool, not a murderer.  You can read about some the uses of bitcoin to find human traffickers here (not me):


Privacy is a double edged sword.  It's not an absolute good.
I disagree we **should** be able to deal arms and drugs.  That doesn't elevate the human condition.  Just suffering.

You buy groceries with bitcoin?
I don't believe you.
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:51:38
My issue with BTC:
* No vendors use BTC.
* Transactions are so slow no vendors will use BTC.
* Transaction costs are high enough no vendors want to use BTC.
* BTC is hard enough to buy and sell most purchasers don't want to use BTC either.
If you are a drug dealer, arms dealer, or slave trader, BTC is viable and used.  If you are looking to launder money, BTC is viable and used.
But for people wanting to buy gas and groceries it's a non-starter.

The bitcoin benefit is money laundering is baked in and, and your cash can be moved to the boss' secure account by a lackey with zero trust.
It's hard to skim a bitcoin transaction, and there is no bank to play middleman for Interpol.
@_date: 2017-09-13 22:06:14
A bank account isn't a currency.
A bank account contains US Dollars.  US Dollars are valid for all debts, public and private, within the United States of America, and are fully fungible, working quite well as a currency.
The comparison to a bank account would be a BTC wallet.  My BTC wallet contains bitcoins.  No local businesses accept them for debts, to purchase goods, or to contract services.
Furthermore, if I want to spend my bank account, I have immediate access to those resources.  With BTC, I have to wait hours to confirm a transaction.  My grocery shopping just got a lot more painful, and I'm sure the customers in line will be pissed as we wait for confirmation.
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:55:17
It's far more anonymous than banking especially as banks have to cooperate with law enforcement and nation states.

Current cases can't be directly discussed.  Most trafficking cases are sensitive and take a long time to resolve.
I'm not arguing whether people should be allowed to buy guns or legal drugs.
I'm acknowledging the damage caused by the black market and the human toll.
Not to mention the danger of arms sales to insurgents and terrorists who often purchase WMDs and explosives on the black market.
Those are bad things, categorically.

I'm not saying bitcoin won't succeed.  I own bitcoin, I own etherium, I own lite coin, I own ripple.
They are solid investments.
I'm just saying the use case for the average Joe isn't there.  They don't support transactions except for institutional/criminal uses.
@_date: 2017-09-06 14:26:28
Sure.  It's a good investment, like I said.
But it isn't money.  It can't be used to buy things people need.
That's a problem.
Bitcoin's reliance on illicit activities makes it very vulnerable but also very profitable.

You used it in an inaccurate lay sense on a subreddit for enthusiasts.
And basic needs don’t have to be purchased?  Are you implying we should rob the grocery store?
You do realize the benefits of economic specialization, right?  If some people grow lots of food the rest of us can focus our time and talents on other pursuits, then we trade with each other, but because not everyone will want what others produce we utilize a fungible currency which has good liquidity, like fiat, to eliminate inefficiencies inherent to barter systems.
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:40:17
Jesus fucking Christ, you cannot attack a consensus driven process. You can attempt to push an alternative decision. But because of the way consensus works, you cannot force anything.

@_date: 2017-10-27 22:13:16


noun: laity; plural noun: laities
lay people, as distinct from the clergy.
ordinary people, as distinct from professionals or experts.
Usage of the word lay in this case denotes non-expert, and often incorrect use.
This does not imply highly technical or precise.  Simply correct vs. incorrect.
For instance, the lay use of "global warming" is thought to mean "Shit gets hot!" this is incorrect.  Global warming indicates global mean temperature rise, which can lead to regional cooling, and thus the lay implication is incorrect.

I know right?  Yesterday the bank came by and fucking robbed my house! Broke in through the window and stole my monies!
@_date: 2017-10-27 22:33:35


Lay implies inexpert, and thus the term lay has a definite connotation of "sometimes incorrect".


Words are imprecise.  They are simply well defined.  Precision, for instance:


marked by exactness and accuracy of expression or detail.
"precise directions"
synonyms:	exact, accurate, correct, specific, detailed, explicit, unambiguous, definite
Ambiguity is an inherent property of natural language, for instance.


Buying Bitcoin?!?!?  But you just said you used Bitcoin to mean "the block chain".  So I'm supposed to buy the block chain?  If you aren't even going to stick to your own definitions... *shakes head*.
Snarkiness aside, buying bitcoin doesn't matter an inch.  **SPENDING** bitcoin does.  Right now bitcoin is nigh unspendable.  Especially for the average person.  Spending bitcoin is everything.  Hoarding isn't healthy for bitcoin as a fiat replacement.
I wouldn't say I am a passionate bitcoin owner (again, Bitcoin, or bitcoin?  I thought you said these words were **precise**?  Yet you misuse them with reckless abandon...).  I think it's a good idea.  I own bitcoin as an investment vehicle, but as I cannot spend bitcoin in any meaningful way, it's useless beyond a speculative investment.
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:37:01


I noted that, yes, people who do not understand bitcoin improperly refer to it this way.  You just seem to indicate you do not understand bitcoin, which is fair.


noun: enthusiast; plural noun: enthusiasts
a person who is highly interested in a particular activity or subject.
"a sports car enthusiast"
synonyms:	fan, devotee, aficionado, lover, admirer, follower;

You gave definitions for Bitcoin vs. bitcoin as separate entities, then proceeded to ignore your own definitions.  Even disregarding the ambiguity implied therein (how does one determine which is which when beginning a sentence?  Is it your claim Ethereum and Litecoin use Bitcoin?  How absurd!), your own failure to use these terms consistent with the definitions you provided give ample evidence of the confusion inherent in such use, and makes strong argument against the use you provided.
If even you cannot use your own definitions with consistency, it seems highly suspect to argue they are good definitions.

And anyone who isn’t huffing gasoline realized it.
Something like $9,000,000 $12,000,000 bitcoins are transacted with each block.  Reddit users are not a large enough proportion to matter in the least.  Ergo “users on Reddit aren’t fucking spending it.”  Because Reddit users do not drive bitcoin volume.

Because I do buy bitcoin, and do want to buy bitcoin.
But for bitcoin to thrive, it must become a viable currency.  Which means I have to be able to do more than hoard.  I have to be able to **spend** bitcoin as well as buy it.

No clue.
No clue if does either.  Or I didn’t mention I don’t post there or read there.  They aren’t material to the conversation.  We aren’t playing “whataboutism”.

Miners are users.
Businesses are users.
The body of users is not just redditors.  Actually the body of true users are mostly businesses.  Because bitcoin users on Reddit aren’t fucking spending it.

No.  You sold an asset, waited several hours, then bought groceries with the proceeds of that sale.  That's like claiming apples are currency.
They aren't.
