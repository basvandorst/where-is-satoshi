It says pending. Often services will gather a few withdrawal requests together and send them in a single transaction to save on fees and unnecessary transactions.
Give them 10 minutes, and keep an eye on that pending status

Was waiting about 30 minutes for a confirmation only to discover my transaction didn't then make it into the block.

I'm using goxtool which runs on the command line and uses an ncurses UI.  You can plug in bot strategies (of which I know about 2), or you can just issue trade commands manually and watch the market activity.
I previously used a chrome extension that bought and sold based on EMA lines crossing, which looked pretty nifty but I didn't wan't to rely on chrome being open the whole time and I don't have computers sitting idle I can leave it running on.

My thoughts exactly as well, although I expect they have some international clout, or at least the US government does.
They've been known to use leverage over other countries governments to get them to enforce laws / treaties that suits them.  Not an area of expertise for me, but I'm thinking along the lines of "If you want to trade with us, you need to align yourself with us on this".

Installed it on my nexus 7.  Love the idea.
Some feedback:
I would get rid of the background bitcoin image or blur it or something to make it not clash with the price so much.  I find it a little ...busy.
Having the bid, ask, price, delay and last change all available is awesome, but PLEASE, get rid of the animation whereby the price flies down off the screen and is replaced by flying down from above.  I find this jarring and unnecessary.  Just replace the price in place.
This looks really promising and I would pay for this as is if the points above were addressed, particularly the animation issue.

I thought that their rationale for accepting bitcoin was about providing freedom of speech for people in countries that blocked "traditional" payments to wordpress in order to aid censorship.

Yes, my question is why might a miner be so selective.  It doesn't seem based on high fees as the fees for these transactions weren't that high., and only selecting 4 transactions would defeat the object of selecting on high fees anyway.

Some of the analogies used for bitcoin break down as you get into a more detailed understanding. I often see it written that bitcoins "are like computer codes" but in reality they are not.   Bitcoin addresses and their associated private key are like computer codes I suppose.
It's difficult (for me) to explain this correctly and succinctly as depending on your existing knowledge, each term I mention requires further explanation and generates more questions! But essentially, bitcoins don't as such exist, but what does exist is a (calculated) bitcoin balance. (whch I try to explain below).
To use your hypothetical situation... To say you have 50 bitcoins in your account really translates to... A number of bitcoin transactions have been made and stored in the blockchain that between them, assign a total of 50 bitcoins to addresses that you control i.e have the private key for.  So having 50 bitcoins really means you have the "access codes" to claim and reassign the 50 bitcoins from those previous transactions, by creating new transactions.
If I can rephrase one of your questions... "if I lose one PRIVATE KEY, then the coin will be lost forever for everyone?"
Yes, unless for some reason someone else knows that key, the coins are pretty much gone for good.  The chances of someone else generating that key co-incidentally is as good as 0.
If you pay .5 bitcoin to someone else, you (your wallet software) essentially generate a new transaction claiming 0.5 bitcoins from one of the previous transactions where coins were assign to your address(es), and assigning 0.5 btc to someone elses bitcoin address.
The thing is you can't claim part of the bitcoin balance from a transaction, you have to take the whole lot.  So in this instance lets assume for simplicity that previously a single transaction was made that assigned 50btc to one of your bitcoin addresses... You (your wallet software) would create a new transaction whereby you claim all that btc, assign 0.5 to "someone", and then assign 49.5 btc back to another of your addresses as "change".  In reality you would probably assign 49.495ish back to yourself as you often need to leave a small fee for the miners'
Hope that makes some sense.

We can't KNOW, but I find  this unlikely.
The question for me is so what?  Lets say he cashes out and crashes the price.
The fundamentals of bitcoin won't have changed so if you believe in the potential of the technology then a bunch of people who missed out on the cheap prices from months and years ago, get a bargain.

I think its a playful way of saying "no question too stupid".
If someone has a question but worries they will be seen as a moron for not already knowing the answer, then they needn't worry since this is set up for moronic questions, they are expected. 
Its a bit like the "for dummies" books, the idea being "We will assume you know very little as a starting point".
Thats my take anyway

Not to confuse by comparing bitcoin to fiat money and bitcoin addresses to bank accounts... but think of it this way.  I'll use £ as I'm in the UK.
If you have £100 in your bank account and I have £100 in mine.  If you want to transfer £10 to me from your account, what essentially happens is your bank checks you have enough funds and then subtracts £10 from your £100 leaving £90.  My bank then adds £10 to mine leaving me £110.
The 10 that got subtracted from your account did not have any codes or serial numbers to identify them.  It was just a mathematical operation.
The same apples to the £ that were added to my account.
But instead of my bank and your bank, we have a network of bitcoin miners doing that job. It's a slight simplification of the protocol, but in essence what they are doing is checking a transaction is valid (funds are available) then subtracting a number here and adding a number there.  The numbers themselves are denominated in bitcoins but that's all it is, a denomination like 1 centimetre, 1 yard, 1 gram or 1 decibell, which also don't have anything to identify them from any other.
The reason 1 bitcoin can be split into 100,000,000 parts is again, because it is just a mathematical operation, and computers can happily deal in units of 0.00000001 (also called a Satoshi)
Hope that makes sense.

Others will likely now as wallets will tend to inform you that you have unconfirmed (not yet in a block) funds.

I wasn't saying it was an issue.   Again, I'm interested in why a miner might behave this way. It's unusual.  I'm curious.  Hence the question "Why would they be so selective".

You cannot rely on buy / ask walls in the order book to give you a full picture of the market.
Using the trade API I can decide to buy every time the price hits 114 so it never falls lower.
Essentially an invisible wall, that (once your trading bot is set up) is easier to maintain, quicker to remove and doesn't advertise your intentions.
See : 
Editing to say, this is also a more reliable way to trade given how often the website is down.

Does this work when most of the Bitcoins are not up for sale as people are hoarding them?
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:22:36
I don't know whether electrum is any more secure than multibit (having not used multibit).
The thing I appreciate about electrum most is the deterministic wallet.  which you maybe already understand as you mentioned it.  Basically, as along as you use the addresses electrum gives you and don't manually import any existing addresses you own then those 12 words ARE your backup.
As to how you move over to Electrum.  Don't worry about importing wallet.dat.  Just get a receive address from Electrum (these are listed under the receive tab last I checked) and then use Multibit to send your existing coins to the receive address. Your balance should then update in Electrum (after a few confirmations).  Ta-da, your done!
No need to import wallet.dat, not sure if Multibit and Electrum even share the same wallet format or not.

A paper wallet is pretty much just a piece of paper that contains a bitcoin address and the associated private key you need to be able to claim / send any balance at that address.
There really is nothing more to it.  The only difference is they are printed on paper as this cannot be hacked into like a personal computer, online exchange or online wallet may be hacked into.
