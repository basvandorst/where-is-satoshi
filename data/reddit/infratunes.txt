Interesting concept! Thank you!

True this is what I was thinking. 
However with bitcoin we know the total amount of supply and when a coin is lost, it is lost forever.
The total amount of gold on earth is an estimation and lost gold can still be reused in the future (if found).

Isn’t a threat to bitcoin to reveal his identity given the million coins he owns?
