@_date: 2018-01-26 12:38:43
Posting a comment about someone posting about posting of hodling is useless even most.
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:19:45
This is good for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:18:45
@_date: 2018-01-04 07:42:37
The hodling is strong in this one.
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:21:57

@_date: 2018-01-08 12:46:30

@_date: 2018-01-09 11:43:26
In terms of tangible price, I'd say around $1,000,000 (just a gut feeling).

@_date: 2018-01-23 12:29:51
Look at the trends from the past year, both January and February are known for months that it will dip. I know past performance is not indicative of future results but still...

@_date: 2017-12-06 07:36:20
Tons of mixed opinions for sure. For me though, I think it would be bearish for a while and then bullish in the long run.

@_date: 2017-12-08 03:57:24
Thing is, I've been buying @ 4k and I still haven't sold those yet. I think it's more profitable if I hodl, to each his own.

If you're on Android, check out "Bitcoin Checker" in the app store. The alerts are pretty nifty too.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:09:59
Andreas vs Roger debate please.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:36:19
Yes. The dumpening will begin soon.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:15:56
Panic hodl!

@_date: 2017-12-21 01:23:00
The best is yet to come, HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:17:45
The best time to buy Bitcoin was three years ago. The second best time is now.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:11:50
Today's ath is tomorrow's dip.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:02:00




Pick one.

@_date: 2017-12-11 01:51:51
Still here buddy :)
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:30:18
Solid advice on day trading eh? I'd say buy and hodl instead. It's more efficient and profitable in the long run.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:30:53
10, at least 1m
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:30:49

@_date: 2017-12-15 14:28:13
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:07:04
Just hodl man. It'll go back up, don't worry too much. I've been buying before it hit $5k and have experienced far worse dips than we've had recently.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:38:01
Welcome back 15k!
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:43:32
Rule 8
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:27:31
Still in the awareness phase imo, this [post]( says it all.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:02:41
and we'll do it again
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:38:03
9:30 pm here atm. Gotta wait for the bcash dumping later.

Congratulations! And happy holidays as well.
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:24:46
Nah he's just fucking retarded.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:30:49
I'll rephrase it then. The latter **will** happen.
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:21:30
Give it an hour.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:34:16
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:19:55
This isn't a get-rich-quick scheme tho
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:01:52
Highs and lows for today?  
  
I got:  
High - $15,500  
Low - $13,900
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:34:06

@_date: 2017-12-19 12:21:30
You're welcome buddy! Keep buying and hodling till the moon... **your** moon. :)

Yes. Dollar Cost Averaging.
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:30:49
Brian Armstrong, that's what Roger Ver did.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:02:25
WOOT, now that's a word I haven't seen in a while. Congrats!
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:23:30
Good luck buddy. You'll need tons of it. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:12:28

Let's all give a warm welcome back to 17k!
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:15:13
Thanks for the cheap coins. :)

@_date: 2017-12-20 09:47:46
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:18:32
I *might* consider buying a Lambo for .3 BTC each.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:59:02
Probably a drunk hacked troll 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:39:53
Same, but with Gil.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:18:16
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:39:05
Yes, look into Dollar Cost Averaging as well.
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:10:14
Bearish for a while, bullish for the long run.

@_date: 2017-12-19 01:35:08
Damn. I'd rather gamble my money hodling btc and other cryptos at this point lol.
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:22:55
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:20:33
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:04:55
I'm going to go against the tide of the other comments here and say go all-in on BTC. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:11:03
[Couldn't get the 67 cents in :(](
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:32:35
Please do sell! SELL IT!
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:16:49
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:54:00
Invested at 4k. I'm a happy camper.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:13:18
Yes, but nobody knows when.
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:44:32
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:39:29
Network is clogging atm.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:01:44
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:52:34
and then?
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:19:55
Buy now and hodl
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:35:02
Bitcoin.org **and** coinbase.com
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:34:12
Welcome back 16k
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:46:11
I think there is already one, tagging @_date: 2017-12-19 11:58:57
Still going for $25k by Christmas.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:47:00
Hodl longer then.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:28:17
Invest those under 100 dollars into buying btc instead.
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:32:57
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:56:54
2018 EoY - at least $40k definitely
  
My intuition says $80k.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:31:30
Sounds like something Roger would use in his argument
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:05:49
Go ask more from Laguna then :P
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:17:32
Personally, I'm in it for the technology. Highly doubtful that the price will stay around 15k even if the Lightning Network gets released.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:27:19
DO EET
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:05:15
At least you got out of that hell hole and now you're here. It's never too late to invest and I surely hope you've learned your lesson.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:56:26
Pretty solid plan. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:12:49
25k by Christmas / EoY.
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:17:57
[This]( is you.
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:36:53
Not really an RIP but bought at $15.1k last night. Still planning on hodling though.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:30:04
Bitcoin is still far from its real value.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:24:27
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:44:55
This guy lifts.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:30:45
Gdax/coinbase down?
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:33:25
Hmm, may mga tropa na rin kasi akong napasok sa btc. Yung pinakamababang alam ko na napasok ng kaibigan ko ay 1k around last month pa. Nasa 8k+ usd pa ata yung value ng usd noon. Noong pumatak ng 9k mahigit, nakita niya ung profit niya na nasa 200-300 pesos kaya nagdecide siya maglagay ulit. Personally, medyo malaki na ung napasok ko sa btc kaya malaki-laki rin ung profits ko ngayon, around 4k usd pa ko bumibili bago ma-announce yung segwit2x hard fork. Kung di mo pa kaya maglagay ng malalaking amounts, I suggest you look into dollar cost averaging instead (in our case, peso cost averaging hehe).
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:48:36
Easily at least 40k next year.
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:49:28
But there's already a name with that fork... I believe it's called bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:01:46
I'd love that tbh. Payday!
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:19:09
No, let the holidays pass by and the price will rise just before you know it. Also, you don't lose money if you don't sell.
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:15:47
Gdax/coinbase down for anyone?
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:50:41
Oh. I see then.
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:54:20
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:44:29
Good job!
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:35:31

We're gonna reach 20k soon. I wouldn't worry too much.
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:16:00
15-25k end of the year
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:33:04
Yes! Just like @_date: 2017-12-20 13:35:50
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:55:00
Tbh I got into Bitcoin because of Bustabit. Lost around $80 and decided to keep my money in Bitcoin instead. Who would've thought.
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:28:23
Bye kids, thanks for the cheap coins!
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:38:11

@_date: 2017-12-10 11:49:36
 definitely.
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:29:13
Yes. Look into dollar cost averaging.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:45:35
No problem, as long as they accept bitcoin for charity donations ;)
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:42:44
$50k? Come on, surely you can do better than that :)
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:54:35

Ayos to ah. Sana may iba pang mga increments maliban sa 2k, hehe
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:29:06
At what price would the "soon" happen?
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:54:12

Have around the same as you! We'll get there!
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:49:01
Type HODL to pay respects
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:16:49
Let it drop to 9k, 7k or even 1k... I don't really mind. I'll just be happy that I can finally purchase a whole BTC again. :)
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:42:31
€7600 later... :)
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:11:42
Which would be considered the dip in the upcoming days
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:13:02
Hyperinflation. And to help you with your "not backed by anything" problem, I recommend reading the Bitcoin white paper at bitcoin.org
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:46:57
Mukhang bago ka pa lang dito brad. Dami ng pinagdaanan ng btc lalo na nung china fud lol. Walang-wala to doon.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:35:40
Buy more and hodl ofc
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:02:50
True lol, I can see that being a thing. Nice to see a fellow FF fan here (judging by your username) :)

Keep the hodling strong ;)
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:42:47
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:04:24
All good. Discounted Bitcoin for all!
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:29:48
I'd buy more at the dip... if I had more fiat.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:56:26

Done hehe xd
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:33:47
By that time, the dislike button will probably be on Facebook.  
  
'Roger Ver dislikes this'
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:09:44
Calm your tits. Once they open trading, watch it go ��
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:28:58
You're welcome. Nice chart.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:08:45
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:12:37
Currently using an Asian exchange, kinda interested. How would you pay though?
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:44:01
yesyesyesyeseyes  
  
Can't wait to get my hands on cheaper coins heh
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:02:01
No it wasn't. Look again.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:14:45


  
When that happens, my fiat will be ready.
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:31:26
One thing I like about Bitcoin? The memes, definitely. Seriously though, good job! Would you be implementing other cryptos in the future?
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:15:33
For now... Lightning network ftw!
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:48:04
Ye ma boi, buy and hodl lad
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:41:34
Made me chuckle lol.

Go to Zimbabwe, you'll find it out there.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:21:15
No worries man. Your future self already seems happier with the investment you'll be making.
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:11:30


@_date: 2017-11-29 10:57:00


  
But it's already above 10000 USD...
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:28:41
Probably because of the Coinbase maintenance thing and people being unable to access their accounts
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:48:42
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:07:07


Let me just consult my crystall ball...
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:32:53

@_date: 2017-11-27 04:39:44
In a few hours...
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:05:16
The addiction is real.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:24:45
Dipped until around ~8900 or so for a few minutes.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:48:40
@_date: 2017-11-23 11:20:31
I hope it goes to $9k :)

One thing's for sure, don't put money you can't afford to lose. With that being said, I'll probably recommend around $50 and see how it goes.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:44:47
I think 15k before futures and then sub-20k ish a few weeks after.

Same. I would really like the option of buying other cryptos. Also, I think coins.ph prices are a bit inflated when it comes to buying and selling btc.

Good read. Anyway, what platform do you use for buying/selling btc here in the Philippines? Coins.ph?
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:55:17
r/btc = BCash (BTrash)  
r/bitcoin = The Real Bitcoin (Bitcoin Core)

Yeah basta aware ka lang sa pagtaas at pagbaba ng presyo. Medyo malaki din kasi pagitan ng buying at selling eh. Mga 7-9k php per 1 btc.
