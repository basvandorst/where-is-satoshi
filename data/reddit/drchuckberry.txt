I think Cryptsy officially shat itself. I had 12 BTC, and now I have -1.2.
I've never heard of negative BTC, so this is all just super comforting.

I'm in the exact same boat. Purchased on the 21st, my bank account was debited on the 25th. Still at 0 on Coinbase as of the 27th.

I transferred two, and my balance says 10.

Fantastic info! You'd think that this would be more visible.

I sent  a message on Twitter. I'll report back if I get a reply.

For safety I've transferred two back out. Let's see if it works...
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:44:49
And now it's 12.....
My big worry right now is that Cryptsy doesn't know how much I'm actually supposed to have, and I'll lose the two I legitimately sent. Guh. Stressful.

It's happening to me, too. I figured it was just some glitch because I just transferred some coin from CoinBase.
Weird. I'd feel bad just transferring it out, but it's damn tempting =).

No, I transferred two in about an hour ago, and I just transferred them back out because I'm worried about losing them. I'll be the white hat and let them sort it out, but I'd rather not have any of my coin in there for a while.

Yea, I put two in. I had .6 in there beforehand, and a smattering of alt-coins. This isn't boosting my confidence in the trade engine!
