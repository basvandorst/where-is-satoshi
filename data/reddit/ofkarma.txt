This market manipulation is giving me a strange form of blue balls..
It’s as if J.P. Morgan himself is keeping Bitcoin from “climaxing” to 10k.

Can you tell us what his mother said? Not many of us know of DPR and there isn’t really much out there but conspiracies. Anything you can add on that subject would be very appreciated.

Dude you are dense as fuck. 
If the evidence that helped prosecute him is later found inadmissible, then it seems like an individual with common sense (unlike yourself) would believe that his prosecution was EXTREMELY skewed
@_date: 2018-12-21 01:22:50
Those charges were dropped of him hiring criminals, he was framed. Please please please... do some research.

Hahaha dude you sound like you know zero fucking things about darknet markets. He wasn’t a catalyst for shit. Pretty sure the markets back then were WAY more civilized than they are now and even then those markets hold morals now just as Ross did. 
Anyways, you seem to be some sort of pixie so I don’t expect you to have any sort of open mindedness towards things that could rustle your sensitive way of life 
Next time research your shit, bud.
