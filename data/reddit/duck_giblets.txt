On second thoughts..
It was a kiwi who split the atom mate.

Thing is, we already have a very decent banking system in nz, inter-bank transfers go through within 2h (excl weekends) and same bank immediately (incl weekends). Most people use cards, cash is becoming less and less common.
Cheques are unseen, very occasionally uses by businesses. 
I often don't even carry my cards as the cellphone suffices in many stores.
I do like bitcoin, it's easier than using a card in some ways (paying internationally for digital goods etc) but nz isn't a target market for it. Especially with security/companies like cryptopia going bust.

Our currency hasn't been based on the gold standard for over 100 years.. And before then, it was only used for a grand total of 21 years, briefly until the official bank of nz encountered financial difficulties..
The biggest argument people use is stability of government, but American people haven't really experienced a competent government..? At least nz is setting up guidelines for taxation around btc, and they're doing a really good job of it.
Taxes aren't evil.

I know what bitcoin is dude, just.. Don't quite understand how it's really that useful, especially in the nz markets.

Mm. People seem to be pushing USA politics on us, and crazy theories. What you're saying has a better idea of things, and the only way I could see it working.
But that may not be good for smaller countries with different issues. Here we worry about foreign markets and their impact on our economy. Suppose with uptake it'd equalise over time, but then it gets what.. Bloody after people disagree?

Government backs our currency. Unlike other countries (Venezuela comes to mind), our currency isnt doing too badly, and is backed by dairy and produce exports.
Our government isn't too bad, we have decent and free healthcare, decent roads, other public services.
What are the tangible benefits of bitcoin? Only benefit I can see is cutting visa and mastercard out of the picture.
Money or not, it's just numbers changing hand to indicate transfer of value/time.

Mate, coming from a practical standpoint, in a country where the sheer majority of people haven't had any bad experience with the banking system, nor trust issues with the banking system.. 
Why would we move to bitcoin? No what ifs, or hypothetical situations.
I have used bitcoin and for international purposes it is amazing, payment from nz - Korea made in ten minutes whereas international bank transfer would take 2 days and incur multiple fees.
But nationally bitcoin is not as easy to use, not as secure (as in, it is unsecured, the block chain itself is secure), and we have a pretty excellent banking and payments system that I believe not even the states has yet.
Also, eftpos (card based transactions, magnetic/chip cards) is virtually free for retailers and consumers alike, with only contact less, and credit cards incurring fees.
I get paid an invoice of let's say 15k from a completely different bank by a client. It's often there after the second hour ticks over. (say I am paid at 13:45, I have the money by 15:00).
I can then use that money to pay my taxes.. Dispurse as wages, pay suppliers and pickup or order more materials from other companies. 
Employees use those wages to pay rent, purchase food, pay electricity bills and other expenses.
Other companies use the funds to cover their overheads and wages, order supplies internationally, pay their taxes and so on and so forth. 
What would bitcoin do that this system does not already? That is what I'm trying to understand.
It's not about dividing of apples, and inflation is a thing anyway, would just be reflected globally (which is not necessarily a good thing for smaller countries!!)
Unless you mean one world government? Please no.

You're Dutch right?
Might be a good thing to note it was a kiwi who invented modern beer brewing techniques.

What about security, ie stolen phone or malware on the device or network? And email auth, or secondary password/pin for confirming transactions would be good.
Is insurance a thing?

Agreed. Half the shit is click bait

Presumably all connections to your servers are encrypted, and there is base level encryption on the app itself right? 
There's a reason many banking services and contactless pay won't work on rooted and jailbroken devices - definitely need a disclaimer there if one is not already present. 
I'm rather keen on an authenticator device you plug into the phone as a security measure if such a thing exists yet..
Very fast response!
I'm super keen for this to succeed, and can too easily imagine what will happen if someone creates fake apps or alters your own.

Based on total use, seems to be targeting larger operations. Makes sense if you read the article.
