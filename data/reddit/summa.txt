Gee, I don't know. Maybe to live in?

Cool, I'll call everyone in the world and tell them you have their life choices all mapped out for them. But seriously, some people want to live in a house that they've purchased for themselves; maybe they need backyard space, maybe they don't want to take the risk of sharing a home with strangers if they're renting a house, maybe they plan on starting a family in the near future and need stability, maybe the local economy has priced rentals well beyond the realm of affordability, maybe they just found a nice fucking house and simply want it. Don't be disingenuous and act like you know so much better what others need than they do. A house holds its value fairly well; you can't seriously be in the Bitcoin subreddit and talk about buying a home like it's a stupid idea. Actually, yeah, you probably could. This place doesn't surprise me anymore

The same thing could be said of bitcoins

i guess not... can you?
@_date: 2015-03-09 20:23:51
Okay, fair enough. I was focusing maybe a bit too much on the "medicine" and "priceless works of art" examples, but I can definitely see some tech-related products and services this would work for, and probably a few more traditional industries as well. Unfortunately, I still think mass adoption by the layman is not going to happen.

broken clock, etc
@_date: 2015-03-09 19:19:49
this subreddit hasn't heard "if it's not broken, don't fix it" huh?
this adds a layer of complexity to a transaction that nobody needs and i can't help but question if it actually solves the problems it claims to (and also to what degree these 'problems' even are 'problems')

Yeah, why not? He's free to charge whatever he wants, I'm free to do it myself, find a competitor or use his services for the fee he chooses.


Wherever people stop paying for said goods/services.
Why do you hate freedom, bro?

...What? What does capitalism have to do with anything? Although, now that you mention it, what financial incentive would a manufacturer, retailer, seller, whatever, have for using this? Cost of implementation alone for  (arguably almost) no benefit would scare any savvy businessman away

oh my god this whole website is retarded 
@_date: 2015-02-25 16:27:49
Some people are just passingly curious in the technology and don't actually care enough to buy any. It doesn't exactly take a lot of effort to hit "subscribe," and on reddit especially your average user has a lot of exposure to bitcoin, even just from commenting in totally unrelated subs. It's not hard to imagine a lot of people randomly end up here and think "Hmm, guess I'll check back on some of this in the future" and click sub.
