What does this even mean? Why would anyone not be able to afford Bitcoin at the higher price, they would just buy a smaller fraction.

This is it! This is the bull run we have been waiting for! We're going to 6500 babyyy!

You do understand the concept of an opportunity cost, right? Holding bitcoin for years, even if you don't lose paper value, is a huge loss because that money could have been in a different investment that is increasing.

I'm not saying investing in the past was a mistake, obviously there was a huge rise. But if you believe the market wont increase for 4 years, there is NO reason to hold bitcoin for that time.

The same way 1991 was the most important year in the USSR's history

I feel like Bitcoin sentiment has been really heavily damaged by this drop. A lot of people thought they were gonna ride the bull run forever, just seeing the bubble pop probably turned off a lot of people for good.

I think the magnitude is the big difference here. To some extent this was true for every crash, but this one had much more media exposure than any of the last ones, and reached far more people who view Bitcoin solely as a way to make money. There are only so many people who have the risk attitude and disposable income to be a significant Bitcoin investor, and I think this drop may have caused irreparable damage to Bitcoin as a speculative asset.

The best time to sell was in December. The second best time to sell is now.
