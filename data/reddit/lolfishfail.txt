Where is this clip taken from? What's the documentary called?
@_date: 2014-06-28 00:06:30
I'm completely new to Bitcoin, How exactly would I set this up? Because I want to embrace Bitcoin, but I also make youtube videos so it might be something unique I can add.
@_date: 2015-04-19 00:06:25
Seems like a sensible idea, given how stable bitcoin is.
@_date: 2015-02-15 19:11:02
Bitcoin is good.
edit: Okay then, apparently it's not.
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:35:55
Thank you for the help, Does Bitcoin tipping work on other Subreddits?
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:51:59
I apologise again, but I don't understand what this means.
@_date: 2013-11-25 08:44:15
What is this?
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:56:17
So, Is it possible for me to have two wallets?
I could use an Electrum wallet on my online machine and use the Armory one for just Storage of my bitcoins, Offline or on a USB?
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:59:09
Okay, I think I understand it now.
It might be handy for me to get a better offline computer then, I'm in this for the long haul, once I figure everything out. Thank you for the help, you cleared up a bunch of questions and have given me things that I can search for and learn about. I very much appreciate it.

So it's generated a Deposit address for me, but I don't actually have a wallet set up yet, How would I "transfer" the tip to a wallet on my desktop or vice versa?
Sorry for these types of questions, I'm really new to the whole system.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:01:30
Trust me, I'm working on producing Indie games for a living.
"Make Backups" is practically written on the inside of my eye lids.
Multiple USB sticks should be good enough.
@_date: 2013-11-25 08:20:54
Is it possible to just put £10 into it? I thought a bitcoin's value was $800+ or so?
Although you do make a valid point, I just need to figure out how to actually do it.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:32:12
"12 word seed"? I apologise, but I have no idea what that means.
As I said in the title, I'm new to this. :)
@_date: 2013-11-25 08:45:32
That's actually a sound idea, I could afford more realistically £20 per month or something, I also just got a bitcoin tip, do you know what this is?
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:58:24
I'm going to make it rain with my $6 lol :)
@_date: 2013-11-25 08:50:13
I see you bitcoin tipped me, How exactly do I use it? I've read the "what is this?" page and still am a bit confused. Using reddit as a money managing site, doesn't sound safe to be honest. I literally started reading about bitcoins yesterday, so forgive my ignorance. I'm still extremely new to this.
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:53:05
So, I could then forward that tip to a bitcoin wallet?
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:36:46
But how do transactions happen if my wallet is stored offline? There's no connection?
I apologise for the possibly stupid questions, I'm still trying to wrap my head around how this whole thing works.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:24:04
What if I told you that I don't own a Smartphone? Because I don't.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:25:51
That's what I'm looking for I think, Is this the type that can be backed up or copied to multiple USB thumb drives etc...?
@_date: 2013-11-25 08:22:36
Cool, I guess I could put a small amount into it then, and see what happens.
@_date: 2013-11-25 10:43:02
Thank you very much for the response, I think I'm getting to understand how this works now.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:20:27
Okay, Thanks for replying.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:31:50
Interesting, So it sounds extremely safe.
Do you have a password with it, or is it the password itself?
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:38:47
So this is safe from any type of attack or stealing?
Can it also be backed up on many storage devices?
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:53:57
Out of the two you suggested, which one would you recommend for a newbie?
Which one is more secure even? Is security even an issue with bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:59:46
Awesome, I've been watching a couple of documentaries about it, in fact I've just watched this one: 
It would seem like an idea to convert some of my savings to bitcoin, it's pretty exciting to learn about the system. I like the sound of it, The value of bitcoins are only going to increase by the sound of it, Being that there will be no more produced by 2040.
Long term investment sounds good, I can deal with that.
