So ... mining rigs?  That is an asset that is income producing.  Perhaps not profit-producing, but still meets the qualification.
This, of course, assumes that you value Bitcoin for Bitcoin, and not how it might be 'priced' (its perceived and currently traded value in relation to some other currency).
Income is income, whether its dollars, yen, Bitcoin, or vegetables from your backyard garden.  How much you value each of these is a personal decision.

The public keys themselves show up on the blockchain associated with a bitcoin address (a hash of the public key).  You *must* share the public key for asymmetric cryptography and the many applications like bitcoin, SSL, SSH, etc. that are built on top of it to work.
It is true that creating new addresses for each transaction could possibly introduce some difficulty for a casual explorer who might want to do some exploration of your spending through the blockchain web interface, but it isn't even a bump in the road for a decent analytics package.
Think about it ... [Target can tell when women are pregnant even before they tell anyone]( based on buying habits alone, [Facebook can tell when you're about to get dumped](  All it takes is a fairly decent analytics package to identify with a good degree of certainty who people are from their BTC spending habits, regardless of the addresses they choose to use.  Even things like tumblers can't change your habits overnight and are useless in this kind of analysis.
There are good accounting reasons to use different addresses for transactions, but anonymity or pseudonymity isn't one of them.
TL;DR: Misconceptions of anonymity or pseudonymity aside; there is a reason that public keys are called PUBLIC keys.

My thoughts are likely no more enlightening than anyone else's, but since you asked...
Putting trust in anyone else, whether a person or a company, introduces some risk.  This is true no matter what the subject of that trust is.
Choose wisely.  Do your research.  Know who you're dealing with, if possible, and have an idea of how and whether their attitudes and integrity may change over time.
Finally, and probably most importantly, have a backup plan (i.e., insurance, escrow, "no more than you can afford to lose", etc.).
Worse than Wall Street banks?  I'm not sure about that.  The problem with Wall Street as I see it is that they have institutionalized and largely legalized theft.  With scammers, it's just a little more obvious.  For Wall Street, as long as it's not you they're stealing from, it's all good; but the stocks and other financial instruments they trade gain value when the companies behind them work their labor force harder, for fewer rewards and benefits, and convince most consumers to buy things they don't really need.  Stocks go up, investors are happy, executives get big bonuses, and inequity grows.
Do I have a solution?  No, I'm not that smart.  Will Bitcoin change that?  No, but your question dealt with trust, not inequity.

Please read up (and have your children, too) on safe computing practices and information security.  Anyone can be duped by a company that isn't trustworthy, but following safe computing practices in the first place, and knowing when, where, and to whom you should limit your trust can certainly put a limit on damages.

I don't see it like that.  Most of the governments that I'm aware of don't feel threatened by Bitcoin, but many have seen their citizens duped by scams and criminal activity involving Bitcoin and are obliged to 'protect the masses'.  I can understand that.  The negatives aren't the only thing in the news, though, and many people (and governments, ultimately, are composed of people) see promise in it.
I agree with other posters here that evangelizing Bitcoin is probably not the best way to introduce people to it.  Be a knowledgeable resource, certainly, but avoid preaching the greatness that is Bitcoin.  People generally recoil from too much hype.  I want to see Bitcoin succeed, but subtlety would serve us best here.
The very idea that you can use something *other* than your own government's issued currency to pay for something is foreign to many, many people... myself included up to about a year ago.  Yeah, I knew I had to buy some local currency if I was traveling internationally, but that's about it.
This, in my opinion, is the biggest hurdle of them all.  It is a revolutionary idea that you can go to a store, either brick-n-mortar or online, and *choose* to pay with the U.S. Dollar, or Japanese Yen, or Euro, or Kroner, or ... Bitcoin.
It was this experience that led me to Bitcoin in the first place.  I wanted to buy something from a foreign (to me) supplier.  My local credit union, being small and having a low tolerance for risk, didn't allow international purchases due to the risk of fraud, and the vendor accepted Euros and Bitcoin.
The news about Bitcoin has largely centered around its price/value, generating some interest in the public and more for investors, but Bitcoin isn't really an investment any more than the dollar or yen are.
For my part, I've been asking how the merchants I deal with would like to be paid, simply to promote the idea that they *have a choice*.
"I received the invoice for the services you provided and can pay you in Dollars, Euros, or Bitcoin ... which methods of payment do you prefer?"
The shocked look and dawning realization that they have a choice is ... priceless.

Just an idea... MK is under a gag order.  If he so much as mentions BTC, or conveys anything that's really going on, he'll be arrested and extradited for violating a court order.
Tin foil hat stuff, but there's a lot more happening here than anyone in the public is being told.  There are very big players involved, not just in BTC, but in fiat, banking sectors, politics and governments.  People with billions in traditional systems.
Mark is sitting still in Japan, according to latest reports.  This is not someone who's afraid (yet) of assassination from the black market who he has most certainly done business with in the past.  This strikes me as someone who's more afraid of lawyers, police, and jail time (i.e., governments).
MK may have been an incompetent businessman, a political outcast, and is being set up as a fall guy, but the man is not ignorant.
IMO the banks have barred access to accounts and deposit boxes due to some injunction with cooperation of the Japanese government, and the gag orders and subpoenas prevent him from saying "boo" about it.

If your goal is anonymity (for whatever reason, whether you're engaging in illegal activity or plan to, or just want your financial privacy), then Coinbase alone or Coinbase transfers to a local wallet won't help.
Your personal information is associated with your bank, your Coinbase account, and any and all transactions involving those two, including sending coins to a private wallet, but...
Once in your wallet, the funds are just in an address (still linkable to you, because of the transfer from Coinbase).  From that point on, you can choose to transfer the funds to other addresses.  You can make proving that those other addresses belong to or are controlled by you difficult, since there is no personal information associated with those other addresses.
Transactions from your bank, to Coinbase, to your private wallet can be directly traced to you.  To prove that other addresses are controlled by you would require additional detective work.  This is not impossible, but not necessarily trivial.
To really anonymize your money, there are mixing services you could use (for a fee); but then you're in money-laundering territory, though, and simply using a mixing service might draw unwanted attention if anonymity is your goal.

Ask someone who bought MS stock in the late 70's and early 80's when PC's were primarily guaranteed to never get you laid.  Ask someone who bought Apple stock around the same time and stuck with them through the lean years.
Except Bitcoin isn't a company, or a stock.  Yes, it provides a service (reducing friction and fees to transmit the idea of "value").  Yes, it provides a product (the thing most people think of when they hear Bitcoin ... a currency).  Yes, it provides an application (securing and verifying transfer of ownership).
Those who can see past its current flaws and ugliness and lack of real-world "my grandmother can do this" usability issues are sinking their money into it, just as those who saw past early DOS and Windows' and Apple Lisa's and early Mac's flaws and ugliness and lack of real-world "my grandmother can use this" usability issues sunk their money into those early tech companies.
This doesn't make Bitcoin a ponzi, it just makes it *new*; largely misunderstood, clunky, and in need of a lot of fit and finish before the majority that now fears and distrusts it finds it indispensable in their daily lives.

I use FVE/BitLocker with TPM and mklink /D to symlink the %APPDATA%\Bitcoin directory onto a "Personal Secure Drive" encrypted via the TPM.  The PSD is only loaded when/if I need to get into the wallet, and any attempt to load or access it requires the hardware-TPM user password (which is pretty strong itself) and the wallet itself is encrypted with Bitcoin-Qt's encryption and a separate (strong) passphrase.
The "Personal Secure Drive" is 32GB, so I don't mind storing the blockchain there.
For the security-conscious, am I needlessly layering on too much encryption?  Am I exposing myself in some way that I don't realize?  Since the TPM keeps private keys in hardware, is this setup pretty safe from malware (at least while Bitcoin-Qt is not running and the PSD is not mounted)?

OP is absolutely correct.  Most of the big merchants that you're likely to run across, even *if* they accept Bitcoin, have been in business for a while and also accept something you may already be familiar with and are currently more comfortable using, be that U.S. Dollars (cash), Euros, credit or debit card numbers issued by Visa/Mastercard/etc. or even things like promotional codes and coupons.  I mention the last two because they, too, are things you can "trade" for something you want or need (or for a discount on something you want or need).
So why Bitcoin?  Why the hassle?


Actually, this is a surprisingly sophisticated question... don't short yourself.
I bought my first few Bitcoins at Coinbase because I wanted something from a merchant. ([Story here](  The merchant didn't take things like Paypal, my small bank (local credit union) didn't allow international payments due to their own lack of tolerance for the risk of fraud (which I understand completely), and even if I had Euros (I'm in the U.S.), I wouldn't know how to send them over the Internet, as I suspect most people don't know how to send U.S. Dollars (cash) over the Internet, beyond stuffing their CD/DVD tray with the stuff, and that never seems to work.
Back to the point, though.  Had the merchant accepted something I could easily send and that I had readily available to me, I would have likely gone that route.
But think about this for just a minute...  I sent a payment across the world, without a clearinghouse, without conversion (unless you count Coinbase), and without delay, directly to the person or people I wanted to purchase from.  If I were starting a business today, I would accept BTC out of the gate, and wouldn't even bother with merchant accounts, banks, credit cards, etc.  Easy enough to create a wallet and assign different receiving addresses for each customer, and have it "offline" so that only I can spend the funds, but employees are permitted to receive funds on my behalf.  I have set up merchant accounts in the past, and they too are a hassle.  More importantly, *anyone* can do this, from individuals to large corporations and governments.
The capability that Bitcoin has today to smooth out these wrinkles in the current financial system is big...very big, **and this is just the tip of the iceberg** (for a not-so-contrived example of where we're headed, think about transferring the title of your car to a family member, or even a stranger, with a Bitcoin transaction...no mailing documents around, no notarization required, etc.).
Back down to earth, though.  In every transaction, you trade something you have for something you want or need, whether that's Starbucks Rewards for coffee, or U.S. Dollars for groceries, or Bitcoin for software.  When you don't have what the merchant wants, you find some way to get it, like I did with Coinbase and Bitcoin, and continue to do at my job with my labor, skills, and experience for funds denominated in U.S. Dollars in my bank account.  It's all just trading something you have for something you want or need.
So, for right now, it may make more sense to use your existing credit or debit card online, but that's changing.  Maybe I don't want Target to have my information so they can lose it and expose me to identity theft.
The more consumers have Bitcoin, the more likely merchants are going to adopt it as an acceptable payment.  The more merchants adopt it as an acceptable payment, the more places you'll be able to spend it.  The more places you're able to spend it, the less risk you face as a consumer that the merchant is retaining information about you that could compromise your own financial well-being, and the cycle goes on.
Right now, I buy Bitcoin because I can envision what utility it may have *one day*.  That day might not be today, but it is certainly fast approaching.

Hmmm... hadn't thought of it like that before.  Bitcoin is a democracy in a real sense, rather than in a lip-service and corruptible sense.
By "lip-service and corruptible", I mean electing representatives who are *supposed* to represent their constituents speech, but equating money to speech and thus introducing bias.

I have given a lot of thought to this very possibility.
Then I am reminded of the late 80's and very early 90's, reading BYTE and COMPUTE! magazines, typing in the programs listed in their pages alone in my room on a school night to see a bouncing text-based ball.  Thinking "Space Invaders" was, like, the coolest thing ever.  Listening to the media at the time scoff at the geeks, making comments like "Who would ever want a computer *in their home*?!  Computers are for mega-corporations and governments doing census work!".
Living then through the relatively brief popularity of "Bulletin Board Systems" (BBS's) where you could dial up a local BBS operator with your computer and actually trade files (mostly porn at the time or games like "Leisure Suit Larry") with other BBS users.  This is how companies like CompuServe and AOL were born.
Along came DARPA and the academics with this Internet thingy, designed to reroute connections and be decentralized to survive even a nuclear war (OMG!!!).  Archie, Gopher, Veronica, File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP), Post Office Protocol (POP3), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  Wow, it was all so complicated and geeky.
Bitcoin, *in four years* now has the interest of media outlets like CNN, Forbes and Bloomberg; and not in an off-hand "on the lighter side, these geeks are playing with this magic Internet money stuff... awww, isn't that cute, now onto some real news..." either, but actually paying attention...closely.
That alternative view doesn't seem so legitimate to me anymore.

This reminds me of a piece that Isaac Asimov wrote that calls attention to a flaw in Euclid's geometric axioms (well... 'flaw' might be a harsh word).
In the essay, he points out that the "parallel" axiom is only true in right-angle/Euclidian geometry.
Hence, geometry (and proofs) are different in a universe based on acute or obtuse geometry; for example, in a spherical universe (obtuse geometry), parallel lines meet at exactly two points, and in the opposite of a spherical universe (acute geometry), parallel lines meet at exactly one point.
EDIT: Took me a while to find a [reference to it]( ... it's called "Euclid's Fifth". Excellent read.

Not convincing at all.  I often write my own ideas with plural pronouns.  At times to give them more weight, at times to indicate that my views have been built on top of others' or research from a variety of viewpoints, and at times to represent a community of which I am but one member.
TL;DR: If a professor says something like "...and if we take this value and subtract *x*...", it does not indicate that the professor has a mental malady (multiple personalities) or is in fact several people.

Your argument depends not on how *he* values $500, but on how *you* value $500...and without knowing for certain, I'm pretty sure the guy he gave that $500 to will value it even more.
OP seems to have done well for himself, in a fairly short period of time.  As he mentions elsewhere, he has a net worth at 18 that many won't see in their lifetimes.
Any combination of luck, intellect, recognizing and seizing onto this **very risky** opportunity called bitcoin in the early days when it could just as easily (and likely still can) completely flop could have contributed to the OP's current generosity.
That he is paying forward his own good fortune is something commendable.  I really wish we saw more of this, and I believe the OP's actions are how we will... imagine what the recipient will tell his friends.  Imagine how proud he will be to show his new computer that "some stranger" on the Internet bought him *just to show him what bitcoin was like*.
Believe me, that guy is now going to be buying BTC... and in the next bubble or two (because it will be a repeating cycle of bubbles until market saturation) he'll be the one buying a computer for the next guy...

Well, I can only speak for myself, since I have learned that everyone "values" Bitcoin at a personal level for completely different reasons.  For some, they see the charts and think "get rich quick"; for others, they see the potential to bring about the death (or at least a crippling blow) to existing corrupt financial institutions, and so on and so forth.
What Bitcoin provides *me* is a bet on an algorithm and (without getting *too* political) a true democracy.  The algorithms are SHA256 and ECDSA.  There's a substantial bounty (the current market cap, if you will) on breaking these, or even showing some flaw or weakness in the algorithm or Bitcoin's use of them to transfer and transmit the idea of "value" as a unit of account.  As far as the "true democracy" goes, it's the solution to the Byzantine General's problem...not just the "open ledger", but how can you trust than any participant is incapable of "gaming the system"?
Bitcoin is undervalued, IMO, and I'm not even talking about whatever price it happens to be trading at by speculators and "investors".  Bitcoin has already withstood many attacks, and will likely withstand many more... and yet, it's still here.
Yeah, I relish thumbing my nose at the big banks. I certainly appreciate that as more people become familiar with Bitcoin and what they can do with it and how it works, the perceived value of my own units of account have skyrocketed.  I can even appreciate the access it provides to the 'unbanked' and the ability to send value across the world in a matter of minutes.  But...
My faith is in the math and the ingenious solution to that "how can I trust this?" problem.
