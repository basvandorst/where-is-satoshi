It's just funny to me because I work in finance and have all the series licenses to call myself an FA, and no one in the industry would ever talk like this. It's like he googled what fiduciary responsibility is and then posted some echo chamber garbage

It’s not about being mistaken about something, you twat. It’s the way you decided to make a statement. You decided to spew nonsense about something you’re completely ignorant on and present it as fact, and then tried to play the victim when you were called out. You’re exactly the reason it’s harder to have a civilized discussion about anything these days.

So your investment selection strategy is better than most fund managers, yet somehow you keep generating either shitty returns/losses in traditional retirement accounts, which allow you to select your own investments?
Get a load of this genius

You know google exists, right? You don’t have to be this ignorant anymore

You fundamentally misunderstand how these plans operate. First of all, you keep referring to 401ks (or defined contribution plans, since you think somehow using the term “DC” validates anything you’ve said) as a fund. It is not. A 401k is an account. You *invest* your money in funds that *you* pick within the account. Typically you get access to around 20-30 funds with different levels of aggressiveness. 
A pension is a defined benefit account. A lot more people refer to this account as a fund, which is *slightly* more correct due to how you receive money from one, but still misleading. Pensions themselves are invested in different types of assets, they are just chosen by who operates the pension, not by the individual receiving the benefit.
Like I said originally, you could learn all this with the smallest amount of effort on your part, but you’d rather proudly spew your ignorance where other people can see it. People like you make having an actual conversation about stuff like this more of an uphill battle than it needs to be.

Don’t forget that he’s not an American, but that doesn’t stop him from having a lot to say about American politics for no reason

How is a 401k, where you choose your investments and your roi fluctuates with the market, in any way, shape, or form like a pension fund, where someone picks the investments for you and you choose between getting a lump sum or fixed monthly payments over time? 
I’m asking because if you could shed some new light on something I do for a career, I’d love to hear it.

Calm me down? Lol. This is you right now:
“Broccoli and carrots are the same thing.”
People that understand how language works: 
“No man, they are different foods entirely. They taste different, they have different health benefits, and they grow differently from each other.”
You: 
“Well I just meant that they are both healthy. If I called them both vegetables would that *calm you down?*
The way you talk about 401ks is both willingly ignorant and disingenuous to any sort of legitimate discussion around them. You should do some research before spewing nonsense all over the internet
