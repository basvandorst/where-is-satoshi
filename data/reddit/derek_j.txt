I do, as a matter of fact. Its quite successful. Even without accepting bitcoin.

Haha. 1 customer in millions spent $1000 with btc. Versus that other millions of customers who spent *billions*.
Why change, when the demand is so small? Overstock apparently picked up 2000 or so new customers when they started accepting it. 2000 customers wouldn't even be noticeable to amazon.

They're part of NATO. They must assist NATO operations.

Reddit will upvote and support anything that is anti-US.
That's completely ignoring the fact that it was led by the UK and France. The US had very little to do with Libya.

The US? You aren't very well informed, are you?
Libya was led by the UK and France. The US had very little to do with it.

Well if random guy on the internet claims it with no sources, it must be true.

The US contributes 72% of NATO costs, usually. The total cost of the operation was ~$4.5 billion. US contributed less that 25%

I love the vagueness and excuses.

Buy a gallon of milk with BTC. Tell me how much it costs you, and how long it takes.
You seem to want to think of BTC as a currency and as an investment, when it's terrible as both.

Yes, credit card transactions are instant. That's why if you swipe your card and have no money, it says declined. If you swipe your card and immediately look online at your bank, it will show the transaction. Where the fuck are you getting the idea that it's not?
To process transactions (slowly) Bitcoin uses more power than a small country. It requires better interfaces and infrastructure that no one can agree on and won't ever happen. Lightning has been just around the corner for how long?

Okay, then go buy a gallon of milk, tell me how much it costs and how long it takes.
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:25:05
Go buy a gallon of milk with your "superb currency".

BTC economists, everyone.

Funds are there nightly. They don't take days or weeks. They haven't for a decade. Do keep up.


Securing the network for people to buy and sell bitcoin. Not transact in bitcoin. Because it's not a currency. No one uses it as such. When you try to spend $3 and have to pay $12 in fees on it, it's not a currency.


What percentage of transactions are done with Lightning? Do tell.


Show me one. Show me a company that accepts it. And no, not some hole in the wall tech company.

I thought you guys were fighting the stigma that bitcoin is an investment and not a usable currency?
All this does is reinforce that. It's not a currency, its an investment.

This is so fucking dumb. Global debt to who? Itself? 
Then it doesn't count as debt.
