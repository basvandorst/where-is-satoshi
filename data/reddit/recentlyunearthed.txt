Damn it, I only have .999 btc, transaction fee when I moved to a more secure wallet...

At that price formerly unprofitable miners come back online and the difficulty jumps 27% that cycle.

Why do you buy a laptop when you know in two years you can get a much better one for much cheaper?

I'm looking to buy about 3 bitcoin. The price is high right now. Should I hold off a week or two? Dollar-cost-average?

Identity theft could be a thing of the past. A protocol like bitcoin can stop it. Now you give your debit card info on the net it's taken and stored in a not so perfectly secure server. By the thousands they can be stolen and sold on the black market and accounts can be emptied out or used for illegal purposes.
Why? Every Time you hand over your debit card info you have over the keys to the whole account and the merchant pulls out what you agreed to. Bitcoin is different you send out only what you want to send out and you never toss anyone the keys and hope for the best.
Personal finance guru Dave Ramsey say it nearly every episode, "Never Give a debt collector electronic access to your bank account (like you would your power company or phone company) because *they will empty it COMPLETELY* regardless of what terms you agreed to on the phone"
Why do we have a system where that's how we send money? We don't have to. Technology like this can LESSEN cybercrime.

We don't know the scope, It could have been less than 1% of the total. It's actually mathematically safer to have a small parts if a portfolio in some things that are high risk.

Very true. Dollars are really common outside the us. There are about as many outside as inside.

You can file any income legal or illegal on your taxes as "Miscellaneous" or "5th amendment" ordinary income. You cannot be forced to submit testimony against yourself so says the supreme court.

It's a steady 25 new coin every 10 minutes that is mined ( at least for another year or so). What is sold and what is held, I don't know.

That's how venture capital works you invest in 5 things with 20% chance of success and each with a more that 5:1 upside. One will work the rest will fail. (simplified example) even in this hyperbullish subreddit everyone says over and over don't risk what you can't lose.

 the laptop is the sandwich in this example. While the dollar is generally inflationary it isn't when it comes to laptops and flat screens because the technology betterments out paces the dollar inflations. It is "always" better to wait. You'll get more for your money if you do. But people don't, because they like things, and they like them now.

No chargebacks. Also You don't have to hold credit card information on a secure server. Payers don't risk their accounts/identity theft just to send a payment. Good luck.

I think there is more tomorrow.

What is basic security for the small scale user? Right now I use multibit and I have a very complicated password. Is that enough for someone who has no reason to be a big target?
