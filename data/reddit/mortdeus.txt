Russian Mail Order Bride. $10k is enough to get one of the young mid range hot ones right? 
I'm betting that after vesting over 10 years and after being properly aged to American standards you only find in a fine aged whisky...
I can resell her for twice the gold back after she can speak the language and then just swap her out for the younger hotter next gen model and do it all over again. 
Then one day I'll run for President and nobody will ever think twice about it because that will be the least of their worries.

How important is the registration to completing all the other task? The registration says that you don't have to actually participate in it to win. Is this true or not?

In bitcoin's defense, people only know what gold is because it's shiny.

You guys realize most people only vote once maybe twice, on anything period, for most of their lives unless they are extremely invested in the game aspect of politics OR they are getting to relive their prom or pagent days over and over again voting on the who's who, kings and queens, of Hollywood dreams that died farther away from a silver screen that the collective distance between you and all your viewers watching you dance on TV and trying to remember where they knew you from. 
In otherwards people don't vote, atleast not when it matters because of the fact that it matters so much being concerned with what's that that is the matter, that most people don't think their opinion really matters all that much, thus it gets relegated into a matter for people that actually matter. Preferably like the kind of people who study matter or try to talk you through about what is the matter with and/or matters most to you, so long as they don't have a heavy Irish accent and prounce "see how you were the matter out of the bunch" UNLESS, and bare with me because this is when things as a matter of fact really starts to boil down to the most quintessential thing that maters in this post... he ends it with a "jolly ho, my dear lad" So long. SO LONG... Just Hold. One more min, im about to bring this whole matter to a close... He doesn't pronounce the word matter obnoxiously wrong too like Irish people tend to do. 
And if he puts them both together being an Irish shrink might tend to do. 
"Kan yew see now hawl beeforwl yew wrrr matter thaaan awl hail but nawl that yew tawlked the mahtur owt in deh ohpen... aye kan sea Yer uh muhch betta mahn fore et. Jolly ho, my dear lad"
Then your just going to have to take matters into your own hands and put that sick dog down. If you know what matters... ��

"And the population is those who follow Ron Paul on Twitter. Not exactly a scientific sampling"
Considering the fact that the last time we even came close to electing somebody who was actually smart into office was way back when Ross Perot ran on a platform of "me, the teacher, paying so I can educate you, the student" as a 3rd party candidate, and America voted for the guy they'd rather have a beer with because it's more important to have a cool president than a geek president. I think everybody qualified as not only a scientific sampling but also as a collection of fascinating specimens.

you mean kinda like how they spied on every other emerging technology before ripping it off. (e.g. xerox's desktop, linux being unix, C++ taking over the market as an object oriented program, etc etc)

i like the lion king "circle of life" metaphor much better than the angry canadian's  explanation to the ageless question "why's life pointless?"
