These "DAE buy bitcoin before it was kewl??" posts are stupid and annoying. 
Nobody cares, stop discouraging newcomers.

Blockchain technology is a superior currency system than fiat because it can't be created and manipulated by governments. If all governments were perfectly competent with no corruption and had the people's best interest in mind, fiat would be fine. This is not the case in the real world. Blockchain tech is the currency of the future. The time may not be now and the victor may not be bitcoin, but crypto is here to stay.

Not really. Ver probably made millions in profit off BCH. The poor saps who believed his scam are the ones who got fucked.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:00:33
Except Bitcoin which is called Bitcoin.

Any estimates of how much us a B2X coin is going to be worth right after the fork? Thousands? Hundreds? Tens?
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:26:30
If fast cheap transactions were all that mattered in a cryptocurrency everyone would be using Litecoin. Bcash's only reason for success is scamming people into thinking it it Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:14:31
Most altcoins don't try to directly leech off the success of Bitcoin and even advertise that it itself IS bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:13:22
Bcash is deliberately trying to mislead people to to invest in it thinking it real bitcoin. 
I call it Bcash to avoid confusion, not to "troll" or whatever. Ver happens to dislike the name, but that's too bad. It is not Bitcoin so it shouldn't have Bitcoin in the name.
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:54:11
I guess what im still wondering is should I bother doing the coin splitting process so I can sell my B2X coins immediately or should I just not take any action. I mean I do want free money if theres no risk of me losing my BTC, but is it even worth it?
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:07:16
Sometimes I feel sorry for the people who thought BCash was legit. Then I remember they actually were dumb enough to trust this moron.

I did. It was pretty funny.

That's what I assume, but I'm wondering if its something all banks do?
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:18:51
Look I know this attitude is lame, but it shouldn't be called "Bitcoin"-anything since it is intentionally trying to trick people into buying it thinking it is Bitcoin. I'm not intentionally trying to piss off anyone by calling it bcash, I'm just trying to stop the spread of confusion that could lead new users into thinking bcash is Bitcoin.

I have to say... part of the reason a lot of people were conned by Ver is because of the heavy censorship on this sub. It really does make ot appear like this sub is the propaganda machine. People who knew better can see right through BCH, but newcomers werent as fortunate. I get that we want to keep the discussion on bitcoin and not talk about alts, but they had to pick between a side that has a reputation for silencing opposing thoughts and one that has open moderator logs. Thats why BCH is jam packed with noobies pretending they know what theyre talking about.
I think we should chill on the banning, just my opinion. Even if topics drift away from bitcoin are we really missing out on much if some of the "to the moon" memes are replaced by discussions and debates?
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:20:53
Also "Bitcoin Wallet" app which uses Bcash by default. I'm sure there is more. It is very intentional and the idea that BCash = Bitcoin needs to be stopped because Bcash supporters are doing everything they can to mislead people.
Edit: also this image  (from BITCOIN.com) which clearly tries to portray Bitcoin Cash as the original chain and the real Bitcoin an "alternate". My point it there are more reasons to highlighting that Bcash is not bitcoin than just being a troll.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:40:56
I agree with you that we shouldnt be petty and wage a "war" with bcash. Its unfortunate though that the CEOs of bcash are attempting to hijack the name "bitcoin" by using the site bitcoin.com and advertising bcash wallets as "bitcoin wallets". We should not be calling it "bitcoin cash" because it will confuse people into thinking it is bitcoin. It is not Bitcoin so it should have a seperate name.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:21:04
Then sell ur bitcoin to someone who can handle some variation without freaking out lol...
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:37:55
Sounds like a badass grandpa tbh.
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:15:39
Crypto is definitely going to be around in the future and probably will replace fiat eventually. 
That being said, you're crazy if you think the government won't step in and resist the change with everything they have before we get to the point where your average person is using it. There will be propaganda campaigns and probably laws that will make cryptocurrency use not worth the hassle. No they wont be able to take your bitcoin but they will make it near impossible to ever do anything with.
But until then to the moon.

Blockchain is more than an investment opportunity. The question is whether the world is ready for it.
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:17:15
Same lol. Was waiting for the dip at 7k but it never came. Should have just bought then :/

Really hoping for a pic from the ISS to pop up now...
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:10:12
Whoa check out this high roller.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:10:43
Idk. It seems like if 1BTC=7k and now becomes 1BTC=7k + 1B2X=7k, then an (untapped) bitcoin has suddenly doubled in value. Wheres this value coming from? Im planning to just hold on to my BTC and not risk splitting them wrong, but if we're talking a grand or more.. i need to start studying.
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:20:16
Hes right, and thats not bashing crypto at all. Thats just how government are, especially the US. They arent going to give up the power to control peoples assets without a fight. They cant sieze your bitcoin or anything but they will make it so hard to use that the value will hit a hard ceiling. What will happen from there I don't know. Crypto will eventually be currency of the future, but probably not in our lifetimes.

Bitcoin Gold isn't going to incredible lengths to trick people into thinking Bitcoin Gold is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:58:47
I just bought a lot at like 8.7k cause I got tired of waiting for the dip and didn't want to be left behind.
I have no fear because I know for a fact it will reach 9k. The world is not going to not let this meme happen.

Thanks mom

no thats equal to 9000

Calling it BCash removes the single thing that altcoin has going for it: "Bitcoin" in the name.
I understand why he's pissed. His master plan has been foiled.

Im pretty sure you can cancel those transactions and theres a delay before the money becomes available to the other party.
Not an expert though.

I should have bought more when it was still $5500 :(.

Sell when youre exchanging bitcoin for goods using your bitcoin debit card at Bitcoin General.

I'm confused about this. Can a webpage have code that can break out of the browser?
How can simply visiting a site and not downloading anything give you malware?
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:25:17
Im jealous. Bought most of mine at 4k and thought I was getting a great deal when it went down to 3600. Still wish I had bought more @ 3600 tho :(
