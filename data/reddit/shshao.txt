GBTC already exists, they'll try to get on NYSE or NASDAQ.

They've been calculating and publishing a daily bitcoin reference rate for a year, so they'll probably use that.

The way financial markets works with derivatives, is they're all related. Take for example stocks, stock index futures and options.  With the additional tools comes additional liquidity, and the markets function well, like an oiled machine.  Big changes, like the 2008 financial crisis, resolves itself as stock markets move quickly.  
By the way, the 2008 financial crisis was caused by mispricing mortgage derivatives through bundling.  That level of indirect financial products is just stupid.  One simple level of Bitcoin futures, especially when current bitcoin exchanges are inefficient, I have no problems with.
It's just like if you had a lot of Reebok shoes to sell, it never hurts to have additional stores selling them.  Customers are happy, Reebok is happy, everybody wins.

Bitcoin may be a bubble, but it's far from topping yet.  There's value in bitcoin and the overall crypto currency market, in the security, safety, freedom in exchange of value.  But there's simply not enough participation to be anywhere near a bubble. 
Bubbles are caused by the unnatural participation of crowds.  Like your plumber daytrade dot com stocks is unnatural.  A stripper owning multiple rental houses  is unnatural.
Home ownership rose from 63% to 69% at the peak of the housing bubble.  That's 12 million extra homeowners.  Is that natural?
During the dot com bubble, stock market participation peaked at 30% dropping to 18% from 2001.  The extra 12% represents 24 million people who should not have been in dot com stocks.  That's not natural.
So how many people are really in Bitcoins?  There are only 339,000 with wallets more than $10,000.  Sure there are lots of wallets, but hardly anybody's committed investment level of money.  So there's nothing unnatural yet.

I think it legitimizes bitcoin, in a way eliminates risk of irrelevance.

Reduced volatility doesn't change the eventual direction of any asset price.  The eventual price is always a function of supply and demand.  So I do think you can get to $1 million/coin by 2020 even with reduced volatility.
For example, if bitcoin rose by 0.5% per day, it can still get to $1 miilion/coin.  Whereas recently it's been gyrating up and down by 10% per day.  So you see there's plenty of room for volatility to decrease.

It's just so much cheaper to trade on CME. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:25:26
Yes definitely more secure, as CME has been handling large amounts for a long time, and not likely to get hacked.

Here's a FAQ from the CME.
I traded futures for many years, and the platform is much more mature than any bitcoin exchanges.  The means there can be a lot more volume, and it will be standardized.
Here are the implications:
1) Prices are standardized.  For example, When current bid on bitfinex or GDAX is 10,500 I can bid 10,500.01.  On CME, 1 contract is 5 BTC, so $50,000 contract goes up by $25 each increment.  So if the bid is $50,000, I can't bit $50,000.01, I can only bid $50,025.
2) Futures accounts are easy to open, trading is very cheap, and fund transfer is very easy.  Even the cheapest bitcoin exchanges charge 0.1% trading now, which is $100 per $100,000.  On the futures exchange, size doesn't matter, so I can trade $100,000 for $2 fees.  I'm trading on CME instead of bitfinex for sure.
3) The majority of trading volume will end up on the CME, because major traders already have futures accounts.  This has happened in the past, for everything from cattle futures to gold.  I predict only bitfinex or other large bitcoin exchanges will survive in a few years, as their volumes will decrease.
4) Trades are made and positions are taken as a derivative of the underlying, meaning no actual BTC changes hands.  It is for delivery in the future.  So there will be March, June, Sep, Dec deliveries, and each contract can trade different prices.  This is a way for futures trader to set a price in the future.
5) They only trade BTC against USD.  Again, standardization means CME doesn't have to worry about BTC/EUR, BTC/GBP etc.  Again, all big brokerages will allow customers to trade futures with any currency (EUR, GBP) deposit, since futures contracts are just bets to be settled at a later date and no real money changes hands at the time of the trade.
6) Volatility should decline.  With increased volume from big players with actual future plans for the currency.. Also, Circuit breakers in place will stop trading for a period of time to reduce volatility. Academic studies are mixed on whether listing futures exchanges actually lower volatility.
7) Trading hours closes everyday from 4pm to 5pm.  So not really 24 hours like current bitcoin exchanges, but close.
8) Margins are expected to be about 35%.  So since 1 contract is 5BTC, valued at $50,000, you'll need $17,500 on deposit just to trade 1 contract.

My old stat gets outdated quickly as prices skyrocketing... 
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:58:04
That's not statistics.  You have to count up the total participation, and there's not much.

I wouldn't want to own Bitcoin, I just want to ride the wave of speculation into the potential of crypto currencies.  Bitcoin may not even be the medium of exchange in the long-term, as ETH or BCH may be better.  Futures is just a way to speculate on that wave.

You just need cash to trade futures as a retail client.

It's an online platform man. You don't plan just for 5 people, even if only 5 showed up yesterday.

It's called an uptrend. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:20:22
Another way to look at it, fiat currencies lost that much value, so no big deal... 
@_date: 2018-11-27 05:32:18
Awesome!

Technically, it's gotta rise to be a bull methinks. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:24:02
It's on track. It's going down. Some call it the trend.

Returning to mean for bitcoin market doesn't mean much... The market is nuts

Bitcoin as a brand name is scarce. But anybody can create a token anytime. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:08:49
Trust me. You did well to stay with small positions. Except in trading, never say or think the word "shoulda" 
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:10:07
That will happen, but never starting from where you bought, when you bought. Never.
