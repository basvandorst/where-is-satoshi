You mentioned Coinbase, why don't you do what most people do with it?  That is to say buy directly on Coinbase itself, then do the free transfer to GDAX or now known as pro.coinbase.com and simply send it to your hardware wallet or other destination?

I bought a bit more just now... HoDL fam

Thanks for the information, truly a great person in our community
@_date: 2019-07-24 21:12:43
Because of DOXXING for real life information if and when BTC hits 100,000 USD or whatever.  You do not potentially want someone knowing your a millionaire.

Just looked at more of her artwork and wow. This is fantastic. Going to send some BTC her way ��
@_date: 2019-07-19 00:38:14
I just read up on him and wow I'm certainly not surprised as he worked as an investment banker for almost two decades.  His third wife used to live in a Castle and he has over 300 million net worth plus cash in off shore accounts!  But hey let's make sure we aren't laundering money or anything

@_date: 2019-02-26 02:51:01
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:26:32
You could also do 3, or 4k increments or 2k increments on dips as well?  kind of a hybrid version of dollar cost averaging.  Or like coinsmash1 said, after dips.  Technically we are still up for the year, but we are on a 20% dip from the past 10 days or so.  Then make sure you have a hardware wallet  and HODL!!!
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:41:26
What if i want to play xbox all day?  Or better yet while im working from home?  I feel like a piece of shit after 10 hour session but god dam was it a good day

And hes now sueing for Libel and slander for people who based his "reputation" LMAO hes trying to sue Vitalik and Roger ver among others for saying hes not Satoshi.  WOW what  a fucking CLOWN SHOE.  FUCK YOU CRAIG YOU FAKE POS

@_date: 2019-06-27 18:19:03
Or get more!?!?!
@_date: 2019-06-03 20:26:06
This makes me feel so much more confident that Craig is a fucking clownshoe.  Look at this from one of the evidence docs on the courtlistener site for his case with Klein.
 
Clearly this email purporting to show Dave appointing Uyen as a “director” of W&amp;K is a forgery. Dave neverappointed Uyen to be a director in any  company.  In fact, Uyen told  Ira via email that she knew nothing about Dave. (Ex. 11, KLEIMAN\_00004796.)Butafter being caught 11lying to this Court for the fourth time,4he withdrew the exhibit under the pretense of yet a fifthlie, that he couldn’t verify the date he’d drafted and sent the forgery. (ECF No. 154).B.Without the fraudulent email, the entire motion falls.When Craig withdrew the fake email as an exhibit, he stated that he was nevertheless “not withdrawing the motion and maintains that this Court  lacks subject-matter  jurisdiction  over this action.”(Id.at  1-2.)However,  without  this  exhibit,  there  is  no  evidence  that  Uyen  was  ever authorized to act for W&amp;K and file the 2014 Sunbiz filing. In which case, Craig has nothingat all to support his contention that Uyen’s 2014 Sunbiz filingwas legitimate
@_date: 2019-02-24 16:29:59
Seriously this is odd more bizarre than usual. I thought my price indexer was fucking broken. Literally was 4100 a few minutes ago then I see it at $3750

Nothing like a small come Bender with your closest pals. Up till 5am tweaking �� as soon as the bag is empty, panic sets in!!
@_date: 2019-06-30 15:24:49
Dude I think personally if he had 10k BTC to spend on a couple pizzas, he clearly mined or bought several thousands more
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:52:08

Dam man, i see so many of these.  Hey can you help me withdraw my 2 BTC from so and so shit site?   You can get 10%
Such a brutal time but totally understanding.  Being able to potentially take 1,000USD from someone anywhere in the world has its merit
@_date: 2019-04-17 18:33:04

@_date: 2019-09-24 19:14:07
inb4 the 9k memes again.. fuck man, im buying more now, wife gonna be pissed LOL
@_date: 2019-09-27 18:00:50
Dam some people are the expected trolls and bashers of everything BTC.  Sad because i have seen some really great conversations here and there are some excellent minds too.  I am not a maximalist but i do only own BTC so it is what it is lol
@_date: 2019-09-24 21:19:30
Yeah I haven't taken much for profit at all. Only sold 0.1 at 12k but I've since purchased more at varying prices. But I just don't want to see more bloodshed even though I am in it for long haul.  Just hindsight and fomo make it painful to watch daily charts ��
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:15:43
7200 seems ugly AF to me personally even tho i got in mostly at \~4200, i think it has to do with me mentally seeing 13k thinking wow im a smart buyer. now i bought some more at 8150.. so will see i guess
@_date: 2019-09-27 16:04:32
LOL love it

Hmm this gives me a devious idea...that I'll pussy out and never actually do ��
@_date: 2019-05-17 18:57:50
This is why I bought my first Ledger Nano S and absolutely LOVE it.  Have had fantastic luck and i love the logging, i was looking back last few months when i was doing the majority of my BTC accumulation and my timing was incredible, super happy to see it in writing!
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:50:44
I started my accumulation in February this year, finished my last buy in recently but previously was near the end of march.  Feeling happy with my average :D
@_date: 2019-05-12 11:45:48
Oh baby we at $7,250 right now!

@_date: 2019-05-15 13:03:00
quick the price is 8008.5
@_date: 2019-05-17 19:54:29
It was supposed to be a Dollar backed coin, aka derives its value from 1.00 US dollar.  however they only have about 70% backed or less at this point.  look up stable coins for more details :)
@_date: 2019-05-29 14:40:33
Thank you i have been wondering why the fuck hes doing this, but obviously hes a fucking troll looking to make more money and pump his shitcoin, cheers ;)

Honestly bro, I'm on the fence for Bcash. I sold my last one for more BTC last week, but I always say to myself is having one BCH worth a 400$ lottery ticket if it does go back to 3k or more? Perhaps
