Now imagine if we could do that with our tax payments... encoding our tax payments to be spent how we want them to be spent.  Probably won't be allowed but imagine the power shift.

Newly implemented tax on something that was never taxed before.... and it's retroactive.

If the main value in Bitcoin is in it's concept of being able to exchange value between two different people, two different places in the world, at any time, and the technical innovation this brings to the financial system, then where does that leave the rest of this article talking about Bitcoin as if it's main feature is a nongovernmental money?

Absolutely agree with the OP.  Guys, if all you have to say is f this or f that, you've wasted my time but more importantly you've wasted your own.  
I enjoy posts here but only those of value.   Hoping this community could be the authoritative source for all things Bitcoin that attracts people to keep coming back rather than wondering why they are wasting time here reading nothing of value.

Well that is exactly why this will be a good example of what can be done.  We're finding out right now.  The community is doing the detective work.  What you propose would be more appropriate if the US controlled Bitcoin but since that's not the case, everyone can only work on the edges of it.  What recourse the Mt. Gox victims get is yet to be determined by the work of the community.
We'll see what happens and it's an interesting experiment.  The work of the community is motivated by their own losses regardless of geopolitics.

She kept drilling you with a tone of "how could you!"
She obviously did not understand the technology as a protocol, a method of transfer, but rather as an investment, a currency on it's own.
I think until you use Bitcoin and experience the ease of transactions with it, it's hard to understand what it is exactly.  I think many had the same experience with the internet.  Yes you can search for information, but you can send information instantly, you can collaborate in real time and any time of any day.  People need to go through the motions of using this technology.
I almost want to say there should be bitcoin shops like apple stores.  I'm not advocating or promoting apple products in any way here but their stores are a great playground to test the product they offer, to be shown what's possible with the technology, not just their products but the technologies and protocols their products make use of.  And then each individual can decide if the product is right for them but they also walk away knowing and having seen what can be done with the protocols out there.
Edit: Another idea... maybe even a small, and smartly organized convention for industry professionals and those really knowledable with the bitcoin technology and products out there than can utilize it to show invited media how it can be used.  Really hate to say this next line but... kinda like an Apple event. DOH!

This assumes he would know what goes into bitcoin mining and what it requires.

The media would pick up on such an AMA.  They'll be looking for any reasons and responses from trolls to help discredit Bitcoin.  I'd hope everyone remains professional in such a thread.  Keep the discussion on topic and don't give into giving the community a bad rep.  If something is said that makes your blood boil... Save it for somewhere else.

What if voice biometric capabilities could be added into bitcoin? You would be able to hear and speak the details and your own unique biometrics would be a layer of security.
@_date: 2014-03-01 14:18:07
This could be a good example for law enforcement that Bitcoin transactions are not as anonymous as the media portrays and a trail can be uncovered without any additional features or policies added.  I think as criminals find out about this too, they will be less inclined to use Bitcoin vs cash.

IMHO the man is a genius.  Look at us... we're all talking about him.  I bet this is exactly what he wanted.
@_date: 2014-03-02 00:18:00
Well that is one of the concerns many speak of when criticizing bitcoin, that transactions are anonymous and facilitate illegal activity.
You could argue that Bitcoin has been involved with real crimes.
This is not about law enforcement trying to recover your funds.  That may happen as a result of law enforcement using Bitcoin to follow to trail of bitcoins that were used in "real crimes."
If only people knew of the possible digital forensics that can be performed, they might realize Bitcoin is superior to cash in protecting your privacy to a point while at the same time improving the transfer of value processes.

I feel many, me included, still have a lot to learn about Bitcoin.  I just started seeing the value and future of Bitcoin a few weeks ago.  Only after reading more on the inner workings of the system do I see it's potential superiority of a currency if only everyone in the world used it.  It's still young and has problems to overcome: where to obtain it for the uneducated, where to learn about it, how to secure it.  I think for the mainstream it's still beyond the complexity that most people want to bother with.  I do see 3rd party companies working on creating enhancements that will increase simplicity and security.  Simplifying the explanation and building up the security will be needed.

Really a great post and overall a great debate by both sides.  All the flaws and benefits need to be vetted.  A lot of people are just uncertain with this new technology and concept.  "There must be a catch!" And if there isn't a catch now, there's probably one coming... attempted regulations, taxes, denial of access or making access to the network more difficult that people say it's not worth it?
Just like "small business Saturday," the community can choose to do more business with Bitcoin accepting businesses and merchants.
As Bitcoin grows more popular... I feel there will be a showdown brewing with either central banking authorities or private banking institutions.  This might become complex to tax and also cut into traditional banking business, wouldn't it?
Either way innovation in the financial system is happening, should be a good show.

The only people I'd expect him to be loyal to would be his clients who pay him his management fees.  If I was him, I would would see all of us and strings to be played.
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:53:13
I appreciate the response but I don't think one word of that answered my question.
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:34:35
Does Bitcoin make this transaction less sketchy?
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:59:25
It helps in thinking of solutions to it's flaws as well.  It's not well understood and it takes a good deal of effort to try to understand it.  I had to read several paragraphs and posts over to be sure I caught them correctly.
This conversation is exactly the kind that needs to be kicked to center stage.

Cab drivers... I'm interested in hearing why you accept bitcoin! Lower transactions costs? Is it simpler for you?  What's the value in it for you?  Just want to get your specific industry take on this payment system.
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:16:48
Does is the bitcoin rate constantly changing with the price?  Do they as for 0.0125 bitcoins or $20 worth of bitcoin?  If asking for a USD amount of bitcoin, then the driver is exposing himself to exchange rate risk too, and with the volatility, could be worse than the fee from CC's.  Interesting though!

Would gladly accept any gold if any is still or becomes available!  Looks like I was late for the party, just searching from some crumbs now!
@_date: 2013-11-30 15:19:05
That's useful for future transactions but how do we make the person who just got robbed whole again?
For instance, a bank/credit card company might return the funds to you (their money) while they investigate the situation and they offer to cover legal action and collections is on them.
Here with bitcoin there's no middle man so it's riskier.  The one time scammer will just hit and run.  Future ratings won't matter.
Will that just be the inherent risk with digital currencies?
Something to ponder...
Edit: should governments start regulating this... would the electronic trail be a lead to follow for prosecution?  Or would an app like Tor and it's equivalents make it difficult?
