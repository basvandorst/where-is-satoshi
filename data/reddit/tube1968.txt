If that was true we will see a huge rise in bitcoin price when Mt.Gox finally shuts down.

Conclusion is: inside Mt. Gox were much more coins (GoxCoins) in circulation than in real world.  This means the price on Gox was way too low. Even when it was around 1000 dollars. And there was never any theft of real bitcoins. The 750,000 "missing" coins are just these coins created inside Gox.

Can we be sure there was only $5M seized as stated in the public? Couldn't it be much more? Maybe $50M or more?

Could you also build a trading engine? Just for nostalgia.

I had 1 BTC in Mt.Gox when they disabled withdrawals. Sold it, bought it back a few times in the last weeks, and ended up with 1.5 BTC yesterday.
