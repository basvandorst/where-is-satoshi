It's quite simple, import your private keys that held the bitcoin prior to the fork into a Bitcoin Cash wallet, like Electron Cash. Then move those coins just like you would bitcoin, minus the high fee :P

How did we do it before the exchanges lol, word of mouth, Bitcoin meet ups, local Bitcoins. It's not that hard to find people to buy from or sell too

Just out of curiosity, what's the benefit of a core node versus an updated protocol node? 
@_date: 2017-03-26 06:22:10
You have to atleast try on chain scaling to say it doesn't work.

please don't dump it all and make bitcoin crash. Sell it slowly, invest it in mining a higher blocksize. Be smart.

Very clever way to get a ton more followers in the Bitcoin community

Neither classic nor Unlimited were attacks, just other groups of promoting other ways to move the Bitcoin network forward. Just because one group holds the majority of power doesn't mean they are always right. I'm not again 2nd level network, but ignoring the fact that fees are rising is not what I consider smart. 
That's why I support Bitcoin Cash and consider it the real Bitcoin right now. I remember BTC when it was just a few cents per tx, that's why I loved it. Now, I can't use it to buy coffee or anything without paying a fee over a dollar.

It's a fork of the original chain, not a completely different coin. I consider Litecoin, Ethereum, Monero Alt coins. 
If it originated from the original Bitcoin chain it isn't an alt coin. It's a different version that comes from my original transaction history I made from when I got in.
I would consider Bitcoin a combination of all the chains together (Core, Cash, Gold etc) and their combined values

Oh wasn't aware of that :p, I thought it had a separate blockchain genesys block
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:22:15
But see this is what I mean. It shouldn't be considered an alt coin, the same way that btc shouldn't be considered an alt coin. Both have their benefits and downsides. I'm just more for educating new users on both options.

Even if we did that, eventually a superior chain will be a clear winner. If creating 5 chain splits means that in the end we will have a better chain then I am all for it
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:26:52
Ethereum doesn't try to be Bitcoin. It is fundamentally a different tech. I'm considering anything that originated on and from the original Bitcoin chain. Hell Bitcoin Gold can join this as well, I am fundamentally against the way they handled their fork, but even then in the spirit of the coins they should still be given fair say

Basically, and for r/btc don't be so hard on Core

I disagree, it's only gotten stronger in the last few months and is slowly getting more and more support. I think it's wiser to be aware of where it is going and have a hand in both pots juuuust in care die hard Core proponents were wrong. It's why I'm invested in both communities.

I didn't remove that thread as I don't have any privileges on r BTC, also don't know how that thread is in any way relevant to what I'm trying to ask. I'm genuinely curious what people on this side of the wall are thinking / saying about the upcoming possible hard fork. That's all I'm trying to get from this post. It's true that I lean more to r btc support but I still want to get everyone's opinion so I can properly formulate my own.

Can you elaborate on this? What makes you thing this is a push to take control? Just trying to get some healthy discussion here. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 03:14:16
Sorry if I was irrational in my question. Hey fellow Bitcoin users? :p
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:58:37
Miners are incentivized to follow the money, if all the money goes to one or the other then it makes sense that's where the miners go there as well. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:35:38
It's fair
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:50:10
Who knows, if there was a simple answer we wouldn't have a blocksize debate still going 3 years down
@_date: 2016-07-31 00:47:15
I'm yet to get an explanation though. Even if it originally wasn't on the table shouldn't we be community driven? A fairly large amount of bitcoin users (I'm speaking for communities I met in Australia USA and Japan) all seem to be for a block size increase.
@_date: 2016-07-30 11:23:55
But why should they not be on the table, the fees are so high now, and all bitcoin users around I meet want a bigger blocksize, how is it not on the table?
