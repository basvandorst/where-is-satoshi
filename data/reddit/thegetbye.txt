From my limited understanding, it requires downloading a PDF onto a USB with 2 QR codes. Then running transactions through the Blockchain Wallet app.

Hmmm.. so if you just need the private key does that mean that Ledger has some limited access/exposure to my bitcoin?

How bout a cool band? We are called The Getbye.  We are a gypsy rock band from Orlando, FL. We would use the funds to help scale us to the mid-national level. We play some pretty cool festivals like Hulaween and Backwoods but show up without proper gear like digital PA, in-ear monitors, proper chloe pickups. Im in control of our band reddit page but mostly just lurk here and the Bucs page. Id have to set up a bitcoin account for the band. But I would ;)

This is more of a taxes question. Most of my bitcoin  I bought on coinbase and am hodling long term. But I recently learned about GDAX and how you can get zero transaction fees there. So Im thinking of taking a small amount and doing some day trading. Do you have to pay capital gains everytime you sell whatever amount of bitcoin even if I plan on rebuying in a handful of hours?

Yea I hear ya.  But we're going to the moon here.  If I just give him cash he'll blow it and miss out on all these sweet gains. But I guess that's his prerogative.

Seriously, it's been almost an hour. I have no idea how to feel. I'm just gonna assume anger and go from there.

I'm with you. I've seen countless times people saying you can only use an address once because its exposed after that. I dont get it.  I've never moved funds strictly out of fear of losing everything.

My countertops are the same granite. It's good cause it hides crumbs and spills well. It's bad cause it hides crumbs and spills well.
