Is Gemini up?  CMC has their price at 14.7k but who knows, I'm not set up with them.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:38:03
Cool, thanks for the info.  Looks like I should have been less lazy and completed my registration there.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:02:45
Wew is especially delusional today.  How many "flippening" and "Bitcoin is dead" parties can you have that only last an hour or so?  I'm honestly pretty shocked at how well Bitcoin absorbed the BCash blitzkrieg today.  A couple of hours later and it's like nothing has happened (except an inflated BCash price).  Every failed attack just makes Bitcoin stronger.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:33:45
I just meant it was priced at ~10% over Gemini at the time.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:59:01
Just switched yesterday. Coinbase finally approved my daily withdrawal limit today (lol) but fuck them. This is how a free market works, actions have consequences.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:14:52
With all of the new users the next dip/panic sell is going to be crazy, lol.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:55:57
I've been watching everything almost nonstop for months. Little dip in that we're fucking up still from yesterday (and ridiculously up this week) so it's not even significant. It's only a dip from the full retard push we had this morning.  I guess I don't understand your confusion? Plz help
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:40:30


You could deposit the money to Coinbase/gdax and then buy in gdax once it clears.  They do have a minimum but I don't recall off the top of my head what it is.  Save to the minimum -&gt; deposit -&gt; buy = no fees
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:50:06
My friend (who has no BTC because "it's stupid") was over during the BCash pump when we dropped from $7200 or whatever to down around $5400 in like an hour. He was saying how I should just get out while I was ahead. So I hopped on my Coinbase app and bought more at $5400 (no funds in gdax plus it was easy and I was drunk).  He still has no Bitcoin.  But another friend jumped in around $10k and is very happy he listened to me, lol.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:30:58
Take a second to check out [this post]( regarding a senate bill working to throw a wrench in crypto.  Something to do while we wait for gdax to come back online. :)

Hello fellow Bitcoin hoardler.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:55:17
tl;dr  It looks like you ate the transaction (miner) fee
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:36:43
It will likely take hours for gdax to even start the transaction right now.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:53:51
Dip? We're literally up from yesterday morning, lmao.  If this causes you to panic you're gonna have a bad time in crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:42:35
Time to see what everyone is made of, lol.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:37:00
I would back them solely for standing by BTC during the first BCash attack in November (it was more profittable for a brief time to mine BCash but they stayed with BTC).  I'm still on the fence for pulling the trigger on ASIC mining, but if I do the pool I join will be based on ethics (I'd personally be mining more for contributing/decentralizing hash power than for straight greed/$$).
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:18:22
Lol. I wonder what market cap Bitcoin will have to achieve to get a taxpayer bailout if there's a significant dip? I mean we're already approaching "too big to fail" status based on the precedent set in 2008. I'm joking of course, but hopefully in the coming stock market and real estate crash (~2019/20 imo) they don't get bailed out again, and folks really start transferring their assets to Bitcoin/crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:04:56

I was unaware that Expedia accepted Bitcoin...the idea of taking a trip on my Bitcoin earnings is pretty damn pleasant.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:23:48
But the shills are saying fees are $50 and transactions take weeks!  They wouldn't be misleading, would they?! I wonder if the more frequent LN news is causing them to ramp up the FUD (time is running out BCash lads).
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:01:54
What a sad, bitter collection of people. Also the irony of all the "Bitcoin has no value" comments is pretty cringeworthy.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:55:00
That's true but I didn't have any USD in my Coinbase wallet (I transfer all to gdax and buy there).  They've been doing instant buys (with bank/ACH purchase) on Coinbase for about a month or so, but I'm not sure how they decide who gets the instant buy vs having to wait ~5-8 days.  It's also strange because it seems random for me as well, but it's a very small sample size.  But anyway I'm going to be switching to Gemini once I run out of my current gdax funds as I'm not a fan of how Coinbase is handling segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:03:56
Make that $14,000...
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:24:27
Coinbase/gdax not letting me buy...  (I don't have funds in Gemini yet and am out of town)

I'd really like one more sale below $10k, personally.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:04:44
**PSA: BCash is NOT priced at $8500 right now**, it's going at $3500-3800 on other exchanges.  This was a coordinated pump which included collusion between Coinbase/gdax and the BCash leaders (IMO, based on the explosion right at the release which was not reflected anywhere else).  Absolutely fucking unforgivable by Coinbase/gdax, fuck them.  It's pretty much what I expect from BCash so no surprise there.
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:17:18
This shit is bananas.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:19:32
I'm going to be switching to Gemini for my primary USD-crypto entry point. At this point it seems Coinbase is deliberately delaying segwit (the motive is debatable, but it's clear it is deliberate imo).   I'll also spread the word to all of the people I got into crypto to do the same. Coinbase can either abandon their agenda and do what their customers want or start to lose their market share, free market in action. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:28:23
Well I agree you should pay your taxes (cap gains or regular income if less than 1 year) so the IRS doesn't come after you...but the government is going to be coming after crypto no matter what.  
Banks are gonna have a bad time so they'll pay their lobbyists to pay their politicians to do what they can to crush it.  I saw there was a senate bill in the works now to fuck things up (over in edit - crossposted from [here's the post](
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:58:22
I see you completely missed the point of the post, lol.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:55:21
It's how I first heard about it and then waited ~3 years to do anything about it, lol.  Still, I probably wouldn't be in now if not for Andreas' appearances on JRE.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:55:25
Lol, ironically Coinbase finally approved my withdrawal limit to $50k today after over a month waiting. Too bad I'm using Gemini now, get fucked Coinbase/gdax.  Although to be honest the $500 daily deposit limit for Gemini is a huge negative for me, hoping to get that pushed significantly.  I wonder if Coinbase is doing damage control to retain traders.  I fucking hope so (fuck them).
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:49:19
I wonder if this dip is from all the former Coinbase users waiting to get verified at Gemini, lol.  Hopefully they're working OT over there to clear out the bottleneck.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:35:55
Sold mine about a week ago (finally, lol) for ICX, no ragrats.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:00:54
This is really challenging to deal with...I'm not sure how much I want to allocate to this dip but I just keep buying.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:23:57
Coinbase is great for noobs as it's so easy to use, it's a great starting point.  But beyond that you can make bank purchases, which is really nice.  I still use Coinbase when my gdax funds are depleted and I want to buy.  I have been stuck in the 5-7 business day waiting period too many times and missed gains when I could have just eaten the 2% fee and been on my way.  I also like it because there's an app for my phone so when I'm drinking and/or out I can just grab some whenever the fuck I want.  2% is a lot, but when BTC is moving like it has been it's negligible.
As for selling, I wouldn't know as I've never sold. :D

I appreciated the opportunity to buy back in the $13,000's, thanks everyone!
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:11:29
Absolutely, they're probably going to be swamped with new users.  How could you stay with Coinbase/gdax after this?

I wasn't planning on buying more Bitcoin with this batch of funds but the sale is making it tempting..
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:57:16
My initial post was aimed toward the "haha Bitcoin is gonna fail, I told you!!!" people, not the "we're due for a correction" people.  Because I was one of those people, lol.  Here's a post I made right before the dip:
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:29:12
Indeed I did. I wasn't planning on buying Bitcoin with my latest cleared deposit (been going hard on alts the past couple of weeks) so it's all good. But I can't resist a good sale so if it hit $17.6k I would have picked some up.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:56:25
This 10% "fee" for using gdax over Gemini right now is rustling me.

@_date: 2017-12-22 07:29:25
I'm also loving ETH at this price.
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:38:25
Yeah it hit $16k quite a few times today.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:39:42
And all of those "haha I told you bitcoin was dead" people will be back in here, talking shit while I buy up all of the sales.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:14:40
BCash down to around $3300 and BTC back to $17300, I wonder if ironically gdax's servers fucked up their plan.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:17:01
F5 you savage.
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:33:04
Lol, I'm not sure if you're a noob who is genuinely confused or are talking shit.  Either way it was priced in the low $18's and dropping when I made the post, I was planning on putting my latest batch of funds to alts but at $17.6k I would have picked up some Bitcoin too. Hope this helps.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:26:03
So far Bitcoin has gone up about 30% since the announcement.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:19:49
I'm going to guess that most of Coinbase's users (not gdax, but just Coinbase) don't know what Segwit is.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:17:33
Do you accept Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:01:21

@_date: 2017-12-09 01:25:00
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:31:46
I think the BCash attack on 11/11 took it down from about $7200 to $5400 which is ~33%.  My top number could be off, 3 weeks is like 3 years in Bitcoin time.  I only know the $5400 because I was drinking when it happened and I remember yolo'ing at $5400 on Coinbase, eating the 2% fee and all.  No ragrats.  And the 19 to 15 is a bit misleading as it was only at 19(.5) for seconds basically and only down to 15 again briefly (at least on gdax).  Plus we're still up 50% on the week, lol.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:08:42
We're still up ~65% on the month (priced in mid 13's).
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:51:54
They spelled "everyone" and "BCash" wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:12:39
Interesting, now people are panicking because Bitcoin has been stable over the past hour or so.

Damn son, quite the spike at opening of futures. This should be fun.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:55:27
Usually, unless I'm buying a small amount and the 0.25% is negligible.  Gdax was priced at ~$16500 while Gemini was at ~$15000, that's what I meant by "fee".
Edit - I haven't *sold* on gdax
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:02:25


I have a hard time believing it's not satirical at this point, the levels of delusion over there are insane.  I know is far from perfect but holy shit is completely off in its own world, completely devoid of any objective reasoning.

Oh nice, I will take a look at this after I spend the day pretending to work.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:57:09
I believe the fees are 4.5% for CC (stated 4% + 0.5% over gdax) and 2% for ACH transfer (stated 1.5% + 0.5% over gdax).  I haven't used a CC there in forever and only use Coinbase/ACH when I don't have any funds cleared and I want to buy something.  A few of my ACH buys have been instant lately though, which is nice.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:33:07
I wish he would actually dump all of his Bitcoin for BCash so he can go down with that ship and just go away, he's become completely toxic to the space.  Unfortunately I have a feeling he'll have ended up with more Bitcoin after the whole thing (at the expense of his followers).
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:23:21
Finally, a daily discussion thread!  Let's keep these going!  What a fucking morning, I've decided to just ride it out since gdax is having a seizure and the buy/sells keep flipping from 14k to 18k and nothing will go through.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:00:30
Here's a tweet from him *a year ago* saying that we should come together and move forward as an industry by implementing segwit:
The delay was intentional (imo) to give BCash more time gain market share before it's rendered useless (by segwit, LN, and other upcoming tech).  Coinbase utilizing segwit would have had a significant effect on the networks transaction times/fees.
Remember, his story up until recently was "uh, the users aren't asking for it" when people repeatedly asked him why the fuck Coinbase wasn't using segwit.

BCash sold out its decentralization in favor of a short term/sighted solution to scaling (and more significantly to make a few people very rich).  This is pretty transparent but if you try to tell that they'll say "hurrr the white paper PEER TO PEER CASH, stop CENSORING ME REEEEEE".  BCash is a cancer to the crypto community, I just hope reason prevails but this is far from a reasonable market right now.  People are buying Bitcoin Gold right now so lol who fucking knows?
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:22:52
I use "BCash" primarily to prevent confusion for newbies (I have had several people IRL ask me which coin is which, which of course is BCash's greatest asset).  That brings me to point  I also use "BCash" because I'm rustled that they went from being "a Bitcoin alternative" to openly attacking Bitcoin and calling itself "the real Bitcoin" *immediately* after their 2x proposal failed miserably.
The idea that BCash is going to be some superior payment system is a joke.  All they have is the confusion with the Bitcoin name.  If they weren't called "Bitcoin Cash" they'd be up against newer, superior tech and would get smoked.  BCash literally has nothing useful/unique except the (stolen) name.  I'm shocked that people are still buying it and it's one of the reasons I'm getting more and more concerned about the crypto bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:41:09
Damn, that's amazing. I wish I could buy it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:36:07

@_date: 2017-12-22 03:04:50
Apparently not, I'm guessing it's mostly the people who were asking "how do I buy a Bitcoin and get 30% gains a week?" two weeks ago who are now shitting themselves.
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:36:39
I know man, it's rough only being up 62.5% for the month.  Please do share more of your wisdom, you obviously know what you're talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:45:10
Lol, what's with all the panic in here? I bought some more at $16k today and couldn't give any less fucks about this little dip, I'm actually happy about it as the jump today from 15k to 19k was completely ridiculous.  Dropping back down to 15k (or even 11-12k) is fine.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:35:30
What's the current price?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:49:47
gdax back up, WWWEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:09:13
A U.S. based company as large as Coinbase should not be able to get away with this shit, and it's painfully obvious what's going on (also consider them delaying segwit and launching BCH trading two days after a BTC difficulty change along with a weak FUD campaign "uh BCash proponent and co-founder of Bitcoin.com says Bitcoin is bad!").  I'm pulling my funds from gdax/Coinbase tonight.
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:14:39
Hopefully we'll be able to bask in their tears (of missing out) and not get railroaded by their old money (lobbyists pulling their politicians' strings to ban crypto because of "terror...freedom...protect the children").  I have money in the stock market as well of course and like both but the *extreme* hatred for Bitcoin/crypto from Wall Street and banks is real and is only getting stronger.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:38:01
Yeah, standard BCash operating procedure.  They had me going for a second there (and I'm sure it's not over).
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:52:47
I buy coins/tech that I believe in and I generally hold them instead of trying to time the market (I do time it with buys).  I did buy and sell a bit yesterday, but that was just because it was so volatile that it was hard to resist.  Most of my BTC was bought before $5k, since then I just buy hard on dips. Also ~80% of my investments over the past month has been in alts, and even at current prices I'm doing very well there as well.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:08:17
For new accounts? I actually stated the sign up process a few months ago but just submitted my final docs yesterday. What about the daily deposit limit? Any chance of getting that upped?
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:21:52
BitMEX is also going to be dumping an ungodly amount of BCash (for Bitcoin too, lol), but I'm not sure when that's happening. I actually haven't heard anything on that in a while...
Regardless of people being able to dump *the* shitcoin once we can get more segwit adoption and LN up and running BCash is done.  Ver and can only sell each other BCash for so long.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:00:10
They're making a last push now as they circle the toilet, once LN is ready they will be flushed.  Only question is if they want to get out now and still have made some $$ (assuming they didn't buy in) or want to be in the group left holding the bag when Ver &amp; Co cash out to start their next shitcoin.

I was already on my way out after the bullshit delay on segwit, but today's actions were unforgivable imo.  I'm headed to Gemini for my USD-&gt;crypto entry point and will be taking my social/crypto circle with me.  I'm also telling folks to make sure to pull their assets from gdax/Coinbase as quick as possible, I seriously doubt there will be legal repercussions but if so you don't want to have your shit locked up there.

@_date: 2017-12-19 19:37:22
With that amount I'd just go with ETH or BTC and HODL.  Or you can get in on one of reddit's alts of the week and try to 4x it quickly and then buy ETH/BTC with that (lol).  But seriously I'd just get ETH and/or BTC and then start learning everything you can about crypto.  With skin in the game you'll want to learn all you can!

I don't think there's anything *wrong* with being extremely conservative (i.e. pay off mortgage despite 3.XX% interest rates) but I agree it's not the most effective course of action with the goal of maximizing gains.  As long as you are using debt effectively/intentionally (leveraging it in a low rate mortgage for example) there is nothing wrong with debt.
That said I have about 60% equity in my home and am not going to be cashing out to invest in crypto or stocks.  Crypto is too volatile (*imo*) and I think the stock market (and housing market) are both overdue for a correction (guessing within the next ~2-3 years, but who knows).

I was going to buy an S9 to help out but Bitmain is obviously team BCash (to the point the next run can only be bought with BCash). Considering trying to get in at the next pump and dump, leave them holding the bag. Only problem is when my payment is 1/2 the value of what it was when I sent it the day before, they may just tell me to fuck off.
I may do it anyway, just wish they weren't so loud. I'm gonna laugh if all of these attacks result in more people doing the same, resulting in a more decentralized Bitcoin that can't be fucked with by these (or future) assholes.

How about you use your CC for that (for now)?  You get 1-5% back and it's easy as fuck.  The amount of people bitching about not being able to buy coffee economically with Bitcoin right now is completely absurd.  I get that that is BCash's only thing and it's being pushed hard but everyone needs to relax, Bitcoin will get there (RIP BCash when it does) and it will be done right.  Unfortunately for now you're stuck with merely earning 20% a month relative to fiat and having tiny fees for securely transferring more than coffee money.

I meant civil action more so than criminal.  Like you say it's basically unregulated so there's no SEC or comparable to come down on them but private parties can sue companies or individuals and there's a lot more leeway in how they do it.  I could see some class action lawsuits dropping if evidence surfaces that Ver &amp; Co were deliberately manipulating the market (causing people losses) for their gain.  This becomes more likely the more widely accepted crypto is as an asset by the gov (imo).

Title insurance companies are called title companies, or even just "title".  I'm not sure what the confusion is there... They insure that the property is clear of liens and encumbrances, that is correct.  County records are far from perfect, especially for older homes, it would be incredibly foolish to not pull title for a transaction worth several hundred thousand dollars.  Unless you really just hate title companies, which is sounds like you do (lol).
Edit - you also seem to be a bit confused on the deed types.  A warranty deed is used when the seller guarantees the property is free from liens and encumbrances, is the lawful owner etc. A special warranty deed only covers the period the owner has owned the property (not guaranteeing any previous liens, etc.). You can use a warranty deed without getting title insurance, but then the buyer would have to come after the private party directly if there is a problem (find out there IS a lien, etc).  And again quit claims are not used for market sales.

After the announcement 2x was a failure I was hoping that both sides would be able to come together and move forward.  But nope, it looks like the "debate" won't be settled until one side is completely crushed.  On that note Bitcoin is the established juggernaut in the space and once the tech improves to make it both an established store of value as well as a currency, I'm not sure what BCH and the other alts will have to stand on aside from blind loyalty to Team Ver and hopes of regaining all of their lost capital.  I'm sure this will take a while and it won't be pretty but (hopefully) when the dust settles we'll have a more stable Bitcoin, which will only go to further promote its value.  
I'm also curious to see if any significant lawsuits/legal action will be taken against those parties deliberately (and maliciously) manipulating people/markets for their own personal gain.  I have my popcorn ready.

It's going to be a wild ride for a while, but for now I'd just stay away from exchanges in countries that are either fully (i.e. China/Taiwan) or even mostly (i.e. Japan) compromised and take advantage of their greed when they fall.

I really wish Ver would sell ALL of his Bitcoin for BCash and then go down with that ship.  But I'm guessing at the end of this (BCash) he will end up with even more Bitcoin (formerly belonging to his followers).  And then he will repeat with a new fork, and take the people he's already manipulated and stolen from with him.  And they'll blindly support him again, it's maddening.  
The more significant problem with all of this is he's actively damaging Bitcoin and cryptocurrency as a whole with his greed/madness/egoism.  I mean without this divide (created by a handful of people out of personal greed) we could all be focused on moving together toward a functional Bitcoin economy.  But instead we have a fake coin with a $21 bil market cap which is apparently supported due to having a temporary edge on transaction fees/times?  What happens when Bitcoin tech improves and BCash no longer has its single advantage?  It will be completely obsolete, and the BCash folks know it which is why they're making a hard push to take over Bitcoin (starting *the day* their 2x fork failure was announced).

With mortgage rates as low as they are (assuming U.S.) what's the rush to pay off the house?  I get the utility in the peace of mind that brings, but it's definitely not the best financial decision (in terms of maximizing $$) with sub 4% mortgage rates. Even if you want out of crypto if you invest that money in an index fund you're (likely) going to well out pace your &lt;4% interest rate, plus you get to write off that interest.

With inflation and leveraging that $143k *over 30 years* is negligible, it's actually a steal for the consumer.  This is assuming you keep the 30 year loan for term (this is important as you pay more interest relative to principal up front) and you invest your money competently (nothing crazy, I just mean you actually put your money to work for you in some capacity).

Did you consider waiting until ~January (12 months) so you could qualify your earnings as capital gains instead of income?  It may not matter as much if you're in a very low tax bracket, but it could save you 10+%.  I should note and emphasize that I am not a tax professional by any means, just curious if you considered it.  And I also recognize that there is utility in "having it done" versus purely optimizing income (especially in a market as volatile as this).  Oh, and congrats all around. :)

Who is saying that they don't want fees to come down?  Is this a serious post?  I mean a lot of people don't want to haphazardly implement bullshit tech solely to end this current *crisis* of people not being able to economically buy coffee but that's a lot different than arguing for higher fees.  Who is asking for high fees (well maybe aside from miners, lol)?  The tech will improve, fees will go down, Bitcoin will gradually become more and more adopted and useful as a currency.  Use your credit card to buy coffee now, in a year or so you can start using Bitcoin.  Don't be short sighted and buy into BCash's propaganda, their rhetoric has no merit.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:24:39
BCash shills act like Bitcoin is going to have these (new) high fees and slow confirmation times forever.  Or at least that is the narrative that is being *desperately* pushed.  The reality is that once the tech is ready, it will be implemented and problems will be solved.  This will occur over and over again as the tech gets better and better and better, as tech does.  But it will take some time, as it should, to make sure it's viable and not just rush it to market to make a profit.  Once the speed/fee issue is resolved and BTC is a store of value as well as a currency, there will be no (significant) demand for BCash.  They know this and are going all in trying to overtake Bitcoin before it's too late (and are doing a lol'worthy job).

There are title companies and most real estate transactions in the U.S. use them (I mean like almost every one). You don't have to if you're paying cash (or Bitcoin) but you would be stupid not to.  You're correct in that the previous poster is incorrect, but you're also incorrect...lol
Edit - and quit claim deeds are to remove someone from title, gift the property to a family member, etc not for a property sale to a private party. You would not use a quit claim deed in a property sale.

Coinbase is a great starting point as it's so user friendly, but it does have high fees.  You can move onto gdax pretty quickly and easily from Coinbase (owned by the same people) after you're more comfortable/familiar with Bitcoin.  As far as wallets go, that's something of a personal preference but if you're going to be investing a significant amount in Bitcoin I'd get a hardware wallet (Trezor or Ledger).  They're user friendly and very secure.  If you're just going to have like $100-500 or so then keeping it on the exchange isn't that big of a deal imo (but still best to transfer to a wallet).
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:03:59
This whole thing is so gross, I don't know how you could still support these people.  I hope Ver &amp; Co's next contentious fork after BCash fails gains less traction, but it's tough to say given their cultish following and money.  But on that note as more people and *real* money move into Bitcoin, the BCash (or whatever their next coin is) folks will be a relatively tiny faction.  Their ability to manipulate markets and lord over users with their wealth is coming to an end.
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:29:09
I don't recall on Coinbase but gdax doesn't charge anything on their end for BTC transfers so you just have miners' fees.  FWIW I paid ~$8 to transfer ~$4000 to a (Segwit) hardware wallet at the height of the BCash pump and dump.

It seems like more users running nodes is a natural market reaction to the threats of the big players moving their hash power to forks/alt coins.  It's pretty exciting/interesting to see where this will all go.  Having more of the user base running nodes will re-decentralize bitcoin and leave it less vulnerable to takeovers.  Free market ftw.
Disclaimer: I'm a Bitcoin noob and don't know what wtf I'm talking about.  Also, I'm considering setting up and running a node once I'm technically competent (I've been actively involved in Bitcoin for less than a month, after following it peripherally for years).

May be worth it for the instant transaction if you don't have fiat available in your account (for an instant buy) and don't want to wait a week for a transfer (especially during a fork, which you would then miss).
