Did you give a try to over-the-counter exchanges?

Yes, the majority of Chinese demand is now taken care of by only 2 major OTCs.

China is not coming back. It would seriously undermine the credibility of the country's decision makers. The platform will be closed by the Chinese government soon.

You have to use a middleman and there are really only two ways to make a secure P2P bitcoin transaction:  use an OTC or a Bitcoin aware lawyer. 
If you use an OTC, here are the the basics guidelines for a safe transactions:
- The more a buyer asks you to hurry/rush the more suspicious you should be
- Be careful about photoshopped payment evidence, never release Bitcoin from the escrow until you have confirmed that you have received the money
- Don't open any links that your trading partner is sending to you. If you must, use different browser than the one you are usually using. 
- Don't visit websites other than the OTC with the same browser that you're using to trade. Use a different browser to navigate on other websites.

Very unlikely. It's unheard of that Chinese government has ever come back on such important decisions within less than a year. It would seriously undermine their credibility, which is the source of their power. Take this from a guy currently working for the leading OTC exchange in China and dealing with the local regulators.
