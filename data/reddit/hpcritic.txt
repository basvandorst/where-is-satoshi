This is what nobody seems to understand about Bitcoin 2.0 stocks. It's ALL mutable, even the stocks you hold in private Bitcoin wallets on the Bitcoin blockchain.
By all means, store all the stocks you want to inside a Bitcoin wallet. Imagine suddenly your wife divorces you, and you lose 50% of your assets in the divorce proceedings.
**But you refuse to give up the stock ownership.**
Since a company backs the stock that is being held in your Bitcoin wallet, the court can correspond with that company, **overriding your actions**, making the entire gimmick of putting shares inside your Bitcoin wallet pointless and even harmful as your actions still result in your assets being seized with the additional charge against you of being in contempt of court.
How exactly is that much better than a centralized database?
Now, don't get me wrong. This isn't to say Bitcoin 2.0 is completely worthless. After all, that would be like saying decentralized prediction markets aren't valuable, or that derivatives aren't valuable. You can't stop people from betting on the price action of a stock, which can be the next best thing next to outright ownership.
**But ownership is ownership.** The reason Bitcoin is special is you either have it, or you don't. It doesn't matter what a court or government says you own.
For this reason, Bitcoin 2.0 stocks will ALWAYS be a sideshow, from now and forever into the future. When publicly traded companies issue shares on the blockchain, nothing changes about the legal system that says if you own the share in a Bitcoin wallet, it's yours. Nope, it's what the court says and it's ultimately what the company says. They can decide not to pay you, decide to arbitrarily reassign your shares without your consent, etc. No 51% attacks necessary.
Yes, there are workarounds. Instead of having ownership over the stock, you bet on where the stock's price is headed in the future. THAT asset cannot be seized. But it's not a stock. It isn't the same thing.
The bottom line is the blockchain is ONLY good for safeguarding bearer instruments that legal authorities or entities have zero ability to alter, change or reassign. This puts blockchains if anything at complete odds with stock trading. Because when a court compels a corporation to take an action, like reassign ownership of shares, they don't have a choice in the matter.
TLDR; Bitcoin 2.0 stocks are a gimmick. Get used to monkeys making screeching sounds as they champion their various "Blockchain" stock trading platforms that they've dumped millions of dollars into.
At all levels, they are just pretending like the blockchain is helping you secure your assets whereas your entire fiction of ownership will shatter into a million pieces the second a court of law becomes involved. It's extremely overvalued, and it irks me that so many people are now assuming "without *Wall Street* stock trading" Bitcoin is doomed. If you think Bitcoin is doomed without Wall St. sell everything you have, because those guys are off base and they don't GAF about liberty anyway. They're only here to bend over the blockchain and sell out to the greater fool.
