How many people want them and how much are willing to pay.
Is the rule of supply and demand.

I think that every seller need to do this type of incentive.
If someone can pay with paypal or bitcoin why he should choose bitcoin? With paypal the customer pay the exact sum, instead with bitcoin the customer need to pay also the fees ( I know they are very low, but there are).
The seller loose 2%-5% if a customer pay with the traditional methods, so why do not give to the customers a discount with bitcoin? Even the 2% for me is enough.

Only Google can access to your IP. You "only" need to trust them.

I explained what bitcoin is to my friends. I offered to help them creating they wallet for the first time but nobody accepted.
I think I should try with a small tip like your 5$.

In Android if you have app installed like supersu or in the settings you see the option superuser you have the root access.
But even with root access, YOU need to grant or deny root access to the apps that ask for it (you see a dialog every times).
In windows the root access is the "execute as administrator" or when you see the UAC popup asking your permission.
In Linux for execute a program as root you need to launch it with sudo/su (if is from terminal) or before the execution if it asks for your root password it will be executed with root privileges.
The difference is that in linux the system ask you always for your root password and in windows you need only to press the button "ok".
In android the possibility of grant root access to apps is disabled by default.

oh yes, this is the same for windows 7.
If you use a non admin account you need to enter the admin password.
