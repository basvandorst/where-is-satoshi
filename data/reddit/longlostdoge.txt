False (at least for me). I withdrew mine just fine. Although, everyone here should be aware when money moves like this, exchanges blow up and when the smoke clears, everything is gone. 
Be careful. Just remember that the entire reason we are trying to use public-key cryptography as a means of trust-less accounting is so that we control the keys.

So that's an interesting 1st world perspective I think people forget. I'm going to go ahead and layout the approach to this design and leave it to you to see if in the end you as a customer would be willing. 
Note - This is extremely important topic bc isps can essentially target and deny new nodes from syncing, stunting growth. However it may just be too high risk/acceptance to pull off. 
I've browsed common storage methods and thought about availability of materials, along with possible shipping problems, availability, contamination, confiscation, and forgery. The most effective way do this will be blank blue-rays. They're essentially flat and in turn, they are more manageable and weatherproof than a USB. 
A dual layer BDR can hold 50GB. 
They're about $.20 on Alibaba for a min *1200pc order. That means burning a copy of the block chain, and shipping it is less than $2 
($.60 for bdr, $.20 to burn it, roughly $1 to ship)
If you are willing to actually pay $5 for a hard copy of the block chain (markup and overhead increases sale price in almost all cases) then this is possible. If $5 is too much it'd be too tough to approach this market.
If the case is the former then I can begin setting this up for the community if I see a similar drive behind support for this in the community  
*EDIT : 1200pc order, not $1200

Underrated post. With the most recent recent rise of bitcoin, Coinbase surely has heat on their backs. Bitcoin has never really held this price point for this long. If you are using any tactic that could mask or differ minor details of your account that they can notice, it makes sense to auto-cancel via filter.
