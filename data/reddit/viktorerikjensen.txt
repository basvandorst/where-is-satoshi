It is up again. A twitter search will confirm that it was down. Lot's of tension right now. Try connecting to a specific server. leguin.freenode.net works for me.

I'm just the guy that posted the link. You want to talk to David, or rather want him to email you.

You guys should come over to  at irc.freenode.org. I have a transaction stuck since over a week now and beeing in that channel and understanding the issue better has helped me not to panic. I have come to believe that they will sort it out and I'll get my BTC eventually. That said I'm not so sure I'll use mtgox again anytime soon. They'll have to prove they're stable again first.

Jokes can be memes if they are ~~transmitted~~ *transferred*. Memes are so much more than captioned images. This joke in particular is most certainly a successful meme.

Lead Paragraph:  
Ludvig Öberg is 19 years old, an optimist and tech nerd. Now he wants to revolutionize the world of finance by bringing web currency bitcoin to Stockholm - because the banks are old-fashioned. "My generation doesn't wait to advance in the company, we do something. Now", he says. 
 
It is basically an article about the guy who bought Sweden's first bitcoin-ATM. He says hopes it'll be up and running in January. He bought his bitcoins when they were 5 USD a coin. He thinks 2014 will be a good year for bitcoin. Nothing worth reading for anyone involved but could attract some new users.

A lot of people saw this pattern back in April 2011. It has continued to repeat itself even so.

See   
I can confirm since the only bitcoin related service I've given out my email to is mtgox.

And now bitcointalk is down. Coincidence? Could be, but it seems suspicious to me.

Table 1 and 2 hurts my eyes with all that bright red and all caps. Other than that it looks like a great leaflet!
Edit: Bilag B is very pixelated and should be replaced.

The delays are real. Some get through and some don't. You can watch them accumulate on 
They are working on solving the issue with BTC withdrawal though.

Ah! Thanks. Might have to do some reading on that.

I had it that the people guessing combinations were working on every remaining lock at the same time and that once a working combination was found for one lock the combination for the reamining locks changed when they incorporated the newly solved combination into their own. Is that anywhere near the truth?

LobsterMan is a bot if that's of any use to you. But yeah seems like some kind of attack. Probably to cover up that there is no change or new info and that the current rally is based on nothing.

Replaceable but not interchangeable. Developers are mutagens introducing mutations to the code. Miners are then selecting which mutations to keep and which to kill. And then there is also the equivalent to genetic drift whatever that's called. Bitcoin has no mind of its own and especially no desires. Put two different dev teams with identical copies of all current Bitcoin code in separate but identical environments and the outcome will be two differing Bitcoins.

As a general rule in life you should never compare your current status or place in a hierarchy to others. The correct meassure is how you change that position. If your 0.00035 BTC turns out to be worth more a year from now then you did better than the person who just sold 35 BTC because they didn't believe in it.
