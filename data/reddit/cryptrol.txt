Do you believe people behind cryptonote have a cypherpunk agenda ? I am interested in what makes you think so.

I read the Wired/Gizmodo article, there is a little transcript of the conversation with him. IMO he is trying to show himself surprised of being caught, while at the same time giving away himself.

Nice find, was he selling or buying from HT?
@_date: 2015-12-09 15:00:49
It seems he is up to another kind of "mining".
@_date: 2015-12-14 21:45:48
I have been using blockchain.info for years for my pocket change. I always leave some there in case I am on the move and need some BTC, it's easy and secure. Sure they had some bugs, they fixed and refunded users with lost funds.
For long term storage or bigger amounts I use Armory or even Core on a secure (offline) computer.

+1 for full nodes being rewarded. Although if you can find a way of rewarding full nodes for just being and acting as a GOOD full node, mining makes no sense. 
Again it's the model, the mining proof of work, what is flawed. The Bitcoin price should not matter if the technology succeeds.

I have just deleted the thread, since it was obviously not the dev of Bitcoin Classic but his brother. Thanks for pointing it out.
@_date: 2016-01-20 13:29:02
Nicely explained, would be funny for the blocksize to be rised in the code and then miners keeping the defacto 768K standard :)
@_date: 2016-01-20 12:46:53
Agree, that's why I run a full bitcoin (core) node myself.
@_date: 2016-01-18 16:05:02
Bitcoin is used in many countries, not just in the USA. For instance common residential DSL lines in my country are capped between 0,3-1,0Mb of upstream. But thats not relevant, it seems that people want to push all the transactions to Bitcoin (even their morning coffee) to be on chain, this won't work because Bitcoin is simply not designed to work at that scale, it doesn't matter the size of the block, it won't work.
Full nodes are important for the network, and I don't think a modest block size increase will necessarily take down the number. 
Some devs (Gavin for instance) have oversimplified the issue on scaling to a block size increase (20Mb at first, 2,4Mb now) and bandwidth constraints. This was irresponsible and have turned against Bitcoin itself.

Agree on the importance of "human" assets, good point. And IMO, Bitcoin core excels here.
@_date: 2016-01-18 14:10:25
The problem with timed increases (as in 10Bytes for every mined block) is that it is really difficult to predict the network growth, adaptive block size would be better at this, but again, a changing/evolving security parameter is a headache. With a fixed block size you are more on the safe side of the debate.
@_date: 2016-01-20 11:45:35
Really? That's great. We could even mine Bitcoin again, yay !
However I can't seem to find the github PR. Link ?
@_date: 2016-01-20 10:20:22
I don't know either of them. So, how is the main dev called ?
NVM: Jonathan Toomim, so the it was his brother.

There are some good point in that article.
SegWit does indeed add some complexity, and is IMO, the latest of the features we need the most. Although I would like to see it deployed into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-18 10:23:37
Of course, although user greed has never been a problem for TCP/IP (well, there is still many people HODLING on to TCP/IP v4 instead of v6).

Why this should be censored? That's one of the best writings I have seen in a long time. Insightful and right to the point.
@_date: 2016-01-20 12:44:45
Facts tell otherwise, although core is not in a hurry I admit.
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:37:30
True, it wouldn't be a good time for Bitcoin (in terms of FIAT) if all other world assets weren't crumbling.
But they are crashing hard.
@_date: 2016-01-18 15:07:40
I know you are trolling (must be) but anyway I will answer your comment, although you obviously have a strong bias, so I will not try to convince you in any way.
I don't like to talk about Blockstream as a company since I don't know their roadmap or intentions. But the people behind the company have demonstrated their commitment to evolving Bitcoin, and have the know-how, and are putting their money and resources in doing it.
So, why the hate ? Seriously. Some people are scared of the fee's skyrocketing, well this is not happening any time soon. Sure there can be delays, due to legit or spammy transactions, but wouldn't a smart, permanent solution to the scaling problem be better than a provisional, temporary one ?
@_date: 2016-01-20 09:57:02
TLDR: The main dev behind "Bitcoin" Classic is stoned on the Bitcoin core slack chat, devs suggest him to go take some rest.
Would be great if some people appearing on the chat log can confirm it is legit.

I guess the answer is NO.
But as others pointed out, using a well known paper wallet generator could put you on the safe side for some time.
* bitaddress.org : the most foolproof option IMHO, use it offline, and use mouse and keyboard entropy.
* armory : very advanced and with a lot of options, thus not really fool proof.
Also blockchain.info have some really nice features for paper wallet storage.
I would advice to anyone :
* Keep it simple : Don't features you don't really understand or need.
* Keep it open : Use open source, well tested, software.
* Keep it (at least) twice : if your house burns with all your paper wallet inside, you will feel DUMB.
* Keep it virtual : Use a virtual machine environment to operate and manage your paper wallets and destroy it once done. Never install any software in it. Never connect it to the internet.

Because there is no such thing as a _good_ limit. Scalability will be off-chain or it won't be accomplished (at least in the short term).
Decentralized systems will always be less efficient in terms of speed and bandwidth for obvious reasons.
And there is currently only a good solution on the table for integrating off-chain transactions into bitcoin, and those are sidechains.
@_date: 2016-01-20 13:51:44
If it's a 75/25 split it will be a disaster for both.

@_date: 2016-01-20 09:32:46
TLDR : Lead Bitcoin Classic dev is stoned on the Bitcoin Core slack chat, most core devs instead of bashing him (which would have been absolutely appropiate in this situation), politely tell him to go get some rest.
Would be great if someone can confirm if this transcript is legit btw, there where well known devs atm this happens.

That's most provably true, but by the same argument you can't prove that a similar amount of Monero is in the wrong hands doing just that, although this is provably false.
Ah ... provabilities.

Just FYI, Bytecoin, which Monero is based on, has already implemented Multisig that lets you opt-out of the anonymity provided, but also a destination address with a view-key should obviously work.

Sure I can do that, and have also done it for expedia (no need for VPN just went to their global site), but what about goods that must be delivered ? Freight costs and delivery time are outrageous.
