LOL it doesn't take much.  Probably would have seen the same result if it was from 1996.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:58:02
I'm selling both testicles and filling my sack with bitcoin.  Weak hands better get ready for the bukkake fest.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:18:39
Set a goal then bounce or invest and once you start making a decent profit you pull your original investment and leave the rest.

or B: Those who sell @ $6500 and FOMO back in at $25k.
@_date: 2018-09-17 16:20:16
what's darker than completely black?  So what you're saying is it's actually going to get better?

I always wondered how much "Worthless" was valued at.  Now I know it's worth $111Billion, Well I guess I'm going to quit my job and everything else I do so I'm completely fucking worthless.  Can't wait! 
@_date: 2018-09-20 19:30:49
4. And potato
@_date: 2018-09-20 20:02:22
but a category of one.
@_date: 2018-09-05 22:50:36
What's the punchline?
@_date: 2018-09-05 22:59:45
Ohh man a rich person on reddit! Will you sign my potato?  
@_date: 2018-08-01 20:39:26
Who the hell does that on the weekend?  That's strictly a Tuesday, Wednesday event.
@_date: 2018-08-01 21:29:13
It'll be so much more!

Nom nom nom just eating this shit up like Pacman.

2 diet Pepsi's, and a taint tickler.
@_date: 2018-08-07 20:34:18
Decent amount of good news within the last couple weeks with no impact, and yet the ETF decision getting delayed (Not rejected) has this type of impact.  Got to love it! 
@_date: 2018-08-07 21:40:38
Well back to the original point it's just funny how this type of news which isn't bad news caused the price to drop.  
@_date: 2018-08-08 20:11:09
CBOE Response  if anyone cares
@_date: 2018-08-07 21:14:47
But yet that's the same % that causes these fluctuations for the most part.
@_date: 2018-08-02 13:36:46
Did July come a month late?
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:51:57
No, but I did just wake up with the most wonderful morning wood ever.
@_date: 2018-08-01 16:04:47
It's showing $4.8B without Bitforex and BitMex.  Something isn't right with the volume on those 2 exchanges right now.
@_date: 2018-08-10 23:31:12
Got to risk it, to get the biscuit.
@_date: 2018-08-09 04:54:39
LOL Until 8AM EST time when it dumps again.  I hope I'm wrong.
@_date: 2018-05-01 14:30:26
It was better than Jan, Feb and March! 
@_date: 2019-03-16 02:01:34
Does it matter?  Does anyone else's thoughts/beliefs have any impact on you?
@_date: 2019-03-08 22:10:12
Was only time until it happened.  Lets see how it responds! 
@_date: 2019-03-08 22:13:31
The great thing about Bitcoin is nothing looks as it seems.  
@_date: 2019-03-13 12:17:43
It's become a religion for the narrow minded.  Yes there are a ton of useless alt coins/tokens but there is also a lot of crypto projects with very good use cases and tech.
@_date: 2019-03-01 14:32:48
Words from Buddha himself. 
@_date: 2018-10-31 16:34:46
Wow it's pretty dead around here.
@_date: 2018-10-19 19:50:19
You should probably over react a little more and just make it 10 years.  
@_date: 2019-03-15 21:44:11
Blockport + USD can’t come soon enough, that’s for sure.  
@_date: 2018-10-31 20:17:25
LOL thanks for the down vote.
@_date: 2018-06-07 23:19:47
Very professional way to get your point across.  This is why Crypto adoption will take longer than it should.  Shit like that makes the community sound like children.
@_date: 2018-06-19 20:54:16
Looks like the same ol shit to me.  Although I would love to be wrong.
@_date: 2018-06-29 00:43:03
Can you please explain with facts?
@_date: 2018-06-26 01:36:56
Who knows, maybe this is the right price for Wall street.
@_date: 2018-06-07 23:35:25
That wasn't directed at you, but rather Mcafee.  Speaking like a douche bag isn't going to get us too far.  Just saying
@_date: 2019-02-11 21:39:35
Psssshhhh waste that bad boy, no way.  PM me for details!   
@_date: 2019-02-11 20:46:42
I woke up with a boner but can't remember what my dream was.   It might be a sign for moon!
@_date: 2019-02-12 19:40:20
As much as I don't want it to, it probably will.  But who knows that's the adventure of BTC! 
@_date: 2019-02-18 17:10:50
Made out of solid gold, and Bedazzled with 20ct diamonds right?  Yeah it's pretty crazy I know! 
@_date: 2019-04-01 14:47:25
Goes both ways.  
@_date: 2019-02-18 16:05:43
Everything is up to celebrate Viagra.

How full is your ass with these types of comments?
@_date: 2018-11-26 04:27:00
@_date: 2018-11-26 04:35:16
Cool, sounds like a pretty sweet life as a billionaire! 
@_date: 2018-11-16 13:52:56
200 boys? You should probably hire a lawyer after admitting this in public.
 
@_date: 2018-11-24 20:01:34
Hi!  My name is potato, will you be my friend?
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:56:04
Not at all, but people that only see $$ behind the idea of BTC.   
@_date: 2018-11-29 18:59:48
where is this coming from?
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:39:08
Yeah it's basically like floating around in a giant fleshlight.  Crazy! 
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:48:48
Narrow minded people lose in the game of life.
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:09:22
This is the truth!  I used the google to find this factual information.
@_date: 2018-11-20 21:03:51
There is no bottom when the buy orders just disappear.  
@_date: 2018-11-27 00:34:06
The early stages of computers and the web were a hassle as well.  As technology is adopted companies will build user friendly UI's so non-technical individuals can utilize the tech with little effort.
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:53:38
Ohh boy here come all the doom and gloom people.  
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:09:38
I'll agree to that.
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:06:32
But now it's a set date where 12/12/18 was not.  This should actually be a good thing.
@_date: 2018-11-29 16:01:33
Coinbase is mainly used for convenience, and new traders.  So it really depends on what you're looking for.
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:30:17
Most illegal things are paid with cash, not f bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-19 16:29:50
 So what you're saying is the frog has heat resistant armor on and will surf the boiling water to the moon. Strange analogy, but sounds legit! Thanks, I guess on that note I should buy more. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:14:22
I just took a dump, had to triple flush.  Thanks for the announcement! 
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:09:18
Exactly, I've never seen so many people that suffer from Bipolar disorder in one place.  
@_date: 2018-11-01 21:16:23
Well go rob a bank or something so we can get this process expedited.  
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:18:03
No such thing as red light, green light in crypto land.   
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:33:10
Ray Charles?
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:50:38
LOL you edit your posts now.  Great trickery! 
@_date: 2018-11-29 16:20:14
Is this like your pants are too tight type of shit here? 
@_date: 2018-11-21 18:30:32
That's the definition of narrow minded.   So what you're saying is when you invest into something you just look at the $$ and not the future potential of what you're investing in?
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:56:44
Until the graph is flat lined, it's not dead.  
@_date: 2019-01-10 16:39:00
Lol is he selling all his BTC to cover legal expenses?
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:18:22
Not so hard, you're hurting me!
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:30:12
I'm relaxed!   Happy Holidays Brother! 
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:28:03
This is good, gives us time to buy more.  Thanks for the informational services! 
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:19:13
Right when you think you found a good buy price the shit gets a boost leak and the NOS is wasted.  :)  But hopefully this is where it will settle and start rising again.
@_date: 2018-03-22 17:09:07
Wow bro where'd the bull go?
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:19:39
I once ate a brownie! 
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:27:53
But yeah nothing was funded with straight up fiat right?  LOL
@_date: 2019-01-19 23:26:55
If it's instantly converted to fiat why would volatility even matter to the retailer?  Whatever the cost of the product the % of BTC/s would be calculated at checkout than instantly converted to fiat. I would think it would be more of an issue for the customer than anything.  
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:33:40
More of common sense statement than a prediction.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:13:09
Don't worry the disappearing act comes next.
@_date: 2018-11-14 16:30:04
Just bought 400 sacks of potatoes with BTC.  Hopefully I can make a profit and buy back in. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:23:53
There is no norm in Crypto.  It's like trying to predict the behavior of a species that evolves every year.   Crypto will be like this until it's well over $1-$2 trillion marketcap.  
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:45:10
Which personality is this?
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:43:58
Had a strange blend to it.  Went from dark chocolate to milk chocolate.   Was a friggen masterpiece!
@_date: 2018-11-16 17:23:07
Would probably help if I spelled it correctly.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:05:35
I say 5k, then recovery.  Too many dildo monsters panic selling.  
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:35:05
"Should" is the big word here but a lot of people make emotional posts based on the state of their investment.   
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:46:03
The 8K battle is pretty intense!  
@_date: 2018-03-21 20:19:10
Why assume? You talk about proof but yet you have nothing to back up what you're saying.  I'm assuming you have a big red dildo next to your bed, am I right?
@_date: 2018-03-21 01:40:05
For the birds.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:13:39
The rich are just getting richer right now from the weak.  Sucks to see your money go down the shitter, but if you don't know what you're doing when it comes to day trading just wait it out.  
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:54:18
Have you ever been pro Bitcoin or made a pro bitcoin comment?
@_date: 2019-01-14 19:57:26
We have to get out of the roundabout first.  
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:29:33
Unless you need the money this instant then you didn't lose everything.  Be patient! 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:58:19
I wonder how many people have to be treated for bipolar disorder after going through this.
@_date: 2018-03-22 16:21:54
My beef strong!
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:57:25
LOL I love these people who disappear when the market is moving upwards, but the second there is any sort of dip they magically appear with the FUD.  Keep up the great work guys!   
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:02:13
Weird I always thought it was Hot Oily Dick Lube. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:48:40
It was clearly sarcasm.
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:54:20
The "LOL" didn't give it away?
@_date: 2018-02-22 03:22:57
May as well start trading dildos.   
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:29:27
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:18:56
Keep up the good work!   It’s like going into a football teams subreddit and saying their team sucks.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:10:44
Hot Oily Dick Lube!
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:57:05
Has to be just credit because I have no problem from checking with BoA.   People shouldn't be buying with credit anyway.  Buying with money you don't have increases these panic sell off's.  
@_date: 2018-11-26 04:30:03
Better short bitcoin then.  You can make the big bucks just like you always dreamed of.  
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:31:55
Not sure, but I really like unicorns! 
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:37:43
LOL I wouldn't doubt if this caused the market to dip.
@_date: 2018-02-22 04:22:08
No way, instead of leaving 1-5 star ratings your review is based on smell, and ware and tear.  
@_date: 2018-11-28 20:44:59
Sweet!  I had a 6" turkey sub for lunch.  
@_date: 2018-03-29 22:58:12
Not really a bright side to that.  A lot of people that make gains on alts dump it into BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:00:03
Thanks man!  Sold all my coins based on this input.  Can you please tell me what the upcoming Powerball numbers are going to be as well?
Thanks,  
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:15:14
It'll be numb soon, then you'll be immune to it.   
@_date: 2018-07-31 18:49:43
Hi Guys!  I'm here for the gang bang! 
@_date: 2018-07-10 14:15:01
I've already shit my shorts, thinking about switching to a colostomy bag.  Anybody want a sniff? 
@_date: 2018-07-31 20:43:00
Yeah sadly I misspelled goggles but was pretty damn certain on how to spell bukkake.  
@_date: 2018-07-12 21:48:44
Did your tractor break? because this would be a good country song.
@_date: 2018-07-12 21:50:50
Sweet!  Will my erection be bigger than 3" on Friday 10:45PM EST?  Please I need to prepare my extender if not.  
@_date: 2018-07-26 21:58:27
Buckle up or down?
@_date: 2018-07-16 16:44:26
As nice as it would be, this just seems like the same ol sheat.
@_date: 2018-07-31 19:21:18
I got the fast pass for this event sir, but you can borrow my bukkake goggles once I'm done.  
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:32:01
Do you just shit allot?  I don't understand how someone could just continue to repeat themselves for 8 + hours without either having a stroke or just have a shit problem.
@_date: 2018-07-13 01:01:08
Is this a repeat of Jun 21-29? Even though BTC is random as f, it has a similar pattern.
@_date: 2018-04-18 01:41:49
Maybe 60k bloody dildo's over the past 4 months.
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:33:44
Hold your green dildo!
@_date: 2018-04-22 04:23:18
It seems your assumption is sexist. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 21:47:18
All we can do is wait and find out.
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:26:52
I'm sure he meant in the sub.
@_date: 2018-04-12 02:04:03
Very professional Title!  No one will waste their time with it once they see the title.
@_date: 2018-04-21 14:26:19
Is she telling you this with a mouth full?  You could have misunderstood.
@_date: 2018-04-17 22:22:55
All the Verge dumpers cashing out?
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:10:06
No Clue, maybe $2800 then start seeing it recover.  
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:33:01
Hmm,  I don't know how to respond to this other than I'm so for your loss.
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:40:45
Sham wow! 
@_date: 2018-12-20 23:20:08
LOL I hear ya.
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:30:34
I wouldn't ask anyone here for advice.  BTC can go either way so it's a choice I would recommend doing additional research on.  
@_date: 2018-12-04 16:31:02
I can't be the only one with a boner right now.  
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:21:01
Is that a new coin?  I always tend to look if a female has long butt or short butt, but I agree I prefer short butt!
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:04:33
If only anyone knew.  
@_date: 2018-12-07 17:58:42
Gotcha, yeah to be honest it really comes down to your threshold for the volatility.  Me personally I would buy a little at a time with that 10k (Only if it's money you're willing to lose) in case it continues to drop.  
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:55:16
Should be a little more specific that you're talking about BCash.
@_date: 2018-12-05 18:40:38
If you do a little research you'll have your answer.  It's quite obvious financial institution want in (Pending approvals) or are already in and just waiting for their infrastructure to be fully ready for the masses.
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:50:26
Yes I personally know, but not everyone clicks on links posted on reddit for the obvious reasons. People see BTC and will assume your referring to BTC. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:13:14
Again people may assume as one already did that r/BTC is referencing Bitcoin and not bitcoin cash.  I'm not saying the op was wrong I'm simply stating they may want to be more specific as it may not be as obvious to some as it is for others.  That's all!  
@_date: 2018-12-03 20:55:19
You have a lot in common with Maxine Watters that's for sure.  Only difference is the shit leaks to your typing fingers, rather than your mouth.  
@_date: 2018-12-12 16:09:55
As nice as it would be, this is just the same things that's been going on for the last 2 weeks.  $3200-$3600 seems people are making their profits within this window.
