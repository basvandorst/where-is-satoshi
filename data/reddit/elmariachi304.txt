You’re trying to catch a falling knife.

Bought .02 at 17600 today, you’re not alone

I bought in for the first time 8 days ago. On one hand, I'm encouraged that the price has held this long. On the other hand it's been pretty boring to watch :-|
Anyway, the future bodes well! I would buy more if I wasn't in the middle of buying a house.

Not sure if you're retarded or just trolling but you still need a gas grid for that

John McAfee is a criminal and a con artist, also responsible for some extremely shitty software I know the users of this subreddit must be familiar with.
Are the idiots taking this guy seriously the same virgins that worship that skinny little Serbian kid from Brooklyn getting his ass fucked in federal prison right now?

This is America, where we’re fine charging the dumb or poor extra for services. If you didn’t know you could have just called your bank for your balance, used their app to check it, gone into one of your bank branches or even use a 3rd party ATM that doesn’t charge to display your balance (of which there are many) then yes, you’re expected to pay the $2 stupid tax. 
Now, do you really think someone dumb enough not to know this is going to be able to set up and manage a bitcoin wallet? And did you realize it wouldn’t solve the problem that you specifically had, taking money out from a third party ATM?

I bought .02 BTC when the shit was $16,000, waiting for my lambo to come in the mail any day now

Lol ok, whatever you want to tell yourself ✌��

Most people like to know before they enter a transaction what it costs, don’t you?
@_date: 2019-05-19 17:54:34
Nice thought, but it doesn’t work that way.

You just know an “investment” or a cryptocurrency is well on its way to shit when bag holders start to say “I’m not even doing it for the money! This is a lifestyle/philosophy!”
I’ve seen it so many other times with tech companies,
pharma companies, etc. Just a bunch of bag holders helping each other come up with excuses to tell the wife why it’s ok you emptied the savings account. Because “hodl”.

This is another reason why 99% of people want nothing to do with bitcoin, look at all the shit you just described you have to do. “Predict fees” wtf?

You gambled and got lucky, congratulations.
There's no way to perform a fundamental analysis on Bitcoin. There are no financial disclosures to read, nor earnings reports. There's nothing to compare it to. You got lucky, and that's great, I'm glad for you. But don't for one second think you're smart because you made money doing this. Keep playing "the game" this way and you will lose it all very quickly.
EDIT: A week later, Bitcoin loses 41% of its value. You fucking idiots...
