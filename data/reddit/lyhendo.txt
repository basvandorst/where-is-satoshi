Thanks, I did a quick search through the white paper but didn't find the relevant information yet.
Hmm, just a thought, if broadcasting reliable, trustless transactions with decentralized nodes would have so many constraints on the main chain and would be slow. Broadcasting those on LN would not be much better?

But one can answer untruthfully for sure? And in that case the node will pay something out of nothing.
According to the LN whitepaper, even after the closing transaction is posted to the blockchain, there still needs to be 1000 blocks before the dispute period is passed so that the channel closing is finalized. In that case, one can post an old commitment to close a channel and the other party must catch the fraudulent closing within the period or the bitcoin is lost forever.

I think if one could post old commitments on the blockchain (like the LN paper suggests), one might also post misinformation on the LN.
But if the counter party or a paid third party actively inspect the information posted, they can prevent the fraud from happening. I don't know how much delay this process might cause tho. There's a long dispute period like mentioned above, but definitely automation of such inspection work would minimize the time required for a transaction to be safely finalized.

Lol, downvoting asking while trying not be offensive and upvoting stupid dramas. You think you are smartasses but you are not and know nothing and your sense of knowledge and humor sucks. Not everybody gives a sht about the bcash bitcoin drama or your low quality sub scuffle.

Lul, OK. Oh, btc stands for bitcoin cash, I thought that's another sub for bitcoin.

Thanks for the information. However, in that situation, AXA is acting as a central server and people are doing deals based on trust after all? (KYC means you are relying on the bitcoin credit ratings?)

How long would this process take? According to a stackexchange question, 'How is a node in the middle prohibited from keeping the money in a routed Payment in Lightning network?', you set up a "hashed timelock contract" (HTLC) with other nodes with a timeout period, and the middle nodes can wait a long time before confirming the transactions?

Hahah, yeah, people are biased. I hope LN will be a great leap forward, but it's kind of confusing for me atm.
