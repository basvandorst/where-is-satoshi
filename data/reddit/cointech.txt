Yes and no. In theory, with fixed demand and a decreasing supply, the value of an individual Bitcoin should continue to rise however this simplistic view does not account for external factors which affect the price.

On the flip side, how many people have been subject to credit card fraud or identity theft because they use their card online? How many people have had extra charges piled onto their credit card which they did not know about and who had to spend lots of time trying to get them withdrawn?
Buying with a debit/credit card is no guarantee that you get working goods to your door or that you get it returned in a timely fashion. This is just a veneer of security which can be quickly rubbed away.

I think the way in which they are implemented is annoying, spamming comments around.
But I think the underlying concept of micro transactions, of tipping people for their efforts, is actually a great idea.
People around the world are contributing online, whether it's music, photos, creative writing, technical information etc... and any people would like to tip people for their efforts.
You see a really nice Flickr picture? Here have 50c, it might not be a lot of money but it's not meant to be. People think this is some how obnoxious to give someone 50c because they feel like in person it would be incredibly demeaning to give someone such a small amount but it's not in person, it's online and it's 2014. Micro-transactions WILL be a part of our future, it's will become the defacto way to monetize good quality content in the digital age. Even if people gave just 10c, it only takes 100 people to drop a few pennies for someone to get $10 for their efforts.

Sorry my bad, yes I was thinking the same thing in my mind that you would rather that individuals send their hashed key so that the central authority would never see the actual key but I wasn't sure that is how the multi-sig addresses worked, I only started reading up n them properly recently.
@_date: 2014-03-11 16:26:31
There is really little point in worrying yourself over what will happen because there is nothing you can do to directly affect it. You can just remain vigilant and do your best to stop it happening again.
My advice would be to sign up for a credit checking service like CreditExpert. I get live updates if anyone even looks at my credit report let alone tries to sign me up to anything. It also includes identity theft insurance should it actually happen.
I have been subject to many many data leaks over the years. Met Police have contacted me twice because they found my data somewhere as part of an investigation. My CC has used 3 times to run up bills over £10k. I often get phishing e-mails tailored with my name + old address and often get telephone numbers from suspicious countries with people asking for me by name. If I think about it I will go mad, so I pay my subscription and I hope for the best :)
BTW that's twice my MTGOX data has been leaked. Does the second time really count? I mean they already had my data the first time around....
@_date: 2014-03-11 17:10:29
Yeah I can appreciate it's not an insignificant amount of money to be spending per month on something like that. By the sounds of it £15 a month could be a waste of money for you.
One thing to consider, if you are going to be moving house/changing address sometime soon that will go a long way to stopping scammers. These days you need to provide your last 3 addresses to get any credit. Changing your bank account will seal the deal and they should find it quite hard to do anything if they don't have your latest address/bank details.
For me it's worthwhile as I have a number of accounts and credit agreements. This allows me to keep an eye on them all through one portal and get alerted if anyone even touches/looks at my credit report.
@_date: 2014-03-11 16:14:16
Would you feel better if a company was setup which only verified your ID and had a bulletproof guarantee against ID Theft/Data leaks. Eg you will be compensated if your data was leaked.
So you signup to XchangeX, you then create an account at ID-COMPANY.COM, have them verify your details and then they simply pass through a token to XchangeX saying your ID is verified.
So the exchange need never know your full details or hold scans on your passport. Of course this relies upon trusting ID-COMPANY but presumably it's better than trusting a brand new exchange?

I get what you are saying, I certainly don't think the Free Market model fits a globalized society such as ours, that being said, there are lots of concepts in the Free Market which we should certainly strive to achieve.
I'm really quite open to regulation but it needs to be fair, it needs to be set up in such a way that it fosters competition. That is the good kind of regulation.

I think the solution to this problem would be to use a Bitcoin payment card. Eg a pre-paid debit/NFC card which you top up with Bitcoin and use to spend in shops, this allows you to use Bitcoin in all existing shops. I know Bitcoin enthusasists will say that's a terrible solution but considering how many payment terminals there are world wide, integrating with existing systems and processes _MUST_ be a priority.
I expect this will be the primary way of spending Bitcoins in the very near future.


I agree. I am too shit scared of losing my coins and I think this is absolutely critical to the future success of Bitcoin. Ultimately it will come down to two options. 1. If you trust yourself and have the technical knowledge, you can secure your own bitcoins. 2. If you don't trust yourself, you will have to trust someone else. I expect companies to eventually start offering secured Bitcoin storage backed by bonds etc.. . to securely safeguard your Bitcoins. We trust banks with our money, why wouldn't we trust banks with our Bitcoin? Many of the hardcore cypto anarchists won't like that idea but it's certainly a valid option.


Which is basically just a form of insurance which we all have to pay for in increased fee's. So we need a 3rd party to sit in-between consumer and supplier. There is no other option. Imagine if Paypal used Bitcoin as a core currency. You could pay with Paypal (in BTC) and rely upon their consumer protection service.
I expect someone like Bitpay might start offering this soon, probably as a tick box "Insure my purchase for 5% of the purchase value" to allow them to cover losses from shady suppliers.
@_date: 2014-03-05 11:42:15


There already is one, it's just not very user friendly. You need a scan of the customers government ID as well as the front of their credit card plus they need to sign an authorization form and invoice/contract giving permission for the charges.
That works in 99% of charge backs in my experience, unfortunately it does take a lot of time having to deal with these and for a $25 charge, it really isn't worth the hassle. For me, I was taking orders for £3-4k+ so we couldn't take the risk of those being charged back.

I'm not really qualified to comment on this but my gut feeling is that we as humans seek diversity. So if a single company would never hold natural monopoly forever, there will always be a competing forces looking to enter the market and disrupt the status quo.
@_date: 2014-03-05 21:58:51
Well it fills a need. People who have Bitcoin want a way of spending it. I admit it's not exactly a killer reason to use Bitcoin. I think it will be a stepping stone to much deeper integration of Bitcoin of which I can't fathom at this stage.

Don't forget that lots of dedicated hosting companies also install secret root backdoors to support their automation processes, so dedicated hardware no guarantee that your shit is secure.
The only way to be absolutely certain is to buy your own server and co-locate it yourself in a secure rack.

Just FYI. The second one single entity controls Bitcoin is the second that Bitcoin becomes worthless.
Just worth pointing out when people talking about 51% attacks and so forth. The only possible outcome would be to seriously destabilize and possibly kill the network.
In which case it's going to cost a shit load of money to build a computer big enough to keep up with the ASIC's around the world.
It would be cheaper and easier to just keep siezing or buying coins. If they held enough of them they could certainly gain leverage over the market.

Some might be confusing transaction time with confirmation time.
Transaction time is how long it takes for a payment to be registered on the network.
Confirmation time is how long for that payment to be verified by the network. ie. rolled into a block.
Transaction time can be quite long sometimes because it relies upon transactions filtering through a P2P network, so it can take time from when you press PAY for the supplier's software to see the transaction.
The solution to this was outlined in the other big thread - The client + server have to sit on the same node, or be extremely closely connected.
@_date: 2014-03-10 10:57:17
This is really important. As a retailer myself I am trying to keep as much BTC as possible back. We are setting it around 20% so far and will adjust it depending on our costs. We would love to be able to pay our suppliers in Bitcoin in which case the Bitcoin economy will really start moving.

I just launched my new site last week. We accept Bitcoin for computer components and gaming hardware. We ship to the UK + Europe through the site, or on larger orders we can ship world wide
Anyone into their mining we just got some ASROCK BTC PRO kit stock ready to ship and they are at crazy low prices until the end of the week.

A big part of what makes a free market work is competition. If you fuck up and piss people off, they can move else where and your business will suffer and die.
The problem with our market currently is that it's not truly a free market. There are lots of industries in which they are so locked down and tied up by the existing companies that new competition is quickly put out.

Exactly what multi-signature addresses aer designed for.
A multi-sig address has multiple private keys and they can be configured so that at least X number of people must sign the transaction in order for it to be valid.
So yes, you can just generate a multi-sig address and distribute the private keys to 10 people for example and then you would need say 6 of them to sign the transaction for it to be valid. (or however many you want)
edit: found someone who has developed an opensource implementation of multi-sig verification script : 
The key will be literally, the key. A single authority has to generate the multi-sig address with the private keys so you have to be certain that the keys are not leaking at generation time and that you are giving them to the authorized people in a secure manner.
@_date: 2014-03-06 09:42:42


It's a stepping stone my friend. You don't reinvent the current system overnight, change will take time. The good thing about Bitcoin is that you can choose to trust a bank or you can trust yourself. You always have the power of choice. That has to be better than the current system even if it's still flawed?

The likelihood of pulling off a double spend reliably is quite difficult so at most you are looking at a very rare edge case.
Considering the current system of credit card fraud in which retailers can be subject to charge-backs months down the line, the system of instant Bitcoin transactions makes a lot of sense. On balance, Bitcoin has almost 0 fee's with no chargebacks. In comparison with cards you can be paying 2-3% on your transactions plus chargebacks. So you can afford the 1 in a million chance that someone double spends a £100 food bill.

No I'm not arguing against regulation itself or suggesting that it results in monopolies. But you have to consider where much of this regulation came from? Often times it's large powerful organizations who wield so much power that they can put in place regulations which act in their favour, 
So it's not regulation that I don't like, it's regulation which isn't always in the best interest of the free market. And that is really explained by the political power which money can buy these days.

This is just Russia posturing. The EU and US have been putting pressure on Russia and Putin cannot seem weak in front of his nationalist supporters. So this is their reply.
I cannot see any situation in which it actually happens unless this crisis really goes down the pan, it would be too damaging for Russia.
But, they will certainly lay the foundations and let you know they aren't afraid.
