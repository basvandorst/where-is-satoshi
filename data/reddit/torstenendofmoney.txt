which fact do you mean exactly? 
@_date: 2016-08-26 06:53:13
agreed. Rise and Rise focuses much more on mining. 
Our 60 minute doc talks about mining for less than a minute. but we do show how fiat money is created at quite some length. 
@_date: 2016-08-26 03:33:09
great to hear. 
we always appreciate a small donation in order to recoup the production costs:  
@_date: 2016-08-26 03:14:09
It's John Barrett from the Bitcoins and Gravy podcast
@_date: 2016-08-26 03:35:05
yes. we had it on various VOD platforms for a year and are now starting with broadcast and YouTube etc. Still trying hard to recoup the production costs. We have received a few awards and the film has been shown at many meetups and at conferences and even in universities. We would appreciate if you guys could rate and review us on imdb, too.  
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:09:39
hahaha. You're a genius, mate. revenge of the coinstars lol. I think I'll get back to you in a few months to tap into this stream of creativity. Wonder what you can come up with once you see parts of the footage :-) 
@_date: 2018-01-04 10:55:33
huh? u alright?
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:08:11
yes you're spot on. we have the main structure (see my video and the parts that i want to focus on this time) but at the same time we will also leave for a bit of flexibility. Last time we had some very juicy quotes from Andreas so we added a new section to the film. Here's the Kickstarter: 
@_date: 2018-01-04 07:02:08
We're aiming at mainstream TV documentary and there are not many that have achieved global distribution. Our first film was broadcasted on TV in China, Taiwan, Sweden, Kenya, ... and reached a wide audience, usually people who have not previously thought about Bitcoin or Money before. 
You're right that there are tons of videos on YouTube - but this is for someone who already knows what to look for. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:05:48
Here is our Bitcoin documentary  based on our earlier film (2015) which has reached millions of people on TV and per download. We estimate that we brought 50k people into the Bitcoin ecosystem and just launched the Kickstarter for the newer, better, bigger film. Of course, we also accept crypto here:   
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:13:58
Hope that some of you remember our documentary from 2015. 
We just launched the campaign on Kickstarter but obviously also accept crypto here:  
Looking forward to hearing some ideas about a new title for the new project. And also, please do share the link. We need all the support we can. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:25:58
the first one is kind of nice. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:29:02
It's the footage for when I say "we're covering both sides of the argument" so we used the Bitcoin Core logo from the website and the BCH logo. I think both are shown for an equal amount of time. 
Not taking any sides here. 
In fact, I think the real question is about fiat vs crypto (see our first documentary). 
Also, when talking about ICOs we will be both covering the super successful ones and the scams/frauds. Would you want to watch a documentary that just focuses on one and ignores the other? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:06:50
yeah! good one. there is a lot of footage of him on major tv channels as well and he surely has tons of great&amp;controversial soundbites. Is he on Reddit? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:51:56
Here is the Kickstarter Link (for contributions in fiat):  
Of course we will cover the 'scaling debate'. Please let us know who we should interview (from both sides). And please help spread the word. 
Our first film was released in 2015 and we estimate that it brought 50,000 people into the crypto space.

I think that Wallstreet and the traditional banking system will indeed invest, start funds, start trading, offer bitcoin denominated services, buyout bitcoin startups, etc etc. is that a bad thing? not sure. If anything it will drive up demand and price. maybe that's bad for volatility if that's what you are suggesting. But can they 'break' Bitcoin? I don't think so.

Mate, not everything is a conspiracy :-) I personally conducted the interview in Miami, but we edited my questions out because you can not hear them well (two microphones are pointed at Bernhard but none at me behind the cam). We had an editor paraphrase the questions and insert them as text. Listen to what Bernhard says, I don't think there is a 'fake' word in it, not sure why he or we would 'fake' anything here. Pls explain.

There is a new Kickstarter campaign with focus on Alt currencies here:    (Dec 2015)
The most successful one was this one:   (not sure about the status)
and we are also currently live on Kickstarter with a small fundraising goal (about 1/6 of total budget, the rest is self-funded):  (Dec 2014)  
Our aim (and professional background) is TV and we will be releasing the film worldwide. 
I think that in order to get Bitcoin to mainstream there must be DOZENS of TV documentaries, and thousands of different youtube clips, series, etc. So there is no competition among filmmakers in my view. The audience is potentially billions of people. 
So maybe an idea could be to work together on this. For example we could give you some of our interviews that we have shot already (like this one:  and if you get a lot of traffic and response you can do more yourself (or in collaboration with us/others). Maybe there are other ideas, too.

ok fair point. especially when it's short answers like Yes, No, ... what did he just say yes to? 
but in this case the answers are pretty much self contained as we always ask interviewees to repeat and rephrase the question so that we have full statements, rather than 'responses'. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 15:37:20
Noone is saying that, mate. It's just a point that often gets overlooked, just as the fact that fewer people got killed on the street dealing with drugs. Media is good to tell the scandalous stories (see the Matt Miller/Bloomberg interview re: this very topic).

Hi Matt, 
just a thought. In December when you did the 12 days of Bitcoin, many of your co-hosts and other Bloomberg anchors were highly sceptical of this magic Internet money. Yet, a few days ago one of your colleagues said this re: the DISH news. "... isn't is kind of obvious that ALL companies will accept Bitcoin eventually, so what is so special about this news?".* 
Maybe it would be a good idea to illustrate how quickly the opinions have changed 180degrees. In my view THAT is the real big story.

You are both correct. In the history of money chapter, which is about 12 minutes at the beginning of our documentary we do cover this aspect in detail. It is just like you say. For the trailer, we took this verbal 'shortcut'. Thanks for pointing it out. 
@_date: 2015-05-01 23:38:37
Thanks for your comment. I disagree. We spent a large amount of money on this production (interview shoots on three continents). If you look at the trailer again, there are two short scenes from an IMAX filmmaker (total of 4 seconds) which costed us $1000. We licensed another 6 seconds within the trailer for 300$. ... We cannot keep up with these sorts of costs for the entire 60 minutes. So, yes, we did use a lot of stock footage, too. Remember, the film is 80% self-funded by me, 20% or so was from Kickstarter supporters. Unlike many television productions were are not supported by Government grants and we also do not have a broadcast commission. Overall, I think we spent the money wisely. Do not worry, there is plenty of original content in the documentary. We also have made all of our raw interviews available on YouTube. More to come in the next few weeks...

Thanks Erik. We just heard from Amsterdam Film Festival:
"Special Jury Prize, World Cinema Documentary Short: Bitcoin: The End Of Money As We Know It directed by Torsten Hoffmann, Michael Watchulonis" 
We will release the film at Freedom Fest in Las Vegas in July.

Yes. am aware of the site. for our poster, we do not yet know what exactly we want. there are so many ideas. a design contest is the best way to get many different ideas from many designers. 99designs is the biggest such platform. 
For other things which are already clearly defined hiring freelancers on fiverr or elance is great.

tl;dr "ordinary citizen...cannot simply...call up the prosecutor  and have legal proceeding cancelled. Dimon did just that. .... Settlement monies were not called fines or penalties,  was allowed to treat $7B as a tax write-off." nuff said
@_date: 2014-06-29 18:36:46
I have to fully disagree here, mate. 
- film distribution is tricky and takes time
- film festivals are very tough to get into and they oftentimes demand premiere (no prior release). 
You are right about the 'outdated' part and our solution for this is not to talk about anything news related to increase the 'shelf life' of the film. We explain this here: kickstarter.com/projects/bitcointheendofmoney/bitcoin-the-end-of-money-as-we-know-it 
and here:

Quick note on the audio quality. As you can tell, it's not a clear sound. In the meantime we have fixed it. You can hear better audio in the other interviews on the same YouTube channel.

Producer of award-winning Bitcoin documentary and long-term media professional here. Interesting idea. I have been approached about other fictional Bitcoin stories, movies, etc. before. Let's talk about this in some more detail ....

shocking! 
@_date: 2015-08-03 10:10:04
1) is a fair point. 
2) he certainly was an early adopter and that's what his quote was about. 
Thanks. I appreciate it. 
I agree with you re: "not a surprise". When it was released I made a statement about pirating it and for those who 'really' can't afford it, at least they can tell their friends, share it on social media, rate us on imdb, so help the film in other ways. Yes, more pirated views certainly than paid ones. At leas,t we received about a dozen donations on:  
@_date: 2015-08-02 08:42:59
Thanks for this AMA. 
You mention above (several times) that there were several offers from investors to buy Mt.Gox. Can you shed some light on this, please? If you can't/don't want to mention any by names maybe you can categorize them? Were these rich private investors? Bitcoin early adopters? American banks? ...

@_date: 2015-07-14 23:21:40
we're working on that now. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 20:17:32
yes, we made this for those who still don't understand Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 22:46:28
- Issues with out-of-synch subtitles have been resolved on vimeo
- TheProtocol.TV allows streaming and download with Bitcoins
- Remember that this is not a film for Bitcoin users (who already understand the technology and the flaws of fiat); this documentary is for people who don't yet 'get it'
@_date: 2015-08-03 03:11:09
theprotocol.tv is the bitcoin option. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 05:17:17
correct. in both cases about 90% go to the makers of the content. Vimeo is slightly less   Amazon and iTunes even lesser. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 12:17:52
awesome idea. congrats. keep working on it! 
@_date: 2015-07-14 20:18:30

Hi, we will be releasing the full documentary (60minutes) next week. See my comment here:  
@_date: 2015-07-26 11:23:17
Sad indeed. Seems like Gov't never learn, though. 
We used 10 trillion dollar notes from Zimbabwe and a 5 million dinara note (Yugoslavia) in our Kickstarter campaign last year. We also talk extensively about inflation of the USD in our history of money chapter in our documentary. Same thing, just happening a bit slower. here's Jeffrey Tucker's quote on the subject:  
@_date: 2015-07-23 10:12:00
Yes, you are right. I was a guest on the show to talk about our documentary along with book authors Mike Casey (MIT Lab Digital Currencies) and Paul Vigna (New York Times). It was a 60 minute live show with 7 or 8 callers asking questions ranging from security to ecommerce. I don't know how many people tune in to this radio show but it is def. a great tool to get the Bitcoin word out to the mainstream. This is part of the reason we made our film, too. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 04:34:43
Yes. on vimeo we have them live. trying to get them on TheProtocol.TV now. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 09:22:54
thanks, you're a star! tell us how you liked the film here (and on imdb). 
@_date: 2015-07-14 20:20:27
lol. upvoted. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 20:25:01
remember that this is not a film for Bitcoiners. This is for your friends, colleagues who have not yet understood the technology, hence we needed to explain the context
@_date: 2015-07-07 21:35:47
Hi. I am the director and producer of the documentary (60 minutes). The world premier is today in Las Vegas (Freedom Fest) and we will release the film on all digital platforms next week. We decided to do this project with the great team at Streamium because we think that the tech is super cool and has potential. We love and support Bitcoin Startups. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 07:25:05
Thanks for mentioning us. You can see our documentary in several places, here is a good overview:  
@_date: 2015-08-05 11:41:28
your post needs to be upvoted. good advice. 
(no endorsement for bread or mycelium, I haven't used either)
@_date: 2015-07-14 22:55:16
we don't really talk about Silk Road at all. we have a social scientist talking about what was going on there because ignoring it would have been a big mistake (many people know bitcoin because of the silk road media coverage). then roger ver ends this segment by saying :"lots of people want to criticize Bitcoin because you can buy illicit things with it. but if you look at it the number one currency for doing bad things is the US Dollar" 
thought that this is a clever way to handle the topic. what's your suggestion 
@_date: 2015-07-17 02:53:25
thanks. theprotocol.tv have now the 1080p version online and subtitle file as well. please rate and review on imdb if you liked the film.
@_date: 2015-07-23 10:12:27
agreed. Super smart lady. Great radio show. 
@_date: 2015-07-29 10:15:07
Hi. Thanks, mate. Yes, we've tried hard and covered a lot of ground in these 60 minutes. You'll find that this is the film that might convince your friends and family, those who still don't understand what makes you excited about Bitcoin :-) 
@_date: 2015-07-14 22:53:01
I'll send them to theprotocol.tv people. let's see if they can embed it. if nothing happens in 36 hours, get in touch with me and I'll send you the scc file. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 12:38:26
Kind of agree with the music part, at least in principle. but it's subjective. if you look at the youtube comments (10,000 trailer views in 3 days) most people liked the EPIC-ness of it. 
Length of trailer. I don't know about that. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 21:43:04
We are releasing our documentary this week. You'll find us on all major platforms (more news to come). Today we launched the BitTorrent Bundle where you can download the film plus a ton of bonus materials for 7$. 
We spent 2 years and 80,000 dollars on this project, but some of you might still not be willing to spend money for it and that's fine. If you can't afford to buy it, I am sure you'll find an illegal torrent. Maybe you can rate or review our documentary on imdb or recommend our film to your friends to help us out in other ways.

@_date: 2015-07-16 03:12:02
first thought: why do they "need" additional info. with Bitcoin you don't....
second thought: it's a charity, maybe they actually do need to report their sources of donations at some level, to someone (?). 
anyway, I always wanted to donate with Bitcoin as well but had heard here on Reddit that it doesn't quite work. Will follow your lead now :) thanks for posting. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 09:23:49
ya fair point. what I meant was paid and free, I guess. our intent is obviously to recoup (some) of the production costs :-)
@_date: 2015-07-14 12:05:29
thanks, you're faster than I am. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 22:50:24
I am with you on the footage part. We underestimated the difficulty. Quite a challenge to "fill 60 minutes" with interesting visuals as most of the script talks about topics that are 'virtual' (money, debt, bitcoin, code, innovation). Would love to hear your opinion on the full film (imdb), remember it's targeted at those who don't yet understand Bitcoin fully. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 10:27:20
@_date: 2015-07-15 04:34:12
thanks. we made this movie for people who have previously not 'believed' in BTC but are curious about what the fuss is all about. So it would be interesting to see what your friends and colleagues who don;t own BTC, think about the film. Let us know. 
@_date: 2015-07-19 12:12:17
I agree with you, but people are starting to get curious as Bitcoin appears more often in the media. This is part of the reason we made our film. People without the technical skills or the understanding about the flaws of fiat will get a 60 minute crash course watching  
@_date: 2015-07-13 23:53:33
thanks. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 09:19:03
Yes. Later today, we'll be live on TheProtocol.TV and Streamium.io
@_date: 2015-07-15 04:35:50
I am actually also looking for it since I was not there in person. let me know if you can locate it anywhere. All I could find was a 60 second periscope link on twitter . 
@_date: 2015-07-14 20:36:52
as filmmaker it's important to be on all platforms (this includes iTunes and Amazon). You make a fair point but the TheProtocol.TV links have been all over Twitter and Reddit, too. 
"want to make money", we spent two years and 80,000 dollars on this, we won't recoup this (ever) with VOD alone. the more traction the film gets on social media, the more likely it will be picked up by Netflix or TV broadcasters. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 20:22:06
Thanks! appreciate it.
@_date: 2015-07-14 20:23:33

yes, we're working on that. For now the Kickstarter code (sent 2 days ago) are only streaming. Will send a new one later this week.  
@_date: 2015-07-15 04:32:47
we tried to film some Bitcoins in the 'wild' but were not successful. Illusive ...
@_date: 2015-07-14 12:46:01
yeah. we're working on that. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 10:26:38
thanks. really appreciate your comment. It's been a tough journey ... glad that the reception has been so positive. Please help spread the word on social media and among your friends. I think the film is actually perfect for those who are not into Bitcoin yet. Rate us on imdb, too! Thanks. Torsten
@_date: 2015-07-14 23:24:29
thanks. much appreciated. we are targeting the 95% of people who don't know yet about the flaws of fiat and the potential of bitcoin. we would have loved to explore more about the bitcoin2.0/blockchain stuff but decided not to because we'd lose the mainstream audience then. it's already quite technical as it is. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 20:25:36
@_date: 2015-07-14 12:34:19
I was referring to my comments at the top there re: someone not being able to pay. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 22:48:06
i know. about 2 years and $80k to be precise :)
@_date: 2015-07-14 00:22:15
yes. Tomorrow we'll be on streamium for streaming with BTC and TheProtocol.TV for downloads with BTC
@_date: 2015-07-14 20:26:24

@_date: 2015-07-14 22:55:43
it's on vimeo now. 
trying to get it to theprotocol.tv version now as well. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 04:31:40
yes we didn't invent anything new. the "he met Satoshi in Netherlands in the year 2005" is kind of new for Bitcoiners and am sure that many small factoids in the history chapter would be kind of new cool. but overall, you are right. this film is for people who have no clue about Bitcoin to make them understand why you and I are so excited about it. 
Re: Erik, have been following him on reddit, Twitter and have read two of his blogposts in the past but have never met him, interviewed him or seen his speech. pls link! thx. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 20:21:34
I actually agree and we cover that aspect of the adoption in the film. nevertheless, we needed a catchy title :)
@_date: 2015-07-17 08:08:14
Thanks for posting this. Fully agree. I met the Streamium team a while ago and can say that they are super sharp. I can see them going places (My background is also in the media distribution business). We decided to do a little beta test with them and it went very well: 
I agree with some of the other comments that there may be more applications possible for them in the future.  
@_date: 2016-02-03 15:17:52
yes, i agree. we had to rush quite a bit in the end of the film to squeeze everything into 60minutes. 
yes, thanks, there are three or four typos in the film. We can't fix it on the files that our already out in the 'wild' but will do minor editing for our commercial clients (TV, airlines, ...) and def. correct these. thanks. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 09:18:30
Yes:  
@_date: 2015-07-14 00:02:06
As filmmaker it is important to distribute as wide as possible to reach the largest audience. Hope you agree with one of the other companies (Amazon, iTunes, TheProtocol.TV - for Bitcoins, Vimeo, Streamium.io, ...)
@_date: 2015-07-14 09:20:35
Yes, we are big fans. Actually I just recorded an interview for the next show :-)
@_date: 2015-07-14 00:23:56
as far as I know its one big download, but maybe there is a way to download individual files. am not sure. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 20:19:23
actually most people like John as narrator. See Bitcoins and Gravy on the LTB network, the comments here and on the YouTube trailer :-)

Thanks for asking. Yes, both are extremely favorable for filmmakers. Vimeo is too, by the way. iTunes and Amazon take 30% or 50% ...
@_date: 2016-02-04 05:29:30
yes, I'm following all this drama. In fact each time Bitcoin is in the news we see a (slight) increase of downloads. 
I guess it is a natural process that the early enthusiasts are slowly leaving as a technology gets adopted by more and more people. In 2011 the first hardcore crypto anarchists left as the first start-ups (Venture Capital backed) entered the space. Then the libertarians rebelled against Wallstreet making Bitcoin investments. Now, Gov't get involved and yet again some people say that this is the end of Bitcoin. The smartest answer is to simply refer to articles like this: 
Regarding the management and governance of the 'movement' I don't have any insights or thoughts as I'm unfamiliar with this space. Sorry. 
In my view, two years from now more banks and Gov't will have accepted Bitcoin and the blockchain will be used in all sorts of transactions and other applications. Whether the price of Bitcoin is up or down, really doesn't matter. Even though I own Bitcoins I have always viewed the optimistic forecasts (to the moon) unconvincing. Nevertheless over the long-term the price will follow an "upward trajectory and lots of volatility", to quote blockchain.info's CEO.

Nice find. 
It's also worth reminding folks that the 'people' who create money (Banks and Fed) are employees of private entity. The Fed is not Gov't. 
In our film that we released this week we talk about other ways how Governments/rulers diluted the money supply (gold clipping).

its my 4th time on kickstarter but each time i wonder. this time less than 3% of funds came via KS platform.and they take much more in fees. i had not looked at SDTV in detail. can you direct me? filmmakers always need money to polish some of the material, buy more footage, or music rights. maybe i can give it a go. u wanna email me tomorrow?

nothing to see here (yet). The stocks of the Top3 banks in France are up 1.5% today. No one seems to be worried. Maybe their total cash balances aren't big enough to make a dent.

thanks. here are some interview highlights. [ people really seem to like the Andreas A., Charlie L., and Wences C. clips. 12 more hours to go on Kickstarter. Oh, did I mention that we have a broadcaster that will bring the documentary into 40 million households ! let's go mainstream, baby!

Thanks for posting. 
Here is the story of another hack. lots of social engineering (posing as journalist and co-worker) and weak internal company security protocols. Still an interesting case study:

We did an interview with a social scientist who studied the online drug markets on the dark web. See her comments on the "reduced street violence" here.

these are two different things. which is the best design, is most important. then we can optimize the fonts and the Bitcoin logo. So you prefer the sign similar to $?
Can we have a different survey. Noone here likes the B drawn like this?

This is the uncut interview we produced in New York a few months ago. It does not cover Bruce's candidacy for the Bitcoin Foundation but covers a very broad range of topics. 
Our documentary  is almost finished. you'll find more interviews on the same YouTube channel. You can see a preview of our film as well as some thoughts about our distribution strategy here:
 
Please help us vote for your favourite poster design. We'll also use this as DVD cover. The survey only takes 30 seconds.

Hey guys. We released the film a year ago and are happy that it's so popular. We won four awards, too. But 99% of views are torrents which means that we couldn't recoup our production costs. If you want to help us out, share the word, rate us on imdb 
 follow us on Twitter:  
But please share the vimeo, iTunes, or Amazon Links. 
You can also pay by Bitcoins here:

Did you see the post about CoinJar's debit card that's now available in Australia? In this case both users wouldn't even know/realize that Bitcoin is being used in the background.

Paul is getting a lot of media attention for his book. This is a rare interview where he gets time to go deep into the subject.
