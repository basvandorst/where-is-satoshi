What this gang of hoodlums will do, is first buy all cheapy sold BCC coins that BTC owners will drop as soon as the fork hapends. Than they'll wait untill segwit2x is due and when it won't happen they'll have an excuse to switch. First the whole lot will drop all their BTCs causing a massive drop and buy all that BCCs pumping it sky high... Hash power will follow... there you have it gents... a conspiracy theory that makes sense... china wants control and they got the $$$ The smart thing the community should do, is to prepare itself for something like this, not scream shit coin and open worthless polls while they laugh at us. They ain't dumb. They're very smart. And by the look of things, the're one step ahead.

I agree and that is a real concern - in the short term. But in the long run both currencies will grow as crypto market expands. And it will expand.
