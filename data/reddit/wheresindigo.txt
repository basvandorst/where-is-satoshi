You only pay taxes on the profit, so it would be 20% of 5k and he'd have 91.5k left after taxes.

coinbase isn't censoring anyone
@_date: 2018-06-16 23:12:29
but it is full of nazis
@_date: 2018-06-17 00:53:19
facebook and twitter can't close their bank accounts but they can ban their fb/twitter accounts for violating their TOS. that isn't censorship
@_date: 2018-06-17 01:10:28
you're conflating the actions of several entities with the actions of a single entity. coinbase is just saying that they won't do business with them, which is fully within the rights of coinbase
refusing to associate with a person is not censorship.
a person's right to free speech does not obligate any private entity to provide them with a platform.  that would obviously be a violation of the private entity's own rights

Gab is a bunch of nazi edgelord losers. Good for coinbase
@_date: 2018-06-17 03:01:09
you're confusing something fundamental about the right to free speech and the first amendment. it is not just about freedom of expression, but also freedom of association--we can assemble and form clubs and groups without interference from the government.
an element of freedom of expression is that we have the right to choose who we do and do not associate with. we can form groups, clubs, associations, and parties of our own choosing, and we can exclude people from those groups if we don't like them. there are a few limitations to this (see the fourteenth amendment, civil rights act, etc) but none of those limitations apply in this case.
the freedom of association is intrinsically tied to freedom of expression. coinbase has no obligation to associate with gab, and gab's right to free speech as guaranteed by the first amendment is *not* affected by coinbase's decision to dissociate from gab.

Refusing to do business with someone is not censorship.
@_date: 2018-06-17 00:05:15
yeah they made that against the rules but there is still a lot of that stuff on there and it's trivially easy to find. in 10 seconds i found a meme of a jewish person being burned in an oven by a person wearing a swastika armband
gosh why would coinbase not want to do business with them
@_date: 2018-06-16 23:13:58
nazi twitter
@_date: 2018-06-17 02:45:30
gab's coinbase account *is* an individual account (meaning, an account belonging to an individual entity). how many people use gab's service is not important
whether coinbase 'should' have done it is irrelevant to the question of whether banning gab from coinbase is censorship. it's not, for the reasons i've explained. coinbase has the right to dissociate from gab for any reason they want, whether it was because of the content on gab or some other reason
@_date: 2019-12-10 12:46:30
yeah that's why we overthrow every democratically elected left-wing government in other countries the first chance we get
@_date: 2019-12-10 16:34:33
oh i see so undermining democracy in other countries is just fine

AML laws are good
@_date: 2018-03-05 17:00:00
Yeah those things are why we have AML/KYC laws. Those laws make it more difficult for criminals to operate without being caught. Do you think we should repeal AML/KYC laws?
@_date: 2017-09-17 13:12:28
You use public infrastructure and enjoy the safety that a stable government provides but won't pay your share? Doesn't sound like the government's stealing from you.
@_date: 2018-03-05 17:39:10
it isn't thoughtcrime even by a stretch
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:17:21
lol what
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:18:37
A long time, probably.
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:13:24


Doesn't really work this way, considering that moneyed interests enjoy disproportionate representation in the government.
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:02:50
terrorism, illegal arms trafficking, fraud, bribery, etc.
money laundering is used to hide money related to all of those things
it honestly blows my mind that people on here are sincerely arguing that AML is bad
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:20:16
Okay dude I'll come stay in your house and eat your food, but I won't pay you rent. Requiring me to pay rent is theft and if you evict me then you're just using the state's threat of force to pay you (extortion).
@_date: 2017-09-17 21:10:50
People crying about taxes is the most lol thing to me. You and your children get 12+ years of education, roads, bridges, sewage, water, police, national defense, etc. It's not theft.
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:09:11
That has no relation to whether it's fair or not.
@_date: 2018-03-05 17:41:38
How do you catch people laundering money without AML/KYC laws? The entire point of AML/KYC laws is to make it difficult to hide money laundering.
I already explained how AML law protects the public.
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:28:08
TA works, but not like that.

The law regarding MSBs actually includes "stored value" in addition to other instruments like checks, money orders, etc. That would apply to crypto, precious metals, gems, etc.
@_date: 2017-09-17 22:03:15


Everyone will lol at you and that will be that. But I suppose that if everyone in your neighborhood decided that they wanted you to own and govern the property, then they could transfer it to you. Or maybe you could convince them to join a homeowner's association and elect you as president.
You use public property, public services, and public utilities, and you enjoy the rights that are guaranteed by the government, but you seem to reject any responsibilities you have as a citizen. Taxation isn't theft, it's a responsibility, and we all have a say (though our fractional representation is small) in how much we are taxed and how our taxes are used.
@_date: 2018-03-05 17:15:27
From FinCEN:
















"Stored value" seems to be a key term that would apply to crypto.
If you were dealing only with gold and USD, you're still a money services business.
