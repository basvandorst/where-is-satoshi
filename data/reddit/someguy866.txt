1. Wallet from my computer
2. Yes within 2 to 3 minutes
3. I believe this is my address, but I'm basing it off my BTC-e withdraw. My wallet is on my home computer which is not available to me right now. 1JugJe1Z2dbUEA67aZKCGF65jr21zoQYr I'm confused though because the .8341 was sent to TD and the .1348 is still my wallet although it shows as spent?
4. Waiting to get home tonight to confirm the transaction
5. Tiger Direct claims they processed $250,000 dollars of orders in 24 hours and their doesn't seem to be any complaints. Why is my order struggling? 
I believe it will get worked out once I provide sufficient evidence that I paid. However when you spend a lot of time trying to earn these bitcoins and then spend nearly all of them only to find out something went wrong it's frustrating. I'm venting and letting others know that not all these transactions are going smoothly. Others probably had no issues and enjoyed the convenience of paying with bitcoin, just for me this was not the case.

Fortunately I snapped a pic of the completed order and sent that to them. Unfortunately that picture doesn't include the bitcoin addresses so I have to go get them tonight. Nice to know it cleared up for you and I'm not the only one.

As I feared I will post the actual transaction tonight

Looks right. TD uses bitstamp correct?

I want to buy more if I can get this worked out. Did your order ever say "Pending B2B OA Process"?

Lol I'll admit I switched to Newegg years ago, but with the bitcoin acceptance I was like ok I'll give it a try and here we are.

Such as? I sent bitcoins to Tiger Direct given the provided address in the checkout. I made the payment and the payment was confirmed as payed. Now two days later they are telling me they're still confirming the payment, except I sent bitcoins that I no longer have. So TigerDirect has my bitcoins yet I don't have a graphics card.

Here's the correct one guess I accidently deleted a character. Still going to check tonight.
