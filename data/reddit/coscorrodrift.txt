there's probably thousands of people that have like 100 bucks in hella coins and holding
that post is interesting as hell though, the dude really puts an effort, i enjoyed the comparisons of the portfolio against full BTC and that

Multiplying your investment by a factor of fucking 1200 is insane lmao i would have 0 regrets. still would think "damn, what if" but multiplying just 100 bucks times 1200 is 120k lmfao

What I fail to understand of this answer is in the real world, who was the first or the first people to accept BTC, who saw the potential usefulness without the fear that it would crash or not work, and why did they do that. From what I have read it seems it was the guy that bought a pizza for fun I suppose. My theory (it has lots of flaws though) is that the anonymity atracted criminals and that kind of people, and made it popular to buy illegal stuff

WHAT??? That's not how it works, that is absolutely wrong. Please, think about it. That's one of the things it's so popular.

IIRC the fees are pretty high if you pay by card, if you pay using like the weird XX32 32131 31231 numbers there's less fees
