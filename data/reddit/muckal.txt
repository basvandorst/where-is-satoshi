You misunderstand, but it is a conversation for another time.

Calling me a statist when I explore obvious possibilities of how the government can use blockchains to gain further control only shows your apparent confirmation bias.

First of all, if you want to have a discussion about the future, you must avoid using the word never.  There are very few instances where never actually applies and it certainly doesn't in your examples.
  
Change is inevitable and in some ways desirable and it will probably happen.  The examples I put forth are just that, examples, and there are many examples I can come up with, I've just listed a few vague ways the government can extend their control using blockchains.
  
As time goes on and regulations and laws are put forth as well as systems in which to enforce and audit compliance, the bitcoin blockchain will be enumerated.  It is happening right now.  Every american institution that uses it is helping with this endeavor and it is being normalized.  Merchants are a part of this and eventually, your weed supplier may choose to comply and operate in the clear because that is what the majority wants, because normalization results in the majority.  You may find that bitcoin no longer serves your desires.
  
Time is not on your side when it comes to the bitcoin blockchain, but your desires are very clear and people will try to cater to them, but make no mistake that there will be consequences associated with your choices.  Right now, it is new and systems of control are just coming to fruition, and this will accelerate over time and almost completely take over the system.

The government can force banks to track their securities using a blockchain.  By mandating that banks use a ledger they can audit in real-time, along with controls and tracking through digital signing and multisig, they can see what institutions are doing with the money they issue **in real-time** and who is responsible for it along the way.  And they can still have control over it at the institution using multi-signature.  They cannot do this with cash because the trail can only be tracked so far and they rely on archaic imaging systems to track where cash ends up at banks and that doesn't show the complete picture of who touched it both at the bank and by the consumer.  They also have to trust that institutions are tracking it internally in a way that can be audited and it is not in real-time.
  
For instance, lets say a consumer has a casascius coin they acquired anonymously at some point and then they decide to cash it in and use it, either by selling it to a company like coinbase or at a merchant.  Eventually that will end up going through a banks blockchain and it will be tied to a user, that users identity will be enumerated and they will be able to track it through the banks(governments) blockchain to its exit on the bitcoin blockchain.  This will help them enumerate who is using the blockchain and how they are using it.  They can track entry and exit and probably a lot more over time through regulation.

Bitcoin is as malleable as the majority wants it to be.  And I'm not saying that cant change.
@_date: 2015-03-12 21:07:05
I like your optimism, unfortunately it is too expensive for me to embrace.
@_date: 2015-03-12 22:31:47
Please cite where most start-ups have stalled or left New York as a result of regulation.
  
Your second example is flawed, but I'm seeing you do not have capacity for this so I am losing interest.
@_date: 2015-03-12 21:25:34
You didn't argue anything, you demonstrated some of the realities of today while I demonstrated some of the possible and very probable realities of tomorrow.  You need to refute the possibilities I put forth if you want to debate.  There is no insurance against change.

The answer to your question depends a lot on the identity of the central authority issuing it.  The article is intellectually dishonest.
  


  
Am I the only one who sees the issues here?

Your example of people moving to less stringent regulatory environments is just normalization in slow motion, the regulation will meet them as systems of control grow and spread and our governments become more intertwined and cooperative.
  
Your example that you think is common sense, isn't.  Because when the majority complies, you become an outlier and thus cannot operate in the open without building a pattern that can be seen.
  
For instance, if you continue to evade and continue to be the source of darknet coins, you will be seen and you will be watched and scrutinized.  And authority will eventually get around to you if you are doing more harm than good in terms of information gathering on the part of government intel.  It will become harder and harder for you to operate and obtain anonymous coins.  Eventually, like I said, bitcoin may no longer serve your desires and you will comply or abandon it.  I think you will comply in one way while seeking to satiate your anonymous desires using other systems.  Like I said, people will try to serve your desires if there is profit and they will use systems that allow it at an acceptable risk to themselves.  
  
Bitcoin introduces many opportunities for control and it is ignorant to believe those opportunities won't be explored.

They need to demonstrate concern in order to justify and introduce systems of control.
@_date: 2015-03-12 22:04:31
I'm not going to debate you if you're going to lie.  The majority **does** want to comply with their government because the majority does not identify with the state as you have.  Whether you like it or not, you are in the minority.
  
I demonstrated how compliance is being normalized and explained that normalization results in the majority.  Do you refute this?  If so, please present an example of how you will remain anonymous in a system where the majority complies.

It is and is amazes me how many people refuse to see it.  One would think that if a government can disable corrupt bankers by forcing them to use a medium they can track, that people would be for that.  There is too much trust in the current system, not just for consumers, but from the governments perspective too.  We are constantly hearing about them coming down on banks like HSBC, and it is only after the crime is done and the books have been white-washed.  Prosecutions rarely happen because the perpetrators have too much ability to cover their tracks, so they levy a fine and move on.  With digital signing, it is very clear who is responsible for moving what and systems of control can be extended deep into the institution itself.  This is a good thing!

Governments can access the blockchain the same as consumers and they can use it to extend their control into institutions that use it(and they may be forced to in some way).  This will cripple corrupt institutions and enumerate consumers along the way.  Do not kid yourself, the blockchain doesn't care who you are and will serve whoever chooses to use it.

Right now, government intel can only track cash so far and they rely on centralized and possibly corrupt banks to comply with compliance.  With bitcoin, the potential for tracking is immense and they can audit what centralized banks who use it provide using the open ledger without having to place trust in them.  They can achieve through regulation what they never could with cash and centralized ledgers.  
  
They do not have to give up the power to issue money, they can use the best of both worlds.  I expect they will eventually issue their own digital currencies too and will track exchange between the two using their own ledgers in conjunction with the open ones.
