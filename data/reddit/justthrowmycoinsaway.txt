I'm not vocal about crypto, and I don't know what anyone would have to report me about as even the people that do know about it know that I pay my taxes. It seems they are just targeting certain coinbase/pro users that sell above a certain threshold.

I am another that has received the 6174-A yesterday. I fudged the trades on my 2017 tax return accidentally but filed an amended return a couple months afterwards with the correct transactions/gains and it was eventually reviewed and accepted. I did not sell at all 2014-2016, or 2018, so I can only assume it's from my 2017 return. 
After receiving the notice I triple checked that all my trades were accounted for on the amended return, they are in fact correct, and I used bitcoin.tax for my capital gains report. 
So yeah I'm another person that is pretty confused and worried. Even though I am positive I've filled out everything correctly to the best of my knowledge, I would think if anything I would receive the 6174 "soft notice". Or perhaps they view the fact that I filed an amended return as suspicious enough to warrant the 6174-A? I'm really not sure. 
I just know I spent all last night and this morning combing through all my documents and prior tax returns to check everything is accurate. I CERTAINLY don't hope the IRS is viewing withdrawals from coinbase to an external wallet as a sale because that's just preposterous. 
I wish the letter was more specific or at least give us a year in which they may have found discrepancies, but it's certainly not a great feeling thinking they may try to come after me when I feel like I've done everything correctly. I've very much been a stickler in trying to do things correctly for the very reason that I know virtual currency holders are likely a red flag in the eyes of the IRS.
EDIT: I should also add that I do not believe I was part of the Coinbase summons. I was never notified by Coinbase about it (I believe you were sent an email if they had to hand over your info?) and I don't think I qualified for the summons requirements since I didn't use Coinbase/GDAX/Coinbase Pro much until 2017. Which makes it even more confusing as to why I'm one being targeted with this letter. Before then I mostly used Bitstamp but gains were always reported and taxed.

Things are going up or down tonight. Very fair assessment.

Oh, please. What kind of safe space do people need these days that the word "Bcash" is considered a derogatory slur? That's insane. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:06:44
Except Bcash isn't a negative connotation or showing a low opinion whatsoever. The only reason some people are considering it a "lack of respect" is because they're being so touchy about people using a nickname but the word in itself is not an insult. I'm glad some people have the sense of mind to say "who gives a shit what we call it" instead of calling it a derogatory slur of all things.

@_date: 2017-12-07 21:54:39
The IRS does not know trade details unless the taxpayer puts them on their taxes except in cases like the coinbase order recently where they're ordered to hand over specific transaction details. It's up to you to report specifics in trades and purchases, though I'm sure they could find out if you give them a reason enough to dig.

How is the futures price of gold you set not speculation on the future price of gold though? A price of $110 would be under the assumption/prediction that gold is going to continue going up, correct?
I guess I'm not following but you seem much more versed than I am. My head is spinning lately trying to understand all of this.
If Bitcoin is $1000 and a future for next year is $1500, I don't understand how that price isn't a bet on the future price.

How hard is it to easily send cash to a relative in another country? How much does it cost and how many loops (transaction fees, bank fees, currency conversion fees) do you have to jump through? 
In the long, LONG scheme of things, a digital currency would have profound implications on how we treat money. Are we close to the point where you can send bitcoin to a relative in another country and they can easily spend it without those same loops? Not yet, and not for a long time...but yes, that does seem to be a goal for the future. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:21:47
I don't know, I guess I just am having too much trouble with this. Sure maybe some people know enough to influence the price of bitcoin enough to generally know what it will be in a year, but most won't know, and therefore I don't see how futures trading for them is not predicting future price. I know that's what you just tried explaining, but I don't think I'm going to understand what you mean unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:37:05
Your co-worker doesn't know what they're talking about. All trades gain or loss are tax events that need reporting. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:35:56
I understand better, I guess. It almost seems like semantics to say the current price is an estimate on the future price, but futures aren't an estimate on future price. I don't understand that but its making more sense when you say futures price is based on information we have currently and no future information.
I don't know if theres a Futures for Dummies or something out there like it but fuck me, I don't remember the last time I've had so much difficulty understanding things that seem like they should be simple to understand. Thanks with the help trying to grasp this though.

What level of risk are you comfortable with? Are you comfortable with higher risk, higher reward? Then trade it for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:49:57
FIFO is probably easiest. The first coins you buy are the first ones you sell.

It's easy to apologize when you're alone in your safe space again away from the big meanies that would call your precious scam Bcash.

Bitcoin has a $155 billion market cap already. If Cuban put ALL of his net worth of say $3 billion into bitcoin, he would own 2%. And there's not a chance in hell he's putting all of it in anyways, though he undoubtedly owns some.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:58:01
How can anyone have respect for this guy? He exploded with the "I'm richer than you, PLEB" insults because someone called "bitcoin cash" bcash (which it should be anyways)? Holy shit. He's one of the last people I'd ever trust.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:04:37
They're lost forever and the other coins increase in value. If it hypothetically got to a point where all but, say, 1 bitcoin were considered lost, it can be divided even further than  8 decimals to accomodate the necessary wider audience.

I guess I can see the benefit in certain situations. I don't know if I would consider it the best option for most people, though. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:43:08
How so? The longer you owned the coins the greater probability of meeting long term capital gains tax requirements.

@_date: 2017-11-29 05:15:43
What do you mean? You keep track of when you bought any bitcoins, and then when you sell any bitcoins. As far as worrying about the specific coins "mixing" in the wallet and not knowing if you're sending the same coins you bought? It doesn't matter with FIFO, you just use whatever coin was your first purchased coins and continue from there.
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:59:59
Acting like your positive it will crash or positive it will go up seems delusional to me. Two sides of the same coin.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:50:42
Are you not just putting off the inevitable of selling the first coins? You'll have to pay that tax either way eventually, while unable to take advantage of the LTCG tax if you do LIFO. I understand some advantage short term. Not so much long term.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:59:20
Correct. I more or less meant if he already had his net worth in bitcoin, not necessarily he planned on putting it all in tomorrow.
