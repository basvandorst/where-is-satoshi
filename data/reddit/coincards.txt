If you're willing to go the gift card route (if you're going to be spending at stores we offer it might work out better and cheaper anyways), we offer cashouts within 2 confirmations at

If your looking to go through a stores checkout process (using btcpay), we have Amazon gift cards enabled for as low as a $1 with lightning network. 
We did this to allow users to be able to play with real value at low risk and still get something back :)

In the USA, Our service allows for Uber cards of any denomination between $15 - $150 including down to the cent. 
I would say though, if you have a service you are using repeatedly, you are going to want to load it less often to avoid transaction fees unless you are using the lightning network. 
I'm also not sure if uber will "post" charge your trip or look for your account to see if you have enough credits to cover the trip. This could be a bit tricky to calculate.
@_date: 2019-07-15 20:15:58
 and trade it for a gift card for something you can use. Amazon, Xbox/PSN, Uber Eats, pretty much anything you can think of :)

Hey there, we run Coincards.com and think we can be a helpful place in your journey. 
We actually started 5 years ago to solve this very problem. We noticed there was no places to actually spend your crypto (or very few) so we started partnering with merchants directly through their gift card programs. 
We've now got hundreds of direct partnerships, both in the USA and Canada and are expanding rapidly. We actually talk with merchants, pushing BTC adoption as something we want them to accept directly. Ultimately we want to be obsolete, and merchants accepting directly. Until then we get to show the merchants just how much demand there is for BTC payments. 
We are lightning network enabled and have a huge selection. Check us out if you have a chance :)
@_date: 2019-07-11 03:52:41
No, we have very minimal information requirements
@_date: 2019-07-28 07:10:14
You'll likely need to post it on paxful or localbitcoins. Really risky to whoever buys your gift card. No real legit services offer this that we are aware of.
@_date: 2019-07-11 03:17:32
Thanks for the mention! 
Coincards needs a lightning symbol though. We've been lightning enabled since early 2018 :)
@_date: 2019-07-20 00:07:51
Coincards.com :)
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:25:22
 has offered hundreds of gift cards for lightning for over 1.5 years.
@_date: 2019-07-18 20:21:59
Thanks for listing us on your spreadsheet! 
We are very transparent about our rates and we offer true face value of all of our cards in the USA and a large portion of those in Canada. Our rate is based on Krakens spot rate and we do not build buffers into our exchange rates to "hide" the costs of our cards. We beleive in full transparency, part of why we have been in bitcoin for the last 5+ years. 
As mentioned, all of these rates are probably lightning network transactions on which some of our competitors give a 2% discount. We are confident that our on-chain pricing is very competitive and would likely show us as a clear winner on a similar on-chain chart. 
That being said, we love being included on all lightning enabled charts and listings. We have had lightning enabled since March 2018, making us one of the first stores to enable it. 
@_date: 2019-07-19 01:01:06
You could try us, Coincards.com 
We have hundreds of gift cards for BTC that you can take to stores and spend no matter what age.
@_date: 2019-07-27 01:46:30
Idiot might be a harsh word but we agree with this that spending is a needed activity ;)
We've been pushing Bitcoin adoption at Coincards.com in Canada for years and recently expanded into the states as well. 
You'd be surprised how receptive big merchants are now becoming to the idea of Bitcoin (they won't take it directly yet) but if everyone begs merchants for adoption but then becomes unwilling to spend and show volume, the merchants become uninterested.
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:29:26
You can also check us out at  
We've been around for 5 years, lightning enabled, non-custodial and no KYC and hundreds of merchants across North America (USA and Canada)
@_date: 2019-07-11 15:13:53
Just an FYI on this, we are very transparent about our fees. We use Kraken's spot rate to calculate fees and it is updated every minute. 
We do not hide any fees within our products pricing so you are paying exactly what the market rate is at the time of ordering. 
Typically this means we are cheaper than our competitors but depending on spikes in those rates it might slightly differ.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:27:41
If anyone wants to beta test our new site, email me at admin
@_date: 2018-09-27 15:20:01
Yes, it supports both Clightning and LND
@_date: 2018-08-09 19:47:03
Good for you!
Spend and Replace! Support BTC accepting merchants! 
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:11:18
There are some videos on how to do this, although they might be a bit dated now as BTCPay gets so many updates in a day. 
Basically, you'll want to clone NBXplorer and BTCPay from github, checkout of the latest releases and then run both. You might need custom parameters depending on your setup but I believe the --help command will show you your options. 
If you need more help, I suggest coming into the slack channel for BTCPay:

This is the default for most .ca domains. CIRA automatically sets the default to blocked. That being said my home address is my business address and although I have nothing to hide, I do not want my home address published publicly. 


They take bitcoin for their hosting plans. Why wouldn't I use them? =\


This is a pretty quick conclusion but I hope that my participation in this thread can help with with any fears of my services being a scam. This is one customer whom I have tried to communicate with but for whatever reason my emails have not gone through. I will work with him directly as I now have his reddit username. 


Actually my local RCMP would be the Surrey Detachment. I am definitely reachable by that phone number however if anyone has any concerns. 
I am not here to scam anyone, I am here to try to build a legitimate business. I am active and known in the Vancouver bitcoin community and I am sure anyone from the community would be able to vouch for me. This seems to have been a miscommunication which can now be fixed through reddit. :)
@_date: 2014-08-21 21:29:07
I'll be there :D
@_date: 2014-07-31 17:22:37
Actually according to Costco:
"Members and non-members may use the Costco Cash Cards to shop at any Costco location in Canada, the United States, Puerto Rico and online on Costco.ca or Costco.com.
I am not sure how the amount is calculated in the USA and have not used it for this. I can definitely look into this further.
We would only be able to deliver to a Canadian address though. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 06:50:20
I can only get 6 Letters and a space where i'm from. Makes it hard to get "bitcoin". 
Was thinking of doing "BTC FTW" or "WOW BTC" if i ever get around to it. Would sure love the ability for 7 letters. 
@_date: 2014-08-22 19:05:25
Awesome! :D
Let us know if we are missing anything you might want to see! 
@_date: 2014-07-30 23:25:46
WE don't load the cards. We acquire the cards and have them sent via email or post depending on the cards :)
@_date: 2014-10-10 02:24:36
Yes, I am getting the same. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 16:45:31
Can you please check your spam folder? 
We have sent you 3 emails in regards to this order and asked for a final confirmation as to which card you wanted. We did not hear back from you, hence why the order is still in "Pending". 
Please let us know via email ASAP and we will get your order processed. 
@_date: 2014-07-30 23:28:49
Some of these exchanges are very hard to get setup with and require verifications and information. 
We allow for checkout on emailed gift cards as an anonymous guest using only your email address and no verification. If you need the card shipped to a friend or relative or are purchasing a physical card, we still only require the mailing address but no registration is required.
Thanks! 
@_date: 2014-08-05 17:51:14
Got the official reply from Costco:
The cards can be used at all locations and on the websites as indicated. If you shop in the US, you will be charged the exchange rate of the day in the US.
@_date: 2014-09-27 16:51:12
Actually this isn't one of my accounts.. lol
@_date: 2017-02-13 05:12:14
Single SKU? 
You could setup a single page domain with your book and something like a mycelium gear or BitPay integration.
You could also try via Shopify as I think they have BitPay integration. 
@_date: 2014-09-04 07:07:13
It's Legit. I heard about it 2 weeks ago. 
Here you can see Anthony Di Iorio, and Michael Perklin talk about C4. Starts at about 28:40 and is from a Beam in session at decentral bangtown in Vancouver on August 14. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 19:49:03
I thought I'd chime in on this process. It seems a bit tedious to pay certain bills for me anyways. Brawker definitely is an interesting service and good for some things, but for others I would consider higher risk especially in the creative ways you managed to get it done ;). 
Personally I would have paid the telus bill using bylls.com as this is a way easier process in my eyes. I have used bylls to pay several of my recurring bills and never had an issue. 
Rent is a huge risk, especially with emt. Don't be fooled in thinking that EMT is a foolproof payment method. It can be reversed by the banks and because of this has become a very high risk payment method on localbitcoins. Unfortunately there isn't a better alternative for this however. Perhaps there is a market looking to be tapped into. 
Love watching your videos and this experience. Keep up the good work :) 
@_date: 2017-02-24 16:57:01
Sounds kinda like onecoin... 
@_date: 2017-02-13 03:55:37
Would someone actually meet you for $5? I wouldn't lol
@_date: 2016-01-06 03:39:22
Thanks for using our service! We are working on the fee, trust me I would like to get it down as well ;)
@_date: 2015-01-05 02:55:49
Awesome idea. Where's a good place to get one? 
@_date: 2017-02-13 03:58:35
Same wallet, but BitPay has Integration for their debit card. 
Copay is used as the "development" branch of the app and fully open source.  
@_date: 2015-01-29 21:04:16
much guests, 
such investment
@_date: 2015-01-05 02:53:33
Worked out to be about $24 after shipping to Canada. Already looked into this one lol
@_date: 2014-09-04 18:22:08
I love this video. It does a REALLY good job at capturing the vancouver bitcoin meetup group
@_date: 2016-01-17 08:20:05
I know this thread is a month old, but I just wanted to say thank you for using our service and I am glad that we could help you with something like this in a time of need. 
Hopefully things are getting better for you! 
@_date: 2017-03-30 03:39:17
What about coinbase?
You could also try paxful. 
@_date: 2016-01-06 03:40:04
Thanks for using our service! I appreciate the kind words and I'm glad it got someone interested in bitcoin :)
@_date: 2019-03-10 23:43:14
Our credits are CAD, but if you are a Canadian it's a perfect fit :) 
We also accept lightning ;)
@_date: 2017-03-28 17:18:26
Since when do 16 seperate entities make a central authority? What about the BTU dev team? Aren't there only 10 devs that make decisions? Does that make them a central authority?    
@_date: 2017-01-19 21:39:39
Ive used BitPay because they usually have integration with everything and it's easy to use. Also have used coinpayments.net, as they offer altcoins too. 
Checkout mycelium gear too. No fees and straight to your wallet. This might work better with your service. 
@_date: 2019-08-02 20:54:58
Fyi, Mogo doesn't allow Bitcoin to be withdrawn. 
This is only an ad for a company that will allow you to buy/sell within their wallet based on price but no chance of owning your Bitcoin purchased through them. 
Not your keys, not your Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-09 18:33:59
How old is this article? And why doesn't it actually link to where you can buy it? All I found was a wholesale page to buy a full pallet but they were "sold out"
Looks like their indiegogo campaign is closed, and their twitter account hasn't tweeted in 6 months. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 21:53:08
Awesome, Thanks for the feedback! 
Make sure to leave a product review on the item you purchased on Coincards.ca too :) 
@_date: 2019-08-10 14:47:16
We see about 2% of our volume for payments coming in at Coincards.com going through lightning. 
We find people are using it when they want to skip confirmations and just want something now while paying with BTC.
@_date: 2019-06-29 22:50:34
I believe so. They don't really understand the need for items like the Trezor to be segregated. We ended up being cut off from Amazon for having Fake inventory, yet all of our original inventory has been sold off at half the price. When we got the inventory sent back to us, there were Chinese markings all over it.
@_date: 2019-06-29 22:52:39
"Sold by Household Trends" is what I see. 
@_date: 2019-02-05 03:16:29
When you get to the point where you would be upset if you lost it all, stop buying. 
@_date: 2019-06-29 20:52:23
Don't do it. 
We used to resell Trezors on Amazon. 
The issue is that they mix ALL resellers stock into a single location in their warehouse. When someone sends them stock, it's mixed with the current stock. When they sell an item, it could be yours or another resellers. This gets really bad when Amazon accepts a shipment of fakes. You could in theory be ordering from an original reseller, but getting stock of the fake guys, again because they aren't segregated. 
Buy directly from a reseller, or Trezor themselves.
@_date: 2019-12-02 18:36:30
You can use [Coincards.com]( to exchange your BTC for gift cards to hundreds of vendors in Canada and the US, including gas, groceries, restaurants, gaming, mobile topups and more!

Send me an email to admin and I will see what I can do for you :)
@_date: 2017-04-07 06:01:52
Have you considered any of the flexipin options? You basically buy a flexipin as a gas station or corner store for cash, then use someone like netcoins or mybtc.
Again I'm not sure what they require, but should be minimal when buying with a voucher. 
@_date: 2017-04-13 04:26:28
You might have some luck on paxful or localbitcoins
@_date: 2019-04-21 16:20:43
You could try openbazaar
@_date: 2017-04-07 05:33:00
You can checkout our service if your looking to spend your coins at stores, such as for food and gas. We have a guest checkout option. 
@_date: 2017-04-16 23:38:37
I sell Starbucks and Tim Hortons gift cards for Bitcoin daily. People are still using Bitcoin to buy lots of stuff
@_date: 2019-01-14 02:02:00
Yup, it's been there for years actually! Good way of getting your games, too bad they use bitpay though :( 
@_date: 2018-03-02 19:43:18
Awesome guide! 
We've been using this project since early January, and it has been the easiest and most stable version of any payment processor we have used to date. 
Controlling your keys and running your own node as a business is becoming more and more crucial! 
All serious bitcoin businesses should be looking at this as a viable solution! 
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:18:22
If you're in Canada, check out Coincards.ca!
@_date: 2017-09-08 00:03:02
Hey there, 
We run a Bitcoin to gift card exchange service which you might find useful:  
Also, if your going to be staying in town for a while, make sure to come hang out at Vancouvers decentralization hub, DCTRL. We have a ton of events, chats and hangouts every week. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:08:18
Yup, this is solid advice. 
In 2014, we built Coincards.ca for Canadians with the same thoughts as OP. 4 years later, we are busier than ever even with the massive dips. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 16:12:59
We use BTCPay which is fully open-source.
@_date: 2019-09-27 22:51:18
Good to hear, we've got nothing but respect for Bitrefill even though techinically they are a competitor. 
We run  :)
@_date: 2019-09-27 20:41:26
This usually only happens when you're adding LOTS of money into a single account or money to another account that's not in your country. 
We've seen this issue a few times as well, but the vendor should be able to correct this for you if they have a direct relationship with Amazon.
@_date: 2018-07-20 16:14:21
Can confirm, we also accept Dogecoin and more people use it for payment than you would think. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 21:41:07
We offer Bitcoin, Lightning Network Payments, Litecoin, and Dogecoin through BTCPay. 
The platform is very intuitive and there is no indication we accept Bitcoin Cash. The only way to come to this conclusion is to mistake bitcoin, in 2 different places, for a bcash because the user does not know the difference if they have been scammed into thinking they are the same thing. 
We do allow for conversions to other coins through ShapeShift, like many other services do too.
The user from the twitter post was using the Bitcoin.com wallet, and was sending to our Bitcoin (BTC) wallet address. It should be the wallet software which warned him that this would not go through, not the payment processing software. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 22:26:06
If you are in Canada, You can also use  - We have been accepting Lightning payments for Amazon.ca plus a bunch of other cards for months now! :D
@_date: 2019-09-27 20:59:12
I'd reach out to Bitrefill, they can likely talk to their Amazon rep and get this fixed for you. 
Good luck, but don't shy away from some of us other providers! ;)
@_date: 2018-07-16 17:35:48
We fully believe that using ("spending") your BTC is what gives it value. And the more value that it is has, the more adoption that we will see across the board. 
BTC is about more than just it's value as a held asset. BTC is about economic change and financial freedom, and taking all of the power out of the hands of the few and transferring it to the many. 
@_date: 2018-07-16 17:27:08
Coincards.ca is a good option for Canadians looking to spend their crypto on their next holiday. We offer electronic and physical gift card options for flights, accommodations, food, and more! 
We were early adopters of BTCPay as our payment processor. We accept BTC, LTC and DOGE directly, and we have Shapeshift integrated into our site (allowing for payment in all other alt coins that Shapeshift accepts).
@_date: 2018-04-11 08:03:52
Hey there, 
This is actually why we suggest opening a channel to us directly. You can find our node info on the checkout process to do so easily. 
That way you ensure you are funding enough on your channel to make those payments :)
@_date: 2018-04-11 21:19:11
The limits will be increased once we see more adoption of lightning and it comes out of "Beta". Eventually we would like to remove all limits and have all higher valued orders be able to be processed through lightning. For now we are starting small :)
@_date: 2018-04-11 21:20:15
Yes, we only deal with CAD at the moment. 
No, Amazon.ca and other Canadian retailers will not load balances onto their US based websites. 
@_date: 2015-03-21 19:10:57
I have used 2 mastercards to purchase items for my business. Both have been cut off and closed without any reason except the following statement "We reserve the right to end relationships with any customers at any point". 
I am pretty sure that its somehow noted I run a bitcoin business and they keep closing my accounts. Not really sure what else would explain it. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 17:15:22
Hey there, We are definitely legitimate and still processing more orders than ever :)
You can see a list of our public reviews here as well: 
Lastly, if you are unsure of how our service works, we would suggest starting with a smaller amount which you can add to your amazon account as a trial. 
Have a good day! 
@_date: 2017-07-10 21:29:15
100% agree with you. 
Also, he could simply buy more BTC with the fiat he just saved on the flight ;) 
@_date: 2016-07-07 19:34:44
I honeslty haven't used coinbase in years. However my concern is making the level of entry alot higher for Canadians. 
Coinbase is huge in the US, and often one of the first sources bitcoin noobs start with. This might scare more people off. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:46:51
I just wanted to let you know that we are 100% open and alive. You can purchase Amazon.ca gift cards from us using your BTC, or other 40+ cryptos as well. 
If you have any questions, please feel free to PM me directly. 
Thanks! 
@_date: 2016-07-07 18:19:55
I don't believe that circle lets you add a Canadian bank account (I could be wrong), but i have used it in the past for Credit Cards buys. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 06:55:02
You could always try our service too: 
We exchange your bitcoin for Canadian gift cards. Lots of miners use our service! :)
@_date: 2019-05-02 00:27:00
 
Turn your BTC into Gift cards for the vendor's you will likely be spending at. Many of our top cards can be purchased at market rates with no fees and delivered within 2 confirmations.
@_date: 2017-06-23 00:13:22
They have been around for at least 3+ years in Canada and are a very useful service for paying your bills with Crypto. 
They are based out of the Bitcoin Embassy and Satoshi Portal in Montreal, run by a fairly well known face in the Canadian bitcoin scene. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 01:39:40
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:38:27
Its not exactly converting to Fiat, but we allow for converting BTC to gift cards at stores you might shop at anyways. Check us out: 
Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-06-14 00:01:53
Very cool! Way to spread the good word.
