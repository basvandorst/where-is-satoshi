WTF Man I'm sick of this shit. Just when I get excited and think we're finally getting out of this shit slump it drops. Jesus why can't the fucking imbeciles of the world realize how game changing this tech is and just get on board. It's a no brainer!

You don't think this could have evolved into BTC? The fact that they were tossing the idea of crypto currency around and then 12 years later an anonymous benefactor bestows bitcoin to the world. The elite have been wanting to get into global currency for a while now, the NSA wouldn't want the world to know that they created this digital token that bypasses banks but completely allows them to track every transaction. Not to mention the lack of backlash from the financial institution which bitcoin threatens the very existence of. One would think that governments and banks and every entity that stands to lose significant control would be focused solely on destroying this tech that allows people to have some sort of power. But here we are years after the white paper, old Gavin has been to speak with the CIA and not even so much as a ban on all crypto has come down. Its just strange to me. I'm big investor in BTC so I hope it's not the case but I wouldn't be surprised if it were.

I've gotten two people bitcoin as a gift. One, a family friend, I gave a flash drive that contained a multi-bit wallet. The other, my god son, I gave a Bitgo account controlled by his father. Not very creative, but I thought it'd be worth mentioning. Good luck.

It's not the poor that will turn to bitcoin in that time. They'll be mostly destitute. The rich however will want to preserve and protect every last outlaying dollar they have left, and they WILL turn to bitcoin. When the system gets back up and running (and I assure you it will) a new standard of transacting along with a new more stable currency will have an opportunity to take center stage. At least that's this mans apocalyptic prediction for the evening.

This is stupid to me. I literally just traveled from Memphis, to Toronto to Paris to Zagreb Croatia (where i'm writing to you from) with 100k in my carry-on with no problem. I declared and only had to answer any questions upon entering Canada. Exiting Canada Security questioned me, I showed them the form, no problem. That was it. No one else said a thing. This is a true recent story. 
PS - To add another level of risk to this, I'm a 29 year old black guy and I travel wearing a big cowboy hat.

Theoretically one would only need a portable wifi device thats not linked to your name. Maybe google could sell access to their Loon Global wifi for bitcoin. Anonymously. Just send the coins and get a code type of thing. 
@_date: 2014-11-14 22:05:56
I believe in the tech. It truly is revolutionary. If not BTC, then some equally disruptive tech will completely upend the system. Because of that and the fact that right now as you read this an infrastructure is being built by smart and greedy people alike, all over the world, to capitalize on the momentum that seems to only be gaining speed with each trolling comment, sarcastic snipe, price pump and price dump. You're witnessing the birth of a game changing protocol. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 20:27:07
My issue with Coinbase is that if the site goes down or is unavailable for any reason you lose access to your coins. I prefer cold storage.

Man i'm tired of articles like this. Bitcoin's year will be the year when the financial system collapses from over printing and people are forced to change the way they transact. Until then, I see nothing but a floating free fall for crypto. Like a feather from 1200ft.

This is the level we were at before the Coinbase pump. Always know that if the news isn't about a new class of buyers coming into the market that whatever highs we may reach are temporary and we will always return to the true value of the market. 
The only markets that sustain inflated overvalued prices are those that can be propped up by printing more of that currency.

I’m an economist. I don’t trade btc though. I’ve been hodling since before the MtGox fiasco. I honestly believe crypto to be the social and financial disruptive force that its founder(s) envisioned. I held through 2014 (with considerable pain and rektness after buying on the way up), and I’m hodling through this too. The long skew is the only thing that matters when you’re literally changing the world.

He who issues the money controls the money. There's roughly 1 million btc dormant right now in Satoshi's early wallets. If they ever come into the market, we're sunk. We don't control btc any more than Venezuelans control their currency. If the gov decides to dump millions on the market (which they have) they're sunk (which they are). Control is an illusion. Always has been. 
Edit: Hell we may be sunk already without satoshi's stash. Market bullies seem to only like to make money by suppressing the price.
