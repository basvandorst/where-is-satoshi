Every single year BTC skyrockets in November and Tanks leading up to Christmas.  Why?  Because people sell off some of their BTC for Christmas money.  It is the only predictable trend with BTC.  Every year.
I predict M$ will re-instate BTC payments in February or March when it has stopped it's incredible holiday volatility period.
The price of BTC is somewhat predictable based on mass psychology.  This subreddit is a great predictor of what trends are going to happen.  Thanks to all the HODL'ers out there BTC will steadily but surely rise, as the currency is being taken out of circulation and not being sold.  This drives the price up.  The main streaming of BTC at the end of last year is also going to drive the price up along with increasing volatility as new people investing are going to be more skiddish.  The advent and adoption of the Lightning Network and SEGWIT are also going to cause rises in BTC prices this year as it becomes adopted.  I wouldn't be surprised to see a lot of volatility with an overall increasing trend once Coinbase adopts SEGWIT sometime this year since it is the site that newcomers use.  
I wouldn't be surprised if these stories of M$ dropping BTC payment are the reason for today's dip.  We're going to see much more volatility on stories like this with all the new investors.  Every good story is going to bring massive boosts, every bad story is going to bring massive drops.  Just enjoy every time a bad story like this comes out and buy in the dip.
