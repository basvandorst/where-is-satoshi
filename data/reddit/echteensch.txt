What psychological effect do you expect?

Maybe it will go up or go down or roughly stay as it is.

There are not many ways to motivate those exchanges to do their job.
 1.  You wait until they upgrade their hardware and hire an adequate amount of people for their support. (Nobody knows how long this takes and wether they‘ll do it)
2. Wait patiently for your money to arrive.( Could be days. Could be weeks. Could be forgotten...by the computer. You don‘t need to have that much of experience to know that being nice and friendly to everyone isn‘t the best thing to do especially if it‘s about your money)
at all.)
3. Move your funds to a better exchange. (Choose a good exchange right from start and you‘ll never bother.   Especially if you life in Germany use bitcoin.de. I can send a referal link if anybody likes( it‘s just a few cents I get. ))
4. Write a post on reddit that seems to solve every major issue within hours.
These people help to protect your money.
These posts are a good indicator on which exchanges to shun. These posts help to let the exchanges understand that withdrawing is a must have and not a nice to have. 
Why do you want to get rid of the only lever they have available? Why do you want to let those people alone? Solidarity is the word.
Many more words could be said but well i have to fly...

Instead of complaining about all the bad exchanges on a daily basis search for something better? What‘s the challange?
