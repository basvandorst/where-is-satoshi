This is how *saving and investing* can impact your life.
@_date: 2019-07-26 00:10:46
Because of its capability in decentralized finance applications.
@_date: 2019-07-02 23:07:52
I support free speech. Part of free speech is being able to call others out for their shitty views and their hateful speech. Even if a platform has a decentralized design, if its user base is a bunch of hateful people, I have no desire or obligation to support it.  
It's insane to say that you can't support Bitcoin if you don't support gab.
@_date: 2019-07-03 02:51:37
Instead of endorsing the platform by using it, I'll stay away from it.  I have no interest in subjecting myself to those people any more than I already have.
@_date: 2019-07-03 02:49:31
I'm not a fan of racists, if that's what you mean.
@_date: 2019-07-02 20:40:04
Gab is a social network for racists and others too repugnant to last on mainstream networks

This is the stupidest shit I've ever seen lol.  Bye
@_date: 2019-07-04 00:53:27
I'm justifying racism because I'm against racism?  Also, where am I justifying hate?  I said I'm not a fan of racists, and I don't like platforms that have significant racist communities.  You think you're being clever, but you're really very lost.
@_date: 2019-07-02 23:11:20
Free speech is good but people that use it for hate are bad and seem to like to congregate on certain social media platforms

Go on, keep trying to justify racism.
@_date: 2019-07-02 23:14:47
Social media sites have no obligation to allow all speech. My problem with gab isn't that they allow free speech, my problem is primarily with the community that developed on gab. I'm choosing to use gab not because they allow free speech, but because racism and other hate is pervasive among it's users.

@_date: 2019-07-03 01:04:41

Inflation also makes it easier to pay off debt.  Would you want to take out a loan that gets more expensive over time?
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:20:24
Dude, I don't even know where to begin.  There's so many ways to approach this question, and my wife wants to go for a walk.  Just keep in mind the sheer size and scope of the banking industry.  How incredibly powerful and influential it is.  Think about how complex financial products and services are.  How are you going to issue mortgages, underwrite and perform actuarial analysis on insurance services, adjust monetary policy to influence the economy, etc etc.  I just think it's mind boggling stupidity to think that crypto can come in and replace all of this.  I think cryptos are here to stay, but as something complimentary to our existing system, and will likely get integrated to some degree into this system as well.
But the guys that drink the austrian economics kool-aide and see this as a new "gold" that'll finally bust the "banksters" and all that?  It's a joke.  There's simply no way, nor should we want that to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:29:57
There are two conflicting forces here.  People want to get rich off the value of cryptos going up, but people also want to be able to actually USE crypto currencies as a currency.  The problem is, without stability, they cannot function properly in trade.

People react very emotionally to changes in price.  Just in the past few weeks, we saw BTC above 9k and people were partying like we're going all the way to 20k.  Then it drops a bit to low 8k's, and BTC is done for, we're going to 5k, 3k, etc.
I don't recommend getting involved in crypto if you trade emotionally.
@_date: 2018-05-13 14:11:39

DCA instead from now on
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:20:36
I'm not sure why you're having trouble understanding this.  People actively make poor decisions all the time because they approach issues too emotionally.  DCA helps remove the emotional part so they don't end up panic selling and taking loss after loss when the price fluctuates.
@_date: 2019-02-02 03:01:38
It isn't
@_date: 2019-02-26 15:02:35
Probably. There's no real adoption yet so I'd be expecting a correction again.

At this point in time, custodial wallets are the easiest way to use LN on a mobile device. That will change as the technology improves though. But right now, you can simply download the app, send some BTC to it and start sending and receiving payments on your mobile device. No need to worry about opening channels or channel capacity etc. It's just ready to go. That's why people are making use of custodial wallets today. 
Hopefully when the tech improves, we'll have good noon custodial LN wallets on mobile.

I assume he's referring to Grin. It's not really a meme coin though. But it's based on mimblewimble and therefore purely privacy based and a pain to use. Mimblewimble should be added to BTC eventually if possible.

I'm always kind of shocked at how little people understand about software development.  The "18 months" meme regarding lightning network is so stupid.  Software takes time to build, especially if you're doing it right, and particularly when your software needs to be compatible with other implementations of the same standard.
@_date: 2019-02-08 18:32:15
It doesn't defeat the point. Most lightning transactions will be small amounts, so you should only have a small amount in a custodial wallet for convenience. 
You should still be keeping your main stack in a segwit wallet whose keys you control. 
@_date: 2019-02-06 19:30:58
Easiest way to get started is to use a custodial lightning wallet like bluewallet. Next easiest in my experience is ACINQ's eclair implementation of lightning. Check @_date: 2019-06-28 00:51:24

There are many reasons.  Imagine you want to hire someone to do some coding for you and not worry about which currency to pay them in, just use BTC. 
Think of all the data breaches that happen over the years.  Your debit/credit card info, etc all get stolen and passed around on the internet.  If you use BTC, there's nothing for them to steal.
If you're a merchant and you accept BTC, you don't have to deal with paying the CC company a % of your sale, and you don't have to worry about chargebacks, and you don't have to worry about securely keeping CC data in your systems.
These are just a few examples.

They can withdraw to a lightning network request. I've been using bluewallet, which is a custodial lightning network wallet on iOS (not sure if it's on Android too). Try it out.

I guess I should elaborate on "clunky".  It's the two on-chain transactions that require 3 confirmations each that slowed down the process (coinbase -&gt; bluewallet  segwit -&gt; bluewallet ln) 
Aside from that, it was really easy and smooth.  Now I'm playing around with the tip bot also...

No idea why people stress about using BlueWallet and Wallet of Satoshi.  Yes, they're custodial, but you wouldn't be putting your full stack there, just what you want to spend, particularly for microtransactions.  It's really convenient.  Try one of them out and hit up yalls.org or one of the gambling sites from  to see how nice it is.

Try using a custodial lightning wallet (bluewallet, wallet of satoshi etc) to see what LN is capable of.  It's an easy way to see how much more efficient LN is than expanded block size.

Not all bitcoin transactions are on chain.  Lightning network should reduce the need for so many on chain transactions consuming energy.
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:56:21
Since the average user won't know or care what path the transaction took to get to the recipient, when does a payment channel get closed and the transactions committed to the block chain? Does it happen automatically at a certain point?

In total it seems like a large amount of money, but it's nothing remotely close to a MtGox, and if people only keep $10 or so on there, it's no big deal at all.

I think the point is that Bitcoin's PoW is secure because of how widely mined it is.  There are significant mining pools all over the world that work on BTC.  However, if a new coin enters the market, and there's only a very small mining community for it, other mining communities with much bigger resources could perform a 51% attack on that new coin fairly easily.

No one is forcing you to use it. But if you wanted to test your LN node, y'all's is a great site for that. You can try many transactions for very very cheap. 
Besides being useful for testing LN, it's a concept for a site that gets revenue directly from users instead of ads. Clearly this model doesn't appeal to you though. I agree that it's a little cumbersome and most people probably prefer ads instead.

This way of sending BTC is a little different, you'd need a lightning wallet to withdraw it.  You can use bluewallet on iOS, that's the easiest I've found, and that will let you transfer it to a segwit wallet if you want.  Get bluewallet and follow the instructions that the lightning tip bot provides.

When the btc are sent to the lightning node, it hasn't registered into a receiving address yet, right? Is there a transaction registered on the blockchain when the btc are taken from the coinbase account?
Or is the transaction only posted to the blockchain after the lightning node commits it (closes the channel) ?

If an asset is in an obvious downtrend, it's not wise to keep holding it.  I think you understand this.  This is why it's just not good advice to say "HODL".  HODL is a meme, not investing strategy.  Now for a $100 investment, fine, buy it, throw it in cold storage, come back in 4 years and see if it's now $200.  But when you're talking about a more decent size investment, risk management needs to be taken into consideration.  Your rule  must not mean that you must accept any and all drop in value.
