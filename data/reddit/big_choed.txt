Played D1 basketball and got some money on the side from the team for food when they were playing away games... Took the money and bought some bitcoins through a money gram back when it was $15 and ended up with 15 bitcoins.... Traded on the first bubble and bought back ending with 25 bitcoins... Traded on this most recent bubble and now have 50 bitcoins... The goal is more bitcoins, not more money.

You obviously missed the point I was trying to make.... I didn't honestly think you could launder chucky cheese coins... The point is, there is no legal difference between a chucky cheese coin and a bitcoin. Both are not money and both should fall under the same legal restrictions. There is seriously no legal difference between monopoly money, chucky cheese coins, or bitcoins. AML is only required when you move money from point A to point B as a money transmitter. Bitcoin is a commodity which shouldn't require AML just like selling tomatoes doesn't require AML.

If you think Bitcoin will be as big as Facebook, then expect BTC to be upwards of $10,000 a coin. Do the calculations yourself.

Also, make sure you add:  
If you have a backup wallet.dat file and you exceed 100 transactions, your wallet.dat will start generating new change addresses. So your old wallet.dat file won't save your coins!!

**VERY IMPORTANT:**  
If you do more than 100 transactions on your wallet.dat file, it will send the change to newly generated BTC addresses... A backup wallet.dat won't have these new addresses. You need to keep a backup of the new wallet.dat file.

**Here's what their official overview is from [LINK](    
  
**Overview**  
Neo offers Cypriot residents depository and financial services. Customers can open demand deposit, savings, business, and merchant accounts. Though all customer deposits are held in full reserve in Bitcoin, many customers will use Euro-pegged accounts, allowing them to interact with their money like they would with Euro deposits at any traditional bank.  Accounts will also be available that offer full exposure to the Bitcoin price level. Regardless of which currency they bank in primarily, all customers can seamlessly deposit, withdraw, or transfer either Bitcoin or Euros. Neo simplifies Bitcoin usage, to enable simple, easy transfers without requiring understanding of the complex technology.  Neo will comply with all applicable financial and banking laws and regulations.  The Flagship Branch and second branch are both planned to open in February 2014.  
  
Bee is a payment processing network using EMV chip and PIN technology.  Bee offers lower transaction fees, faster settlement times, and higher security than competing payment processing services in Cyprus.  Merchant funds received through the Bee network are deposited directly into a Neo business account.  
  
Initial service offerings will target local Cypriot individuals and business customers.  As these ventures grow, service offerings will expand to all European Union territories.  
  
Neo is a depository institution offering many of the services provided by traditional banks, but with the additional benefits of Bitcoin integration and insulation from future EU Central Bank regulation. Initially, services will be offered to Cypriot banking customers only, though partnerships are currently being explored to expand services to all EU residents.  
  
Neo will provide customers with access to Bitcoin functionality without requiring understanding of the technological complexities. Though deposits are held in full reserve in Bitcoin, customers can deposit Euros or Bitcoins in and seamlessly withdraw or transfer either currency out. Each customer receives an 8-digit account number, allowing them to request payments much more easily than with Bitcoin’s 34-character public address.

Some people seem to think saving (hoarding) is bad... Savings is an intricate part of the market to gauge prices and to allocate resources properly. Under current Keynesian economic theory, our means of measuring markets (money) is changed abnormally causing a misallocation of resources.

Also, your question on "how many bitcoins do you own?" should reflect realistic numbers... less than 1% will have selected over 1000, yet there is half the check boxes for over 1000.... Most of the people are between 1 and 1000.

No, because those coins are still on Gox... Those coins haven't flooded the other markets yet. Just think of it from the perspective of somebody on Gox. If you had 100 coins on Gox at $200 wouldn't you take your coins and sell it on Bitstamp? Of course you would... And I don't think you would care what price it was as long as your money was out of Gox... Even more so if you could sell it $400 higher.

Cartels never survive too long, because it's too profitable not to be part of the cartel... If a cartel tries to raise prices above real market price, one business can get all the other business's customers at a closer to market price.... Cartel's only work if EVERY company agrees to it, and there is high barriers to entry for future competition.

I think that cryptocurrencies in general are the future. Whether it's Bitcoin or another coin that comes along.   
**Here's why it's going to be big in the coming years:**  
Every single currency around the world is printing money in endless supplies. When governments print money, people buy things that are finite in supply so the value doesn't decline (usually gold and silver). The problem with gold and silver, is that they are hard to trade. It's hard to trade gold dust at a supermarket. Cryptocurrencies on the other hand, are finite in supply and are easier to transact.... There is much that Bitcoin can offer as a utility as well that you can read about yourself (multisig transactions, ect.)  
  
The thing that gold and silver have over bitcoin is that there can be an endless number of crypto currencies but there can only be a finite number of elements. There may be another crypto currency of the future, but there can never be a new element in the periodic table.

The reason I hold bitcoin, is because the downfall of fiat currency will leave only hard currency and bitcoin for transactions. Bitcoin is gold that is transact-able.

In my opinion... I'd wait a little bit.  
Here are how things could most likely play out:  
**Scenario 1)** Gox reopens and allows you to withdraw BTC... People will be buying on Gox and selling at bitstamp/btc-e to get their money out of Gox.. This will drive the price up on Gox and down on all other exchanges.  
**Scenario 2)** Gox is insolvent and they they declare bankruptsy... A lot of people will get very upset and want nothing to do with Bitcoin. The media will call it bad names and the price will go down...   
  
**Conclusion:** Wait this one out a little longer to see how the Gox situation plays out.

This is bigger than I thought... It turns out that somebody is flooding coinbase with a bunch of small transactions that take longer than a day to comfirm... At the end of the day, coinbase automaticly gives the user's back their money into their account if the transaction never went through... That doesn't mean the first transaction won't comfirm though... It will, just at later time... An exploiter can receive the first transaction plus the coins coinbase gave back to the user.  
  
Example of small transaction:  
Into that double spend:  
[   
To my transaction:

This is the way I think about it... Money is your vote.. You vote every day on which products will survive and what products will die by what you spend your votes (money) on.... Every time the government raises taxes or creates inflation, they are stealing votes away from you and using it themselves. Rich people know how to manage their resources better than poor people, in return people give them more votes (again money)... In a free market, money flows to the people that know how to allocate resources/ provide the most to the population... A politician is simply a leaching middle man to the "votes" you've had all along.

Here's a recap of what they are proposing (TL;DR):
* Crowdfunding caps an amount an issuer can raise to $1 million in any 12-month period.  
  
* Crowdfunding caps the amount a person can invest in all crowdfundings over a 12-month period at 10% of annual income or net worth (incomes of $100,000 or more) or the greater of $2,000 or 5% of annual income or net worth (incomes of less than $100,000).  
  
* Crowdfunding must be done through a registered broker-dealer or registered “funding portal.” Broker-dealers and funding portals may not solicit investments, offer investment advice or compensate employees based on sales. Traditional investment banks have shown little interest in crowdfunding, leading to speculation that crowdfunding will be facilitated by lesser-known financial institutions with little or no retail investment track record.  
  
* Crowdfunding requires a disclosure document to be filed with the SEC at least 21 days prior to first sale, and requires scaled financial disclosure, including audited financial statements for raises of over $500,000.  
  
* Unlike Regulation D Rule 506 private placements to accredited investors following the JOBS Act, crowdfunding does not allow advertising except solely to direct investors to the appropriate broker/funding portal.  
  
* Annual reports must be filed with the SEC by a company which completes a crowdfunding round.

You could instantly fix this problem with a send timer or a return timer, in which BTC is returned from a transaction if a goal isn't met.

Coinbase has a cold storage policy... They only allocate a certain amount of bitcoins to be sent per day. They resupply that amount after every 24 hours. Usually the amount they allow per day is enough not to have any problems, but on big days that limit is reached and you have to wait until the next day.

After all the bitcoins are mined, then people will be mining for transaction fees.... It's a natural market because if you pay to low of a transaction fee, than it won't get accepted. The market will determine the price of these transaction fees.

Make a dwolla account and link your dwolla account to your bank account... dwolla transaction fees for any sum of money is only a quarter...

I wouldn't buy at the current price right now though... There is a lot of people in it for the "game" right now. I'm predicting by September it will be at a 30 floor average. It will probably stay at 30 until the infrastructure catches up with bitcoin.... After a storm like this, there is always the people that feel they missed out and will buy right away. Those people get burned on the second dip when people think the price was "back to normal".
@_date: 2013-04-18 08:05:52
I think the core of the issue here is what do venders charge in bitcoins if the price jumps around so much... Is this the point you were getting at?? There are many free market solutions to this problem that don't necessary need a "stable" currency, but rather a predictable currency value within an interval of time. A vendor doesn't need to take the instantaneous price of bitcoins and charge it to his customers, he can take a monthly average, a 6 month average, or a daily average. It's a decision made by the vendor.
@_date: 2013-04-14 20:00:51
It's in a bull trap right now... It will settle around 25-40 dollars in a few months. It will stay at that price until the infrastructure catches up with bitcoin.

You can tell by the outgoing transactions Coinbase takes, and that they send payments in time intervals rather than on point of payment... Next time try to send a payment from coinbase and see how long it takes to send... They save money by sending all the transactions at once, so your transaction will be delayed a little bit to do a lot at once.

If you look at the price of gold long term, gold has actually stayed relatively the same value...

The high we are seeing now, is all the people who are buying thinking that they missed out on the first boom. There are also a lot of people in the market right now for the "game". All of those 500 BTC sells and buys will go away when they cash out of the game. Remember, It has only been a few days now, but I agree it feels like forever. It is hard for people to sit around and spectate at these low prices so they will buy now. These are the people that get screwed in a few months when it levels out to 40-50 dollars. It may even go down to $20 dollars for a short period of time. My predictions are that by september we will see bitcoin's low. In the mean time, you can play the market and perhaps get some more money for when it hits those lows.

@_date: 2013-05-25 19:17:06
***Let me be the first to explain how an anti-tax based system will work.***  
   
In an anti-tax based system, projects and development will become competative because you are no longer guaranteed payment by state.(**EXAMPLE: An advil at a hospital is 10x more expensive than at the store. Why? because the advil company can hike the prices and still be guaranteed payment.**) To finance public projects it would work like kickstarter does. People would pledge a certain amount of money to have a project done, and if the pledge limit is reached then the project is financed. Want a new bridge? start a pledge.  
  
People vote with their money everyday on what they buy, choosing which businesses succeed and fail. An anti-tax based society would vote with their money rather than through a congressman's agenda.  
  
**IT'S THE WAY OF THE FUTURE!!**

FED policy... See their last FOMC meeting for specifics. They are mostly buying bonds with that money. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 05:10:46
There are actually some things in the development right now... Payments with return times just like a kickstarter.... I guess you wouldn't pledge so to say, but you would send a pledged amount to an address, and if the pledge wasn't met then you would get your BTC back. So it essentially works the same way.

I am a vendor and I'm currently using bitpay... The complaints I have with bitpay are that you can't have somebody pay you in dollars and then convert it to bitcoins. All bitpay allows is to convert from bitcoin to dollars. **Is it possible to get paid in dollars and have it pay you in bitcoins through your store? If not, this would be a huge plus that you might want to look into.**

It's funny how you didn't even read my later explanation of why... Gold looks like it is going through the roof in relationship to the dollar, but the dollar is actually losing value in relationship to gold. If you look at the price of gold in comparison to REAL commodities like food, gasoline, ect. The price has been quite relative. If you look at the price of gold in relationship to the dollar, it looks quite expensive. In reality, your dollars are cheap and the CPI is garbage.

Lets say I wanted to buy something through Bitpay... Bitpay has about a 15min window where you must send your transaction to them otherwise you have to jump through all sorts of hoops in order to get the payment to clear. All Coinbase needs to do is broadcast the transaction... Sometimes it will send right away, other times it will take several hours.... If I were to pay a restaurant for my food, I would have to wait several hours in order to leave, because the transaction isn't even broadcasted on the network let alone confirmations.

In order to delete a wallet from bitcoin-qt, you need to follow these steps:  
* Go to start and search in the search bar %appdata%  
* Press enter and you should be in "Roaming" folder  
* Scroll down and find your "Bitcoin" folder  
* In your "Bitcoin" folder you will see a "wallet.dat" file  
(**note: It is recommended that you don't delete your wallet.dat file, so back it up just in case** )  
* Remove your wallet.dat file from your bitcoin folder  
* Reload bitcoin-qt and your wallet will not show up. (or it will create a new one that is empty).

I have been wondering this as well... They make buying bitcoins instant, but the reality is, you can't receive BTC that quick in a trading environment... Especially when I'm watching GOX and don't see any big orders on point of payment.... To this, I have come to the conclusion that they are paying people bitcoins with other people's wallets... All the BTC is centralized to them, I bet they pay people in the BTC they have in their reserves and then buy BTC back at a different time or get it from people selling BTC through coinbase.  
Interesting strategy, but I just hope they don't overspread themselves and their is a run on the wallets, where everybody wants to pull their money out at the same time.

I honestly think we still need to work on a send timer... In the sense that a transaction is sent at a specific time, or BTC is returned at a certain time...   
  
This would be great for kickstarter projects with a "pledge"... If the pledge is not met, then you get your BTC back after a certain time period... If the transaction goal is met, then the BTC transaction is sent to pledge.   
  
This is also good for a trade mediation in case one person never pays and never trades, in our destruction transaction scenario. Also, transactions would be sent out at specific times.... This really wouldn't be that hard to code up.

OP posted the return transaction to the new wallet rather than the send transaction to the first location.... You won't see the 0.937 that he sent because he didn't post that transaction here. All we are seeing from the link he gave us is all the addresses in his wallet collectively sending to a change address.

For anybody reading this comment, I would like to point out that it won't floor at 40 cents to a dollar.... I agree with your premiss that it will drop but it won't drop past pre bubble prices... By my analysis, the floor will double the average from before the bubble. This puts bitcoin's average at around 30 dollars by September, then up from there.

It doesn't delete your wallet file. Go into %appdata% and find multibit. Your wallet should be in there. Also, you have to wait for your block chain to catch up to actually show a balance. Thats how it is with bitcoin-qt.

started with 19 sent 0.3  
showed up that 0.3 was sent and 19 went to a different address  
blockchain.info showed differently than clientside...  
waited and showed 30 something on my client side but not on blockchain.info  
tried to send the 30 btc to another wallet just to see if I had it...  
It hasn't comfirmed but needless to say, my client and blockchain.info are different.

Well for one, you don't have deal with the SEC with Bitcoin. Also, you don't even really need a company to do the crowdfunding, you can have software do it alone. This is great for startups to use Bitcoin as a way to fund their projects without all the government regulation.

Keep in mind, that the government doesn't have absolute authority... This currency isn't just central to the United States, therefore there is some political grey zone in shutting down a currency that isn't soley the U.S.... This is all assuming that the government could do anything anyway. Unless they know something more than all the prestige hackers that have tried to hack bitcoin before, they're out of luck. All the government can enforce, is regulations on merchants and venders.

As people use it more, and more people use it for savings and investment along with transactions... You can expect the price to become less volatile. Think of gold, is gold very volatile? It practically stayed at the same price for 30 years until yesterday.

Fiat implosion is closer than you think... Just look at what happened to the market when Ben Bernanke TALKED about tapering... Stock market took a dump, interest rates WENT THROUGH the ROOF... After seeing this, it is obvious that the economy is dependent upon the FED... Bernanke must of seen it too, because he is backpedaling now.  
I'm personally buying physical silver, but mining stocks are also a bargain right now. Also, something else to look at, physical is actually hard to come by right now, just check APMEX and you'll see that they are SOLD OUT on a lot of their inventory. APMEX spot price is so high right now, because they have to compensate for lack of inventory. Get ready for a bumpy ride. :D

I emediately tried to send the 30 BTC to another wallet even though there's no possible way I can have 30 BTC starting with 19..... It shows on the image I posted -30 BTC but I only started with 19.... That -30 was me trying to take 30 BTC out.... It hasn't comfirmed though.
@_date: 2013-04-24 09:08:29
OKAY :D ..... HERE ARE THE INSTRUCTIONS TO GET YOUR BTC BACK, THEY ARE STUCK IN YOUR CHANGE WALLET.  
**What we will do:**  
- In order to get your money back, you are going to get your private key off your blockchain.info wallet and move it to Bitcoin-qt. Your money isn't stolen, it is only stuck in your change address located in your wallet.  
**What you'll need:**  
- Caught up Bitcoin-qt client  
- Access to your blockchain.info wallet    
**Instructions**    
- Open up your blockchain.info wallet and click the Inport/export tab.    
- go down to "export unencrypted"    
- select the drop down thing that says "Select private key format" in the middle-top of the page.    
- From the dropdown thing select "Bitcoin-qt format"  
- copy the value following the "priv" **associated with the BTC address you indicated.** *(yes you can highlight and copy the private key, even though it doesn't look like you can)*    
**note:** *we are coping the private key readable by bitcoin-qt client. :D*    
- Now that you have your private key copied, open up bitcoin-qt client. *(make sure block chain is caught up)*    
**If your bitcoin-qt is not caught up, grab a glass of water and take a nap lol. Its going to take a while.**    
- Once your block chain is caught up, go to the "help" at the top of the bitcoin-qt client.    
- From the help click "Debug window"    
- Click the "Console tab" from the debug window.    
- Issue this command into the console input bar:    
"importprivkey *&lt;bitcoinprivkey&gt;*"  
replacing "*&lt;bitcoinprivkey&gt;*" with the bitcoin private key that we copied earlier from blockchain.info   
- hit enter and your private key **with the money** should be adding to your wallet there.  
  
:D  
**If there is any confusion let me know so I can update this post to help you and other people in the future that may have the same problem.**   
**EDIT:** Read here on explanation of what happened: [
