Seriously, these people are a fucking joke.

For a split second I wanted to see Bob Saget.

Nope, they were kebab priced kebabs. You can't think of btc/stocks like that.
@_date: 2015-04-26 20:00:35
Haha thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:31:05
Ah, I was looking at the market chart and it seems bitcoin has gone from a couple hundred to $800 in a couple months, will it ever go back down? Will there be a big crash or a series of small ones?
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:42:04
Damn, if only I had heard about bitcoin back then I should have invested.
But hindsight is 20/20 I guess ...
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:07:13
yes yes I know I have seen that quote many times in this subreddit
the problem is have the seed, water, and soil for the tree.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:32:26
Do not feel alone sir, I have yet to invest anything.
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:02:35
Thanks for keeping me optimistic &gt;&lt;
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:40:03
well let me explain to you the logistics of my life .. but that would be too boring, and is personal
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:00:20
When the value is overvalued
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:54:21
Okay, I plan on investing like $3k in this next year when I have some income I can play around with, so I will have plenty of time to think this all over.
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:43:48
As someone who learned about bitcoin 2 days ago, I'm planning on investing like $3k in February when I have some disposable income, I don't want to get caught up in all of this hype.
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:49:55
Lmao, solid advice.
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:53:44
I literally have $2 in my bank account that I can spend :(
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:51:13
Okay cool, thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:43:55
Okay I'm planning on investing $3k in mid February, is that too late to invest?
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:59:20
Duly noted
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:48:41
Damn well I won't have any extra money until then so I guess I'm screwed :/
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:33:58
Well so do you think it isn't worth it to invest this late in the game? Even if I do wait a couple months?
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:41:56
I have given this thought and am willing to risk it.
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:43:17
I am already verified on coinbase.com
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:58:48
Wow thanks! But how does this reddit tip thing work? How do I connect my reddit account to bitcoin?
edit: i signed up by messaging bitcointip but I am still confused on how to get it into my wallet..
edit: got the hang of it
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:56:51
:P I would not like the idea of having some unknown kid out there somewhere, I'll just hope for a crash before I'm able to buy and disregard your post even though I agree with it.
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:55:46
Why else? To see where this gets me. I could get 10 or maybe more BTC if this bubble pops, then see what happens the rest of next year.
