I'd never call anything in bitcoin a bull market until after the halving.

What is USD backed by?  If it goes to zero, what can I trade it in for?
@_date: 2019-07-18 07:26:33
Hey...thanks for the repo!  Do you know of any others?  Thanks.
@_date: 2019-07-10 18:21:16
Dollars to donuts he finally bought some and now wants to see it succeed.
@_date: 2019-07-18 15:47:29
Wouldn't other companies be working on it though?  I thought Lightning Labs wasn't a part of Blockstream so shouldn't they have a different repo? 
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:27:33
Good point.  Still at some point they'll need to move it I'd imagine.
@_date: 2019-07-06 16:34:46
That's only 126 million people a year that can secure their wealth on chain.   There will be other ways though.
@_date: 2019-07-20 00:02:30
That's just not true.  You have to have a deficit to receive and a surplus to send plus the channel expires.
@_date: 2019-07-19 07:12:03
Oh no...bigger blocks...the horror.  We're going to have to increase the block size eventually.  Right now you can only have around 126 million transactions a year(assuming 4 tx/s.  That's not going to onboard many.  
If it gets too bad, the people will reject it, new development teams will form and the people and miners will spin up a ton of nodes and force a damn block size increase.

When do you think AMP will be ready?
@_date: 2019-07-18 18:21:35
...or Grin.  They don't even have addresses.
@_date: 2019-07-06 02:34:31
How many can work worldwide instantly?  Yeah...tis going to happen.  Also, how many aren't created out of thin air with men at the top that can create as much as they like and give it to their friends without anyone knowing?  That's what fiat truly is.  Sure you can find spreadsheets the federal reserve lets us commoners see with generalized expenditures but that means nothing without verification.   If you can't know the inputs (new units created) your currency is a scam. 
...and that's not even the central bank.

Electrum is the best wallet for those of us that have been around a while and just want a wallet that is secure and works.
@_date: 2019-07-05 22:39:28
Was it weird that coinbase wanted a semen sample?
@_date: 2019-07-18 18:18:23
With Bitcoin we know the inputs(new units created).  How can we prevent laundering and new money creation in USD if they refuse to show us the inputs?
@_date: 2019-07-19 07:35:05
No it can't.  4 tx/sec x 60 x 60 x 24 x 365
@_date: 2019-07-03 00:11:31
I used to be a big blocker too.  This is just you being scared that small blocks and lightning will work.  It's a sad day when anyone in crypto does anything other than compete.  Compete!
@_date: 2019-07-19 07:40:06
Lol...nope.  Even during peak highs there are at most 2750 transactions in a block.  This is when the blocks are slam full.  
  
2750 x 6 x 24 x 365 = 144,540,000  
That's the raw, objective, time proven data if we're going to be precise.
@_date: 2019-07-18 18:20:13
This right here.  This.  This has NOTHING to do with the repubs or libs.  This is the Federal Reserve sending the current attack dogs out.
@_date: 2019-07-19 07:43:14
What are you smoking?  I just showed you the ACTUAL transactions per block for the past year even when blocks are slam full.
@_date: 2019-07-18 18:17:38
They say that like its a bad thing.
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:13:42
You still have to have an onchain transaction to create the channel with them unless you already have an onchain channel with someone else but that would STILL be an onchain transaction.  Also to receive you would have to have a deficit in your channel.
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:45:23
@_date: 2019-07-20 00:30:49
Well that was worth stopping a growing network in it's tracks.
@_date: 2019-07-03 04:32:34
A lot of people in are pushing the narrative that using Lightning makes you an exchange that must buy a money transmitter license or some such bs.
@_date: 2019-07-19 07:17:12
You'll keep hearing it until it happens.  Each successive time the quantity of people on the larger block size will increase.  


@_date: 2019-07-19 07:49:19
I don't believe it's specified any more at a limit but rather a weight.  The weighting doesn't equal 32MB in the old system though.    
Regardless, it's clear 2750 per block is the max.
@_date: 2019-07-19 14:02:56
You have to have an onchain transaction.  I don't see how that can happen if you can have at most 150 million onchain transactions each year.
@_date: 2019-07-17 01:45:38
I mean why not just travel back to when Satoshi first created it?  Seems kinda dumb for a time traveler.
@_date: 2019-07-03 00:09:47
This is the right way to grow bitcoin now.  If Lightning is going to be it, we have to start getting people to accept it.  Make this place like it used to be.
@_date: 2019-07-18 01:09:55
When amp?
@_date: 2019-07-19 04:23:21
@_date: 2019-07-19 07:28:39
Until it can do far more than 126 million transactions a year.
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:02:06
He likes the US Dollar but doesn't like currencies  based on thin air?  I'm confused.    That's literally what the Fed Notes are...I really can't say US dollars because there are no such things.  
Hell this is just commercial banks.  The private federal reserve banks can create as much money as they like, give it to whoever they like and no one knows.  That's a nice scam.  Hell who are they?   How much money are they creating for themselves?
