The Bitcoin mining network requires continues to draw criticism. Some claim that it will consume as much electricity as the country of Denmark by 2020.  In view that  enables Bitcoin to be used for financing renewable energy generation, how does this impact the Bitcoin ecosystems energy balance? No one knows for certain how much energy the Bitcoin network requires to run. In a recent Silicon Valley meetup, computer scientist Andreas Anonolpolis proposed that the Bitcoin mining network may require around 350MW of power to run, which is just over 3 TWh (terra watt hours) of electricity use each year. With an assumption that the majority of Bitcoin mining takes place in coal powered China, then the annual carbon emissions will be 3066000 metric tonnes. That’s double the carbon footprint of the world’s entire fleet of passenger-laden Boeing 747’s, if they were to fly continuously around the globe at once.
At a $1000 BTC price, one Bitcoin can be used to finance 1 kW of solar power plant. If that solar plant were to be installed in sunny but coal reliant and energy hungry Africa, 1kW of solar panels will generate 1800kWh of electricity per year, offsetting nearly 2 tonnes of carbon emissions.  In this case, the energy it took to mine that Bitcoin (666kWh) will be paid back in just under 18 weeks. Given that a solar panel will carry on generating clean electricity for at least 25 years, a single Bitcoin used to fund solar energy actually creates a positive balance of  400000kWh (400MWh) of clean sun-powered electricity over the system’s lifespan. The Bitcoin that financed it still exist, and are being traded in the markets doing work.
Bitcoin is money created on a silicon chip powered by electricity. It can now be used to finance silicon chips that produce electricity which can be sold for money – are we potentially witnessing the dawn of a 100% silicon based clean energy economy?

Or convert your BTC into income generating solar cells through The Sun Exchange. Just a suggestion. Take a look at

The wise man would use it to buy solar cells through The Sun Exchange ( and earn a predictable and non-volatile passive income stream from it, whilst powering Africa with solar energy.
