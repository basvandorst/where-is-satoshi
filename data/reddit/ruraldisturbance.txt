@_date: 2017-12-13 19:45:43
When taking all the Bitcoin is more lucrative than staying in business.  Is it really that far fetched guys?  This is a reoccurring thing with 3rd party's handling Bitcoin.   
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:10:48
This rule is exactly how this exchange behaves, i wasent shocked when I read it because if you have used Coinbase in the past 6 months they have used this rule on you already. 
How much more information do people need to see how scandalous Coinbase is!?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:57:16
They go down on EVERY big buy or sell event, people are learning they cant buy the big dips or sell the big tops with Coinbase/GDAX.  This is just one thing that makes them the worst, theres a lot more to add to the shit list.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:49:02
I am actively encouraging every one I know to move away as well.  I believe we are playing a dangerous game with Coinbase right now and its our job to stop.  
LocalBitcoins is where I headed and anytime anyone brings up Coinbase I simply tell them to stay away or eventually pay the price as I believe an exit scam is coming (Mt. Gox, Nicehash, ect)  Sometimes hoarding all the BTC is more lucrative than staying in business and expanding.

Just bought 5k worth on coinbase this morning, no problems.  If your scared, buy $10 then move the bitcoin to a paper wallet.  Become more confident then buy your whole one and do the same.
@_date: 2017-08-27 21:41:07
Not only will coinbase charge you a fee, but you'll pay a large percentage more than market price for your Bitcoin AND assuming your in the USA visa/mastercard will charge you a cross border fee after all is said and done.  Fun right!?

Bitcoin is exactly where he should put his money if he believes, and if he does choose to believe and goes long Bitcoin will mend his wounds and repay him all he has lost and then some.  
Will he choose to believe?  Its the difference between a fortune and nothing.  
@_date: 2017-08-10 00:04:49
I have to admit, the same has occurred to me and the big banks money is indirectly linked to bitcoin anyways, through the people. 
I cant imagine big banks not directly involved by this point, honestly.

@_date: 2017-08-15 06:13:32
Good point
@_date: 2017-08-19 06:42:12
Thats a tough thing to do for people living in the U.S. my friend, there are not many options for us to get in the game and it ain't pretty or easy once your in, spending limits, verifications,international blocks on credit and debit cards, ect. stop you from buying when you want to buy. 
I look at the coinbase/wire/cross border/miner fees as a necessary casualty of the game, if you go long you will make the fees back and then some so there's nothing to worry about ;)
@_date: 2017-08-15 06:21:16
Nice, I was watching at 1800,but I don't express any resentment for not buying because I was in a process and that process required me to not buy at 1800 but to speculate and learn about bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-08-16 04:51:22
I did almost the exact same thing as you with 12.5k, I read the white paper in 2013 and shrugged it off, started watching again in 2017 and then recently I just couldn't take it anymore, I had learned to much about bitcoin to deny the truth, I had to buy in big and hodl.
@_date: 2017-08-16 04:52:57
It doesn't bother me as much as the fucking fee's

You were forward thinking enough up until this point, now lets reasses the situation and be forward thinking again from this point on.
This is really simple, keep it a secret to not disrupt the family or work flow. Purchase your first home (Mortgage) on your combined earned income that your bringing in now.
Continue to hold, these next three years will set you up and when you do release the secret it will be over, time to cash out and take your place as a husband and father that cares enough to do the right thing for his family by giving Bitcoin the time it needs to grow which in turn should set you guys up for life.  
I am a husband and a father of 2, i am a long term holder but when the time is right for the better of this family, I will sell it all, and thay beach house in Maui aint as far away as I think it is. 
Bitcoin is here to enhance my chances of becoming independently wealthy, its not the only thing that will get me there. Theres a shell shock that happens to people over large sums of money, its better that it happen gradually, so everyonr can really work into it. 
You could even start selling a little, say enough for your down payment on a house, explain to your wife you have an investment, like a 401k, but I wouldnt give details, when she asks how much, tell her how much you put in, not how much its worth now. 
If you dont let this happen gently, and slowly, it could fuck everything up.

You asked a simple question and there's a simple answer.  
You have arrived at a forum of believer's.  Please don't be silly and compare BTC to the .com bust, tulips, or any stock market fallout.  You announce your skepticism and followed it up with regurgitated FUD, I often laugh at people like you. 
Bitcoin is new, it requires new thinking, new study and new education.  This takes a lot more effort than posting on reddit asking people why they're not skeptical.  
Its up to you to educate yourself on Bitcoin, the people of this forum have immersed themselves in it completely and you have a lot to learn from them and the rest of the community that supports majority network consensus and the original vision of Satoshi.
Now, back to 7k, and then to the moon!

Pretty simple story really even though nothing like this has ever happened to me before.  
I usually recommend Coinbase to newbs first, its an easy way to introduce people to the crypto trading system, after they are comfortable I push them toward lower fee exchanges.
Everyone in my life knows i'm the "Bitcoin Guy" well when the price fell to $3200 last week I received 2 calls with in an hour of each other. 
1st friend calls and tries to convince me Bitcoin is headed down the drain, I calmly refute his claims over and over until he snaps and says "I want a whole Bitcoin, make me whole".   I say sign up at Coinbase and confirm your bank acct and buy one, he says I already did but Im not going to be able to buy at this price by the time my account is confirmed, Im going to paypal you $3300 and I want you to purchase it for me then send it to me.   I say ok and do as he asks.  
2nd friend calls and and blurts out " im done watching this, I cant take it anymore, what do I need to do to buy Bitcoin?"  I tell him to go sign up at Coinbase and confirm his bank acct, he then has me walk him through it to come to the realization he will not be able to buy at the current price of around $3250.  He's like fuck!  I have to wait!?  What the fuck!   Im like, dude calm down,  this is why I told you to sign up with Coinbase a long time ago so when you wanted to buy you could just pull the trigger.  He's like what do I do?   I cant miss this.  
I tell him what my other buddy just did with Paypal and he goes ape shit, Im sending you 10,000 right now, Im like ok man, if thats what you want to do, I got you.  
3rd call was the next day, family member, super eager to get involved in Bitcoin, we had a long talk about mining altcoins, nicehash and pools.  He finally says to me, my wife cant find out about this, she thinks its a scam, how do I purchase Bitcoin.   I give him the rundown on Coinbase and hours later he melts down about the bank blocking Coinbase from his debit card and then finally I get the text his max limit was $500, so he bought $500 
I have came to the conclusion that I need to start a Bitcoin/Coinbase newb checklist for my friends and family so I dont have to waste all this time explaining the same shit over and over.  I can just send an email and tell them to complete the checklist and THEN I will help after they do that.  
This is the first time in my life I have ever had people entrust me with this kind of money, so its a good feeling knowing your friends and family trust you with their hard earned money but its also scary at the same time.  
What a fuckin week!

I hear what your saying and I understand, I also understand that believing anything big banks say come's with a level of trust that doesn't exist in me.  
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:52:26
My advice is this, yes, do it, but not yet.  
If you have to ask me why not right now its because you haven't done your BTC/USD due diligence my friend.  Visit tradingview everyday for 3 weeks and find people who are accurately predicting Bitcoin's price movements. 
Were currently closing out a cycle, there's a major buying opportunity coming in November, mark my words, use remindme! or whatever.  You need to have the money in an exchange waiting, it has to be loaded, ready to go.
When the price drops to its next cyclic low and you see what price you could have bought at and then the subsequent jump to $8000+ your regret will be larger than your bankroll, believe me and that statement is coming from a guy who trades large amounts and is loaded, waiting, with more than you, right now.
Talk is just talk, You also must gain knowledge and believe in Bitcoin, without belief its going to be very difficult for you.  You must 100% whole heartedly believe.  In order to do that you must be able to (within reason) predict Bitcoin's price movements and that will instill confidence and reenforce your new found belief.   You have to prove to yourself you can buy and sell at the right time using knowledge, belief and patience.
After all that, you gotta have the fuckin balls, do you got em?  You only have something to prove to yourself.

@_date: 2017-10-13 19:59:14
Yes 200k  thanks for the correction, I didn't run the numbers right then I was just trying to remember exactly how much it was.  
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:40:22
In my case this is true.  I came to value BTC over fiat BUT I still have to take profit for this to work because my native currency is fiat.  
So until JP Morgan starts accepting BTC as payment for my mortgage through them, I have to keep converting BTC to fiat to realize gains. 
I have to admit though, I would rather pay my mortgage in fiat because I value BTC so much higher than fiat when I pay for things with it I know I'm losing in the long run.  
When I pay for things in fiat I know that what I paid right now will probably the best value I can get for that money because in the future it will be worth less, not more like BTC.

The fact is active successful trades will out perform holding any day, in two years of trading I will have more BTC and more profit than you hodling at the end of that 2 years. 
Hodling is a great strategy for people who do not have the time, motivation or balls for trading.

@_date: 2017-09-14 18:14:09
That was not a unwise decision Newton and let me tell you why.   
When you bought in you obviously believed that BTC was going to 5k and above, correct?  You wouldn't have bought in at such a high price had you not believed in Bitcoin's potential to go above 5k.  
When I bought in I created a realistic sell target, I created the sell target from months of bitcoin research, the target was 35k.  I believe Bitcoin will reach my sell target (and beyond) so it doesn't really matter to me what position I take, in at $1500 or in at $4800 are both great positions to take when were going to 35k.
Forget my price speculation of 35k even if you believe that Bitcoin will go to 7k, thats 2k profit buddy, making $4800 a worth while investment.   I personally believe its a certainty that Bitcoin will go over 10k in the next 2 years.  
BTW, I had 35k by 2024 and over 50k by 2027.

No Problem.  
Setting a limit order before bed could have got you a great buy and speaking of limit orders I imagine that bounce at 2985 was a massive amount of limit orders being triggered at 3000.  
@_date: 2017-10-02 07:49:44
Im ready for that one
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:05:21
Why would you believe in it then?  Believe me, not many did, including myself.  
The main use for it was buying drugs on the internet and laundering money across borders. Chances are you were not an early adopter of Bitcoin unless you were into one of these things or computers/coding/cryptography.
I have met one early adopter in real life.  He bought $450 worth of BTC for $11 per coin.  
I said oh my god dude, do you still have it?   He says hell no, I bought an 8ball with it on the silk road.  That 8ball is worth like 200,000 now.

I know why the headline from the NY times was included in the genesis block and I believe the community is more than loosely aware that Bitcoin was a revolution, or as you put it a subversion from the current system.
You seem like a pretty smart person, I appreciate your reply and trying to educate me but I have to admit that my first comment was just being facetious.  Im actually a competent person (and trader) who in general see's anything the bank's say regarding crypto's as FUD so that's the way I treat it.  I spot it, I make fun of it and I move on. 
Obviously there could be time's where I do not regard what they say as FUD. That headline in the genesis block was put there by Satoshi out of what I believe to be the same distrust that I have for big banks, the FED and the fractional reserve banking model.
It's obvious big bank's have pissed off some of the brightest mind's and Satoshi was just one of them.  What happened in 08' was a fraud perpetrated by the highest level's of finance and government against the people of earth and it has not gone unnoticed.

Its hard to tell when, because the presentation is always long and drawn out.  I know for sure this bull run is running out of steam right now and you just need to watch it in the coming weeks. 
The bottom is always fast, so if your not on it, you'll miss it.   Even if you are watching it like a hawk you will not get a buy right at the bottom. 
All of my buys during a pull back either happen while its descending or ascending, catching the actual bottom is near impossible but you can learn to recognize the turn around and buy quick or skip looking for the turn around and just buy when you think its getting close. 
The last correction on September 14/15th for example, I didn't buy at bottom which was 2985, I bought at 3263 as I thought we could be reaching bottom soon and I was right.   
The bounce at 2985 was fast and impossible to catch, so I bought when I thought we were getting close to bottom.  In my opinion its easier to catch good buys while its descending rather than ascending.  
If your trying to catch it after its already bottomed you have to believe that the ascension is real and not just another leg in the downward movement. 
In other words, you need information supporting that the trend has changed when trying to buy the ascending price, thats tough to do in 30 minutes when the price has rocketed up 100s of dollar's.
