its called basic attention token, it's made by the guy who invented javascript and formed Mozilla/firefox. He got fired for being Catholic and decided to make a browser called Brave to fuck up Chrome and Firefox. Brave has a built in ad block, which uses can opt out of, to receive small payments in the form of BAT for looking at ads. The token has a built in mechanism so that advertisers know how long people engage with the ad. It's a system to improve on shitty internet ads that everyone ignores.
Realize that the richest companies in the world sell advertising online and the guy who invented Java Script and Mozilla is going to make a better ad delivery system for advertisers and he's tying it into a webrowser for people tired of facebook and google's privacy invasions.
Basic Attention Token. You can look it up.

I don't know what any of this shit is or what segwit is, but I doubled my money with Antshares because "Chinese ethereum" was good enough for me

would you use a browser with a built in ad blocker? Chrome and Firefox do everything they can to sabotage their extensions because they make money from those ads

A crypto I recommend you avoid until it dips, but I could be the guy saying and eth it's at 40. Look it up and decide for yourself. I sold when I doubled but it kept going up

bittrex is legit. I avoid other stuff. I lost about $100 of doge back when some crap exchange got hacked.
You can buy other coins and put them in a wallet and store them yourself if you dont trust the exchange

chinese ethereum. The dev lied about partnerships with Microsoft, alibaba, and the chinese government (certificate authorities) before clarifying his lies. It was rebranded as neo and entered the top 10 cryptos chart this weekend. I sold at 19 after buying in between 7-10 dollars and made off pretty well. Just put some money in BAT
