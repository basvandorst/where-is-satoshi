Post proof. As cool of a story this may be, a lot of parts are odd. The way you write, the references you make, etc. all don't add up to an 8th grader. Could you be one? Why yes and I'd be pleasantly surprised.

Read through it and it looks pretty cool. Would be really neat if you could take this class online.

I suppose indirectly, yes. I don't make spam sites to show up in search results. I use them to rank high-quality content for clients. But, I don't call them "spam" sites :p

Happy cake day man. Please, don't tip me. I mean it.

Couldn't agree more. The VC boys are in on this.

Why didn't you do this at 50? I literally called my dad at midnight and told him to invest $_________ only to sell when it hits 75. He's currently looking at a 30% return. I'm going to buy in more once it crashes and if you're going long, I'd recommend that you do the same instead of buying it at this short spike.

It depends what your end goal is, but a really powerful type of website to have in your network is a viral one. They are so easy to start and get to 50k+ followers via facebook. Rinse and repeat. After that, your network of 20 viral sites, 40 magazine/news sites, and 40 blogs will be pretty powerful for seo. Granted you aren't going to dominate payday loans, but you'll have a headstart for say... reddit tshirts :)

I've got 300+. Let's just say I market things ;)

FYI anything that resembles a link farm is useless now.

Woah. It's weird how the world connects. I read Fred Wilson's blog regularly and was quite glad that they funded Dwolla. I've also been quite interested in Bitcoin and now you have popped up on my favorite news/play site, Reddit. 
Always good to see how small the world really is. By the way, very well balanced article.

We should have a subforum where you have to have X amount of bitcoins to post. Even if it is only a few bitcoins, it would really help out.

your site is down
@_date: 2013-07-15 21:25:51
I will now start buying my domains with namecheap. Good job guys. I already need another 25 domain names so boom.

Nice site. Looks like a good service
@_date: 2013-07-16 17:26:41
No. Those were so 1997.

Sorry that I'm not a karma whore.
@_date: 2013-06-04 16:35:56
I see what you did there. Well done.
@_date: 2013-07-16 17:26:17
Sort of, yes. We spend a lot more time on each site in our network to make sure no site would ever raise any flags (even when viewed by a Google employee).
As far as service goes, we offer a service to high end clients that want to create an online "buffer" and those who need their closets cleaned.
