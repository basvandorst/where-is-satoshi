The number may be growing, but think of it on a percentage. 
1 customer out of a 100 they have has an issue
10 customer out of a 1000
100 customer out of a 10000
I personally have not had any issues, but as they get more and more customer the number of 1% grows. Not sure if that make sense anywhere but my head.

OP said he typed Bitcoin in a text field. Which that text field most likely filled in the rest of that survey. His responds is what cause Bitcoin coin up.
The point was that the user drove that survey. They would not going to spread other options.
Edit: Someone else replied
@_date: 2013-11-02 20:41:03
I use bitminter now, does either of these have an advantage over them?

I did that as a final project for a computer apps call. I think of the  30 in the class maybe one or two looked in to it afterwards. 
@_date: 2013-05-18 00:28:27
When people ask me about it, to give an overview, I tell them to think of it as a debt card. No physical money, just the number in your bank account. 
Your wallet is like a debit card, money can be sent to/from that account.
Mining is like the Fed(US) printing money. Bitcoin are "minted" through mining
Value is based on demand just like anything else the more people want it, the more it is worth.
Not sure if that help or if I explained it well, but it seems to do the trick when relating it to something people already know.
@_date: 2013-05-13 17:46:12
The site looks exactly mining united, that is one of the reason I asked.
I did not know of that subreddit
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:43:07
Is that upgrading from what they currently have or do you mean even to build from starch with those requirement.
@_date: 2013-07-24 21:49:04
Ugh...I was finally starting to make BTC from my holdings. This is horriable..I might ride it out. Not huge in and might be a buy if opp if he does not close it..
Or I might sell some to at least break even
@_date: 2013-07-11 21:44:08
I just verified for the instant. Still an hour to settle for spending, but million times better then a week. 
Does anyone know if the reoccurring will become instant as well?
@_date: 2013-05-13 01:22:47
That is the way it works, but there is a difference from a Ponzi scheme and stright up stealing them.
A ponzi scheme I can use low amounts and make a little.

I will have to check that out. See it if see how it works. TIL 
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:13:43
BTC-Jam or something like that exist already, however, I am not a fan, because of the lack of verification. 
I loan on sites like Prosper Marketplace and Lending Club which do a far better job of scanning applicants. The risk is still there but a much more transparency for the person risking the money. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:59:52
So if I went through the whole verification process and have never had issue with buying or selling, would I assume I am already on it or is it something separate?
@_date: 2013-06-05 21:02:31
I will have to look at that as soon as I get home.
@_date: 2013-09-12 21:12:56
I kinda like the thought, but it has it pros and cons
It would be great if every car was self driving. If I  have an emergency and need to get by, or I just want to get home as fast as possible.
However, it would take no time before people figure out how to make there car go 10 mph below the speed limit just to collect tips.
Without self driving system, the honor system is would be needed one to send the money and the other to  move out of the way
@_date: 2013-05-17 01:42:14
It sucks, I netted a loss of .3, not major but still sucks. I was cycling small amount. Assumed it was a scam, but figure it would last a little longer.

I work and make okay money, just got off about an hour ago and checked the mail. It was my rant and  I just need to let the frustration out. I sold and am good, just those unexpected thinks just drive me nuts.

We use survey like this at work. The OP could have posted cow shit on the previous page and the survey would compared cow shit to paypal (much funnier)
So it is paypal looking for different competitors rather then specifically BRC

Well I am still a week to week person when it come to my paycheck. While I believe in bitcoins it is still to much of a gamble for me to go all in.

I normally use williamsbrewing when I order online, but midwest is one of the largest, if they do it I think the rest would follow. 
Now I really want to do some brewing.

Which takes 30 days to get verified, until then it is 10BTC.
Just adding for the OPs knowledge
@_date: 2013-06-22 15:01:03
I may  be interested.  What do you expect the ROI to be?

Your interview questions, what type did of question did they ask was it highly technical?  
Edit: Saw the answer
@_date: 2013-09-04 21:58:59
The price drop is starting to pull me in. I have been invest on BTC with mining contract, with the stock price sinking so bad, no matter the return I end up losing BTC. (I have lost 6 BTC over the last 2 month trying to maintain .1 dividend)
So I have started buying block erupters, 35 dollars (fiat) or so. I decide I might as well. I am  losing that sinking more BTC into falling stock..
Based on the hardware price it is work a shift in how I accommodate my BTC 
@_date: 2013-09-24 01:51:42
I think I am staying away for a while, 8 BTC (not much to some), so I think I will be a little gun shy.
@_date: 2013-07-25 20:31:06
If I had the coin I would. Using my dividend to buy more and more dividend paying stocks. 
On day I will have enough for a few shares.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:51:24
Ahh gotcha, I think all of those things would a good idea. As a exchange I could defiantly see how hard/costly it would be
@_date: 2013-08-23 15:56:57
it lets me log in and then nothing, I am using the Google authenticator
@_date: 2013-07-25 16:02:12
   I think this is what you are looking for. None of them come with voting rights, so all the info is tied to your account. 
I personally look at dividend and the what % paid over the 30, 90, or longer period.
However, if you are US investor, there is a chance this site will be closed for to you soon.  These is a thread from yesterday on here. 
@_date: 2013-05-21 01:33:01
no doubt, I don't know why they even bothered to put that BS up
@_date: 2013-05-13 01:02:57
Seem to be the exact same set up as miningunited. Anyone tried this one out yet?
Wondering, they don't have the traffic yet that miningunited has, might be worth a shot?
@_date: 2013-07-28 16:20:44
Let me clarify for everyone reading this. I seem to have issues on my end.   So it probably something I did.
@_date: 2013-07-12 02:34:21
I would doubt they would directly, the have to notify you if it is a credit tool. I sure they can make collection attempt debit your normal bank a few times which will cost a small fortune if the funds are there. 
I would say the collection side would be the same as not paying a cell phone or hospital bill 
@_date: 2013-06-21 21:37:10
I did not know about that feature. I just set up a reoccurring (.1) a pay check (High roller.
Does it speed the process up any? 
@_date: 2013-09-13 20:18:06
I don't have a problem it is going to a good cause. What I think is saying is that that using the homeless as billboard could be seen as Crass. 
But I could be wrong
@_date: 2013-05-30 18:29:59
You are correct, if they follow normal business rule. You can write off you expense but you need to pay taxes on any profit. 
The thing is when do you realize those profits. 
 
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:06:40
Yeah, I have used them for loan in the past, if your credit is good they normally beat banks, especially in the unsecured loans.
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:59:25
Yeah, but I was hoping to hold longer. I excited about the long term. Time to restart.
@_date: 2013-11-01 23:27:25
I was going to use one of my CC, but I relized most of them do not do show pending transaction. The show the amount of available reduce.
I have to call my CC company and ask them for the transaction amount such a pain in the ass. 
@_date: 2013-05-30 18:40:35
The dream, I can even get to one BTC
@_date: 2013-06-21 21:31:58
I have never bought on gox, but coinbase charges .15 bank fee then 1%. Not bad
Wish there was a way put cash there to buy on demand though

Thanks for all the info,
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:13:25
I lost a crap load in in one of the exchange close. I had .1 daily dividend. which I had been reinvesting, so it was all going into stock.  Then when the closure was announce it went from 13 btc to about 5 
@_date: 2013-08-23 16:13:51
Okay, I just could not notify anyone because of the error. I figure some one on here would know how to let someone know.
When you get yours fixed can you let me know, so I can check mine?

or I think you can try again in 24 hours
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:33:38
On this topic, I had a question for the community. Would it be wise to put out material on how to get a purchase bitcoin, maybe a way to enroll at the store. 
Alot of people are willing to sign up for credit cards if given a discount would that  transfer?
@_date: 2013-08-22 20:17:09
Where can I get one? It need a better box. I would imagine it would be much like the coinstar  in supermarkets.

Not really sure here are the details, it provides. 
The referral program is only enabled on some accounts.  You can see if your account is eligible from the referrals page.
For eligible account, you can earn 0.01 BTC for every user you refer to Coinbase who buys or sells at least 1 BTC!
Users you refer will need to sign up after clicking one of your referral links and start a buy or sell of at least 1 BTC.
Why did my referral bonus not show up?
There are a few possible reasons: 
•The referred user must have signed up after clicking your referral link (and if they clicked multiple referral links they must have clicked your link last).
•Referral bonuses are only paid if the user you referred verifies their account and completes a buy or sell of at least 1 BTC.  The payout will typically arrives about 10 minutes after this.
•It can take some time for payments to go out, and they may not arrive immediately.
•We make an effort to watch for duplicate or fake accounts and don't pay out referral bonuses on these accounts.
Unfortunately we can't guarantee payout on every account you refer due to the limitations mentioned above and risk of fraud, but we make a good faith effort to do so whenever possible. 
@_date: 2013-05-28 16:05:44
Update, thanks
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:54:33
I find telling them to think of 1 btc as a dollar and then there are quavers, nickels, dimes, etc. Most of the time it help.
It is not exactly the same, but relating it to something they know helps.  
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:25:41
If I just use my Fiat to buy btc  to replace whatever I bought with BTC. I lose a little in fee (depending if I get a discount for paying in BTC), but it spending help us all

Waiting to know myself
@_date: 2013-07-25 16:51:17
I was up to .03 in dividend a week  and was reinvesting in other stocks or bonds.  I know it is not a lot but going from .001 to .01 did not take long and going to .01 to .03 took a lot less. I was aiming for .1 a week by the end of summer.  
(I have also been buying coins not just dividend)
Growing a steady supply was the  long term goal, so in the short term it was not a big deal, but with the growth starting to pick up it could have been down the line.
Any knowledge on bitfunder or are they in the same situation?
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:02:17
If only I could tell a good story, it might have been more impressive
@_date: 2013-07-11 21:51:02
That is what I am working on doing myself, paying  dividend paying stock. 
Then set a sell price on the stock for a slight profit after fees.
One day I will manage to get that full share.
@_date: 2013-05-28 19:48:35
I am late to the easy coins. It take weeks to manage .001 these days. Other then purchasing them, which is risky with all the potential seizures of account. 
Out free BTC is one thing out BTC purchased with money is something else.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:45:30
As a customer you would not pay directly. The exchange would pay it I would imaging it would be much like the FDIC works in US, each depositor is insured up to x amount.

Well right now getting the enough to buy shares is a goal. I pulled about half of my holding out to capture my gains. Left it in BTC. As soon as I get enough to buy in I will. Still a ways off though
