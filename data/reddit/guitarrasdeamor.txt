What happens for these fast transactions, is is it different than me sending to somebody else in the fact they always get it instantly and doesn't have to be confirmed? Just curious how a retailer handles that.

Can confirm, sent off a transaction yesterday morning with Electrum, was unconfirmed so used this at around 5pm and had the money within next block or whatever. It did however show on Blockchain my money as 'spent' rather than 'confirmed' transaction..don't know if that is because it is a different mining pool it pools it into or not (I can't think of any other buzzwords so hopefully that makes sense).

Not many movies to watch, need more BTC to buy some

I bought $300 right before it went down, glad I did it early.

Believers like me buy and price drops $30 an hour later. Luckily it wasn't too much.

Yes Google is definitely the one at fault here.

They basically authenticate everything for you; sites like Mint do it to consolidate your info as well. I was able to just add numbers to my account. Select 'other'.

If you're dealing with large amounts of bitcoin in an offline wallet, you should probably know not to click the ad on top of Google.

What if you just buy some here and there for casual investments? Like during this down period just because.

Are you hiring DevOps or operations people to make sure your website stops going down so often? :)

Coinbase will after you go through the signup but there is limits.

I'm using 'Bitcoin Ticker Widget' on Android.
@_date: 2017-01-12 01:03:47
Yep...and you can get caught easily buying higher than you think when price drops quickly on other tickers.

Sounds like typical user stupidity tbh.
