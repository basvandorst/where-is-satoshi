Umm.. mostly a garbage post.
1 and 2 are crypto 101. Keep that explaination for your lambo get rich quick crowd.
3 is idiotic. The point of Bitcoin is that is YOUR money (not a centralized bank or government). Someday you won't convert to fiat, you'll use Bitcoin to pay for goods/services.
4 made very little sense. Yes, governments can and will fight crypto, but they can't stop a decentralized cypto phenomenon. It's impossible to fully censor a global protocol. $0 Bitcoin will never happen, that's a rediculous comment (barring a security flaw/catastrophic event), I'll buy them all at $.00001
Go to YouTube and watch some Andreas videos :)
