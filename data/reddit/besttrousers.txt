Then demonstrate it.
Look at [GDP per capita]( do you think a change in trend growth around 1964 (Xerox introduces the fax machine) or 1990 (Tim Berners Lee writes the WorldWideWeb?).
@_date: 2018-05-14 15:22:15


What empirical evidence? You keep making assertions, but do not back them up.
@_date: 2018-05-14 16:18:16


And? The fax machine *also* led to business happening over fax. Xerox was one of the largest and most profitable companies in the 1970s.
Look at what other people were claiming in the 1990s: 
Read Robert Gordon on how the changes due to the internet have been *smaller* than past technological changes:


and achieved growth rates exceeding that of the "golden age" of 1913-72. Accordingly
many observers have declared the "New Economy" (the Internet and the accompanying
acceleration of technical change in computers and telecommunications) to be an Industrial
Revolution equal in importance, or even more important, than the Second Industrial
Revolution of 1860-1900 which gave us electricity, motor and air transport, motion
pictures, radio, indoor plumbing, and made the golden age of productivity growth possible.


Inventions of the past. It dissects the recent productivity revival and separates the revival
of 1.35 percentage points (comparing 1995-99 with 1972-95) into 0.54 of an unsustainable
cyclical effect and 0.81 points of acceleration in trend growth. 


acceleration is attributed to faster multi-factor productivity (MFP) growth in the durable
manufacturing sector, consisting of computers, peripherals, telecommunications, and other
types of durables. There is no revival of productivity growth in the 88 percent of the private
economy lying outside of durables; in fact when the contribution of massive investment in
computers in the nondurable economy is subtracted, MFP growth outside of durables has
actually decelerated.


shows how their development and diffusion in the first half of the 20th century created a
fundamental transformation in the American standard of living from the "bad old days" of
the late 19th century. In comparison, computers and the Internet fall short. The rapid
decline in the cost of computer power means that the marginal utility of computer
characteristics like speed and memory has fallen rapidly as well, implying that the greatest
contributions of computers lie in the past, not in the future.


invention of the Internet has not boosted the growth in the demand for computers; all of
that growth can be interpreted simply as the same unit-elastic response to the decline in
computer prices as was prevalent prior to 1995. Second, the Internet provides information
and entertainment more cheaply and conveniently than before, but much of its use
involves substitution of existing activities from one medium to another. Third, much
internet investment involves defense of market share by existing companies like Borders
Books faced with the rise of Amazon; social returns are less than private returns. Fourth,
much Internet activity duplicates existing activity like mail order catalogues, but the latter
have not faded away; the usage of paper is rising, not falling. 


activity, like daytime e-trading, involves an increase in the fraction of work time involving
consumption on the job.

Less than the previous hundred years.
@_date: 2018-05-14 13:47:30


What evidence?
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:23:54






This isn't empirical evidence. This is some dude's opinion.
@_date: 2018-05-14 15:07:57
Best example of this that I know of is Tetlock's work. Experts do better than non-experts (though cognitively flexible experts do the best). I'm not aware of any specific studies looking at economists vs. non-economists.
I'll note that, contrary to your assertions, at least one study has shown that Krugman has the best prediction record acorss a wide variety of pundits: 
@_date: 2018-05-14 15:32:51


I've seen it earlier, so it's somewhere on the internet.


He was *correct* about this. Krugman made this point before the dot-com bubble collapsed. The internet *hasn't* had a major effect on the economy (ie, we're not seeing faster economic growth) contrary to what others were predicting in the 1990s.
People who were skeptical about the internet's ability to remake the economy in 1998 were correct - the NASDAQ took 20 years to recover!


I believe you are misreading him here as well - see his comments: 


That's pretty much the situation we've ended up in.


I'm not familiar with this.
@_date: 2018-05-14 13:46:32


That's not how currency works. When lots of people use the same currency, it becomes less able to respond to economic shocks (the best example of this is the EU, where Germany and Italy need very different monetary policies).

Again, this isn't empirical evidence.


I disagree with the premise. Economists do a bad job of forecasting, but do substantially better than everyone else.
@_date: 2014-10-08 18:06:56


Except, y'know, dollars.
@_date: 2014-10-08 18:17:12
That is inaccurate. Krugman served on a policy advisory panel (with several other professors and journalists). See [here](

This comment is *adorable*.

Can anyone in this thread tell me:  
1.) Why economists think the gold standard is a bad cureency system.
2.) Why - specifically - these issues will not occur with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-09 16:44:00


Do you know if anyone who actual works on these issues in developing countries feels the same way?
What are the advantages of bitcoin vs M-PESA?

Actually, there really isn't such thing as a "Keynesian" or "Chicago" school - and hasn't been for around 30 years.

Because technologically savvy people have severe misconceptions about economics?
@_date: 2018-03-16 18:38:26
I linked a Krugman paper. Many economists (just not the RBC folks) were well aware of these issues.

It's not "bad for the state". The Great Depression was bad for everyone, not "the state."

Yes. That would work. Familiarize yourself with nominal rigidities.

GDP growth post-internet has been about the same (slightly slower, actually) that GDP growth pre-internet. 
Look, I love the internet. Reddit, for example, is awesome. But it's a blip in GDP.
@_date: 2013-12-29 05:38:02


That seems fairly implausible, doesn't it?


This would have increased GDP.
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:20:08


Except that's not true - one can check that easily using the NBER [business cycle dates]( 
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:35:46
It's had little to no impact in the disaggregated GDP numbers.
@_date: 2013-12-28 22:55:13


This was true. Remember that in 1998, people were seriously claiming that the internet meant the end of the business cycle. That didn't happen.
@_date: 2013-12-29 10:40:24
That's what he meant. Remember, he is making this claim at the height of the NASDAQ bubble . Lots of people were saying the jnternet's impact was going to be transformative.
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:23:25
What about bitcoin makes it such that the quantity theory of money does not apply? is MV no longer equal to PY? Is the aggregate supply curve no longer vertical in the short run? If so, why not?

There is tons and tons of literature on this. It goes under the heading of "macroeconomics". I'd suggest:
* Milton Friedman: "Monetary History of the United States"
* Barry Eichengreen: "Golden Fetters"
* Ben Bernanke: "Essays on the Great Depression"
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:22:58
Read the above Marginal Revolution post:


@_date: 2013-12-29 01:55:55
Milton Friedman, author of "Monetary History of the United States" would agree with Krugman that a deflationary currency is unwise. Krugman's analysis is largely resting on Friedman's.
@_date: 2013-12-28 23:06:48
None of this addresses his argument. Bitcoin has a lot of properties that we understand quite well, and is very similar, from a currency POV to gold. 


But why? Is there any *reason* to say that everything about bitcoin is going to be different? Why wouldn't the conventional laws of economics apply?
@_date: 2013-12-29 05:46:45


Monetarist, but close enough :-)


Here's the problem - a currency that grows in value is really bad at coping at productivity shocks. I think [LRAS/SRAS]( is the most useful for thinking through this. If something bad hit the economy prices fall, and so does output because - in the short run - you want to be able to cushion the blow by expanding the monetary base. Again - this is just Milton Friedman. Bitcoin doesn't let you do that.
@_date: 2013-12-29 04:22:18
And so can everyone else, which means they will accept dollars as a currency.
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:24:45
What about the block chain makes his argument incorrect?
@_date: 2013-12-29 20:35:22


As do I. Just be cognizant that "eventually" can be a long time. Japan has been in a deflationary slump for decades, with horrible effects.


That'd be awesome. A crypto currency that, for example, targeted nominal GDP and was kept away from human hands would be ideal.
@_date: 2013-12-28 22:57:16


What about the protocol refutes his argument?
@_date: 2013-12-29 01:26:57
I'm not referring to the number of cycles; I'm referring to he lengths of cycles. Since the Fed contractions have been shorter, expansions have been longer.

Not true, he win the John bates Clark prize which is more prestigious, if less well known to lay audiences, than the Nobel.
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:07:24
It's a good read! It's written in 1963, so it doesn't criticize bitcoin directly, obviously. But it shows how the Great Depression was cause but the inability (or unwillingness) to expand the money supply.
