It is so obvious that Governments are now running scared about crypto, Bitcoin in particular. 
Watch the negative articles roll out now about Bitcoin. Remember the Sinclair Group "Democracy" video - they will do a similar one about Bitcoin.

Looks like the autists from are finding out about Bitcoin.....

Thank you for this link. Very interesting.

Sorry, change it to 911

Would have to be conseses amongst everyone, like conseses about making Lightning Network. Like an update to Bitcoin Core. It has been mentioned several times, making the tps from 7 to 14 or seomthing. I honestly don't know why it hasn't been done.
@_date: 2019-03-10 19:21:16
Wasn't this posted like a week ago from the OP, not a repost from Facebook?
@_date: 2019-03-29 19:23:00
Hold for 10 years. You'll be fine
@_date: 2019-03-12 21:07:27
Thank you

It's an option contract which gets its value on the price of the underlying entity (in this case, BTC). Doesn't matter if you do calls/puts.
@_date: 2019-11-18 04:39:03
I think there is a global trend forming. Have a look at the amount of debt the US has, it's in the trillions (~$20+ Trillion) - it will never be paid back.


Bloomberg - 
Negative interest rates starting to pop up around the world:
- Denmark
- Sweden
- Japan
- Switzerland
- Bulgaria (0%)
- Eurozone (0%)
And now Lebanon is in trouble.

Gold bars fraudulently stamped with the logos of major refineries are being inserted into the global market to launder smuggled or illegal gold, refining and banking executives tell Reuters. The fakes are hard to detect, making them an ideal fund-runner for narcotics dealers or warlords.

How many panels did you get?
What brand inverter do you use?
@_date: 2019-03-12 21:02:58
Wow, thats a lot of panels. Well done. Can you put up some more pictures of the rest of the set up please? The Tesla powerwall is pretty expensive (in Au at least) for a bettery backup, but if you make enough money l'd say go for it. Not sure if the built in inverter of the Powerwall can handle that much either....
@_date: 2019-11-18 04:29:59
I don't think the price will move much until 2021, at least 6 months after the halving
@_date: 2019-11-03 19:16:50
Trezor 
@_date: 2019-11-15 04:02:13
How much is it?
What does it do?
Where can someone purchase one?
I mean, a little bit more information would be good....

@_date: 2019-03-19 09:29:26
it's a 5 year old quote. People change their minds all the times. Having said that, does Coinbase support Segwit?
@_date: 2019-11-02 16:42:04
Saw this


@_date: 2019-11-15 11:38:57
Do these have any security features? PIN or password?
@_date: 2019-11-18 17:06:33
Did you just see this post on r/Bitcoin ?
@_date: 2019-10-07 10:31:26
Quick glance and you have a ~$300 premium over Coinspot. Fuck that.
Coinspot buy price is $11,925.05
Hardblock buy price is $12096.45

Thank you for posting this. Great interview
@_date: 2019-06-25 19:17:57
This is huge news.
Imagine a few big hedge funds deciding to settle in BTC instead of cash - the price will definitely spike.
@_date: 2019-10-07 18:56:12
Yes, even with fees Coinspot is cheaper. I don't use BPAY, I use Poli, free and instant.
I just tried to do another comparison and got this...
Thats no good....
@_date: 2019-06-25 19:13:06
This is great

Thank you
@_date: 2019-02-05 19:01:06
I hear you, but, if there is a rush for the gate and people start selling, holders might sell and rebuy in at a lower price, eg; why have 10 BTC when you could have 20?
@_date: 2019-02-22 00:10:10
Why don't they increase the number of transactions per second? It can be done...
@_date: 2019-06-28 09:17:26
@_date: 2019-06-16 18:57:52
Yes. I also posted this.
unpopular opinion - I hate the vegeta memes

@_date: 2019-12-16 10:46:42
ok. Has this happened?
@_date: 2019-12-16 06:20:42


How do we know if a nation state like North Korea hasn't found a bug and exploited it? Thats my biggest worry
@_date: 2019-04-27 18:52:43
Everyone on r/Bitcoin was very, very positive about Samourai wallet and to use it to store Bitcoin recently. Goes to show....don't believe anything on Reddit
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:36:07
BTC over 100k type of spike
@_date: 2019-12-03 17:56:17








@_date: 2019-12-30 18:06:44
I would say the stupid cartoons would be better banned than BTC ATMs
@_date: 2019-04-07 18:47:40
What about Bisq or StellarX ??
@_date: 2019-04-09 09:25:30


Your putting words in my mouth. I never said that.






@_date: 2019-04-09 18:45:33
So when there is a major bug discovered in the Bitcoin Core protocol (as has happened in the past several times), how do they go about patching it and getting it out ????
@_date: 2019-04-09 09:19:22






@_date: 2019-04-30 11:13:34
I saw this on the r/Bitcoin sub the last few days.....
@_date: 2019-04-27 18:56:23
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:42:46
Increase the number of transactions per second, from 10 to 20 for a start.
I know that when some cryptocurrencies upgrade their code (like PIVX for example), miners have to use the latest software, but BTC doesn't do this and it's comparable to Android where you have multiple versions of software running together .
@_date: 2019-04-15 07:54:07
Satoshi mined 980,000 - which are presumed lost forever.
So, we are down to 20 million pretty much right off the bat.
@_date: 2019-04-08 19:12:35
Like iOS?
@_date: 2019-01-07 09:26:44
Well done
@_date: 2019-01-11 23:35:39
What about this?
I think that the block halving will also play a pivotal role
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:52:29
Almost all of the coins in Yobit are 'under maintenance' = scam. It's a joke. Do not use.
@_date: 2019-01-05 05:59:04
Are Mt Gox customers getting BTC that they lost back?
@_date: 2019-01-14 03:20:50
Yeah, would be great if someone could upgrade this chart. l'm not technical enough
@_date: 2019-01-07 10:58:06
I have zero way of solving this. I hope that the person who does, it does goes to the right person.
Question - wasn't there a similar riddle last year too? Did that get solved?
@_date: 2019-01-05 06:38:45
I only ask because of some articles last year regarding repaying customers...
@_date: 2019-09-28 00:40:24
Do you ship globally or just USA?
@_date: 2019-05-02 18:45:37
Yeah, l've said this numerous times - the tps should really be increased in the BTC Protocol, and have been downvoted/shot down every time l suggest it.
@_date: 2019-05-19 08:21:06
Yep. And have a look earlier today and people in another Bitcoin thread are praising Samourai wallet
@_date: 2019-05-06 04:55:03
Lets be honest, Bitcoin is like Android - fragmented versions all over the place. Not everyone uses Segwit or batch transactions (look at Binance for example).
@_date: 2019-05-08 11:12:37
Interesting that last time Binance had a major hack, that was thwarted, it was all related to API's with a pump'n'dump of some coin (can't remember).
Maybe more compartmentalisation of API's needs to happen.
Also, physical hardware keys to log in would be good (like Yubikey), and to also manage account information too.
@_date: 2019-05-02 19:00:42
For holding BTC or alt coins too?
Trezor T
Ledger Nano X (releasing shortly)
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:44:30
Bisq or Stellar X (DEX) would have been better.
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:47:30
You can pick up a Ledger Nano S or Trezor One for under $80 - that is not expensive IMO.
@_date: 2019-05-20 10:13:09
I wouldn't say 'exactly' - it's an estimate
@_date: 2019-05-05 19:09:55
Just had a quick look through your online gallery. Brilliant.
@_date: 2019-05-20 18:57:31
Get over yourself mate
@_date: 2019-05-18 11:36:15
Satoshi has 900,000 that he mined, considered gone forever.
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:00:19
If you use an exchange, you don't have a choice - like Binance
