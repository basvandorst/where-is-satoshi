According to the fed one of the biggest reasons the US and many other countries are against crypto are not because of their “lack of value” or whatever.  One of the biggest pros that comes with crypto adoption is transactional anonymity but that’s also the reason many major governments are not comfortable with it. Reasonably someone could be running underground drug rings or funding terrorist operations.  Due to crypto’s security, no gov. would be able to track where it’s citizens’ money goes.

If by traceable you mean you can trace public key's I'd have to say you're absolutely correct.  Unfortunately, for all intents and purposes that means very little to any government as it would be very hard to directly associate a wallet's public ID with a person's legitimate identity.  [Here's the president of the Boston Federal Reserve responding to a question about crypto.](  My earlier comment was practically paraphrasing what he said(as I am fairly certain this is the most recent Government address of cryptocurrency adoption).  
It is fairly well known that laundering is incredibly easy to do using crypto and the only way to solve that would be by having personal information attached to our wallets that governments would have access to, something that I feel would dilute some of the appeals.  
I am not against crypto, but the bandwagon on this sub is pretty intense, it's fairly easy to understand why major governments are amped to adopt right away. 
Also if you're at all interested in the U.S.'s current economic standing I'd definitely recommend that video I attached Rosengren pretty much breaks it all down.
