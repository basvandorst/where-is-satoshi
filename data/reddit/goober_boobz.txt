Or, Bitcoin transfers are super slow getting transactions verified. Bitcoin is widely known by experienced crypto traders to be a store of value and not a coin for transfer, although that was the original idea. I would suggest buying LTC or ETH as transaction times are far less. It can take days or even weeks to confirm a block transaction that size on the Bitcoin blockchain. LTC and ETH are on the Coinbase exchange and have an improved version of the blockchain thats just more efficient at approving transactions on the blockchain ledger. The money isn't lost, the laggy blockchain is just that--laggy. It could show up in a week or two if you just wait.
Just FYI: contacting authorities brings bad light to the crypto space. My advice is do your own research before you buy, especially that amount. Every Coinbase account has a limit for withdrawls/deposits depending on how secure your account is. Chances are OP doesn't have 2 factor auth activated on his account too. Coinbase obviously takes security seriously, as they want to be a legitimate place for new and novice crypto users, hence why they cooperate with IRS audits. In fact, OP has made his account less secure by overreacting to a security issue, by posting his case number.

This is so true. "Bitcoin make me money? Buy Bitcoin? Much wow!" They should have a rule that noobs only buy Doge.

Coinbase is literally the gateway drug for crypto.

What about a cold wallet or paper wallet?

I bought $200 worth of bitcoin yesterday. I bought it at $4800. It's now at $5200+. I'm a shy investor but even I can't deny the momentum is crazy. Jump in before you get left to far back.
