I don't understand. Coinbase has a bitcoin wallet but that's not the same as a hardware wallet. A hardware wallet is what you the user are responsible for. Are you saying that if people should use coinbase to store their bitcoin? That seems against the popular opinion that everyone should keep their bitcoin in a hardware wallet. 
On a side note, coinbase, at this point, is nowhere as nearly regulated and safe as a financial institution like a big bank. That would take atleast a few decades.
And yeah I did not say banks exist primarily for storing your valuable assets but that is one of their main functions. But everyone I know and their moms and dads keep large savings in a savings account/retirement account that is managed by a bank. The other purposes a bank serves such as providing loans/credit is not addressed by crypto currency, as it is just a currency not a financial system.

Yeah that's the major advantage. Like the banks can be used to safeguard it but the actual movement of btc and validation of transfers is handled by the network and not the banks themselves.

Your second paragraph is the point I tried to make by making this post.
But i still don't understand the need for the bank to establish a payment network. If they do that you're just giving banks more power and more responsibility, and that system could lead to banks of higher authority, and then eventually a central bank (i.e. a central bank in your layer 2). Why would you need/want this? In other words, why do this as an addition to handling custody? To me security and less fees seem to be separate issues.

As with eveything bitcoin, very ambitious but yeah I hope you're right.

All the banks would be keeping is information for access to an account, not the actual assets in the account (which is managed by the network). So in our case the bank would be serving as our hardware wallet. When there is a transaction, the bank doesn't need to keep track of anything (the hardware wallet doesn't keep track of anything). The network handles the transaction. The exchange of bitcoin occurs over the network (bank would not manage delivery or receipt so i don't get why "banking" at the same institution means anything), and the bitcoin amount associated with the hardware wallet updates by itself. I don't see why the bank needs to keep track of anything when the network itself is managing that.

I guess. I feel the ultimate goal is to achieve this but the point of that was to highlight the magnitude of people that would be affected. Even if its much less, it is a flaw nonetheless and people who will use and store bitcoin in such ways are vulnerable to it.

Yeah I don't like the current nature of smart contracts, or relying on perfect code for an exchange of services, but I'm really fond of the idea of a platform for creating dApps. 
What do you mean by their blockchain is mutable? I thought its immutable because the contracts themselves are immutable.
In terms of profit, I tend to look at percent changes, not just value. I think Ethereum's kept up with Bitcoin for the most part.
@_date: 2019-06-21 16:27:34
Can you elaborate on why you think its centralized?
@_date: 2019-06-21 16:52:10
Hmm seems you're referring to the hack whose bandaging split eth into eth and eth classic. Not sure how that showed how eth lacks censorship resistance, but perhaps more vulnerable than the bitcoin.

Right but why would I pay a fee to buy something with bitcoin when there are no fees in paying with cash

You want me to learn about why bitcoin is better by reading books and watching videos about why bitcoin is better? Lol 
I know what bitcoin is, I know how it works, and I have a pretty good understanding of how the government banking system works, and its flaws. Bitcoin poses many solutions but at the same time, I don't believe in it religiously like some of you in this sub. . "Go learn the truth" ... I'll be "enlightened." It's almost cult-like. It 's really of no use talking to people like that. 
 Its a technology and it may be revolutionary but it isn't perfect and it has its drawbacks, such as the one this post is bringing to attention. I don't understand how a fixed money supply wouldn't be problematic. 
Classical quantity theory of money: 
MV = PY = GDP (money supply × velocity of money = price level × quantity of real good = GDP). If M is fixed and GDP keeps increasing, the value of bitcoin will keep going up (never-ending deflation). There definitely are many negative economical consequences to that, but for some reason bitcoin believers like yourself believe you've got it all figured out. I think ya'll have just deluded yourselves in hopes of winning the lotto.

Sure but I'm not sure why its not reported as 18 million instead of 17.10

Fine, if you're saying instead of amazon paying fees to banks for processing fees they'll pay bitcoin transaction fees that's fair, but is the architecture for this in the bitcoin software yet? I mean who's to say that the consumers won't have to pay fees, only the sellers will? And suppose the consumers also have to pay fees, who's to say the merchants are all of a sudden gonna mark down their prices? 
And what about stuff like sending money, will that incur fees too? I can use my chase quickpay and send money instantly without any fees, same with venmo or any third partt peer to peer cash sending app. Yes if I wanna speed up the transfer I can pay a fee, but I don't have to, and honestly I don't care to. Will the bitcoin network offer me the option of paying a fee or not paying a fee when sending money? Probably not because the transfer is instant and so there's no options.
Bitcoin is definitely not gold. Everything's value is determined by demand. People want gold why? I mean one obvious reason is jewelry. I do see that bitcoin is more secure and that's where it has some physical value but you think the average consumer in even about 100 years will learn or even want to learn about computer security to the point where they actually understand its value. Gold is valuable because society is materialistic and people are dumb. You cannot target such people to educate and teach about why bitcoin is so valuable because frankly most people don't give af. The average consumer will always care more about fancy jewelry.

First of all, I have different perspectives and I'm not going to comment on an old post to restart a discussion that had already ended.
Second of all, what makes you assume I haven't researched this? I clearly know about the common solution to this issue, and other popular rebuttles.
Its not a big deal, but people like you have nothing better to do than report others for harmless conversation, so I understand.

Of course I can, all I have to do is link my credit/debit card. I bought some batteries off the internet a few days ago. As far as I know, I clicked some buttons and amazon got my money.

It's just text on a screen mate. No one's dying and it really isn't that painful to keep scrolling if you've seen something before.
