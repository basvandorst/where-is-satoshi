Tbh drugs probably aren't entirely irrelevant when discussing gold as a medium of exchange. Remove the serial number from a gold bar and you've got yourself something that is valuable and won't have a paper trail associated with it. I assume it's frequently been used a way to launder money in the illicit drug business.

Since you appear to have overlooked that part. It is not unheard of for illegitimate organizations, such as terrorist groups, for example, to use items such as precious metals or other intrinsically valuable materials to fund their operations, as well as to conceal their wealth. 
 There is wealth cleverly hidden all across the world, not exclusively in the US or Europe, often unknown or untouchable by various tax organizations. I'm not claiming that it's always a logistically sensible way to hide, spend, or obtain dirty wealth, especially in places like the US or Europe, but it is not exactly an unheard of practice around the globe, either.

It's a way of hiding wealth in an asset that can reliably be exchanged for cash or other goods, and may not leave an easily traceable paper trail, potentially  concealing the origins of that wealth. It may not help you explain how you payed for your mansion to your local tax service, but it does make dirty money easy to move around. It can also be used to move legitimately obtained funds in an illegitimate fashion or to an illegitimate organization.
