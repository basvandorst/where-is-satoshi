Politifact is the biggest pile of leftist dogshit and to link their completely biased opinions makes you lose all credibility

Neo literally wants to become the matrix of the digital world, (smart economy), it's complementary to all cryptos (cross-chain compatibility) including bitcoin

except it doesnt actually pump new demand into btc, just saps the demand from bch. dont really see how it could pump bitcoin.

You specifically said the dollar value would go up 1k post fork which is just untrue

Emphasis on 'new' demand. Not sure if you're trolling, but your example only results with the decrease in btc/bch exchange rate. As the selling pressure of BCH increases and outweighs the demand of BTH to BCH, it does not actually result in any increase in dollar value of BTC. It isn't even a variable in your example.

You think that is solely because of the fork but it's a bundle of factors. Fundamentally, a fork does not pump the price of the parent chain at all, whatever history may say.

there's been lots of exchange fudding, could be competition from other exchanges for volume dominance, it is how they make money after all.
