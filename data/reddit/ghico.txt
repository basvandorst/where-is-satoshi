How did you educate yourself to trading if I may ask?
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:42:18
Since I'm new to the cryptocurrency field I would like to know which are the other "promising crypto" you bought, and also briefly the reason why you consider them promising.  Thanks a lot!

Thanks, very interesting for someone like me that is new to the realm of cryptocurrencies, I definitely have to do my homework and deepen my knowledge of the field!

This is a little poetry for you  
Give me your bitcoin, I know what to do  
Please be kind and you'll be flooded by good karma  
But even if I don't win I'll make no drama

I'm really not in a hurry of doing so : )
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:39:46
I'm in!

On coinbase you are not getting any bitcoinchas
@_date: 2017-08-31 20:12:22
remember last time something like this happened? 
@_date: 2017-08-06 01:42:14
I'm in!

That tells you how far we still are from any sort of mass adoption!

I might consider my first post here to find the date. What do you think? 
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:04:56
Is there a way for me to know which number of subscriber am I?
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:08:48


Isn't this sort of already happening? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:37:04
Could you tell us how old your Grandpa is?

Is this article yours? I have to say I read it few months ago and shared it on Linkedin cause I find it so much interesting! 
@_date: 2017-04-04 15:08:42
So you see hodling as a positive trend, since it contributes to drive the price up, hopefully until the point where the high value will convince many to adopt and accept it as currency. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 13:26:16
So it seems like its purpose is more oriented towards storage of value, instead than a global adoption and use as international currency, right? 
@_date: 2017-04-03 11:10:14
I'm concerned about the pure "hodling" that everyone mention in here. Doesn't it impede the process of a wider adoption of bitcoin that all of us desire? 
@_date: 2017-04-18 08:59:28
How does it work? It seems interesting!
@_date: 2017-09-17 09:31:20
Which hard fork is coming? 
@_date: 2017-05-19 15:43:54
Hey, I bookmarked this nice graph, and today price went above the top green line.. What's suppose to happen? Crash? 
@_date: 2017-05-24 10:22:52
So he is actually losing money by spending something that would have worth more the next day : )

Thanks for your answer, price is going crazy these last days.. It seems like early late 2013 movements are repeating! Do you think that the price is going to crash and land somewhere in the lines of the graph?
@_date: 2017-05-19 15:33:54
It went above the top green line today! What may this mean? 
@_date: 2017-06-23 10:04:27
I do
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:53:06
You must be a true believer, even at 7$ a coin it would cost 70.000 to buy 10.000 BTC. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 08:34:17
Would you be so kind to explain the advantage of dividing your coins into multiple wallets? Moreover what do you mean by "consolidate"? 
Very interested, if I understand the "why", I might do the same : )
