Yeah, either way I got fucked out of 260 dollars worth of blackjack fun. I think Jaxx really should reimburse me and I haven’t given up hope yet that they will. That’s why I’m posting this in as many relevant subreddits as I can.

What are you talking about?  The link with recommended wallets pulls up a bunch of wallets that are reviewed no better and some worse than Jaxx is. What warnings are you talking about exactly?

Yes, using Jaxx obviously wasn’t a good idea on my part. They’re a Canadian company, they support several different coins, and they have shapeshifter. That’s the main reason I chose them. I still haven’t given up hope that enough public pressure will convince Jaxx to reimburse me, and I also want to make the bitcoin community aware so that this doesn’t happen to anyone else.

Number one the only wallet I talked about is Jaxx. Where do you see me talking about another wallet?  Number two no one deserves to have their money stolen simply because they use a web wallet.  Attitudes like yours are exactly what gives crypto currencies a bad name and de legitimizes them in the eyes of the public.  Thousands of people use Jaxx. Jaxx is also well reviewed in many places on the web. For example check the link I have provided.  That’s just one of many positive reviews for Jaxx from reputable sources. [Jaxx wallet review](

Andrei from customer support claims that since Jaxx is a free platform they cannot reimburse clients for the glitch.  Beware, if it happened to me it could happen to you and you.  Jaxx should not be taking responsibility for peoples hard earned coin if they cannot pay back their glitches, and people in the bitcoin community should be aware that Jaxx is a platform that cannot be trusted.

Look, just because it’s crypto doesn’t mean that companies should be able to get away with stuff like this.  Crypto is never gonna go mainstream if companies like Jaxx can make these kinds of mistakes and not reimburse the customer for them. Idgaf whether you feel sympathy for me or not Froggie. There’s thousands of people who use Jaxx and more new sign ups everyday.  These people should be aware that this happened to me and could just as easily happen to them. I didn’t post this looking for sympathy, I posted this to let the bitcoin community be aware of it and to put public pressure on Jaxx.
