That is really fucked up. I tried to buy bcash at $3100. I’m really mad.

Ugh I'm sorry you had to go through that.  Colonoscopy isn't bad! The prep is funny though because at the end of it you're pooping straight water. Please message me with your results when you get them!

Lol perfect response.

Man you have no idea how much my life changed once my doctor said "you have cancer and if spread across your blood stream already". I am the most laid back person in the world. I hold zero grudges, and life just is so much better when you realize you be six feet deep already. The first thing my doctor told my parent was "you are lucky... he could have died in a car crash like hundreds of people will do today and you wouldn't have been able to say goodbye to him at all which is so true when you think about it. I never thought of it that way but it's so true and chilling. Thanks for the well wishes

I believe that beating cancer is 100% mental. In the beginning I wanted to fuck cancer more than Riley Reid. I went into remission and my sex drive/public fight against cancer went down and cancer came back STRONG in my liver and maybe in my lung. Today I had them stick a camera up my butt and they saw that I had something wrong so they used a balloon to inflate up a part of my bowel that was too tight so hopefully after that fix the pain will be a little less. Sorry for the TMI lol

Congrats first on your health and second on your wealth. Shit, help a person out with the latter lol. I know I will never have my health, but maybe someday I can have money.

this is what he's referring to. 
I've been in the hospital for a while and realized I had a few things that I didn't need. One being a new video game that's $100 with the map pack. I made a this post simply to find someone to send the game to for free. I had my mom send it out earlier in the week and he received it today! I'm a semi-santa just like you, but with a LOT less currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:33:35
Thank you very much. I can use all the prayers I can get. I hope you have a happy and healthy holiday season.

Thank you! It's sad to know that Jobs would most likely be alive right now if he had just gotten regular treatment. That's upsetting.

Hello! I don't want to sound greedy or anything, but I am a 30yo who has been fighting terminal rectal cancer for the past two years. The phrases "I hate my life" or "I want to die" is repeated in my head more than I could ever imagine or care to admit. I've been in the hospital about 450 days out of the past two years, and I am currently writing this message from one. 
I have seriously tried to be the best person I could ever be in the past couple of years. Not for the hope of karma to come help me, but just because there is so much negativity in this world. I just gave away a very new and expensive video game to a random redditor this week because I just didn't need it anymore and wanted to do something nice for a family. 
Earlier in the year my gf of 10+ years left me for someone else and left me empty and crushed. I'm slowly getting out of my depression and I'm also unfortunately about to lose my job (just signed another performance agreement saying I need a certain amount of deals per month or I'll be fired and I'll lose my insurance). 
I just started looking into bitcoin and am very interested in it. If you could PLEASE help me out financially because Cobra insurance is going to destroy me financially and honestly I want to knock off some things off my bucket list before I kick that same bucket. I don't have much but I could come and visit you and make a new friend and just hang out for a day or so just so you can see how genuine of a person I am. 
Well, I hope this gets to you, if not I hope all of you have a rest Christmas, holiday season, and a healthy life. Everyone of you is special and don't ever forget that.

It went well. I woke up in an extreme amounts of pain probably because they did a biopsy. They found a stricture in my lower bowels (think of having a hose with a 1" diameter, and then at one point it goes to 1/2" diameter.  That is what happened due to my radiation I got last year. So When I would try and have a bowel movement I would push extremely hard and it would swell up and sometimes cause vessels to pop open and there would be a pool of blood just coming out. So they put some sort of balloon in there to slowly expand the stricture so I will have an easier time having bowel movements. They aren't sure what the standing pain is though. I might just have A LOT of nerve damage and scar tissue from the radiation. Sorry if that is TMI. 
Monday I go in for an MRI to try and see if there was anything they missed. I'll be in the hospital for a while most likely. This sucks. I have no girlfriend to be next to me every night like there used to be, I'm in pain or I'm going to get addicted to this fucking medicine again (the opioid epidemic is the most fucked up thing ever) or else i'm in pain, I can't work, I can't hang out with friends, and I can't even eat real food due to my bowels. Shit sucks man. Cars are really the only thing that I have a huge interest in and my dream is to own a Nissan GTR before I pass away. I honestly Don't care if I"m on my death bed, I will call a dealer and buy that car. Damnit, now I'm sad because a 30yo with my personality and previous way of life should never have to live like this. I cry when I feel like I have to go to the bathroom because I know the pain that is about to take over my body. Mind you I used to be a full scholarship division 1 baseball pitcher who was the life of the party. Now I can't even show up to a party. God please help me and my life as I go on. Cancer is the biggest piece of shit god ever created, but without a second of thought I would live this life 10000000000000000x over if that meant a cure was to come out for everyone else.

Oh, I forgot, if you cared about how my scans went today here is a link. It's actually in this subreddit lol.

Hey! Thank you SO much for your genuine proposal. My BTC address is 1G4MPbBUhozRqEwF4PXaTFHGcyshFrjJTh 
I think I did that correct. I'm kinda new to the whole bitcoin thing. 
Thank you also for the prayers. I can use all I can get right about now. The pain meds aren't as sufficient as I would like them to be :( 
Bless you and your family.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:51:46
No problem man. I hope you like it. I'm not sure if you can use the expansion pack kit I bought but I'll look for that piece of paper with the code on it when I get discharged.

I've been having edibles each day from my cousins in Florida and Colorado and they make my pain 10000% better. I'm going to start doing the oils also. Shit I'll try anything. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:44:52
Thank you. I have soooo many people pulling for me. I am just upset that I can't afford the car. All day I lay in bed. All day I lay in bed looking at GTR's. My dream day would be me, My dad, my stepdad, and my mom to bring MY GTR to the track and run low 10's maybe even 9's! If I died on the ride home from that track day I would be the happiest person not alive lol. I just wish I had money. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:47:54
Thank you! I try and be the absolute best person I can be. Everyone who knows me knows that I would drop everything for anyone in any situation. I just wish bitcoin would be doing better. 
I'm talking with my dad now about which cars we can get and work on together. Any suggestions?

I made a transaction from a wallet to coinbase on the 10th and it still hasn't shown up in my account. It is only .16 BTC but you bet your ass that after the lack of response except for a shitty template email response that I will be taking legal action against Coinbase. I don't understand how a company can be so inept at doing their sole purpose. 
Maybe you can get a better answer for me? 
Here is the address that I sent my BTC to: 1MiyncvxXxNuvUmYGYWatK4L12LHSN2eDF

You guys are great. Let's hope for $20k+ by the end of the weekend!
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:06:13
I'm so sorry for your loss. Time is so precious. It really is. I just hope I get the chance to do so before my time expires :( I can't complain here. I'm 100% sure you'd rather be in my situation than the one you are in right now. All I need is money, but you need to turn back the hands of time. I'm sorry once again. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:50:18
Thank you. :)

Thank you so much. The scan went well and I can't wait until I hear from my doctor again on the plan that they come up with! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:09:27
Haha that gave me a little chuckle. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:29:26
Mannnn you're going to be ok!!!! Don't worry about it. You know how these things go. Two months, yeah right, more like two hundred months! Lmk how your PET was (mine was supposed to be a PET earlier in the week but got changed to a CT for some reason).  
Ps Fuck Contrast lol.

I've taken Gabapentin for nerve pain and I think they are going to keep me on that once i'm out of the hospital. I guess we will see. Thank you so much for the information.

THANK YOU. All these people saying you can’t lambo everywhere are completely wrong. I know people who drove their lambos in the snow all the time and this past weekend went on an exotic car rally and the mclarens could travel on roads that most of the other cars couldn’t because it could lift itself three inches with the push of a button.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 02:37:54

I hate Peoples Bank more than anything. I tried to buy coins in Feb but their auth deposits never showed up so I couldn't link my bank account. I was going to buy three coins. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:00:14
Omg imagine if a company like Coinbase was hacked? What would happen to the US economy? /s
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:06:00
I got a payout of $10k last January and was going to buy a couple of coins because I liked the idea of it. Unfortunately my shit fuck bank couldn’t see the two small verification deposits so after fighting with them I got frustrated and stopped my account signup. :( I would have had a nice amount of money on my hands
