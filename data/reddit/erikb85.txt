There are websites where you can pledge a few bucks to a personal goal. If you don't reach your personal goal (e.g., lose 10 kg in 3 months) your money gets send to some charity. Don't know if that exists for bitcoin, but would make sense. Even with small amounts it helps to motivate.

The basic idea was that to make a transaction work you need to mine, so to get your transactions through you make it more interesting by adding a fee. After all "new" coins are mined transaction fees are the thing that should fund the mining and the mining should provide the foundation for transactions.
I think it is flawed, though. When the fees for mining drop too much too long, less people will mine. This doesn't influence at all how often transactions get through, because the difficulty will adapt. So you don't pay a fee to get your transaction through. What you are actually paying for is keeping your bitcoin network tamper safe by having as many miners as possible. But people seldomly pay for their safety even if it is necessary. For an example look at the OpenSSH problems and underfunding that was only receiving some publicity because of the Heartbleed bug. Everybody needs OpenSSH to be save (even people who have nothing to do with computers, because your bank, your doctor, your police, your traffic light control, your tv, everything uses it). But nobody pays for the safety. I think it might become the same with bitcoins. Reward drops to zero, transaction fee doesn't get up, people stop mining, attacks on the network get quite easy.

Don't misunderstand me. That a big part of the Bitcoin community considerds Bitcoin the killer of traditional banking I understand. But because you define someone an enemy he doesn't have to do the same thing back.  Our middle school soccer club had Manchester United as our sworn enemy. I bet even today Manchester United has never even heard about us. Or if they have, they might at best consider us a resource they could use to discover new talents for their future teams. You know what I mean?

What's the official reasoning behind this? Have I not seen it or is none stated in the links? There are so many possible reasons. I think a bank discontinuing business with an annoying customer is way more likely than banks unifying to fight something like Bitcoin.

Thanks for the reply. I think it's okay if search doesn't work for now. But how do I find any product? Even though it's beta I'd be willing to risk it and purchase small, digital products. But if I can't find a shop or a product there is no chance for that, obv.

With OpenBazaar I always had the problem that I couldn't find any products by search (maybe not creative enough) and I didn't find any other way to see what others offer. Does anybody know if this has changed?

I love it and consider it a correct representation of what bitcoin is about.
Please don't change it!
