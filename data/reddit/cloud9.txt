It's a trap. It's just a way for the government to identify who has crypto. You'll see many more States do the same.

It only took them 8 YEARS to begin to ask the question... /smh
This FORCED spending 2% inflationary policy has be slowly wound down towards a 0-1% and if you're going to sell me on "job creation" (most of which goes abroad nowadays), then hell, why don't we just pump it up to 4% inflationary policy? How about everyone at the Fed get a free copy of Hayek's work and aim for stable money? (instead of running those printing presses and stealing from the 99%).
While we're at it, lets get rid of (or at least reduce) that 6% the banks get for participating in the Federal Reserve system since it's REQUIRED BY LAW that national banks participate.
And how about setting policy aimed at the 99% instead of Wall St.?
At least Iceland threw its banksters in jail whereas we pay them off to mitigate the damage THEY CREATED!
Fortunately, we now have a choice - crypto. Thank you Satoshi! The banksters haven't had competition in 400 years - it's about time!

Some people buy crypto steel and save that seed in their own lockbox which they then store in a bank's safe deposit box.
Then you find out all this is for $100 worth of bitcoin.

I'm aware what it was 3 years ago. Hopefully it'll rise enough for them to recover the cost of crypto steel and ongoing costs of a safe deposit box at the bank.
Personally, I think it's overkill for $100 investment.

I see healthcare remains an unresolved issue in 2025 as 31 Sats still seems quite expensive...

They did you a favor. 
I mean really, what has Citibank done for you for the past 20yrs?
