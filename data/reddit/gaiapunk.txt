This is a sad day but it will not shake the faith of those of us who believe in digital rights and in general freedom.
 I also wanted to add just for accuracy sake at this moment Flattr isn't taking bitcoin funds due to technical issues but plans to do so again once those issues are resolved.  Although it has some small faults to overcome in general Flattr is a revolutionary service that has supported thousands of artists and creators without coercion or ads.  Heml.is is a encrypted messaging app is another project Peter is directly involved in and also worth checking out. Peter is a really great guy and this is not the end of his work by no means.  We should support him by recommiting our efforts to an open, accessible, and safe interwebs.
BTW Peter doesn't love taxes for taxes sake he just believes that social safety nets and public infrastructure are good things worth supporting.

Wow,  
The co-founder of Zapier just replied to a comment I made within one minute of me making it; this takes the idea of a responsive customer centric startup to a whole new level.

For all the doubters of Flattr out there I can tell you that Flattr is succeeding in the countries where it's popular (Germany and Sweden).  Growth has been slower in the US due to large platforms (Twitter and Apple) not allowing Flattr better integration and because Peter has been locked up.  Peter is the primary reason the app is popular in Germany because he was able to talk about it at conferences while he was living in Berlin.  The next version of Flattr will be easier to used and mobile focused.

Zapier is actually a much better service than IFTTT I would contact them.

Thank you, yeah I really like using Typeform they made it easy to make much better than Google Forms or Survey Monkey.

Well the idea was for new years but there is a fair chance they will be published early.

Honestly, engineers and designers are not thinking about the cognitive resources that people don't have the time or desire to spend when they are just trying to pay for things or their employees. If the LN can't be simplified for the end user it's DOA.

Nope, don't care to explain or likely won't understand in super fine detail any of that, but also I have other stuff to do, still a nice reply.

Flattr has always felt like paypal is the deathstar of payments and that bitcoin is sort of the rebel alliance.  The only reason we didn't accept BTC earlier is there was no way to do it without huge risks for our service caused by volatility; luckily things have changed a lot thanks to services such as Bitpay and Walletbit.  We are excited to see what is possible and as soon as we have any new announcements in this regard will be the first to know.  I'm always available to answer questions as best that I can, thank you guys.

The Bitcoin bot on Reddit is really awesome by the way, thanks for the tips makes my job exciting!

I like BTC but what is the victory here? Doesn't this show that everyday (non speculative) transactions in BTC haven't gotten any easier now many years into development?

Avalon is not a scam, if you saw Yifu's talk at Bitcoin 2013 you  would know he is a upstanding individual for a number reasons.

I really loved the Coinlab tracker and now I'm checking around for something as good anybody have a favorite? Overall, this is bad, bad news, (especially for MT gox which is getting nothin' but flack from the community now) Anyhow I'm looking forward to Buttercoin (p2p exchange) development taking off; something as important as a central exchange can't be trusted to just one or two companies.  Vote Pirate!

Our backend uses euros also there is a massive risk for our company when holding bitcoin longterm do to volatility.  That is why we need the payment provider to handle the coins for us, just like WP and OKC use bitpay to do so I believe, and to make sure our user can cash out from their Flattr dashboards into bitcoin....make sense?  We want this to happen we just want to do it right.

If you guys like bitcoin tip be sure to check out fleddit.org too!  It's a Flattr, Reddit mashup that works in much the same way.
@_date: 2013-08-31 19:04:04
This feature has actually already been built and it works very well check out r/fleddit and r/tippit for more info!
PS.  I do biz dev with Flattr and we've had talks with Reddit, they like Flattr but are wary of changing too many things about Reddit at once.  Gold was a big leap and in time they may take others.

I work as a Biz Dev with the startup Flattr and I'm going down to the Con and will be there for the GigaOm meetup on Thurs.  My friend Cory and I have a place to crash in Oakland but it would be nice not to have to drive back and forth to San Jose, if anyone wants to be our private airbnb host that would be rad, just msg me.

As long as it gets you around all the bases it's prophylactic potentials shouldn't be a issue.

Hi, I'm Evan, a Biz Dev advisor for Flattr.
I was recently in San Jose, CA at the Bitcoin 2013 conference scouting for providers and basically there were very few providers that could guarantee transactions both ways.  What I mean by this is users would load up Bitcoins, the provider would take those bitcoins and then give Flattr euros and finally when a user wants to withdraw on their Flattr account they would then get the option to withdraw in bitcoins.  It is this last step that is difficult.  I got a unlikely maybe from Bitpay, a unlikely maybe from coinbase, a "i think so" yes from Charlie Shrem with Bit Instant, and a maybe yes from a Sweedish exchange outfit.  If anyone is aware of a provider that can certainly handle Flattr's needs they can reach me at evan (at) flattr.com .  Until we find the appropriate provider bitcoin integration may be on hold....
PS. If you're a fan of BTC tip on reddit (as I am) also be sure to check Fleddit, a Flattr, reddit, mashup and the r/tippit community!
