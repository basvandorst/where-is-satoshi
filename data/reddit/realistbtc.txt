tonal bitcoin support is still missing from Core ? after all this time ?! damn ! real development must really have stopped up there ! i don't know why they are loosing time with silly problems when the fundamentals are still not ready ! /s

I would like to see an opt-in keccak PoW , off course .
activable with --nuclearpow in command line or .conf file .

no ! value of bitcoin was meant to be increasing too , with increasing adoption and so increasing number of transactions .
instead , crippling the network with artificially self imposed limits create all kind of issues .

satoshi genius was in the '' grand scheme '' of bitcoin, so much that a lot of people at the time (or some time after ) did't think it could actually work.
details like this, or the max block size limit , are instead just technicality, that any less visionary, but dedicated and competent developer can spot and fix for the better .
@_date: 2016-01-25 14:58:54
wait ! that would mean that **all the nodes running luke-jr Bitcoin version** will use a different PoW starting April ? All **5 -- FIVE** of them ?!
we are doomed !! /s

and what does it mean ? one could also be a silly one for years ..
@_date: 2016-01-28 16:55:10
it was a pretty silly kind of request by ' some ' miner .
@_date: 2016-01-25 19:17:35
sorry , none of those pdfs are relevant to the case in point .
but check this . trojan.badminer come up around august, 2011 ( google it ) . it included a cpu and gpu miner. obviously at that time it was already not that useful, because fpga and asic were already going on . 
today botnet of 100,000 pcs are so common that they don't even make much news , execpt from security dedicate channels . add 5 years of code evolution . 
i'll let you imagine the rest ..

i'm very glad to see you writing this , really. and distancing Core from what was going on with the silly censoring of and bitcoin.org was a great move in that sense. thanks ! hope we could put away even the last barrier soon , with a little compromise on the block size .
@_date: 2016-01-19 13:01:07
, you may learn something here . really, consider contracting a guy like this one before you come out with your next statement .
@_date: 2016-01-27 11:37:19
well , I believe it ! you simpathize with the people from the holy inquisition , which had a far more radical approach with matters of free speech , after all .
@_date: 2016-01-25 16:48:47
you think that there are no plenty of botnets of computers with powerful gpu ? you need to educate yourself better on the subject, then .
@_date: 2016-01-29 22:32:29
i'm sure you'll get plenty of technically correct answers that will make no sense . months ago a transaction moving some relevant fractions of bitcoin like this would have confirmed with 0 fee with no problems . and that's a fact .
@_date: 2016-01-26 22:35:03
it is ! but he has covered his bases to have a legitimate excuse . he's crafty like that .

'that would be an alt-coin and therefore is inacceptable" - thermos
'that would lead to miner centralization" - nullc
'does it come with tonal ? also , change pow" - luke-jr

pherhaps if the current Core team wasn't being such a smart **ass** and used a bit less hubris , that would haven't been necessary .
@_date: 2016-01-31 13:58:56
i recommend nothing less than 105% , because consensus and ethos !
@_date: 2016-01-25 14:44:45


Are you kidding ? there are plenty of botnet in the wild right now that count more machines than the actual number of nodes . actually, they surpass that number but at least an order of magnitude . this is madness .
@_date: 2016-02-11 17:43:55


as long as we do like I say .
that some special kind of logic, right there .
@_date: 2016-02-15 15:59:54
how can you misconstruct this ? where's the ethos and professionalism that you so often call for ?
he stepped down from his position of **LEAD DEVELOPER** , that doesn't mean it isn't a **DEVELOPER** any more !!
@_date: 2016-02-10 11:44:55
adam back should like the part that mention him !
@_date: 2016-02-11 18:00:53
got a title for your next one : "Adam's back" !
@_date: 2016-02-11 18:04:11
bram cohen , the man who said : " today I will shit on cryptocurrency in general " - a true wise man .
actually , he was especially angry with the wastes of PoW , which is basically the only ( involuntary ) contribution of Adam Back to Bitcoin. 
so, guys : are you sure you want this as one of your paladins ?
proof : 
@_date: 2016-02-13 19:54:22
now let see if some huge holder from bitcoinocracy place some bets !
@_date: 2016-02-01 18:23:04
that remind me something.. wait was it block size ? uhm ... no... can't be... right ?
@_date: 2016-02-01 18:22:07
link up or shut up : your choice !
@_date: 2016-02-01 11:18:03
frankly it become nonsense starting at point 1 ; then it get worse .
