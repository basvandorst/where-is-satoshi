Yes.  And 'virtual currency BUSINESSES' are defined quite a bit more broadly than you seem to think.  It doesn't have to be a business in the normal sense.  Any type of exchange qualifies.

In section 26000(c)(2) of this bill. where it specifically defines "virtual currency business".

This law is insane.  There is no minimum limit to how trivial the 'business of virtual currency' can be.  If we go out to dinner and split the bill, and I send you $10 online to cover my part, and you put a ten dollar bill down, that's a felony.  It doesn't matter if it's one dollar, it's illegal.
There's an exception for paying for goods and services. So theoretically, I could send bitcoins to the restaurant directly, and that'd be okay.  But what would the restaurant do with the bitcoins?  They can't cash out without a license.  Maybe they could use a service like Bitpay, if Bitpay had a California license, which they currently don't.

So if I give you 50 mbtc and you give me 10 dollars, somehow that's not 'conversion or exchange of virtual currency into fiat currency' ?


The wording seems pretty clear to me.
