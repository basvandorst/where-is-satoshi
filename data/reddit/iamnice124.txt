Who likes the buy for jumping in a long position right now? 6PM ET.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:40:14
I bought in with roughly 1k USD when BTC hit $6,666.
Too early? Too late? Right on time?
Your thoughts?
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:36:13
Easy easy lol. Obviously he invested at an inopportune time, not need to get overly prideful over a crypto that you value. He’s not attacking you, he’s airing frustration.

I can’t exchange USD for Monero in Gdax
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:48:37
BTC rn 
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:50:29
Where’s your ceiling for the next month? Any guesses as to where (if) it ends? 
@_date: 2017-11-07 02:01:21
Lol I’m just not at home, I’d be on my pc if I was. 
A secure wallet for my home computer, with an internal exchange if possible. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:44:40
I will say this, LTC is holding nicely at the $52-$53 range. Not a bad time to jump in there before the fork. I don’t see it going too much lower than it is currently. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:46:54
Fair point.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:14:33
Just dumped everything for BTC lol. Gonna watch this shit go right back up! 
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:23:31
can someone explain replay protection?
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:15:37
Long-term bro. You gon make mula!
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:59:50
You need to observe BTC from a separate lens. There’s a reason the rest are called ALTs. 
I’m no BTC snob, but I’ve learned that rather quickly. The entire crypto market is so, so heavily influenced by BTC, and often times in a converse manner.
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:54:08
Well, this is for a short margin pick as of right now. BTC just dropped from 7.6k down to 7k in a day. I'm lookin to make a quick margin before reinvesting into a few of my ALTs. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:46:37
Totally. Where do you see LTC/ETH going soon? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:54:55
Well shit! Let me sell my house, car, use my 401k, and auction my children off! I needs me more capital!
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:37:08
That was not the brightest move, man. Investing late on runs is not the right idea. $330 was a peak, not a valley. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:43:10
Yeah I feel you. It’s such a crap shoot lol.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:52:37
What wallet do you suggest??
@_date: 2017-11-18 06:46:26
If it doesn’t hit $10k, I️ volunteer to pay him the full difference of $10k/BTC and whatever his holdings are totaled at, just to see him eat his left ball. Just to be clear, his left ball is his left testicle, not some ball he referred to in a pun. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:40:01
What’s the best method for exchanging for Monero??
I’m running a wallet that doesn’t support it at the moment.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:47:03
I’m a FunFair supporter, and this truly hits the nail on the head. 
I’m well aware FUN is worth jack shit right now, but I’m not concerned with it’s current price, I’m concerned with the outlook of the underlying concept, and those who are spearheading it. I think it’s a winning concept, and if marketed and sold properly could revolutionize online gambling. 
BTC is obviously more prominent, and influential, but this game is going to reward the folks with the best foresight, and understand exactly what it is they’re truly investing in, no matter if they’re invested in BTC, BCH, or shitcoins like FUN. 
Great post, OP. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:07:12
$1,000,000 for one BTC? That seems like quite a stretch.. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:03:37
You’re going to make money, just don’t bail! HODL!

“Man this steak smells great, mind passing me a fork? ...fork... fork... Shit, fork! Fork! FORK FORK FORK!!!!”

When supply and demand plays a major role in the value of an asset, and that asset can be exchanged as easily as an open source currency that isn’t regulated, what stops a billionaire tycoon from opening his/her mouth and playing currency god by steering speculation?
BTC isn’t only for middle to lower income individuals. Just because  banks and governments aren’t regulating these things doesn’t mean they won’t have a massive impact on that as CCs become more prominent. 
This seemed like an extremely trivial concept...
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:00:17
Who the hell didn’t think that was the case from the start?
@_date: 2017-10-31 16:33:46
I’m so fucking pissed I’m not invested in BTC still. I’m the dumbest of dumbfucks.. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:05:32
Actually, you’re just buying expensive shit to solve complex math problems. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:21:29
Not that I disagree with him, but Peter Thiel is a fuck nugget. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 22:02:20
If BTC takes a big hit from the fork, what’s the likely outlook for ETH and LTC? Conversely, will those two likely trend upward along with BTC if the fork proves to be a positive event?
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:32:15
This is how a prominent investment figure manipulates a decentralized currency. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:20:47
Why you spelling *check* two different ways? You fuckin me up, dawg. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 03:27:19
Need some help here. I’m buying soon, hopefully after it dips below $6k soon, but I need a wallet and some setup advice, as I currently hold 16.5 LTC on Coinbase, but I’d rather convert that to BTC, then transfer to a Wallet. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 14:41:05
Well, I’ve lost money, so fuck all of you lol. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 12:42:09


Yeaaaahhh, ummmm, banks aren’t very transparent, my dude.
The block chain is designed to protect consumer interests by virtue of anonymity, and *actual* transparency; banks most certainly do *not* operate on that basis.
@_date: 2017-07-13 00:35:18
Aaaaand there goes *his* job.
@_date: 2018-12-25 15:59:50
Or you could recognize that it’s a bunch of manipulated bullshit that operates no differently than a casino. You’re just gambling. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 13:13:07
I think it’s because people are realizing how unreliable an unregulated security is. You’re all treating this thing like nothing other than a security, instead of its intended purpose and utility. It’s not going to go anywhere, figure it out..
