I noticed the lights were still on in here, hello?
@_date: 2014-11-05 05:18:45
Thanks! :D
@_date: 2016-06-14 13:06:54
Thanks, I just changed the settings, restarted, but no dice, seems to be the same speed. I don't have great bandwidth tho, am on copper internet...

Thanks, I tried those solutions and after fiddling with how to import my old wallet.dat I thought I may as well be syncing. Is it possible to import other wallet.dat files or are they for starting a new wallet?

People lose a fuckton of money. Obscurantism.

I thought Paypal charges fees to only one party.

Jeez, bunkers, islands and weapons, are their coke dealers diversifying or something?

So sad. It is a use thing, but the instability of the trading is causing this, I mean it could be worth 900 dollars today, 800 tmr. The people actually using the coin are often too high level, and their impact splashes the rest of us.
EDIT: Altho, hopefully too many Whales will lose too much and we might get stability again.

I think the government takes technology very seriously, they don't want to be left behind, or be seen as regressive in this field. If folks loose their asses over this bitcoin stuff its the state that has to pick up/deal with the pieces. Gambling is illegal. Stock markets are relatively new in China, they are regulated, just like they want Bitcoin trades to be. Ultimately, investigation needs to happen, and the subterfuge of fake trades may hide a lot.

So... you are suggesting only Chinese use exchanges in China? I mean who else would use the worlds top exchanges, with massive volume? Only the Chinese obviously, cos only the Chinese live and work in China, and the internet doesn't exist, or virtual offices in Hong Kong etc.

It's nearly Chinese new year. BRIBE TIME!
TLDR: Everyone hits you up before CNY.

Will my family know I've been replaced by a robot? Creepy.

Sad to hear. I use Bitcoin on Steam and I know Humble bundle are another high profile user. Do you mind me asking what field your software serves?
@_date: 2017-01-08 00:48:03
They still, at the least at a superficial level, have the public's interest at heart in warning them, and warning the exchanges to sort out fake trading.

Brilliant everyday story. Altho, you're out of luck if some whale decides to dump.

Trading incurs capital gains tax, cannot be bothered with working that out, what am I an accountant?  HODL on!
EDit: Added the word tax.

The market? Bs, complete bs. The free market is run by and manipulated by the rich for the benefit of the rich. It doesn't work. The market's fuckup just put the world in debt. Brilliant.

I can't believe this is even a question. It's magical internet money. OP raised a very relevant issue and you say why not use a competitor to bitcoin. Bitcoin is so incredibly easy to use, easier than Paypal. I think this is an argument about access, bitcoin accesses the world, it is boundaryless. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 12:48:01
v0.12.1(64-bit) which I believe is the latest. I am currently 2 years behind... been running now for 3 hours or more.

@_date: 2017-01-09 13:56:26
Thanks, yeah, was thinking at the v. least they could lose the fees. If this is an ongoing issue, they need to state info about it, I see nothing on their site recognising it, or didn't, other than a warning about Paypal.

He's going to announce that Putin gives Trump a stipend paid in bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-01-24 13:00:50
Yeah, toxic bonds, labyrinthine financial structures, massive state debt due to financial market malpractice, yeah, regulation, such an amazingly evil thing /s
@_date: 2017-01-13 15:46:01
Did not need to see. lol
@_date: 2017-01-25 12:59:51
Terrible argument. You are seriously suggesting bitcoin is a luxury good?
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:49:09
That is meant to make people feel better?! xD
