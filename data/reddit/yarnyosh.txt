Youy\ are totally misinterpreting what I am saying here.  I am not stating support for bch nor am I indicating that there are any fundamentals behind it.  I am simply saying that hard forks are an important function in bitcoin and the cryptocurrency world.  Hard forking is a mechanism that keeps the crypto space evolving.  
@_date: 2018-01-23 17:09:18
Ok well to each his own. But it’s a shame you are so closed minded that you can’t even have a respectable discussion/ debate.  Also, comparing  bch supporters to flat earthers is a bad and inaccurate comparison.
@_date: 2018-01-23 16:21:12
Exactly 
@_date: 2018-01-23 12:03:09
You gotta stop focusing on bashing bch.  Hard forking is a mechanism of bitcoin, and an important one at that.   Bch isn’t trying to attack bitcoin.  Bch hard fork is simply bitcoin working as it was designed to work.  Start embracing the hard fork mechanism rather than being so butthurt.  Focus on the future of bitcoin and how to scale properly

What I said in a previous post has nothing to do with the comment that we are debating.  My hard fork comment was meant to be neutral and not meant to be a jab at btc.  I love btc because crypto would be nothing without it.  I simply wanted to express the notion that hard forks, to me, are a wonderful function of the bitcoin concept.  It’s a natural part of blockchain tech, and from an observation standpoint, I find the hard fork element a fascinating part of crypto.  The whole crypto space would have evolved the way it did without the possibility of hard forks.   That being said, your sleuthing skill is good.  I do support bch and I do believe it has fundamentals, but that is a separate debate.

I just saw a news story about the guy who started the Area 51 raid.  He said in the interview that he meant it as a joke and he hopes no one gets hurt.  He then said he is working on turning the event into some sort of a fun party/gathering with music and art.  When asked about the area 51 raids, the bitcoin time traveler guy from the other day said that it turns into a traditional, fun, alien themed festival that takes place every year.

Back when bitcoin was just one coin, there were two bitcoin subs.  As the scaling debate began dividing the community, people on one side of the debate began to gravitate to the btc sub, while folks on the other side of the debate began to gravitate to rbitcoin .  This makes sense because humans tend to favor people who agree with them and confirm their beliefs.   Then the fork happened.   Bch had their campaign of ‘bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin’.   Since bch people believe this, they never felt the need to hange the name of he sub because it aligns with their beliefs and their marketing slogan.

We rotate around a giant energy source.  If we powered ourselves with sustainable, renewable energy then this wouldn’t be a problem.  But the greed of corporations to control the power supply has set us back so far in terms of finding and applying newer and cleaner energy sources.

These types of posts are repetitive but crucial.  People just wanna talk about bitcoin, and then they want to wait around and hope that businesses and merchants just magically accept bitcoin one day.  It's up to us not only to tell merchants to use bitcoin but to use bitcoin ourselves.  
For instance, I have a friend who loves bitcoin.  We discuss crypto all the time.  The other day, i owed him money for food.  I asked him if he preferred that I pay in bitcoin, bitcoin cash, or ethereum.  he declined and said he'd rather I just venmo him.  This is unacceptable, and I let him know that.
If we want bitcoin, or any cryptocurrency to be adopted, we need to use it for everyday transactions.  Bitcoin must become the main trade piece that everyone uses.  We must use bitcoin every chance we get.  If you owe your friend for food, pay them back in crypto.  If a friend owes you for food, accept crypto in return.  
This goes beyond just food.  If you are selling a car, renting a room, splitting bills, buying weed/alcohol, performing a service for someone....basically any transaction that can happen between humans you know, must happen in crypto.  If we just sit around and wait for businesses to adopt it, it will never work.

Because he felt that the price was going to go down.  Which brings me to another point...how people need to stop trading bitcoin.  Sell if you really need to, but people need to stop treating this as if its a casino game.  We need less traders and scalpers and more holders, spenders, and believers

I'm a Dallas mavericks fan and used to love Cuban.  Since then I've lost respect for him.  Besides the fact that he dismantled a champion team and hasn't made a good basketball move in 7 years, his statement on Bitcoin really rubbed me the wrong way.   His comment was a sneaky attempt to manipulate the market so he could get a better entry.  He knew what he was doing and he knew the effect his statement would have.  He also knew Bitcoin wasn't going to crash anytime soon.  It was very devious what he did.  I only still root for the mavs because if Dirk

Stop now, no it’s not.  Posts like this are worse than BSV and BCH combined.  I get that bch should not be claiming to be the ‘real bitcoin ‘. That is bad for the whole space.  But is been well over a year now and people need to just accept the fact that forks exist and so do many altcoins.  Just focus on scaling and adoption and no need to keep making silly, repetitive ‘bcash’ posts like it’s 2017.   All people really want is a working, decentralized alternative to the lousy fiat system of exchange.
@_date: 2019-04-04 10:16:51
Yes exactly.  I hold bitcoin from many years ago but I am afraid it will lose to another coin if these later two solutions don’t happen fast.  And by ‘happen’ I mean easy and usable for the average joe

Put my nose where I wasn’t called?  You made a public post on a social media website.  Therefore you basically invited anyone on reddit to ‘put their nose’ in your conversation.  You post is the same as countless others that have been made in the last 20 or so months since the bch hardfork.  We’ve all heard your same points and arguments many many times before.  Give it a rest.  Your post didn’t provide any valuable information or insight, it just parroted common points others have made repeatedly in the past

You dense fool.  You are so consumed with your lame bcash = bad post that you didn’t even care to try to understand my comment before replying.  Never one did I say that bch is a decentralized alternative to fiat.  I just said that a decentralized alternative to fiat is what people want.  After all, that’s why we all got in the bitcoin/crypto space to begin with.  And although you will just have to take my word for it, I am not a ‘bcasher ‘. I dont hold any bch at the current moment
@_date: 2019-04-13 19:17:08
Based on what?   
I think the real issue here is that you have no intelligent or insightful points to add to any real bitcoin conversation, so you come to r/bitcoin and make some ‘agreeable post’ full of buzzwords in an attempt to get some karma points.  And since you have no fresh/unique info to add, all you can do is make a repetitive post and call people ‘bcashers’

The real point is that there is no way bitcoin is going back to all time highs anytime soon.  Lightning is still far from being ready and user friendly.  Not many relevant business accept it.  Regulation is still iffy.  This price boost is just a manipulated pump.  
@_date: 2019-04-04 09:58:24
That’s great but this type of transaction needs to be easy and user friendly, and it needs to happen fast.  Right now, I am trying to teach family members about bitcoin before our trip overseas.  Right now, trying to teach my mom how to open lightning channels and use the network is more complicated than just teaching her how to use bitcoin cash.  I know I’ll probably get downvotes for this but it’s the truth right now.  I’ve been in the crypto space for a long time and it’s about time bitcoin is used regularly if we want to see the monetary change we all aspire to

The difference is simple.   Bitcoin is finite.  So the price is backed by the pure demand for the product.  Fiat is infinite.  It can be printed at will to meet or exceed demand, therefore breaking the fundamental supply/demand aspect.

Its because they can't use it themselves.  I have been trying to preach to friends and family about bitcoin, and I even gave people bitcoin as gifts.  But where I am from, there are very few opportunities to use it.  When I did try and use it to show my brother and dad how it worked, the transaction was unfortunately unconfirmed for about 45-60 minutes  and the fee was about $1.  It obviously didn;t impress my brother and dad and I started telling them about lightning.  But by the time I began to tell them about lightning, they had lost interest and deemed crypto as overcomplicated.
In short, people don't get its potential, because potential is all bitcoin has right now.  It still lacks usability and ease of entry for new users.  I'm sorry to say, but I have been a bitcoin fan since early 2015 and I the 2019 version of bitcoin has been letting me down.  But don;t worry, I am not switching to BCH, but i am probably going to put most of my faith now in ethereum

yea sorry.  2014 was a typo on my new phone.  But yea I converted to bch on 8/26/17  I rode the wave up through the coinbase listing and made tons of $.  Since then, I have sold my BCH near the top and have been re-acquiring crypto during the bear market.  As I re -bought , I went mostly btc and eth.  But lately, as mentioned, I have been dissapointed with btc.  I still hold some btc, and no longer hold any bch.  I actually almost no longer see the point in having a crypto functioning as exclusively money.  Lately I have envisioned a future of value transfer through utility tokens and a future world of a tokenized economy.

Lightning will not work and become mainstream until there is a wallet that is extremely user friendly.  Putting btc on lightning and opening channels needs to be so easy, an old person can do it.  Right now, I can’t even get a good wallet for my iPhone.  
@_date: 2018-12-05 12:02:05
Yea I guess I’m just being impatient.   When lightning got introduced, I wasn’t to keen on the idea given the steps you had to go through just to make payments.  Then over time I began to really see the merit in LN as long as it is extremely user friendly.  I am just so eager to start using it so I can once again show others how easy and awesome btc is
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:46:05
Definitely not a master trader, and I definitely did not time the market perfectly.  But there was a point where crypto was falling from the top, and I needed cash because I was about to buy a house, so I sold my bch holdings while the price was still respectable.  Not really uncommon, and many people who don;t even know how to trade can figure out that when your investment is worth a lot, take some cash if you need it for living.
