Are you suggesting this comic strip is fake?

There's thousands and thousands of predictions out there. At some point one of them is going to be correct. The problem is that you can't know beforehand which one.

They'd be out of business pretty soon if they stole people's money. You got probably hacked.

He was 5'9" (175cm) which was probably average height at that time.

They can just use mBTC or satoshis. Obviously it's a bit harder than dollars and cents but there's absolutely no need to use the scientific notation.

They should also be in physically separate places to avoid getting destroyed by fire, flood, tornado, etc.

It seems that math works a bit differently on r/bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-26 11:59:55
You misunderstood (probably on purpose so that you could get offended you sad fucker).
The analogy is more like "it gets better as it ages". It has nothing to do with transacting.

A lot of people are photographers. It doesn't make this photo any less fake though.

OP is a complete tool.

There is some deeper meaning in this that I quite can't grasp.
@_date: 2019-04-02 10:34:49
To be honest, I'd rather take the random guess than hearing it from yet another self-proclaimed bitcoin expert.
@_date: 2019-04-23 13:42:13
This the most popular subdiscussion in this Daily Discussion thread, so apparently a lot of people care.

ELI5 what does it mean that the Lightning network capacity is x dollars?
@_date: 2019-08-06 09:29:48
How many US dollars would one need to own to join the 10 million club for USD?
@_date: 2019-04-03 09:06:21
Then they will just make you pay the equal amount in dollars.

Soo... fast food chain wants to adopt Coca-Cola?

It makes me wonder what does stuff cost there. Let's say in the US you'll spend $100 a week on food. How much would an equivalent amount of food cost in Venezuela?

It makes kind of sense. Would you buy a golden egg laying goose before it has laid any eggs or after?
@_date: 2019-04-05 07:28:29
Well, then you owe the money. It's not like the justice system hands out free passes.

What dip? There was no dip. It was a fucking low plateau for a year! If you didn't buy then, you will never buy.

Yeah, it's gonna work *if* you are willing to hide your assets from the government for the rest of your life and never get a job that pays salary legally. But I suppose most people are not ready for that.

How did you get this info? From the ATM?
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:55:49
To prevent losing the 30%?
@_date: 2018-11-30 23:02:19
20% premium is not so bad for an airport.
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:19:33
~~That's so wrong. Let's calculate the expected value when we think there's a 98% chance it will drop to zero and a 2% chance to increase 50-fold. (N = initial investment)~~
~~.02×50×N - .98×N = .02×N~~
~~Therefore, **the expected value is to lose 98% of the initial investment**. Let that sink in.~~
~~Obviously, there are more possible outcomes than just 0x or 50x, but I constructed the example just to demonstrate how wrong the original statement is.~~
Edit: I don't know how to calculate expected value.
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:55:09
No one was selling for $40k. They were selling for $20k and the broker took a 100% premium. Thus the buyer paying $40k.

I'm not really sure what this post contributes to this sub. Regardless, I think you made a wise decision.

Even if it doesn't become a widely accepted payment method? What are you gonna do with it then?

How much bitcoin does Putin have?
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:31:21
I hate when people ask me about bitcoin investing. I usually try to say something really vague like "no one knows what's going to happen".
@_date: 2018-11-28 23:41:08
Know some institutional investors from Wall Street who want to invest in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:00:27
Just curious, why would you sell when it was at like 12-month low? Haven't you heard of buy low, sell high?
@_date: 2019-01-05 11:11:32
A statement can be true *and* misleading.
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:03:24
How do you know for sure that the ATM took 5% and not, say, 10%?
@_date: 2019-09-16 09:18:51


It's not a matter of perspective. By any reasonable metric (number of downloads, amount of data, amount of time...) downloading GoT is not the main purpose of the internet.
@_date: 2019-09-09 09:53:32
That's a poor analogy. Silk road's *main purpose* was to serve as a platform for criminal activity. You can't make the same claim for iPhone.
@_date: 2019-09-11 07:23:08
On a global scale he is a very unknown person and in my opinion him promoting bitcoin does not warrant saying "we made it".
@_date: 2019-05-27 09:34:59
Is that a fetish or something? I wouldn't wanna watch anything of that sort.
@_date: 2019-05-22 10:11:54
If someone accidentally deposits money on your account and you use it, it's a crime. *It's illegal to spend money that isn't yours.* Whether you stole it, stumbled on it, or it was deposited on your account is not relevant.
I would assume the same applies to any property, including bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-24 07:07:31


No, it's not. Your statement is simply false. If your neighbor accidentally parks their car on your yard do you think you suddenly own the car?


You are not responsible. You just can't use money that isn't yours. It's quite simple.
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:54:19
This guy is a total idiot. He would have lost his money sooner or later. Never invest more than you can afford to lose.

Technically, they don't need to lie. They don't need to say anything. They just need to watch the prosecutor not having enough evidence.

Wait for a new ATH
@_date: 2018-12-21 18:45:44
Did you even look at the chart? Why are you doing 18+18?
@_date: 2018-12-21 09:50:14
What's the point of this? Are you suggesting that the price always starts going up 18 months before the halving? Why?
@_date: 2019-05-27 09:42:47
What's the website? I need this for research purposes.
@_date: 2018-12-21 09:55:22
Yes. Previous halving was in 2016 and the next one in 2020.
@_date: 2018-12-21 09:52:17
If there's no prediction why did they post this chart then? They could have just said that the next halving is 18 months away.
@_date: 2018-12-21 22:33:01
Why is the chart highlighting the periods *before* halving then?
@_date: 2019-05-27 09:41:21
Nah, they prefer a coat hanger.

10,000BTC is 0.05% of all possible bitcoins. 0.05% of any currency is a lot to spend on pizza.

It's over one third of the daily energy intake. That's quite a snack.

I have owned bitcoin for years and I have no idea what this means.
Do I need to create a new wallet or what? My current bitcoin wallet address starts with 1.
