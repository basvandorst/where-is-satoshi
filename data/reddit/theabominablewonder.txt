There's this guy that reviews microcap cryptocurrencies and holds some of them. Interestingly he had EMC2 as his favourite coin which subsequently pumped quite hard (went to a $500m market cap)

Who knows what happened to those bitcoin. I bet the person who was sent them, then bought a car for 10k BTC, and is salty, and the person after that bought a flat, and is salty. Even the person who bought a nice 4 bedroom villa in the South of France for 10k BTC is salty.

The problem with crypto payments though, are the on/off ramps for the consumer and the merchant. Consumer has to buy bitcoin - fee charged. Consumer pays merchant - no charge. Merchant converts back to 'normal' currency - fee charged. The two fees between consumer and merchant are probably a couple of % anyway. So offering a discount is a bit of a zero sum game unless the merchant is willing to make a slightly greater loss to encourage crypto adoption. Of course, if third party suppliers are also willing to use crypto and adoption is normalised/mainstream then the fees will be lower and everyone will work out the way to buy crypto the most cost effective way possible.

Rich people already hoard their money. They get it into high growth assets unavailable to others. In effect they already have deflationary effects. The man on the street with few assets has to spend most of their money and don't get the opportunity to hoard it into deflationary assets. Instead they get poorer via inflation.

Wow, its like the UK but the UK is 50 years ahead and still holding on to its glorious historical status as an empire. This shit doesn't get any easier. A new generation of dinosaurs will appear in America who will cling to its past glories too.
