if both stocks and cryptos constitute capital gains/losses on realization... how in the world does the IRS rationalize not allowing it to work both ways??
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:56:28
not trying to avoid taxes... just trying to be smart about them.  
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:49:27
can you clarify what you mean by ‘opposite is not true’?
@_date: 2018-10-15 16:50:29
there is a new narrative now: STORE of VALUE.  bitcoin core is not interested in having people buy coffee with their bitcoin... why do you think they are so adamant about not solving the problems with block size etc??
@_date: 2018-10-15 10:37:48
so by your estimation, BTC has gone from mere cents to $6.5k because of what...?
@_date: 2019-03-09 16:30:48
please tell me you didn’t sell at the lows to buy this!
@_date: 2018-10-30 12:24:36
hahaa so true
@_date: 2019-10-27 11:02:39
hahaaaaaa, luv this!

is this something that can be overcome with a VPN/Opera browser??

wall street simply wants to control bitcoin.  long or short they don’t care.  once in control, they profit either direction.  only way to do that is to screw over retail.   sad but i’ve seen it over and over again.
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:39:19
the problem is there is every reason for wall street/big banks to try and CONTROL BTC and not let it get out of hand.  destroying BTC is not feasible at this point but manipulating it is.  remember, if BTC truly succeeds it will be at the expense of the banksters on wall street controlling EVERYTHING right now.  main street/retail guys will get crushed.  big money always gets bigger.  i wholeheartedly agree with OP’s sentiments.

i’m afraid we may not be looking at just noobs but also sophisticated institution/hedge funds as well.  not a good thing in my opinion as they can basically control the market at will given how tiny bitcoin/crypto is.  consider this: 150-200B is 1/3rd the size of Microsoft!
@_date: 2017-11-21 10:58:10
i see that now.  actual date not so important... it’s sounds like it is coming whether it’s dec 11 or the following month.  i would simply like to discuss the implications.
the conspiracy theorist in me thinks there will be an orchestrated crash in price so the wall street institutions can buy up futures and control the price.  please keep in mind, bitcoin at 135$ B is tiny valuation and easily manipulated.
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:39:33
i would argue since the space is so small... the influence/effect by these hedge funds are amplified 
@_date: 2018-03-31 12:31:58
 
i disagree.  a leading market strategist tom lee (fundstrat) cited an interesting metric.  according to his data: most of bitcoin’s biggest gains in any given year since inception are concentrated to only a few days.  good luck doing DCA in a parabolic bull run...
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:36:43
indeed we are of the same mindset.  GLTU

you wouldn’t be here if you thought bitcoin is a losing proposition.  it’s dipped numerous times in its history and always come back stronger than before.  nothings changed, fundamentals have never been better.  if someone bought at 15k why not buy some at 7k to average down cost basis.  sure, save some powder for 5k if it gets there.  calling a bottom is fools errand.  
now if you tell me BTC is done and going to zero then why haven’t you sold?  why waste your time on this subreddit?? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:33:56
bro, you haven’t married ur gf yet??
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:21:24
this has nothing to do with the IRS, this bill is for state/local taxes...
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:37:31
this kid is annoying, no denying that... BUT he is spot on about all the bankster!

@_date: 2019-05-12 15:06:58
tell the monkey to chill... sell ‘some’ of the trading stash ONLY
@_date: 2019-05-12 14:30:44
Same here man.  HOWEVER, it’s usually a good indication to start selling some...
@_date: 2019-05-17 09:50:54
BTC with samourai wallet is already king of dark web... monero who??
@_date: 2019-05-13 11:17:18
all the math gets thrown out the window WHEN (not if) we get an ETF
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:15:13
perhaps... that’s why you need BOTH sides covered.  monkeys are volatile and unpredictable
