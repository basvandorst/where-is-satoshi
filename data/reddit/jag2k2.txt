Those extortionists are very polite and professional.

I'm sorry but I lost much of my respect for Schiff when he interviewed Erik Vorhees.  Its not just because he is a Bitcoin skeptic but because he showed a lack of understanding of basic financial concepts.  
For instance Peter kept insisting that Bitcoin was a ponzi scheme to the point where it became obvious that he doesn't know what a ponzi scheme is.  He was saying it was a ponzi scheme because people who bought in early made lots of money and you can't do that now.
That is also called an investment.  A ponzi scheme is a confidence scam where the "payouts" to the investors are actually just investments from new investors.  Nothing of real world value is being produced, new investments are being represented as returns for other members.  Obviously this falls apart when you can't recruit new members fast enough to make "returns" for your existing investors.
I would expect normal people to make this mistake but a self proclaimed economist and expert?  It was a sad day because I really like his position and explanations on other subjects.

This would make sense though.  "Blockchain" sounds like a technology and people love technology.  "Bitcoin" sounds like money and money sounds political.
@_date: 2015-05-05 18:22:09
yay Bitcoin is awesome

Actually lets forget about Bitcoin for a moment.  In ANY market you can ask the question "hey guys whats a good trading strategy".  Unfortunately the way markets work is that if enough people have a common strategy then the market will adjust and the strategy no longer works.
For instance if you discover a pattern in which an asset dips 50% on a Tuesday then you can capitalize on that by selling on Monday being ready to buy on Tuesday.  But if word gets out then everyone is going to try and do that and guess what, your pattern behavior is gone.
People with really good strategies aren't going to go around telling others about it.  The best thing you can do is continue saving in bitcoin and doing things in the real world which increase its usefulness (therefore value).

I feel like those guys were honest and legit.  I just could never get behind that project with a name like "buttercoin".

My favorite is "you shouldn't use dollars to buy bitcoins because bitcoin is a ponzi scheme"
@_date: 2013-10-21 20:20:34
Talking about wealth in terms of "dollars" is kind of strange.  What if in 10 years there is so much inflation that a hamburger costs 1,000 dollars?  Then will a 100,000 dollar bitcoin be all that valuable?

Mining does require specialized hardware but the article is saying that the specialized hardware is also centralizing.
Not centralizing in a political sense but in a PHYSICAL sense.  Huge portions of the network power are centralizing in a few physical locations.  This makes huge portions of the network vulnerable to risks which are political, natural, and resource based.
The opposite of this would be if specialized hardware was decentralized, ie an ASIC in each smart phone, an ASIC in each water heater, an ASIC in everyone's car etc.

I also just bought a few shares.  If you own the shares for less than a week should I expect my dividends to be pro-rated or anything like that?

What do you guys think about this statement:


@_date: 2013-05-31 22:08:12
I like "mbit" and "youbit".  They roll off the tongue easier.
@_date: 2013-08-20 05:34:13
Well I don't think even most bitcoin enthusiasts (like me) would say that was really smart.  But then again what is a smart investment nowadays?
Stocks - Artificially inflated and disconnected from fundamentals.  Major correction likely.
Bonds - Wouldn't touch with a 10 foot pole.
Real Estate - I like real estate but it takes management and maintenance and taxes and we are probably in another bubble here as well.
Precious Metals - Has history on its side but is target of confiscation and has issues with liquidity and storage.
US Dollar - LMAO

There really is nothing to seize except your passwords (private keys).
Bitcoins don't exist in an account or on your computer.  Bitcoins exist on a decentralized ledger and your private keys give you permission to move around money on that ledger.  No authority can coerce or subvert the ledger without dominating the entire bitcoin network.
Bitcoins are as safe as your passwords.  Keep them secret.  Keep them safe : )

Microtransactions.  Bitcoin needs a way to work quickly at food trucks, coffee shops, and vending machines.

Seriously you don't need to meet anyone in person.  I got interested in bitcoin about the same time as you and being 32 WITH a bank account in the US I hit the same frustrations and walls.
I purchased several thousand worth of bitcoin through bitinstant and mtgox.  Its the way to go thought the fee sucks.

But I already have a job where I'm employed for us dollars.  I also have a wife and kids so I don't really want to quit or take on a second job.  I really like bitcoin though and want to own some.  Do I have your permission to use an exchange considering my special circumstance?
@_date: 2013-12-31 15:01:36
Have you heard of Charles Hoskinson and the Bitcoin Education Project?  Maybe you guys should work together.
@_date: 2013-07-18 15:11:43
Good maybe they will leave us alone then.
Also I find it interesting that they use the language virtual currency "schemes".  Nice.

Bitcoin or no Bitcoin this is a great reason why privacy is so important.  Many have the attitude of "I don't need tons of privacy because I have nothing to hide."  That is well intentioned but the reality is you can't keep track of all the laws that are out there so you may be breaking a ridiculous law unknowingly.  At any time the government laws can change as well and they may come down on you to make an example out of you.
Lack of privacy earned this family a federal prosecution.

I have always had this question about bitcoin.  If Romney had complied with his demands and sent 1M worth of bitcoin to a particular address then that address would be constantly watched from that day forward right?  How could those coins be spent except in face to face transactions?
If he bought something on the internet he'd have to provide a shipping address.  Seems like bitcoin wouldn't be the best currency to use when attempting a high profile extortion.

That is great congrats.  Now make a watch whose face has the Bitcoin logo.

Which unbiased senator would you recommend to replace him?  
We need someone who is not affected by a competitor to the Federal Reserve and who does not have a stake in the US dollar.

How is this possible?  I understand BFL funded the large upfont cost of their gen I design with pre-orders.
Few people are going to pre-order from these guys again and I highly doubt their first round was profitable enough to fund this upgrade.

I have been to Lima a few times and seen this personally.  I asked my guide why there was such a long line at the bank and he replied that they were "paying their monthly bills".
In Lima many residents don't have access to internet or a reliable mail service.  I think this is the result.  Also in Lima more than 1/3 population lives in horrible poverty.  I don't think they stand in lines at banks though.
