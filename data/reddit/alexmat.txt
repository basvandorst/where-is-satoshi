Just FYI, before you run off making the video, the official p2pool site is:  
You can verify it's also listed on the wiki page: 
p2pool.org is just someones p2pool node and they are raking in 2%. Plenty of free nodes exist which are much better and have nicer UIs:

Good job picking a starting date to prop up your strawman. You'll have a bright future as a FED chairman!

Could we just add flair to the titles like "meme" and "news" so it's easy to skim the headlines quicker? r/joinmarket does a nice job of this.

"How is it associated with Bitcoin?"
It uses a similar proof of work and p2p model to create a distributed trust-less messaging system. 
"Is my BTC addresss a BitMessage address?"
No, this project is not directly related to bitcoin, but they share similar goals (anonymous decentralized collaboration). Bitcoin is geared towards financial transactions, bitmessage is geared towards communication.
"Who is using such a system? Is anyone besides testers/devs using it yet?"
Nobody, this is a very early preview for devs who are interested and anybody familiar with crypto analysis. It is not for mainstream consumption and in fact is currently not secure due to the crypto libraries being used. See more here: 
"How would I send a message and ensure someone else could read it?"
Visit the subreddit or bitmessage.org to download the software. The interface is pretty straight forward. Details about how things operate under the hood can be found in the whitepaper.
"Assume I need to meet Snakes with the Stuff... Does it inter-operate at all with existing E-mail?"
No, this is a standalone p2p system that does not require a server, nor does it inter-operate with existing mail systems.
"Can I send or receive these on a phone? Gotta meet snakes with the stuff"
Not yet, but if we get enough dev interest, there is no reason a mobile client cannot be written.
Apologies for the barebones nature of the support. There is currently one dev and I'm just doing pr/spreading the word to get more eyeballs on the protocol. I think this could be a crucial tool in the fight for our privacy. Any and all help is welcome. There is a lot of work to do before this is ready for even savvy users.
More questions and discussion are encouraged, but please keep in mind this is alpha level stuff with no support.

The gist is that it is an anonymous p2p email system. Here is a very short and accessible whitepaper on it. 
@_date: 2012-12-27 00:42:30
"Bitmessage is a P2P communications protocol used to send encrypted messages to another person or to many subscribers. It is decentralized and trustless, meaning that you need-not inherently trust any entities like root certificate authorities. It also aims to hide "non-content" data, like the sender and receiver of messages, from eavesdroppers."

There's a developing market for this problem:

Not if you offer more than listing price. Get creative and save money on the back end by negotiating good terms.
If you depend on the bank for financing, don't complain when you have to follow their rules.

This guy did not do his research before buying a house with bank money: 
Pull the bankers dick out of your mouth and find a house with seller financing.

Haha, I wish the attorney general was that bad ass. The whole fiasco played out more like this:

This is a case of fraud, which is a criminal matter. 
Hashking claimed to be operating two separate investment accounts, one was PPT(pirate pass through) and the other was a deposit account for investing in mining equipment "guaranteed and backed by him personally". His excuse that "pirate defaulting on the PPT accounts" allows him to expunge all of his debt obligations (including his non pirate accounts) is fraud and no longer a civil matter in my opinion.

The [videos you've put up]( so far are great! My Ukrainian is pretty rusty, but everyone seems very determined to make this work. It might help if you can add English subtitles to them or at least a little context in the descriptions.

Tony and his friend John die in a car accident and go to judgment. God tells Tony that because he cheated on his income taxes, the only way he can enter Heaven is to sleep with a stupid, ugly woman for the next five years.
A few days later, as Tony's walking in the park with his stupid, hideous new girlfriend, he spots his friend John with an absolutely drop dead gorgeous woman. "John, what happened?" Tony asks.
"I have no idea," John replies. "I was told I have five years of amazing sex to look forward to. The only thing I don't understand is why she always yells 'Damn income taxes!' whenever we have sex."
