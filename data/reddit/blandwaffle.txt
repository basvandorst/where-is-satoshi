Also you don't really own the keys

Could the same be said for Litecoin if you paid in LC?
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:00:16
I vote this one!
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:11:29
This hurts me. (Especially with the recent activity of Litecoin)
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:06:22
Damn...I like this question.. probably 100k of BTC, Eth, and Litecoin..maybe a few other alt coins.
But to be honest I would more likely invest in creating a mining farm. Buy a fuckton of antminer L3+ and T9s, cooling materials and equipment.  ��

Like GDAX? Or bitfinix? 
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:19:04
Same. You will always kick your past self for not jumping in. Remember there is plenty of time for bitcoin to grow.

Until the government gets involved..which they are trying to do now.. slow process but I'm worried about the future of crypto currency. The federal reserve will not let this go unchecked..

That is interesting indeed... Well I will let you know what happens in January then.. (miner should be delivered by then)

So far so good. Their receipt for purchasing their miner seems legit. And their customer service is still top tier with fast responses. Heck even when I was a dumb ass and being rude (though it's  my fault for not seeing the email) about small error they replied back with politeness.
Here are the emails
"Also one (last thing I promise...hopefully)
I've have already ordered and it looks really promising..but one mistake.. Google has done the auto fill for my address section, and I see on the "Company Name" section it threw in my birth date... 
I hope you or somebody in the help desk could fix that and make it blank please. 
Thanks again!"
Theirs: "Thank you for your order.
I will make the change, I see the problem. I will remove the 198 from the address field.
Please let me know if there is anything else you need.
(When I didn't see their email here's my stupid response ):
"OK...This is getting ridiculous... anyone there? "
Then they replied:
"Hello X,
Have I missed your enquiry?
Best regards,
Clive. "
Had to apologize:
"I'm terribly sorry I didn't see your help desk replied back to my earlier message from last week. Please forgive me.
Nothing is needed. Again terribly sorry for my rudeness. ��"
"Hello X,
haha, you had me checking through history to see if there was something I had missed! :)
Apology accepted and no problem."
So far they seem to be real..a faker wouldn't go this far...I hope lol

Thinking of doing it (especially since bitcoin has risen quite a bit I have a few extra coins ��)
I will once again quote email or receipt if I get any new information from them.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:55:21
Haha thanks! I really appreciate it!
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:04:43
I totally understand. We need someone else to take on Bitmain but it's always risky sending bitcoin to a company that is brand new.. if it helps here was my first response from them regarding to my first wave of questions..
"Thank you for your interest in our products.
We cannot accept paypal for 2 reasons.
1) They are expensive and love to close accounts related to bitcoin products and services
2) Accepting this payment method would not support the cryptocurrency network which is what we are all invested in. It's important we use the currencies that we are investing in. If we do not support it as merchants and customers, what hope do we have that it will gain widespread acceptance in the future?
3) We are having to keep lots of information back to safeguard our product designs and configuration otherwise our competitors will get access and we will lose our competitive edge. If you want to read other bits, that are not published on the site please see a recent interview we did:
4) Once batch 1 of our miners are shipped, we have offered a number of customers a 10% discount in return for them carrying out video reviews of our product. At this point, we expect the monopoly that our competitor has will begin to shift. If you have any doubts about us, simply wait until batch 1 has been shipped and you are able to see the reviews posted by our customers before ordering yourself for future batches.
Please let me know if you have any further questions.
Best regards, "

I'm currently talking with them as well. They had a well written reply back to me about who they are...but they still won't tell me the details about their machine (like damn it I want to know how loud it is compared to the antminers)..but now I'm waiting for another response from them...but I'm always open and hoping for more competition in the miner department. Bitmain has a monopoly (or at least it seems like it)
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:26:13
Alright so here's my response from them. Note I had to trim some of the email (personal info lol)
"Warranty: This is for 5 years and covers boards, chips and PSU. In the unlikely event that you have any issues, simply return the unit and we will replace with new at no extra cost (including shipping). Warranty is activated by the return of the unit.
Noise: The noise the unit generates will be dependant on the ambient operating temp which will vary from customer to customer. The fan will only work as hard as it needs to in order to expel the warm air left over from the liquid cooling. In normal ambient temp of around 25-30c, the unit will be around 50-55dba, with that rising up as high as 70dba if the ambient temp is 35-40c.
Please let me know if you have any further questions. Thank you "
