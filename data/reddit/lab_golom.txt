well said, but you forgot to mention pure scams like tether and market manipulation by whales, otherwise great points.   
@_date: 2018-08-28 16:32:13
everything you have said here is all just wishful thinking, everything.  BTC IS tulip mania 2.0 based on the actual price charts, but not based on wishful thinking.  
You say "investing is creating value" but the fact is you are actually losing value over time, unless you cherry pick the time frame.  "As a store of value and transaction method it very much creates value for people"  which people?  Most have lost, that is a fact.  
Look up tether, and the scam that is their promise of "we have real dollars for every tether," which is utter nonsense.   
Just look at a chart of the all time prices to verify everything I am saying.  Nothing I am saying is based on wishful thinking, only facts.

I didn't lose a penny.  I researched all of this in 2017.  I came to the proper conclusion that BTC was being manipulated, exchanges were stealing value from investors, and tether was "printing money" that was used to inflate BTC to stupid levels.

Example:  if you invest in me you may make millions, or not.  I didn't really say anything useful.

OK, I'll use my head, thanks for the tip.  
Now perhaps you could do the same?  you literally said, it's not about the money, then said, you are sad about the money.  One of us is making statements that are contradictory, can you guess which? (pro tip-use your head).  
You can say you care about the tech, and the profit, and that is fine.  But if you say you do not care about the profit, and only the tech, what is the problem, it will moon soon. 
You are literally saying that you believe in it as a currency,and if you were to use it as such, you would be screwed.  That would seem to make the point that the tech is not working as intended.
So that is a fair point, but not if you are a tech "believer."  So which is it?  you want the tech to work, AND you want the money part to work.  Both have failed, yet you say "we honestly want to use crypto as currency. We believe in it long term and want to be a part of it."  If that is actually true, then sit on your stacks and quit complaining about price. 
So you want to cherry pick your outcome with an entirely new technology and claim not to care about the money, except you do care about the money.  How did I do?  (I used my head).

OK hotshot, time will reveal the truth, you can not argue with that.  I am saying that tether will be the death of bitcoin as we know it, and also that the Russians helped trump gain the presidency.

yeah, that first part is so true.  The part of "everything moves in cycles" is not true.  Many things move in bubbles, like tulip futures, beanie babies, and cabbage patch kids.  Therefore not everything goes up and down and up.  Sometimes things move up, up, up, then down forever.

The statement:  "As long as a significant number of merchants/service providers don't accept bitcoin and prices in crypto are not reasonably stable, there will never be a mass adoption of crypto." is correct, but it is not up to merchants to solve your money problem.  In a free market they need to make profit, and are simply not in business to make your business/idea/disruption better.    
@_date: 2018-06-06 20:34:38
what makes you think I am a liberal?  Is it liberal to see the facts in front of your face?  Or is it that the propoganda machine that was created by Roger ails has taught yo that anyone that thinks anything other than the fox news propaganda is a "far-left fanatic."  
history lesson here:  that is what Nazi's did in 1937. 
 
And if you think that the Russian have not spied on America you are the one that is brainwashed.  If you think Putin would not be happy to see us fall, you just do not understand the big picture of the world order.  
I have researched, and I found the offices where the Russian government has rooms full of cyber warriors that target democracies globally.  You see I have been in the world, my friend, and I have actually seen things that would make you crawl up into a little weeping ball.  
I was in the US Army Information Systems Command.  We fought an information war with the Russians that did not end with the Cold War, and the fall of the Berlin wall.
Have you ever been to the USSR, because I have, and guess what?  I HAVE done my homework on the Russians, and I love the people.  I hate the government, they are under a new Czar.

@_date: 2018-06-22 22:09:09
yes, yes I do.  Why?  because they did not perform an audit.  What part of that do you not understand?
Hers a clue:  audits are performed by accountants.  This was a statement by a law firm that said on this day, at this time, there was x amount in these accounts.  This is less than meaningless.  Look up what an audit is, then you will understand better.    
@_date: 2018-06-21 18:07:20
I know more than the average person, but you can't possibly know what I do know.  
I am making a nuanced point, it is OK if you don't understand it, it is a very esoteric point.  My point being that all crypto, indeed all money came from a thought.  At the very beginning someone had to say "this shell is worth that deer." Then gold, paper money, then ethereal money...I have studied finance, and do know quite a lot about financial markets, the creation of money itself, and history, but sure, you know me better than my dissertation committee.       
Do you disagree that BTC is made from brainpower and technology? Do you think it is made of tubes?  
@_date: 2018-06-21 02:44:23
No, that is not how the real world works, that only works with people who can not face reality, or the possibility that this is actually all a huge scam.  The FUD remains because they will not do an actual audit.  
Saying a banana is an apple may make you feel good, but it is not rue, and never was true.  
@_date: 2018-06-21 17:58:44
So it is made of copper?  tin?  wood?  paper?  nope, it is made from brain power, and technology.  But the material itself is ethereal, hence etherium...do try to keep up.  
@_date: 2018-06-05 20:24:08
That is actually a great idea that actually could help with adoption.
@_date: 2018-06-24 20:24:16
Ponzis cannot grow indefinitely they will always collapse, leaving the last round of participants penniless- this is correct, now do try to follow me here.
Nobody is secretly paying Peter with Paul's money- except tether 
There is no promise of returns through a secret mechanism- except with tether
There is no fraudulent accounting taking place- except tether literally just did this.
Bitcoins are intrinsically unsustainable because they are built on fraudulent accounting (tether ponzi) that is covered up by constant growth (false bubble, again because tether)
So you are right, bitcoin is in a huge bubble, that is CAUSED by the TETHER PONZI SCHEME.  Thanks for that!  You literally made my point.  
And what you have "shown here" is that YOU are indeed, the one whom is confused by the terms ponzi and bubble.  You understand the definition, but are unable or unwilling to go to the next step and actually apply that knowledge to the real world.  That's OK, it can get complicated.  I hope what I have taught you today helps someone out there.

@_date: 2018-06-24 03:20:45
A Ponzi scheme is where you take people's money, based on the promise of some great returns, but offer no real value, or had no product to begin with.  Then you use the money from the new investors to pay off the older investors.  Like tether.  
A bubble is like the Dutch tulip Mania, or The Housing Bubble, or Bitcoin's price.  
The reason it is relevant is that some people may be using a ponzi scheme to perpetuate a bubble.  And there are more layers but these were the ones that are relevant.

get real?  really?  are you seriously advocating that merchants need to change their operations, banking, and overall business model to conform (like a Ukrainian gymnast) to a terrible payment system?  
Why would they do that, do they owe you a new currency?  Is it now up to them to make your Frankenstein of a currency work?  That is like asking the townspeople to adapt to the monster!

discussing ponzi schemes belongs in the BTC thread because much of it IS a ponzi scheme.  That would be the Nazi part-the part that people do not want to hear any dissension, and best toe the party line (BTC to the moon).  So sorry you have failed to grasp that.     
@_date: 2018-06-21 02:41:08

yes, just look at the all time price chart.  Then compare that with any bubble asset, like tulips, and you will see they are they same.  It does not do what it was meant to do because the very lack of regulation that drew people to it made them subject to human greed.  With no one watching, millions lost millions of real dollars.  You can think what you want, but this was an obvious bubble, and I was looking seriously at it in July of 2017.  I could have turned 2500 into 20,000.  But I didn't.  
I also could have turned that 2500 into nothing, because either the exchange froze up transactions, or simply took my coins.  But I didn't.  Because I did my research.  Good luck.

Bitcoin is very much like MLM, in that new investors must buy it to drive up the price.  If no one buys it anymore, then the price goes down, so it is very much like a MLM scam in that regard.  Before you react, I did not say BTC IS a scam.  I said the price reacts to the hype, much like MLM.

If BTC is a store of value, then it has failed already, for anyone investing this year.  If you have to cherry pick the timeframe, then the store of value statement becomes meaningless.  
It fails no matter when you bought, if you consider all who lost due to exchanges freezing assets, and outright theft, or so called hacks.  
It is not stable, trusted, safe, or easy to use for the average person.  Markets are regulated for one very good reason:  human greed.  Ignore that at your peril.

When you buy stock, you buy shares, but even if you own 75% of the shares that does not mean that you own 75% of the assets.

Pretty sure we covered that in ECON, yep, we did, and I do remember what inflation is. . .  
Bitcoin fees are so high that they (read the words) ACT LIKE hyper-inflation.  
Is that better, or easier to understand?  Do you disagree that the high transaction fees of using BTC make the total amount you get or send lower? 
maybe I am not saying this clearly.  Isn't that similar to the effect of inflation on a currency-you must give more to get the same thing after high inflation.

If someone's grandfather was a Nazi, and he is a Neo-Nazi would you also say that is unrelated?
Can you please explain why you would dismiss such an occurrence? 
 
Do you believe that a persons' family tree has no bearing on their beliefs?  Can you justify that belief with any science? 
When people think in binary terms it can get in the way of real understanding.  
Saying that is 100% right/wrong, or factor x has no bearing/factor x is entirely responsible are great examples of logical fallacies with regards to human behavior.  
The nature/nurture debate itself is based upon a flawed binary premise that one or the other is correct, because there are multiple reasons for any person's beliefs, morals, and/or lack thereof.

I actually think you need to have this discussion in a VFW Hall.  There is one in most towns.  Please go in, have a beer, and ask everyone there if their "interests were aligned with American interests."

Do you think that all of our classified documents should be open and available to the world?  If so, how many assets are you willing to sacrifice at the altar of freedom of information?  100?  1000?  10,000? 1,000,000?  A war could roast millions instantly.  
I do not blindly support all that our government does, but as long as we do have a democracy, we must have the rule of law, especially when it is not convenient.  
I am in the terrible position of having to agree with you, but with the caveat that no classified documents can be leaked, unless the reason (crime) was run up the chain of command, and then, if they refuse to change, and are acting in a criminal manner (gulags) then by all means, let the light of the truth shine.

The DNC emails were not classified, because they are not a governmental agency.  But if someone hacked your personal info, including all of your private emails, banking information, sexual preferences, and everything else, would that be OK with you?  
Watergate was a burglary of the democratic party offices.  Trump asked Russia to hack into \(burglarize electronically\) the private emails of US citizens, who were conducting political business.  
Whether or not they were doing anything illegal is a moot point, the point is that US citizens have a right to privacy\-

Are you still talking about Julian Assange?  The one who leaked classified documents?  That alone is criminal, and punishable under the Espionage Act, and that punishment can include death, but no, it is not treason.   
Publishing a story is not treason, leaking classified documents is criminal, and anti\-American \(or whichever state is compromised\).  Doing the wrong thing for the right reason is still doing the wrong thing.  Both Clinton and trump are suspected of doing the wrong thing.  Whatever you may think, there are laws for a reason, and most things are not treason.  Bernie Sanders was my choice, BTW, and I support him financially.  
I also took an oath, to defend the Constitution, and I will do that every chance I get.  I had a Top Secret clearance, and never even considered "leaking" any information.

and YOU are making claims that tether is not A CONSPIRACY AND A SCAM.

fair enough.  I have been reading a lot about the space, and am weary of some of the logic, but what you say actually makes sense, wish you well.

exactly, average conversation around this:
Skeptic: What proof do you have?
Conspiracy Idiot: Why don't they just have an Audit?
Skeptic: So you don't have proof?
Conspiracy Idiot: Do you have proof it isn't a vast conspiracy?
Skeptic: :eyeroll;

no audit=no proof. Really that is not hard to understand, is it?

swing and a miss, bud.
You claim that tether is safe. I point out that they are proven liars, and they refuse to be audited, both things can be easily proven.
But your claim that they are solvent is unfounded. An audit would prove the truth, but their refusal, again after already saying that they would do an audit, proves that they CAN'T withstand an audit, and that they lied.
This is not a logical fallacy. Nice try though, I give you credit for googling...maybe you should enroll in a logic course, or at least study logic online. I enjoyed my logic classes and philosophy studies at university.

no I didn't. fail. Please quote me. I made no claims at all. That is the entire point....everyone else is making unsubstantiated claims of a vast tether conspiracy.

Bernie Madoff was pretty popular too, for a while.  
@_date: 2018-12-18 21:50:37
yes, do not believe the facts in front of your eyes, they lie.  
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:33:04
You claim that tether is OK.  You are not the president, you do not get to say one thing yesterday, and take the exact opposite position today.  Your words are there for all to see.  
I get it everyone else is to blame.  go away now.
@_date: 2018-12-20 15:53:03
so you do not think that you made a claim.
You basically were agreeing with someone that said that "conspiracy theorists have no proof"  inferrence is a thing, look it up.

It will never die.  Like anything else, there will always be new rubes to lose money to the whales.  
The only thing propping this up is stupidity, tether, and whales with millions of dollars to help prop up the inevitable decline.  
I have been saying this since July of 2017.
