10% Tax on every transaction if they somehow legally could, hope not though.

This did indeed give me hope. Thanks for the positive comment and information.

Well I remember hearing about it around 2012 for the first time, thinking "man I really wish I was more computer literate and new how to build a mining machine." Unfortunately at that time I wouldn't be able to assemble any type of mining machine because I was just getting by paying bills and living on frozen pizza. So I never made an effort to educate myself on the subject then.
The next time I hear about Bitcoin the price has gone up to around the price of gold per ounce (2015 I beleive). I'm even more envious for those who have been mining blocks for years. It's 2017 now and I'm finally getting into it. As I am learning more about it now thinking in my head I should have jumped on the damn train sooner. 
If only I would have listened to Big Smoke back then, "All you had to do was follow the damn train CJ!"

These are really nice works of art. I'd buy them as a wallet but since I do not know how secure it would be I am hesitant.

Thank you for the information, it is greatly appreciated and I will definitely give it a shot. I see your point and for $200, that's no problem at all. I probably spend that much eating at Chipotle in a couple months time lol. But seriously I will thanks again mate.

I asked one person at work if he knew about bitcoin or crypto-currencies, he had no idea.

Congrats mate, you have made nearly 10 X your money and possibly more. I wish I was into BTC at that time. You paid attention to it, trusted in it, and that paid off. Personally hope it goes down a bit before it goes up anymore and stays up. But otherwise good job.

Thanks for the insight.

Please provide evidence to support your claim

I have just got Interested and am considering investing in Bitcoin and other crypto currency. Why is it a bad idea now? Also do you day trade it or just hold on to it?
@_date: 2017-07-26 08:51:57
As someone who is interested in how to get going on investing or mining bitcoins this makes me sad , since I already lost a lot of the potential profitability. Those who do have bitcoins, I am happy for them. They made/ are making the effort and seen the potential ahead of time. Is it worth investing in now that it seems to be possibly crashing? Are there any other trustworthy crypto currencies worth investing in long term?

Big Beautiful Coin

Doing better than me I'm just now getting into this idea of day trading and long term investing in the stuff. Don't even got the paper wallet yet lol.
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:22:24
Thanks this helped explain some

Imagine opening one up in Dubai
@_date: 2017-07-26 06:57:33
Do you think it will remain on top of the other currencies? Would it be better to hold on to long term or day trade Bitcoin? Maybe I'm asking in the wrong subreddit but I'm looking into investing in Bitcoin and some of the other names out there.
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:16:33
So you can invest in less than one full coin at a time?

Awesome to hear. I too personally enjoy investing in bullion. And a great idea. Unfortunately I'm a poor person so I invest in silver (poor man's gold) and copper. I admire the way it looks stacked or not.
