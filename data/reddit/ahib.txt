I'd rather lose a little, than kick myself later for missing out on a lot. Just don't risk what you can't afford to lose. Any amount not spent is slowly lost through inflation and life events anyway.

I'm just enjoying the ride. I invested with the same mindset, that it could be lost. Can't wait to see what happens next, and how it adapts/evolves. To me it feels like an exciting experiment, for science.

you should make a post on r/forhire too

when volatile things move up/down fast (went from 4 to 8 pretty quick), they tend to over shoot before stabilizing

hilarious, at first I thought people were really discussing something called Cosby Coins

 does work, and should have more inventory soon, if you are actually willing to send cash through the mail

can't the bitcoin community look into seeing exactly where those bitcoins went and who they rightfully belong to?

I've heard 'Amazon Payments' and 'Google Checkout' thrown around. I don't know much about either, but a Google engineer did make a bitcoin mining tool

oh bitcoin, so much drama

haha, finally ATI gets an advantage over nVidia

I say do all three, Gold, Silver, and Bitcoins. Silver is probably the safest though, it has many uses and can have shortages.

holy, wasn't it 60cents a couple weeks ago? That's crazy
@_date: 2011-06-10 13:24:21
do the people around you talk about bitcoin the way they did about buying real estate? Is it common knowledge yet? If no, then there's still a majority who haven't discovered it.
@_date: 2011-06-10 14:18:53
Visa and Paypal both blocked me from doing what I want with my own money[true story bro]. Fuck them! They can't control how I spend Bitcoins, fucking bitches.

I keep checking bitcoinmonitor and saying WTF :O

I'm a long term holder, I buy more on dips.

A slot machine is rigged with odds against you. When you research and determine the fundamentals are sound for a potential new currency, it's a different situation.
@_date: 2011-06-10 14:14:16
I don't know, they could possibly flock to it in mass if the USD and other currencies continue down the path they're heading, know one knows the future though

I can't log in either and I know I entered everything correctly too...

If your student loans are big, I'd hold until they're worth enough to wipe out all your student loans at once. If it's going to improve your life (like killing a big debt) it's worth selling. If not, I'd save until it is, even with risk, since what you have now probably isn't going to do that much(yet) for you anyway. IMO
@_date: 2011-06-11 01:11:52
when I first heard about it, people were excited that it was on par with the USD, then it went right to 60cents

I've never been scammed, I'm not stupid
@_date: 2011-04-30 20:08:34
It's a good problem to have though, I'm going with Capital Gains myself, keeping it secret isn't worth the risk

That's a very interesting perspective

she's trying to hold you back, which is the exact opposite of what a teacher is supposed to be doing

China won't let companies sell things for bitcoins, and then Baidu had to stop accepting bitcoins, it will come back up when there is good news

Kevin I thought you sold at 300-ish?

Competition is good, they can try out promoting each other etc, it's just going to increase adoption of both
