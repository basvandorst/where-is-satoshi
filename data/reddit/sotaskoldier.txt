I just pulled the quotes from Wikipedia.  They have sources linked for the claims on his page.  Just go to [Jack Dorsey's]( wikipedia page.

Bitcoin, as far as being a currency is going to be the linux of the world.  It is going to have its evangelists as long as it is around who are screaming the whole time that it is the next big thing.  Bitcoin will never be useless.  It will always have a place and certain things in the world will grow to rely on it even.  But it will never because a major currency of the world as long as it has a pretty significant learning curve to even use it.  If I handed a 4 year old $5 and said go into that store and buy anything you want for less than $5 they would probably fuck up one thing.  They would not understand the price of things when you factor in tax.  Or maybe their concept of money is not there and they will want something that is more than $5.   If I gave a child bitcoin and told them to do the same they would be completely god damn lost for a lot longer duration of time.

That is misleading and you know it.  To say that Linux and Android are the same from a user-friendliness standpoint is just patently false.  
While *technically* Linux==Android,yes--that is very misleading though.
