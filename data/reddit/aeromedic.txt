I am pushing some local businesses to start accepting Bitcoin. I want to guide people in how to accept Bitcoins and how to keep it all secure. It seems the best way so far to introduce people is setting them up with a wallet, and throw them a few satoshi's to get started. Afterwards, I usually say, "that 10 cents I just sent you, reached every computer on the Bitcoin network. Each computer worked to ensure what I sent to you was an honest transaction. It went around the world, from me to you."   What are some other impressive lines to tell people, leave them wanting more?

It's understandable for a merchant to not want to educate every customer, it takes time to grasp it. My suggestion would be a new sticker with, a "learn more here" web address. Every customer that asks, tell them "it is just another form of payment, go to that website for more info. Now, how about a dozen donuts?" He is missing the opportunity to engage with his customers, even if it's a quick diversion to upsell some more donuts.

I will be there with my Skyhook BTC vending machine! I will also be speaking about Small Business and Bitcoin. It is going to be a fun event, also look out for the casino night! Come out and play casino games and enter to win some bitcoin! It's at the Cavalier in Virginia Beach, see you there!

You can charge more for a Cornhole board when there is a great design on it. Hook up with some local artists in your area, or set up a projector and sketch something your into, paint it with acrylics. Do an image search for Cornhole board art, there's lots of inspiration out there. Set up a Cornhole tournament in a parking lot, make some brackets and the prize is paid out in bitcoin, do it!

Andreas is a people person, he is all in for all the people. He does a great job of explaining complex ideas simply and straight forward.  He is right about not being able to "un-invent" this technology. Now I just need to convince the people in my life to sit down and listen to Andreas talk for twenty minutes. I feel the urge to share this video with as many people as possible.
