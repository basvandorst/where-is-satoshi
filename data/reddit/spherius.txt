Pools have nothing to do with that problem, though, and none of these proposals has done anything to change the fact that an actor with vast resources could easily build a big enough farm to take total control of Bitcoin (and right now, even a Bill Gates or a Warren Buffett could pull it off; it wouldn't even require a nation-state).

Have you heard anyone worrying about acid rain (in America, anyway) or the ozone hole lately? No. Why? Because of regulation. Checkmate.
Also, violent crime is down in America largely because of the reduction in environmental lead contamination. That's because we stopped allowing leaded gasoline and lead paint. It's probably hard to quantify just how much money that has saved, but its a vast sum.
And then there's seat belts and air bags, which have saved countless lives, and which had to be stuffed down the auto industry's throat (next time you buckle your seat belt, keep in mind you have Ralph Nader to thank for it).

Disagree. You're casting the regulators as the villains, but they're only the villains if you make them the villains by stonewalling and refusing to enter a dialogue. We're not drug dealers here, needing to be afraid of the man in all his guises, we're just creating a payment system. That's not by itself a problem for the establishment. Regulation, if well-crafted by an effective dialogue between stakeholders, can actually *reduce* costs like those we're seeing the market pay in such cases as Gox and NeoBee. It's obviously critical to strike the right balance so as not to have the regulations cost more than the problems they're designed to prevent, but if you refuse to take a seat at the table, you're essentially guaranteeing that such a balance will not be struck. That may further your goals to get the people all riled up against the government, but for those of us who don't share that goal, it's entirely counterproductive.
PS: No, you don't get to hold up Enron and the 2008 financial crisis as examples of failure of regulations and try to extend that into an excuse not to regulate, given that the reality is a) that the key areas were essentially entirely unregulated, b) that regulation had been consistently relaxed over a period of 30+ years on the financial industry as a whole, and c) that no one even considered new regulations to handle the kinds of problem derivatives that brought down Enron and the big banks in 2008 (and both collapses were ultimately brought on by the key concept of making an ordinary asset into a security, so the two *are* related). (Note that derivatives are still quite poorly regulated, thanks to the efforts of financial industry lobbyists to water down the Dodd-Frank bill at every chance they got, or could buy.)

1. A wallet is not the same thing as an address. A wallet is a collection of public/private keypairs. An address is a hash of a public key.
2. No, only addresses that have received funds can be found on the blockchain. An address will only become a part of the blockchain once Bitcoins are sent to it in a transaction. To track every address would be an essentially impossible task, given that there are 2^160 possible addresses.

Who said I was arguing in favor of exactly the current regulatory regime we have? I think it's very clear we need to create more tailored regulations for the Bitcoin industry specifically. If we did that, we could potentially override the current situation in which exchanges have to get licensed as money transmitters state by state. We could end up with a *more* efficient regulatory regime if things are done right.
I doubt you want competition to be so easy as to allow any random person to slap together an exchange in an afternoon, advertise for a week, wait a month until decent volume builds up, and then get hacked/run off with the money/lose the private keys/whatever. It's undeniable that this has happened numerous times in the past, to the detriment of the community and Bitcoin's overall image. Some decent regulation could really help Bitcoin's adoption rates to climb.

Looks like the network needs to scale to about 125,000 tx/block to get 12.5 BTC at 0.0001 BTC per tx. At a rate of 0.3 kB per tx, that's 37.5 MB per block, 5.4 GB per day, 162 GB per month and ~2 TB per year. Ouch.
On the other hand, if Bitcoin achieves anything like that kind of usage, we'll see a BTC price so sky-high, it won't matter that there's only a 12.5 BTC reward per block.
Eventually, I think the hope is that as the reward drops to nothing, the sheer transaction volume (along with the associated fees) makes up the difference.
PS: By the way, 125,000 tx per block is actually only ~208 tx/sec...

Hey, since you're here, can I make a quick feature request or two? I'd really appreciate having coin control in my Greenaddress wallet--I have a number of different outputs available in my wallet, and I'd like to be able to choose which to spend.
In addition, though I'm well aware, as a developer myself, that this is a tricky problem (and one which may not have a good solution), there's currently no way to prove ownership of Greenaddress funds (something just about every other client can do by simply signing a message with the appropriate address's private key). This isn't necessarily an important issue, but it may limit the ability of Greenaddress users to use any future services which require such authentication (one of which I'm currently in the process of developing).

Using a client with an HD wallet (that's a hierarchical deterministic wallet for you newbies out there, meaning that an unlimited number of addresses can be generated from a single seed, and this set of addresses will be the same on every device used) is a better solution, since you can give the master public key to the webserver and have it generate new addresses (conveniently, this can be done entirely independently of the private key generation, yet still provide addresses whose private keys will be generated by the master private key). This bit of crypto magic allows a web server to direct users to pay to the correct addresses without the webmaster having to either store the private keys on the server or transfer new sets of keys to the server every so often.

Wallets aren't connected to the blockchain. A wallet is simply a set of public/private keypairs, which can be generated at will, entirely apart from the blockchain. The blockchain only "knows" about certain keypairs by way of the addresses to which money has been sent; each address represents a unique keypair. So, you can generate keypairs offline, manually copy the representative addresses onto your online computer, and direct your Bitcoins to those addresses, at which point the blockchain then "knows" about your new keypairs.

What? The fact that lenders were able to offload risk onto other players in the market (which is abuse in its own way) enabled brokers to engage in massive abuse at the lower levels, getting people into loans they couldn't possibly afford. There was abuse alright, all the way up and down the chain (including some borrowers who were taking advantage of the situation, but they don't represent a significant portion of the market).
EDIT: Also, do you read every set of Terms of Service for everything you sign up for? Do you read the contract in full every time you borrow money?

Wow, we really are a lot alike. I was a donor to Obama's campaign starting in June 2007, but I sent a very angry email in December 2008 after that inexcusable FISA vote of his. (I voted for Rocky Anderson in 2012, and I didn't give so much as a dime the second time around. Not that it mattered...)
I can understand the cynicism you feel after the Obama betrayal, but I urge you to reconsider your stance on government. I won't try to convince you that hierarchy is somehow awesome or anything, but as you say, we're unlikely to see any truly paradigm-shifting changes in society anytime soon (although I am fairly optimistic about the political and demographic directions of this country, personally). As such, simply bowing out of participation in our "democracy," (such as it is) is just giving away what little power one does have to those who have the ability to manipulate the views of people less astute than oneself.
Realistically, the only way the government is going to improve in this country is if we can get a new party into federal office (and given American political dynamics, any party that successfully achieves federal office is likely to supplant one of the existing major parties today). The problem is, a new party has to be started and built at the local level. Occupy failed to ignite a true movement because it didn't manage to advocate any kind of coherent agenda (and incidentally, offers an example of how I see anarchist societies having trouble in certain areas; I suppose some sort of system could be built to invest power in a particular leader temporarily during a particular situation, but that didn't work out too well for Rome...)
What we need is an agenda that reaches across today's political spectrum. Tea partiers and socialists alike are still angry at the banks. Most Americans agree that we need further reform in the health care sector. A significant majority also acknowledge that humans are causing climate change. I suspect most people would also support tariffs on goods made in countries with poor environmental and labor protections, to prevent a global "race to the bottom." In addition, public opinion is turning against both the War on Drugs and the NSA spying.
But the linchpin of the whole thing is, of course, getting money out of politics. As such, all candidates for public office should be required to take public financing (no more private donors or self-funding), the bar for a party to receive federal public financing for its candidates should be lowered, broadcast time should be set aside for a number of campaign events (including several debates between all of the candidates) at the local, state, and federal levels, and private groups should be forced to list all of their major donors in advertisements, either in large font kept on the screen for a certain minimum timespan, or said out loud at the same speed drug commercials have to list side effects. (Speaking of which, drugs should not be advertised on TV at all; the fact that we allow that is sheer lunacy.)
As far as readings on governmental organization/structure, I guess the obvious ones are Plato's *Republic*, Locke, J.S. Mill, Hobbes, Burke, and I guess Marx, but I suspect you've encountered most of those already. As far as employee-owned companies, look into a guy named Jack Stack; he's a major figure in that scene (IIRC, he runs a company that the workers bought from its owners when it was about to close its doors during a harsh recession, and they diversified the company thoroughly to recession-proof it; I read an article in which he said that layoffs are "a failure of management," and apparently he's avoided ever having to do any layoffs at his company, or at least, he had at the time the article was printed).
Oh, and one more thing: I think you're getting a fair amount of misinformation about unions. Certainly there are unions out there demanding raises that governments can't afford to pay, but I think the majority of public union workers actually took pay cuts after the 2008 crash in order to help share in the sacrifices state governments had to make. I know for a fact that this was the case in Connecticut, where I live; my mother is in fact a unionized state employee, and she was furloughed a few times during that time period under an agreement between the state and the union. I suspect you're getting information about unions from someone who has a strong anti-union agenda; you can find corrupt unions just like you can find welfare and food-stamp fraud, but in both cases the vast majority are playing fair. Do I think unions are perfect, or that they never make unreasonable demands? No, that's foolish. But would I rather see unions grow stronger than weaker, all other things being equal? Absolutely; today's corporations run roughshod over their almost entirely non-unionized workforces. Gone are pensions; gone are corporate perks; gone are the days when an hourly worker's wages could support a whole family. Today, median earnings for American families are *declining*, and this is primarily due to the increased centralization of corporate power and the near-total destruction of private-sector unions that has accompanied it. (In other words, the employers have all the bargaining chips now; and workers are, in general, starting from a terrible negotiating position.)
I am curious about your problem with wages themselves; though. It is similar to Marx's complaint that employment is by its very nature exploitative? If not, can you make a stab at explaining it, or at least point me to one elsewhere? Thanks!
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:02:03
And as a bonus, you can provide a non-trusted computer (like your web server, for instance) with your master public key to generate payment addresses. This ensures that your funds cannot be stolen by hacking the non-trusted computer, while still allowing for a payment system that doesn't reuse addresses.

We'll be generous and assume you have a core i7-3930k, which gets, [according to the wiki]( 66.6 MH/s, and we'll be even more generous and assume you were able to push it to 100 MH/s. We'll also assume that your CPU only pulls stock wattage, at 130W, to perform this feat.
Now, the difficulty is currently 1,418,481,395. If you multiply this number by 2^32 you will get the number of hashes you need to perform, on average, to find a block, which is 6,092,331,201,509,457,920, or ~6.1 x 10^18.
You perform 1 x 10^8 hashes per second, so it will take you ~6.1 x 10^10 seconds, or 705,130.92 days, or 1,931.86 years to find a block at the current difficulty, on average.
So, your odds are certainly better, at 1 in 705,131 every day, than the lottery would be, but the better question is not, "What are the odds?" but rather, "What is the expected value, and is that more or less than the price of entry?" (Expected value is the value of the prize multiplied by the chance of winning it per entry, expressed as a fraction.)
In this case, the prize is 25 BTC, or about $25,000. If we assume you pay the average US rate at ~$0.12/kwh, you're paying ~$0.3744 per day for the privilege of trying to mine a block (and keep in mind, your computer will not be able to do anything else unless it has multiple CPUs, so that's not really even the only cost). We'll use the power cost as our price per "entry."
As for the expected value:
    ( 1 / 715,130.92 ) * $25,000 = ~$0.035
This works out to ~9.47% of the price per "entry."
Now, what about the lottery? Well, a PowerBall ticket costs $2, and the odds of winning the PowerBall jackpot are 1 in 175,223,510, so to have a worse expected-value-to-price ratio than mining (given the assumptions above), the PowerBall jackpot has to be less than ~$33.2M. (And just to be clear, the jackpot is typically larger than this, so in most cases PowerBall tickets are a better "investment" than electricity for CPU mining.)
(Note that this does not take taxes into account for either mining or the PowerBall, and keep in mind that they do apply in either case, should you get lucky. Note also that these numbers will shift drastically as you bring the assumptions back into line with reality.)

Hey, just out of curiosity, are all of your power supplies showing lights on in the back? If any of them aren't lighting up, try removing the flange thing, pushing the grey lever thing down, and pull out the PSU. Then push it back in and wiggle it around and keep trying to turn it on to see if it lights up. Apparently the PSUs can come loose from the socket and not work. I got an RMA back from them appearing to be dead, and they had me try that and it worked, so I thought I'd pass it on (especially since it's entirely possible that the issue I had in the first place was caused by the same problem, which they never mentioned to me prior to RMAing).

BitID will likely work for the vast majority of such applications. For mine, I was planning on accepting messages from users in plaintext and using signatures to verify their authenticity, but I can pretty easily conceive of a workaround that would allow the use of BitID, so that ought to suffice (the primary issue is one of verifying that specific instructions did, in fact, originate from the owner of an address to which payment is being made).

I happen to agree, which is why I support regulation to mandate the separation of banks from investment banks. Moreover, regulation of what exchanges can and cannot do does not amount to a "safety net." People will still be able to lose money, and indeed, exchanges will probably still get hacked. But who ends up owing money (or Bitcoin),  and what the rules are if something catastrophic happens, is something that isn't established currently. We need regulation to establish exactly these points. Exchanges will almost certainly not be bailed out if they fail, but there should be a set of requirements in place to prevent problems from getting as out of hand as they did at Gox (like independent auditing requirements, which would have found the problem much earlier).


What's the current rate of inflation? Do you know? Here's a [chart]( It hasn't topped 2.4% in years! You're more likely losing out worse on even more intangible things like lower raises being given out, or fewer jobs being available, than you are by inflation. And anyway, unless you hold onto very large amounts of money in cash or liquid bank deposits for an extended period of time, you're not getting hit by inflation, because it gets priced into asset values.


TARP was paid back. The pittance we gave the automakers (in government terms, it wasn't a lot of money) is being paid back. So no money was actually taken from you.


I agree here, but this is a case of an uncompetitive oligopolistic industry, not a problem with government or regulation.


Why would it have been better if there weren't any regulations to get in the way? There would surely have been far more examples to list if there were fewer regulations. You say regulation doesn't stop it, but the reality is that if it were easier, more people would do it, not fewer. Every other day I hear about a new scam in Bitcoinland, it seems like, and why? Because there's no one to stop it. I'm not saying Bitcoin itself needs to fundamentally change, but for trusted entities like exchanges, there *have to be* rules in place. And there's absolutely no way to run an exchange without requiring that it be a trusted entity.

Unfortunately, he's not "just wrong" about the second part--the larger the block, the slower it propagates (both because it takes a bit longer to transmit over the wire, and because it takes longer for each node to verify each included transaction and thus determine that it is, in fact, a valid block). Removing the hard 1MB limit won't fix this problem, so there is always going to be at least some downward pressure on block sizes. The hope is that improvements in bandwidth price and availability (in other words, improved Internet infrastructure) and computing power (and in this case, more cores is just as good as faster clock speeds) will help to limit the downward pressure as time goes on, but Bitcoin is catching on faster than I think anyone could have predicted, so we may not have as much time to wait for said improvements as was originally thought.

Ah, a strict constructionist. So, do you live West of the Mississippi? Because if so, then by your own belief system, you may not live in the United States, because Jefferson (one of those founders you strict constructionists insist made perfectly clear their intent in the original document, and who was indeed among the *original* strict constructionists) made the Louisiana Purchase without any Constitutionally-enumerated power to do so. As such, any of the territory thus added is not Constitutionally part of the United States, according to your interpretation.


I see you've redefined the term "counterfeit." Unfortunately for you, our legal system has not.


Actually, given that the paper money we use today consists of bank notes (specifically, those of the Federal Reserve), we are in a very similar situation to that of the early United States under the Constitution. Back then, there was a bank, chartered by the federal government but nevertheless privately owned, which had the power to issue paper bank notes, while the federal government produced coins. As such, it seems the Founders would have found our current system relatively familiar, in fact.

Ah, but slicing and dicing them into tranches with different levels of risk was! And they merrily bullied the ratings agencies to rate the resulting products AAA, and everyone was happy--until 2008, when it all came crashing down.
EDIT: Also, there *were* actually a number of innovative new subprime loan products, such as the infamous Adjustable Rate Mortgage, which started the borrower at a very low payment, but eventually jumped to a much higher payment later on. ARMs helped to disguise subprime loans by making it look like the borrower was able to pay (because they were, initially) when in fact there wasn't a chance they could pay back all of the principal in anything like the term of the loan (let alone the interest on that principal). This created a sort of "ticking time bomb" effect. (That happened with Enron, too--they essentially borrowed tons of money to bet hugely on their stock price, with the condition that if they lost, they'd issue more stock to pay the money back, and they did this multiple times, so when their stock price finally went down, a nasty feedback loop was unleashed.)

You're really not getting it.

His point is that such fixed ratios cannot be declared by fiat for cryptocurrencies, and indeed that such an idea goes against the whole point of cryptocurrencies. Thus, his whole point is that we essentially *can't* achieve any kind of real stability in exchange rates between cryptocurrencies.
If you disagree with *that*, you'd best write a paper and submit it to an econ journal, because you're disagreeing with peer-reviewed research.

Actually, TARP was paid back, and the automakers are in the process of paying back their bailouts as well. So the bailouts didn't actually cost taxpayers a dime. Oops!


CPI is extremely low. The country is losing a lot more money in opportunity costs because so many people are unemployed and hence unproductive. EDIT: Let me be clear: the *only* reason the Fed is still printing money is because Congress refuses to act to provide fiscal stimulus to relieve unemployment (which would actually have an impact on Main Street, rather than just on Wall Street, which is pretty much all that the Fed's printing ends up doing). It's not the Fed's fault that it has crappy tools (namely, QE) to work with to solve this problem (namely, unemployment), given that it shouldn't have to be dealing with this problem on its own to begin with.


Good to know you get to decide what's moral and what's not. Beyond that, I'm sure you'd be much happier having to get your food lab-tested on a regular basis to avoid such problems as the melamine-in-baby-formula problem in China (which, incidentally, happened in New York City in the 19th century, prior to the passage of the Food and Drug Act). That's merely one example, but if you consider all regulation immoral, then it's a perfectly valid example.
EDIT: more -&gt; moral
EDIT 2: Adding another bullet point after the fact? Ok...


While I can't really argue that the United States is not constantly involved in some sort of military action, nor that there has been a time in recent history when that was true, this is a complicated issue. I personally would prefer to pull all of our military forces out of their various locations, but not only am I not empowered to make such a decision, many of the locales in which US troops are stationed would not be pleased to see them go (though many would). In addition, the massive and continuing demand for oil in the United States has resulted in our country's insinuating itself into Middle Eastern affairs, to the detriment of the region and those in this country who suffered when certain factions in the region took it upon themselves to take vengeance upon us. Oil is hardly unique as a commodity for which the United States government was willing to engage in callous murder and warfare, but it is the most obvious and perhaps the best example. So, in a sense, to paraphrase Mick Jagger, "[you] shouted out, 'Who killed [those people]?'/When after all, it was you and me."
Moreover, the printing press has not been used to finance the "endless wars," which have been financed either by deficit spending or by taxation.

It used to be that a node did both a) and b), but these days the two jobs are separated so that a mining pool server maintains a node that validates transactions and builds them into the block it sends out to the miners in the pool, who are connecting their mining clients to the server to receive work that they then hash.
Note that *every* node validates transactions, whether mining or not, and forwards valid transactions to its peers. So the transaction fees are not paid out upon validation, but upon inclusion in a block, and they are paid to the address(es) specified in the block header that was hashed to produce the block. As has been pointed out, block rewards take time to be considered confirmed.
It might be helpful at this point to have a fuller understanding of how mining works. A SHA-256 hash value is a 256-bit binary number, and the hash value of one input is almost always drastically different from that of a slightly different input, and the result of a SHA-256 hash cannot be predicted from the input data except by performing the hash. The Bitcoin protocol sets a *target* value, which is an arbitrarily low 256-bit binary number, and to be considered a valid block, a block header must have a hash value *less* than that target value. Because the hash of the previous block is included in a block header, the accepted blocks form a chain, and there is always something to hash for mining (when a block is found, a mining node simply sets the previous block hash to the new block's hash, makes any necessary changes to the transactions one is including in the block being hashed for mining, and continues hashing. (In order to change the block header slightly for each hash, the header includes a nonce field, which is a number that can be incremented by the mining client. This has recently become insufficient, so the coinbase transaction, which pays out the block reward, now generally includes an ExtraNonce value to allow miners to keep creating new inputs to hash.)

That's a really fascinating and exciting idea, and although I'm somewhat concerned about the possibility for centralization of wealth even here, I very much hope to be proven wrong. If you do succeed in the fashion you're envisioning (the empowerment of the people by providing them access to means of production, and the ability to empower others by making use of that production capacity), I think it would end up amounting to something much like what Marx was envisioning, wherein the workers, rather than the owners of capital, control the means of production and benefit from its use. (I think Marx's problem lies in his ideas for achieving socialism, rather than the concept itself, personally.)
I do agree that Communist countries have not been what one would characterize as good places to live, and that communism has tended to lead to economic stagnation because of a lack of incentives. That said, it seems to me that you're confronting essentially the same problems that Marx saw in the world, and working towards a similar end, but via a completely different approach and a widely differing ideological viewpoint.

You have identified an insurance policy that is being forced upon you (since your tax dollars pay for the police force). So, you should get cracking on convincing your local townspeople to eliminate the police force, since forced insurance policies are such a terrible thing, and people shouldn't be taught to rely on others, and all.
While you're at it, get rid of those pesky costs for firefighters. Why should you have to pay to prevent fires in neighborhoods full of stupid people? You're smart enough to choose sensible neighbors who won't set their houses on fire and thus won't endanger yours! And if they do, you know perfectly well how to use a fire hydrant and can hook up a hose no problem to keep the flames away from your house, because you don't believe in letting yourself be trained to rely on others!

That's actually not safer than diceware or other randomly-generated passphrases of the same length as yours. A passphrase in natural language, even one peppered with alterations and random symbols, is far more vulnerable to cracking by [Markov Chain]( than a randomly-generated one (because there is no logic in which word comes next for the randomly-generated passphrase, while there is a natural progression of words in any natural sentence).
However, if your short story is one that you wrote yourself and has never been posted on the Internet *ever*, then you should still be safe.

Without even looking for a source, I can name a case where a woman was killed by a man with a gun in a domestic dispute: the Oscar Pistorius case. Can you name a women who defended herself in a domestic dispute from an armed man, without looking on Google?
Moreover, it's one thing to say you can shoot an intruder--someone who is in your home without permission and might do you great harm. It's another entirely to suggest that someone can just up and shoot his/her significant other when that other is in a rage. (I don't know about you, but I've always loved my significant other, and I doubt I could kill her, even in self-defense.) It also requires the potential victim to think of and get to the gun(s) first (and they're usually all kept in the same place), or at least in time to not get shot. This is not a typical response to a domestic dispute, and I would hate to live in a world where it had to be the default response.
And beyond that, men are bigger and stronger than women. If the woman goes for a gun to try to protect herself, the man is likely to get even angrier, and he'll nearly always have no trouble keeping her away from the guns. Adding guns to a domestic dispute is always bad. Period.

I'll go ahead and add those suggestions to my reading list, but it would take too long to read them before responding. So, I'm afraid we'll have to continue without the benefit of that information.
That said, allow me to ask a couple of questions:
For one, what makes you so sure that it's the hierarchy itself that causes all of the problems? I don't deny that abuse of power rears its ugly head virtually everywhere, but I'm sure you recognize that there are sound reasons for establishing hierarchies even though such problems occur. You mentioned unions a post or two back; I don't deny that unions have a significant problem with corruption, but consider *why* unions exist: because without them, working conditions get worse and wages get lower. Don't just take my word for it, though--look at history: unions formed in the latter half of the 19th century as a response to extremely low wages, shockingly poor working conditions, and in many cases, wage slavery (wherein the only source of goods for workers was the "company store" whose prices were carefully calibrated to keep workers in debt, thus preventing them from leaving the company without paying off the remaining funds owed; such schemes are illegal today but were common at the time). At the height of union power was the era now often thought of as a golden age for the American economy: the 1950s and '60s. It was then that the minimum wage reached its inflation-adjusted peak. Since then, unions have slowly lost influence, and today, corporations are again running roughshod over workers: pensions are a thing of the past, ordinary Americans have actually seen a *decline* in inflation-adjusted income, and those making minimum wage generally need to work multiple jobs in order to provide for a family, even when the household has *two* wage-earners (versus the typical *one* in the 1970s and previously), and job perks like a company car or having the company buy you a *house* (and yes, they used to do this for executives back in the 1960s) are unheard-of.
So, as is the case with unions, a hierarchy may create new problems, but these are nearly always less bad than the problems the hierarchy was created to solve. (As another example, take government itself: it was better to have government, even if it could be abused, than to allow marauding bands of raiders to simply rape and pillage as they pleased--this is why we *have* government in the first place. I have yet to hear how such problems would be handled in an anarchist system.)
Getting back to asking questions: Assuming that hierarchy is at least the greatest source of problems, if not the source of all problems, how do you go about handling the various challenges government was built to solve in an anarchist system? For this, it's probably helpful to go back to the firefighting example. You corrected my mistaken assumption that you are an anarcho-capitalist (I hope you'll forgive the assumption, given that this is and asserted that the firefighting organization would not be driven by the profit motive. I must confess to being at even more of a loss in understanding how the organization would function without even the profit motive, so please explain.
As for your question, I have my own ideas about how best to organize society, both in terms of changes I'd like to see in the current system and in how to best organize society. I don't often share them on this subreddit, because I'm on the left of the political spectrum (but still in favor of government in the abstract) and hence, my views are not terribly popular here. Also, with regard to how to organize society, my ideas are brand-new, as far as I can tell, and are therefore completely untested.
Of course, by now I've likely piqued your curiosity, so here goes:
I envision a realignment of the incentives in the capitalist system by giving workers total ownership of the companies they work for--including the power to decide what direction the company should take, which many of today's "employee-owned" firms do not afford their workers--and making said companies completely transparent (which is one positive aspect of unions--everyone knows how much everyone else is being paid). This way, the executives that make up the corporate hierarchy (if there has to be one; I've heard about a tomato company in California that has no executive hierarchy at all; I have yet to investigate their model more fully, but if possible I'd like to adapt it to my own ideas) are accountable to the employees they manage, and the union *is* the company, so they won't have (nearly as much of) an incentive to push for compensation levels that are not sustainable in the long term. (Of course, to be able to properly test these ideas, I would need to be in a position to give away a large corporation to its workers, and I am, sadly, nowhere near being in such a position.)

How do you plan to make an exchange cryptographically secure, for one, without making it way too slow (by requiring users to sign the transaction after matching takes place, allowing them to change their minds prior to completing the trade if the exchange rate goes a certain way), and for two, how do you plan on getting fiat money into your decentralized exchange without having some trusted entity (aka centralization) to process payments?
I'm aware of Open Transactions, by the way, but they have not offered a solution to the trust problem for fiat currency; you still have to trust the "asset issuer" to issue only real assets and not fake ones that don't exist.
PS: No cop-outs involving individuals making/taking payment to one another via the banking system (or in person), either. Not only does that open up the potential for individual prosecutions, it also makes payment such a hassle that your theoretical "popular" attribute would be all but impossible to achieve.

Is that constructive enough for you?
EDIT: Was misremembering; it costs about $1 million to get licensed in all US states. A million dollars is still insufficient, though; those are just basic compliance costs, and mostly likely not even all of them (there being other laws to comply with besides state money transmitter licensing laws, after all).

First of all, there's natural variation in the rate at which blocks are found (sometimes the whole network is just unlucky, and by the same token, the remaining honest half might get super-lucky and make it look like everything is normal), so it wouldn't necessarily be that obvious. Secondly, you're assuming that the attacker is hijacking honest miners' hashing power, as in the "rogue pool operator" concept; this is not the only way to perform a 51% attack. For example, if the NSA were to start building sha256d ASICs, they could perform a 51% attack once they had more hashing power than the rest of the network (and yes, such a thing is well within their annual budget, even now). So it's not necessarily true that there has to be some kind of warning sign in the block-finding rate.

An attentive reader will notice nothing of the sort. That tech fields are hostile is in addition to the fact that girls aren't encouraged in math and science; the two are hardly mutually exclusive. Why you should think so is completely beyond me. Moreover, the attitude you're displaying right now ("girls just aren't interested in tech stuff") generally translates into saying things like "Computer science isn't for everyone" to a girl when she's struggling with a concept when one might not say the same to a guy having the same problem (not saying you do this, but many do, and if you do, you should know that you're contributing to the problem).
I also fail to see how I've "backed off" on the finance point. I would expect finance to be hostile to women for similar reasons as tech (especially as the two begin to merge), but all I said was that you don't necessarily have to be into finance to get into Bitcoin (but you also don't necessarily have to be into tech, either, even though finance and tech are the primary fields that lead people to Bitcoin).

Note that the economists' arguments, which I think hold weight if you're talking about a situation in which prices are set in Bitcoin (and are, for the most part, unchanging, the way fiat prices are now) and everyone uses it without ever considering the exchange rate, drop out of consideration completely if you don't try to make it a currency. Deflation? So what? Prices can adjust to reflect the exchange rate. (Actually, it's not even technically deflation if it's not a currency.) The same goes for volatility.

Now, the rise of giant ASIC farms is indeed alarming. But so far, it doesn't appear that any of these farms is really so large as to create a problem, because there are quite a few of them. My hope is that as ASIC hardware gets cheaper, more mining operations will spring up to ensure that, even though a large percentage of the total hashing power will be made up of large farms, there will be enough such farms that none of them is dangerously large and competition is sufficient to keep them all in check.

Part of the reason the community is so obnoxiously libertarian is that the regulations that apply to a money transfer business are extremely difficult for a small startup to comply with, so we have a case where outdated regulations really are stifling potential innovation.

People don't spoon-feed you unless they get paid to do so. That's why Bitminter is so easy to use: because they charge a fee for mining at their pool!
So, I'm sorry this *completely free software* (which, incidentally, enables you to *make more money* than you ordinarily would) isn't sufficiently easy for you to use. You have two options: fix it yourself, or pay somebody to do so. Whining about it is not useful.
@_date: 2014-04-09 14:53:57
Other people have covered most of your options. I would only add that for most Bitcoin wallet software, if you import your paper wallet key and spend coins, ***any remaining coins not spent are usually redirected to a "change" address within the wallet*** which means that your paper wallet ***no longer contains ANY bitcoins***. As such, ***DO NOT DELETE*** any wallet into which you have imported a paper wallet until you have moved all coins to a new paper wallet.
EDIT: The explanation for this is that transactions consist of inputs and outputs, with later transactions using outputs from previous transactions as inputs. Each input must be spent in its entirety; part of it sent to the recipient, part to a change address, and, for any remaining funds whose destination is not specified, to the miner who finds the block as a transaction fee. As such, if you send 10 BTC to your paper wallet all at once, it only has one output of size 10 BTC, so if you import the key to a "hot" wallet and spend 0.5 BTC, the 10 BTC output is split up as 0.5 BTC to the recipient, 9.4999 back to a "change" address (which is controlled by a key in the "hot" wallet), and 0.0001 left to be claimed by the lucky miner. If you then delete the "hot" wallet, your 9.4999 BTC is left inaccessible forever (unless you can recover the keys from the deleted "hot" wallet), since your paper wallet no longer has control of those coins.

Excuse me? I understand networking in-depth. I've written C code to manually open a socket and connect to a server. I'd say I have a better understanding of networking than you do.
And you're just so damn sure that technology will obviate the problems mentioned that you don't even bother to include a timescale. But let's start at the top and go through the problems with your thesis, shall we?
a) Hardware:
As I said, Bitcoin is catching on much faster than hardware is improving. Especially when you start to talk about network infrastructure, given that most places in the United States have seen no increase in available bandwidth for years now. I know the situation is better in other places, but it's also worse in many places. And as for processors, Bitcoin has grown by a lot more than a factor of two every 18 months, which means it's far outpacing hardware improvements.
Besides which, if it takes the very latest and greatest in network connectivity and computer hardware to run a full node, you're going to, as bobalot says, end up with supernodes upon which vast numbers of users depend, rather than a decentralized system.
b) Software:
I'm a software engineer. Software is not a field in which exponential increases occur, except insofar as the number of projects may grow exponentially with the sector of the population capable of developing new software. But we are not seeing exponential increases in programmer productivity.
Moreover, it's not even clear what you mean here. How is software going to solve problems with the levels of bandwidth available to the average Internet user, or how fast processors take to check an ECDSA signature? (In fact, we may have to slow them down rather than speed them up in cases where the implementation is vulnerable to a potential leakage of keys when running on a VM with an attacker's VM running on the same hardware, though I admittedly don't know the specifics of how to mitigate that attack.)
c) Adoption:
Did you not read what I said? If adoption continues apace, we're going to see way too many transactions way sooner than anyone thought, meaning we'll have to confront the issues involved in raising or eliminating the block size cap (those of bandwidth and CPU speed that I mentioned previously) too soon for technology to save us. This point makes even less sense than the software one (though I think the cryptography one is perhaps the least sensible of all).
d) Cryptography:
Do you understand what advances in crypto typically are? They're attacks to undermine the strength of existing algorithms. That doesn't help us. Or they're new algorithms, which are typically even more computing-intensive than previous ones. Either way, Bitcoin benefits not at all.
Anyway, it's clear that you don't know what you're talking about. Good day!

They're by no means suggesting any of this is unique to virtual currencies; that would be ridiculous, given that Mr. Ponzi's actual scheme involved dollars. They're merely warning investors (read: people who are or may become involved in Bitcoin or other virtual currencies) that there are a lot of fraudsters and risky investments in the space. If you think that isn't true, you obviously haven't been paying attention.

Thanks for the reply. It occurs to me that I didn't provide my thoughts about a decentralized exchange: to the extent that it can be ensured cryptographically that people aren't being cheated, I would be wholeheartedly in favor. I do not oppose finding technological ways to solve problems that have been traditionally been solved by legal means--though I have often been a critic of trying to solve human problems by technological means, I only criticize instances where people are trying to use technology to solve problems it simply cannot solve, such as violence.
And also, I'm very much in favor (and not nearly so skeptical about the possibility) of decentralized marketplaces in which goods and services are sold for Bitcoin. The community will need to work with law enforcement in instances where really bad things are happening (murder, child porn, human trafficking, etc), but I am of the firm conviction that the drug war is entirely immoral and counterproductive, so decentralized marketplaces don't bother me in the least.
My biggest problem with the libertarian insistence on no regulation is that it's completely asinine--as you yourself pointed out, there are technologies coming which will completely circumvent the imminent regulations, if one happens to be an individual doing small-time transactions like buying some drugs for oneself. (No mixer will protect someone trying to launder 50x the usual volume, though, so cartels and terrorists are still going to be fairly easy to catch, which is all to the good in my view.) Given that, why should it matter if the public-facing exchanges are regulated? It seems to me that such regulation will only help the public image and make ordinary people feel safer about using Bitcoin (hell, it may even actually *make* them safer, by creating standards for accounting and security at exchanges). It could even ensure the trustworthiness your hypothesized fiat&lt;==&gt;colored-coin exchange, thus enabling a decentralized exchange to feature fiat money.

For tax purposes, the distinction you're making here is immaterial; you still owe income tax on the fair market value of the coins you've received as of the time you received them.
For other purposes, however, your definition is problematic. FinCEN recently stated that those mining for themselves are not money transmitters and do not have to comply with money transmission regulations, but those mining on behalf of others are engaging in money transmission, and do have to follow the appropriate regulations.
So, the argument you're making is not only unhelpful but actually harmful to your interests. Personally, and just as a matter of semantics, I would view the pool operator as offering a service to miners (the pooling of risk) and being paid for it by way of a percentage of funds earned, rather than the other way around.

This is completely untrue where facts about a particular person are concerned. Are you familiar with the term "libel"?
That said, media organizations often do report falsehoods that are never corrected, such as the claim, in the aftermath of the Columbine shooting, that the two perpetrators were bullied by their classmates. In fact, everyone pretty much left them alone; the motivation for the shooting (which was originally intended to be a bombing, but fortunately the bomb failed to go off) was one kid's sociopathy, and he manipulated the other kid, who was suicidal, into going along with it. These things were never reported, but the reason is that no one is going to come sue the media organizations over it (no individual students were accused of bullying, and the media's narrative actually engendered more sympathy for the perpetrators than the truth would have, so no one had any reason to cry foul). When you print something about someone that is not true, which materially harms the person in question, you can be essentially certain you'll face one or more lawsuits.

I have trouble understanding why Bitcoin ***has*** to be a currency. What's wrong with a payment system that also functions as an asset for speculating on that system's level of use (which also allows the system to remunerate participants for contributing computing power to the system's security)? That's already something impressive. Economists complain that no one ever prices anything *in bitcoins*. I say, why is that relevant, if Bitcoin is used to make payment? We have computers that can adjust the price in response to the slightest change in the exchange rate, and there are already companies that do the conversion for the merchant, for less than it currently costs to accept a payment, so how is the whole currency issue relevant?
Note that this is a question directed not only at the economists who keep pointing out that it doesn't quite work as a currency, but also the Bitcoiners who argue vehemently that they're wrong (because in doing so, they implicitly accept the assumption that it *has* to work as a currency).

You're pretty close to the mark here; the piece you're missing is what's known as a Merkle Tree, which is a binary hash tree. Here's how it works:
I have five transactions, A, B, C, D, and E, which represent the bottom tier of the tree. I hash each one, to get hash(A), hash(B), hash(C), hash(D), and hash(E). Then I take each pair, concatenate their hashes, and hash the result to get the next tier in the tree, so I now have:
    hash(hash(A) + hash(B))
    hash(hash(C) + hash(D))
    hash(hash(E) + hash(E))
Note that we take E twice, because it's the odd one out. We keep doing this all the way up, until there's only one hash left, called the Merkle Root. As a result, you can look up individual transactions without needed to know what all the transactions in the block are, by simply having what's known as a Merkle Branch, where you're given the transaction you want at the bottom, its hash, the hash of its partner (that was concatenated with its hash and then hashed), and so on up to the root hash. From this you can verify that the a particular transaction was, in fact, included in a block, without needing to store every last transaction, which you would have to do if you were simply hashing them all together.
Anyway, that's a longwinded explanation of something you weren't asking about! :P On to your question:
Miners can do basically whatever they want. Yes, mining is for including transactions into the blockchain, but there's no rule that says you have to include any transactions at all (other than what's known as self-interest, given that transactions typically pay fees), and some miners don't include any. A miner could also include only transactions made by his own friends and family, if he wanted. (This is part of the reason a 51% attack would be so bad--because the attacker could prevent any transactions from taking place by not including any.)
In any case, to answer your question, miners can choose to include the new transaction or ignore it, as they prefer. This decision gets more complex when you start talking about pooled mining, however, since the server has to get the new work units out to all the miners when it adds a new transaction to the block it's trying to mine, so there is a cost associated with adding every transaction when it arrives. Not having ever run a pool myself, I have no idea how pool operators typically handle this, but I would guess that their approaches vary.

See: rates of women in tech in America and other Western countries vs the rates in Asian countries. (This is the biggest one, I think--tech is a hostile field for women in the West, in general. It's not necessarily obvious, but men in tech have an unfortunate tendency to talk down to women without even realizing it, and when that happens constantly during college and then in the workplace besides, a lot of women drop out before even getting started, and the ones that do get started often end up leaving for other fields.)

I believe I have been consistent in opposing the use of technology as a solution for social or political problems (because I don't think it works), but this goes two ways: we also can't blame technology for worsening our social or political problems, because the issue, in both cases, is that we have work to do in the social and political arenas that has yet to be done.
In this particular case, I think the problem is campaign finance itself. I don't think the market should have anything to do with political campaigns; rather, I would prefer to have large blocks of broadcast time set aside in the weeks preceding Election Day for debates, forums, townhalls, and other campaign events where all candidates would consider issues (this would include time for candidates at the local, state, and federal levels). (I believe something similar to this is already done in Australia, as is mandatory voting, which I also think is a good idea--though it works better in a country with a 100% literacy rate.) Moreover, I think public financing of campaigns should be mandatory, and donations to political campaigns forbidden. According to current legal precedent from the Supreme Court (specifically, *Citizens United*), we can't preclude the use of donated money for political advertising, but we can preclude the necessity of obtaining it in the modern US political campaign.
(This reform would, of course, require a restructuring of the requirements for a party's candidate to qualify for public financing, to ensure that third-party candidates get a fair shot.)

You're incorrect--I'm not one of those that thinks this is particularly likely to happen anytime soon, but if the government were to collapse, then the money would end up worthless, just as you postulate could happen to Bitcoin. This is an academic discussion at this point, because it is widely ***agreed*** that the US government is extremely unlikely to collapse in the foreseeable future, but during the American Revolution, it was a highly relevant concern, because it meant people were generally unwilling to accept US paper money at face value (and some simply refused to take it at all) because the risk of collapse for the new republic was rather high, taking on, as it was, the most powerful military on the planet at the time.
The key point in all of this is that value is a quality that requires agreement. People wrongly assume that government backing is the pertinent quality that lends value, when in fact it's the agreement of value that government backing creates that gives fiat money its value. Government backing is merely one way to achieve an agreement of value for something that has no inherent utility, but that doesn't mean that it's the only way.
In other words, fiat has an enforced agreement, while Bitcoin does not. You're right that this fact makes Bitcoin a riskier place to store value, but you're mistaken in assuming that this refutes the fact that value arises out of mutual agreement among people.

You said I have a "hateful agenda." We only discussed regulating exchanges and the minimum wage. Neither of which strikes me as "hateful." I gave you a ration of shit because you assume that I meant that I had seen savers for whom "it all worked out," when what I meant was that they don't have any savings. How many poor people have you ever met in your life? It sounds like you're a kid, pontificating on matters about which you have no clue, because you've lived a sheltered life.


...what? TARP kept the housing market from *completely* imploding. The primary impact of TARP was to prevent everything from collapsing into economic chaos. You think borrowers would have had an easier time financing a home if TARP hadn't gone through and all the banks collapsed? Because if so, you're either ignorant of the facts or utterly blinded by ideology.


See, most people don't have savings, and as such they don't care what the inflation rate is. I said there were no poor-but-frugal savers out there getting screwed by inflation, and you assumed I meant that they put it in stocks or something. That implies that your default assumption about people is that they have savings, which says a lot about you. Maybe I overstated the case, but you've led a privileged life if that's your default assumption about people, even if you do recognize that not everyone has savings.

Who is your final "they" in that comment? The farms, or GHash.io? The latter decreased in size because of the *community response* to seeing GHash.io gain an outsize hashrate share. As for CEX.io, that mining farm is a tad on the large side, but smaller than ASICMINER was at its peak, and it has several competitors, which ASICMINER did not.
As such, while I think it is indeed necessary for the community to respond when it becomes clear that a particular pool is growing too large, I don't see that there's truly a problem in need of fixing at this juncture (nor do any of the proposals actually solve what might be termed the "farm problem," probably, again, because there is really no way around the 51% problem given Bitcoin's design, and because it has been proven that there is no perfect solution to the Byzantine Generals problem).

2. Bitcoin itself may well be doing fine without regulation, but if you think the same can be said for Bitcoin exchanges, you're batshit insane. Roughly half of all exchanges have failed, almost all of which have taken their customers' money with them in one fashion or another (getting hacked, running off with the money, whatever the fuck happened at Gox, etc).
3. How about a quote that's actually cringeworthy? "Good to know: NY is actively hostile to de-centralized finance and crypto-currencies. They spread FUD, un-hindered by facts."

Fun fact: it already has been, sort of. The protocol for this, which would allow pooled miners to control the transactions they include or exclude from the block they're mining, is called getblocktemplate. It was developed because the old getwork protocol became obsolete with the introduction of ASICs, which burn through the maximum amount of work that can be supplied by getwork far too fast to make pooled mining viable.
Unfortunately for decentralization, the stratum protocol, which doesn't allow miners the same flexibility, has won out over getblocktemplate as the mining protocol of choice for pools.

...that's why you don't save it in cash. You put it in bonds and stocks and other appreciating assets. Nobody who actually has significant savings has any reason to keep it in cash or a checking account, and except for the odd crazy, virtually no one does. There are no poor-but-frugal people out there saving money and losing out big-time on inflation; that's a ridiculous libertarian myth.


Bullshit. There was at least one, if not two financial panics every decade in the 19th century (I quickly got sick of having to remember details about so many damn "Panic of 18XX" events in US History).


Our current economy relies on people either spending or investing their money, yes. That's not a bad thing; if it weren't that way, you and I wouldn't have this website on which to have this conversation.
One last thing: "optional regulation" is by definition *not* regulation.
EDIT: Also, surely there's a middle ground between not allowing anyone to take any risks on the one hand (which you seem to be trying to pigeonhole me as arguing, though I'm not) and allowing scammers to run roughshod over unsophisticated consumers on the other? I don't have any problem with letting people risk their money, but there's a difference between that and letting just anyone take risks with *other people's* money (and whenever anyone accepts a Bitcoin deposit from a consumer in the manner of an exchange, that's exactly what they're doing) without being properly vetted beforehand.

This list is terrible. Most of these aren't even actual properties of Bitcoin. The actual properties discussed are thus:
1. Global reach
2. No central point of failure
3. Impossibility of counterfeit
4. Transparency
5. Programmability (example: multisig)
6. Record permanence
7. Un-restrictability
The list is a hodgepodge of various spins on these properties and bits of the author's political and economic ideologies.
And, as others have said, the author briefly gets at the idea that intrinsic value is an imaginary concept (bread is more valuable to a starving person than a well-fed one, even though the item itself is exactly the same) and then bizarrely abandons it to try to prove that Bitcoin somehow has this nonexistent property.

First of all, proof-of-stake is not secure. There's no incentive not to mine on a dishonest chain (since you can just mine on *both* chains, instead), so it offers no real protection against an attack, even by someone with only a relatively small portion of the coins.
And a simple majority *of hashing power* is required *to be honest* for the blockchain solution to work. These are extremely important qualifiers. Bitcoin does not solve the Byzantine Generals Problem because it falls apart if those qualifiers do not hold true. As such, the proofs are right. The beauty of Bitcoin is that it represents a practical way to solve the problem in the real world in such a way that it is largely secure from attack. To actually represent a true mathematical solution, it would have to work even in the presence of overwhelming dishonest hashing power, which it doesn't.

Again, my point is not that Bitcoin is a safer store of value than fiat money at this point, nor that it's impossible for Bitcoin to lose all its value. All I'm pointing out is that things have value because people agree that they do. And you're right, if all of the Bitcoin exchanges were to collapse, a large number of people would decide that they no longer agreed that Bitcoin had value, and the price would tank. Certain people in this community will buy them no matter what, so they would likely retain some small value, but that's not really relevant--certain people would still believe in US dollars after a collapse of the government too, no doubt. The point is that agreement among people is the sole criterion for value, and if that is lost, so too is most or all of the value.

It seems our friends in Europe, Britain, and Australia (among other places where gun bans are in effect) do not feel that they are subjugated to the will of criminals. This doesn't really invalidate your point; the implied threat of possible violence comes from the state and its justice system rather than individuals. My point, though, is that there are apparently solutions that really work (according to the people actually involved) that don't involve arming the populace to the teeth, which has costs like the one I mentioned, in which guns become involved in domestic disputes (which I'm sure you realize is, for all intents and purposes, never a positive development). In addition, consider the number of suicides that wouldn't have happened had a depressed person not had access to such a quick and painless method of suicide--I would probably not be here typing this if I had had access to a firearm at certain points in my life.
I'm not in favor of an out-and-out ban on all guns, though. I have nothing against your shotguns and single-shot rifles (in my youth, I learned to shoot .22 bolt-action rifles, as it happens), but things like semi-automatic handguns have essentially no purpose beyond killing a very large amount of people very quickly, and in a civilized society no one should ever have need of that capability--except perhaps law enforcement, and I'm not even so sure about them, given how many innocent people have been killed by jumpy cops.

I'd say a better example would be an auto mechanic who either stole his customers cars or had them stolen from him (depending on what actually happened to those 650k BTC). I'm not sure there's a good digital analogy here.

It depends on the circumstances. If you're refusing to pay taxes, for example, and the Feds have already seized your paper wallet (or computer with an encrypted wallet on it, where the client allows the user to view the balance without decrypting the wallet), then there's no way that you could further incriminate yourself by divulging the password, since they already know what assets you control. As such, the Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination doesn't apply, and they could throw you in prison for refusal without any violation of the Constitution.
Contrast this with a situation in which you have documents stored in an encrypted hard drive which, if revealed to the authorities, would somehow incriminate you (perhaps you engaged in industrial espionage). In addition to this, your bitcoin wallet is stored on the same hard drive. In this situation, refusing a government demand for your password to the encrypted drive is covered by the Fifth Amendment, since allowing the government to decrypt the drive would be self-incriminating.

I would turn this around on you: Given that the current system demonstrably functions, albeit imperfectly, the burden of proof is on your side to prove that your model can actually work on its own in the real world. Currently your ideas appear to be in a period similar to that which Marxism experienced after Marx laid down his ideas but before anyone had attempted to make them a reality. (Some Marxists would argue that none of the eventual attempts followed Marx's exact model, and hence are invalid as data points, but such arguments are similar to arguments regarding free-market purity from the opposite end of the spectrum--if your model can't handle the pressures of the real world and remain intact, then what good is your model in its "pure" form?)
It's not at all clear that such institutions as firefighting organizations would function adequately in a private, profit-driven form. Who pays for firefighting, in your model? Is it a form of insurance that everyone has to pay? If so, doesn't that create the risk of a protection racket? Handwaving about competition ignores the reality that many industries do not lend themselves to competition due to barriers to entry and geographic constraints. (After all, how many firefighting companies can one little town realistically support?)

Apparently not clear enough. The phrase "No state shall..." means exactly what it says: no ***state*** shall establish money other than gold or silver coin. The federal government, however, is left free to establish whatever money it likes. The root of this is the fact that different states had established their own individual (paper) currencies during the period under the Articles of Confederation, and it was a total disaster for interstate trade, so the Founders wanted to avoid such a mess in the future.

This is more than simply an absence of denial; it's actually a tacit admission. To say one is "no longer" involved in something essentially says that one used to be. And "They are in charge of it now," combined with the following sentence, "I no longer have any connection," strongly implies that he himself was once in charge. It'll take a lot to convince me that this guy *isn't* the creator of Bitcoin.
That said, he clearly took strong measures to protect his identity (and to those wondering why he would have used his real name, consider that Satoshi Nakamoto is the Japanese equivalent of John Smith), so I must say that calling attention to him in this way is more than a little disrespectful to his desire for privacy, which he has made very clear. Right now I just feel bad for the guy more than anything else.

In general, I'd agree that he didn't wrong anyone by taking investments; although I do think we need laws to prevent slick used-car-salesman types from fleecing mom-and-pop investors, I dislike the way it's done under current law--I feel that there should be net worth-based limits on how much one can solicit from a given investor.
The reality is that these laws are still badly in need to updating, even though they've been modified to allow for smaller, Kickstarter-style IPOs (though such IPOs are severely hampered by the regulatory limits that have been put into place).
The point, though, is that he did just blithely go ahead and break the law, and made millions of dollars doing it, so this fine really is laughably small, and the people arguing that this is somehow an injustice really aren't letting the facts get in the way of their interpretation.

That's an incorrect reading of the Constitution you're going by:


Only states are restricted in what they can establish as money, not the Federal government. The reason for this is historical: Prior to the establishment of the Constitutional government of the United States, the country (if it could be called such at the time) was governed under the Articles of Confederation, which provided for an extremely weak federal government that had no real taxing authority, and as a result of the lack of federal standardization, each state printed its own paper money. This was not helpful to the economy of the newly-formed United States, so the Founders made sure to include the above language in the Constitution to ensure that the confusing situation that resulted would never happen again. (It did anyway, when virtually every bank ended up printing its own notes in the Nineteenth century, but that's another story.)
Moreover, there is nothing in the Constitution which strictly prohibits private banking in any way, so although there is indeed no language specifically permitting banking, your statement is quite misleading. I hardly think we would have gone literally the entire history of the United States without a successful Supreme Court challenge to the Constitutionality of banking, were that not the case (in fact, though I have admittedly not studied law, I'm not aware of *any* challenge to the Constitutionality of private banking ever reaching the Supreme Court).

Considering the infinite divisibility of bitcoins, the prices do not present a barrier to investment, And I don't think people are THAT irrational; no one buys Bitcoins just for the hell of it, before they know what they might buy with them. They either are already planning a purchase, or they are trying to invest in BTC. If the price is at rock-bottom, there won't be many goods or services available for Bitcoins, and only the most risk-tolerant investors will be interested in investing in them.
Also, any vendor that sells at fixed BTC prices is just foolish, given that, as I said, it is currently impossible to pay for gas, food, or electricity (among many other things) with Bitcoins, and that's unlikely to change any time soon. Unless and until that does change, people will only be buying Bitcoins either to spend them or as an investment.

How exactly is there an "entry cost"? You want some good, which is priced in Bitcoins according to its real-world currency value. You then buy however many bitcoins you need and buy it. It makes no difference to you, in this scenario, whether bitcoins cost 10 dollars or 100 dollars or 1000 dollars. I don't see what entry cost you mean.
The real issue is price stability. People don't want to use bitcoins if they're constantly going to gain or lose 20% or more of their value in a day. And this too is fixed by having a larger "market share"; the larger the market, the more confidence people have in a currency, and the smaller the swings are, relative to the price.
Also, if Bitcoin prices drop to 1¢/BTC, no one will want entry, because people will stop mining and Bitcoin will return to the status it had in 2010.

While I agree that four words is on the lighter side, security-wise, it's still plenty for a small amount of BTC, if you're not planning on using the brainwallet long-term. In addition, six words beats your 90-bit minimum, with 10^30 possibilities.
Also, color me skeptical that the full-blockchain lookup would actually improve profitability to the point that trying to bruteforce four-word brainwallets is worthwhile. Brain wallets haven't existed for that long, so I would expect that the vast majority of funded BTC addresses were generated by PRNGs. Moreover, once you get past the two- and three-word low-hanging fruit (three words takes 11.5 days to bruteforce at 1 billion guesses per second), I expect the profitability takes a massive nosedive, dropping into the negative if it wasn't there already. Are you a miner? If so, you know full well just how expensive running a GPU rig can be.
That said, I don't use a brainwallet, and my passphrase is much longer than four words, so all of this is purely an academic discussion for me. For those reading, it's never a bad idea to be more paranoid about security, so long as your security measures don't put you at risk of losing your coins (read: back up your wallets and/or write down your passphrases if you're going to be so paranoid!).

You saved the private key for this address, right? You'll need to import that into a Bitcoin client of some sort, and then you should be able to spend the coins.
Keep in mind that when you spend them, most clients will send any "change" to a new address that's within the wallet you imported to. The best way to avoid this problem is to specify where all of the funds should go, so there isn't any "change."
For example, if you have 5.5 BTC and you want to send 2.5 to Joe, 1.5 to Sue, and keep 1.5, then create yourself a new address (either by starting a wallet on a client of your choice, or by creating a fresh paper wallet) and send 2.5 to Joe's address, 1.5 to Sue's address, and 1.5 to your new address (thus spending all 5.5 BTC you had, 1.5 of which is being "spent" back to yourself). Do keep in mind that you may need to allocate a small amount to a transaction fee, or your transaction may take a while to be confirmed.

Most major operators police their pools for botnets. Not that a sophisticated operation couldn't work around that by, say, routing all the shares through one or two servers in one location, but doing so would necessarily increase the stale rate significantly.
EDIT: Also, even with workarounds like that, a close look at the actual submitted shares would catch the timestamp differences which would give away a botnet (unless it was so sophisticated as to synchronize the timestamps across the entire botnet, which is not a trivial thing to do).
And that's leaving out the fact that the article doesn't even mention ASICs once, which makes me wonder if the Bitcoin botnet "expert" even knows they exist, or if he just thinks all those ASIC owners are running botnets.

If you have access to a botnet with hundreds or thousands of nodes doing 1 GH/s each, why not just mine? Let's run this thought experiment:
Say 500 nodes at 1 GH/s for single SHA-256, so 250 GH/s for double SHA-256. At current difficulty (and using slightly pessimistic numbers), that would mine over 3.75 BTC per day.
Meanwhile, that same set of hardware can perform 500 billion guesses per second on the previously suggested four-word brainwallet. That's 500 times faster than I calculated previously, so it would take 6.34 years to bruteforce at that speed. Even if we factor in a difficulty increase of 20% per retarget for the entirety of that period (a figure whose likelihood of continuing for more than the next year I am not only skeptical of, but have already bet heavily against), that puts the mining income over that time at ~236.25 BTC. So, the brainwallet would have to contain more than that to be worth it. As points out, you can check the entire set of funded addresses on the Blockchain against each guess, but even so, you're betting a lot on the assumption that more than 236.25 BTC is stored on four-word brainwallets (and specifically those generated via a single SHA-256 hash).
EDIT: PS: Also, the minute someone with a four-word brainwallet gets his coins stolen, there will be PSAs posted on every Bitcoin community site about it, and people will up the ante on their security. So I wouldn't expect that this attack would break more than one or two brainwallets before falling completely apart.

Care to point out a fallacy there? Day trading is gambling, and there is nothing you can say to change that. Unless you know what the price will do, which no legitimate trader does, you cannot win at day trading. 
You summarize my suggestion as losing "10-15k," which implies that you know what will happen. I'd like to know what fallacy I'm guilty of there. 
And you're saying that he would be only $3900 short of recouping his costs by this time next year, which means that by six months after that, he will almost certainly have passed the break-even point. This holds true if he sells his BTC at an average price of $100, no matter how long he holds them.
Then there's this completely untrue claim:


That's not at all "known." Again, you're assuming you know the future. If Bitcoin becomes widely-used, it will tend to rise in price over time, as you say, but there is no guarantee of that at this juncture. If ECDSA or SHA256 is broken, or an infinitely superior cryptocurrency is developed, Bitcoins will be worthless.

EDIT: Brace yourself. Seriously cantankerous response below.
I fucking hate haikus. Real Japanese-language Haikus are one thing, but garbage English ones are complete crap because any idiot can write one. You want a challenging poetic form? Here's one:
    A jaded lout
    who's fading out
    will bray and shout
    and pray devout
    --not face his doubts.
    But maybe now
    the way they tout
    will cave somehow.
Another example:
    Our artistry
    is heartily
    apart from the
    soul-dark'ning greed--
    that chart that we
    work hard to keep
    of our money
    kills harmony.
The format is iambic diameter (biameter? I'm not sure what the correct term is), with each line rhyming or near-rhyming with each other line in the last three syllables.

There is no such thing as a "safe store of cash." Under the mattress risks theft and inflation. US Treasuries risk perhaps not beating inflation, as well as the possibility that the US could default on its debts (which it won't do unless certain moronic congresspeople force it to, but that's not an impossibility). Savings accounts risk losing to inflation, as well as the possibility of FDIC default (again, extremely unlikely but not impossible). The word "investment" in my description of Treasuries implies that there is, in fact, risk, because there is *no such thing as a risk-free investment*, and there shouldn't be. No one should be rewarded for doing nothing at all.

This is not a request for discussion. This is an attempt to spark a debate, and all it will accomplish is a libertarian circle-jerk.
If you wanted to have a discussion, you wouldn't have prefaced it by asserting your own viewpoint. You're not just asking a question here; you're implicitly attacking the viewpoints you claim to want to engage.
What evidence do you have that Bitcoin undermines the functions of government on a large scale? Sure, it allows small-timers to skate under the radar--small-time drug dealers/users on SR, small-time traders, small-time business owners, etc. But these people already have something that enables this; it's called cash and, surprise, surprise, the government itself is producing and distributing it.
What the regulators are trying to do, and what they will stop at nothing to accomplish, is preventing big-time actors from hiding from the tax man. Anyone who tries to get in their way on this will pay dearly for it, likely by way of years of his/her life spent imprisoned. If the government were to lose this fight, they would have reason to try to crush Bitcoin (and they could; remember that the entire Bitcoin economy is less than a fraction of a percent of the federal budget). But they are not going to lose, and hence they will have no reason to work against Bitcoin once they have the exchanges under tight AML control.
Now, you guys think taxes amount to theft. I think not paying taxes amounts to theft. If you employ workers that went to public schools, if you received a federally-insured student or housing loan, if you sell things to seniors or poor people who receive government benefits, if you drive on roads, if you take air travel, if you've ever been assisted by the police or fire department, if you use electricity, or running water, or sewer, or the Internet, hell if you even breathe air or drink water that isn't full of toxic pollutants, you are taking advantage of services provided for by taxation. If you don't like it, go build your own society--don't fuck mine up.

It would behoove you to recognize that regulation is not the cause of all economic problems. The real reason car companies take a long time to make a profit is the sheer scale involved in the automobile business. In order to mass-produce a modern vehicle, you need hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of tooling and factory space, to say nothing of the huge investment in engineering such a vehicle and doing the dizzying array of tests required to ensure its functionality and safety in all conceivable conditions and situations. You can't recoup that quickly.

More importantly, why would Satoshi dump all of his coins on the market at once and destroy his own fortune? And to confront the article's suggestion, why in god's name would he want to destroy the elegant and sophisticated system into which he put so much thought and effort?
Besides which, if Satoshi tries to cash out now, people will figure out who he is, and I really don't think he wants anyone to know who he is (given the precautions he took to prevent that in the first place), so I have my doubts that any of those coins will ever move until he dies and gives the coins to his heir(s). (Unless he's already lost or destroyed the keys, or does so in the future, which is also entirely possible.)

I don't know where you're from, but around here, most people don't have much of any money.
And yes, the Worgl experiment enjoyed a situation to which it was uniquely suited. But I still think that if someone is willing to get it started by backing a demurrage currency with "real" money (for Freicoin, that would mean someone offering to buy Freicoins for Bitcoins at some pre-decided exchange rate), in order to give the demurrage currency real value, you can get something similar going even today.
Once a demurrage currency has real value, there's no reason not to accept it; people will want to spend it, and as long as a merchant can use it quickly, it will be worth accepting. And once a demurrage currency is usable, it will begin to move far faster than any other form of money, hence promoting economic growth and ensuring that the economy actually works the way it's supposed to. It takes power away from those who hold capital and puts it into the hands of those who do labor, because those who do labor are able to accept money from people (thus sparing them the cost of demurrage), and then spend basically all of that money, which protects them (the laborers) from demurrage losses.
In other words, a demurrage currency forces the use of money for either consumption or investment as soon as possible, without the problematic issue of paying back an ever-increasing supply of debt.
The thing about the Worgl experiment is that it's very easy to make claims about how it would or wouldn't work in today's world, largely because it was shut down by the Austrian Central Bank, so there's no way to know how it would work today.
Now, admittedly, I'm not mining Freicoin right now--but that's because it's not profitable given the current exchange rate (I don't believe in mining unprofitably for speculative reasons), not because of the demurrage. And once the Freicoin foundation gets going, perhaps I'll apply for a grant.

It's very easy to say, in today's world, that people in remote areas should have to pay egregious sums to send mail, or have mail sent to them (assuming there's sufficient volume of mail in the region to justify continued presence in the region at all, something a private firm would be constantly examining), but until very recently, the mail was the *only* way to communicate over very long distances, and until far *more* recently, it was the only inexpensive way to do so. As such, people tended to see mail service as more of a human right, and until fairly recently, no private firm was large enough or organized enough to be capable of distributing mail as widely and quickly as the postal service did.
Anyway, we don't pay huge subsidies to the Post Office. We pay for those costs with the price of postage, which, at less than 50 cents to send a letter anywhere in the country, really isn't bad at all. The primary problem with the Post Office is the fact that it's required by law to prefund its retirement obligations to a ludicrous degree.

The **Euro** is "losing the ugly contest" because it has strengthened recently on forex markets?! This guy is a moron. The eurozone is still in the toilet, and a stronger euro only hurts european exports (read: hurts Germany, the only pretty-much-functional economy left in Europe). Meanwhile, no one is seeing any inflation to speak of, and the US economy is doing far better than the Eurozone's, even after the shutdown mess.
People often assume that the price of a currency on forex markets matters to ordinary people. It doesn't; it only matters to importers and exporters. Inflation is what matters to most people, and it's been well below-target in both the US and in Europe.

I won't give out many details here, but although my coins are better-protected than those belonging to an average security-unaware user, my security efforts have hardly been super-human. My wallet files are all encrypted with strong passwords, and there is one other significant security measure involved, but that's about the full extent of it. I don't use TrueCrypt or other encryption (besides what Bitcoin-QT provides), but I do keep multiple backups of my wallets.
That said, the computer I use for all of this is not in great shape (I think my HDD may fail soon), so I'm planning to buy a new hard drive and significantly rework my security in the near future. The rash of thefts lately has me scared, especially given that several of the recent victims were much more security-conscious about their Bitcoins than I am.

Don't listen to most of these people here. A 1-year ROI is actually very good, especially considering that BFL products have a lifetime warranty and the next halving won't be for another 3+ years. I don't believe BFL is a scam. I think they're a company that is having delays, just like they did before. Back then everyone was calling it a scam, and they ultimately shipped a product that was satisfactory to 90+% of those who pre-ordered. Some ask why they don't just mine bitcoins themselves. What those people aren't getting is that BFL, like the general stores that sold picks and shovels and explosives to the miners in the gold rush, stands to make the more money selling hardware than miners will make mining bitcoins. And for those wondering why the difficulty is spiking, that's because ASICMINER and Avalon customers are mining now (see bitcointalk.org forums for more info)
Now, don't expect to be rolling in coins, though. It will take some time to make back your $150 (if the difficulty has risen to about 200 million, it might be as much as 500 days at $30/BTC, even, and that doesn't account for power or shipping costs, or any rise in difficulty beyond that), but if you make back your initial investment within two years and have another year of mining, that's a roughly 50% return on your money (IE you get back 150% of what you spent).

I don't feel that you effectively contradicted my point about violence being a matter of degree. Unless you think it's possible to inflict the same level of psychological pain via a forum comment as results from seeing the worst moments of one's life broadcast to strangers who are on the side of your tormentor (and I don't see how that's even remotely possible, as I said earlier), the two cannot be lumped together just because they have some similarities.
Do you really think that? If so, all I can say is that I don't think you fully understand the depth of the emotions that get involved here.


This is a philosophical argument. I don't think there's any gain here; at this point we're just arguing over definitions. And yes, definitions can be important (see, for example, the definition of terrorism--one man's terrorist is another's freedom fighter--or soldier), but in this case I think justice would be better served by trying to hinder these people rather than trying to decide if we consider them "violent."

These are schools like the University of Phoenix and others, which prey on adults who would like to go back to school but don't have much experience with institutional education. They take these people and convince them to borrow huge amounts of money (from private lenders rather than the cheaper federally-insured programs, because the private lenders pay the school a kickback) to pay for the "education" the school provides, which is all too often a garbage degree that won't be taken seriously by employers.

The whole block time thing has nothing to do with security; that's a [red herring]( A transaction's level of security from a double-spend is a function of network hashing power times countable time units (blocks). So, let's assume that the Bitcoin network has 150 TH/s and the Litecoin network has 15 GH/s (it's actually about 19, but 15 simplifies the calculation), which is roughly equivalent to 15 TH/s for SHA-256.
That means that after the same amount of time (as measured in blocks, so after 10 minutes or 4 LTC blocks or 1 BTC block, say), a Bitcoin transaction is 10 times as secure as a Litecoin transaction, due to the 10x greater level of hashing power on the Bitcoin network over Litecoin. Now, Litecoin transactions are more secure from double-spends for the first 3 blocks (7.5 minutes), at which point a Bitcoin transaction will still be unconfirmed. But after the first Bitcoin confirmation hits, the Litecoin transaction can never catch up.
The progression is:
    BTC Confirmations:
    0 -&gt;    0   -&gt;    0   -&gt;   0  -&gt;    1   -&gt;   1  -&gt;   1   -&gt;  1   -&gt;  2...
    BTC Security (SHA-256 TH):
    0 -&gt;    0   -&gt;    0   -&gt;   0  -&gt;   90k  -&gt; 90k  -&gt;  90k  -&gt; 90k  -&gt; 180k...
    LTC Confirmations:
    0 -&gt;    1   -&gt;    2   -&gt;   3  -&gt;    4   -&gt;   5  -&gt;   6   -&gt;  7   -&gt;  8....
    LTC Security (SHA-256 TH equiv):
    0 -&gt; 2250   -&gt;   4.5k -&gt; 6750 -&gt;   9k   -&gt; ~11k -&gt; 13.5k -&gt; ~16k -&gt; 18k...

Anyone want to talk about the serious policy question raised in the article? Here it is:


Now, I'm no economist, but it seems to me that if someone is dumping huge amounts of a particular fiat currency onto the market (in exchange for BTC), the central bank for that currency can simply pull an equivalent amount of that currency out of the system using whatever reserves it has in currencies other than its own. So long as the size of the central bank's reserve is sufficient to absorb the excess currency dumped onto the market by the speculative attack, the exchange rate between the fiat currency in question and BTC will adjust relatively quickly as arbitrageurs move money around.
Or am I missing something? Are there any dismal scientists out there who can weigh in on this?

The concept of inflation is that every number rises, not just prices. Salaries and wages are also expected to rise during times of inflation, so most people could reasonably expect their income to keep up with inflation.
Now, it doesn't always work out quite so neatly--there's usually a time-lag involved between prices rising and incomes rising. But during a period of sustained inflation, wages should rise too. Sadly, that's not what's been happening lately, but I'd put that at Wall Street's doorstep, not the Fed's, because Wall St has been pushing companies to make ever-greater quarterly profits for over 30 years now, which has led them to squeeze the little guy until he can barely breathe.

Well, to go down the list:
1. Guns: Libertarians want to have guns so they can "fight the government" or whatever. I don't believe that an armed insurrection against the US government would either a) be successful, or b) achieve a positive result if it *was* successful. As such, I see guns as taking innocent lives while offering minimal to no benefit to society at large. Note that those who own guns are far more likely to shoot themselves or a family member with them than they are to successfully use them to defend against an intruder/attacker. Note that although I do feel this way, and strongly, I don't believe we should ban all guns, or even assault weapons. In order of likelihood to pass, I support universal background checks, a database of registered firearms (because it would allow law enforcement to verify that those buying huge stockpiles of guns *kept* those stockpiles rather than reselling them to criminals), and a handgun ban (because handguns serve no purpose other than killing people, small populations of handgun hunters notwithstanding).
2. Taxation: Without taxation, governments are incapable of providing things like roads, bridges, FEMA, the FDA, police forces, firefighters, free public education...the list goes on and on. No, the government doesn't use all of its money for good things, but the majority of tax dollars are spent on Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. Libertarians may not like those programs, but a majority of Americans do, and strongly.
3. Deficits/Debt: These are bad when the economy *isn't* in the shitter. But it still is. So we shouldn't be worrying about them right now, because it's keeping the economy in the shitter, and people out of jobs.
4. Spending: The other side of the deficit/debt coin. If the government doesn't spend, and corporations don't spend, then how can anyone else afford to spend? And that's why the economy is still in the shitter.
Now, I'm going to go ahead and guess that you disagree with almost everything I just said. Let's not get into that argument, because it's not going to be any fun for either of us. The purpose of the above is to explain to you what my thinking is on these issues, and perhaps illuminate why it is that I'm not a libertarian.

Huh? If he bought in June 2012, the best he'd have done would be ~$5.20/BTC. At $183 (price plus standard shipping), that's ~35.19 BTC, or ~$4200 today. At a difficulty of 15M, he can expect a ~222 day ROI. So, he could potentially see break-even before the next halving, although it seems somewhat unlikely. Regardless, your math is *way off*.

Given that the Avalon systems are designed to be pointed at a pool (or solo-mining node), and are not capable of solo mining on their own, protocol-level issues make no difference at all.
And a bug like your target issue would, first of all, not crop up in ordinary pooled mining, which uses low values for the target anyway, and second of all, would be found in the design of the chip (and hence show up in every chip produced, not just some of them), so you wouldn't need to test all of your chips for such a thing, just one of them.

What did it say about why you were disabled (if anything)? Are you located in the United States? If so, was that fact referenced?
This is of interest to me because betcoin.tm is supposedly one arm of the investment strategy of one Massive Luck Investments, which claims to have invested a significant sum of money into Avalon-clone-builder BitMine.ch for the purpose of having 4 PH/s of hashing power built and hashing by March. They are supposedly a Hong Kong-based investment company whose principals helped fund Skype and which has offices all over the world, according to [the press release](
Now, given that I'm a miner myself, and given the impact 4 PH/s would have on the network, I found myself concerned, so I did a search on Massive Luck Investments. I found a [whois record for massiveluck.com]( which is registered by some whois privacy service, and which redirects (slowly) to  a site which claims to represent "Five Flag Holdings LTD," and which has only a landing page with a description of the firm's business ("strategic metals," which roughly aligns with that of "Massive Luck's" business [as reported by CoinDesk]( mining metals, in particular precious metals and rare earth metals) and [a "contact us" page]( with an email, a phone number, and a physical address (more on that below). Five Flag Holdings LTD was founded in 2012, according to [records I found online]( I also found a [whois record for betcoin.tm]( which lists the same address as the Five Flag Holdings contact page, and which does say it is owned by "Massive Luck." BitMine.ch themselves do mention the investment, [saying on Aug 6th, 2013]( that they expect to see a very large investment thanks to Massive Luck. Aside from those references to the company, however, the only other mentions online that I can find are [one from a bitcointalk.org user]( saying much the same as I am, and copies of the press release (or news articles quoting it), except for [one article about Bitcoin online gambling]( which characterizes the executive from betcoin it quotes as "PR-shy."
However, I also found [a company, Lewis PR, that lists as its address one of the same suites]( that supposedly houses "Massive Luck Investments." EDIT: [At least one other company]( is apparently housed in Suite 1. If someone wants to call either of them up and ask them if they have heard of their supposed neighbors Massive Luck Investments, that would be awesome.
EDIT2: The plot thickens! The phone number listed on the "Five Flag Holdings LTD" page is, curiously enough, the same number as is listed as a contact number [here]( by one Fortune Leap International, Limited (which, even more curiously, is involved in mining rare earth metals, just as "Massive Luck Investments" supposedly is!).
I'm skeptical of this firm and anything it's involved with, and for obvious reasons, I'd very much like to discover that it's all just a bunch of bullshit. I'd appreciate any good information anyone can provide on this subject.

Funny you should mention this. I don't know what the situation is like in Europe, but my family owns rental property in an American inner city neighborhood, and one thing I've been struck by is the fact that virtually none of the tenants we've had have had bank accounts. The reality is that huge numbers of people in the first world have no bank accounts, and they pay for it in a variety of ways, from egregious check-cashing fees, to the fees on those pre-paid debit cards, to fees for money orders, to simply being robbed of cash. And these are the people in our society who can *least* afford such expenses.
I'm not sure Bitcoin is the answer for these people (at least, not as it stands today--I would think they would make very easy targets for hackers and malware, personally), but this is a lot more of a problem than Wall Street types in suits, who drive fancy cars from their gated communities to get to their offices in skyscrapers, would have you believe (probably because they have no goddamn clue how real people live).

Personally, I think those estimates are crazy. That 128 years assumes a perpetual 25 BTC per block, which will be cut in half in 3 years, and then halved again four years later, etc etc. Even 10 years is far too long (it encompasses two halvings). No one in Bitcoin-Land seems to be OK with a break-even time of more than 2 years, it seems, and I don't see that changing until the Bitcoin system is far more entrenched and mainstream than it is today.
The only way I can see that kind of hashing power being added to the network is if the value of Bitcoins increases 25 to 100 fold, which would completely rewrite the profitability equation.

If the deflation kills Bitcoin, there is an obvious solution: a Bitcoin fork that doesn't reduce the block rewards over time. Such a fork would not have a limited number of total coins, but would have a steady, predictable inflation rate that would prevent any problems that may arise from Bitcoin's deflationary nature.
It's ultimately an experiment, and it may fail. But if it does, something else will surely replace it, because the basic idea of Bitcoin is too useful and too important to give up on.

Roadmaps are written by the manager in charge of a project. Bitcoin has no "manager in charge." Hence, no roadmap.
I am concerned about the 32-bit timestamps, but like the [blockchain fork on March 11th]( this can be fixed in a relatively straightforward manner though what might be termed the "miner's democracy," in which everyone has as much voting power as they have hashing power.
As for point 1, you can use lightweight clients which don't maintain a copy of the blockchain like the standard client does (Electrum has been suggested but it's not the only lightweight client out there).

I know very little about this subject, so hopefully someone more knowledgeable can come in and correct any errors I make here, but my guess is that in order to buy BTC through an IRA, the person or company managing the IRA account would have to purchase and control the Bitcoins--I don't expect it would be kosher for you to buy and control them yourself, seeing as that seems much more like traditional securities ownership than ownership-via-IRA.

Part of the problem is that deflation really is a bad thing for a nation-state's fiat currency, many of the reasons for which have to do with the types of economic conditions that tend to cause it (namely, severe recessions, aka depressions). Bitcoin is tied to no nation-state (and hence, is forced on no population), and its deflationary nature rears its head during times of growth in the Bitcoin economy. As such, Bitcoin defies many of the fundamental assumptions that underpin modern economics, and I think it's because they don't realize this that most economists today dismiss it (unless, of course, they happen to think that most modern economists are completely wrong about everything, as the Austrians do--hence the massive libertarian bias on this subreddit and elsewhere in the Bitcoin community).
@_date: 2013-08-02 14:38:14
Most economic thought regards deflation as bad, full stop. Note that the person who said that is a computer science professor, not an economist.
Note also that it takes a fair amount of grounding in knowledge about Bitcoin to even consider ways in which the differences between Bitcoin and fiat currency might change the effects of deflation--and that not everyone who has such a grounding is in agreement that deflation is OK for Bitcoin.
Myself, I tend to think (or perhaps more accurately, I tend to hope) that deflation will not become a major problem for Bitcoin. However, this view is based on the assumption that Bitcoin will remain a "currency adapter" for Internet commerce rather than becoming a widely-used currency in its own right. Precisely *because* of the deflation issue, I don't think Bitcoin is likely to work well as a currency on its own. (Think about it: is there anything you'd be willing to put a long-term fixed Bitcoin price on, which isn't either a Bitcoin mining device or a physical Bitcoin? I can't think of anything.)

Good question; as an armchair economist, I'm probably not the person to ask. My understanding is that central banks target a rate of 3% annual inflation, but cryptocurrencies are wonderful as economic experiments, so I see no reason why we couldn't try out different rates, which could be either constant (e.g., 50 per block forever) or percentage-based (as in the 3% annual rate target).
As for what happens when the economy ends up at +/- 0 for multiple years running, remember that it's +/- 0 off of the preset inflation rate, which means that the economy is growing. So, my assumption is that prosperity happens.

I think you're all missing the point because everyone is focused on their own ideological positions regarding inflation vs deflation. The crux of the argument in the article is actually primarily in chart 2, which is where it falls completely flat.
Look at that chart. For one, it shows that nearly 1% of the entire Bitcoin market cap changes hands *on a* ***bad*** *day*. I'm no economist, but that sounds like incredible velocity to me. Still, that's not the real argument-killer here.
The worst part of the argument? The complete failure to draw any connection between charts 1 and 2. If you do, keeping in mind that chart 2 is merely a relative measure against the total Bitcoin market cap, which has risen sharply throughout the time period the chart shows, it becomes clear that people are using the Bitcoin network to transmit far more value now than they were previously.
In addition, notice where the spikes occur in chart 2: at the points where the value soared its fastest (early April and late November 2013). This would tend to suggest that, rather than viewing price surges as natural and expected deflation, Bitcoiners are jumping to cash out when the price climbs especially fast.
In other words, economics is no more of a science than political "science," and people need to stop acting like knowing about some guy's stupid, incorrect model gives them the ability to predict what will happen in the world. (Note that I am making a blanket statement that applies across economic ideologies here; neither side of most major economics debates is innocent on this count.)

Difficulty will not rise past the break-even point for most miners. It *can't* (for very long, anyway) by dint of the economic forces built into the system.
Moreover, an extended exponential rise eventually gets you to a point where all of the materials on Earth are being used to mine Bitcoins, which is patently absurd. The exponential rise *has* to stop somewhere; it *literally cannot* continue unabated forever.

The final paragraph of the article reads:


So no, he doesn't think it's only good for storing money. He, like me, thinks that Bitcoin is not going to replace or threaten fiat currency while at the same time acknowledging its innovative nature and its potential for disruption of an existing industry. (I personally see a *lot* more potential, but it takes an in-depth understanding of Bitcoin to fully understand how truly powerful the technology is, so I hardly expect the average journalist to fully get that.)
Just because your ideology leads you to believe a different economic doctrine (a discussion of whose relative merits I'd like to avoid) doesn't mean that those who espouse a different economic doctrine are simply morons. You'll never win people over to your viewpoint making arguments in those terms.

Zerocoin was designed to work on top of the existing Bitcoin system. I'm not sure at the moment if it can be added with no changes to the current protocol or if it would require some tweaking of the protocol (although I think it's the former), but there's no reason that Bitcoin can't implement Zerocoin too. If an altcoin gets popular thanks to a Zerocoin implementation, I would expect to see Zerocoin functionality added to Bitcoin in short order.

1. AES256 is not used in Bitcoin or Litecoin. It is frequently used to encrypt stored wallets, but is not a part of the protocol.
2. Bitcoin and Litecoin both use the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm to sign transactions and validate signatures. This is an entirely different algorithm from the hash algorithms used to secure the respective blockchains (SHA256 for Bitcoin, Scrypt for Litecoin).
3. Mining hardware does not *break* any kind of cryptographic algorithm. It is designed for what is known as a brute-force search, looking for a validly formatted input to the hash algorithm that produces a number sufficiently low to qualify as a block.
That said, quantum computers *will* one day be good enough to break ECDSA, at which point both Bitcoin and Litecoin (assuming they're both still used) will need to switch signature algorithms. This would be a complicated task, but not impossible. Note that if an address has yet to be used to spend, then the public key has never been revealed, making that address still safe from being broken by a quantum computer. As such, it will still be possible to keep funds secure during the transition from one signature algorithm to another.
Also, 1 billion billion years is an infinitesimal amount of time compared to the time it would take to *count* to 2^256 (which would be required to brute-force an AES-256 key), let alone actually check each value to see if it is the sought-after key.

@_date: 2013-12-18 19:34:09
This is completely untrue. Bitcoin uses ECDSA, or Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm, which does not involve factoring or prime numbers at all (you're thinking of RSA, which has nothing to do with ECDSA). However, if SHA-256 or elliptic curve cryptography (on whose security which ECDSA relies) were to be broken, numerous applications which rely on one or both of them would fail.

Again, miners do **not** issue Bitcoins. The network/protocol does that; miners are merely being rewarded for maintaining the network.
As for having "authority to redeem," no miner can ever remove Bitcoins from circulation (except insofar as he or she can hoard those he/she owns--but these still exist, and so are technically still "in circulation"). In fact, the number of Bitcoins in existence can never decrease; only the number of *accessible* Bitcoins can go down.

Most of this is degenerating into "Libertarianism is right!" "No it's not!" Given that I do not wish to continue that argument *ad nauseum*, I will leave most of it alone.
However, I just couldn't let the following slide:


You are not poor. Low-income is not the same as poor. If you were poor, you would not be saving anything, because you wouldn't have enough to pay the bills. You would be poor on a $20k income if you had dependents, but you clearly don't, or you wouldn't have savings. (Oh, and if you're receiving government benefits, we should subtract those out of your savings, since you clearly don't believe such benefits should exist).
Every day, a poor person makes choices such as:
- Should I pay the electric bill, or the gas bill? I can't pay both. (Answer: You pay the one that will cut off service soonest.)
- Should I buy food for myself with these pennies, or gasoline? (Answer: Always gasoline. Otherwise how can you get to work?)
- Who do I stiff so I can get my car repaired? (Answer: Whoever will punish you the least.)
- Now that the water company just cut off the water, which of my kids' names do I put the bill under? (Yes, this really happens.)
- At the grocery store: Which food has the absolute lowest cost per meal (regardless of how appealing it is)?
If you aren't constantly making decisions like that, you're not poor. By the way, for the [federal government to consider you officially "in poverty,"]( you would need to have 4 people in your household and still not make more than $21k.
You are far more privileged than you think you are.
Source on life in poverty: Real-world experience. I've experienced being poor, drowning in debt, always wondering how I could possibly make the next payment, or buy food, or gas, or pay rent or the electric bill. I was lucky; I managed to get out thanks to my parents' support, [deus ex machina]( style, and get back into school. Most people aren't so fortunate. (The putting-bills-in-kids'-names thing is sourced from a friend of mine who grew up in poverty, whose mother had put bills under his name when he was a kid).

As you've already stated, even those who are tech-savvy can have Bitcoin stolen. I honestly don't see that there's a very large difference between a tech-savvy Bitcoin user and one who isn't tech-savvy in terms of theft risk.
No, people who aren't tech-savvy shouldn't keep large quantities of Bitcoins. No, nobody, regardless of how tech-savvy they are, should feel that his or her Bitcoins are competely secure, ever.
But the idea that people who aren't tech-savvy shouldn't even *use* Bitcoin is ridiculous. Yes, there are risks involved, and you should make it clear to them that any computer virus they get could steal their Bitcoins, and that they need to be paranoid about their wallet file and keep their software updated. But this is not too much to ask (and if Bitcoin spurs the general population to maintain better computer security, so much the better!). Grandma doesn't even use a computer, let alone email or BitTorrent or Bitcoin. The rest of us, even if we don't keep apprised of the latest zero-days (which, for the record, I do) can still use Bitcoins even if we can't be certain that they're secure. It's just a matter of knowing how much of a risk is acceptable, and keeping your exposure at or below that level.

Do you actually read Krugman? He wants a bill to create jobs by spending more money, because borrowing costs are and have been at record lows for the United States, and our infrastructure is crumbling and outdated.
The much-maligned stimulus bill did a great deal to keep the country's recession from worsening, including a great deal of investment in rail, modernizing the electric grid, repairing crumbling bridges, clean energy, and a massive investment in education that went largely unnoticed. And to top it all off, the bill provided a significant tax cut for every American (remember, roughly a *third* of the cost of the stimulus bill was in tax cuts). In addition to all of this, the federal government provided a huge amount of money to the states, who badly needed it to cover expenses they would otherwise have had to cut (though to be fair, much of the education funding probably went here).
Now, you can argue it didn't work. But the economy is slowly, haltingly improving, and by the simple Keynesian "engine" analogy, it can be easily argued the problem was that the kickstart wasn't powerful enough. At least, that's what Krugman argued at the time that it was being debated--that the stimulus wasn't big enough; that it should have been bigger.
Now, you can disagree with the theory, but by Keynesian theory, again, a bigger stimulus would have kickstarted the private sector into spending money again and tax revenues would have picked up, helping to pay off the debt incurred even as its size relative to GDP decreased.
Personally, as a young person, I worry that my elders are too focused on reducing debt in government because they believe a government should operate like a household, when in fact the greater danger is that the country will be ill-equipped to compete in the 21st century, as our roads crumble, our over-centralized and fossil-fuel-dependent electric grid, lack of efficient transportation, and oligopolistic broadband and wireless markets undermine our economy going into the future.

OK, you clearly have a good handle on all of this, sorry to question that. Yes, variance is *generally* lower in a bigger pool, simply by dint of the sheer number of blocks the pool is mining, but a large pool can still have significant variance, and hence bad luck, and there's no guarantee beyond the laws of probability to prevent the bad luck from continuing for some time.
The whole point here is that PPS pools *do not have any variance in payout*. That's how this debate got started. You cannot tell me that a miner on a large PPLNS pool is safer from bad luck than a miner on a small PPS pool (except insofar as bad luck can kill the small PPS pool, as happened with Mtred).
I'll grant that now that Mtred is gone, p2pool is probably the best option out there. But I'm not 100% sure of that, because bad luck doesn't always get balanced out by good luck in the end, in Bitcoin, no matter the laws of probability. Why? Because difficulty trends generally *upward*, and very rarely downward. So the good luck later, which would ordinarily cancel out earlier bad luck, is often at a higher difficulty, meaning that a little bad luck early takes a *lot* of good luck later on to balance out.

I'm a software engineer, but I only started last August; before that I was still in school studying computer science and biochemistry. Incidentally, the resume that got me the job included my experience having "built and administered an approximately 8 Tflops Linux system which sold GPU computing power to the Bitcoin network (also known as 'mining' Bitcoins, an online crypto-currency)."
In June of 2011, while I was doing an internship at school, a friend of mine showed me the Silk Road. Having never encountered Tor before then, I was at first shocked that such a website could exist, and insisted it was a scam. That led to my asking how people paid each other on SR, which of course led to Bitcoins. I remember being skeptical of the whole thing, but after my friend had left that day, I hopped onto the Bitcoin wiki and started reading, and that led me to...mining!
Now, at first I was searching for a catch, because it just didn't make sense that I could build a computer that would then pay for itself. But I kept reading, and didn't find one, and at that point I guess I had come to know what drove so many young men to cross the country in 1849.

I don't understand what you're saying. I was under the impression that you were suggesting that blockchains could be used to organize societies. I was asking you how you can avoid having a situation where anyone who dislikes any tiny aspect of a society can just fork the society, which in my view would tend to lead toward chaos as people created their own societies to suit their own personal moral choices.
By the way, I actually don't think "evil" exists. I think selfishness and bitterness and prejudice and greed  and nationalism/ethnocentrism and many other unpleasant things exist, but I know better than to try to categorize them as purely black and white, and I also know that attempting to do so often results in what those who do it would call "evil." (At risk of violating Godwin's Law, Hitler and the Nazis are a good example--they felt that Jews were evil, so they sought to eradicate them, and in so doing perpetrated one of the greatest crimes the world has ever known.)

Yeah, you'll have to do a lot of explaining about how Bitcoin works, but in the end, you have completely undeniable proof. I'd talk to a lawyer about how to proceed; I can't tell you what the best course of action is. Depending on what your lawyer says, you might want to consider filing a police report (but get the lawyer's go-ahead first!).

You do realize that Social Security numbers are far more important, and that having your identity stolen can destroy your credit history and lose you all of your money, right?
Sure, credit cards are insured, but your life isn't. And if someone is using *your* identity, then the transaction most certainly *is* anonymous!
Oh, and the "losses within acceptable bounds"? Those losses are tens of times greater than the entire market cap of Bitcoin, every year.
As for the post you linked, that guy was using a vulnerable Android app on a rooted phone, so the mystery is likely solved at this point.
I am well aware that ordinary people are not security-conscious enough to be perfectly safe using Bitcoins, but that doesn't mean they can't put $100 into a wallet. Until there *are* trusted third parties in the Bitcoin world, it's foolish for the non-tech-savvy to buy large quantities of Bitcoins (160 BTC is definitely too many), but the possibility of losing $100 to a hack is no worse and ultimately no different than the same amount lost to a mugging, something to which an ordinary person is just as vulnerable.

Difficulty = (TotalHashrate * 600) / 2^32
(where TotalHashrate is the total network hashrate in hashes per second)
Difficulty1SharesPerDay = (Hashrate * 86400) / 2^32
(where hashrate is your hashrate in hashes per second)
AvgBitcoinsPerDay = (Difficulty1SharesPerDay / Difficulty) * (25 * (1 - fee))
(where fee is the pool fee, expressed as a decimal, e.g. 3% would be 0.03)
So, if you know your Difficulty1SharesPerDay value and your pool's fee, all you need is the difficulty to calculate mining income.

I'd like to point out that if the merchant is accepting Bitcoins via Bitpay or a similar service, those coins will usually be sold shortly after you spend them, so there's a sell no matter what you do, pretty much.

2 things:
1. The rate at which Bitcoin mining ASICs are produced is limited by the production capacity of the companies in the business of producing them.
2. No one is going to buy a miner just so they can break even on power costs. That would be moronic.

Litecoin is the most profitable, but if you're stuck with sha256, PPCoin and TerraCoin are both profitable right now too. Novacoin is a little more questionable because there are a lot of premined coins still out there. In general though, you can't really go wrong if you transfer into Bitcoins immediately (unless BTC/fiat exchange rates drop, or the altcoins soar in value).
@_date: 2013-04-02 17:09:03
I've been thinking about this too. I remember reading a while back that one of the ideas for saving newspapers/journalism in the digital age would be micropayments, usually advocated as being on a per-article basis. Prior to Bitcoin, it was impossible to pay 1/10th of a cent per article, unless you kept a tally and charged people once they had built up a large enough balance. Now that you can really make and accept micropayments easily, this model actually has a chance at being tried out, which I think is really cool!

Wow, the pseudoscience level is off the charts...
So, they use their liquid nitrogen to create superconductivity, do they? Funny, I wasn't aware of any high-temperature-superconductive forms of silicon having ever been discovered. Running a 1 TH/s ASIC miner and a nitrogen condensor for only 2800W seems like a piddly accomplishment next to that.

I guarantee you that if I paid off my student loans in full tomorrow, the IRS would hear about it, and they'd be expecting to see a whole lot more income listed on my return than usual, and a commensurately greater amount of tax paid. And they'd also expect me to explain how I got it.
As such, I keep a spreadsheet of all my Bitcoin income and expenses, and I intend to pay my taxes, so that if I do find myself flush with Bitcoin wealth, I can use it for legitimate things, like starting a business (something I hope to do in the future).

Good point. But the protocol interprets a decimal point eight places to the left of where it is when representing integer satoshis. My point is that there's no need to make a protocol-level change when the client already supports the use of smaller units.

People here seem to hate mining with a passion. Trust me, it's worth it. At current difficulty, with $100/BTC and power costs of $0.35/kWh (an absurdly high rate for US residents), it'd take 24 days to pay for itself. If you factor a 25% difficulty increase per retarget into that, it still only takes 44 days to break even.

So, if I'm mining, and Bob sends Bitcoins to Alice's address, and I take the transaction and include it in my block, you think I've accepted virtual currency? That makes no sense. At no time during the process am I ever in control of any kind of value that is being transferred. The network, upon accepting my block, clears the transaction and transfers control of the coins to Alice, without my ever having had the ability to, say, decide that Alice is scamming Bob and return his coins to him.

You know, it's ironic, but I think that one of the greatest strengths Bitcoin has is also the reason that the rational discussion you crave is so difficult to have here: it makes people fall in love with it.
Think about it: do people get *this* fervent about a stock or other investment? What about a payment system--when was the last time you heard of someone evangelizing Paypal or Square? Bitcoin exerts some kind of pull on people. I don't know what it is, but I'm sure just about everyone here can understand what I'm talking about (even if they think Bitcoin is doomed).
It's that energy and enthusiasm that keeps me bullish on Bitcoin's prospects. This community is constantly working to improve both the protocol itself and the ecosystem surrounding it. This is the reason I kept faith in Bitcoin even as it was at its low point in late 2011.
Will it become the dominant global currency? I doubt it. Will it even become the primary form of payment online? I'm not sure. But I am confident that Bitcoin will be used in a variety of ways (remittances, evading currency controls, and escaping hyperinflation being big ones in the nearer term, and then things like using the blockchain as an asset registry later on) which will preserve its value and relevance.
I'll be honest, my biggest concern is that before Bitcoin can break through to a majority of users in the first world, where I don't see that it has many strong use cases, the US government creates its own cryptocurrency. While this might create interesting possibilities (mining US cryptodollars, anyone?), it also represents a real threat to Bitcoin. That said, people like Mercedes Kelley Tunstall actually give me hope, because their failure to see the power of the Bitcoin system--which failure seems to stem from Bitcoin's apparently freewheeling, anti-establishment character--and the degree of input such people have in top-level decision making, together suggest that such an event is unlikely to occur.

Actually, the Worgl experiment relied not on a decree but on a backing by what you might call "real money." This is Freicoin's problem; without someone backing up the value initially, people have no incentive to seek out Freicoin (or to mine it). Were I to set up such a cryptocurrency, I would seek donors willing to provide backing (in Bitcoin) for the value prior to launch, and also do away with the "Foundation" by using the blockchain both to allow users to submit projects requesting funds, and to allow miners (and perhaps coinholders as well, using proof-of-stake) to vote on the proposals, with disbursement of funds to approved projects handled automatically.

I think what they're trying to say here is that if you do what Western Union does (ie, take money from one person and pass it on to someone else), but with digital currency, you're a money transmitter. And since exchanges do, in fact, accept digital currency from one person and deliver it to another person, they clearly fit that definition.

A cursory glance at [this page]( reveals no differences which matter at the chip level--everything listed is at the protocol level, which makes no difference to the chip itself, given that the chip just accepts text and hashes it. ASIC chips do not verify signatures, nor do they otherwise concern themselves with the content of the data to be hashed. So, would you care to elucidate your previous comment?

I'm talking more about across-the-board lowering of tax rates rather than tax-code subsidies, as you're describing here.
I do like the idea of using the tax code to subsidize things, but I worry that in practice we'll just end up with exactly what we have today--a labyrinthine tax code, easily navigable by those with the resources to hire high-powered tax lawyers, which leads to the opposite of the desired tax situation (the desired situation being, poor people pay a smaller portion of their money than rich people do, and people who do good things pay less than they ordinarily would), and which has created an entire industry for tax processing because an ordinary person cannot possibly understand the tax code well enough to file complicated returns.

From what I can tell, it's percentage by which difficulty increases every 2016 blocks, and the values are the number of Bitcoins by which you'll be up at the end of 1 year given the constant difficulty increase rate at the top of the column.
This is really a very lazy way to calculate difficulty rise, because it's much more likely that the difficulty will follow an S-curve pattern rather than a simple exponential function, but S-curves are harder to calculate. I generally just make a pessimistic guess as to the average hashrate I expect to see in the first year, and calculate mining income from that. By running several scenarios, some of them *very* pessimistic, I've seen that my investment ought to do quite well.

Keep in mind that most news is like this (or at least, it's true of most news that deals with complex subject matter). As but one example, Columbine was not a reaction to bullying but a plan hatched by a psychopath and a suicidal kid to bomb (yes, bomb, not shoot up--the bomb didn't work properly so they had to resort to shooting, which had been only an ancillary part of their plan) their school. (The suicidal kid was just looking to off himself--apparently he fired a lot fewer shots, and those weren't generally very accurate.)
For another example, check out any mainstream media story about a scientific discovery, and then read take on that same discovery.

Personally, I think Krugman is still just knee-jerk reacting to what he sees as the apparent goldbug-ism of Bitcoin, which misses the larger point that it functions as a payment system (and potentially a lot more than that besides) regardless of its merits as a currency, and that what's impressive about it is that it's *programmable money*, not its apparently deflationary tendencies.

I'm not sure you understand how mining works. The size of the pool makes no difference in its luck, which is pure random chance. The biggest pool can have really shitty luck and the smallest pool can have incredible luck, or vice versa, or they can both have really good (or really shitty) luck. Size has absolutely nothing to do with luck.
Think of mining like a mini-lottery, only instead of having regular drawings, there's a standing set of numbers, and instead of picking your numbers, they're chosen randomly. A pool is just a whole lot of people all playing the lottery together, which reduces the variations that occur when each of them has very good or very bad luck. A streak of very bad luck while solo-mining could mean you earn nothing at all for months; a streak of very bad luck on a proportional-reward pool means you earn nothing for a few hours to days, depending on the pool size (note that smaller pools will give out fewer, larger payouts, while bigger ones will give out more, smaller ones).
TL;DR: Pooled mining is a way to ensure your earnings approach the average expected earnings. Luck is the level of deviation from those expected earnings. No matter how big or small the pool, the worse the luck, the less the pool's miners make.

A paper wallet is a Bitcoin address and its associated private key, both of which are stored on a piece of paper. The idea behind them is that you can create an address to which you can receive coins, whose private key is not stored on any computer (thus keeping the coins safe from hackers).
The Piper project and others seek to build and sell hardware to people to make the creation of paper wallets simple and easy, because as the Kickstarter explains, it's currently difficult.
Note that there is a major drawback to paper wallets: They don't function the way a typical wallet does. A standard Bitcoin wallet contains a number of addresses and private keys, and when coins are spent from one address, the client will either select a clean, unused address from within the wallet or generate a new one (which is then stored in the wallet), and send any remainders to that address. This is known as a "change address," and creates a problem with paper wallets for those not savvy enough to know that this happens.
The risk is that a paper-wallet user will import his/her private key into a standard wallet, then spend some coins and delete the wallet. If they do, any change that was sent to a different address in the wallet is lost. So, if you send 500 BTC to your paper wallet address, then import it to a standard client and spend 1 BTC before deleting the wallet you imported to, you have lost the 499 BTC which got sent to one of the other addresses in the wallet, and those coins are gone forever (because it's essentially impossible to guess the private key to a Bitcoin address).
Also note that the above explanation is oversimplified, as the wallet data can usually still be recovered after deletion, if no new data has been written to the location on the hard drive where it was stored.

How does regulation of Bitcoin exchanges in the US hurt people like you? You are completely unaffected by all of these machinations, so why do you oppose the efforts of those who will be?
It's very easy to say people shouldn't work with regulators if you're a healthy distance away from said regulators, but those of us here in America are not. If we want to engage in Bitcoin-related businesses, we will need to either work with regulators or face possible jail time. I prefer the former option, personally.

Frankly, I think a new form of currency is hardly going to undermine the dollar or the government the way many people in this subreddit seem to think it will.

Not really. With paypal, the buyer can scam the seller, but it's very rare for the opposite to occur (because the buyer usually gets his/her money back).

Fair point. I hope it does have that impact.
Also, I phrased that bit you quoted in a rather awkward way.

Nothing you just described involves cryptography at all.
I'm making no argument here about which is better, but consensus is not cryptography. Bitcoin is not a cryptocurrency because it relies on consensus among networked nodes; it is a cryptocurrency because it relies on cryptographic hashing to achieve said consensus. If Ripple does not use any cryptography to achieve its consensus (and what you've written here, as well as what I've read in the past, indicates that it does not), then it is not a cryptocurrency.

See, your mistake is generalizing from "altcoins" to "money." The exchange lost altcoins. No bitcoins were lost, however. The exchange cannot pay out all of the altcoins to users who supposedly carry an altcoin balance, but every bitcoin is still fully accounted for. Some of them were traded for what turned out to be imaginary altcoins, and those users who made those trades are out the bitcoins they traded away.
Now, if the exchange then decides to take bitcoins from users who had nothing to do with the altcoin problem, *then* you have a storage risk. But the problem is described as if the exchange is honest, and we already knew that dishonest exchanges present a risk.

Of course they can. It's merely a matter of sending you an official letter demanding that you send your BTC to address X.
Can they actually force you to give up your BTC? Well, that's a bit murky. If your BTC wallet is encrypted, and your passphrase is strong enough, the government can't confiscate the coins. But on the other hand, you already admitted to owning the BTC. So, although courts have so far pushed back against government attempts to force individuals to decrypt their data, the reasoning is usually that doing so robs the individual of his/her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, which doesn't hold up here. So you could end up in a situation where you'd have to give up the BTC or be put in jail for contempt of court.
Alternatively, the government could decide that all those court proceedings are a waste of time and money, and just start confiscating any and all of your other belongings, either until they get the value they were after (which probably means you lose more than that), or until you give up and let them have the BTC so you can get your stuff back.
Now, all of this is pure conjecture, and I have to say that the idea that the government would confiscate people's gold is a bit ridiculous at this point. In the 1930s, the currency was backed by gold, and we were experiencing a severe depression that was causing people to hoard their gold and thereby reduce economic activity even further. Now, you may disagree with the reasoning, execution, or both, but the fact is that with our currency no longer tied directly to gold, there is no good reason for the government to confiscate it. Plus, the source you're citing is so full of paranoia and empty of facts that I thought it originally came from ZeroHedge (and CaseyResearch is now on my list of "multi-ton grain of salt" sources).
And all of this is to say nothing of Bitcoins, which the government has even less incentive to confiscate than gold. At least the total amount of gold held in US private hands is worth vast sums of money. Bitcoins are worth less than $2B. That would keep the government's lights on for a couple hours at most.

I bought 10 BTC when the exchange rate was ~$145.

Call me a conspiracy theorist, but the first thing that sprang to mind was, they stole my BTC to make themselves a tidy $600 profit (they cancelled when the exchange rate was ~$205).

I'm pretty sure you're right. Also, the numbers in the chart itself are not in millions; only the numbers in the little equation below are in millions (in other words, their estimate of potential demand is ~$13.6 trillion).
So, divide 13.6 trillion by 13 million, multiply by the percentage on the left (e.g, by 0.01 for the 1% column, by 0.05 for 5%, etc), and then divide the result by the number on the top (the number of years) to get the number in the chart (roughly, that is--they're apparently not providing the exact figures here).

If you sent any Bitcoins to the "correct horse battery staple" address, they're probably gone. That address is being actively watched by thousands of opportunistic people worldwide, all hoping to get free BTC dumped into their laps.
As for how to make it stop, the easiest way is to export the keys for all of the addresses (EXCEPT "correct horse battery staple") in which your funds are stored. Keep a backup of the original wallet, in case you miss an address or two. Then import those keys one by one into a freshly-generated wallet.
To identify all of your addresses that are storing funds, find the blockchain.info page for your main address, to which you have sent your original funds (I'm guessing that you, like me, use one address for receiving coins, rather than using different addresses for receiving from different places. If I'm wrong, you'll have a more complicated task ahead of you). As an example, [this]( is the page for SatoshiDice's 91% address. Once you've gotten to the address page, look for every instance where you sent coins to someone else. Each of those transactions should have the coins you sent going to the destination address, along with a different amount (the change) going to a different address (one within your wallet). You will need to follow up on this address and see if it links you to any further change addresses. Once you've explored the blockchain sufficiently to know which of the addresses you control are funded (and here I am EXCLUDING the "correct horse battery staple" address, because you do NOT control it), you know which keys you need to export and then reimport to a fresh wallet.
Good luck, and I hope you haven't lost much money.

My information was old; I took economics in 2004, at a time when the savings rate absolutely was negative for the poor. Since then, things have changed: [savings rates]( for the poor are at a fraction of a percent. But the vast majority of them were already in debt.
Anyway, gold is not a financial instrument. Financial instruments pay out in dollars, and often at a fixed percentage, which means that inflation absolutely hits the wealthy. They have to do better than inflation on their investments or they lose, and they know it.
By contrast, poor people are *poor* because **they don't have enough money**. You cannot both have savings and not have enough money.

Clearly you don't know your US history. The [Articles of Confederation]( was the governmental system that was established after the colonies won the American Revolution. It had no power to tax on its own, nor to raise troops, and these and other limitations led to near-disaster. This government is distinct from the one established by the Constitution, which was written in 1787 to establish a stronger central government, because the government under the Articles was not working, and, as I said earlier, looked likely to fail.


If a private contract falls under the authority of the federal government as specified in the Constitution, nothing in the document prohibits the government from interfering with said contract. The idea that entering into contracts is a natural right is not one that has been enshrined into law in this country, so it has no bearing on this conversation. Pot growers have tried to assert a right to plant a seed, but that argument didn't hold up in court. The Ninth Amendment is not a declaration that people have a limitless wellspring of un-enumerated rights that must be respected whether or not they have been enshrined into law. It was put in place more to make people feel better about establishing a strong central government than anything else, and people promptly forgot about the Bill of Rights for quite some time after the Constitution was ratified (see: Alien and Sedition Acts).
Try having a look at how the Ninth and Tenth Amendments have been interpreted in the courts. Like it or not, our legal system is one of case law, so that's what really matters.

Funny, this is 2013. 2008 was five years ago. And the crash only happened at the end of that year, which is why I was excluding it to begin with.
And no, savings accounts aren't doing very well right now. But that will change as the economy recovers and inflation becomes a concern again, at which point rates will go up.
Moreover, people saving money is not beneficial to the economy at this point. Saving keeps money out of the economy, and what we desperately need right now is money being spent *into* the economy so that it can recover. Once the economy is going again and rates have been raised, savings accounts will once again beat inflation, and saving will once again benefit the overall economy (by ensuring that the savers will have money to spend when the economy goes bust).


Price stability means low inflation. Zero change in prices is not desirable, because the money supply grows by way of circulation, meaning that in times of growth, reducing inflation means pulling money out of the economy, which hurts growth. The job of the central bank is to keep growth and inflation balanced.
As for Braumol's disease, that's what we call "inflation." And the actual real cost of education is most certainly not going down; I can vouch for this as a recent college graduate.

For mining, you record the value of the Bitcoins (in fiat currency) at the time of receipt. From this number you can deduct the electricity cost and hardware depreciation, and you pay regular income tax on the resulting amount.
After that, any increase or decrease in the value of your results in a taxable gain/loss, and if you have a net gain over the year, you pay capital gains taxes on that.

Not much. ASICs are incredibly efficient, so the cost of power will only really start to matter (at current prices) if the difficulty shoots up to ~3 billion or more.

@_date: 2013-08-26 18:53:42


Do you think mining companies are immune to the need to recoup their initial investment? They have the same financial demands on them as smaller miners; they just have somewhat better unit costs due to economies of scale.
And as for ASICs continuing to get better at the rate they have been, I doubt that. Maybe an advance to 22nm in the next year or so, but we no longer have any big jumps we can make in terms of process size, and ASICs are it in terms of end-game hashing technology. So I don't think we're going to see the 28nm stuff totally outclassed for some time to come, probably not until the next halving.

If you can get the rest of society to buy onto your new tax, then it would seem that I have no choice but to follow the rules or GTFO (and in the United States, you don't need permission to leave unless you're already in trouble--this isn't Nazi Germany). That's the way society works.
I'm sorry you don't like the fact that taxation is not voluntary. But if you claim that people would pay their taxes on a voluntary basis, I have several very nice bridges to sell you. I mean, come on--lots of people don't even pay their taxes in a system where, as you say, not doing so can get you locked in a cage.

The thing is, the Keynesian logic works just fine on actual fiat (or even gold-backed) currencies. The key with Bitcoin is its divisibility.
Also, most people ask the wrong question. The question is not, "Can Bitcoin be a currency in its own right?" The answer to that question is unclear, mostly because the definition of 'currency' is still unclear--Bitcoin is challenging the way we understand currency. The proper question is, "Can Bitcoin be used as a medium of value exchange?" And the answer is unequivocally yes. That's why the Silk Road and BitPay and the BitcoinStore, among others, are still going despite the skyrocketing price of BTC. It's a medium of exchange, and there isn't an opportunity cost if you transfer in the funds you're spending to BTC and then spend the BTC. The opportunity cost issue only crops up when you have some currency lying around and you're wondering what to do with it.

Call me crazy, but when I hear the word "primed," I think "everything is in place and ready to go." This article gives a list of reasons why Kenyans *might* want to switch to Bitcoin, but offers no evidence that anyone there is actually inclined to do so. There isn't even a conversation with an actual Kenyan person. Overall, if I were a Kenyan myself, I would find this whole piece somewhat insulting: white people from far away want to push their own solution, about which I have never heard, to a problem that I haven't decided that I have, in order to benefit themselves.
This isn't to say I think Kenyans can't find uses for Bitcoin, but *it is up to them to do so*. They will probably pick it up and use it if we make it accessible and easy-to-use, but this kind of article isn't going to make that happen.

Fair point, and I thought of that too, but if you think about times when the U.S. was experiencing massive inflation, like the late 70s and early 80s, and then look at the DJIA chart, you'll notice that the growth in the DJIA doesn't correlate with inflation very well at all. In the late 70s and early 80s, the DJIA was mostly flat, and then in the 90s, which were a period of low to moderate inflation, the huge exponential spike occurred.


[citation needed]
But seriously, bubbles definitely happen on a massive scale. The housing market bubble's size was in the trillions, and the dot-com bubble was huge too.


Bitcoin is brand-new, which means that rapid growth is definitely justifiable (though I'm not arguing that the Bitcoin growth we've seen is necessarily justified, just that it isn't necessarily unjustified). And the DJIA, which was not at all new at the time, rose by more than sixfold over the 18-year period of greatest growth (1982-2000).
My point is mainly that exponential growth, though ultimately unsustainable, does not automatically lead to a total crash; rather, prices usually recover after crashes, if the asset has real value. And I think Bitcoin does have real value.

Those 20k Avalon chips account for a mere 8 TH/s, and ASICMINER sales are negligible in terms of contribution. Who do you think is supplying that hashing power? The vast majority of network hashing power is being provided by BFL hardware.
Oh, and May 9 is really, really late to the party. (I'm a latecomer myself, and I paid for my last order on 04/03/13.) But don't worry too much about it--the vast majority of orders were placed early on, so the shipping dates are going to start moving a lot faster. You should expect the network hashrate to be at least 1500 TH/s or so by the time you get it, however--which, according to their latest estimate (which is a repeat of an earlier estimate rather than a further delay, thus providing a faint glimmer of hope that they may actually hit it) should be by the end of September.

It means you're far, *far* less likely to be fucked, because not many zero-days are being used very widely prior to being patched. Most of them are being used by one person or organization, and they aren't talking about it, because they have no desire to see it patched. Really, the bigger risk is to leave a vulnerable version of the software running when a patch is available, because once it's been patched, *everybody* knows how to exploit it.


That is a really interesting idea, actually! Still, if it became widely-used (i.e., lucrative) enough, hackers would just start looking for (and ultimately finding) vulnerabilities there too.

How does this substitute mob rule for courts? The community is only providing information to law enforcement upon request and in cases that appear to be legitimate. Law enforcement presumably still has to operate through the courts to then take action on that information. I appreciate your concerns, though, and they do resonate--I'm not saying the idea Hearn sketches out sounds terribly good to me either. But it's a start, and I have to agree with Hearn that we need to have this conversation and try to figure out what to do, because doing nothing is going to lead to numerous people being introduced to Bitcoin by a vicious piece of malware. 
After all, the ability to send money to anyone, anywhere doesn't seem so appealing when you're being forced into it. And it's not just one little old lady, it's huge numbers of people all over the place, including no small number of small businesses that can ill afford the extortion.

Right now I'm 100% certain that all Bitcoin mining hardware, including preorders and planned ASICs, totals less than $500M in retail value.
The NSA has a budget of billions of dollars per year (~$10B-12B according to random people on the Internet), and if enough congressmen and Senators get cranky about Bitcoin, that number could double or triple as needed. Remember that the US government's resources are almost unlimited--they can borrow as much money as they want.
Sure, in 20 years, it will be nigh unto impossible for the NSA to kill Bitcoin, but right now, *it is eminently possible*. And right now is when the government is taking notice of Bitcoin, not 20 years from now. The upshot of all of this is that fighting the government head-on is certain to be a losing battle, whereas lobbying will keep Bitcoin around for enough time to get it entrenched.

I highly doubt this comment will be viewed kindly here, but as a liberal (!), I have to say that I think governments will find ways to link people to their bitcoins one way or another. Sooner or later you have to exchange your bitcoins for something (cash, gold, groceries, whatever), and once you do, Uncle Sam has a shot at connecting your bitcoins to you.
Keep in mind that the wealthy already dodge their taxes to an alarming degree (evaded taxes amount to far more than the deficit every year, meaning it's the fault of wealthy tax cheats--who often claim to want a balanced budget--that we don't have a balanced budget). So it's not like Bitcoin is really changing that much; it's just another way people can avoid taxes. The IRS will still audit people and investigate, and as time goes on their methods of connecting bitcoins to people will get more and more sophisticated, just as they have for the existing financial system over the past century.
As a liberal, I also don't like the sales/consumption tax angle that people are suggesting here, because such taxes tend to disproportionately burden the poor while the wealthy pay a pittance. No, what we need is a tax structure that rewards *work* more than it does investment, which isn't what we have now, and a sales-tax-based system would be even more favorable to investors at the expense of workers.

2. Even if you're a criminal, all you have to do to cover your ass is send all the BTC to a fresh, new address (for deniability, e.g., "I gave those coins to some guy to buy something," and ideally the new address is in a fresh wallet to avoid the potential for contamination), and then mix the coins.

If you follow this subreddit, you've probably heard about upwards of 30% of the Bitcoin thefts that have occurred in the past few months, and probably a bigger portion than that. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people (at a minimum) have had their credit card accounts used fraudulently over the same time period.
Think of the two biggest credit-card-number heists in history. The biggest was a hacker stealing recorded credentials from TJMaxx, and the second-biggest was Iceman stealing recorded credentials from vulnerable points-of-sale nationwide. In both cases, the hackers would not (in fact, *could* not) have gotten the credentials of customer accounts had the payments taken place using Bitcoin. Yes, TJMaxx and/or the vulnerable merchants could have lost their own Bitcoins in those heists (had they been using BTC instead of CC transactions), but not their customers' money, as they did in real life.

Well, that's only part of it. The other part is that in such conditions (a bad economy which is experiencing deflation), the most sensible thing to do with your money is stuff it under your mattress. When everyone does that, it leads to further economic stagnation, which leads to further deflation as more people stop spending and investing (to the maximum extent that they can), etc etc.
However, deflation in boom times might not be such a bad thing. If the theory is correct, deflation would encourage people to save their money, pushing growth back down to earth, whereas the inflation resulting from bad times would tend to spur investment and thus growth, both counter-cyclical effects that would seem (to this armchair economist, anyway) to help balance the boom-and-bust cycle.

Some people might go on here about legal risks (which, under the wrong circumstances, could potentially have been a real thing, but at this point I doubt they would be) and possibly even conspiracy theories. Believe those if you wish (and perhaps Satoshi did, after all), but there are plenty of perfectly normal reasons why he would want to hide his identity.
Suppose you're a relatively private person. You come up with an idea that you know is absolutely brilliant, and as you go about creating it and putting it out into the world you feel absolutely sure, deep down, that it will become a huge thing--or at least, that it genuinely *could*. You know that if it ever catches on at all, you won't be able to hide from the spotlight ever again--you'll be the darling of the tech world, with all of the crazy fandom and inexplicable hatred that goes along with such a status. Think about it: even now, if we knew who Satoshi was, don't you think he'd be getting calls from journalists a couple of times per week to weigh in on this or that development in the Bitcoin space? How much of his time would have been spent on-camera in the week that followed the Silk Road bust, for instance? If you're the kind of person that loves to work on cool new projects, as we have to assume Satoshi is, that kind of obligation would start to chafe rather quickly.
So Satoshi definitely has reasons not to want us to know who he is, even aside from any perceived risks that his status as the creator of Bitcoin might have entailed or might now entail.

A link is not a photo or a video. Also, links can break. So, no.
Would I feel differently if there were images/videos encoded in the blockchain? In some ways, yes--I myself would feel somewhat violated--but in others, no. Would we consider people who maintain Internet infrastructure to be culpable for the many despicable files people use that infrastructure to send? No, and I don't feel that the blockchain should be thought of any differently.
*However*, if those same operators of Internet infrastructure turned a blind eye when they noticed these despicable files, I would then consider them culpable. No, we can't excise the data from the blockchain. But we can definitely explore the blockchain to identify the entity responsible for adding it, and pass that information along to law enforcement.  No, we can't stop people from using Bitcoins to buy and sell things we could consider heinous (which include not only child pornography but also assassinations on certain Tor-located markets), but we can do whatever we can  as a community to hinder them. That's what the OP is suggesting, and I think it's a perfectly legitimate point. Neither your quibbling about the definition of violence nor your point about pollution of the blockchain have any bearing on whether we as a community ought to take steps to undermine the use of Bitcoin for the commercial distribution of child pornography.

There are no property taxes in the US at the federal level, so the primary source for road work funding is the gasoline tax.

I would be very surprised if the total amount spent on such projects in an ordinary year was less than the amount collected in gasoline taxes.
(Note that the gasoline tax really ought to be raised--in fact, I would be OK with getting rid of CAFE standards if we could use the gas tax to set a price floor of $4/gal on gasoline/diesel to push the market towards alternatives).
Education is primarily funded by local property taxes, it's true, but the federal government provides a substantial amount of funding to US public schools, which is generally used to nudge localities in desired educational directions (for example, giving extra money to districts that educate kids with special needs, although I actually just made it up--I don't know if the federal government actually  does this).
(Note that property taxes originated in a time when the amount of land a person owned determined his or her income, because almost everybody was a farmer. Today, it doesn't really make much sense, and I'd be perfectly happy paying higher income taxes if property taxes could be eliminated.)
In both cases, federal income taxes do provide a significant portion of the needed funding.

This analysis is riddled with holes; where to even begin?
First of all, this (on the subject of who bears the cost of developing renewable energy resources):


This completely ignores the economic benefits that such development brings, which will help to pay off the investment over time, and may even do better than break-even for the government when additional tax revenues are taken into account.
Then there's the bit under Figure 6, a graph of population in in the US, EU-27, and Japan as well as in the rest of the world:


This is assumption is complete garbage. World population is expected to top out at ~10 billion at about mid-century, which means that unless her ruler is asymptotically curved, her estimate is high by billions of people.
And then there's the bit about the Citigroup analysis, which says that a tipping point in global oil demand is coming due to a shift toward natural gas and improvements in fuel economy. First she says:


But later on, she says:


She then shows [this chart](
Now, maybe I've learned different definitions for the words that make up the phrase "oil demand is approaching a tipping point," but as best I can tell, she says that the claim is "out-and-out baloney" before explaining why it's completely accurate according to her own analysis.

I dont try to predict exactly what I'll make--that's essentially impossible. I don't know what the S-curve will ultimately look like.
What I've done is run a number of scenarios and determined the rate of mining income for each, as well as a number of "how much would difficulty have to be for X amount of hashrate to generate only Y dollars per day at current prices?" scenarios. From these, I've been able to ascertain that it's extremely unlikely that the hashrate will reach levels that threaten my profitability.
Some equations:
D = (H * 600) / 2^32
where D is difficulty and H is total network hashrate in hashes per second
S = (H * 86400) / 2^32
where S is the expected number of difficulty 1 shares per day and H is hashrate in hashes per second
I = (S / D) * (25 * (1 - F))
Where I is income per day in BTC, S is difficulty 1 shares per day, D is difficulty, and F is pool fee as a decimal (ie 3% fee = 0.03)

Do the math. The last ASICMINER dividend was 0.0124, and people are predicting 0.015 today if hardware sales are included. If they're right, and we assume that *all* of that is from hardware sales, and that all the hardware sold is blades because they provide more GH/s per Bitcoin (none of which is even close to true, but let's make the assumptions just for demonstration), then here are the numbers:
    400,000 * 0.015 = 6000 BTC
    6000 BTC / 3.5 BTC/blade = 1714.2857 blades
    1714.2857 blades * 13 GH/s per blade = 22.285 TH/s
As you can see, that would be negligible. And that dwarfs the piddly numbers they're actually contributing each week. So ASICMINER sales are not important in the hashrate calculation.

I wouldn't say the stock market is a bubble, exactly--in fact, I'd argue the opposite: that exponential growth for a period of time does not automatically mean an asset is experiencing a bubble. Sometimes it does, but only when the exponential growth is not actually justified by the real value of the asset. (That said, I do think stocks aren't the super-investment that Wall Street wants us to think they are. Also, I hate 401ks; I think they're a scam perpetrated on us by Wall Street and wealthy executives.)
Bitcoin's value is in the fact that it can be used to transact value between essentially any two people or organizations on Earth, in a relatively short time frame, with minimal fees, with the possibility of anonymity for one or both parties (if desired), and that those transactions cannot be fraudulently reversed after the fact. Is the growth justified by the value? I certainly think so. But we'll have to wait and see if our faith is well-placed.

I'm by no means an expert on this technology, but my understanding is that Grover's algorithm will solve hashes.
But it's that wording that is tricky: when I say it "solves" hashes, I mean that you can find the text you need to hash to generate a particular hash value. Quantum computers eliminate the guesswork that makes the Bitcoin system actually work. As such, quantum computers do not represent an advance in hashing power (which would mean an improvement in the speed of the guesswork) but rather an existential threat to Bitcoin, and when they start to become a reality, the Bitcoin system, if it still exists, will be forced to take action to mitigate or eliminate that threat (probably by switching to quantum- or thermodynamics-based signatures and hashes).

Given that there's no way to force someone to pay back a Bitcoin loan (aside from standard contract enforcement measures, which don't work very well against anonymous counterparties), there is no good reason why Mt.Gox wouldn't have control of all the BTC that have been deposited there.

That risk has always been present in the form of a potential 51% attack. This 25% attack relies on economic incentives causing miners to join in and grow the attacker's hashing power, which would not appeal to any miners that know a damn thing about how Bitcoin works (which ought to be, but probably isn't quite, all of them). So, a hacker could get the requisite 25%, sure, but is arguing that he wouldn't see anybody joining in, and rather would more likely lose the stolen hashing power rapidly as honest miners realized what was happened.

If you can't afford to hold a 10-year Treasury to maturity, then don't buy one. I have no sympathy for stupid people who make foolish investment decisions like holding all their savings in cash under the mattress or buying Treasuries for a longer timespan than they can afford to hold them. (There's this thing called a "savings account" for those who want to save short-term, and over the short term, inflation makes little difference in purchasing power anyway).
You can't have it both ways; you're arguing that *in the short term*, people might lose on Treasuries, while you're simultaneously arguing that *in the long term*, inflation destroys the value of cash, if you just hold onto it (like a moron). Which are we talking about? Short- or long-term? (Keep in mind that even if one got stuck with sub-2% interest rates for a 10-year period recently, the 100+ year Treasury strategy still comes out way ahead of inflation over that period.)
@_date: 2013-08-31 16:03:23


GDP is unaffected by the growth of the value of savings; only moving money matters for calculating GDP. Hence this is a completely incorrect analysis.
However, I actually agree with you that a -2% economic growth rate in a world that uses Bitcoin almost exclusively does not make any sense if Bitcoin is deflating.
You see, if economic growth is -2% per year, then there is 2% less movement of money each year. For Bitcoin, whose supply would be very nearly constant at the point in time being described, that means that instead of deflating by *any* amount, one could expect to see roughly 2% *in*flation each year, since the value of a fixed quantity of money ought to rise in times of economic growth and fall in times of economic contraction.

And here is where we disagree: I don't feel that it is trivializing the suffering of those who have been physically harmed to categorize sexual abuse (and the callous commercial exploitation of the same) as violence.
In fact, to argue the opposite seems, to me, to be trivializing the suffering of the victims of sexual abuse/child pornography. After all, we consider a guy who gets stabbed in a bar fight to be a victim of violence, and yet the harm done to him (assuming he lives, and isn't paralyzed or something) is minimal as violence goes; as soon as he leaves the hospital, he'll move on with his life. By contrast, the emotional damage that sexual abuse (and the distribution of images/videos of same) causes generally lasts a lifetime.

As for $1000/BTC, I'm actually counting on that *not* happening--I want to make back all my Bitcoins and then some. If the exchange rate soars, miners have more money coming in to buy new hardware, and mining looks increasingly attractive to non-miners as well, which would cause a continuation of the exponential rise in difficulty.

Left of center, with some socialist tendencies (for instance, I don't think the free market works for health care, and I would prefer a single-payer system).

- We don't like big banks (personally, I wanted them liquidated, not bailed out).
- We don't like crony capitalism (I don't want to see any more damned industry insiders being hired as regulators of their own industry).
- We don't approve of the military-industrial complex (the Pentagon doesn't want any more goddamn tanks, and can we *please* kill the F-35 already?).
- We don't like the way campaign finance is done today, nor the incestuous two-party lesser-of-two-evils election system we have today (and don't get me started on fucking *swing states* and early primary states).
- We don't approve of the use of "state secrets" to kill lawsuits against unconstitutional wiretapping, nor of the NDAA, nor detaining suspects without *habeas corpus*, nor the soft torture that passes for interrogation, nor the FBI's constant entrapment schemes, nor the murderous drone war, nor the total lack of prosecutions against those in the previous administration who were responsible for the torture of detainees, nor the war on whistleblowers, nor any of the numerous other ways our civil liberties are being constantly eroded.
- We don't agree with the War on Drugs (it's killed more people and wasted more lives than just about any drug I know of, except perhaps alcohol or tobacco--but those are fucking legal).
Now, there are still many areas in which we disagree, such as gun control, taxation, deficits and the debt, spending, and probably others, depending on the individual, but it's important to recognize the common ground we do have, even if our prescriptions for those problems are drastically different.

Yes and no; miners are currently being rewarded rather handsomely. When I got into Bitcoin just after the June 2011 crash, the first price I saw was $17.50/BTC, which meant that the 50 BTC reward per block (at the time) was worth $875. Today, the price is roughly $42/BTC, so the current 25 BTC reward is worth $1050.
That said, I understand what you meant, and when the block reward becomes less significant, no-fee transactions *will* be a losing prospect for miners.
In addition, I've heard that there's a bit of a problem with miners including no transactions at all in their blocks (save the reward transaction, of course). Has anyone looked into solving that problem, or are we just going to wait until plain economics makes it a losing strategy?

We will have many years of warning before quantum computing becomes a threat, so an orderly move to a different signature algorithm is entirely feasible, and addresses left un-upgraded are still protected by the hashing algorithms, which, despite your fear-mongering, is massive protection that will not be breached without someone finding one of the aforementioned weaknesses.
And I say this as someone who believes Litecoin is unlikely to just die off and go away.

Yeah, I really am getting sick of the insistence that we have to just scrap the (flawed but still mostly functional) society we have in order to achieve progress. Seems to me that kind of thinking was popular in France in 1789, and things didn't end up going very well when they followed through on it.

Which is why it's convenient that Bitcoin is not trying to support an economy, but rather enable the secure and fast transfer of money between any two parties with an internet connection, regardless of either party's location or legal status.
It's the currency of the Internet, not the currency of a particular economy. All of the real economies still have their inflationary fiat currencies to push people to invest and grow the economy. Bitcoin just sort of sits on top of that and helps reduce the resistance to the flow of money.

I don't believe Bitcoin is going to undermine existing governments and financial structures (as many libertarian Bitcoin enthusiasts do) but rather offer an add-on to them. Many of the ideas and hopes that libertarians (going right back to Satoshi himself) attach to Bitcoin are indeed in direct opposition to liberal thinking, but that doesn't mean that Bitcoin itself is.
Moreover, although I do think central banks and banking have a role to play in the future of finance, that doesn't mean I think the current system is just peachy. I think banking is supposed to be an incredibly boring industry. That means no insanely complicated financial instruments, no selling off securitized mortgages in order to dump the risk onto others, no gambling with clients' money, etc. Banks should do two things: 1) accept deposits, and 2) lend out those deposits to low-risk borrowers. Any other activity belongs in an investment bank, and those should be very explicitly *not* insured by taxpayers. I also wouldn't mind an audit of the Fed, even if I don't think there's going to be some kind of evil cabal exposed by it--there might well be some fraud and/or abuse going on.
So yeah, there is definitely much about which I disagree with libertarians, but that doesn't mean I dislike Bitcoin. I'm interested to see if the deflation does indeed become a problem or if the fear of deflation is based on factors that apply to fiat money but not to Bitcoin.
Moreover, liberals aren't opposed to decentralization on principle. We feel that there are abuses taking place that can only be effectively stopped by a government, and we believe that the government, as an extremely powerful institution, has the power to effect great good for vast numbers of people, but that doesn't mean we want to centralize every aspect of society. Rather, it means that we're often skeptical that a decentralized alternative to the current centralized model will work as desired (here I'm talking generally rather than about currencies or economies specifically). That said, if you can present a model in which decentralization does work (like Bitcoin), I think many liberals will take happily to it; we're not exactly ignorant of the dangers of giving the government too much power. We are, however, often concerned about taking away the good powers of government along with the bad (so, for instance, I have no problem with governments working to tax Bitcoins like they would any other currency, because taking away the power to tax means taking away the power to build infrastructure and prosecute criminals and the many other good things the government does with its money).

And since Bitcoin's inception, we've seen 3 to 3.5 revolutions in hashing power:
`1. Originally the network was populated by CPUs.`
`2. Then came GPU mining, which pushed CPUs out.`
`2.5. Then we started seeing FPGAs.`
`3.5. Now we're getting ASICs.`
There are no more revolutions coming. Only Moore's Law will increase the network hashrate from now on, and I don't expect that it will keep getting 1% more ahead of schedule every year after the network has been flooded with ASICs.

That can only happen once we have a viable alternative to oil. Once we do, I see no reason to care about oil in the slightest.


[South Korea apparently disagrees]( According to a source I found online, extracting lithium from seawater costs 2.2 to 3.2 cents per gram (by one process, anyway), or 22 to 32 dollars per kilogram. That's a whole lot more than it is now, but again, the lithium isn't what makes a battery expensive; that's the cost of manufacture. By the time we need to pull lithium from seawater, the manufacturing costs will be so much lower that people won't even notice the increased lithium costs. Moreover, this is all assuming that lithium batteries are the endgame, which I highly doubt.
And the only uses of copper that actually require copper itself are, to my knowledge, chemical (when you need one element, a different one won't do).

As an aside, if anyone wants to buy a mining rig from someone honest, I have two rigs for sale for $1600 each (Ubuntu 12.10 systems, 4x Gigabyte HD7950 each, 2100MH/s SHA-256 @ 850W each, or 2300 KH/s Scrypt @ 1000W each; power figures are without any cooling added in). I've been procrastinating making them turn-key (e.g., you turn them on and they start mining without any further help), but it's pretty trivial to do, and I'll even get them set up to mine on the buyer's pool(s), if desired. I'd prefer to sell them together (I'll do that for $3000) because they're currently built into a single metal shelf thing and separating them would require putting together a pair of new "cases." Note that I spent just under $2000 on each rig (I'm selling because I have ASICs coming this summer, and including the rigs, all that hardware uses more power than the circuits I've got can supply).
PM me if you're interested. I have photos, if desired.

The whole argument about deflation and hard money makes little sense unless we assume that the Bitcoin economy will go closed-loop (e.g., people can receive Bitcoins and buy what they need with them, without ever needing to convert to fiat--which I doubt will happen anytime soon). As it stands, it's just a commoditized payment system, and I question the idea that traditional economic rules that apply to standard fiat currencies make any sense when talking about such a system.
And even if they did go closed-loop, here's the thing about hard money: absent a government choosing how "hard" the money is, people can decide to accept and use a new cryptocurrency to "soften" the money supply, if they so choose. Remember how the populists in America around the turn of the 20th century wanted to "soften" the money supply by adding the silver standard in addition to gold? Well, they had to appeal to the US Government to try to make that happen. Here on the internet, all people have to do is decide that they want to use Litecoin (or whatever) in addition to Bitcoin, and the money supply is instantly "softer" for those individuals than it was previously.

Most people here are extremely pessimistic about mining. Now, there are a lot of unknowns, but if we assume that the price stays stable at $100/BTC, you're looking at breaking even on a Jalapeno in under a year, most likely (without accounting for power costs). I would expect difficulty to be above 100M by the time you receive the unit (which will probably be late summer at the earliest, and perhaps as late as late fall).
As for pooled vs solo mining, don't even bother solo mining. Why? Because you are counting on having good luck if you do. See, finding a block is purely random chance, and in theory you can do a bit better mining solo, but in reality, the difficulty changes (read: goes up) every 2 weeks or so. That means that you have a worse and worse chance of finding a block as time goes by, so you ultimately miss out on easier Bitcoins because you were solo-mining and not finding a block. This same problem applies to smaller pools (&lt;5% of network hashing power): bad luck early on cannot be made up by good luck later, because the odds get worse as time does on.
By contrast, pooled mining pays out steadily. You'll get only slightly less on average in a pool than you would solo (because of fees), but in reality you'll do better because you get steady payouts, so you can be sure you won't miss out on the easier coins.
You can expect to be making less than 0.02 BTC per day, though, and you'll probably spend about $0.10/day or less on power (unless you pay more than $0.15/kWh, in which case you should do the math yourself: 0.03 * 24 * &lt;your_price_per_kWh&gt;).
It's impossible to say if it will be worthwhile, because no one knows what the price will do. If it stays stable, then mining is a great investment. If it tanks, not so much. If it shoots up, then mining is an amazing investment. I speak from personal experience: for months back in late 2011, my GPU rig seemed pretty unimpressive, investment-wise; a friend of mine would visit from time to time and ask how much money we'd made from it, and for a while, that number was going down, even as the number of Bitcoins we had went up. As the price rose going into 2012, I talked my parents into buying a BFL FPGA Single for $600, and that looked like a decent investment, given that it was making a couple dollars a day. Then the 2013 bubble happened, and now both the GPU rig and the FPGA Single are probably the best investments either I or my parents have ever made.

Not at all. It just means the program is buggy, which tends to increase the chances of a vulnerability, but not every crash is exploitable (in fact, the vast majority aren't).
And I don't understand why you think this is so different from Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, credit card numbers, etc. These things are stolen all the time (indeed, since they're transmitted over the Internet, they're in many ways easier to steal than Bitcoins, for which you only send a cryptographic signature), but nobody says we shouldn't let non-tech-savvy people buy things, pay bills, or submit job applications online.

There was a hard fork back in March. It was handled quickly because the whole community mobilized. The devs sent out an alert about it, the news made it to the forums and reddit extremely quickly, the pool operators took action, and the miners who weren't sure which pools were safe to mine at (myself included) turned off their hardware until they could determine which pools were running the correct software.
And the reason everyone is relaxed about the idea of pool operators going rogue is this: All you can do with a 51% attack is spend your BTC twice, and stop everyone else's transactions from going through. You can't steal BTC from anyone else, nor can you create fake BTC. And there are two possible scenarios following a 51% attack: either confidence in Bitcoin is destroyed and something else takes its place, or the attacker gives up and the community restores its fork of the blockchain as the main chain, wiping out anything that happened on the attack chain. In the case of the former, the attack has destroyed the entire system, along with the value of any BTC he didn't spend (and since double-spends are primarily used to buy something and then still keep the BTC, that means his BTC are now worthless and he might as well have just spent them to begin with). In the case of the latter, the attacker may have gotten some goods using the double-spent Bitcoins, but it's trivial to determine which address(es) double-spent during the attack and call for the community to blacklist them. It would be an extraordinary step, but after a 51% attack, I doubt there'd be much opposition to it. To top all of this off, the attacker had to have massive amounts of hashing power on the network in order to perform the attack, which would have made a very large amount of BTC without any risk simply by mining honestly.
As you can see, there's really no reason for anyone within the Bitcoin community to attempt a 51% attack, because doing so would almost certainly lose them more than the value of whatever it is they could hope to gain.
As for the concern about governments, I wouldn't worry about that either. Why not, given that the NSA could probably build enough ASICs even now to pull off a 51% attack? Well, the reason is simple: governments are slow to react, and the world's governments have only just noticed Bitcoin, and they're still working (slowly) to figure out just what the implications of its existence are likely to be.

I honestly don't know all that much about silicon fab technology, so I couldn't really tell you. I can tell you that Wikipedia has [32nm]( (the closest to 28nm that it lists) listed as being a 2010 technology, and [22nm]( listed as being a 2012 technology, and you should expect to see a similar amount of time between the start of 28nm ASICs and the start of 22nm ASICs, but I have no idea when 28nm ASICs first became available (in general, not just for Bitcoin mining), so I can't give you a good estimate on when 22nm will be here.
I can tell you that the major operations like Intel are done with 22nm and are moving on to new process nodes, so the technology is beginning to filter out.

You know, there are companies out there in which everyone knows exactly how much everyone else is paid. And yet they still function! is right that not talking about salaries is only beneficial to employers--that's how they get away with things like paying Lily Ledbetter less than her male colleagues for decades.
That said, asking how many Bitcoins someone has, on a public internet forum, is a bit gauche, because if they have a lot, and they say so, they instantly become a target for hackers. Which, I realize as I'm rereading your post, is exactly what you just said.

Don't get me wrong: I think Bitcoin will improve the lives of a huge number of people--but do you really think it's going to save us from our own darker impulses? I mean, PirateAt40 ran a Bitcoin Ponzi scheme, someone just stole CrazyBlane's Avalon unit, at least one online wallet service closure was suspected to be a theft by the operator (MyBitcoin), and there are numerous hackers out there trying to steal people's Bitcoins.
I know that this community is full of honest, decent, and generous people like yourself, and I love that. But I just don't see how Bitcoin, as a technology (or, in simpler terms, a tool), is going to change the way people in general treat one another.

While this is unlikely to be a popular comment, I have to point out that you're comparing apples and oranges here, and as such being unfair to the US dollar (!). See, Silk Road 1.0 saw 9.5 million BTC pass through its hands, so some very large percentage of BTC has likely been used for criminal activity *at some point*. And the same is true of US dollars, as is made detectable by the drugs which can be found on the physical notes themselves. But to suggest that 10% of US dollars are *currently* being used for criminal activity is, I think, a considerable exaggeration.

1. Individuals and corporations are taxed differently because they are different types of legal entities, not because their means of making money varies.
2. This is about regulation (not taxation) of a specific use (exchange) of a specific type of money, where one person who gets the money one way has only to use a legitimate exchange to comply with the law when exchanging, while another person who gets the money a different way has to pay millions in fees and comply with a long list of regulations in order to legally exchange his earnings at the same legitimate exchange. How does it make sense to regulate the same transaction differently depending on where the funds came from (assuming they were legitimately earned)?

EDIT: I read the comments and he touched on it a bit more; he's apparently talking about these services *for merchants*. I still don't get his thing about "fast flawless processing," but he keeps viewing Bitcoin as if it's a business, which is just completely wrongheaded. If he wants to analyze a Bitcoin payments business, he ought to look at BitPay or CoinBase.

The eurocrisis and global warming are definitely real. But these aren't, necessarily:


Peak oil: The issue with peak oil is that there's still vast amounts of oil. The problem is that it all costs more to pull out of the ground than it used to. Think the tar sands in Canada, the oil fields deep under the saltbeds at the bottom of the ocean off Brazil, and the oil buried under the Arctic seafloor. There's huge amounts of oil there, it just costs more to get to it. This means that the oil problem will ultimately solve itself; as oil becomes too expensive, people will find alternatives that make better economic sense.
Peak lithium: This one is complete FUD garbage. The reality is that lithium is incredibly plentiful. If we run out of easily-mined lithium, we can still extract it from seawater at relatively low cost. It should also be noted that the cost of batteries is not driven by the cost of lithium but rather the cost to manufacture them.
Peak copper: This one I hadn't ever heard of before. According to [wikipedia]( though, it's not likely to happen until around 2100 or so. And at least some of the things we do with copper can be done with other materials (think graphene wires) if copper becomes too expensive.

The way it happened in Worgl was that the mayor put down 40,000 schillings to guarantee the value of 40,000 schillings' worth of stamp scrip, which has the constant decrease in value thing going on (note that the "lost" value doesn't disappear; in Worgl's case it went to the government, which could then use it for various public works projects, and in Freicoin's case it goes to the miners). He then started using the stamp scrip to pay for the projects he wanted to do, and the whole thing really took off from there.

Hmmm. I'll grant that I hadn't thought it through fully. My primary point was that it wouldn't be *guaranteed* to be deflationary the way Bitcoin is. I have to concede, though, that you're right: it would be deflationary during periods of economic growth (when the economy grows faster than the money supply), and inflationary during periods of recession (when the money supply increase outpaces economic growth).
However, in thinking about it, is that such a bad thing? Wouldn't deflation during the good times, and inflation during the bad, be counter-cyclical, and therefore work to offset the boom-and-bust cycle we all know so well?

This is less secure than your previous example, because if an attacker finds out the salted password hash, that's effectively the password, so a database compromise on the server end compromises user accounts too.

I very much disagree with this statement,  based as it is on the underpinnings of libertarian philosophy.

More importantly, I do not believe that war and the nation-state are inseparable concepts.
As for how the atomic bomb has centralized things, it has forced nations to band together to form organizations (such as the UN) that can both a) work to ensure peaceful relations between nuclear-armed states, and b) work to prevent nuclear proliferation, something that can only be countered by a centralized authority acting to limit access to the materials and technologies necessary for building a nuclear weapon.

No, actually--I used to say this same thing, but recently I saw a post by someone here about it.
What happened was, the price spiked to almost $32, then crashed back below $20. Then, when the price had dropped to ~$17, someone hacked Mt.Gox. The attacker was able to a) steal password hashes and emails from Mt.Gox's database, and b) change the amounts of BTC and USD that Mt.Gox had him as owning. As such, the attacker was able to flood the exchange with fake BTC sales, which tanked the price to near-nothing. Note that no actual BTC were stolen from Mt.Gox itself in this attack (although users whose passwords were compromised likely lost some BTC); the attacker could only change how many BTC Mt.Gox *thought* he had, which allowed him to completely control the market price. Mt.Gox shut down trading for about 5 or 6 days, then resumed operations after apparently fixing the problem and kicking out the attacker.

At this point, there are no inexpensive options for mining hardware that is likely to be viable long term (specifically, 28nm hardware, such as KnC, CoinTerra, HashFast, and the BFL Monarch, but the cheapest of those is the 200 GH/s, ~320W KnC Saturn at $2995, which is supposed to ship in November, then the 600 GH/s, 350W BFL Monarch at $4680, which is supposed to be shipping in February or so). Which means there are no profitable low-cost options.
And it's absolutely impossible to say how fast anything could pay itself back, but if you're just ordering now, then to get something that will ever pay itself back, you need 28nm hardware, which starts at $2,995 for 200 GH/s (KnC Saturn, described above) and goes up to $13,999 for 2 TH/s (CoinTerra, ~1100W, supposed to ship in December).
PS: Two months is not "long-ish-term." My old GPU rig paid paid for itself over the course of a school year (and I had *free power*, too). It was only because I held onto the coins as they rose in value that I made so much money on that rig.
Also, keep in mind that mining can be a pain in the ass. BFL hardware is remarkably user-friendly, but even there, you have to babysit the thing, because it can go down anytime, as can the pool (I've even had pools--only one of which was a *Bitcoin* pool, but still, *multiple* pools--die outright on me).

I generally just run the numbers on a very pessimistic estimate of future hashrate and see what kind of income that generates. Take an estimate that represents what you think is a reasonable guess at the average difficulty over the life of your hardware, then multiply that by at least two (ideally more like 4-6, for safety), and see what you'd earn over your hardware's expected lifespan (or the timespan you're concerned about; I usually calculate for a year). The point is to get a good estimate of what things would look like if you're badly wrong. If you still like what you see even then, then you might be looking at a good potential investment.

If inflation is 0%, you're paying 6% real interest on the loan; if it's 3%, you're only paying 3% real interest. Therefore it is better for you (if you're in debt) if there is inflation than if there isn't. By contrast, if there was 3% *de*flation, you'd be paying 9%. So inflation helps those in debt, while deflation hurts those in debt.
These are basic economic facts that no one disputes. Not the Keynesians, not the Friedman-ites, and not the Austrians. They disagree about what the optimal condition is for the overall economy, but none of them would argue that inflation doesn't reduce the burden of fixed-rate debt.

There's a reason change gets sent to a new address each time (actually, two; the first one is for maintaining anonymity): every time you spend from an address, you reveal the public key of that address in order to sign the transaction. While there are no known weaknesses in the cryptography being used, if someone should find one, an address that has spent coins at least once is less well-protected against an attack. (Note that a weakness wouldn't blow all the gates wide open; it would mean a reduction in how hard it is to crack the encryption, but you would still probably have lots of time, if you were aware of the risk, to move your coins to a safe address. Moreover, the Bitcoin developers and miners would rapidly shift to a new crytpographic signature system if such a weakness were found.) This applies to attack by quantum computers as well (~~wallets~~ addresses that have spent are vulnerable, ~~wallets~~ addresses that haven't are, at the least, massively safer, if not fully safe).

I disagree. I think a lot rests on finding the right case. That is, a case in which someone uses a mixing service to donate money to a controversial political group, say, because he or she faced possible repercussions from his/her employer, for instance, or a similar situation in which someone had a fully legitimate reason to use a mixer.
By the way, you're thinking about Bitcoin as if it's just like other financial institutions, when it's not. The Bitcoin ledger is public, meaning anyone can see anyone else's transactions. Contrast that with banks, where only the bank itself has control of (and hence access to) customer records. In the scenario above, the person can simply make a donation via the ordinary financial system, and because of privacy laws, the employer will (or should, anyway) never see it. However, with a public ledger, there is a definite risk that an employer (or other interested party) might examine one's transactions, so there is a real, legitimate need for a mechanism to provide financial privacy to Bitcoin users.

Lowest fees are at Mtred (at  at 0% fee RBPPS + transaction fees. It isn't always up, however. You should investigate other pools by looking at the [mining pools section on  a ton of them, many with different rewards systems, and BTC Guild is definitely not charging the lowest fees, at 3% PPLNS (pay per last N shares, meaning that each block reward is divided up according to how many of the last N shares each worker contributed) and 5% PPS (pay per share, a flat fee paid for each share submitted).
I personally am fond of PPS and RBPPS (round-based pay-per-share, meaning you get a flat fee for each share but you have to wait until the block has 120 confirmations to get the coins), because they provide a steady payout with no real luck involved. I tried proportional systems like PPLNS and others, but I didn't like depending on the pool to be lucky.
If you're running GPUs, I recommend looking at [alternate cryptocurrencies]( some of which are more profitable for GPU miners, even in bitcoin terms, than mining bitcoins. (If you don't know what your scrypt speed is, look it up by checking out the [litecoin mining hardware comparison page.](

See, this is why communicating clearly is important, especially on the Internet. You asked for "one good regulation," as if to say that all regulations are bad. I sought to counter what I perceived to be your implied argument.
However, if you want to discuss regulation of Bitcoin, we certainly can. I would prefer that people who produce child pornography not be able to use our wonderful payment system to launder their ill-gotten funds. I don't believe that such a thing can be prevented without exchanges following anti-money-laundering regulations. As such, although I do disagree with some of the laws which feed into AML regulations (specifically, prohibition of drugs), I do not disagree with the existence of the regulations to begin with, and indeed I feel that they are good regulations, in the end.
Now, I do wish certain international ~~cartels~~ banks would face the wrath of the DOJ for violating the AML regulations, but sadly, that's an entirely different fight (and not one that's been going well).

If they don't go rogue, then the only risk is going down. At which point my argument about backup pools comes into play.

That was an immediate economic threat. Bitcoin isn't remotely close to being that dangerous (if it ever will be, something I tend to doubt, but for the sake of argument I'll assume it will be someday).
Governments are already working on tackling the dangers they do see Bitcoin creating, (primarily money laundering, at this point). What they aren't doing, and what they won't do, is try to destroy it because of what it might one day become (especially given that mainstream politicians likely find the idea of Bitcoin eventually threatening the financial system laughable, just as mainstream economists do). Politicians in the US have demonstrated that although they wish to regulate Bitcoin's use, they have no desire whatsoever to squash it (to the contrary, they want to ensure that they *don't* squash it and push the innovations it will spawn overseas).

Well look, I'm not trying to argue against the Canadian system. Hell, I'd love it if we could switch to the Canadian system. In fact, I don't think we disagree at all here. The point I was making about Medicare is that it is far superior to any private health insurer in the US.
Oh, and by the way, I don't think it's completely fair to compare Medicare directly to the Canadian system, because as you point out, we only insure seniors with Medicare. You would think this would make it cost less, but really it's just the opposite: by the time people are eligible for Medicare, they've been through 65 years of shitty health coverage, which in general negatively impacts their health. Beyond that, it costs more to care for seniors in general. Now, there are numerous other reasons why we spend more for medical care in the US, but I am certain that we would see significant improvements in cost if we were to enact "Medicare for everyone" (as was discussed and, to my great chagrin, rejected, during the debate over Obamacare). Not to mention that we would then have a single payer, allowing for greater bargaining power and a single platform on which to experiment with innovative ways of paying for care, both of which would bring down costs.

I said, the *laws against* rape. But if you wanted to get into it, yes, there are strict rules about what constitutes rape: many states still define rape as being "forcible," which generally means that if the victim doesn't fight back (and they generally don't), there's no case.
As for the chemicals, it has nothing to do with property and everything to do with public health. The regulations are not "additional rules" but rather the *only* rules (because if you believe basic moral imperatives matter to everyone, or even almost everyone, you're simply not living in the real world--humans are better at rationalizing immoral behavior than they are at just about anything else). They are indeed updated too infrequently, and they are indeed often useless. Neither of these is a reason to scrap them; rather, both are reasons why regulations need to be constantly updated and reworked for society to function optimally.

As the old adage goes (I'm probably paraphrasing), "The only secure computer is one not connected to any network or electricity, buried deep underground in a locked steel vault. And I'm not totally sure about that one."

I love how you used Bitcoin's eventual total of 21M for the calculation of the percentage Satoshi theoretically controls, but you're using the current total number of Litecoins (~23.5M) for your 10% figure (it'd be less than 3% if you use the eventual total of 84M). Consistency FTW!

Most Bitcoin enthusiasts are either tech geeks or libertarians (or both). I fall into the former category, so politically (as a liberal), I often feel a bit out of place. I'm used to it, of course, having gotten into Bitcoin mining in August 2011 (an odd time to start, I know, but it worked out pretty well for me, in the end), but I do sometimes wonder if I'm the only damn liberal who's into it.
Personally I feel that economic freedom can only be fully granted when there are no externalities not priced into the cost of goods and services. While oil companies can pollute groundwater and not pay the costs that the pollution ultimately incurs (in the form of higher health bills for the surrounding residents, primarily, but also in the depletion of the ability of the local environment to act as a sink for waste), oil will remain underpriced, and so no free market can arrive at the socially desirable level of oil usage (aka a lot lower than it is today, especially when you think about externalities like the cost of the hegemony required to secure US oil interests). Other examples include the health care costs due to antibiotic resistance that's worsened by the overuse of antibiotics in factory farming, the costs to society when workers are maimed or killed in unsafe working conditions and thus unable to live up to their full potential (not to mention, once again, any health care costs incurred), and the cost to society when workers don't earn enough to make a living on one job and instead have to have multiple jobs which prevent them from being sufficiently involved in their children's lives to help the children live up to their own full potential.
So to me, the market can be a powerful force for good, but only when the incentives drive the economy to perform the tasks that are most socially desirable, which requires regulation in one form or another. Regulation requires government, which requires taxation. Anarcho-capitalists claim that you can replace government functions using the private sector, but I see that as a largely cosmetic change (because you still ultimately have to pay for services rendered one way or another), and I worry about sacrificing the power of the vote and the accountability it can impose; how do ordinary working people address a wrong done to them by a large corporation in an industry with high barriers to entry?

The huge, actual problems were caused, in general, either by a total lack of regulation or by a lack of up-to-date regulation in the field of financial derivatives. When a mortgage company can sell a mortgage to Joe Borrower, then turn around and divide it up into securities to sell to investors in order to recoup its principal, suddenly that mortgage company doesn't have to care about whether or not Joe Borrower can actually pay back that money. This complete breakdown of economic incentives resulted in abuses at all levels, from borrowers lying about income to mortgage brokers getting people into loans they couldn't afford to Goldman Sachs selling mortgage-backed securities which were known to be garbage to investors.
The point is that regulations *have* to be up to date. If they're not, they'll not only potentially miss the new dangers that innovation has brought about (as we saw with the financial crisis), they also risk crushing positive innovations before they can get started (as we're seeing in the Bitcoin space). It's critical to have the correct regulatory balance to maintain economic stability while not undermining prosperity. (The problem is that many people can make a very large amount of money doing things that put stability at risk, and others have a vested interest in using overregulation to stifle competition, even if it hurts the overall economy.)

Not quite. What they do is completely drain the *inputs* that are being spent (because it's required; you can't leave an input half-spent) by sending change to an alternate address. The clients with the "don't use change addresses" option are still fully draining all inputs used, but the change is sent to the same address rather than a new one.

Clearly you didn't understand what I wrote. I made assumptions that were ridiculously unlikely (in fact, flat-out wrong) and showed that even so, the numbers are negligible.
The reality is that most of ASICMINER's weekly dividends still come from mining, and of the remainder from hardware sales, a lot comes from sales of the USB miners, which don't contribute as much hashing power per Bitcoin of sales.
So, the real number is a fraction of that, e.g. single digit amounts of TH/s added each week, if that. Which, given the increases we've seen, is negligible.

Two things:
1. You clearly do not understand the concept of an exponential function. Moore's law *must* hit a wall sometime in the next 100 years simply due to energy constraints (because there are hard limits to how little energy can be used to perform computational tasks). Keep in mind also that every doubling is *twice as hard as the last one*! That means 2^160 is not a bit more than twice 2^64 . No, 2^65.2 is more than twice 2^64 ; 2^160 is 79228162514264337593543950336 times more than 2^64 (!)
2. There will never be a time at which SHA-256 is the only thing protecting an address's coins. For one, addresses are RIPEMD160(SHA256(pubKey)), not just SHA256(pubKey) or even SHA256(SHA256(pubKey))--although from what I've read, this actually *reduces* the protection to 160 bits rather than 256. But more importantly, the developers will start moving to a new signature algorithm long before quantum computer attacks on Bitcoin addresses become even remotely feasible, so even during the transition, nobody's coins will actually be at risk.

Their billing server got hacked. Unless you were expecting to get 14.8 BTC, it's likely that your balance is just buggy, like most other people's.

You can read more about child sexual abuse if you're interested; there are tons of resources available on the psychology of it. From what I've read, a large portion of the damage caused by sexual abuse can result from the discovery of the abuse and the resulting investigations and prosecutions. The reason is fairly simple: the child didn't know that what the abuser did was inappropriate, and oftentimes they enjoy it (abusers tend to be very kind to their victims when they are abusing them, and nasty between incidents of abuse, leading the victim to look forward to the abuse; in addition, sexual activities are usually physically pleasurable, and abusers will often go out of their way to ensure that the victim experiences sexual pleasure).
As a result, when the abuse is discovered and the perpetrator is brought up on charges, the victim often doesn't understand what's happening, but the message is clear: what happened was bad. The problem is, the victim didn't feel that way, which often leads to victims hating themselves for going along with it.
Now, take all of these emotions, and pile onto them the fact that the images and video of the events are everywhere. Some victims feel like they are being violated all over again every time someone views these materials. It's hard enough for these people to testify in court against their abusers because testifying requires reliving the abuse, so it's almost unimaginable how painful it can be to have your abuse trumpeted to the world.

Trust me, it will start to become very clear in the not-too-distant future just how much of a selling point regulatory compliance is.

An exchange that has solid compliance policies in place will weather that storm without a problem, but a non-compliant may well get taken down.

For one, I find it amusing that you think bureaucrats aren't deciding the price of apples. Have you heard of the USDA? (I'm not even really supportive of farm subsidies, but you seem to be unaware that they exist.)
As for rural electrification, the point is that there are numerous areas that would have had to wait decades for power if we'd left it up to private industry, which was getting there, but too slowly. The government stepped in and provided a huge benefit to a very large number of people. This was ultimately in the collective interest, because the economies of those rural areas grew much faster thanks to the availability of electricity, generating tax revenues to make up for the expenditure necessary to electrify the areas to begin with. Moreover, the market still set the price of power, because the utilities had to set rates according to demand in order to pay off their capital investments in power plants. (Similarly, the market still sets the cost of sending mail; it's just averaged across all parcels so that your letter across town that doesn't cost much to deliver helps pay for the cost to deliver to Susie in North Dakota--and actually, it's junk mail that's keeping all of our costs down, as it happens.)
The market isn't as perfect as you seem to think. Sometimes it doesn't have very good foresight. Sometimes it just moves too slow and we need to provide public investment to speed the process. I'm not saying government is perfect, but how exactly do you think the Interstate Highway project, for instance, would have been accomplished if not for the US government? Or the Transcontinental Railroad? These things were done only because people in government had the foresight to devote public resources to projects that were in everyone's collective interest.

No. The danger is that you and Jim, the douchebag across the street, both found the same private key online and imported it into your wallets, and then you both just left it there and forgot about it.
The next week, you go to spend some Bitcoins. Since the default behavior is to send the "change" back to a fresh address, whatever part of the chosen input you don't spend will go to one of the other addresses in your wallet. Now, in this case, your client chooses as a change address the address you imported a week prior, which means that the change can be spent by anyone who imported the same key you did, including Jim.
So, you spend your coins and go back to doing whatever it is you do when you're not doing Bitcoin-related stuff. Then Jim hops online and notices that his Bitcoin balance has mysteriously gone up. He may not understand what happened, but he'll know that something weird is going on, and he wants to keep those coins, so he sends them to his default address (the one to which he receives all his coins). Since you don't have his default address in your wallet, it looks like your coins vanished into thin air (or, to be more accurate, into Jim's wallet, although you might not know that it's Jim's).

Then I read about mining. Within a few hours I had boned up on the basics of the protocol and moved on to intently studying the [mining hardware comparison page]( (which at the time only listed GPUs and CPUs). Fast forward two months and I had a rig running at school.
I do wish I had bought back all of the Bitcoins I sold demonstrating my trade bot project for a class, and then the ones I sold running it (it would have been moderately successful had I bought back all the BTC right after shutting the bot down, but alas, I didn't). That's about 27 BTC, for those keeping score at home. The price I sold them for? About $130 total.

You may still be able to get in without one, but not in a quick or smooth fashion. In fact, Canada only requires US passports *because* the US does. As for Mexico, it seems you don't need a passport specifically but rather a document certifying permanent residence in the US, and you may not need to present it unless you go more than 20 km into Mexico.

No, because a D-Wave is not a "gate" quantum computer, according to the article you source.

Guilt by association!


And it still is, because no one is being forced to use this new protocol. You can just use regular old Bitcoin if you want. This is just a new feature.


Only merchants need to do this, and again, only if they want to use the protocol.
The whole point is to make the user experience smoother and easier, because right now copy/pasting an address is a clumsy process. This allows merchants to use some of the same technologies they already use to make requests for payment, and provide acknowledgement of payment, in Bitcoin, and it allows users to securely pay *people* rather than *addresses*, which is more intuitive. Hence, this protocol will make adopting Bitcoin easier for both customers and merchants.
But even if you disagree with me about the above, there's no need to get so worked up, because **this protocol is not mandatory.**

You have two layers of encryption, which is good, but you have a few weaknesses:
1. Passwords: How good are the passwords you're using? If they're made up mostly or entirely of dictionary words, you should be using at least four words. Ideally you're not using coherent phrases, as they're harder to guess, but a sufficiently long coherent phrase (so long as it hasn't been published anywhere) should be fine. If you're not using dictionary words (i.e., your password is just a bunch of letters, numbers, and/or symbols), then as long as it's either truly randomly generated (MUCH better), or it's at least not keyboard-pattern-based (believe it or not, such passwords are crackable), you should be OK.
2. Endpoint security: Your computer is vulnerable to hacking. Pretty much any computer connected to the Internet can be hacked. Most already have been, essentially, in the form of viruses, Trojans, and malware, some of which may be logging your every keystroke to send to someone. Some malware mines bitcoins on the host computer, other malware looks for wallet.dat files (and probably also logs keystrokes to catch encryption passwords like yours). If you're using a Windows machine, especially if it's XP, you are a lot more vulnerable than if you're running one of the newer versions of Windows, which in turn are more vulnerable than Mac OS X-based systems, which in turn are more vulnerable than Linux-based systems (and I think BSD fits about here with Linux in terms of vulnerability), but note that **no operating system is entirely secure; they ALL have vulnerabilities, and this is unlikely to change for the foreseeable future.**
3. Lack of two-factor authentication: If someone gets your encrypted file plus your passwords, they get your coins. Forever. There's nothing else in an attacker's way. As mentioned by OP, the standard Bitcoin client (Bitcoin-qt) does not support two-factor authentication, but some wallet services do, and Bitcoin-qt will support two-factor eventually.
You're not at high risk of losing your wallet data, but you still could, so you might consider buying a few external hard drives and backing it up on each of them.
**How you can improve your security:**
1. The best way: Cold storage on a paper wallet. You can make a paper wallet using an offline copy of bitcoinpaperwallet.org, ideally on a computer that's never been connected to the Internet (use a USB stick to transfer the web page over). If you're really, really paranoid, you can use hexadecimal dice (they're apparently available on Amazon) and see [here]( for information on using them to generate a private key and an address. (**Be warned that due to the way most Bitcoin clients work, you will almost certainly need to create a new paper wallet every time you spend any coins out of your current one, because any extra coins (that you aren't spending) will be transferred to a "change" address**, and also because placing the private key on a computer that is connected to the Internet and spending Bitcoins from an address both serve to reduce the security of the paper wallet, the latter because you reveal your public key to the world when you do so.) You can also use [this utility]( (written by Mike Caldwell of Casascius physical Bitcoin fame) to generate addresses and the associated private keys, and it supports encrypting the private key against a provided passphrase and even supplies you with the QR code image for the encrypted private key. (If you prefer to download the source code to review and build yourself, it can be found [here]( If you don't encrypt the private key before making the paper wallet, then this method is only as secure as the location where the paper wallet resides (in other words, if someone steals an unencrypted paper wallet, your coins are GONE.)
2. A less-good way that's still probably more secure than what you have: Get a wallet at blockchain.info, and set up two-factor authentication. Use a long passphrase, ideally 10+ words randomly generated via [DiceWare]( (a system whereby you roll dice and use the results to generate a random multiword passphrase) or, if you prefer the lazy and less-paranoid way, [this page]( which can be saved and used offline (passphrases generated here only require 9 words for similar security to 10-word DiceWare passwords--unless of course the random number generator is somehow compromised). I'd also suggest using [KeyScrambler]( which might not save you from keyloggers, but also might just do the trick.
3. An even less-good way that's *still* probably better than what you have (assuming you run Windows): Add a Linux install to your computer (making it a dual-boot system) which you use **only** for Bitcoin transactions. Make sure you have *lots* of space available for it if you plan to run a full client, since the blockchain isn't getting any smaller! This can be easily accomplished using Ubuntu's [Wubi]( utility if you are running Windows and have a stock PC (i.e., not custom-built, or if custom-built, at least not out of uncommon-brand hardware). You can use your existing wallet here, if you prefer, or create a new one with a new passphrase (since you probably don't know for sure that your computer doesn't have a keylogger on it right now).

If you're willing to put in the effort to learn about mining and Bitcoin and how it all works, and you're aware of the risks involved in getting into the game now, and you still really want to get into mining, then there are two good options for your $20k:
1. Get a 2 TH/s, 1100W CoinTerra rig. These cost $13,999 and are supposed to ship in December. It's not clear whether or not they will actually produce a product, let alone on the schedule they're predicting, but they do appear to have some real talent on their team, so it does seem relatively legit (but that still doesn't mean they'll ship on time, as we've seen with BFL).
2. Get 4 of BFL's 600 GH/s, 350W Monarch PCI-e cards at a cost of $4,680 each or $18,720 (you might even build an old-style GPU rig with them!). They are supposed to ship in February or so if you order now, and BFL insists that they will actually match their shipping, power, and efficiency claims this time because they've got real-world experience now. Take that for what you will. I would expect them to actually produce a product, but whether it will meet the specs or the shipping deadlines is anyone's guess.
The other risk involved is the difficulty. CoinTerra has pledged to add 2000 TH/s to the network in December, BFL appears to be working on pushing the current total to 1500+ TH/s by the time they finish shipping (they're saying end of September for that, at the moment), KnC is supposed to deliver 500-2000 TH/s in October and November, and Avalon may add as much as 320 TH/s themselves in the very near term. Then there's Bitfury, which apparently will be shipping another 500 TH/s in the coming months, and ASICMINER, whose hardware sales are negligible but whose in-house mining operation probably won't be once they get their 2nd-gen chips running. It's unclear how much ASICMINER expects to add (there's a common misquote of friedcat saying they will ramp up to 1000 TH/s themselves by the end of the year, but I believe he was saying he thought the network would be at that level then), but they won't ever account for more than 25% of the network, and probably much less.
Also, here are some useful equations:
Difficulty = (TotalHashrate * 600) / 2^32
(where TotalHashrate is the total network hashrate in hashes per second)
Difficulty1SharesPerDay = (Hashrate * 86400) / 2^32
(where hashrate is your hashrate in hashes per second)
AvgBitcoinsPerDay = (Difficulty1SharesPerDay / Difficulty) * (25 * (1 - fee))
(where fee is the pool fee, expressed as a decimal, e.g. 3% would be 0.03)

You should expect difficulty to eventually rise (or fall, if necessary) to the point at which mining is just about break-even on cheap power.
So, the efficiency matters a lot in terms of the end-game profitability.
@_date: 2013-09-05 17:22:10
Even that isn't the way it works, as it happens. The target is set based on how long it took to find 2016 blocks since the last retarget. At some point in time, the hashrate had to actually be at that level, but the difficulty is not set to match the hashrate at the exact moment that the 2016th block is found.
I provided that equation so people can see what the mathematical relationship between difficulty and network hashrate is, and so they can project what difficulty would be at a given hashrate.

The "Chasm" is the region wherein a new technology has to shift from appealing to early adopters, who are willing to take up a new technology even though it has some challenges or quirks, or requires technical sophistication to use (or use properly) to appealing to the early majority, which is much more demanding and less willing to accept such flaws in a technology. The struggle to make this leap has been dubbed the "chasm," and it is a product of both the tension between the aims of the early adopters vs the early majority and also of the difficulty in maintaining momentum while trying to iron out the kinks in order to reach a wider userbase.
So actually, I think we may be at or in the chasm, given Bitcoin's current situation.

Freicoin is actually quite interesting. It's got more than inflation built in (like I said, that would just require a constant block reward); it has what might be termed "entropy" built in. It's based on a fascinating [economic experiment]( done in Austria during the Depression, which was successful in jump-starting the economy of the town of Worgl, Austria. The experiment was shut down, unsurprisingly, by the Austrian National Bank, which didn't take kindly to an alternative currency being minted.
Such a system, by penalizing hoarders, forces the money to move as fast as possible through the economy. The problem is that in order to jump-start such a system, you need to provide a preset exchange rate  initially. Freicoin has some kind of foundation giving them away, but without forcing people to trade some other currency (one with some actual value) to get it, the currency is not imbued with the value necessary to make it work.
That said, I'm hopeful that Freicoin takes off and makes me look foolish for saying the above, because I think it would offer an excellent means of exchange to complement Bitcoin's store of value.

Wow, the first comments are from people whining about them not using PGP and saying SSL is broken? I love how neither of them bother to actually take on the points Mike Hearn actually made on these very issues, and choose instead to make the same tired complaints.
Look, people, SSL is what *everyone* uses. No, it's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination. But doing this only with PGP support would be a total waste of time, because the people who already use PGP are not the types of people that need this protocol. If you want to use PGP, you can download the source code and add support for it in this protocol instead of whining, but I don't see why it's necessary--if you use PGP already, you're probably capable of copy/pasting a Bitcoin address and checking it to ensure it wasn't altered in transit somehow.

My comments here are based in real-life experience mining at various pools. Luck was a big factor, and it's what led me to move to a PPS pool.
I understand your math just fine, and I could probably prove it myself if I had to--I did take discrete in school.
Moreover, I never said PPS was *bad* for p2pool; just that I prefer steady payouts to the risk of a proportional/PPLNS/DGM/other non-PPS reward system. Mining pools (the miners in them, not the operators) are not in competition with one another in any real sense, because every pool accomplishes the most basic goal: reduce variance due to luck to the point where everybody gets roughly the same portion of the total bitcoins generated as his or her hashing power represents on the network. Some of us just prefer to eliminate variance altogether.
@_date: 2013-07-31 17:17:15


I don't know how they intended this wording to work, but I can say categorically that miners **do not** accept and then transmit any currency. We do not control the currency within the transactions being confirmed, and hence we do not transmit money. Note that I apply this reasoning to *all* miners--including pool operators. None of them ever have the ability to control where the currency goes, which means that none of them ever "accepts and transmits" anything.
In addition, miners *do not* create Bitcoins. Miners are rewarded with new Bitcoins, created by the *protocol*, upon the discovery of a block. However, until that block is confirmed by the rest of the network, no one receives anything, so it is clear that miners are not "creating" the coins.

And this is different from Social Security numbers, bank account numbers, and credit card numbers how? (Aside from the fact that all of them must, at some point, be transmitted over the internet and are therefore in many ways more vulnerable to theft than a Bitcoin wallet is.)
If we're assuming that a user's computer is compromised to the point where the attacker is keylogging and capable of grabbing files from the HDD, then we can also safely assume that nothing on that computer is safe. Bitcoins are only one of the things that a computer can store that are worth stealing; there are numerous others.

If you want to mine instead of just doing boring speculation by buying Bitcoins, KnCMiner or BitFury are really the only good options at this point.
In mining hardware right now, you don't want to pay much more than $20 per GH/s. If you do the math, ASICMINER USB sticks are ~3 BTC ($225) per GH/s, the newly-announced Blades are ~2 BTC ($150) per GH/s, a fully-assembled TerraHash unit (currently out of stock) would cost ~$58 per GH/s, BFL's hardware is between $44 and $55 per GH/s, KnCMiner's hardware is between $17.50 and $19 per GH/s, and BitFury's 120 GH/s rigs are $18 per GH/s.
So if you're buying hardware, I'd stick to either KnCMiner or BitFury, and BitFury isn't shipping outside Europe AFAIK (although you can pick them up in Moscow, if you're up for a trip to Russia).

I realize this isn't a terribly popular view on here, now or ever, but it sounds to me like you're trying to solve a human problem with a machine solution. As a software engineer myself, I have to say that that doesn't work very often. Personally, I think people here overestimate the impact Bitcoin itself is likely to have, even as they fail to see which aspects are most revolutionary. (Fixed supply? Yawn. Instant secure transfer of funds--*or other assets*--with the ability to programmatically enforce contracts? Wow!)
I don't see how we can fix this by any non-political means. Americans have grown deeply cynical about politics lately, but that's largely, in my view, because we lack the right politicians (or even the right political parties, perhaps); that is, we lack politicians who are willing to tap into the deep wellspring of dissatisfaction among ordinary people in this country. I and many others thought we had found that in Obama, but we were wrong. After his administration's abysmal failure in making clear the benefits of the stimulus bill and wasting his remaining political capital on passing the health care plan Republicans were advocating in 1993 (a virtual carbon copy of which Romney himself passed in Massachusetts), he settled in to become a mediocre politician, and one who has allowed the national security state to whittle away our civil liberties faster than even his predecessor did.
I also don't think we would enjoy the aftermath if the current system were to collapse. It didn't work out very well for the French Revolution, high-minded rhetoric notwithstanding. It's very easy to call for an end to the big bad government from the safety and comfort of a climate-controlled, furnished home well-stocked with fresh food, with the protection of law enforcement, firefighters, and ambulances ready to respond to a phone call of distress if needed (not that they're perfect, but they do a good job preventing roving bands of marauders from burning, raping, pillaging, and such, not to mention the keeping-people-alive part).

I expect that the rise of quantum computers will force the Bitcoin network to update both its hashing and signature algorithms, rather than leading to mining via quantum computers (which just seems silly when you think about it; as soon as you hit a full 256 qubits, you can solve the problem almost instantaneously).

Not true; this might hold for proof-of-stake systems, but to take over Bitcoin, you'd need 50% + 1h/s of network hashing power. Now, I highly doubt the dollar value of all hardware currently mining Bitcoins even tops $500M (and it's probably nowhere near that, in fact), meaning that you're still correct that a nation-state could easily perform such an attack, but the distinction is critical.

Yes, but remember that you need to track down all of your change addresses too, and I'm not sure if all of them will be listed under "Receive Coins". But I have to go spend some of my own BTC right now anyway, so I'll have a look and let you know. If they're not listed there, you'll need to explore the blockchain like I explained previously.

That's not what I meant. I acknowledge that what you're describing happens depressingly often, but I was pointing out that most of us don't believe in the idea that regulation can be carried out by an entity that is not a government. I'd be interested to know how you expect regulation to occur, if it's not performed by a government.
See, most of us would say that the solution to the problem you're describing is to crack down on political corruption in this country and make the government more responsive to the people, not eliminate the system altogether. I personally look at Somalia and the French Revolution and find myself wanting no part of a successful domestic revolution (note that the American Revolution was not a domestic revolution because it overthrew a foreign power).

Keeping the coins would present a very real incentive to give glowing reviews to BFL in exchange for being sent a money-printing machine.

That's because it's definitely going to pay itself off. People here are anti-mining because they don't run the numbers for themselves; they just use calculators that assume the difficulty will indefinitely keep rising exponentially, when in fact what will happen is going to look more like an S-curve. I've run the numbers for myself, and I'm not the least bit worried about the skyrocketing difficulty, despite the fact that my first BFL order (my smallest one) is pay-dated 12/12/12.

No, that's the beauty of using [Merkle Trees]( miners only need to include one hash that represents all of the included transactions.
It's Bitcoin nodes that suffer from transaction spam (and for anyone to mine, at least one person has to run a node in order to collect transactions, so the two are linked, but you can run as many mining rigs off of one node as you want, and without having to transmit lots of data back and forth between the miners and the node, as pools demonstrate).
Nodes are the ones keeping the UTXO set (that's the Unspent TransaXction Output set), though not in memory--it's kept on the local hard drive as a database. As such, maintaining a Bitcoin node requires quite a bit of bandwidth and hard drive storage capacity, to the point that it's rather inconvenient for ordinary users now to use the main client (Bitcoin-Qt, which runs a full node, and thus has to download the entire blockchain and keep a copy of the UTXO set handy).

Things have value because people believe they have value. No other reason.

Ah, but he clearly hasn't thought through the implications! If everyone else's mining equipment is down, then this guy performs an accidental, automatic 51% attack (sort of)! Which means that trust in Bitcoin will totally be undermined, and no one will accept them anymore!
That's right: none of the twisted, deformed mutants roaming the remains of civilization will accept Bitcoins. Because they won't trust a network with only one centralized miner. Duh!

How many poor people do you think have any stashes of fiat currency? (The correct answer is, basically none; the poor have a negative savings rate.) Moreover, if you've been in poverty, you know that it's extremely difficult to avoid getting into debt, and oftentimes damn near impossible to get out of it once you do.
And the wealthy absolutely are holding large amounts of fiat currency, given that all of the financial instruments available to them are denominated in it.
Inflation forces people to use their money, lest it lose value, which is a good thing in a general economy. I know this isn't a popular view here, but it's been shown to be true [in the past](
Note that I don't think this makes Bitcoin useless (though I do disagree with those that expect it to destroy banking/fiat currency/the nation-state/the welfare state/etc), just that I don't expect it to change the reality of wealth inequality, which remains a problem.

100k^4 = (10^5 )^4 = 10^20
At a billion guesses per second, you'll need 10^11 seconds.
10^11 s / (86,400 s/day) = ~1,157,407 days
~1,157,407 days / (365 days/yr) = ~3,170 years.
Even if the attacker can do 50 billion guesses per second, that's still over 63 years. Unless you're Satoshi himself, I don't think you need to be worried about an attacker *that* determined.
(And adding just one more word pushes an attack well beyond this level of unlikelihood and into the realm of practical impossibility.)

Both of these serve only to compound the risk he took and make it more likely that he will lose all of his money. I don't think either one is a good idea. Personally, I think he should cash out every penny he can get out of the Single and hope it works out.

This isn't true either. Savings accounts bear interest, which in general serves to offset the cost of inflationary devaluation. It's not like your only option with fiat money is to keep it under your mattress.
I know people here don't like the Fed, but its job is to keep inflation under control, and so far, Bernanke has done just fine at that. Not so much on keeping employment up, though.
Note that to be considered a rebuttal worthy of response, you must provide a *reputable*, widely-accepted source which states that inflation has been above 3% for more than one of the past four years.

If you don't want to work with the government, it will fight you.
Now, many people think that the government can't shut Bitcoin down. This is not true. What the government cannot do is *ban* Bitcoin, because it is decentralized. But the NSA runs its own chip fab facility, and if they wanted to, they could churn out enough ASIC miners in the next year to be assured of having 51+% of the network hashrate for years to come. And then they can do whatever they like to undermine the network, most notably *not letting any transactions into the blockchain*. Sure, we could change the hashing algorithm--but then no one but the NSA will have any ASICs, because they can just start building new ones the very next day, whereas we can't.
If we try to fight the US government head on, we will lose. It's as simple as that.

At 0.5W per GH/s, $94/BTC, and difficulty 15B, you'd need to be paying less than ~$0.1267/kWh to make any profit at all. If you were paying only $0.02/kWh (an absurdly low rate), you'd still only be netting ~$0.0012 per GH/s per day. That means a 400 GH/s miner would be netting $0.51 per day *for those with rock-bottom electricity rates*. Currently, such hardware costs upwards of $7000, meaning that even in such a situation, breaking even would take roughly 37.4 years. To bring the break-even period down to two years (which, one year from now, translates to "the amount of time left before the next halving"), the exchange rate would have to reach ~$1,760. **Even if the efficiency rose to infinity (that is, 0W per GH/s), to break even in two years the exchange rate would have to reach ~$1,482, or the price of 400 GH/s would have to drop to less than $444, or some equivalent combination of increased exchange rates and decreased hardware costs.**
So, I guarantee the difficulty will be nowhere near 15 billion in one year, unless, as Julian702 says, the exchange rate is extremely high at that point.

I'm at work and can't take the time to watch the video, but from what I can tell, his argument is: "Look, this guy had 25% of network hashing power on a tray a while ago! Also, governments have lots of money they could use to build ASICs! That means we need to scrap SHA256!"
Now, if I'm missing part of his argument, please correct me. But if I'm not, it's a terrible argument.
For one, although I myself have been pointing out today that governments have the capacity to build 51% of hashing power and use it to destroy Bitcoin, I do not believe that such an event is likely to come to pass anytime soon, if ever. (I raised the point in order to argue that Bitcoiners need to win government over rather than try to fight it.)
For another, ASICs are being produced commercially, and are becoming more and more widely-available. As such, the disproportionate amount of hashing power Yifu held on a tray a while back is really little different from what ATI had in warehouses in early 2010 (the primary difference being that ATI had no interest in mining Bitcoins), because those GPUs represented at least as large a portion of the pre-GPU Bitcoin network as Yifu's chips did of the post-FPGA network more recently.

The comment you're replying to is wrong. An oracle is an authority with its own keypair, which signs a transaction if a particular function, established ahead of time, evaluates to true. Once the signed transaction is broadcast to the network, it cannot be revoked. Once a transaction is included in the blockchain, it cannot be taken back or reversed.
No, you can use an oracle to do escrow, where the buyer sends funds to a special transaction that can only be spent by a transaction signed by two of three addresses among the buyer's address, the oracle's address, and the seller's address. In the event of a dispute, the oracle can step in and provide the tie-breaking vote in favor of the side it determines to be in the right.
Now, there are issues with this (trust required in an oracle being one), but I'd rather not get into them here. [Here's the wiki page on contracts]( for those who want more information.
