As a business owner, landlord, and freelance IT consultant, I do have a pretty good idea what happens when people pay for my services. 
For something to be considered a currency it needs to be a store of value, unit of accounting, and medium of exchange. 
If someone were to pay me with bitcoin (and oddly enough, I do get paid in BTC once in a great while), do you know what I do with it?  I either hodl or spend it as BTC.  This is the medium of exchange part of the definition of currency.  When you sell a currency for another currency, it is not a medium of exchange. When you buy something with it, regardless of what the next person in the chain does with it, it is now a medium of exchange.  
Bitcoin doesn't have any challenges with the store of value part of currency. It has problems with unit of accounting and medium of exchange.  For those issues to be resolved it needs to be spent, not sold.  Therein lies the difference between spending and selling.

I'm sure he means sell for fiat. 
Selling it in trade for goods and services is a bit different than selling it for another currency.

The Nobel Peace Prize is a hell of a lot different than the Nobel Prize in Economics.  
The Peace Prize is given out under questionable circumstances (Like Obama and Arafat) often.  The one in Economics really isn't.
I'm not a massive fan of Krugman either, but the blind hate of him I see in some subs is just astounding.

That IS the [Nobel Prize in Economics](  He won it for his work in New Trade Theory.

Please don't do this. 
Your savings is there to carry you through unexpected hardship, and to give you the freedom to tell a job you hate to get stuffed. 
Savings should be in the most liquid and low risk account possible. Bitcoin is currency speculation, not a place that anyone should be putting their savings until its price stabilizes long term. 
If you're going to do anything, divert some of your investment money to BTC. Lower your 401k contribution, buy less individual equities, etc. Just please don't bet your savings on BTC.

Is there any way to integrate a hardware wallet with Mint? Coinbase does nicely, and it's really important to me to have all of my assets presented in my portfolio together.

Out of curiosity, have you listened to him speak at economics conferences, or lecture on a purely economic topic?  Or is your exposure to him limited to NYT and his blogging?
I will be the first to agree that his NYT and Slate writing is very partisan, but his tone when speaking on Economics is actually fairly balanced.  I will link a few examples below.
 (Talk on the future of Europe and the Euro, a thing he accurately predicted would come with huge problems)

Do you then just manually update it periodically?  My house and car automatically pull from zillow and kbb to estimate prices day to day.  The nice thing about coinbase is it integrates and updates day to day as well.

Why would it be any different than current, under the table cash transactions (which make up a tiny portion of labor)?  Why would there not be a system where employers paid direct deposit to your wallet, but not before withholding the proper amounts and sending it to the govt in BTC?

Except, you know, winning the Nobel prize.

Big statement.  Any source, or explanation other than just your personal intuition?

If you are a bitcoin millionaire right now, you probably have total gains in the 1000%+ range.  Paying 15-20% of that to Uncle Sam isn't the worst thing in the world. 
You live here, drive on the streets, enjoy the clean air, camp in the parks, fly in the safe planes, and send your kids to the schools.  Pay your taxes.
.......but don't pay more taxes than you're required to.  Hire an accountant to figure out what that number is.

Emergency fund after paying off all debt?  Yowzas!

Even if it's just a piece of paper, I absolutely do not want anything to do with storing and protecting a 30 lbs bar of gold worth half a mil on my own.  That shit is going into a safety deposit box (in exchange for a piece of paper), at the very minimum.  If I were really crazy, I guess I would find a place way out in the woods to bury it deep in the ground, and then write down the coordinates and depth on....... *a piece of paper.*

Ok, so let's put this into terms of reality.  In reality, an equivalent amount of fiat could be argued to be "a piece of paper that promises you a bar of gold".  A bar of gold is 438.9 troy oz, and gold is currently $1291.72 per troy oz.
With all of the above assumptions, the question is really this: "Would you rather have a bar of gold, or $566,992.97 in USD fiat?"
Give me the money every single time.
