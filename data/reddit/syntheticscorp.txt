All you need is a QR Code with your payment address. Sell the house 'like usual', but add the asking price in bitcoin too. You'll need a slightly different contract, that states you want the money in bitcoin and you should print in that contract the payment address.

The problem is that you are handling their keys. It somewhat defeats the purpose. Your best option at this point would be something on the notes of a paper wallet.
@_date: 2019-03-09 04:31:10
Yes... just like it's illegal to grab music from bittorrent... It's simpler than you think. Think about EtherDelta, they made it illegal to operate a coin exchange without KYC, EtherDelta wasn't doing KYC, or maybe it was about ICOs, and in that case it was illegal to have security tokens for non accredited investors, don't remember, but the point is look what happened. Once you make it illegal you can hit hard businesses, and without businesses there's no commerce, and without commerce your coins are worth nothing.

I would call that system a direct replacement for paper wallets. You use and keep the stick safe as if it was a paper wallet. The stick stores the system and the keys. But there is no need to print anymore. It will give all the QR codes you need.

Just because crypto is currency, it doesn't mean bankers and investors have any clue about the technology, its function and purpose. Why do we listen to people with no knowledge whatsoever about this topic is troubling. How much time did you spend learning about bitcoin? I can guarantee you, much much more than Warren Buffet.

Once you manage to put it on a stick, it boots your pc, it takes over and you are sealed from the outside world. Even if your pc is compromised, it doesn't matter. Inside there is a simple interface to generate and manage your wallets. U can clone wallets from usb to usb, and the entropy generator, which would be the only way to cheat the system, is in Javascript therefore verifiable, and cryptographically strong.

@_date: 2019-03-09 01:04:42
If the recipient address is 3DGM... exactly as in the picture, yes you sent it and you can always create a proof of payment through a signature with your wallet app. The most important thing to look for is a match in between the transaction in your app, and the website. If they are identical, you are good. If they are not identical, post the difference.

In the States it's all bad laws LOL. Remember 2008. We can unleash a whole lot of damage to the world wide economy, we do it once every \~10 years so we are due... If bitcoin was made illegal in the US, which is not what I'm saying, but if such blasphemy would happen, you would feel it in your exchange,, but the biggest problem is always rate of adoption, you speak of VPNs through Switzerland and stuff, how my grandma is supposed to do that. OH I just remembered... we had Snowden muahahaha, you have GDRP to protect you, we have NSA collecting every single possible thing in and out up and down, left and right, of citizens and not.

@_date: 2019-03-09 20:40:40
I don't see why KYC needs to exist. 1/3 of the planet is not banked because too poor to participate. At least 1/3 of the planet doesn't really care of KYC. KYC is just governments dictating who can participate in the economy. And guess what, it's always the poor who can't. Cryptos free us from this kind of discriminations and they need to be protected. There's no trace of KYC in a cryptocurrency code, which means it's not necessary for it to function. There's no concept of 'person' at all.
@_date: 2019-03-09 04:51:01
You need to separate legal / technical. I'm not talking about its implementation. THAT would be impossible, but making math illegal... that is [done all the time]( For encryption ( backdoors ) there is a STRONG rejection from many big names and organizations, encryption is part of a bigger discussion about Privacy as a fundamental human right. It's not made a law because democracy. Hopefully we will never see a law about enforced KYC for wallets, but it is a real possibility. FBI vs Apple, thank god Apple won about encryption in the San Bernardino case, as Tim Cook said, they wanted the computer equivalent of cancer. Wallet with KYC would be another equivalent of cancer. But it's real. My point is that we need to be aware and fight these things when they arise because, as you all pointed out, it's ridiculous and unenforceable, but lawmakers are usually old farts that don't understand much. The problem arises from bad laws.

If your local government outlaws wallets without KYC, because of ignorance of course, but if does it... Then all wallets would have KYC or you are a criminal. Most of cryptos are immune to such things by design and purpose, but wallets with KYC enforcement are a scary, viable possibility without an exchange, just because the law says so.

1 - Certain coins are more anonymous than others. It is part of the coin design. Coins like Bitcoin or Ethereum are traceable. Their transactions are visible in the blockchain.
Coins like Monero or Zcash are focused on privacy, and no one but you can see anything about your transactions. View keys can be provided in cases like audits, but the default position is 'hidden'. These are the coins you want to increase anonymity.
2 - If you buy coins from an exchange, you will probably need some ID. This case de-anonymizes you because your identity is now tied up to at least 1 transaction stored in a blockchain. If you plan to stay anonymous, buying from an exchange could be problematic. Deal locally, instead of buying, start accepting it, and rate of adoption goes up.
3 - If your location is also something you want anonymize, there are technologies like TOR that help you achieve the goal of anonymity.
Downloading a blockchain, or in other words, running a full node, doesn't improve anonymity. You have a copy of the blockchain that is independently verified by your node, it adds security while keeping the network strong.

We are used to receipts from the seller as proof of transaction. With Bitcoin, the sender can always produce a receipt without interacting with the seller. It is done through a signature, signed with the same private keys used in the transaction. This creates an inequivocabile proof that the sender has the proper private keys, therefore he also sent that money. Some, ( or most ? ) exchanges have what is called a custodial wallet. You don't have access to the private keys, which means you don't technically own that coins. Avoid custodial wallets at all costs when paying or getting paid.

@_date: 2019-03-10 05:06:06
You, not because it's you. But who holds the keys holds the coins. You had the keys at some point. Of course you wouldn't rob them, but technically, your nephews should handle their own keys. In your case generate the keys securely, make 2 or 3 copies, give them 1 and keep 1 in case they lose it. Once they figure out how to do it, they will sweep the wallet and both copies of the keys will become trash.
@_date: 2019-03-09 03:00:04
It will not prevent you from using bitcoin, that's impossible without turning off the internet. It will make you a criminal. And you won't be able to use that wallet at future Walmart because your wallet is not Government Approved. Of course if you and me want to transact in bitcoin, we don't care about using Approved Software and no one can stop us, but it would grind things almost to a halt because of its legal ramifications. All legitimate businesses would have to obey that law.
@_date: 2019-03-09 01:28:36
I agree. KYC requires your private, very private data. Parental controls apply filters that don't usually depend and collect your identity and financial information. KYC is meant to discriminate, not to protect.

Delete the wallet entry in your app and start from the beginning. Your coins are safe in the blockchain.
@_date: 2019-03-09 09:03:05
That's very true. It happened already. One big advantage of a cryptocurrency is that we don't need the data silos that get hacked anymore. It is designed to operate without any of that. KYC brings old ways into a new system and it's bad.

One thing is having bitcoin, which doesn't require any ID. Another thing is obtaining bitcoin. If you want to buy them from Euros, you must deal locally which can be a problem because opens the door for shady people.

Well with illegal downloads I think they just gave up after a long pointless battle, they understood at some point that you can't stop a peer to peer network and with the emergence of streaming services it's way more convenient to subscribe to a couple of them for your media needs.
But drugs have actual value, drugs do the job, a coin that can't be spent has no value because 'modern currencies' have only transactional value, not intrinsic value, unlike drugs. But yes, the coin wouldn't go to 0, many would just go through the KYC procedures. I'm painting a nightmare scenario to scare everyone.

If you want Bitcoins from any medium that handles dollars, you must pass through an exchange or deal locally. Try selling the gift card for either cash, or bitcoin directly. I think there are websites that do gift cards / bitcoin trades. Maybe you can use the same bank account for PayPal and an exchange account. Redeem the gift card, send it to the bank from PayPal, and exchange it for Bitcoin from the exchange account. For this to work, PayPal must allow the gift card to be redeemed for real withdrawable money.

I don't think they are using a blockchain at all if that happened ...I just checked, Petro is supposed to be a Dash clone, so your funds should be available to you. Just use the wallet you were using. As long as it's mined, it will work. Maybe that outages are the government mining Petro.

KNOW YOUR CUSTOMER. In order to exchange fiat for coins, and lately coins for coins, the exchange / service will require you to send a valid ID and other documents to verify your identity. This goes against the principles of a cryptocurrency and all services of that nature should be boycotted.
@_date: 2019-03-10 01:19:35
Mixers are good and mitigate the problem, but traceability remains, and there are service fees in wallets like Wasabi.
If Bitcoin is used with this, if Bitcoin is used with that... and if my grandma had wheels... Bitcoin doesn't do it on its own, you are mixing services with coins. I'm comparing coins. I put down the basics to understand where anonymity is at play. Add-ons and wallets services are another story.
