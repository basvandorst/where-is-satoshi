That's not FUD. You're delusional. This 1MB anti-scaling nonsense completely breaks Bitcoin.
Oh and before you call me a "new account" shill bringing FUD, here's a message signed with an address I last used in 2013:

Look into "the other Bitcoin" if you actually want a functional currency. Or don't - I'm not your mum.

Just for clarity: Do you consider it a complete failure if even a single user stays on the "old" (unchanged consensus) chain? Do we really need eternal compatibility with outdated clients?


If we define a hardfork as "a change to the bitcoin protocol that makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid" it has happened various times. If they gain minority hashrate/adoption you *could* call it an altcoin but it's technically still a hardfork.
If I'm missing a crucial piece of understanding here I'd be very happy to be enlightened. :)

You are presenting opinion as fact. Hardforks don't "fail entirely" without 100% adoption overnight. Even a minority hardfork can survive just fine. (Replay protection is a factor here.)
You could claim that it's a higher risk move because you could end up splitting the network - but all the scaling issues have already caused a split of the network so I'd say that's a moot point by now.

I can guarantee you that if that were to happen the original/old chain would still have economic usage thus making the hardfork a failure in your words.
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:33:23
That is by no means everyone's definition of "successful hardfork".

The age of my reddit account is irrelevant, I've been involved in this space long enough to know what I'm talking about. You are free to disagree with my vision but as long as I am not banned here I will express it - I'm always available for discussion regarding it.
The median transaction fee is currently around $20. Stating that this is unattractive for retail transactions is not FUD.

Do you know what currency is for?

You are truly beyond childish. Saddening.
