So the 'I told you it was a bubble' should happen soon, then we begin the normal climb again. Yay!

It's basically my end goal to hodl what's in that wallet to the moon, so hopefully by then it's our main form of currency and I'll be right lol.

Who cares wtf they are funding with it. It's like saying money isn't used to fuck kids and buy drugs and hitmen and fund terrorism every single fucking day anyway. Of course they are going to use it to fund hezbollah but it's no different then funding them with cash. If anything it will be good for bitcoins growth.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:41:34
Hmm you mean like how people earn money and hoard it? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:27:12
pretty sure we will be doing milestones in 10ks soon enough lol
@_date: 2019-07-01 03:31:00
I mean I probably should just claim it then I guess. I took out a substantial amount when it was at 20k but since then only use it sparingly off the coinjar card as I'm trying to hodl as much as I can. I'm sitting on a decent amount in a Trezor wallet aswell but unless I convert that I should be fine yeah?
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:06:18
thanks i'll look into it. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:22:47
yeah these same people also have no fucking clue what fiat currency is or how it works, and that most of the global supply of fiat currency is "not real" either as they put it, but man thats a whole nother rabbit hole to try and explain.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:48:14
honestly this is how i see it becoming mainstream, you open up a channel with a bigname exchange like coinbase for example, they send you a debit style card and to use it you use it like a normal card on an EFT terminal. well thats my hope anyway of how it goes mainstream.

im in Australia and they want me to sign up as a business user to use GDAX :( is there any other way?
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:46:58
Cheers mate
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:12:57
Let's make it happen in 2020
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:40:13
i think its enough, hell im just setting up regular deposits every week of that amount currently and watching it grow and grow each week lol

The girl or the dog? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:55:36
Yes, especially around Xmas. And from people who are older and would likely disown you or flat out want to fight you if you asked them about their networth. They then have the gall to get upset when i say 'sorry I'm not comfortable telling you that' 
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:05:32
Wake me up when it's 20k. Damn I didn't get much sleep wtf
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:53:08
he cashed out about half at the 10k mark and i convinced him to HODL the rest after our catch up chat lol. apparently he purchased about 50 coins (give or take dont want to be too accurate on here for obvious reason) after he left the job i met him at, he was a bit worried for a while and then decided to forget about them until the past week when it got crazy. was pretty crazy since i was thinking about this guy as he was about the only person i'd talked to about bitcoin way back then that seemed to take any interest in it and not think i was just a crazy person, then he calls me up lol
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:50:14
My bank (big name Australian bank) starting refusing my purchases from coinbase due to some bullshit about it being high risk for fraud. I'm like so why now and not the other 300-400 times I've purchased using this same method. Got hold of someone in management and had them put a note on my account to allow those transactions from now on unless it's something extremely out of the ordinary like from a different country IP wise. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:01:10
i just smirk. i had a guy i used to work with call me up out of the blue to thank me for telling him about it a few years back. i'd made about $10k off it when it hit $1k per coin and he was wondering where the hell i got that good off an "investment" he ended up purchasing a heap of coins way back then and rang me today to tell me how its changed his life now lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:27:57
Here here. After making me cash out most of my 10 bitcoins when it just peaked over 1k last year I now no longer have a wife and much more financial freedom to buy more bitcoin lol. Slowly but surely getting back up there. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:43:39
Yeah he was happy to cash out en2to pay off his mortgage and was contemplating just cashing out completely. Told him what's the point of buying a nice car and a boat and a nice holiday or something when you could set yourself up for life in a few years. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:22:56
More like BUY BUY5BUY BUY BUY F5 F5 REFRESH Goddambit coinbase is dead again F5 F5 F5 refresh oh shit it's now worth 20k fml
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:51:27
Sir can you post what links you used? Or pm if possible? I have so many people asking me about bitcoin and as much as i understand myself I am not the greatest at explaining it all in person. I'd love to be able to do something like this but other then sending people to Andreas YouTube channel im not that sure what info is relevant for people to understand bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:36:57
Shit this is a good idea. People coming out of the woodworks after i posted about bitcoin a ton back in 2013-14 on Facebook saying it was gonna be huge and getting shot down lol. Oh wait, now you want to listen? Might as well atleast get a dinner out of it
@_date: 2018-06-14 09:35:49
People keep telling me how stupid i am and im like all i want to do is buy more right now but i dont have more money lol
@_date: 2018-06-14 23:03:50
Damn i already sold a kidney prob need to keep the other one. 
@_date: 2019-06-30 12:53:33
Yeah I've been using my coinjar card this way in Australia for years now. Not sure how legal it is tax wise but fucked if I'm withdrawing huge sums of money for the ato to get hold of it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:56:51
Yep very well said. I don't think people should be going without essentials just to buy in that's for sure. But I wouldn't be doing my friends and family right if I didn't tell them I think its worth buying in so they have a piece of the pie when it takes off. Spend that cigarette money on bitcoin lol
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:54:31
I've sold almost everything I own lol. Contemplating selling my car and just buying a cheap run around. Would get me about $30k. House is pretty empty and I've found i can actually live off very little. I just wish I owned my house so I could sell it. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:57:31
I'm of the mind of not 'getting rich quickly' more 'be in the 1% with the new global currency in 5-10 years time' or go back to living a boring meaningless existence of 9-5. At the point of my life I don't care if it drops to 0, but if it goes to some crazy number I'll be in the stratosphere with it. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 01:50:28
My goal is sell half if it hits $100k and move to semi retirement, and go part time not bad for being 35 but I don't see myself retiring fully I'd get too bored and blow too much money lol.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:48:03
Same, I have now purchased bitcoin at $50, $100, $200 $1000, $2500, $4500, and now Ive been buying all the past few weeks as its going up and up lol. Im forever gonna hodl now after my wife made me sell the majority of my 10 coins I had at 1k. If I had a house to sell I'd be selling it right now to buy lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:44:40
yes in all honestly i can say i would. if i could get 300-500k liquid cash for an asset i'd go back to renting and put it all in bitcoin right now.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:23:11
my only concern is i've been with mtgox, BTC-E and now coinbase. i have been bitten twice now with exchanges and don't want them to go the way of the others. i've invested in a hardware wallet this time around because i have far more invested then i did with the other 2 exchanges but still its worrying "not your keys?, not your bitcoin"
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:52:50
I've been pretty vocal about bitcoin for a few years to my close friends and on Facebook. They always come out of the woodworks whenever they hear it's taking a dive lol. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:28:01
People keep coming up to me cause I sold some at 19k asking me am I glad that I got out? What, out? I kept buying at every dip lol. Was so crazy seeing it at 6k but was a great time to buy. Let's ride it back up to 20k again and do groundhog day forever idk
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:21:28
i still can't believe this actually happened and really wasn't that long ago. can you imagine this happening again in our time? wonder how many people just hid or burried it.
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:00:48
also in the same boat, at the time i didn't think the amount i had in there was worth claiming and waiting for(had about 1 and a bit BTC) and just didn't bother and moved on chalking it up to live and learn to not leave coins on exchanges. i really hope you go the route of CR.
