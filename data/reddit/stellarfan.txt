Donald Trump is such a liar. He promised to audit the fed, cut spending, reduce the debt, bring back manufacturing etc. and none of this has happened. Now he bashes bitcoin and will probably threaten to bring it down, not gonna happen!
@_date: 2019-07-17 18:45:42
I like certain things about trump, but I disagree with him on certain issues.
Republicans and democrats have lost their essence.

Rofl. Do you think halving isn't already in the price? It's already priced in dude....
Do you think the exact day halving happens, everybody is going to go nuts and buy the shit out of bitcoin? It's already known dude..

Las time Kim said to buy bitcoin it was at 500$...just saying.
And he probably bought bitcoin when it was lower, so even this big drop he's still in a good position.

Did Bitcoin dieded tho?
@_date: 2018-08-14 09:22:02
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:55:19
Then we need to buy 5000BTC instead of only 50BTC.
We need to print more tether to keep pumping the price man!!
@_date: 2018-08-19 14:20:14
You think a government is going to choose a currency they can't control? Wake the fck up dude. They might accept bitcoin but it won't be a national currency.

Only people selling because of an already known delay regarding the etf, must be ratkids with their parents money. 
@_date: 2018-08-15 09:04:07
@_date: 2018-08-12 11:18:04
Remember that time when bitcoin was at 20k and people were begging for a drop down to 10k, so that they could  buy it "cheap".
Well it's now at 6.3k and people won't buy it because it's going down lol.
@_date: 2018-08-18 19:23:16
Maybe it has nothing to do with halving....
Pure coincidence.

A bull market is born on pessimism my friend.
And I don't mean 1 day of bad news or 1 month, I mean months/years of not seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. Everyday it passes is a day closer to the old times.

@_date: 2018-06-10 19:12:31
No...I still hold mine, I'm just saying that a bull market is born in maximum pessimism and the sooner we get to that stage the better.
We need a massive cleanup like the one in 2014 to start building momentum again.
@_date: 2018-06-13 09:43:30
It's funny because right now the mood is shit and in 1 year everybody is going to be happy again and everybody will forget what's happening right now, the same way they forgot what happened in november/december

I've been doing it in stocks for 5 years now...works on any market. It doesn't work 100% of the time but in my opinion volume is the best indicator there is.
It works very well in big time frames (weekly, monthly chart).
Although I invest long term and don't trade, sometimes I get good opportunities where I do some trading.
@_date: 2018-02-24 21:49:58
You can tell by the chat, that crypto is still unknown... a lot of people "wtf is crypto", "wtf", "wtf is that".
And people watching the stream are young people...can't imagine how unknown must be to old people haha.

@_date: 2018-02-25 14:14:13
Yup that's true, it works very well in a bull market as you said and right now if the market doesn't react there's probably more weakness ahead.
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:53:08

@_date: 2018-07-12 16:26:25
Well I was talking about the weekly/monhly chart. You can see how volume is drying up in a downward move after an explosive move to the upside.
Everytime you see a dip after a big move up and volume dries up,while the price goes sideways and reamins narrow, that's very bullish.
And I'm talking weekly/monthly chart, I don't care about daily/hourly short term noise.
@_date: 2018-07-13 07:26:26
It's funny, because when it goes up, it's because people are realizing the power of bitcoin and when it goes down it's because it's manipulated.

The bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-07-20 18:23:29
An ETF of bitcoin is the most stupid thing ever.
You buy it on Friday, it plunges 30% over the weekend and it gaps 30% down on Monday.
ETF isn't going to bring institutional money, big money will buy the coin and store it safely,if they ever buy it.
@_date: 2018-07-13 13:47:52
There's manipulation in the 1/10 second chart, even in the 1 minute chart because of the spoofers, but to think that this thing has been manipulated for 7-8 months, or even a year.....
@_date: 2018-07-24 11:46:46
Bcash sucks dude.
@_date: 2018-07-20 18:57:51
The whole point of an ETF is to give exposure to a bunch of things to non-institutional people, that would otherwise be to costly.
If someone buys the sp500 etf he's owning 500 companies at a very cheap cost, and doesn't have to buy every share of the 500 companies.
But with bitcoin? wtf? I mean just go and buy it directly on an exchange. And btw let's say that bitcoin hits 50k and you only have 5k to buy bitcoin. If you plan to buy an etf it would literally be imposible, you would need 50k to buy an etf, you cant split one etf into multiple smallpieces of etfs.
I think it's a stupid idea and bitcoin success doesn't rely on this etf thing,
