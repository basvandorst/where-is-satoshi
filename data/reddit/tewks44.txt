I suppose it is, but why is everyone up in arms about what seems to be a totally reasonable reporting requirement?

Fair enough.  I admittedly know very little about bitcoin so it looks like I may have misread the issue here.

I’m surprised how controversial this misreading of these new regulations are in this subreddit.  Does everyone here use bitcoin to evade taxes?  Why else would people here be so upset about being unable to lie about owning bitcoin?

No not all business owners use offshore accounts to evade taxes.  Regardless I don’t see how that’s a relevant counter point.
And the only reason I can think that you’d want to lie about owning bitcoin is evading taxes.  You’re suppose to report all other holdings to the government so I don’t see why bitcoin should be any different.

So is a buy wall where you have multiple parties offering to buy to a single seller and the seller chooses which offer to take and vice versa?

Great resource.  Quick question, how does the system determine a buy vs a sale?  Sorry if this is a  newbie question, but whenever one entity sells another entity buys and vice versus, so how do we take a buy/sell transaction and decide whether we’re calling it a “buy” or a “sale”?

Why does bitcoin attract so many anti-taxation people?  Are you using bitcoin to try and disguise profits and dodge taxes?

I’m assuming he’s just saying that our entire economic system isn’t a scam because stock prices are down.

Ok, fair enough.  Was just curious because I didn’t understand the connection but your explanation makes sense.

Okay, cool.  It’s funny I actually indirectly work with markets (in accounting not finance) and have never learned this.  Thanks!
