The low block size and the resulting debate and slow transaction confirmation and high fees are slowly killing botcoin. And it has been going on for way too long now. Bitcoin could have been so much more valued if we didn't choke the blocksize like this.

Exactly, the point about torrents was never to make things free, it was to revolt against the ridicilous prices for games and movies.      
The game and movie industry first reacted to it by raising prices even higher, but that caused the persons who bought games to also download it because they didn't want to pay extra because other people downloaded, so then they invented DRM and DLC and permanent online and micropayments and stuff like that.

If the taxes are reasonable, most people will pay them anyway, because they know the country can't function without them.

I don't see why I would need a mobile phone, I already have an answering machine, if people need me, they can just call my home phone, and if I am not at home, I will call them back.

Same for computers, Internet, television, washing machines, etc. everything that is new will meet a lot of resistance because they didn't need it before, why woukd they need it now? But once they start to catch on, they will want it, and 10 years later they forgot they ever lived without it. And if it breaks down, they immediatly buy a new one.

If you want effienctly you'll have to centralize, a decentralized project like Bitcoin can never have the most effienct code because it's hard to get consensus to change the code and hard fork to install code that will not be compatible with other versions.     
Having a decentralized system means all versions must work with each other, even if different versions allow different options. This will make the code very complex and ineffiecient, but it will at least provide democracy. True democracy, not fake government democracy.

no, but we have a long way to go before it is force to stop doing that.       
The only reason it would stop is because we run out of people to adopt it (and invest in it). We're not even remotely close to that point.         
And it isnt a coincidence that the moment you run out of people to adopt the currency you also run out of space for your currency to grow in value. Hence the correlation. Also a lot of charts will show you that we are undervalued by about one order of magnitude. A rise to $3000+ is imminent.

the average person doesn't even have a positive balance sheet, the take a loan (mortgage) to even afford the place they live in, and most of their wage is burned just paying of that debt. Among other debts such as for example car, credit cards and student loans. If the average person could afford such a thing, it would be by a loan, and we wouldnt actually own it, but we would borrow it from someone richer than us, who will charge us interest over it (and probably over any 'profit' we might make, which is also heavily taxed (most of that tax money also fills the coffers of the very same rich who actually own your house and your machines and everything you borrow).

you're wrong, let me explain.
Let's say i send 0.5 bitcoin to biling instead of to billing The ANS (Address name server) can not be resolved, because there is no address assigned to biling The ANS can do several things now:
1) It could simply reject the transaction, sending nothing and giving an error like "address can not be resolved, please make sure you provided the right name"
2) it could give you a warning like above and look up the address to see if it can find a simular address, if one or more simular matching address are found, it could give a list of addresses and gie you the option to either cancel the transaction or pick one of the suggested addresses.
3) It could forward the transaction to one of it's own address and store the balance to be used later. (this is not a very good option in my opinion)
The only problem would be if someone made a bunch of fake addresses that are very close to popular real addresses, like for example bet instead of bet there will likely be plenty of unfortunate people who make a typo and the bitcoins will go to a 'name squatter'

The problem i have with bits though is that the word bit itself is too confusing. And if we want to choose a nickname, we should use a nickname that is not confusing. Just like 'satoshi' is not confusing, because 'satoshi' sounds nothing like bitcoin and it's not used for anything else in everyday life. Unlike bit.

The value of bitcoin is in the utility (easy, fast and cheap money transfer around the world, mostly).
bitcoin, unlike gold can not be a store of wealth without having the utility.
Also, in order to STORE wealth, there has to be wealth in the first place. If noone would mine metals at all, it doesn't matter how many bitcoins you have, you will never be able to buy metal simply because there isn't any!

because regular currencies don't have that many decimals. But the system of milli, micro, kilo and mega is used on everything else. It's an official metric prefix.
Also, cents come from the prefix centi-, which is another official metric prefix for 1/100. Although less used in other applications because usually they go in steps of 1000. So they do in fact use the metric system for currency.
Also, again, i do not mind nicknames like pennies, pence, satoshi, etc. As long as they are unambiguous. 'bits' are too confusing because they are much too similar to bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-04-19 20:44:34
because it's a BITcoin and 'bit' is being used as an abbreviation of bitcoin already. It's completely ridiculous to use 'bits of bitcoin' because of the mass confusion it will bring.

yes, that's the point. Bit sounds too much like an abbreviation of bitcoin (and it's in fact often used as such) therefore bit is a stupid nickname for anything other than bitcoin.
Use any nickname you want, except 'bit' or 'coin' and we'll do fine. (ok things like dollars or other existing currencies would obviously not work very well as a nickname either)
Also, a bit is like a really weird number like a 1/12.5th or so and it was only used in even amounts, so 2 bits, 4 bits, so it's basically a half quarter but it was only ever used as a quarter. It's a completely stupid concept, maybe you should call 8 000 000 satoshi (if i'm not mistaken that's 1/12.5 bitcoin) a bit but only use them when you have an even number of bits. Then you're all historically accurate and shit.

An old Arab lived close to New York City for more than 40 years.  He would have loved to plant potatoes in his garden, but he is alone, old and weak.
His son is in college in Paris, so the old man sends him an e-mail.
He explains the problem: "Beloved son, I am very sad, because I can't plant potatoes in my garden. I am sure, if only you were here, you would help and dig up the garden for me. I love you, Your Father." 
The following day, the old man receives a response e-mail from his son: "Beloved Father, please don't touch the garden. It's there that I have hidden 'the THING'. I love you, too, Ahmed"
At 4pm the US Army, The Marines, the FBI, the CIA and the Rangers visit the house of the old man, take the whole garden apart, search every inch, but can't find anything. Disappointed they leave the house. 
A day later, the old man receives another e-mail from his son. "Beloved Father, I hope the garden is dug up by now and you can plant your potatoes. That's all I could do for you from here. I love you, Ahmed."

Very valid point indeed, I hate how people claim that a deflationary currency would never be spent. It's untrue. People will still buy what they want and need, they'd just not buy as much unneccesary stuff. But that's actually good for the economy in the long run.
Taking loans to buy stuff you don't really need may be good for the economy in the short term, but after a year or two the downsides will be much larger then the advantages it brought initially.

They should provide and enforce laws for the benefit of all, for example, arresting murderers and robbers.

Unless you run an industry with a revenue of several millions of dollars a day and manage to get all your revenue from bitcoin overnight, the volume will be more than sufficient.  
You could use coupons or just offer discount when paid in bitcoin to pass on profit to customers.  
Since bitcoin doesn't require you to invest in hardware or expensive contracts with third parties you won't need a ton of sales to profit from accepting bitcoin either.  
You might want to consider using [coinkite]( for their ease of use.

By the way, bitcoin is pretty flexible, QR codes are not necessary for bitcoin to work, just as the internet itself is technically not needed for bitcoin to function either (any network will do)

I think a lot of people are afraid to spend bitcoin because they'll likely rise in value, whereas the dollar (or any other fiat) definitely will decrease in value.
An easy way to circumvent this is for every $1 worth of bitcoin you spend, you immediately buy back $1 worth of bitcoin. This way you buy with bitcoin, and yet your bitcoin amount remains stable. 
This will massively boost the bitcoin economy as well.

Basically the difference is that with dollars, the governement and the 1% are above the law and can do whatever the fuck they want, and they can inflate away all your money until you're left with essentially nothing.
While the 1% of bitcoin owners is only rich now, but once they have spent their money they will have to work just like everyone else.

The point is neither if these pools is nearly as attractive as ghash.io
Ghash.io is the biggest, and therefore has least variance.
Ghash.io has 0% fee, therefore you get the most out of your mining rig
Ghash.io has merged mining on 3 Altcoins, which means even more money.
Ghash.io also paid out the transaction fees to the miners, which yet means even more value.
Ghash.io has the option of sending a percentage of the mining income to a different address (stakeholders) which is handy.
Now name me one pool that comes even close to this.
Why do you think ghash keeps increasing in size? Because the competition is not actually all that much competition if ghash.io beats them in each and every way.
That's why I'm telling you, if you want ghash.io to decrease in size, make something comparable to ghash, and otherwise shut up about it.

Just because something is a conspiracy does not make it a myth. A conspiracy is just a group of people planning to rip a larger group of unknowing people off. Conspiracies happen all the time. 
In fact, it's more stupid to believe there are never any conspiracies and to believe the governments are 100% immune to corruption than it is to believe that they do conspire.
The facts that governments have power and abuse power are all over the place:
-FBI and CIA hiding things up even if it's not directly related to the safety of the nation, and even if the cases are very old (too old to even matter on the successful operation of a mission)
-said companies torturing innocent people

Two hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses. He doesn't seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed. The other guy whips out his phone and calls the emergency services.
He gasps, "My friend is dead! What can I do?"

There is a silence, then a gun shot is heard. Back on the phone, the guy says "OK, now what?"

well, it seems "bits" caught on even though I and several others have strongly voiced our opinion against the use of 'bits'. 
Standard SI units are not complex, but nicknames are still better, just 'bit' is a ridiculous nickname and I refuse to use it.
Would be better to call them 'mikes' or 'cros' (derived from micro), (like dollars and euro's have 'cents', derived from 'centi'. Alternatively we could call them 'units' or something (because the µ is often written as a u)
We could also use Ƀ as the currency symbol and ƀ for micros, just like they use ¢ for cents

indeed, if we're going all derpy american about it let's do it correctly:
1 grain of bitcoins = 1/37th bitcoin
1 bit = 1/48 grains
1 quart = 1/4 bitcoin
1 pound (US) = 1/314 bitcoin
1 pound (UK) = 1/330 bitcoin
1 tablespoon = 1/12 grains
1 teaspoon = 1/5 tablespoon
1 pinch = 27 satoshi
1 stone = 12.5 bitcoin

'bits' are confusing because it's so similar to bitcoin. µXBT follows the international agreements and is not too hard to use. If you absolutely feel the need to get a nickname for it, then at least use something that does NOT include the word 'bit' to avoid confusion with an actual bitcoin.
For example Finneys, Hallies, Dorians, Pennies, whatever... as long as it's not bits.

Why have an ETF for bitcoin, if it's just to trade small quantities it's not necessary. I mean stocks can't be split, so it makes sense to have an ETF for stocks. But bitcoin can be bought for much less than a cent. Even if a single bitcoin would be worth a million dollars you'd still be able to buy a cent worth of bitcoin.

If there are 4 testers, the order of testers should be unknown to the testers and vary per batch. This way the testers can't tamper with it themselves. Otherwise the last tester in line, knowing they won't get tested, can easily tamper with it. But if the tester doesn't know if they're last in line or not, they can't take the risk, because it will be suspicious if a tester behind them in chain will discover some percentage of products has been tampered with.

Even if the miners are horrible wasteful energy wise you'd outcompete Chinese miners as long as you can get your original investment back (miners, which could be secondhand or old models and of course solar panels). Since you don't really need to worry about energy costs and difficulty you can keep mining indefinitely, although if the difficulty becomes really high it might take forever to find a block and you'd not get enough even in pools to get any dust at all.

Do people not pay for the train if the train isn't full?      
A service can charge for their service, even if there isn't a backlog. Miners can ask for a fee, even if blocks are not full.     
Sure if blocks are not full some miners will offer cheaper fees, but that's fine, that's free market dynamics. But it won't hurt Bitcoin at all.       
Let's say one big miner offers fees lower than the norm, and they have a hashrate if 20%. Then users could say, well I'm going to pay a low fee so my block is likely to be included in the next 5 blocks or so. But users could also say, well, I really want my transaction to be in the next block so I'm going to match the higher fee.         
You see, a miner doesn't need to lower their fees to match the other miners, because there is demand for their service.

Old nodes that do not want to upgrade can not opt out unless they write a new client themselves specifically to opt-out of the softfork.    
This means that the only way to bypass a softfork, is by hardforking off to avoid the soft fork.     
A softfork is forcing the users to go along with them, and that's why it's bad to do unless it's an undisputed change.    
Softforks are just as likely to split the network, if not more likely, then hardforks.    
Especially if the hardforks are planned and announced in advance, and coordinated.

Exactly, markets are mainly psychology after all, so a 'fud line' can have an impact for just existing. That's why I think all this stalling is bad. "We'll eventually increase the block size when we need to", while it might already be too late in the eyes of some people.       
I know people might complain about miners not getting their rewards, but honestly the best rewards for Miners is a stronger coin in the first place. Even if they get less fees per transaction, having more transactions means they'll probably even get more total fees, and the fees will be worth more in fiat.

You can't drive miners of the network by accepting larger blocks because you can't force the miners to mine larger blocks.    
Just because you have a 16 lane superhighway doesn't mean you **need** to have 16 cars drive next to each other.    
And miners would never mine blocks that are too big for a majority of the nodes, because they risk getting their blocks orphaned. So actively pushing out nodes and other miners would decrease their profit, so they won't do it.

People won't pay higher fees if the blocks are congested. If the fees become too high, say $10 or so, people will use other coins or even traditional methods.        
Instead, allowing bigger blocks will allow more transactions per block to collect fees on.     
It better to have 100000 people pay $1 in fees each then to have 1000 people pay $10 in fees each.        
It's unrealistic to expect people to pay more then $10 in fees.

It's kind of like how a tall person ducks at a low bar that s quite low, but not quite low enough to hit his head, but the tall person ducks in anticipation.

More transactions = more fees.     
Higher fees only wokr up until the point the fees become so high no one wants to pay them anymore and they just pick a different solution, which not only makes them not collect any fees, it also destroys the value of all the bitcoin they saved up and all the bitcoin they get from the block reward.     
Because it has been proven already that the more users bitcoin has, the higher the price is.

if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)

It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.
When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade.

More low fees &gt; Few high fees.   
There's an upper limit to what people are willing to pay in fees before they just use other payment methods (paypal, altcoins, western union, credit card).    
If transactions exceed that treshold, say $5 or so, then fees will no longer rise, and bitcoin itself will become worthless as no one uses it.    
On the other hand, accepting more transactions won't cost the miner a whole lot, so they can accept many more transactions than they're currently doing, and even if they ask a very small fee per transaction, the sheer number of transactions will more then make up for it.   
On top of that, bitcoin will have more utility and therefore the price will be higher, so even more profit.     
I've have done calculations on this in the past, and it makes sense for the miners to accept as many transactions as they can afford to handle, because the cost of adding an extra transaction is marginal and if the fee is at least reasonable, it's more profitable than trying to crack up the fees.       
It's no surprise most of the miners support BU, it's not only the best for the long term, it's also best for medium and short term.

Having more nodes is good for the network, but it's still a non-issue, drive space is cheap, and every 5 years or so the amount of disk space grows by about a factor of 10 anyway, so 100GB is almost nothing even today and in the next 5 years it's even less than nothing.

exactly, because it didnt.       
You seriously can't seriously think bitcoin is unstable because it 'crashed' from $1244 to $200 over the course of 3 years after having risen from $12 to $1244 over the course of 11 months just before.       
That's just not a crash, it's a correction, and even a correction so slow that even if you took a few years to react, you'd still be better of then you were if you invested at any point before the peak.          
It it very hard to lose money in bitcoin if all you do is buy and hold.        
Pick a timeframe, and than pick a random date, and write down the price at that time, and then the price it is after that timeframe. Repeat this process 100 times with new random dates. You'll see that in the vast majority of cases (probably over 90%) bitcoin would have made a profit.       
Buy and hold just makes a lot of sense.

We won't live to see it, but by that time Bitcoin should have so many transactions per second that the miners make more than enough money on fees.      
Today, about 5% of the miners revenue is from fees. After the halving and the block size increase this would probably become somewhere between 7.5 and 12.5%.      
In 2020 it might reach 25% already.      
Eventually the block reward itself will be near meaningless.

The thing that infuriated me most is that people told me to stop lobbying against "bit" because "bit" would never catch on.      
And then a few months later it suddenly was everywhere.         
I don't mind any name, as long as it's not something stupid like "bit", "bit" is just not unambiguous enough and doesn't make sense.       
Personally I use cents, mills, crows, because that is the most clear for me, (cent from centi, just like regular cents, mills from milli, as in 1/1000, which is also a financial term just like cent, but less common for obvious reasons, and crow for micro which is the same amount as the "bit").       
For writing I usually just use the symbols for milli and micro. So mXBT or μXBT respectively, you can use u instead of μ because most people won't see the difference and it doesn't conflict with any other symbols.          
The ones who lobbied for "bits" we're really manipulative too, they made a poll, but the poll was biased. Because the poll basically asked: "do you want the unit of '100 satoshi' to have a name" and the only yes answer was "yes it should be called bit". But in reality, those are two different questions, and most people just voted yes because they wanted '100 satoshi' to have a name for convience and voted yes even though they didn't like the name bit in particular, there were polls on what the name should be, but they were largely ignored, and even sabotages by "bit" fanboys.

It's actually a very profitable idea for them. In the off-hours many electricity producers need to shut down part of their facilities because otherwise they would produce too much electricity and if there are not enough users the network would get way too much power. Switching th facilities on and off costs a lot of resources and problems. And sudden increase or decrease in demand is problematic as well.        
Sadly we don't have very efficient ways of storing elecricity, batteries have horrible conversion ratios, so that's not really an option. It's even worse with natural energy, because wind, solar and water energy are hard to control. So elecricity companies could just have a large mining server inside their facilties, that instantly power on to use excess power, and throttle down whenever the area they serve require more energy. This way the facilities can always run at maximum efficiency.

I'm not sure if you are serious or not. But people use the term bit to mean 100 satoshi. While in my opinion the only use for bit would be as an abbreviation to bitcoin in the context of millibit/microbit because microbitcoin/millibitcoin is just too long of a word.     
Then, millibit/microbit could be made even shorter to mill and crow respectively.     
There, words that make perfect sense to everyone, and are short and easy to remember.

The only reason it has more support is because a wallet started using it and because it was the only name for it it catches on.

bit is a lot of things and how much a bit is worth is confusing.    
Bit could be assumed to be short for bitcoin in which case it would mean 1 bitcoin. Especally in the context of terms such as millibit (no one is going to say milli-bitcoin because it's too long).       
Meanwhile some retards have been calling 100 satoshi a bit. So a bit could be assumed to be worth this much.    
A bit is also an old monetary term that is 1/8th of a coin, so based on this it could also mean 0.125 bitcoin.     
A bit in computers is the smallest unit of storage, so one could also assume a bit is the smallest piece of bitcoin you can have.     
With so many conflicting potential meanings, the term bit should be avoided altogether.
@_date: 2017-01-23 10:57:58

I think fiatleaks works by measuring exchanges, and Chinese exchanges are the most active because they have no fees.

The thing is for someone who doesn't know about bitcoin they have no clue how much a bit is, but they do know how much a millibitcoin is. And they would easily understand that a mill is just short for millibitcoin. Same with crow for microbitcoin.      
It just makes more intuitive sense to call them mills and crows.       
It can't be confused, it's easy to understand, and even outsiders will easily understand what you are talking about.   
Mills and crows, easy. No fucking bits.      
It's even mroe confusing when you talk of millibits and bits, and a bit is actually 1/1000th of a millibit instead of the other way around. Now that's confusing, and no amount of context will fix that. Because millibit is divined by the SI system as 1/1000th of a bit, but if you agree to call 100 satoshi a bit, then a bit is actually 1/1000th of a millibit, which is the **exact opposite** of what you would expect.

@_date: 2016-06-07 16:12:28
the tx fees are high now because the block size is arbitrarily limited to 1MB, once more transactions fit into the block, the transactions can be cheaper. Since most of the cost is making/finding the block itself, verifying the transactions doesnt cost a whole lot extra. The only reason it's so expensive now is because there don't fit a lot of transactions in a block at the moment.         
Also, miners pay their electricity largely in USD/CNY or other fiat currency, so if bitcoin price rises, the fee (in terms of bitcoin) lowers as well.     
@_date: 2016-12-25 10:57:03

what does eth have to do with anything
@_date: 2016-12-23 23:09:09
Yes and no.     
Leaving a copy in your will is risky (you don't know who might have access/read it before it should be read).       
Best to leave part of the solution in your will, and part of the solution somewhere safe (where someone can reach it).     
Since both are only part of the solution, neither piece matter if someone knows it, as long as they don't know both parts.      
As soon as you pass away, that someone will get the will, and will have both pieces of the puzzle and therefore access to your coins.      
      
You can do this by what is known as a M-of-N multisig wallet.     
In this case, 2-of-3 would be good. Meaning you need 2 out of 3 keys to spend the coins.      
Key 1: your own key (no one should ever know this except you).    
Key 2: your 'will' key. This one is included in your will.      
Key 3: The friend key. This one is kept by a friend. (it's important he never can access the key in your will except after you passed away)                
      
You should have a copy somewhere safe of either Key 2 or key 3 (or both) as well as key 1. So that you have access to 2 keys so you can spend whenever you want.      
A friend/family member you want to leave the money to should you pass away should have key 3. Which is useless by itself.     
Should you pass away, that friend/family member would get Key 2 as well (which is also worthless on its own). Since he now has access to 2 keys he can access all the bitcoin on the wallet.      
Best way to do it IMO.
@_date: 2016-12-23 19:07:08
Don't trust anyone with your coins.   
It's only your bitcoin if you are the exclusive owner of the private key. He who holds the key holds the coins.    
There's no need for anyone else but yourself to know your private key (public address is fine to share, private key is not).    
It's fine to have small amounts of bitcoin in a 'hot wallet' (on your phone, on a website) but your main storage should best be kept in a hardware wallet or offline cold wallet.

It's bound to happen eventually.    
Bitcoin can't succeed with a market cap of only 15 billion.

The bitcoin core team (one of the development teams, and the one who is in control of this subreddit and the biggest bitcoin forum, therefore they have the most power does not want to make more capacity on the blockchain.    
Ideally, to keep bitcoin decentralized, you'd have a hard fork so users can vote on how to change bitcoin. This is the democratic option.       
Bitcoin core doesn't want democracy, and they claim hard forks are dangerous. The only ting dangerous about hardforks is that it undermines their position of power.

Ask yourself, why are there only free apps, or $0.99 apps on the app store, but never $0.20 apps? And why do none of the free to play games allow payments of under $0.99?

Rushing it? A blocksize increase is way overdue, and they didn't exactly stall when they were *setting* the arbitrary 1MB limit. Which was most likely an anti-spam measure anyway, and set in place years ago, when the average blocksize was like 50 times smaller.    
But due to exponential growth, that blocksize is now actually limiting bitcoins growth, and the limit is hurting more than it helps now.   
There's no reason to keep this arbitrary limit at all, it doesn't benefit anyone.
@_date: 2016-09-22 20:41:56
It's not about fees, full is full, no matter how much you pay.    
A 1MB block filled with 1MB of transactions literally can't accept any more transactions even if you pay a million in fees.      
I have been holding for years, probably longer than most of you kids, this isn't about 'get rich quick' this is about long-term survival of bitcoin.      
The average blocksize is actually declining now, as well as bitcoins market share compared to altcoins. This seems to indicate bitcoin users are actively moving to altcoins.    
Bitcoin will never be a good store of value if it's not also a currency. Because **all of bitcoins value comes from being an efficient currency**, hence if it loses that status, or loses the network effect to an altcoin because of poor development, bitcoin will become worthless and losses not only its status as a currency, but also as a store of value.        
Bitcoin was never meant to just buy and hold only. Bitcoin was meant as a payment system as well. Core is trying to hijack bitcoin and killing it in the process.      
I want bitcoin to succeed as digital gold, but in order to do so, it has to be currency as well. And many other things.     
If you want to keep holding, keep holding (I am doing just the same). But allow those who want to spend to spend,  because your value comes from their spending. You should encourage spending, not discourage it. Even if you just want to hold.
@_date: 2016-09-22 20:44:35
I'm complaining about Core manipulating the shit out of bitcoin and deceiving a large portion of the gullible users.     
     


Please elaborate. I am inclined to believe the opposite.     
        
You can look it up yourself.      
      


      
at best it would lead to more centralization, at worst, it would turn people away to altcoins.      
     


      
These aren't mutually exclusive. In fact, low fees (more accurately: a fee market that isn't limited by artificial limits such as blocksize set by the protocol) are likely to increase security. Miners and spenders can agree on fees, so that miners can be profitable (and therefore there's more incentive for miners to continue or start mining) and uers will be able to transact with affordable fees that are enough to support the network. Fees too low will be ignored, and if miners are asking too much, the users won't spent. There's no reason for a hard limit in the protocol (except a limit to prevent the nodes from 'blowing up') but we can easily have 4MB blocks while still being no problem for 98% of the nodes. It won't cause any security risks and it won't bring more centralization.
@_date: 2016-09-22 12:32:09


     
This has nothing to do with blocksize. Bigger blocks aren't harder to mine (at least not until the blocks become too big for the average internet network or hard disk or memory, whichever bottlenecks first).    
   
Mining centralization right now is because of two main reasons.    
1) Electricity costs. (Both in actual $/kWh as in Hashes/kW)    
2) Availability and affordability of hardware.       
     
Neither of those have anything to do with blocksize. I mined before, when ASICs were still somewhat affordable, but I stopped when ASICs became hard to even buy without getting scammed (many of the miners I ordered never arrived, so I lost a lot of money on this and I'm not alone on this).     
Furthermore, electricity is expensive here anyway, so mining wouldn't be profitable unless I find a reliable ASIC manufacturer and a place to get cheap electricity (such as near a hydro dam).          
         


        
No it doesn't. Smaller blocks mean fees will rises through the roof, and the amount of transactions, and therefore the total amount of fees will be limited. Therefore, only large transactions can be made on-chain, and those transactions won't cover the cost of mining. So once the block rewards become smaller, mining won't be sustainable, except for the top most efficient miners, so the other miners will be forced to quit. This will lead to more centralization, not only with miners, but also with payment processors, because there won't be enough on-chain room for the individual because this would be cost-prohibitive.       
           


      
No chance in hell that would happen, and read above comment.       
       


        
False, the smaller the blocksize, the more centralized we will become. As for reason explained above.

Inflation encourages borrowing money and spending money you can't afford to spend, because by the time you need to pay back your debt, the money has become worth less. Most of the economy is based on debt right now, and this is also why we have constant crisis, because people default on their debts, and these defaults cascade down on each other. Collapsing the economy like a house of cards.    
It also discourages saving, because the money you have worked hard for a year ago is worth less than it was back then. Both problems are even reinforced by the low interest rates.     
This is encouraging short-sighted behavior in humans, and might even affect other areas of life. More in [this post](

yes, people wait for newer models, but eventually they do buy a model.     
The general consensus on most of these topics is also to just buy, because if you're going to wait, you might as well wait forever. There's always a newer model being produced.      
Buy an upgrade whenever you think you need one, and buy the best hardware you can afford at that time (whatever you consider to be best might differ from person to person).          
It's even more important with food. People won't wait to buy food because they expect the price of food to drop by 0.2% the next day. Or even 20%. People won't skip a day of food unless they literally can't afford food.

Just stating that I'm incorrect doesn't make me incorrect, nor does it make you correct.    
Even the worst rated countries in the world, Burkina Faso and Niger have average Internet speeds of 0.86Mb/s download and 0.3Mb/s upload.  Even they would only need a few seconds to download and propagate the block.    
As I said, the real bottleneck is CPU power.    
You can easily proof this by downloading a Bitcoin client on a computer that has no blockchain validated on it. Even if you have 500Mb/s Internet like me it will take days to validate the blockchain, even though it only takes seconds/minutes to download the entire blockchain, the problem is it needs to validate it. That's why the computer is also much slower to respond while doing that. And the CPU I have isn't the problem either because I fun an i7.     
Validating transactions takes a lot of CPU power, and only marginal bandwidth.   
Bandwidth is the least important issue because internet speeds are more than sufficient.     
And besides, the 1MB limit was never meant to be actually reached. It was just there as an anti-spam measure.

Nothing wrong with rice and beans if people want rice and beans.     
I don't think it will have an effect that significant though. It's just purely your speculation that it will happen, you don't have proof it will happen.      
Hyperinflation would cause that to happen, hyper-deflation will most likely cause it to happen as well.      
Slight deflation will probably not have a significant effect on spending, except for slightly more rational spending behavior and less spending on extreme luxury. (Not buying the latest Iphone every time, for example, and not taking loans).      
It's actually proven that people value immediate reward more than possible returns in the future.         
 (somewhat related)   
So even though people will probably realize that saving money will benefit them in the long term, most people would still prefer a nice restaurant meal today than to have $20 profit next year because they were having rice with beans today.     
There's no need to put extra incentives on top of the psychological rewards. People will spend, people will save, economy will do fine. No need to blow the economy up by unnecessary loans and creating debtslaves.

people are more comfortable spending money when they feel richer.     
Now we could discus what makes people feel richer?   
Inflation because people see huge numbers on their bank account, even though these huge number are worth less than they used to be? (for example a bottle of coke was only $0.05 a few decades ago, and $10,000 used to be a fortune back then, now most western people make that in a month or 2).       
Or is it deflation because they can buy more actual goods for the same amount of money? Making them feel more comfortable about their purchasing power?       
It's hard to know for sure what makes people feel comfortable spending money.      
Furthermore, should we really encourage an economy of endless spending, instead of an economy of just buying what you actually need? The endless spending economy is only a result of the current economic model after all. The biggest industry on earth is advertisements to make the masses buy stuff they don't need and don't actually want, so that the mass producers can get rid of their inventory because they produced way too much (because producing in bulk is cheaper). And because investors expect exponential returns of investment on everything every year, despite the fact that we have limited resources (we only have 1 planet worth of resources so far) and a limited amount of humans to buy stuff.         
With a deflationary currency we might need to encourage smarter purchasing behavior. Of course you can still buy fun stuff like tvs, computers and such. But the whole wallstreet infinitely scaling exponential profit margins and unsustainable bussness models based on overporducton and overconsumption won't work unless you have an inherently inflationary financial system ("bubble money" because to sustain the illusion of a working system and 'profit' you need to not only inflate the money supply, but inflate the rate of inflation. Yo dawg, i heard you like inflation, so I inflated your inflation rate so you can whipe your ass with dollars because it's actually cheaper than toilet paper.), and that's a good thing in my opinion that an economic model like that is not sustainable with a deflationary currency. (That's also the reason why governments and banks keep cheating the people away from a gold standard, that's not a new thing at all, the romans did it before the fall of the roman empire by mixing gold with bronze and other elements, early banks did it by fractional reserve banking)

More money is pointless if the money you saved is worth less.    
In fact, inflation is stealing from the people unless they borrowed money, in which case the lender is ripped off. Which is why the lender has to charge interest.    
This whole structure in turn causes a debt-based system, which will eventually collapse when too many people at once default on their loans.      
Most people would be happy to know their hard-earned cash will actually become worth more over time, so that saving actually makes sense.

They can hack services and websites, but they can't hack your bitcoin wallet (as long as you secure it properly).      
Websites using traditional payment methods can get hacked and the payment data is valuable, which can lead to credit card information and bank account information being stolen. Which can be used to steal from your bank.      
But with bitcoin, it doesn't matter if the website gets hacked because they won't be able to steal your bitcoin wallet anyway. So this makes transactions saver and cheaper, because the website needs to worry much less about security.

Why not?      
Nothing wrong with hardforks. Best fork survives. Assuming the public isn't stupid (which might be a wrong assumption, based on looking around).      
Ethereum is doing fine though. Bitcoin will do fine too after a hardfork.    
Besides, people are actually already working on a hardfork for bitcoin right now, and guess why they are forking?    
Because the core devs refuse to upgrade the blocksize, despite the fact that people want an increase.     
There would be no need for a hardfork f the core devs just did what the public wanted, instead of pushing their own agenda. But they forget that bitcoin is open source, so when they don't do what the public wants, a hardfork is imminent.      
You can't hold the bitcoin protocol hostage, the protocol will be what the public wants it to be, and if the public wants bigger blocks (which is apparently the case since blocks are constantly full right now), then bigger blocks will happen, one way or another.     
I just wish it would be a bit 'cleaner' but apperantly talking didn't work out so well. BIP 102 was a great idea, and many seemed to agree, but it got shoved under the carpet for no apparent reason, and when I bring it up, I get downvoted for it.     
And still no one gives me any reason or any clue what even happened to BIP 102.       
What happened to open discussion without being downvoted into oblivion, what happened to voting on solutions to problems everyone sees?    
Why do people suddenly stick their heads in the sand and blindly follow some devs without any reasoning to back up their support?    
Why do people centralize themselves and clam they are being more decentralized by following a 'leader'?

No, we are changing things by nkt raising the limit. Never before in history has Bitcoin actually reached the bkocksize limit. It was never meant to be reached.    
The best way to keep things the same is by raising the limit so that it won't be reached for a while again.

hopefully before the next bullrun will never happen again because bitcoin has been overtaken by an altcoin because of the lingering blocksize debate.         
I never expected the debate to still not be solved after the halving event.
@_date: 2016-09-22 12:40:40
This is called math. It's solid.     
You don't need to be afraid of 20MB blocksizes, because everyone can run it.        
It won't reduce the amount of miners, and it may end up increasing the amount.      
If you really want more miners:    
1) Provide free/cheap electricity to a large group of people, preferably spread around the world.      
2) Make energy-efficient mining hardware readily available at a reasonable price.         
       
Miners are stopping their mining because they can't compete, not because of blocksize, but because of costs of electricity.       
Every miner has a specific amount of energy (kW) per amount of hashes. (H/kW ratio). Every miner also needs to pay for their electricity ($/kWh). Every miner also gets pad for their work ($/H, based on difficulty and pool, or luck if they aren't in a pool).           
If you make a formula out of that, you can calculate whether or not you are mining at a profit or a loss.    
Basically, if you have old hardware that is less efficient (needs more kW for the same amount of H) or if your electricity is expensive (more $ for each kWh) you won't be able to compete.       
Blocksize is not part of the equation at all.       
However, a bigger blocksize can fit more transactions, and thus more fees, so more miners would be profitable. So if anything, bigger blocks make it LESS centralized.     
(up until the point where the blocks become too big for the memory, bandwidth or hard disk, but blocks have to become **WAY BIGGER** for that to happen, even if we would increase the blocksize to 1GB that would be fine for most miners).

@_date: 2016-09-24 19:07:09
it's 5 cents now, but you have to consider what a 1MB blocksize means for the future.       
The more transactions are made, the bigger the competition is to be included in the block. The fees won't stay 5 cents.
@_date: 2016-09-22 21:08:22


Do you really want to wait and see for it to happen?     
We can already see right now that bitcoin has lost market share to altcoins. We can also see that the average blocksize has gone down since june. It's easy to connect the dots. And the longer we wait, the more people will move to alts.      


     
Not all miners mine full blocks, even if they can. Miners aren't forced to use all transactions. Likewise, because there are so many unconfirmed transactions and many people know the blocks are full, spenders don't want to bother with it, and just move to an altcoin without even attempting to make bitcoin transactions.      
I don't want free/extremely cheap fees, but I want a natural fee market without artificial limits set by the protocol. I also want bitcoin to be widely adopted and used as a currency. And it looks like the current stance of Core is turning away users, which is what I want to prevent and salvage as much as possible.        
I wouldn't be this angry at Core if I wasn't worried about bitcoins long-term future. But the way I see it, Core is destroying bitcoins future, and we urgently need to stop them from destroying it and forcing people to altcoins before it's too late. They probably already done a lot of unrecoverable damage, but every day we allow them to continue it's getting worse.    
We should definitely not wait for every block to be filled by 100% before taking action (or even discussing), because even if we assume it will happen at some point (which might not even be the case) it would be too late at that time.      
It's not like you can reach any kind of consensus in a month or any reasonable timeframe, so actions have to be planned long in advance. In fact, the blocksize debate was going on for 1,5 years (and still is going on, although heavily censored/ignored or people became bored of it or whatever). It's funny how most people seemed to agree most of that time that the blocksize needed to increase, but they did not agree on how to do it, but now we have actually taken a step backwards and people don't even agree on that anymore.      


Math. the fees to sustain the miners would be too high for anyone to pay except if you bundle many transactions together, but that would bring centralization and defeats the purpose of bitcoin. The less transactions you allow, the higher the fees need to be to support miners. Extra transactions don't costs extra work for the miners, so any non-trivial fee is pure income for the miner.      


     
Where is LN? Was promised half a year ago, it's still nowhere to be seen. Core promising things, not delivering. And yet, people believe in them while they are destroying bitcoin. Good job, I'm proud of my fellow bitcoiners.      
     


      
that's your version of the story, just repeat what Core sais. Let's run bitcoin together.        
    


      
For now, how long will they warm up to bitcoin if they notice Core is destroying it from the inside?

miners aren't the only ones who can vote, that's an illusion.

@_date: 2016-09-22 12:34:06


     
As I explained earlier, the mining centralization has nothing to do with blocksize, and as mining fees will be reduced (by 'halvings'), this will only get worse if we keep small blocksizes, because there won't be enough transactions with fees to cover the cost, so only the most efficient miners will be able to compete, therefore, it would become even more centralized.

Pretty common for someone who doesn't have anything better to say to call whoever that opposes their opinion stupid, without actually giving a reason to back up their claims.      
If your arguments for keeping the 1MB blocksize are so solid, than why haven't you quoted any of these so called solid arguments?    
As much as I dislike the idea of moving to altcoins, if this blocksize issue stays, I will have no choice but to move on to an altcoin and hope I picked the right one.
@_date: 2016-09-22 12:37:11


      
Increasing the blocksize has nothing to do with get-rich-quick     
       


       
Miners don't turn of their mining equipment because they are getting too many transaction fees. Miners are turning of their equipment because the cost of electricity is higher than the amount of bitcoin they receive, because they are being out-competed by miners who either have cheaper electricity or more energy-efficient miners. Or both.      
Have you ever mined before? I have. And I know why I was forced to stop. It had **nothing** to do with blocksize.       
In fact, more transactions would mean more fees, and therefore more profit and therefore more miners would be able to compete before being forced out because of beng cost-prohibited.      
If anything, more transactions (bigger blocks) means more miners.

70-80% is not enough considering it will only deploy next year.     
If even it will be deployed next year, as they said they would deploy this year and they haven't done that either.       
Bitcoin isn't moving forward at all, and the discussion from last year is just being ignored.     
Consensus was reached and that consensus is just being ignored.      
I haven't heard a single reason why we should keep the 1MB blocksize despite the fact that we reach the limit more often than not on each block, and it's limiting growth and adoption, and thus it's hurting bitcoin adoption.    
But yeah keep sticking your head in the sand, eventually the problem will solve itself as people will either hardfork and move to that fork or move to an altcoin and ignore bitcoin altogether.   
Either way, bitcoin core will be able to run on 1MB, no even on 1kB, because no one will use it anymore.     
Have fun holding on to bitcoin while t's $0.01 per bitcoin.      
It has nothing to do with 'get-rich-quick' I have probably been holding bitcoin longer than any of you.     
It's about the future of bitcoin, and the way you are treating bitcoin right now bitcoin will not have a future.    
But yeah, let's ignore consensus because a handful of people told you that "1MB blocks are big enough, and larger blocks will lead to centralization" and mainwhile you follow those people like zombies, mainwhile ignoring that most people actually voted in favor of bigger blocks.       
Who is centralized now?         
Keep waiting for the promise of a centralized solution that will get postponed again and again, and will hand down control of bitcoin even more to centralized parties, in order to be more 'decentralized' because you can mine on your smartphone.       
Seriously 1MB/10 minutes is nothing, it's only 13kB/s you could run that on a 90s phone.     
If you can't run a 20MB node you have no business being a node. (and to be honest everyone with any kind of internet connection can run that, even in africa.)
@_date: 2016-09-08 19:12:41
Because bitcoin is decentralized, it's hard to create an artificial advantage for the rich, or a 'trickle down economy'.    
This is of course by design, because even though bitcoin can't assure 100% equality for everyone, it will be more equal than a fiat system where only central banks can create money legally. And people who bring actual value will get their worth in bitcoin, while people who don't produce any value will need to spend bitcoin to get what they need. Therefore losing bitcoin in the process.    
So the rich will not get richer unless they bring value. The way money is supposed to work.
@_date: 2016-09-22 08:02:12
No, consensus is not status quo.       
Status quo means keeping everything the same, so maintaining status quo will never get you anywhere.     
Consensus is agreement to do something or to don't do something. Consensus us for BIP102 was reached months ago, but we still maintained status quo despite the fact that many wanted to upgrade to 2MB.       
We don't need 100% of the users, if we have more than 50% it's enough. And we do.       
The latency stays the same no matter the blocksize. Upload of 2MB per minute is also very small, it's still only 260kB/s or so.     
Do we really need time travelers from the 90s to be able to bring their hipster computers to run a full node?    
Even people in Africa can afford 260kB/s

Hint: we need it now, because blocks are full.         
        


if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
    maxblocksize = largerlimit
It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.
When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade.          
        
The 1MB blocksize limit was never meant to be permanent and was never meant to be an actual limit, but rather an anti-spam measure. Note that the average blocksize back then was 20kB. Not anywhere near 1MB.

It has nothing to do with "get rich quick", fact is we have reached the point where 1MB blocks are common, and we have absolutely no headroom for growth, and the block size has been growing until the point were it can't grow anymore.     
It would probably still grow if it could. But it can't, and now all we're doing is forcing new adopters to run to altcoins. Slowly killing bitcoin in the process.    
The only people profiting from this are those invested in altcoins.

Encouraging spending just to spend it bad, and purposeful inflation is just stealing/hidden tax (and tax can be considered a form of stealing as well).      
People will spend on things they need, there's no need to encourage needless spending.       
People will buy a bread when they are hungry, people will buy gas when they need to fill up their car, people will buy a tv when they want to watch tv.      
There's no need to steal from smart people who save money for when they need it, and to incentive dumb people who borrow money to buy things they can't afford. It's stealing from the wise (savers) to give to the dumb (borrowers). It's encouraging irresponsible behavior, which is the reason we are in this financial mess in the first place. Irresponsible borrowing. It's bad, it's irresponsible, and it's supported by inflation.     
Deflation won't discourage people to buy things they need or really want, but it will discourage irresponsible spending/borrowing behavior and it will encourage wise saving behavior and caring about the future.     
This change of mindset might actually also trigger people to think more about the future in general, and make wiser decisions on environment, health, and other things future-related things.    
I am pretty sure there is a relation between the "instant-gratification borrowing culture" we have created and the shortsightedness of people. Most people nowadays don't care about the future and only care about their immediate short-term happiness with complete disregard for the future. If we change to a deflationary currency that supports thinking about your financial future, it might support long-term awareness in other areas as well. Which will benefit society as a whole a great deal.

False, there have always been fees, even when the blocksizes were small.      
Miners have no reason to accept transactions without fees, as it doesn't benefit them.      
      


      
This might be fine in a vacuum, but bitcoin is not in a vacuum, there are other alternatives, and if bitcoin does not supply enough to fit the demand, users will find other solutions. And once they are invested in an altcoin, they are unlikely to ever switch back to bitcoin, why would they?         
Bitcoin is not the best coin, but it can still remain the biggest because of network effect, but **only** if we actually allow bitcoin to remain the biggest. **Smothering bitcoin will only make the only advantage we have over altcoins evaporate.**      


      
If most isn't enough, than the opposite is even less, and even worse.    
There wasn't even a question about "should we upgrade the blocksize or not" because it was so widely accepted that the question did not even need to be asked. And even now, most entities agree the blocksize needs to become larger. Only a few very noisy (and shortsighted) individuals disagree.         


      
Where's SW and LN? You keep saying they're coming, but they are nowhere to be seen. Instead of relying on dreams, why not just increase the blocksize to give bitcoin some breathing space, and then afterwards implement fancy new features. Increasing the blocksize isn't hard, it's just 1 line of code, nothing can go wrong there.        


       
Big mining pools have already stated that they won't accept SW without a blocksize increase. Why not increase? It's impossible to deploy SW/LN without miners, and the miners won't accept it without a blocksize increase. And since you're planning on increasing the blocksize afterwards anyway, why not just do it now?       


      
I live in the real world, not in some kind of dream build on promises that don't come. Instead of relying on 5 teams to get their shit together eventually, just change 1 line in the code that doesn't even take 5 seconds, and give the 5 teams the time to develop their shit and test it and whatever. Upgrade to 4MB should give them a year or 2 more before we start running into problems. Should be plenty to get SW/LN or some other solution ready.

Actually the bottleneck is CPU power, not bandwidth and not storage.   
And CPU power has gone up a lot since the last 10 years.      
1MB/10 minutes is absolutely nothing, even by 90s standards.   
Even for slow internet it takes only a few seconds to download a block of 2, 4 or even 8 MB.    
Even a 20 MB block would take me a fraction of a second to download. I know my internet is fast, but even if someone would have internet several orders of magnitude lower than mine, they'd still be fine with bigger blocks.

Network is not worth anything if the community runs with the value and ignores your version of bitcoin.     
Also, allowing the block size limit to be reached is not conservative. The (longterm)effects of hitting the blocksize limit are not tested, and should not be tested. Especially not on the main chain.

Well first of all, no one would buy 100 bitcoin back in the day, and likewise, no one would buy 100 bitcoin now.      
No matter when people invest, they'd most likely invest a relatively small amount (especially at first). Like $10~$100 or so.     
And while it's true that the same $100 would buy you many more bitcoins 5 years ago than it does now, the risk of bitcoin dropping to $0 was also much bigger back then, so the risk of losing your $100 investment would be much bigger.    
While right now, if you invest $100 in bitcoin, the risk of your $100 becoming worth $100 is really small.     
Sure, the people who invested years ago got rich (if they had the balls to hold during all the ups and downs, which is unlikely). But it could have gone bad as well. The thing is, you don't hear about all the times it went bad, because the bad investments fade into obscurity.

Because fees become prohibitively expensive for the average user, so the only way to spent on-chain is to gather lots of transactions on a centralized payment processor, which will act as a VISA or paypal to process many transactions at once on chain. Problem is, you need to trust them, so centralization.

Demand for blocksize is outpacing capacity every single block.       
And you failed economics too apperantly.      
If I sell apples at the market, I won't make more money by selling my apples for $100 each, but I would make more money if I sold them for $0.50 each, because I would sell my entire inventory.     
Likewise, higher fees means less transactions, so less income. While higher fees means more income.    
We will never be able to replace block reward with fees if we need to have 1MB blocks. Even the current reward of 12.5 Bitcoin divided over 1000 transactions would be 0.0125 Bitcoin transaction fees. That's over $5 in fees.          
Segwit was supposed to launch in July this year, now it's july next year, what excuse will they bring next year? Why put your hope on a 3rdparty solution while Bitcoin itself can scale just fine? Does it physically hurt anyone to increase the blocksize?      
A network split will happen, not because I wa to it to happen, but because a few retards are too dumb to remeber their own stance on the subject the had 6 months ago, and now completely changed sides and are too stubborn to see the problem and how it will ruin Bitcoin if no action is taken.

A fee ecosystem does not need to be 'maintained'. The bitcoin block limit was never reached, and yet there were always fees. Miners will just ignore transactions without fees because they cost effort to process and transmit, so its not worth it even if they fit in the block.    
In fact, miners need bigger blocks so that more transaction can fit so they get more fees. Instead blockstream is trying to steal the transaction fees from the miners by making their own system on top of the protocol.    
What do you think will happen once the block reward becomes too low to support the miners, and the fees now go to the Core devs instead of to the miners?

Most blocks are full (1 or 2 kB of room doesn't count, because it doesn't fit any more transactions in that).      
Out of the last 123 blocks, 71 were full, and a further 20 were over 50% full.      
A large majority of the blocks is full, so larger blocks are needed.    
What is even more worrying is that since June the average blocksize has been going down, which is a very rare occurrence since generally it goes up. This is worrying because it could indicate people are using altcoins instead of bitcoins, and bitcoin is losing market share.   
      
Blocks will never be truly full, because people will move to altcoins before clogging the network. If you wait for 100% of the blocks to be 100% full, you're already to late. We have reached the peak in June, and now we are declining.     
     


      
I can't guarantee that, but I can guarantee that with 1MB blocks you can't support the miners we currently have, let alone support even more miners. The only chance we have to support miners is by allowing more transactions (and therefore more fees)      
      


     
Then you're missing the point of bitcoin. This is not what is promised in the whitepaper.       
      


      
The real reason it's delayed is because mining pools are refusing to use SegWit without an accompanying increase to 2MB. Which was promised to miners, but then that promise was broken.    
Obviously, the Core devs won't tell you thát though.      
       


       
You are forgetting that by not forking, people will just run to altcoins, which makes the situation even worse.

By the time they go live, we need yet another blocksize increase.     
     
And I know about the HF, I support it, as any reasonable person would.      
I'm just amazed that it has come to this, as just a few months ago everyone seemed to agree we need to scale, and now the topic is barely even discussed anymore.      
Why the sudden change of mind, especially considering that Segwit and LN were also discussed back then, and were supposed to go live months ago and didn't go live, and at this time a majority of the blocks are full.      
      
I would prefer not to be forced into a hardfork (or worse yet, and altcoin), but it seems I am being left no choice.      
Just why is it so hard to implement the blocksize increase, since a majority of the mining pools already agrees.
@_date: 2016-09-22 07:49:42
It does increase scalability because it allows more users to use the protocol, which is urgently needed because we are hitting the limit several times per hour.    
There's the indication that we want bigger block sizes, the blocksize would be used if the people had the choice, but the people don't have a choice.     
Votes were made a few months ago, and voted were unanimously in favor of increase, and yet, increase is not given.     
At least 3 different proposals were made, BIP 101, 102 and 103. 102 was favored by most. But now all of them at ignored.      
     
Anti spam was the reason the 1MB limit was put in place 6 years ago when the average blocksize was 20 kB. It no,longer serves that purpose and the only purpose it has now is to limit the amount of transactions per minute.    
I am well aware fees need to replace block subsidy, but limiting the amount of transactions is not the way to do it. More expensive transactions, like you already confirmed yourself, will only prevent people from making transactions. People will withhold their transactions to clump them up to reduce fees, people will use altcoin a with lower fees, etc.     
the best way to make miners earn fees, is by increasing the amount of transactions, so that the fees will be lower. This might sound counterintuitive, but lower fees mean more people will transact, so the total amount of fees is higher.     
Tax a thing and less people will do it, subsidize a thing and more people will do it. We need transaction fees to be as low as possible, so that the amount of transactions will be high. That way, miners will still have income in 2100
@_date: 2016-09-21 19:00:45
isn't it funny that people have complained and been worried about the blockchain size as far back as at least 2013, and that at least as far back as 2015 the general consensus was that "2MB blocks will be needed eventually, the only question is when and how".     
And that recently a majority agreed that the blocksize needed to be increased, but the discussion was about the rate of increase. [And even the mining pools agreed](       
But now, for some reason, there's rarely any talk about blocksize, and if there is, a lot of people seem to believe we are fine at 1MB, even though people never agreed to 1MB before.     
It's like people have completely lost their minds suddenly.

@_date: 2016-09-22 07:23:52
Why do fees need to go higher?      
It's better for everyone to keep fees low, even for the miners. Because lower fees mean more transactions, and more transactions mean more fees.      
Bitcoin can't be digital gold if it isn't also digital money. Because if it's not widely used as money it has no value.

When the 1MB blocksize limit was included the average block size was only like 2% of that.   
Clearly the 1MB limit was not meant to be any limit to actual transactions, but rather to prevent spam attacks.

about 1% of our energy comes from solar, and the technology isn't quite there yet to make that 100%, even if we would invest a huge amount of money into solar panels.   
There are other reasons a 100% solar (or natural energy) won't work.      
One of the problems is maintaining the frequency of the AC network. Which is 50/60Hz depending on if you live in Europe or the USA. If you don't maintain a stable AC frequency, the lights would flicker all the time and that would be annoying and might lead to headaches.     
Another problem is the unpredictable supply of natural energy and the unpredictable demand of users. You can't just turn solar panels on/off and you can't just turn the sun itself on/off. Having too much energy will risk damaging hardware, having too few energy will cause power outages. We don't have batteries capable of handling and storing energy on this scale.      
There are solutions to these problems, but to implement working solutions on a scale this big will require several years at least.     
And even then, we can't just go around wasting metals and other limited resources.

It's not about price, it's about users.    
There's no room for new users, and that's holding back Bitcoin.   
And permanently keeping 1mb blocks won't help with decentralization.     
Also, here's some quote from the white paper for you:    


As such, the verification is reliable as long as honest nodes control the network, but is more vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy to protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to confirm the inconsistency. Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.        
         
If you're so worried about centralization why don't you complain they are t working on point 7 of the white paper to decrease the overall size of the blockchain?     


A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of 1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in memory.        
       
That seems a lot better for Bitcoin in general.

They can see the transaction, but not who the transaction belongs to.       
So, let's say you ask your employer to pay your wage in bitcoin, and you ask him to send it to this address (none of these are real addresses):      
1iJ1lTzg7RzqTTmYARacq       
So the transaction for everyone to see would be      
1ETmlzmgoFe2WjevxDMrQ send 10 bitcoin to 1iJ1lTzg7RzqTTmYARacq     
But except you and your boss, no one else knows who these addresses belong to.     
Now, if you ask your friend to send you to that same address, he will also know that that is your address, and although he can't do anything with that information. He would be able to see how much money you recieve on that particular address, so you just gave up a little bit of your privacy.     
If you give a different address for each transaction it's easier to organize for yourself (you will know which transactions came from which person) and it will give you more privacy. (No one will know how much money you get from other sources, and how much you spent).

before coinbase (or whoever was the first to introduce it) used it in their service, it was a highly controversial topic. In 2011 or something there was a poll where it got shot down by an overwhelming majority. Then late 2013 the topic came up again, and even though there wasn't an overwhelming majority, there was still a majority against the idea of calling it a bit (note, most people did agree there should be a name, just not bit, many alternative names were proposed though).  
At some point someone made a [push poll]( with the question: "should 100 satoshi be called a bit" and you could either vote yes or no. The reason that this poll was biased, is because it completely disregarded the popular opinion that the unit should be named, but not named 'bit'.  
The reason many people are opposed to bit, is because the term bit is highly confusing. Especially because millibit and microbit are popular acronyms for a millibitcoin and a microbitcoin. But since we now also have the unit bit, we can only expect kilobit and megabit to also emerge. Which would leave to much confusion. Also, the unit bit itself was not understood by many in some other polls, where was asked "how much is a bit". The opinions varied from 1 bitcoin to 12.5 bitcoin to 1/8th of a bitcoin to 100 satoshi and many other options. (all of them equally 'valid').   
It seems like all the newcomers have embraced the hype of calling it bit, and stick their head in the sand against the older generation that made bitcoin possible in the first place, and downvote everyone who is opposed to the idea of calling it bit.  
All I want is what is best for bitcoin, and that is giving it a name that is not ambiguous.

no one was arguing naming 100 satoshi, but a LOT of people were opposed to calling them 'bits'.  
  
On the official forums they even told us "don't worry, calling them bit is so unpopular, no on will call them bits." Oh, I just wish they were right on that. But sadly they weren't. Bit is about the worst name you can imagine, and I still think we need a better name.   
  
Like jstolfi said (and I know he is usually regarded as a troll, but I agree with him on this matter). Just because people agree the unit '100 satoshi' should have a name does not mean we agree on the same name. The poll that was held to 'agree' upon a decision was a push poll. Because you was either against the very idea of naming it, or you wanted to name it 'bit'. That's manipulation, and it's wrong. And the name bit is wrong as well.

Maybe not in america, but in Europe it is.  
And I am really sad that even bitcoin is infested by american nonsense units of measurement, We might as well have called it a foot instead.  
I can't help it you live in a country full of people that are too stupid to know how the metric system works, but literally every country other than america does.  
Seriously, micro/milli to technical, that says a lot about your intelligence. But how about we call it a bit, and add to the confusion of people who are easily confused, what a wonderful idea.  
I don't see the problem using micro and milli because we ALREADY use cents as well, but you're probably not even aware of the fact that cent is the same metric scale as milli and micro. And you also probably never heard of the term mill in finance either.  
But that's still no reason to call it bit, especially because 'bit' could just as easily refer to a full bitcoin, or a fraction thereof, or even a large number of bitcoin (12.5). Note that a bit is already a unit of currency in itself (although a very dated one)  
Milli and mirco are used EVERYWHERE in Europe, from food packaging and recipes to rulers as well as measuring electric current in consumer electronics. Even lagg is measured in ms (MILLIseconds).  
That "funny u" (µ) which is actually pronounced mu and is used for micro (milli uses m).  
More importantly  I AM NOT AGAINST NAMING IT, I AM JUST AGAINST THE NAME BIT. You must be seriously stupid to not understand that you can be against the name itself, but not against giving it a name in general.  
Let me illustrate the point. Suppose I had a child and my wife would want to name the son Charles, but I don't like the name Charles so I propose to name him Peter instead. The fact that i refused the name Charles does not mean I refuse to name my child.   
And FYI milli means a thousandth and a micro means a millionth. It's just much easier to say milli instead of a thousandth. (Unless you are american and have no common sense whatsoever, and no form of education whatsoever). I feel sorry for americans, having no proper education and everything, I just hate the fact that they are so fucking ignorant of the world around them. Get the fuck on the metric system already, what century do you guys live in, seriously?

A hardfork might actually the best way to finally resolve this issue. Because apparently we can not resolve this peacefully.         
     


    
Upgrading blocksize is easy, getting fancy new features to work is not.

yup, and since i dont think many people would use the full word centi-bitcoin as it's so long and people are more likely to call it centibit, millibit etc. Which makes the word bit all the more confusing. (I have also heard the terms bitcent and mill).

Yet I'm the one not thinking for myself? Last I checked, you are in the mainstream and you're the one not thinking for yourself.

So core got the miners to sign an agreement and have them abandon mining the competing blocks, just so they could claim "consensus", and then Core did not follow up on their end of the bargain and they succeeded in stalling another half a year without improving bitcoin.

yes, the bankers of bitcoin.    
Bitcoin was designed to not require a central authority, but bitcoin core is the de facto authority of bitcoin right now, and the very fact that we even have a group of dictators running bitcoin is a very bad thing. If this does not change immediately, bitcoin is doomed forever and another crypto will hopefully take its place. And hopefully that crypto that does take the place of bitcoin will stay closer to bitcoins original vision of freedom and no central authority.     
Yes we need developers, but we don't need the developers to hold absolute power over bitcoin, and bitcoin core devs have way too much control and power right now. That's unhealthy.

yes of course the 'low fee' transactions will be the ones left behind, miners aren't stupid.    
That does not prove that there is no problem though.    
And scaling does not destroy the trustless network. We have been on 1MB for years, and it does no longer fit the right balance between hardware and network capabilities compared to needs.    
The blocksize limit should be more dynamic and based on the needs of the users as well as the limits of the nodes. Best would be to let the nodes decide, and not some guys 'at the top' in suits.   
Nodes should decide for themselves what they can and can't handle, just like how we have done in the past.    
It has worked fine until now, so why change it into a hard limit set by devs instead of by a soft limit set by the nodes themselves?      
If the nodes think 4MB is too much let them softcap it, no big deal, they have done so before they can do so now.
@_date: 2016-10-27 08:06:37

Sure, some early investors will benefit, but rightly so, they took the risk, they helped build the system. Unlike the current system though, the elite won't have a way to cheat the system, so In the long run Bitcoin is much fairer. The rich won't get richer in Bitcoin by unfair methods, but they do in the current system. Which is why bitcoin is fairer.        
That woman also claimed that the current system is better because money you put at banks is used by the banks to invest and gets back into the economy, while if you hold Bitcoin in cold storage no one uses it and it hurts the economy. That's simply not true. The problem is that the current economy is backwards. Basically huge companies take loans to produce absolutely insane amounts of products so that the price per unit goes down, then spends millions on advertising so that hopefully people will buy their products. And their products are made so they only last for a while so when they launch a new version a year later people will buy it. This is not sustainable.     
Bitcoin has the chance to drastically chance our lifestyle for the better, by having a more sustainable economy which is also more environmentally friendly, instead of this backwards system.

Math says we can have bigger blocksize than we could in 2009, math did not demand 1MB blocksize limit, Core devs did.       


    
Of course not, but it's a necessity for bitcoin to become useful as a currency that matters on a global scale. You can't revolutionize anything with a billion dollar market cap. And besides, that's no reason to purposely keep bitcoin cheap.

At the time it was implemented, denial of service attacks on the blockchain were common. Or at least attempted attacks.    
In order to make it more difficult for those kinds of attacks, a limit on the blocksize was put in place.     
The average blocksize at that time was only 20kB so there was a lot of headroom.      
Right now, there's absolutely no headroom.

So core even admits they are sabotaging bitcoin by forcing the small users off the network.     


   
For who? Not for bitcoin users, it will dilute the value of bitcoin. Every $ spend on an altcoin is a $ not spend on bitcoin. Thus, lowers the total value of bitcoin.      
     


   
The internet seems to work fine, mobile telephones seem to work fine too, despite billions of people sending text messages. Also, the resources used to upkeep altcoin networks could just as easily be used to strengthen the bitcoin network instead. So your argument is moot.

It's not about the fucking fees, it's about a simple fix taking years of debate and the core devs undermining bitcoin. If you're too blind to see what is happening that's not my fault. But seriously you have been hit by propaganda. Stick your head even deeper down the ass of blockstream devs.

Cutting a queue does not solve the queue, it will just put other people at the end of the queue.    
It might look solved to you, but it is not solved for others, the total amount of people waiting for their transaction to confirm will stay the same (and with more adoption, would even increase)     
The only way the problem will solve itself is by having less adoption.    
So either the developers solve the blocksize, or the users will solve it by using altcoins.

Too little too late. I would have been fine with this in april, but not anymore.     
It's funny how the hong kong agreement made this exact agreement at the start of the year, but core never followed up on their promise.    
That's why a compromise with Core is not possible. Even if they promise to agree, they will break their promise.    
It is obvious by now that the goal of Core is not to scale//improve bitcoin, but only to stall bitcoin indefinitely so that they can offer their own solution in the form of blockstream that will only benefit them, and not the user.
@_date: 2016-10-12 05:43:19
as with all technology.    
Users demand more features, which will be more taxing on the technology. But technology advances.    
Look at hard drives, GPU, CPU, memory etc compared to 10 years ago.  
Same with cars, look at fuel usage and safety and comfort features for 10 year old cars for example.     
Technology always moves forward.    
You can't just say "oh well bitcoin will always need more transaction, so if we scale up now the cycle will never end because eventually we will reach the limit again".  No, that's the point. Technology is always a balance between user demand and technological limits.    
You always move the limits to meet demands, and demand will adjust to the limits, but only if the limits are technological in nature, and not artificial like they are now.    
There is no reason to not upgrade the blocksize, and doing so will only strengthen bitcoins competition at the expense of bitcoin.      
It will only enrich altcoin investors but it will come at the price of bitcoin investors.    
I want BITCOIN to succeed, not altcoins.

[Money placed into a banking institution for safekeeping. Bank deposits are made to deposit accounts at a banking institution, such as savings accounts, checking accounts and money market accounts. The account holder has the right to withdraw any deposited funds, as set forth in the terms and conditions of the account. **The "deposit" itself is a liability owed by the bank to the depositor (the person or entity that made the deposit), and refers to this liability rather than to the actual funds that are deposited.**](
When someone opens a bank account and makes a deposit of $500 cash, the account holder surrenders legal title to the $500 cash. This cash becomes an asset of the bank; the account becomes a liability.

Also, you talk about intelligence, but you don't even know the difference between your and you're.    
And you start your argument with science is not a democracy, then back up your opinion by how much support you have, and at the same time you say I don't think for myself, even though you are the one who is following the masses.    
Make up your mind man, your arguments are all over the place.      
I guess your strategy to 'winning' arguments is to be at every side at once, so whichever side is easier to defend you'll defend, and whenever it gets hard to defend that side you'll just defend the other side because you were at both sides (or neither) all along.       
Grow some spine and get some actual solid arguments and pick a side. Seriously, it's pointless debating if you don't even know which side you are on.

We need to get rid of our outdated system and come up with a new one. Our system just doesn't work in this modern time anymore.

So banks gambling with our money is a good thing?     
We'd be better of without our money being stolen by the banks.     
The only reason money needs to be reinvested in the current economy is a direct result of how our economy works right now.      
Basically a company borrows a lot of money from a bank (money the bank doesn't have in the first place), to mass produce a product, than aggressively market the product to consumers, to pay back their debt, rinse and repeat.       
With changing to Bitcoin, we'd need to change more than just our payment method, we need to create a more logical and self sustainable economy, our whole current economy is based on smokes and mirrors and benefits mostly the rich.     
We are using up too many natural resources and polluting the earth just to keep the system going, but with Bitcoin we are more likely to buy onky what we really need because a deflationary currency would discourage extravagant expenses because if you spent too much today you will be worse off tomorrow, assuming your money would be worth more tomorrow.     
As for companies that need money to get started, they could try crowdfunding, and I'm sure in time someone wil figure out an honest loan system that works for all parties, if we really need it. The current loan system is broken anyway, I mean, a bank can just loan money they don't have and then charge interest over it. That's just cheating.

Of course, it's rare for banks to not make true on the claims, but in extreme cases they can and will freeze your account.

bitcoin is usually long bear markets (not 2 years though, that was a really long one) followed by short but explosive bull runs.      
Bitcoin goes up really fast in a short period of time just to slowly slide back down and repeat the whole process, that's going to continue for a few years until we get to a high enough market cap where we will stabilize.

Blocksize can be increase now too, no need to wait.     
Blocks are not 80% full. Most blocks are 100% full, it's just a few blocks that are nearly empty that make the average block size lock not full, but there's no way the average block size will ever be above 80% because some miners just always mine empty blocks.     


Bullshit, the blockchain is the blockchain. the chain with the most work wins, and you should not care about the other chains that don't follow the main chain. It's backwards compatible by design, because the blockchain always has the rest of the chain included in itself.       
    


    
It is NOT cautious to limit the blocksize and 'see what happens' it's sabotage. It's the opposite of caution. Bitcoin CORE is doing damage to bitcoin and it might be unrecoverable. Unlimited is trying to mitigate the damage that is ALREADY been done by Core and try to revert what damage they have done.      
And let me tell you, if bitcoin unlimited fails, bitcoin s doomed. All those people that came back from altcoins to support unlimited, they will go back to their altcoins, and everyone who supports unlimited will go to altcoins as well. And the core supported will grow smaller in size and bitcoin will wither and die. And Altcoins will replace bitcoin until eventually the name bitcoin is largely forgotten. Bitcoin will be just another meaningless altcoin without a future.     
   


   
Except for the fact that technological growth is exponential as well. We can and should keep up. Or at least try to keep up the best we can.    
What core is doing is equivalent to going into a corner and cry about how we can't scale. That's not a solution. Just GET THE FUCK OUT and leave it to the people who ACTUALLY have a solution to scale bitcoin instead of crying we can't scale.     
 CAN AND WILL SCALE      
and if WE don't scale, altcoins WILL scale and people will just move to altcoins which is LETHAL to bitcoins. It does not help bitcoin it's not good for bitcoin at all. It will KILL bitcoin.      
    


   
Except for the fact that not everyone runs a node and even if everyone would run a node, not every node has to be connected to ALL other nodes. So your argument is invalid. By default a node is connected to only 8 other nodes. It does not matter if there are 8, 800, 8000 or 8 million nodes, it will only connect to 8 nodes.
@_date: 2016-10-12 18:32:13
A hard fork will let both communities go their own way and work on their own project.   
It's ironically we have at least 2 separate subreddits that hate each other, and 2 separate development teams that hate each other, but you still want both of these groups to stay together on one chain, instead of doing the logical thing and have 1 chain for each group and let the chains figure it out.   
And if at some later point in time one of the groups sees the error of their ways and wants to rejoin the main group, they can agree on terms to rejoin the main chain again if possible. Or they just stay seperate forever and the weaker chain would either permanently stay a weaker chain or would eventually wither and die off.     
It's much better to do that than to have constant fighting that will stall development and will give bitcoin a very bad image to newcomers.        
Also, if most people agree we need to scale (and i'm fairly sure most users DO want to scale) than a hard fork would mean that most people would get behind the one that scales, and the old one would quickly be completely ignored, so it would not cause a split **at all**.      
We are already split in so many ways right now, and ironically a simple hard fork that most people agree on would prevent FURTHER splitting of the community. A hard fork can either occur peacefully or aggressively, I prefer it to be done peacefully. Most people want it peacefully (that's why we proposed BIP 109, as a compromise between core and XT, but Core did not want a compromise, so if they don't want a peaceful fork, they will get an aggresive fork). But a fork they will get, one way or another. I'm sad they did not choose the wise road of a peaceful fork. But their demise is on their own heads. We offered them peace, they did not want it.      
It s very important to note that the guys supporting XT/Classic/Unlimited (note how all these 3 proposals were mostly backed by the same people) have offered many solutions and have tried to come up with ways that would be agreeable to Core. We have shown a lot of effort to get Core to work together to find a solution, but Core wants none of it. And what's worse, they don't offer any counter-proposal either. Core is the one that is sticking a large stick in the wheel, not XT/Classic/Unlimited. We wanted peace, but Core does not want peace.        
So, aggressive hardfork it is then, sadly. But it has to be done. Bitcoin needs to remain open and decentralized, and core has shown us they just want absolute power and control, and we can't have that. If you don't see the similarities between Core and every dictator ever than you really need to open your eyes.     
And why is it so incredibly important to get SW/LN first and increased blocksize later instead of the other way around? I wouldn't have minded if SW/LN were rolled out when they were supposed to be rolled out (BEFORE the halving) and even then there were plans to upgrade to 2MB by April or June or something, and there were even agreements on that with mining pools.          
But what Core is doing now is just stalling.       


   
I don't know if you have been around here for long, but this discussion has been going on since at least 2014, it's not impatience that's the issue, it's ignorance and a large "the problem will fix itself" attitude. The problem WONT fix itself and we need to constantly look ahead if we don't want to be out-competed by altcoins. You have to look ahead, sometimes years ahead, and not spend years and years debating things and never reaching any solution whatsoever.      


    
If they can't chose a *bitcoin* blockchain they can get behind, they will find and *altcoin* blockchain they can get behind. Just because there aren't 2 bitcoin chains does not mean crypto users won't switch chains. But except now they will leave bitcoin altogther which is much worse. *Bitcoin* needs to offer choice, unless you want people to move to altcoins to make their choice, and make bitcoin lose a lot of value in the process. Even moving it into obscurity.

It's not always an attack, sometimes by chance two blocks are found quickly after one another and the new block just didn't bother or did not have time to verify more transactions so the block is (mostly) empty.   
Most of the not so full blocks happen when blocks are found shortly after another, not because there are not any transactions but because of other reasons.     
    


   
They can try, but no one would support them.


The limit was set years ago, when the average blocksize was 20kB. And the network was often attacked by spam.     


   
In what century?     
  


   
not true, changing a number is only to give us some breathing room, but other solutions on top of that exists such as Xthin and others.    


    
Yes but having more nodes or more transactions does not exponentially increase the load on the nodes like you claim.

Who googles JFK really?        
The thing is doubling is relative, if the baseline amount of searches is for example 100 persons a day, the it's easy for it to skyrocket once millions or billions of people search for it. (Something that would happen if suddenly there is a big news item for something that happened a long time ago.        
With something that has a constant flow of probably hunderds of thousands of searches a day like Bitcoin, a few hundred thousand extra will not be an 'explosive' growth.      
So it could be that the baseline is just really high. Which it pretty much is.      
Since Google trends is always relative, it's hard to know how much people actually search for Bitcoin, but this peak is pretty high and it has only once been higher. And the baseline is always at least 20% since the last peak.      
Of course, Bitcoin still gets dwarved by game of thrones and such. As Bitcoin gets only about 6% of the searches game of throne does. So there's still a long way to go.

You mean just like theymos own the two mayor communication channels?   
This Reddit and bitcointalk. Yeah that's a great way to keep Bitcoin decentralized.    
You guys are so dumb if you can't see the writing on the wall.   
Bitcoin core is only called core because they are rotten to the core. And they just want to push their ideas called block the stream.     
And by the way. I don't get paid. I just own a reasonable sum of Bitcoin and I don't want it to become worthless by poor development teams who have a hidden agenda.    
If you really want to support core, go buy some altcoins, because core really does not want Bitcoin to succeed.      


     
How many more years will you believe their lies of "segwit coming soon (no, really, this time we mean it)." And lightning network. And increased block sizes. They promised all of this, but they never kept any of their promise.    
And why not increase the blocksize now while we wait for other solutions? It's going to need increasing sooner or later anyway so why the fuck wait?     
There is no reason to wait. Everyone agrees Bitcoin needs to scale at some point, so      
 do it!     
Seriously fork this coin already, a blocksize increase is way overdue. And mark my words, the second we mine our first block that is bigger than 1mb the Bitcoin price will skyrocket. And yes, that's a good thing for Bitcoin in case you have to ask.        
    


     
Yes, the rotten to the core team.        
     


    
Except it was never full before core team became the dominant team. And adoption halted since the amount of transactions has reached the hard limit, which also puts a hard limit on the value of Bitcoin. Since transaction and value are directly correlated.      
And now that core is losing market share to unlimited, altcoins are tanking and Bitcoin is rising again. That is no coincidence, people moved to altcoins to vote with their wallets and show their distrust in Bitcoin core. And they disliked the idea of core so much they'd even go as far as to prefer a different coin over Bitcoin, but now that an alternative is gaining tractor they return to Bitcoin, but only to support unlimited.    
If you want to keep your Bitcoin, you better make sure you out your coins on the right fork, because otherwise you'll be trading worthless coins.     
Just a friendly warning to you because core will get destroyed, no in fact, they're doing a good job of destroying themselves. Look, I and many others, including ver, would have supported core with everything we had if core was actually good for Bitcoin, but they are not, they are destructive.

Math bounds the usage of bitcoin just as much as graphic cards limit game development.     
Sure, you can't have games with infinitely complex models, but the limit is constantly moving, and as long as the limit moves faster than what is demanded from it, everything works fine. But when the limit is reached, development stops.    
Same with bitcoin. We have reached the limit, and adoption is slowing.      
However, we have only reached an artificial limit that is being kept by bitcoin core, and not a limit that is necessary. We can and should push the technology further, and by not pushing it further we are limiting the possibilities.

If the fees will be that high, mining will automatically become really profitable (lots of transactions with lots of fees means lots of profit for miners). Therefore, more miners would enter the market, therefore mining would become more centralized again, driving the fees down again until equilibrium is reached.

i heard something about 20 times leverage, maybe that might fix the equation. So if i'm not mistakes then he went short at 472.39 with 20x leverage and 20475 contracts and got margin called at 477.        
(477.28-472.39)\*20\*20475 = about 2 million       
If that calculation is right though, then he's a total moron to short that big in a market this volatile with upwards momentum.

The problem is that pretty much everyone does agree that Bitcoin needs to scale, but everyone has other ideas on how it should scale, which results in a problem where Bitcoin does not scale, because we can't agree on how it should scale, which will hurt everyone.

Except in fact fiat is not "worth" anything either until you buy goods with it. This is a critical flaw in logic many people have. They see fiat as something of value, while it really isn't.
What really holds value is the goods you have bought, like clothes, food, a home, etc.
Even non-physical goods, like the time you can spend with your family once you don't have to spend much of your life working a terrible 9-5 office job to enrich the CEO of the company while you get paid much less than you should get is value. 
Once people realize fiat currency is just worthless paper, we're already much closer to using real currency. In fact i'd even prefer not using any currency at all (not even bitcoin), but humanity is not ready for a change that big, so bitcoin is the next best thing.

Ok Matt, about the hacking questions, there's not really 1 way to answer it, as it really depends on what you consider hacking.
If by hacking you mean altering the code to print infinite bitcoins, it's impossible unless a large majority of bitcoin users (user, not only miners, but actual users) agree with the change, which will obviously never happen.
If by hacking you mean stealing coins by knowing someone's public address, it's very unlikely. Even the smartest math geniuses in the world have tried to break the SHA256 encryption and failed (and bitcoin uses DOUBLE SHA256 encryption). If for some reason SHA256 would prove to be too weak, since it is open source, a new encryption can be used, as long as a large majority of users agrees with the new encryption (which they should).
Most banks and pretty much everything also use SHA256 encryption so if SHA256 fails, bitcoin would not be the only target, and most likely at this point it wouldn't be the biggest target either.
So, hacking bitcoin is pretty much impossible and unlikely to ever happen. The worst thing that is likely to happen is getting your private key stolen because you have it stored on a computer, unencrypted.

I have to say here, I own both an ipad and an iPhone, but it got both for free (secondhand) and Altough the OS is very stable, I still don't like the arbitrary restrictions like no flash and a lot of apps that are banned from the AppStore and such. Of course you can work your way around most of these restrictions but still.

the thing is, usually as a customer you don't notice the fees, because the store pays the fees. (the price of the item already includes fees). 
However to the store owner the fees are often in the range of 5~10%  so bitcoin is much cheaper (in the range of 0~1% ).
the store owner can than even lower prices for bitcoin users because of the lower fees.

Didn't know that, but knowing apple mostly from iDevices and the amount of arbitrary limitations they put on their software (and hardware as well, for example the intentional lack of SD slots so that they can sell high memory devices for much more cash) I guess they'd find a way to modify their computers so that it would be nearly impossable to instal anything but apple OS on it.

When you look at bitcointalk, most people argue about the price, or news that directly influences the price positively or negatively.
I agree that a lot of people do not look beyond that, and that's very sad. I guess it's just how the world is nowadays. Even I am often temped to think of my bitcoins as an investment, and I do occasionally day-trade. But for me, bitcoin is more than just an investment, it's a paradigm shift away from corrupt fiat currencies.
Bitcoin opens so many possibilities it's hard to name them all, but most people hardly even seem to know that.
It's a pity there's so little attention for the real ideas behind bitcoin.

The whole idea behind bitcoin is that it's decentralized, why would you make a bitcoin clone that's centralized. We are currently migrating away from the centralized systems, as history has shown us that those in control of centralized systems will always abuse the system in their favor. And thereby hurting everyone else.

Is it really a good idea to put a 1 hour long 'crash course' on the home page? I assume your target is new to bitcoin and doesn't want to invest 1 hour of their time just to learn the basics.

Everyone is pretending to know chinese
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:42:22
seriously? you still need goods that you can buy with bitcoin, because bitcoin would not be worth much if there was nothing on this planet to buy with your bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-17 06:37:57
Pretendent to be an idiot is still being an idiot. Sarcasm over the internet just doesnt work well.
@_date: 2013-12-14 03:15:25
"Overnight" is probably a bit exaggerated. But definitely a good idea to let them know about bitcoin. Imagine if oil would be sold in bitcoin.

NFC and QR codes are nice, but people are used to debit/credit cards, using both systems simultaneously may make it easier for the customer to understand and adapt to bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:09:31
as long as you have a system that relays the information, it will work, this can even be by radio signals or medium distance communication. Internet is therefore optional (but currently the most efficient known method).

40 bars is not a lot, but it's a start.

Thanks for supporting the bitcoin economy.
Enjoy your free advertising.

So if the entire world would put their net worth in bitcoin, a bitcoin would be worth 26,2 million?
@_date: 2013-12-13 16:01:37
The coinkite POS also accepts regular (QR) bitcoin payments. The power of the bitcoin protocol is that it's so versatile.
But yes the card itself is only useful at coinkite machines.

the dutch translation is even more fun, because it translates "bit coin" as something that loosely translates to "few coins" or "part of a coin"
in fact it took me a while to realize the word bitcoin was translated into dutch in a weird way.
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:28:49
That's exactly why bitcoin is so awesome, bankers should not be allowed to tell YOU what YOU can or cannot do with YOUR money.
It's YOUR money not THEIRS.
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:19:34
a clean solution would be better indeed, there's no need to waste resources, even if it's as little as 1 satoshi.
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:57:36
Lol why would you need a round disk to rol beneath the object, it only makes it heavier to carry. You silly fool. Just carry your goods like a real man and stop wasting lumber on useless 'inventions'

Not anymore, since 2012 or so domain names can also be in non-Latin text.
@_date: 2013-12-15 12:56:18
I disagree, if you air 30 seconds instead of say 2 minutes, you can run the ad 4 times more often for roughly the same price (or is this not how ads work?) 
I think if you show the same short ad more often, it has a bigger rate of succes than a long ad running less often. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 11:28:13
I actually already did, refer to this Facebook post, open letter and forum post

the internet was too complex for the average person 20 years ago, but that didn't stop it from evolving.

I'm sure some people can, but i surely do not have anywhere near enough bitcoins to do that.
but i would if i could. (I love planes)

Such profit
much growth 
So bitcoin
Buy more

all the more reason not to sell at $500

in the top right you have Pinterest, Twitter and Facebook icons, so why not place payment option icons on the top left, it's completely empty space.
you should place icons at the top of the page before even thinking about hiding things in the bottom, noone scrolls to the bottom of the page first.

Kraken is very underrated at the moment because it's jsut out of beta, but it's by far the best exchange.
If only for the fact that they're much less restrictive in validating new customers and payment/withdrawal options.

Space flight is hardly a revolution, at least until we are able to colonize other planets or mine metals outside of our own planet it's pretty useless.
The Internet and electricity are cool though. Still I think bitcoin can compete with these
@_date: 2013-12-16 16:48:43
still much higher than bitcoin fees.

When I read piece of Japanese ass I tought it was a translation error, boy was I wrong.

Anyway nice article.

I didn't even look into ripple because I don't need it, why would I even bother reading up on something that's so obviously unneccesary?

Misleading title, I tought it would make 7-eleven and Walmart accept bitcoin as a payment. Now that would be news.
@_date: 2013-12-15 23:43:10
But no, what i really want in a central bank is that they control the money supply so that i get poor by inflation.
Just like cyprus and argentina, the central bank there really did a great job at controlling the currency. The inflation is just fantastic, i love it.
Why does bitcoin not have a real central bank, owned by corrupt bankers? A central bank controlled by math is so stupid. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 16:10:24
Wow, very good points you make. I have been a fan of bitcoin for a long time, but even for me, reading this article really made me realize how much utility bitcoin actually has.

If you don't hold the keys, you don't hold the coins.
So no.
you'd be stupid to move your fiat from the bank into bitcoins in a bitcoin bank.
The whole idea behind bitcoin is that you can be your OWN bank.

That's why bitcoin are better than money and banks. Never keep all your savings in dollars or any other local currency.
@_date: 2013-12-14 02:14:22
The collapse of a currency is usually very fast (even moreso in a time where information spreads in milliseconds). All fiat currency will eventually fall. The dollar is already crumbling, because China and Russia and other big economies are already starting to trade in their own currencies in international trades. 
In my opinion losing all your money is actually more likely to happen when you have all your money in euros or dollars, especially on a bank. (Cyprus anyone?)
