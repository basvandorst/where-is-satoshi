Correct!  I've no issues with the concept, either ... and find the default libertarian/bitcoin/end-the-Fed circlejerks about it amusing - given that there's no reason it wouldn't happen in a free market economy.


Exactly right again.  That's where I think the bitcoiners/libertarian types go off-the-rails and invert the causation.  Regulations about fractional reserve banking doesn't *cause* fractional reserve banking.  FRB would come about on its own merely for competiton reasons.  Regulations come in, to lay down rules and say say "*woah woah woah -- you've taken too much risk with your customer's deposits, and therefore need to always keep X% in reserve.*"

Wow.  Such delusion.


All debates about monetary policy, 100% reserve banking, etc. aside - this is purely idiotic.  The author is mixing up different economic concepts ("wealth effect" and "deflation") interchangeably - which would have catastrophic results.  
If you think about it on a "global currency" kind of scale (as the author seems to think is inevitable) ... deflation is actually the *worst* possible outcome.  For example, if you think about buying a new car today, but decide you can hold off for 6 more months because your currency will be worth more 6 months from now - you delay your purchase.  Now, multiply that action by billions of people on the planet ... and consumption shifts from the present to the future as consumers wait for prices to fall.  The drop in aggregate demand depress the economy, companies go out of business, there are more price decreases, etc. etc. into a downward spiral leading to an economic depression or collapse.
This isn't Chicago School or Austrian School or anything else - this is basic common sense.  If you earn $1 today, but it will be worth $2 tomorrow ... you'll probably hold off on spending it today.

Correct.  And of that $35bn, you have to pay to transport piles of cash around to lots of those branch locations mentioned above ... make sure it's secure ... staff those locations, etc. etc. etc.
Western Union's profit margin [was 15% last year]( (on $5.5bn in revenue).  So if the $35bn in fees carries about 85% in expenses ... that means the *total profit for the entire worldwide remittances market* is about $5 billion dollars.

They do not have the authorization to "charge whatever they want".  They can't throw a keg party for the staff one night and say "*Haha, let's bill it to meowcafe's credit card!!!*".  You signed a contract giving them the right to charge certain fees at certain intervals.

I perhaps should have been clearer.  *For the consumer*, credit cards are instant.  If bitcoin transactions take 7-8 minutes to be confirmed ... I'm not going to want to stand there at the cash register and wait.
And yes, you could make the statement that the merchant *could* accept zero-confirmation transactions ... but think about what you're saying when you propose that to a merchant that's been processing credit card transactions for year, and gets a "confirmation" number from his payment terminal for each and every one.  I'm just failing to see the compelling marketing message for a merchant -- "*Hey, you know those near-instant transactions that you get confirmations for?  How would you like some nowhere-near-instant transactions that are confirmed, or instant transactions that are not confirmed ... instead?*"

Using that logic/assumption, I should wait until it runs up a couple thousand before I invest.
If the price is $300, and eventually goes to $100,000 - that's a $99,700 profit per coin.
But, if I think the risk is too high at $300 ... and that sub-$100 is a very very real possibility ... then perhaps I should wait to see slow steady growth through $1,000, $2,000 and $3,000 ... and *then* jump in since it would look far less risky.
My potential profit per BTC in that scenario is $97,000.  $97k, $99k ... largely the same to me ... but far far less risk in the later scenario for 1 BTC.

I don't know for certain -- but that opens up another problem.  If WU does $1bn USD profit annually having a dominant footprint in 1st world markets that have high per-capital incomes ... then it would be *even more difficult* for the remainder to be made up in emerging economies who don't have nearly the same per capita income.  i.e.: it's the "*family lives on $2,000 per year*" stories you always hear about emerging/developing markets -- that makes it *even more difficult* to make up that remaining $174bn USD when you start talking about economies that have 1/10th of the average income as the US and Western Europe.

You have a chicken-and-egg problem there.  Merchants that aren't emotionally committed to Bitcoin already as a hobby and/or ideology ... are unlikely to spend the time/effort to get payment processing going for a currency that 99.999999999% of the planet does not have.  Look at Wikimedia, they gave a big "FU" to bitcoin, because it's not worth the effort/overhead to process the payments.
Sure, some merchants like Overstock are having a play - they're the most interesting one.  Dell, however ... geeze, they're in the *business* of selling servers, of course it makes more sense for them to get you to loosen up a few coins from your wallet to do some more mining.


Possibly.  This is really the only market I think Bitcoin has a chance in, the Western Union type remittance/transfer market.  Local laws, however (and idiots on here asking "how can I launder my bitcoins?" earlier today) make the chances questionable.  And Western Union has spent decades building out their worldwide footprint - they will not go away overnight.  I'm skeptical "bitcoin" can build a network of 500,000 money transfer locations like WU has.


Sure, there is a history of emerging economies being able to leapfrog to latest technologies - i.e.: some countries that never had phone service until recently, jumping straight to cellular and never wiring up a POTS network.  But that's for a country that had no footprint of a *well-established, widely-used worldwide technology* - they can jump to the latest.  Bitcoin does not meet the well-established, widely-used bar ... so I have trouble seeing countries that have no banking ... jumping straight to Bitcoin.

In October 2015, there is a change taking place - but your statement above makes it sound like all fraud risk transfers to the business owners, in all scenarios.  **That is absolutely not the case.**
This has all been known for years.  Merchants that update their payment terminals, will not face any more risk than they have in the past.  [This article]( explains it well:






This will actually all be *very good for the payment card industry* overall.  Better, more secure terminals everywhere (Europe has had chip&amp;pin for years) means less fraud.  Thus, this will not be any watershed moment for Bitcoin.

Sure you can.
There are only two financial incentives in Bitcoin.  First, there is the miner block rewards - which is the dominant financial incentive today.  Then there are transaction fees.  Outside of other types of non-Bitcoin activities (i.e.: selling your data to marketers) these are the only two ways that people get paid money for plugging in a bunch of computing equipment to serve the Bitcoin network.
So, what if you remove the 1st incentive entirely and pre-mine all the coins?  Then, you're left with a network where financial incentives are only derived from transaction fees.  You've successfully split *half* of the "financial incentive" away.  This could be useful for a use case where a company or a group of companies might want to have a distributed encrypted time-certain ledger between themselves ... something that Hyperledger is designed for.

As a business, how are you imagining that would work exactly?
Forget BTC for a minute.  Let's say you have a full reserve bank branch in your neighborhood, and $1,000.  If you deposit your $1,000 with them, and they don't lend a single cent out ... how do they make money?  How do they keep the lights on in the branch, pay tellers to accept deposits/withdrawals, build a safe to hold all that physical cash, pay the accountants to keep track of things, etc.?
True, in a BTC economy some of those things aren't exactly the same ... but the core point is that *banking is not a zero-overhead endeavor*.  So, how does that bank pay for whatever amount of overhead it has?
It would have to charge you fees just to hold your money - that's the only structure that would seem to make sense.  If they charge you 1% annually for that your $1,000 become $990 at the end of year 1, $980.10 at the end of year 2, $970.30, etc. etc.  Just like inflation devalues a dollar, 100% banking would presumably decrease your BTC value.

Based on what?  Pulling a number out of your ass?
Anything up to the recent low of ~$275 or so, would be reasonable for a bidder who has no belief in Bitcoin whatsoever - they could immediately sell the coins on the open market and turn a ~30% profit in fiat.  True believers, however, would generally be fine with buying from $275 to probably 10-15% below the current market price ... so maybe $315 to $320 or so.

No, they're not.  I didn't ask you if the contract is 'valid' in your opinion - because I am painfully aware of your (and Lysander Spooner's) position on social contract theory.  


Fuck your youtube videos.  What is it with internet libertarians not being able to form their own words and sentences?  Sigh...
Anyway, I asked **you**, at 1 minute after launching out of your mother's private parts ... if you think we should ask you if you want to sign up for the "voluntary" "tenant contract" here in the US - i.e.: you pay taxes, but you get some services in return (as I mentioned above).
I *hoped* you would see the ridiculousness in that ... given that you wouldn't actually be able to answer one way or another.  You'd just be a screaming incoherent mess at 1 minute old (like all of us are).
So, we (as a society) extend you a "grace period" at which time you learn language and critical thinking skills (possibly at a school paid for by taxes from your parents).  During this time, a military force defends our borders from possible invasions ... FDA food inspectors inspect food processing plants to make sure your parents don't take home food that will kill you ... NOAA informs your parents whether a hurricane is approaching their town, so that you don't all drown, and can flee to safety if needed.  All these things cost $.  How long should we give you to learn enough to make an informed decision and eventually answer that question?  1 day?  1 month?  1 year?  1 decade?  Because what I sense you're eventually getting at -- is that you *shouldn't* ever be asked that question.  You should be able to just stay wherever you happened to fall out of your mom's uterus.


Wow.  Um, have you ever lived anywhere other than your parents' house?  Because that should be a pretty basic one that anyone who has ever signed a rental contract would understand.
But this is where it all comes around ... in case it wasn't clear, the "apartment" in this case ... is the United States.  Your parents (in this example) signed an *actual contract* with the property owner which had certain rules in it, services provided, and fees.  You don't suddenly get to squat in the apartment once they pass away ... just because *you* didn't sign it, because that would be violence against the property owner and thus a violation of the non-aggression principle.

Isn't fractional reserve an *inevitable outcome* of free market banking?  
Let's assume that bank A has $1,000 on deposit from their clients.  Bank A only loans out 10% of their clients deposits, and keeps 90% in reserve to service customer withdrawals.  If the bank manages to earn 5% in business loans, auto loans, mortgages etc. on that 10% (loaning out $100, keeping $900 in the vault) they make $5 that year.
Bank B also has $1,000 on deposit from their clients ... but they loan out 20% of their funds on-hand and keep 80% in reserve.  Let's assume they have the same skill as bank A in determining who is creditworthy, and cost structure on payment collection, etc.  Bank B makes $10 in the year.
If it takes $6 to open a new bank branch, bank B will expand faster and that gives them the opportunity to find more clients.  Now in year 2, bank B could have $2,000 on deposit from customers because they opened a 2nd branch in a new neighborhood - they will make $20.  Bank A with a single branch of depositors will only make $5.
At the end of year  bank A now finally has enough money to open their 2nd branch.  But bank B can now afford to open 4 more with the $4 leftover from year 1, and the $20 they just earned in year 2.
Lather. Rinse. Repeat. Bank A eventually has to compete and start loaning out 20% of their deposits, or they continue to get crowded out.  And so goes the race-to-the-bottom.

This is a fascinating assertion -- and sad that it is the most upvoted comment -- because you start out implying that 10% seems to be an *egregious* amount of fees for them to charge to have money available all over the world, in some of the poorest (and presumably high-crime as a result) locations known to man.  And then you admit one sentence later ... that you don't really *know* if anyone could have done it cheaper.
Maintaining piles of cash, in dozens (hundreds) of currencies ... all around the world ... dealing with potential counterfeiters and other types of fraud ... staffing brick and mortar locations ... all have obvious non-zero costs.  They've spent the past *163 years* figuring out what those costs are.

The conversion rate is unpredictable, no doubt.  There's no way to be sure how quickly merchants will update their terminals to support chip &amp; pin.  But from what I've been reading, the card processors are going to move aggressively to this system - to where the "weakest link" in the chain will bear the costs for fraud.  i.e.: once it's in place, as a merchant you can still stick with swipe processes ... but if the buyer had a chip &amp; pin capable card and you processed it with a swipe and a signature, and there's a fraud scenario, you're out 100%.  IMO, that will cause a lot of merchants to move quickly.

Um, [Square Cash](  I just "sent" my brother half of the cost of a Christmas present we were buying for my dad ... while we were both in the store.  And I didn't even need an "app" -- I just used the native email client on my smartphone.
Does it go direct from my checking account # and ABA number?  No, it goes through a debit card ... to his debit card.  So, the debit cards are an "overlay" to get around the direct bank-to-bank shortcoming ... but I don't see how that's any different from bitcoin being the "overlay" to get around that as well.
Furthermore, bank-to-bank transfers are possible ... just not instant.  My father was renting a property of mine for a few months ... I just gave him my account details (granted, he's a trusted party - so I wouldn't do that with just anyone) and he just set up his online banking to transfer the rental fees to me each month, for those few months.

Why do you assume they would use the *existing* blockchain (the one that starts with Satoshi's genesis block, a.k.a. Bitcoin) as opposed to just starting their own "WUCoin" system or something like that.
"*The network*" of 6,000+ anonymous mining nodes (many of which are in China) is not a compelling answer, IMO.  That scenario works well for TOR and pirating movies ... but *businesses* generally want to control the systems that they depend on.  So, were Visa/MC/WU ever to adopt a blockchain as a distributed ledger (for some reason I can't possibly fathom) I find it highly doubtful they would use the current Bitcoin blockchain.  They could just stand up a few hundred servers at 3rd party colo facilities around the globe (no need to get into the ASIC silliness), pre-mine a trillion "tokens" within a day ... and then just start using it as a transactional ledger.
@_date: 2015-01-07 19:10:29
Oh, absolutely.  Even if we knew the hot wallet balance *and* the cold wallet balance ... that's only one half of the ledger, and we'd have no idea whatsoever what is going on on the liability side.
But, "audits" are totes unnecessary ... or so Bitcoiners like to think.
The point being, though ... this guy should *know* roughly how much was in cold storage.  Even if he guesses low (to be safe) and says they have 150,000 when in reality they have 153,500 ... he *should* know what ballpark they are in.
The fact that this has not been communicated, says one of three things to me:
1) He doesn't actually know - which, frankly, should *terrify* Bitcoiners if that's actually the case
2) He does know, and he knows it's low ... and will start a panic when he eventually discloses it.
3) He does know, and is desperately searching for an exit where he doesn't have to disclose it ... but you can't just makeup fiat dollars OR BTC out of thin air to get out of this.  He can't go buy a bunch of BTC on Bitfinex to restock the cold wallet ... unless he has cash to do so.  And he can't just give some equity to some big BTC whale to bail him out, as he took VC money and they will be unlikely to sign off on being massively diluted.
They didn't even announce the hack until someone else figured it out (if I am reading everything correctly), so I don't know why I'm expecting this guy to step up to the plate and do what's right ... but at the moment they announced the hack, they should have at least put out some sort of guidance of what %age of their holdings that was.  "The hot wallet was compromised, 19k coins ... which is less than 5% of our holdings."  
But they didn't do that.
This is unlikely to end well.

How do we know that's their cold storage?
Certainly that's a large enough address to be the right one ... but I wasn't aware anyone was sure.
[Interesting history]( -- 200k coins in ... then some big transactions out (5k, 37k)?  And then just a lot of 10 and 100 BTC deposits in.  So it would seem that as of Dec 10th that address was able to have coins go in both directions.
If it's 134k coins remaining in there, that means ~14% of their BTC holdings were in hot storage ... which is potentially somewhat damaging to them.
It could go a *long* way to help them out - if they would announce they're moving 1BTC out from there ... and then do it ... to prove they actually have control over those assets.

That's how I'd do it.
How do I convince 90% of miners to suddenly and abruptly leave Bitcoin?  Give them something better, that pays more, right from the start, that existing ASIC hardware could mine.  Maybe I'd pay Western Union a few billion dollars to launch a "WUCoin" - a globally distributed transaction ledger, with several billion digital "tokens".  WU could pre-mine 90% of them, 10% would be left to the miners to mine over the next 3-5 years as a new "WUcoin" network of distributed endpoints all around the world came into existence.  Then, the miners could switch over to transaction fees instead of mining rewards.
Or, I'd rebuild the SWIFT network ... along those same lines.  SWIFTcoin.

And their transaction volume measured in USD had been going down for the past 12 months - so in recent months they weren't making nearly as much ... but other types of expenses (salaries, rent, servers) typically stay the same or increase over time.
Those are the types of things that you subtract from *gross profit* to get to *net profit*.  [Here's a handy guide](

*Based on what???!?*  Seriously, you don't just conjure $5m USD out of thin air.  And if they were making that much on transaction fees to have that laying around, they wouldn't have needed VC funding.
And you don't just conjure up 19k BTC either.  If they were still privately held, the CEO/founder could agree to hand over a giant chunk of equity to some BTC whale to get 19k BTC to give back to their customers ... *but they can't do that because they took VC money*.  VCs will not allow themselves to be massively diluted like that.
So please, *please* ... tell me why this is 'overwhelmingly likely' ... with real logic and reasoning.  Even if the CEO is the nicest guy in the world with the best of intentions, bad things happen to nice people - and the numbers here seem impossible to resolve.

*In my opinion*, if their hot wallet was 30-40% of their holdings, they're done.
There -- is that better?


But... *it is!*  You even said so in just the sentence before!  The existing investors would have to agree that "yes, send $5 out of our $10m to a hacker" is a good course of action ... as opposed to shutting it down and selling off the intellectual property to something else that might make them some ROI later on down the road.


I don't think anything I've stated is an unreasonable or unlikely outcome to consider.  I don't think it's unreasonable to criticize the CEO - especially in this situation - for being silent on how much is actually in cold storage.

IIRC, I thought others had found the 18-19k coins being stolen, before Bitstamp actually admitted how severe the problems were.


Sure.  Because talk is cheap, and no one has *ever* broken a promise in life (much less in Bitcoinland).  How on earth are they going to cover $5 million in losses?  Just because they got $10m from Pantera, doesn't mean that it can be allocated to cover that (or even that they got all $10 at once, if Pantera tranched the investment - which happens frequently).
And if VC money is used to cover a loss like this ... say goodbye to anymore VC/PE money coming into this space. 


No, they have not.  They didn't come clean about 19k coins being stolen until others figured that part out.  They did not disclose what %age this was of their total holdings other than a vague "majority" of their coins being in cold storage (a "majority" could be 20k coins).  
This guy **must** know off the top of his head, how much is in hot storage, how much is in cold.  If he doesn't, he's an idiot and shouldn't be in charge of the cash box for a lemonade stand.  And if he does know, and is intentionally *not* communicating that (I'm not sure why you withhold that information, if you're disclosing the size of the hot wallet) that is not a good sign at all, and a collapse is a very likely possibility.

This is what's really disconcerting -- sure we've heard about the ~19k coins in the "hot wallet" compromised ... and that the "majority" of customer's BTCs were in cold storage ... but that *could be* playing fast-and-loose with phrasing.  
If their cold storage holds 20-25k BTC ... that would *technically* constitute a "majority" of their customer's funds being in cold storage.  But if that's the case, then they are screwed.  
If their cold storage holds 350,000 BTC then their hot wallet was about 5-6% and they may live on after all.  (*EDIT*: It's worth noting that even MtGox [only apparently held ~200k coins]( at their implosion).
**But how on earth do you *not* know your cold storage number, so that you could easily communicate this to customers??!?**

They could have done that two days ago, *especially* to show the relative percentages of hot (lost, 19k) versus cold.  If it's 3-4% (which would mean BitStamp would have to be holding over 500,000 in cold) they just might survive this.  But if the hot wallet was 30-40% of their BTC?  Game over...

Nothing inaccurate - he's just pointing out that while bitcoin enthusiasts try to pretend that bitcoin transactions are "free" ... they're actually not.
They may be free to the buyer, they may be free to the seller ... but there is cost involved in the transaction.  Right now, miners pick up that cost for you.  They don't do it out of the goodness of their hearts ... they don't pay for megawatts of electricity just because they hate central banking.  They do it for money -- for the block rewards they get.

Then what use case does it really serve, that isn't already adequately met by other measures?
Serious question.  Let's assume that you're John Doe, and you have zero interest in:
* buying drugs
* buying CP
* committing tax evasion
* evading government capital controls
What value does Bitcoin provide to John Doe?  "It's a store of wealth"?  Yeah, so is my bank account ... or gold bars locked in my safe if I'm really paranoid.  "Instant transactions"?  My Amazon purchases are far more instant.  "Send money to a friend with no fees"?  Well, the "no fees" part isn't true for Bitcoin ... but PayPal and Square Cash do that for me on a regular basis.  "Mobile payments with your smartphone"?  Yeah, ApplePay is going to kill that (and will likely revive Google Wallet from near extinction).
This is what is holding back adoption - there is no real reason to *buy* Bitcoins, unless you need it for one of the purchases above ... or you have the typical libertarian/anarcho-capitalist "fuck government and taxes!!" mindset.  Seriously, think about Microsoft for a minute.  Assume you're John Doe and you got an Xbox One for Christmas.  Would you go to Microsoft's site to buy new content and just use your credit card ... or, would you go to a place like circle, and get a wallet, then transfer funds to that wallet, and wait, and then make your purchase (especially given if the price of BTC/USD went down in the timespan from when you funded your account, versus when you went to spend the money)?  No, of course you wouldn't.

Nice unrepentant cheerleeding there, Peter.


You don't find it the least bit disconcerting that Bitstamp ... now some ~96 hours after this all started ... has not:
* Brought their site back online in the original 24-48h they said they would
* Signed a message attached to the cold wallet, to demonstrate they still have full control of those coins
* Provided a rough number value on the coins in cold storage, so that clients can assess whether it is 1-2% of BTC holdings ... or 15-20% of BTC holdings that are lost?
Seriously - think about that last one for a minute.  Their founder/CEO *must* know - right off the top of his head - roughly how much they have in cold storage (if he doesn't, that's terrifying for a whole bunch of business reasons).  Yet they have made no statement at all to the market on this.  Why?  They've apparently got time to make other tweets, and [give their site "a little refresh"]( ... but they can't say something like "X00k coins in cold wallet confirmed in-tact"??
I could understand not hitting  (getting the site back up in 48h or less) if they'd done  and   But they haven't.  I'm betting in 3-10 days, their "temporarily offline" page changes to a "regrettably, we will not be able to resume operations" page.

Thanks.  I'm not sure where $2.4b is in that (I may not be reading it closely enough) -- but it does seem as though their trade volume in USD [was steadily declining over the past year](  
So their revenues have been smaller more recently, when presumably (?) their expenses might have been growing as they try to do more (hence the need for VC mid-year).
So I'm still not convinced they can pay 100% of this (or even 50% of this) out of cash-on-hand ... and I don't think the actual investors behind the VC fund will be so agreeable to letting their cash be used for this.

Sigh.  This is the "Oh, there's a potential fix in the wiki!" answer...
He changed a few lines of code in the software, and then found that you *could* reshuffle the previous blocks in the blockchain into the new 20-30Mb structure.  As someone who has spent decades in systems and software engineering, upgrading, etc. I can tell you that proving it's feasible is *worlds different* from actually figuring out how to do that on-the-fly with all of the existing miners (assuming you could get them to participate) ... and not disrupting the system in a potentially catastrophic manner.
Imagine if something went wrong with the "hard fork" and you ended up with two (or more) *different* blockchains as a result?  BTC would go to $0 overnight.
If you started a *new* altcoin with that codebase (BitcoinV2!) sure - it would work that way from day  with 20-30MB block sizes.  But retroactively restructuring the distributed ledger across thousands and thousand of discrete (non-coordinated) entities ... is just never going to happen.


So, the existing transaction rate going from ~4tps (I'm being generous) to 40tps - a 10x increase - will result in a 200x reduction in the costs of maintaining and running the network??  How?

I have no idea what you're saying here.  So, what - a WU employee is going to hack it from inside?  Seriously?  I've worked in IT for decades ... there are a fuckton of process, governance, and technical controls that can (and are) applied to financial systems on a daily basis to prevent insider threats.  And they work.
Seriously, where do you think concepts like multisig came from?  In IT we call that quorum-based authorization (i.e.: the twin "nuclear launch keys" in a submarine that are more than an arm's length apart from each other).


Now who is mixing topics?  Please, do me the favor of not arguing one-offs ... that because one company got hacked one time, that all companies (and banks!) get hacked.  And I should point out, you'll notice that Sony's bank account didn't get drained.


Perhaps I didn't explain this part clearly enough.  I'm not going to *fork* the current blockchain ... I'm going to use Satoshi's code to create a brand new blockchain (i.e.: an altcoin), with a new genesis block of my own ... and call it RINOcoin.  On day  there will be 1 miner - my laptop.  On day  there will be 13 miners - a dozen AWS servers all around the world, and my laptop.
Is that "more secure" or "less secure" than Bitcoin?  Cryptographically, I don't see how there's a variance - since it's the same code.  So that brings us back to the "*MOAR nodes is better!*" argument.


Right.  That's what RINOCoin would be.  


Ok, now instead of RINOcoin ... let's get back to where this all started and suppose Western Union decides they like blockchains, but hate Bitcoin ... so they decide to create WUCoin, on a new blockchain with its own genesis block.  Unlike points A) and B) you note above, they *will* care about it.  And let's say that they update the software that is already deployed to [100,000 ATMs worldwide]( to crunch away on WUcoin transactions during spare cycles when the machines aren't doing anything else (i.e.: helping a customer that is physically present in front of it).  Now the WUCoin network would have a cryptocurrency of their own, on trusted hardware and communication links (because Western Union has already sunk the costs to put the hardware and communication infrastructure in place to run those ATMs) with 100,000 processing nodes - 16x greater than Bitcoin.
So tell me again why WU starting their own blockchain would be doomed to failure?
@_date: 2015-01-07 18:01:14
Simply ... the fact is that securing stacks of cash all around the world - *especially in 3rd world countries* - has significant non-trivial costs, and this is something that Bitcoin (as a distributed ledger of numbers) does not "solve" in any real way.  The "last mile" in any infrastructure system is *always* the most expensive.  That's why WU has fees (which Bitcoiners seem to need to rail against as if it's somehow evil).
And here's problem 


What do you think will happen with these "free" transactions, when the block rewards continue to diminish over time?  Essentially, miners *subsidize* these 'free' transactions right now (with the 25 BTC reward that they get for running their hashing gear) but this goes away over time.  Right now, when you add in the miner subsidy, the "cost" per Bitcoin transaction is still [over $10](  So it costs $10 for that transaction to send the "family in the Philippines" some BTC.  It's just that *you* aren't paying it right now ... but you will be eventually.

Not really, no.  The intellectual property could be sold to another company in the Bitcoin ecosystem for some cents-on-the-dollar amount of cash, to get some of the money back.  Or, what happens more frequently is it is sold for a cash-plus-equity package in a different company who could leverage the intellectual property, which may return something more down the line to the original investors.
This shit happens all. the. time.


You have to think about the guys at Pantera, and understand what a "fund" means.  Pantera isn't just [these 10 individuals]( who fund things out of their pockets.  No, they do what's know as a capital raise.  When a VC/PE firm "raises money" for a "fund" ... they go and talk to a bunch of high-net worth individuals (anyone with over $1m in investable/near-liquid assets) and sell them "shares" in a fund.  So, in a $100 million fund that will get spread around a lot of companies, they might sell individual $100,000 "shares" in that fund ... to 1,000 doctors, lawyers, NBA players, whatever.  The point being, they go and *raise* that money from people.
And yes, they get a couple of "shares" in those funds as well... for doing all of the work.
What do you think their prospects are to continue their business and raise new funds ... when they have to defend the decision to use $5 out of $10 dollars worth of investors money ... to pay off some Eastern Romainian (guessing) hacker?  Effectively zero.
That's why I don't think VC money ever goes to make folks whole here.

In any "fixed + variable" equation ... as you go with smaller quantities, the "fixed" fee (which in my case, supports the cost of physically deploying and maintaining the ATM) will always be a larger percentage.

Translation - Bitcoiners who think that everything that ever possibly wants to use a blockchain (and therefore their coins will be heading to the moon *any day now*) are seriously deluded.

Can I mine EcuaCoins when that comes out?  No?  
Is it going to be a controlled, closed system ... where the state controls all the hashing nodes and can inflate the currency if they desire?  If so, then I fail to see how this is *any* different than the world today.  It's just a digital ledger/bookkeeping system at that point.
We already have "digital currency" -- it's called your bank balance.  It's the difference between the different "M" values in the monetary system -- actual physical bills and coins you can touch, versus the rest which is "digitally" represented by your bank balance.  When I swipe my debit card at McDonalds ... and $3.99 *digitally* goes from me to them (via Visa) ... that's the digital (as opposed to physical) movement of currency.

If I download [Bitcoin 0.9.3]( and start running it on a dozen Amazon Web Services servers around the globe, and call it RINOCoin ... how is that *less* secure than Bitcoin?
Is it cryptographically less secure?  I tend to doubt that, as it's the same code - but if there is a cryptographic weakness when fewer nodes are running, that would be interesting (I've not heard that before).
Is it less secure, because I am 1 person with only a few dozen servers around the globe?  Sure ... ok.  But, *less secure against what*?  I'm not going to fork my blockchain ... because I'm in control.  And I trust all the physical nodes and their locations because they are under my control.
If I'm a Western Union, I can probably afford to throw several hundred servers at it.  Heck, a decent sized Amazon Web Server instance is about $50 per month.  So I can stand up 100 of them in each region (I think they have 9 regions) and have a 900-node RINOCoin network, and it'll cost me less than $50k per month.  Is it "secure" at that point, when I have 900 distributed nodes?
This is why "*it's more secure!*" is a vapid argument (IMO) because it's simply a dick-measuring contest.  Yeah, so Bitcoin has 6,000+ nodes.  Do you think it needs 6,000 to be secure?  Could it be just as secure with 600?  
6,000 anonymous nodes when you're trying to torrent a file = very appealing

Voting is an interesting one.  And an inflationary blockchain, would basically just be a replacement for the Federal Reserve ability to manipulate the money supply.  
I'm not 100% convinced that plebiscite democracy is ideal, however.  [You can read up on some history]( on how Hitler used referendum to drive extremely oppressive policies.  There is a lot of concern that a 100% plebiscitary democracy would quickly fold to corporate interests with large marketing budgets ... that can simply campaign to voters to vote in ways which will harm them later (see California's prop 8 in regards to property taxes).

Ah, the old "*it's in the whitepaper, duh!*" response.  That's about as helpful as the answers to real problems like blocksizes not scaling being answered with "*there's a fix in the wiki!*".
So, in other words - not an answer.
Ok.  So, the *difficulty level* adjusts -- simply to make earning rewards harder (as Moore's Law marches ever forward).  "Making earning rewards harder" is not the same as "making it more secure", especially when you consider the scenario of if a "central bank" wanted to use a cryptocurrency.  They would deploy all of their own compute nodes, in their own facilities, to do so (not that I think any would even entertain such a ridiculous idea).  A blockchain can be just as "secure" with a couple hundred controlled nodes maintaining the chain in controlled facilities ... and that's exactly how a central bank or [SWIFT]( (who handle 173 financial transactions per second) would go about it.
It's clear you really don't have any clue what you're talking about - especially with comments like:


The the blockchain is *anything* but cost-efficient.  In fact, it's probably the most cost-inefficient transactional ledger on the planet.  3 transactions per second, real-world tops?

If a product is $100 via a normal merchant, and $98 via the Bitcoin merchant ... I would postulate that most people aren't really going to care about that $2 **in light of all the other items noted above** (wildly volatile, risk of permanent loss, etc.)  Heck - between the time I convert USD to bitcoin, to actually make that purchase ... the BTC price may have gone down more than $2.


I've always been puzzled by this ... perhaps you can help me out a bit.
In the several decades I've spent circling our sun, I have only had one occasion to open up a credit card dispute in my entire life.  It was from an eBay auction, for a "new in box" camera.  The seller's feedback was fine.  When the camera arrived - *a gift for my girlfriend at the time* - it was clearly NOT new.  The exposure counter already had a few hundred exposures on it, there was a nick in the corner of the casing clearly indicating it had been dropped ... and ... the best of all ... the previous owner had handwritten notes to him/her-self in the user manual regarding certain features.
It was a NYC camera seller.  Have you ever dealt with one before?  Let's just say, they just kept insisting that the camera was new.  So, in a BTC scenario ... how am I, *the consumer* ... protected?
One call to AMEX fucked up their transaction real good, and I got all my funds back.  If I'd paid that merchant with Bitcoin, they clearly would have told me to fuck off.  As an honest consumer, **why would I ever think irreversable transactions is a good thing?**


[QR-pay style apps]( are not anything new ... and on the smartphone front, Google has had Wallet for quite some time, and ApplePay will likely dominate (in some ways, ApplePay may actually be very beneficial to Google Wallet).

$0.088 per kWh (1.25MW/$80k) is good, but not great honestly.  You can find cheaper that that in industrial rates in the US.
However, their other numbers are what's most interesting.  
* The video states that it was October 2014 where they could mine 4,050 BTC per month for about $1.5 million dollars.
* They also vaguely stated they could mine over 100BTC/day before ... although 4,050 BTC per month would actually be 135BTC/day.
* $1.5 million divided by 4,050 BTC in a month (~135 coins per day), points to a coin price of * $370/coin ... that's close to where BTC was bouncing around back in October
* $1.5 million divided by 3,000 BTC in a month (~100 coins per day) would point to a BTC price of $500 which we haven't seen since August ... so it probably was ~135BTC/day - 4,050BTC/month - $1.5m / month.
If that's true, and now because of the difficulty rate increasing they can only mine 25BTC per day ... the math, at the current BTC price, gets very grim for them:
* 25BTC/day would be 750 bitcoins/month
* If we assume the current price as an average ($220ish) that means they're making just a bit more than $160,000/month.  Revenues are down nearly 90%.
* I'm assuming their electricity bills are still half of that at $80,000 (unless they started turning some rigs off)
* They (presumably) have rent, salaries, etc.
If all of that is correct above (are there any errors?) then my assumption is that this Chinese mine ... is now considerably **LESS** profitable at BTC prices ... at least, compared to where they used to be 6 months ago.
If we assume that "overhead" on top of power might be 20% (just pulling a number out of my ass) then if their revenue dropped to $96,000/month they'd start losing money.  $96,000 divided by 750 bitcoins (25 per day) would be a coin price of $128/bitcoin.

There are expert witnesses called into trials every single day, whom no one has ever heard of.
The defense failed (spectacularly) on three counts:
* Positioning AA as one of the smartest people on the planet rerarding Bitcoin (whether that is actually true or not).
* How testimony "about Bitcoin" would have any relevance whatsoever to Ross' guilt or lack thereof.  I mean, you wouldn't call an "expert witness" on Euros or Iraqi Dinars or iTunes Gift Cards if Ross' had chosen to run his business using those mechanisms to transfer value.  So the average juror just needs to understand that it functions like a currency.
* Describing the detailed testimony that AA would provide, which would help support the defense's theory.  This is the most dramatic failing from the defense attorney overall - there are much higher expectations for expert witness testimony, and documenting what that witness is going to testify to.

Forget the "DPR" name ... that's just a distraction ... they're just interested in the cashflow.  Oh, and that big time in the middle ... is apparently where every single bad thing on SR ever happened.  Nothing before then, nothing after then.
All the prosecution has to do (with the help of Ross' apparently very-incriminating diary) is prove that he had even one iota of involvement ... in that interim "*totes not involved!*" time ... to demolish the entire theory.  I think the prosecution has a pretty solid chance of making that case, based on the evidence they have presented so far.

"Bitcoin" is not on trial.  Whether Ross profited from drug money is.
You wouldn't call an expert testimony to trial, if Ross chose to perform his business in Euros, Iraqi Dinars or iTunes Gift Cards.  Therefore a "Bitcoin expert" - with *no specific or relevant knowledge of Ross' actions* is a complete and utter waste of the court's time.

Hell, she's practically written out a roadmap of "*well, a competent lawyer would typically do X, Y, and Z*" to underscore the fact that the defense - effectively has no case.

I'd disagree with the "to crash" part.  I totally agree on the buy side (Willy) ... I suspect it was done with completely fictitious dollars - i.e.: he was running a fractional reserve - especially since so many people just *left* their coins on MtGox.  
Once it broke $1,000 ... eventually some people probably decided they wanted to get out, and he couldn't just conjure up enough USD/EUR/JPY to pay withdrawals (like he could with Bitcoins) so he had to start selling BTCs (Markus).  And then it all just unraveled.
There may have been other contributing factors that helped, but I tend to believe that he thought (foolishly so) that he could inflate it in a controlled fashion, and then slowly exit out at high prices as long as enough other buyers came in to pick up the slack.  He'd be able to cover the fictional fiat used to make the purchases ... and some profit for him, too ... if it worked out the way he'd (IMO) planned.
It didn't work out as he had planned ... but I don't think his goal was ever to *intentionally* crash the price.
