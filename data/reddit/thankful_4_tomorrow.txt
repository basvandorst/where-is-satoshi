Why do people think both movement either up or down is always manipulation?

The type of person that says "taxes r theft" probably home schools their kids


Florida has no tax and toll roads


I dont know if that's true


Only in China right?
This type of person probably grows their own food anyway

This. People are still discovering Bitcoin all the time. In an American computer science class I was in, only 1/4 of millennial students raised their hands that they knew what Bitcoin was.

The analogy does not work, because the network effect of money is much stronger than the network of MySpace. There is no opportunity cost to move from MySpace to Facebook, as it is a free service and I can have my friends on both services. When someone has their life savings in Bitcoin, there is a great opportunity cost to move it into some riskier altcoin.

Are you an altcoiner or a nocoiner?

You keep hearing stories about "selling at the top", and "I'm smart because I sold at $19k, blah blah", but for everyone that sold at 19k, there are stories you don't hear about, like the guy that sold at $1k,2k,4k,6k,10k,11k, etc... and regretted it. Don't try to guess bottom or top. If you are bullish, hold. If you are not bullish, why are you invested in   Bitcoin in the first place?

Where'd you get 5 Quintillion? I thought the total value was around 500Trillion.

I did some math. So $100 bill is 10,000 pennies. So, if Bill Gates makes $36,000 / hr, it's not worth his time to pick up a $100 bill if he sees one on the ground. $46k/hr is $864k/yr or $315 million per year. So him, Warren Buffett, and Jeff Bezos, will all hurt their backs if they try to pick up that $100.

Yep, Bitcoin is already more stable than most other countries in the world. You actually would have made money in Venezuelan dollars in this crash.

$60K by 2020, and $1m by 2023.
This is based off the long term trend line that goes back to 2011.

Morty. You gotta turn into a car, Morty. You gotta turn into a Lambo, Morty. You gotta go to the moon for grandpa, Morty. Your grandpa Rick has borrowed money from some very powerful space aliens, Morty. You gotta turn into a Lambo, so I can pay them back, Morty. If I don't pay them back, you have no idea what they'll do to me, Morty.

McAfee is actually a smart guy if you listen to him in interviews. It's a shame he started shilling coins though.

Bitcoin has been a cycle of bubbles. Tulips was one bubble, Enron was one bubble and didn't come back. Bitcoin has come back after ever bubble crash. Not the same thing.

He's a professional liar. If anything, do the opposite of what he says.
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:19:40
Yeah, the real inflation rate is like 10%.

I'm Mr.Memestar, look at me!

The difference is, Enron, tulips, they go up ONCE then crash never to return. Where Bitcoin has been a series of ever increasing "bubbles", it's not a bubble, but rather frothy (volatility).

I'm confused. What's a Bitcoin Cash address?
