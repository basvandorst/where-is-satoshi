This man speaks the truth! I will take the sacrifice of buying all you bitcoin. Let’s start with a fair amount of $50 per BTC.
@_date: 2014-11-14 13:13:17
Stop while you still can. There is no end! ;-)
@_date: 2014-10-13 22:39:40
What site is that? It looks fancy!
@_date: 2014-08-16 22:03:41
I've done them all. 1 was a waist of time. 2 and 3 got me nowhere. 4, oh my god, 4 was the worst! Now trying to lick my wounds while being on 5.
@_date: 2014-11-14 17:38:26
That's the weird thing. 0 btc! You mine, but is never says how much bitcoins you make.
@_date: 2014-11-14 18:14:15
Ow yeah! Nice detail
@_date: 2014-12-29 21:08:07
Bitcoin is a beast! I guess there is only room for a few altcoins and Litecoin is one of them ;)
@_date: 2014-11-14 13:53:41
Don't! You can do so many better things with your time. Like clipping your toenails!!
@_date: 2014-12-24 18:46:35
I've send CoinDesk a message/tip about this. Great stuff for an article. I hope they will give the whole MillionaireMakers some exposure.
@_date: 2014-11-14 13:52:02
I don't think so. Correct me if i'm wrong
@_date: 2014-10-13 22:43:39
Nice, thanks!
@_date: 2014-09-12 08:23:15
Did it! :)
@_date: 2014-12-30 21:16:43
Thnx! I guess next year again
@_date: 2014-12-25 09:05:21
Merry Christmas!
@_date: 2014-08-17 09:56:04
Obviously i'm not a native English speaker. But yeah, it was a big fat Paula Deen kind of waist!
@_date: 2014-11-14 15:03:21
No, not again! 
@_date: 2014-12-30 20:12:15
Make a random Redditor a millionair off course! 
@_date: 2014-11-14 13:02:01
Who said the addictive games are also the good ones? It has a ton of ads, but hey, you want the bonuses! ;-)
@_date: 2014-12-24 21:29:20
That's crazy and kind of sad. No, i'm NOT planning to pay them, ever.
@_date: 2014-08-20 21:11:03
A crash?
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:09:19
The Bitstamp stand looks closed.
@_date: 2015-01-05 16:53:19
Bad news after bad news you say? TO THE MOON!!!
@_date: 2015-01-06 17:47:42
Bitstamp! They could use all the charity right now ;)

Yes. Just moved my last coins.
@_date: 2019-01-02 14:55:54
Good, that’s a good sign!
@_date: 2019-01-01 00:05:10
Welcome in 2019! That this will be a profitable year for all!
@_date: 2019-01-07 19:38:24
Why is that? Because it will dip again? Done that, been there.
@_date: 2019-01-29 21:46:00
When cigarette?
@_date: 2019-01-02 07:49:47
Within Bitcoin or the stockmarket?
@_date: 2018-12-12 07:04:58
Investing into Bitcoin really builds character, doesn’t it? Phe
@_date: 2018-12-25 09:25:00
It’s a small but sour dip
@_date: 2018-12-30 13:59:03
Bartception. It’s Barts all the way down...
@_date: 2018-12-12 13:53:03
With Bitcoin it feels like both.
@_date: 2018-12-29 08:09:11
Newbie here. What does that mean?
@_date: 2018-12-31 20:32:01
I sure hope so
@_date: 2018-12-14 11:09:38
Ok, so what are your arguments?
@_date: 2018-12-19 12:06:02
Elon Musk just called. He said: “to the motherfucking moon bitches!”
@_date: 2018-12-30 14:45:23
Ow shit, that’s a very expensive mistake 
@_date: 2018-12-25 09:12:38
@_date: 2018-12-12 13:52:25
You would like that, don’t you? No, i’m not ‘losing’ money at this moment.
@_date: 2018-12-25 12:01:58
Yeah, i switched from being a day trader to a hodler. So i never kept my money online longer then a few days/weeks. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 15:40:59
It shure is!
@_date: 2018-12-29 08:07:26
So it pukes every 10 minutes? Hahaha what a living.
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:18:26
I don’t think we’re going to the moon yet. But i feel like celebrating today. So: yeeehaah!
@_date: 2018-12-30 21:27:08
I always upvote fan art. Nice work!
@_date: 2018-12-14 06:29:44
Hahaha, this is gold! Thank you for the laugh.
@_date: 2018-12-30 18:23:51
Did somebody say Batcoin?
@_date: 2018-12-31 15:11:36
That’s a LOT of money. A good start!
@_date: 2018-12-30 14:46:38
He mixed up the transfer amount and fee amount. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 11:45:38
Please read my story again :)
@_date: 2018-12-19 09:47:58
That’s not true. There are many options.
@_date: 2018-12-31 17:55:45
That’s a awesome story! Congrats my man, enjoy!
@_date: 2018-12-21 07:01:31
That’s awesome! I love it!
@_date: 2018-12-28 17:23:10
$4750, so that’s not so far away
@_date: 2018-12-25 11:47:28
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-12-25 11:47:20
Wow, thank you!
@_date: 2018-12-17 11:02:57
Seeing a lot of love for Litecoin in the charts. Is it warming up for the upcoming halving?
@_date: 2018-12-29 07:26:17
Yesterday was fun! Let’s keep this up the upcoming day / weeks / months / years... hehe
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:05:24
This is bitcoin, these extreme movements happen all the time. In 99.99% we’ll never know the reason why. Except when I’m buying, then the price will drop. ;)
@_date: 2018-12-20 11:54:54
I think you are right. It does feel ‘explosive’. People know what the price can do, we know that the userbase has grown. The tech and availability are getting better and better. For my feeling the next hypecycle will be a huge one! 
@_date: 2018-12-31 15:14:24
I know that feeling. I also should do this
@_date: 2018-12-21 23:21:38
Welcome onboard!
@_date: 2018-12-26 19:20:43
Good thing i bought high and sold low.
@_date: 2018-12-27 19:35:14
Good! That's another vulnerability they found and can patch.
