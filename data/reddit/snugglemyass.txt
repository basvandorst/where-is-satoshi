Nice clickbait title. I bet your site really sucks if you need to lie to get clicks. 
@_date: 2014-10-02 02:10:53
You beg in real life for money as well? Like on the corner and shit?
@_date: 2014-09-30 01:17:33
Just don't use the search. Instead start a new topic. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 00:51:30
No. This has not been discussed before. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 01:18:56
Please, just stop with these posts. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 21:47:27
Do you know anything we don't? Saying we'll be back in 24 hours 3 days ago and then nothing isn't exactly a good sign. They could at least update that page. Many people must be close to pissing their pants now. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 02:24:46
You want to buy bitcoins with your cc. This is the result. Seems mostly like normal fraud prevention to me. 
Buying coins with a cc is extremely risky for them. I'm amazed they actually pulled it off. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 10:18:25
You are right. It is a problem. I can send 5 bucks for free through my bank account. With Bitcoin it would cost me money. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 16:07:32
No, only the 6 people before you who posted about it. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 15:19:25
Well in the end it's just like stealing money so yes, profit is a very likely
motive :)
Especially when we're talking about the bigger guys with botnets etc. obviously that is just to make money. 
@_date: 2014-10-02 11:45:41
Yes we know. It was originally posted here, over a week ago. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 07:10:10
You don't believe this nonsense yourself right?
@_date: 2014-09-30 03:18:23
Expert chartists...
@_date: 2014-09-27 03:35:01
Not this shit again. 
@_date: 2014-10-01 05:10:17
Do we really need 10 of these posts a day?
@_date: 2014-09-25 23:18:23
Seriously, a honest question, can those who downvote me give me their reason?
All i said it wasn't on the "new" page because it moved down already. This isn't a lie, it isn't insulting, it isn't even negative. Just an observation. A fact. 
What did i possible say that makes you go "fuck that guy, i'm gonna downvote him to hell". 
Really, i'm so curious what goes on in the mind of people who downvote comments like this. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 14:03:47
Just what we need. Even longer confirmation times. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 22:19:54
@_date: 2014-10-02 20:53:14
These kind of posts are getting more retarded by the day. 
I just hope this is a troll. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 00:01:36
Yes. It's a secret message that tells you to use the search. 
@_date: 2014-10-02 01:34:27
He knows nothing more about crypto currencies and where they will go than my broke 18 year old brother. His opinion does not matter. So maybe after it's been posted about 10 times now we can stop. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 16:05:21
Riiight. Your crystal ball told you so?
@_date: 2014-10-04 08:52:37
If you did a search then why don't you know the answer? It's been explained 20 times already. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 05:45:51
Ok stop it now. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 18:20:02
You are buying shit. You are pissing your pants and made this post to act like nothing bad is going on. 70 people before you did the same thing. It's getting boring. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 08:06:58
You don't know this. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 05:27:32
Because a lot of people have a lot of money invested and like to know what is happening to their money? It's completely normal to try and figure why exactly you are losing money. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 08:09:09
Don't reason with this guy. Look at his post history. He is known here as a completely delusional idiot. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 22:28:04
No you don't. Stop lying. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 22:18:21
Can something be done about these posts? It's getting ridiculous. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 01:49:45
You dumb kids were quiet for a long time. Please keep it that way. Stay on your own sub. You don't see Bitcoiners spamming your kindergarten all the time. Just stop being annoying kids. 
@_date: 2014-09-25 17:45:44
Wow. How come nobody ever thought of this!
@_date: 2014-09-26 11:18:00
Bullshit! Stop lying. Every thread says the same thing. That it isn't a problem. And every point of yours is answered dozens of times. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 15:09:11
Not a scammer but i can tell you most of the small time scammers are kids. Usually kids with little social life. Bullied at school. Not much real life friends. A lot of this hacking/scamming gives them the idea that they are in power. They are getting back at the world. They feel no remorse stealing from innocent people because they feel they are treated bad as well. 
This is typical of the small time scammer who manage to hack/scam someone out of a coin here and there. 
The bigger guys i don't really have a profile for. Just criminals trying to get rich i guess. 
@_date: 2014-10-02 22:43:57
That usually never happens here. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 05:35:09
Who's talking about a quick buck?
There are people who bought almost a year ago at 1200. I can totally understand that they are trying to find a reason for the price drop. 
This isn't about making a quick buck. This is about people losing money. Yes even if you don't sell. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 01:20:45
Yes. Try reading the article. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 12:05:48
Amazing how you can't read either. And neither the people who upvoted you. 
@_date: 2014-10-01 05:13:01
You could easily have posted in the main topic about this. But you feel your opinion is more important than that. 
Let me explain you something. It isn't. 
@_date: 2014-09-25 19:15:21
That comment is downvoted why exactly? 
@_date: 2014-10-03 14:00:24
Hype and half truths get upvoted and anything reality gets rejected. Typical of this sub. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 04:37:29
Yup. You got downvoted. You are not allowed to say such things here. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 21:51:25
Another deadline pulled out of thin air. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 19:32:38
The next person who posts that quote (that Gandhi never said) should be kicked in the nuts. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 01:17:08
You really didn't notice it's bitcoins and not bit coins?
@_date: 2014-10-03 21:00:10
I wonder why nobody talks about this. I have money there and i'm worried. I can't be the only one. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 06:29:51
Wow. I can't believe nobody thought of this before. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 07:39:09
To the downvoters. When you downvote me can you please explain why and where i'm wrong. Thanks. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 20:50:41
Use the search man. This has been answered 100's of times. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 21:44:45
Yes. We know. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 21:49:09
And because it happened 3 times it will always happen? Your logic can't be that simple?
@_date: 2014-09-24 18:37:37
Do you beg for money in real life as well? Like on the corner of the street?
@_date: 2014-09-28 20:48:00
Stop spamming. You already posted this. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 08:51:14
Who exactly do you expect to answer that? Do you think anyone here can look into the future?
@_date: 2014-09-25 17:04:17
Take a guess. Was this posted already yes or no?
@_date: 2014-09-25 21:58:44
That 50 people before you posted exactly the same thing and it's annoying as hell. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 01:37:44
Uh no. Go away. 
@_date: 2014-10-02 10:16:19
Is this another "let's pretend there is nothing wrong and Bitcoin is about to explode" post like i've been seeing 15 times a day lately?
@_date: 2014-09-28 22:39:07
No, not the first. Tons of people here begged for money.  Actually someone did 3 posts ago. It's sickening. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 17:56:28
AaaaaaaahaaaaahhhhHAHHHHHHAAAAhahhaa. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 17:15:34
You know damn well you need to pay a fee or it can take days for your transaction to go through. You sound like a sleazy car sales guy. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 18:25:18
Yes it is when it's asked at least 70 times already. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 06:29:26
He's right. It's getting annoying. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 01:59:50
Go back to your own sub, kiddo. You don't see us spamming Bitcoin there. Just...grow up or something. 
Also, here is a tip. You will never...i repeat never get rich off the 50 bucks in Doge you own. No matter how much you spam and think you're doing awesome PR. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 02:19:53
The fact that most likely you can't afford half a coin says enough. I also realize you are trolling so i will stop feeding you. 
@_date: 2014-10-02 15:54:58
You must have one shitty life. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 02:48:06
I have no problem with Dogecoin or is its users (as long as they stay in their own sub) but most of you are children. Why deny that? I think the average Doge user is 16. How does that make me a douche?
@_date: 2014-10-01 21:29:38
You seriously, even for 1 second, think this will work? How old are you?
@_date: 2014-09-30 19:33:42
Troll. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 06:41:55
You're so l33t. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 17:51:45
We had no idea. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 15:02:15
Why the hell do comments like this get downvoted? What is wrong with people!
@_date: 2014-09-27 01:32:09
Nice spam. Reported. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 21:44:52
Past few weeks. Uh...
@_date: 2014-09-29 13:02:17
Next month, right?
@_date: 2014-09-24 10:54:34
Did you really think this wasn't posted already?
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:48:18
Thanks. We almost missed the 15 other posts about it. 
@_date: 2014-10-02 21:07:11
And another completely worthless topic. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 00:41:29
You are only the 56th person to post this. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 16:51:13
Maybe they downvote you because a simple search could have shown you the 100's of topics about it. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 06:01:30
Sure. Investors are known not to care about their money. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 21:13:26
Hilarious how you got downvoted. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 02:46:02
No. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 08:54:23
Weird. Not wierd. Why is this word so extremely difficult for people?
@_date: 2014-09-30 05:47:16
Stop spreading bs. Just like the rest of us nobody has any idea if it will go up to 700 again. Nobody!
And to the OP what makes you think people here can look into the future?
@_date: 2014-10-04 09:35:46
I need to know where you get your weed. 
@_date: 2014-09-25 17:04:58
No. 
@_date: 2014-09-25 23:39:27
No if you are a normal, sane person. 
Yes if you are a delusional bitcoiner. 
Take your pick. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 10:02:12
@_date: 2014-09-26 19:59:33
Lets do the same image for this year. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 08:56:08
@_date: 2014-09-25 19:00:10
Yes we know. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 15:34:49
Very convincing. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 14:04:49
Keep telling yourself that. 
Seriously, when you talk nonsense like that do you even think about what you're saying?
@_date: 2014-09-30 19:28:07
You get a job, make money and buy coins or try to get paid in Bitcoin directly. Crazy, i know. 
@_date: 2014-09-25 19:01:25
It's old news. That's why it's not on the "new" page. 
@_date: 2014-09-28 23:24:48
If you'd understood even basic economics you wouldn't be saying stupid stuff like that. 
@_date: 2014-09-25 15:31:42
I always love the "here is why" posts. They never actually show any proof. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 10:51:02
I think this has been asked and answered close to 70 times. Any reason why you refused to use the search?
@_date: 2014-09-24 08:56:34
I'm talking about Kitthecar. Not the person i responded to. Why the hell is he getting downvoted? He's pointing out a very valid point in this retarded topic. I guess that's not allowed here?
@_date: 2014-09-26 00:38:47
It just occured to me that you treat me as an outsider. Someone who doesn't understand Bitcoin. Or someone who doesn't like Bitcoin. 
I notice this a lot here. If you say anything else than 10k by next year then many here think you are a shill, a troll or just anti Bitcoin in general. 
The fact that there are people who love Bitcoin but also can be critical and prefer reality over fantasy is something people like you don't seem to consider possible. 
@_date: 2014-10-02 22:55:11
Check the date on your computer screen. Bottom right most likely. 
@_date: 2014-09-25 18:27:30
What does it take to stop the 200 daily reposts here?
When you submit a link like this at no point do you think "it might be posted already"?
@_date: 2014-09-25 23:35:57
You cry a lot. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 00:00:37
Ok, it's clear which category you belong to. 
Listen, Facebook isn't gonna start accepting Bitcoin anytime soon. Maybe in the future, who knows. Now, no. Get back in reality. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 16:37:08
Look man. It's a week old news. There were 5 topics about it on the mainpage and about 300 on the "new" page. The price already went up and down. 
If something as big as Paypal accepting Bitcoin is in the news you can't possibly think you're the first to post about it?
@_date: 2014-10-03 20:58:04
It's always about the price but when we go down i have to read 15 posts a day how it's not about the price. Give me a fucking break. 
Bitcoin is worth less every day and it sucks and it's bad for Bitcoin and 99% of the people care about the price. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 07:18:04
Don't listen to people like him. He has no clue whatsoever what the price will do and if it ever goes up again. Nobody does. He just doesn't want you to sell because his 2 coins will be worth less. 
People like him are the reason outsiders call this a ponzi. Which of course it isn't but bitcoiners sure make it look like one at times. 
Talk to a financial adviser. Don't get your advise here. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 04:04:10
I see you did your research. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 17:17:17
No, thank you! Only about 70 people before you posted they got their circle invite. Thanks for starting another one!
@_date: 2014-09-30 05:38:34
To a serious investor the price is very relevant. 
@_date: 2014-09-25 23:22:35
It often doesn't work and when a story breaks usually 20 different sites copy and paste the same news so most likely it's already posted through another site. 
Just do a quick search for a keyword either on the last 3 pages or so on through the search box. Takes no more than 10 seconds and it will stop the insane amounts of reposts. 
@_date: 2014-09-25 23:14:40
Crazy how Bitcoin turns people into beggars. Suddenly it's normal for people who don't live on the street to beg for money. 
Some people just have no shame. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 02:13:49
You really thought this has not been posted before?
@_date: 2014-10-04 08:49:30
No, it isn't. Period. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 17:55:56
And how do you prevent that? I mean lets say you use Bitcoinqt and t gets added to your total amount of coins. How do i avoid sending that specific Satoshi next time i transfer coins?
@_date: 2014-09-27 02:29:38
I hate scammers and it sucks you got scammed but this was so easy to avoid. Sorry, very stupid move. 
@_date: 2014-10-02 11:16:35
Because nobody feels like buying something that's been going down in value for almost a year. Not exactly rocket science. 
Would you tell your mother to buy something that you know will be worth less tomorrow. No, you wouldn't. Yet most people here expect other random people to do it. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 20:16:13
Must read! 
No, not really. 
@_date: 2014-10-02 15:56:40
How is this comparable to gold?
@_date: 2014-10-04 14:06:20
Keep telling yourself that. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 15:16:41
Yes, we're talking about a lot of 15, 16 year olds here. Many of them also consider it some sort of game. They are too young to understand how serious some situations can be. They don't understand that someone might lose his house or car or whatever because of their l33t lulz wins. 
Or the kids who hack and destroy random sites to show how cool they are. That site can be someone's work. His income. His life. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 22:16:40
Just ignore the top topic on the Bitcoin sub mainpage and start your own. Because your opinion is important like that.
@_date: 2014-09-24 10:19:44
First of all yes you can send these small amounts with most payment systems and second you can't read. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 21:07:25
Why exactly will the price always recover? Who told you that?
@_date: 2014-09-30 15:30:54
I actually hope Amazon won't accept Bitcoin anytime soon. I prefer not to have another round of dumping. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 05:20:15
It's spam. She's trying to make 25 bucks for referring people. 
What is so obvious according to you?
@_date: 2014-09-26 03:53:15
Moron. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 01:48:56
Do a chargeback. 
@_date: 2014-10-02 22:41:05
Wow tell me more! 
@_date: 2014-09-24 12:08:03
And you got downvoted for explaining that. These people are just so weird. 
@_date: 2014-10-04 02:12:09
Troll. 
@_date: 2014-09-26 02:09:56
So if i say they won't accept it now but might in the future i'm a nay sayer and you disagree with me. 
Then i wonder what you disagree with. You are saying they are gonna accept it now? Want to make a little bet in that case. Through escrow?
@_date: 2014-09-30 19:24:25
Let me check my crystal ball. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 08:24:22
Wrong sub. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 05:49:00
Oh ok. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 10:34:41
Can those who downvote me also please tell me why. What did i post that is worth a downvote?
@_date: 2014-09-30 19:26:37
You're seriously the 250th idiot to post that quote in the last year or so. 
And where we are always changes. 
And Gandhi never said that you dumbass. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 06:36:57
Amazing how people just keep buying these things. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 18:11:25
Ok thanks. 
@_date: 2014-10-02 11:18:52
Where have i heard that before.
