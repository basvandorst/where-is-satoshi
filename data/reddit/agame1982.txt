Wow great lecture. People still look at me funny when I bring up bitcoin. The Midwest doesn't have as high of an adoption rate as the west coast. I liked how he discussed all the other uses of blockchain technology. Very informative.

Yes it's volatile, so surprise there.

Yea I don't get it. Did he literally die or something?

I was worried on my first purchase. It just takes like 5 business days. The price is pegged to when you bought it, so they aren't doing any market timing. I'm pretty sure that would cause some boycotting.

Thanks! All good info. The "documents" section on electrum is geared towards PC users and it is a little confusing setting up the external/offline wallet because the instructions don't jive with my interface. Also, I've had like 2.5 bourbons. For now, I've backed the seed and app with all accompanying files up to a thumb drive and a 1TB external drive. I feel a little better. One question-- I've heard it is useful to download the entire blockchain. Is that true? I mean, won't it be out of date in like 2 seconds? I guess if it encompasses all of my transactions, it would be useful. Still learning.

So can the people circumvent that law by the very nature of bitcoin? They'd have to outlaw the internet to stop bitcoin, right?

Thanks for the suggestion. $900! woo hoo!! One more nube question. I transferred my balance from coinbase to electrum. There was like a .00018 BTC fee (when I view the blockchain info), but the balance I transferred was the exact balance that I received. Who paid the fee?
