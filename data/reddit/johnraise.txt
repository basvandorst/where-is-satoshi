if you actually knew any successful people, you would realise that loving your job gives you an edge in any saturated marketplace. loving what you do = being more in demand = charging more = BEING RICHER THAN OTHER AVERAGE JOE'S (LIKE YOURSELF)

if they ask for the other 2 refunds back, you are probably obligated under law to give back the excess. if they don't ask, they don't care

obviously keep the 5 refunds you dope. I tried booking through expedia and it didn't offer a bitcoin option.

joe rogan? really though?
my best advice to you is to take a walk up and down the aisles of the biggest, most majestic, library near you and take a few hours to learn something. ANYTHING.

why do people like you procreate? why? do nothing but suck resources from earth and give zero back. I hope those who benefit from crypto donate their funds not to lambo bullshit but to science research centres, whose scientists spend 60% of their time writing grant proposals rather than using their knowledge to create the next big discovery. I'm so sick of losers

'those people' who actually LOVE THEIR JOBS will actually be successful enough to not be working until they die so their kids can get a useless certificate

if I love my job, then yeah, why not? lazing around batting my eyelashes at my wife doesn't appeal. I want to be learning and experiencing life to the fullest. for me that doesn't include listening to joe rogan, but reading and listening to people who work to solve higher problems/issues. I guess it's hard to explain. some people want to aim higher, use their intelligence. others want to submit to hedonistic physical pleasures, avoid thinking about anything. I just think we're on this planet for some reason, and that reason isn't to waste away doing bugger all every day.

wrong. imagine there are hundreds of candidates for an entry level position in a company. if you do your due diligence and learn how to proceed to the next level of authority, either you will get a promotion or you'll be in demand at another firm. 
following orders is part of many jobs. but it's up to the person, the worker, to learn additional skills that will make them desirable for promotion. I work in the legal industry, so I see lawyers who up-skill by becoming accredited mediators, or those who learn Python or other programming languages, or even those who study a different area privately, these people advance higher. that's in the structure of an organisation though.
as for smaller businesses, trade labour or soon-to-be automated areas of work, well, someone who loves what they do knows the ins and outs of the industry always has an advantage.
my ultimate point is that if someone simply goes to work, hates their job, doesn't think outside the box or how to climb the ladder, they will always be stuck with a certain pay grade. those who constantly strive for more, stoking the embers of whatever interests them about their job, will almost certainly be paid more than those who shut off and complain that life and society is shit. life is really what you make of it. it's even tougher for women so it just depresses me to see other guys complaining. no one is going to give anything out on a plate, you have to earn your keep
