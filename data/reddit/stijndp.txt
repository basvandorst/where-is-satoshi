A stock is an actual part of a company. If you buy a TSLA, you can tell your friends Elon uses the pen you own or whipes his but with the toilet paper you own. If the company goes bankrupt, you're also the highest on the ladder as an individual person can be to get something back out of it. Often you can also expect dividends on the stock as a thank you because your investments made the company able to make a bigger profit.  
When bitcoin falls, there is nothing left but a worthless file. If you buy bitcoin, you don't own anything. It's worse than playing the gold market because at least there you actually own gold.  
The only real winners with bitcoin are the brokers and they are the smart ones. There's also a few lucky ones. And there's a ton of people who are going to be left wrecked with hopefully not a too expensive life lesson.

It's just playing an exchange rate on an unregulated stock market so far and there is no indication at all it will change any time soon.  
As long as there is no bitcoin cash, it will never be an accepted currency. So far it's being pushed by a small amount of people comparable to a phenomenon like  but other than that there are no real backers or securities.  
It's commendable that it's lasting this long and a few people are getting rich but at the end of the day many more people are one day going to be left devestated. And the few who got rich from it will act like they were just the lucky ones.  
You don't have coins of bitcoin in your wallet. Your baker doesn't sell a 0.0002 BTC loaf. Amazon doesn't sell a 0.14 BTC barrel of lube. Bitcoin has never shown it wants to be a currency so it never will be.
