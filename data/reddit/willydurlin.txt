That’s money laundering, which is a crime.  And yes I’m a lawyer.  No bad intent but I would not do this.

I’m not sure you need to understand the tech like Satoshi in order to recognize that the idea is brilliant.  But you’re right, it might not work out.  Not every genius idea does.

I like Mr. MM in general but didn’t think this was a very thoughtful analysis.  
He has a pretty strong independent streak so part of me is surprised that he didn’t see any possibility for bitcoin.

What happens on the 17th?
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:15:45
I’m no expert.  But it seems to me that prices drop on gdax when the volume is low.  When volume spikes, do does the price.  Not sure if others have noticed the same thing. 
What do people think will happen on then 17th if prices remain relatively stable from now until then?

Once bitcoin has “tangible utility” each bitcoin will be worth a million bucks. Yes, you’ll still be able to buy in, just not very much (unless you’re a reach marine creature). But you’re right, at this point it’s not fully developed.

He also admits that he missed out on amazon and google. In other words, he admits he doesn’t know everything. He has a strategy and sticks to it.

I clicked on it.  Not very good.  Ignore this clown.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:37:48
Why is that a dumb comment?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:34:49
Interesting question.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:53:38
This is exactly right.  The public consciousness has been infected.  Tons of people now understand the technology and purpose.  There is no doubt it will go up again.

Question from a noob - I transferred my bitcoin to my TREZOR last night from Coinbase.  The transfer went through and I see the bitcoin on my TREZOR.  But when I check the public address it shows up as empty.  Does it just take more to time for the transfer to be confirmed before it shows up on the ledger?
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:32:49
I support this.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:25:00
What a fake post
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:24:32
Or does this have something to do with Coinbase being offline?  Even though my TREZOR wallet said I received the funds. ETA : thanks for any guidance.  Much appreciated.

Upvoted.  I def recognize the panini.

When are you buying?
@_date: 2019-02-14 15:40:43
There is supervised release, which is essentially the same thing.  But  it if you get life, I don’t think.

Institutional money hasn’t even started getting in.

Very sad.  Obviously a miserable person to come on and troll.  Get a life man.

People always ask this.  You need to distinguish the present from the future.  Right now it’s an investment.  Draper is saying that in five years, people will only use crypto.  People won’t be changing fiat to crypto because there won’t be any fiat. That’s why he says the barista will laugh at you if you try and pay with fiat.

The volume is dead because everyone is on the sidelines waiting to buy in at lower level.  People haven’t forgot about all the price predictions of 90k in 2 years, etc
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:42:22
You are selling at the bottom.  The best investments are hard to make.

He’s not underwater.  He bought at like 1k USD per btc I think.
@_date: 2018-03-10 05:02:15
Lol this is great.  
@_date: 2018-03-29 00:16:03
Totally agree.  The comparisons with yahoo and MySpace are terrible.   
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:23:01
He just posted the exact same comment on the trader sub.  He’s just trying to spread FUD.

Many (if not most) of the traders on r/bitcoinmarkets think the price is going down.  But there’s plenty of them that get wrecked while trying to short the market.  They get so angry that the price hasn’t crashed that some have convinced themselves that whales are artificially propping up he price.  I also see some of them come over here and tell everyone to sell because the market is crashing- hoping to incite fear and panic. It’s crazy.  Bottom line, nobody knows what the price of bitcoin is going to be in the short term.  Unless you are a skeptic (and somehow think the price is going to 0), the best advice for a lay person is to Hodl.  The price will rise more than it will fall, so the odds aren’t in your favor if you sell.  Just my opinion.

Why is this an indication of more pain?  Looks positive to me.
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:46:01
Buy when others are fearful.

There’s been claims that the exchanges keep their money in btc and have been gradually selling btc to cover taxes.  They might know what they owe but have still been selling.
