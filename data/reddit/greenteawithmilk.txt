I wish more ATMs had two-way transactions (cash&lt;-&gt;bitcoin). There are a few out there that do bitcoin-&gt;cash, but not nearly enough, like a localbitcoins on autopilot. I would use the hell out of that.

They also hit a YTD new low. That's bitcoin for you!

Wow, can't believe they showed this on CNBC.
I got annoyed at the dinner table the other day when some family members were chortling about how bitcoin had dropped 25% in a day, echoing the latest TV news. Of course, I kept my mouth shut, but I was thinking, who cares, it just went up more than 200%. Such a stupid headline.
I guarantee this guy has bought bitcoin. I get weird jealousy vibes from those who haven't, like they take pleasure in any negative news about bitcoin - somehow justifying that they missed out and decide to continue to miss out.
Now, there are altcoiners who hate bitcoin with a passion, but that's a whole different story.

Military/national-grade data mining and intelligence services.

Thiel's got his mind on his money and his money on his mind. First PayPal, now Bitcoin.
His Palantir stuff is scary cool.

Last week's crypto comic gave you a shoutout: 
For charities, have you considered mental health organizations? Although things are better in the US, there's still way too much stigma and untreated suffering. Money has been pouring into the usual science glamor projects or trendy cancer fundraisers for decades, but they have very little to show. Mental health may be an under-served area of need, where simple and practical steps like awareness and access to a counselor could literally save lives - or just allow a young life to blossom fully. There won't be flashy headlines about curing cancer for the umpteenth time in mice, so it doesn't call out to the usual big donors.

Hmm, good to note. Although, they are engrained within the US government so I doubt they will ever truly fail. Just throw them a few classified DHS contracts whenever they want.

Here's a hint:

Hey, I just posted a comment here suggesting mental health organizations before I saw your comment. Awesome project you have going! Right on!

Lol, upvoted. How many people here have actually watched a Korean drama. *raises hand*

Just the first public ones. Frankly, if I were a Bitcoin billionaire (I AM NOT!) I wouldn't tell anyone.

Other than keeping quiet, I was wondering what is good operational security. For the paranoid or high-risk, having a "throwaway" wallet around sounds like good practice.

I know, they sound evil/silly. That Facebook movie really gave me a bad impression of them, but I've been reevaluating recently.

Coinomi is useful for swing trading. As long as you do low volume on long timeframes, without the need to go into fiat, the ability to trade so many pairs without signing up at an exchange is priceless. The lack of open-source transparency is a bit troubling, though.

Coinbase and GDAX are the same company, although they have different services. Gemini is run by the Winklevii, unlike other fly-by-night operations. You could also try localbitcoins, although check for any current issues.
