Okay, i took a quick look at this site. It makes Bitcoin accessible, but does it make for safe storage for large amounts? I wouldn't store my money in my FB account!

Interesting. Thank you for your reply, looking forward to 1.0.

I disagree that this is too abstract. You are perfectly right, that this problem has many many solutions. But the problems is quite concrete: 
How can someone easily setup a safe place to store Bitcoins? 
Answer: ?
The corresponding question with fiat currency is: 
How can someone easily setup a safe place to store US Dollars?
Answer: Go into a bank, hand over your government issued ID, ask an employee to setup an account. Now you can have everybody safely transfer money to your account, with the details the bank has provided you. Your money are very safe and protected.

Yes I am.
I see your point. But at least, even if you don't know how to do all these things (ATM's, PIN's etc, statements your list essentially), you cannot lose your entire savings. You are so to say protected by the banks. In Denmark, if your online bank is hacked, and you didn't do anything extremely stupid (like putting your account details on public display), you will get almost all your money back.
This is not the case with bitcoin, as we've witnessed some times now.

EDIT: If you are here for the serious discussion, please don't read this.
Dumb blonde jokes are common in Denmark. This post is a reference to that. Here are three for you to enjoy:
How many blondes does it take to set a light bulb in place?
Answer: 100
1 to hold the bulb and 99 to turn the house.
Why do so many blondes fall of the table where they have their computer? 
They are trying to surf the internet.
And a last one (not for the sensitive readers, please if you are sensitive, do not read any further):
What is the difference between a plate and an blonde?
You can only bang the plate once.

No offense to dumb blondes, and yes i know they do have savings. 
It was bad sarcasm.
