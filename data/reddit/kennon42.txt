No TAXES due to the US but you have to fill out all of the paperwork for BOTH countries including extra complicated forms for the foreign tax credit (just pray that you are in the foreign country enough days in the year so that you don't have to figure out how to split your income sources)
Living in a foreign country definitely won't remove the already complicated compliance issues with BTC.

...except that the USA taxes all US citizens, regardless of where they live (and even if they pay already taxes in their country of residence). The US and Eritrea are the only countries in the world who do this, every other country just taxes its residents.

Yep, it's a valid option, however that would make it more difficult to visit family, etc - especially if an extended stay were required.

You get a ~$90k Foreign Income Exclusion, so you aren't double taxed on that. Above that if you paid more in foreign taxes you can get the Foreign Tax Credit to offset US taxes. 
But in both cases you have double the paperwork, not to mention the extra foreign bank account reporting (FATCA).

Everyone not wanting him to go is basically trusting in "security via obscurity" - the primary strength of bitcoin is that the currency itself is completely open source and transparent. There is no "secret cabal" or anything like that - Gavin will just be saving a few analysts a couple hours reading through the bitcoin website or listening to a podcast.
Even if they were somehow able to "compromise" him, they couldn't do anything different to the currency than otherwise. 
I say it's a great chance for Gavin to make some money getting to talk about what he loves anyway.
So we US taxpayers are basically just subsidizing Gavin's trip to Maryland :-)
