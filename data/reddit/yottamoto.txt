Oh, and it's real good that you can master decimals.

I.. I don't know where to start. You're including the *sun* into your system. And you want to *add* CO2 into the system. 
The system we're observing is the atmosphere. And the energy level is not self-sustaining, energy is radiated onto it from above by the sun, and to a lesser extent, warming from the earth's surface.
Energy is also reflected back to space (caused by the albedo), or radiated back.
If you include the sun into the system, the total energy change = 0, because the energy trapped in the atmosphere was radiated by the sun. Understand? It's just math. 
I know what you're getting at. But please rethink you use of words.

I know you want to feel right, and you are! I got 100 bits from ProbablyLying, even two times!
And what you don't know: I have a bitcoin address that just received 0.001 bitcoin from said "spam" in the OP.
@_date: 2014-05-19 15:27:44
I got 0.001 bitcoin, yaay! 
@_date: 2014-05-14 11:39:23
I thought that was a joke along the line of "Little Cashing" or "Ka-ching", but I know now that is real.

Didn't know people can get so happy about lawnmowers, but hey, cool for you!
@_date: 2014-01-08 16:30:07
So you mean that the missing 70TH is just casual miners that all just put their Block Erupters away and forget them?
@_date: 2014-05-19 15:54:58
hey, what's up [Im-Probably-Lying]( Feeling generous today?

I regularly run the half marathon distance and my 2c is:
Don't listen to music at all! It forces a rhythm onto you. It is **very** important that you find a steady pace that you feel good with and can keep for a while.
I recommend zoning out and meditating, mentally scanning your body in intervals to check if everything's OK and if your pace is too fast or too slow.
Apart from music: TRAIN! Get your sleep, load up on carbs the night before, eat lightly before the run. Don't get hyped and overpace. And finally, keep yourself hydrated and your blood sugar at a good level.
Good Luck!

I had an address which received a satoshi, from that spamming. But those transaction were invalid and quickly disappeared.
@_date: 2014-01-16 15:19:27
What do you mean by self-sustaining? 
Atmosperic warming is when excess energy is trapped in the atmosphere - energy radiated by the sun.

Subsaharan Africa (and recently, north Africa as well) is being kept in a state of permachaos. Simple divide &amp; conquer strategy. The warlords receive money, guns and drugs. For that, they enable easy access to timber / ores / diamonds / fishing areas / oil. 
All of these armies fighting each other are primarily financial operations.
African instability only started after independence spread. It was just another, darker and subtler way for the former colonists to continue their agenda.

This is also applicable to cash, so I can't really understand the argument.
If it's valuable, it's your responsibility to take care of it. Because *you value it*. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 12:38:12
I guess then I'd also have a hard time getting your wallet passphrase off of you. I'm only 84kg and carry a worthless Playstation Vita.
@_date: 2015-02-13 15:15:35
You can forget you wallet.
Your ID can be stolen. Your credit card can get skimmed. Your bank can default (theoretically). Your web banking account can be hacked.
Just like with bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-14 23:42:15
I suggest you read up on the Cyprus finance crisis of 2012. 6,7% of deposits were seized to finance bank bailouts. No invasors, just bankings investors making a bad gamble and socializing their losses. Would you be happy to pay for their losses out of your pocket?
Europe has been quietly preparing legislation in all countries to pave the way for the cypriot model in other countries. 
And why should bitcoin be worthless if your country's currency tanks? Worthless in comparision to what? Your local currency may be worthless, but bitcoin is traded internationally and will retain value.
@_date: 2015-10-16 11:36:18
Why not take Stackexchange and integrate Bitcoin into that?
@_date: 2015-02-13 15:52:55
And what will these new friends tell me?
@_date: 2015-02-13 12:42:41
Not heard, just [read](

In both cases the value of the money you've got in your bank account is decreased, which is theft by other means.
What I'm trying to get at is that *nothing* is 100% secure. Accumulating valuables will always carry risk. It's *by definition* - otherwise it wouldn't be valuable, would it? And arguing semantics is besides the point.
@_date: 2015-02-13 16:05:20
Look a [this list of sovereign defaults](
It's not as uncommon as you might think. And the way things are going in Europe, that list will need to be updated soon.

Well, the 200€ I recently got stolen from me didn't suddenly reappear on my account after I filed a report with the police. The $180 my brother-in-law lost because his CC number got skimmed are also gone. Remember the banking crisis in Cyprus?
Like with Bitcoin, it may be reversible in *theory*, but not in practice.
@_date: 2015-02-26 11:12:09
Back when the paltry amount of coins I mined was worthless, I played satoshidice for a few days. I regret doing that *so very, very* much!
@_date: 2015-02-13 10:59:32
and your arguments address the *usability* of bitcoin, which is completely independent of trust in a centralized authorities. 
We are not talking about usability and accessability here.
@_date: 2013-08-02 13:20:32
Thanks, thanks, I humbly accept. *bows and leaves soap box*

You're so right. Everytime I want to get one, I check the Bitcoin calculator. Profitable in a year, earliest? Why not just buy the coins?

This is the translated [blurb]( for the video:












So, now all the little kiddies are in the know!

But it's pretty much the text of the blurb I liked to in my comment.

I wanted to file a Paypal dispute, but I was over the 45 days.
I filed a dispute for the 2Ghs extra for the Jally I ordered, but just got the boilerplate text from them. Way to run a company.

* Hundreds of Bitcoin miners buy changers which each turn the bulb only 0.0001°.
* More and more miners chip in, but the bulb is screwed in tighter every day and needs even more power to turn.
* Depending on their luck, a single miner can change a bulb once every 5 years.
@_date: 2013-08-12 08:30:11
Damn ASIC miners.

1) If Bitcoin does not catch on in 3-5 years it will devalue. Currently everyone is investing and trading Bitcoin, but very little is paid and bought with it.
Another big risk I see is that Big Banking does a 51% attack as soon as Bitcoin is a serious threat.
2) There will be changes to make it easier to use for businesses, payment terminals, etc. Clients that will not have to download the whole blockchain. Improved anonymity.

I should add that the show is aired on a state-owned channel.

As if. I've been waiting since 9th of May. They make me angry.

Chill. He's sunk a few hundred dollars into BFL and is uneasy about it. Quite understandable.
And Janus321 just pretty much rephased the post.
@_date: 2013-06-05 12:38:38
Why shouldn't they go and break BTC?
@_date: 2013-09-18 08:46:18


Thinking of BFL perchance?
