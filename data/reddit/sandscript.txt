Genuinely curious. How does one word a ban on crypto that doesn't also ban 1. secure online banking with fiat currency, 2. any kind of private currency like Amazon Coins or frequent flyer miles?

That's just an exchange rate. You could do the same thing with Euros, but they make sense on their own. Their economy is just more entrenched than Bitcoin's.

Despite the pain in my chest, I still wish you the best.

I was thinking about this exact thing yesterday. I went to overstock.com to see about using Bitcoin as a payment method. It looks like they set everything in dollars price wise and you just pay the market exchange rate in btc when the transaction goes through. 
So technically, the btc price of all their items fluctuates wildly, but it doesn't matter because everyone is using dollars to think about the prices. 
I think that's it.

Actually I think they work very well as a way to accrue unsolicited criticism.

Okay well if we're doing this I have to offer a rebuttal: [

That's my plan. Hopefully this December will see some rises and I'll do some Christmas shopping on Newegg or Overstock.

I've got coinbase sending me push notifications about the changes like crazy. And by the time the notification comes in, it's already spiked in the other direction!

Assange built up credibility by championing transparency in government. Then he spent it all to help Russia fuck with democracy.
@_date: 2019-04-12 10:54:47
Personally I think he may have been compromised by the GRU and turned into an unwilling asset.

HathC code example:
     &lt;stdio.h&gt;
    
    //behold the function chiefest of its kind
    int cardinal()
    {
        //the following doth yield the quoted words
        scrivenf("Hail, world, well met!");
        //and here the programme endeth without fray
        relinquish 0;

I fully agree, but with only one tweak we'd be back on firm ground: past performance is no *guarantee* of future results.

That was great all the way through, but I truly laughed out loud when the lambo flew across.

Goddam gdax. I wanted to buy the dip at 6.2k but my funds won't be available till the 13th!

I wanted to buy at 6.2k but my transfer didn't go through for a week. Ended up getting in at 8 something. Still exciting though.

I think it's an artificially slow process to incentivize you to use coinbase, which takes a percentage. Last time I used coinbase it went through immediately.

The idea is.. you buy Bitcoin with your native currency, then you can buy things digitally with Bitcoin.
