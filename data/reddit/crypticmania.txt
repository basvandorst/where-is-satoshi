Would be curious if there is any validity to their analysis. 
From the article:
*From all the data established above, what we see is the following:* **When economic agents in the Bitfinex market start to trade and purchase Bitcoin on the aggregate, this encourages economic agents in other exchanges in the other two relevant markets to begin increasing their trade volume but does the exact opposite. The question is, why is it that Bitfinex increase offsets the other two exchanges decreases? The answer to the Bitfinex miracle may be down to fraud involving Tether.**

**END THE BACKLOG** is an initiative of the Joyful Heart Foundation to shine a light on—and eliminate—the backlog of hundreds of thousands of untested rape kits in the United States.
** This may be a worthy cause to help catch serial rapists all over the US.
check out this post gaining a lot of momentum atm for context: *11,341 abandoned rape kits identify 817 serial rapists in one Michigan county* (

but you have to admit things smell fishy. people want answers, even if some of the methodology is unorthodox or a bit of a reach. this is bound to happen until we get some real answers unfortunately. who knows what's really going on...

that logo does have a striking resemblance to the bitcoin logo...what does the B actually stand for?

I'm curious to find out how they managed to target you specifically. Can't be a coincidence the coins were stolen the night you transferred them...sounds like an inside job...or someone knew about your transaction from another source maybe? Sorry man, hope you recover the coins - let u know if you have any updates.

this is probably true, however, the real issue becomes figuring out your capital gains tax once you decide you want to pull out your fortune...I don't think the reality of that issue has really settled in with the community. What are the tax implications? An accountant specializing in cryptocurrencies will be in high demand thats for sure.

it's one thing not knowing about bitcoin a few years back, but knowing about it, being advised to invest in it repeatedly by friends, finally doing so, your investment is lost and taking a few years to workup the courage to get back into it...it's the classic bitcoin tale that we all suffered

but I prefer to imagine the drink full of liquified bitcoin

Crash or burn, we're sticking with BTC all the way to the end.

we're all just helpless masochists here aren't we?

you should just pretend like you did it on purpose and hope it catches on...probably not, but crazier things have happened...

what is this "charge back" wizardry you speak of...this is light years ahead of anything I've heard on these forums

Didn't tether get their books audited? did they also share their *summarized* audit results? Many mention that no one has seen Tether's audit tho am I right? how is this Bitfinex announcement any different? What do *summarized* results even mean? will it be better than a simple "trust us bro, we're solvent" can we see the audit summary? "werent you listening? we just *summarized* it for you" But seriously, do they have any obligation to share the true results with us if the results turn out to be unfavorable or they just don't feel like it? Can they lie about the results of an audit? Also can we get some sort of confirmation from Friedmann LLC that they are in fact auditing Bitfinex? Just wanna make sure it's not another disappointing *engagement* ;)

why aren't there any updates regarding the hack? did they just give up? how can they talk about regaining customer's trust when they keep on skirting any details regarding the hack...making customers "whole" (questionable if you can call it that) is not enough, how'd 120k btc just disappear with no trace on your watch...how did this happen?!? Not even like an update on the supposed on-going investigation...just pretend like it never happened and hope no one notices. Is it just me or does it seem wildly convenient that those same customers bitfinex made whole can't get their BFXUSD out of their exchange because of "BANKING" issues. But just take their word for it guys...they're solvent and good, decent dudes...just be patient...you know, they're only handling like 100s of millions dollars worth of people's crypto with the business infrastructure of a frat house, nothing to worry about. phew...enough ranting for a day - hope they prove themselves but wish more reputable exchanges would open up shop in the unregulated space...
