Thank you very much! Managed to get access using Multibit. Going to send everything over to a bip44 wallet now since it seems to be in much wider use.

I'm pretty sure OP is one of those people, considering the username and all.

When I tried my passphrase in Mycelium, it seemed to create a new wallet with a 0 balance :/

I'm inclined to agree. Brexit is what got me into Bitcoin. The £ is worth 19% less since then, so I'm glad I did! It's likely to drop again today.

Have a look at Copay on Android. Absolutely free.

I don't believe so no. Breadwallet just gives you a 12 word phrase, and a 4 digit PIN, but I'm pretty sure the 4 digit PIN is local only?

Pretty sure it's like a 'L' plate. "Go easy on them they're new."

If they're on the exchange, they're easy to sell. If they're in your wallet, you gotta transfer them, then sell. More effort means less selling.

The most secure method is a paper wallet, because there's only one copy, and no one can interfere with it.
I guess... a wallet app dev could do a stealth update that sends all of your bitcoins to them, but it's pretty unlikely.

For all you know, this guy pays his bills, buys, his food, has his savings, all accounted for and his "extra money" comes from his paycheck. Don't be so quick to tell other people how to spend their money.

Jokes stop being funny when someone goes all SJW.

If I spent one set of the coins after the fork, would it also spend the other set?
It almost seems like printing money? I still haven't quite got my head around the whole fork thing.

I mean, if you go on holiday, especially on a package deal, you would usually have the option of calling your holiday operator and paying in your local currency. They then pay the tour operator in whatever their local currency is, so I reckon this would still work with the spirit of the competition.
