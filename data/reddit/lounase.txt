Is paper and pencil cold storage the "safest" from hackers.  I understand the paper needs to stay safe.

It's amazing comparing these futures exchanges to a casino or bookies "spread."
They set the price based on public perception's 50/50.
Superbowl - Philly vs New England...they say New England -4 points.  Meaning if you bet New England, they have to win by 4 points, and Philly can win or lose by 4 points and you still win a Philly bet.
Most people don't have the resources to handicap professional sports...I think most handicappers focus on horse racing.
Again, its numbers set for public perception to get it to 50/50 buy/sell.  If you know something Vegas (or the exchanges don't) then you can capitalize.
I had a friend playing for an under-performing big name college in the 2000s.  The head coach was leaving at the end of the year, and they would not make a bowl game.  My buddy said his team was in shambles the last few weeks.  Both coaches and players skipped practice, no game prep for the last 2 games of the year.  Most of the public wasn't aware of this.  If Vegas was, then it didn't matter...they still set the spread to 50-50, sometimes leaning the opposite way to push more public money 1 way.
I bet $1000 against my friends team the first game, easy money.  Then doubled down on the biggest single bet of my life with $2500...won it easy.  This is probably more closer to insider trading...but lines between handicapping and insider trading are blurred...since there is no insider trading in sports betting.
Does "handicapping" exist in futures like it does in sports?

I'm going to tread lightly as I'm not sure myself 100%.  ETF is an exchange traded fund.  You buy and sell shares of the ETF.  They mimic the real asset.
They form this ETF, buy 10,000 bitcoins.  Then sell shares of the ETF.  In theory, the price per share should mimic bitcoin price on a day to day basis.  But its all based on the bitcoin:shares ratio.  Maybe its 1:1, maybe its 100 shares to 1 bitcoin.  Regardless they should move together.
This allows people to buy and sell ETFs without actually trading in bitcoin.  The funds bitcoins never move, just the shares people buy and sell.
Basically it will be like a stock price for bitcoin.  People with regular stock accounts could "own" bitcoin in a round-about way.  However, shareholders never actually own the assets.  
*Shareholders do not directly own or have any direct claim to the underlying investments in the fund; rather they indirectly own these assets.*
I can't begin to say whether this is good or bad for bitcoin.

any recommendations on a hardware wallet?
Also any hardware wallets for alt coins?  I have a dozen holdings in alt coins that I worry about.
