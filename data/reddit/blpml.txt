Disagree. It is a *Peer-*to-*peer* currency. Meaning that there must be two *peers;* you and the other person. And in such a scenario an exchange can only happen if there is a consensus on what is being exchanged. If you consider Bitcoin an exchange of value but I do not I won't accept you Bitcoins and thus won't sell or buy anything to/from you.

No, I do not want a comparison. I want to know "If that is the case, is there any chance it will ever be adopted?" And by *that* I mean "There is still no clear consensus on what Bitcoin is (some see it as store of value, others as value of exchange…).".

nah. Just look around you when shopping, there are SO many things people see (that are far more interesting looking than an orange box) and people still ignore it.

Probably all, but this doesn't matter here as it does not answer the question at hand. It is money, that is enough for two people to use it.

Disagree. There is a consensus insofar as people know that it is no exchange of value or unit of measure, but a store of value, i. e. people know that they cannot use if for paying. This lacks with bitcoin.

Yeah, but if that is true for everybody how can it then ever become a *currency* of the world/internet… if each member of this world/internet has a different opinion on Bitcoin?

As mentioned above, I think this is a very problematic misconception:

Regarding 10: a solution to what? You lost no problems in the points 1-9.

Which problems do you see in Cuba that Bitcoin could solve? Serious question as there are many issues Bitcoin can (not) solve there.
As an inspiration you could check out what MasterCard is doing in that area ([ &amp; [
Also take into consideration that people &amp; organizations w/ significant more influence than you are active in some areas you seem to be addressing (I am assuming, for instance, financial inclusion) but haven't found a solution yet. This indicates that the technology might already by here, but not available to Cuban. This leads to the question: Why is it not available to them?

Frankly, his thoughts on the future of blockchain  is little proof that it's a great technology as he has little to no technical background.

Sorry, not getting your point.
@_date: 2018-10-23 11:07:01
you post makes zero sense and you know it.

Agree, but I disagree with:


Sure you need. If somebody does not how X works she cannot appreciate the potential of Y (where Y is the new technology).
If I do not know how, for instance,  monetary policies work I also do not know what's wrong with them or how they could be fixed. Also, if I do not know how Cryptocurrencies work I do not know how they could fix fiat money.
The same goes for traditional databases and blockchains as a distributed ledger, privacy policies of totalitarian governments (or monopolistic internet companies) and privacy coins etc.

hm, ok that sounds fair.

EDIT: I am the arrogant one.

You know that people are desperate when you see a post with *zero* arguments (just a bunch of "I believe" and guesses") gets that many upvotes.
