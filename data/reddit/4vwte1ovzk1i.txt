I understand trading mechanisms, but if you have something with intrinsic value, market price doesn't matter, nor does the number of buyers/sellers as it's value is constant. Bitcoin's value is speculative and so it does matter whether there are buyers/sellers.

If an apple was priced at $1000, you'd buy it because 1 Apple = 1 Apple? Obviously not so stop being bloody stupid for the sake of it.
The price of an asset is an exchange rate. Do you think the value of a Bitcoin is equal to the value of $11400? Is it worth more dollars? Is it worth less? Forget what other people think, use common bloody sense because eventually it's price will return to it's real value.
That said if you want to trade volatility, this is a good time to buy, but if you're just going to HODL forever, it isn't.

Lightning's biggest flaw is that either party can remove all funds from a shared wallet. Elizabeth Stark (the main Lightning dev) admits this when she said ["I get all of her funds too as a penalty"]( All you have to do to steal the coins is not sign a previously agreed upon transaction and then broadcast this on-chain calling the claim fraudulent (even if it was legitimate) and you'll be awarded all the coins.
As for an exaggerated benefit, it doesn't currently fix scaling issues. If we want the world to adopt lightning it's going to take 40+ years just for everyone to have a single channel opened on the blockchain. That means we need channel factories (another layer) but that means another 2+ years of development. 
Another down side is that lightning may not even happen, [according to Elizabeth Stark]( (Lightning's main developer) lightning will be released on 14th June 2016 at the latest. Did that happen? All their promises that it'll be soon fall flat so I've personally lost hope.
Thanks for asking me though, sort of fed up of just being accused of FUD without the person being willing to hear what I have to say.

A value placed on anything without intrinsic value is a bubble because eventually circumstances change, economies change, currencies change and at the end of it no one wants your actually worthless asset anymore.

No reason to not trust people? You don't understand Bitcoin then, the whole basis is that it's trustless and there's no counter-party risk. 
Even if tether is legit it's still terrible for anything but keeping the price of Bitcoin high and sets a bad precedent for the future.

It doesn't matter if it does or doesn't fall further, but I'm not interested in buying back in a purely speculative investment until it does. If it doesn't, oh well, it could have as easily fallen as risen and then I'd be in the red if I bought now.

I love the tech and I think it has potential but that potential has not been reached and the current price cannot be justified. I can't see it's real value being more than $200. Given that, I don't want people to lose their money for the chance, the less than 50% chance, of getting rich quick. Better advice would be to invest in stable assets with a long history of stable price increases.
I want Bitcoin to succeed, but as a technology not as a speculative investment.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:08:20


This is a big fallacy. If Bitcoin dropped to $0.01, would you have not netted anything because you "haven't sold"?
By not selling when it hit $19k, you've still lost money because you could have that money, but you don't. Through inaction you've still lost money even though it doesn't seem like it because of when you bought.
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:31:43
I reckon it'll drop if it ever hits $12.2k. In 2013/2014 after it's drop following the high, it retraced 84.7% of it's value (we saw that in the last couple weeks when it hit $17k again) before falling. The next high in 2014 was at 61.2% of the ATH, for the current ATH that high will be just below $12.2k.
Edit: Just as a prediction, final low will hover around $4.4k with the lowest being at around $2.7k, that is if history repeats itself.
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:25:02
If that happens, the blocksize is still going to need to increase, the lightning network Whitepaper says as such, else the cost of opening and cashing out a payment channel is going to be extraordinarily high.
But a blockchain increase would ruin decentralization. Either way, Bitcoin as a decentralized currency cannot scale.

Pretty much. A new altcoin doesn't have a user-base so as a developer you make up 100% of the vote. As such new altcoins can do whatever they like whilst updates to Bitcoin, such as SegWit which is without doubt a great update, fail to be adopted.

I'm not clairvoyant, I can look at a graph and identify growth as being unsustainable. It comes down to "If making money is this easy, why isn't everyone doing it?" Eventually everyone that will invest has invested and from there it can only go down. It's basic economics, not intelligence or clairvoyance. 
On the other hand not selling when you saw the price rise from $11.6k to $16.6k in the space of 5 days is being a dumbass, of course that growth isn't going to continue. You were even given a second chance less than two weeks ago but nooooo, your dead set on it reaching $30k even though there is absolutely no reason it will go this high and many reasons why it wont.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:27:42
No, there are not cheaper conductors which are as effective. It's only beaten in conductivity by silver and copper however both tarnish making them useless for passing low voltages. Gold's non-reactive nature means it doesn't tarnish so is suitable for use as a conductor. In practice, it is the best conductor for components of a computer and is essential for modern CPU's. **Essential**. Good luck mining or hodling your Bitcoin without a CPU.
Even still, gold can't fall far before CPU manufacturers buy in. That's a very comforting fact, one Bitcoin does not have.

2 days ago people were saying it'd never drop below $13k again ([proof]( Then people said there was no reason to worry if it dropped below $13k because it wouldn't drop below $10k ([proof]( It's since dropped below $10k.
With a speculative asset like Bitcoin, there's no reason it won't drop below $7k in line with the current trend.

Surely it's populism personified. You need to rally people to get any update passed. 
Take Lightning, it's benefits are exaggerated, it's issues overlooked and the public support for it near unanimous because it helps everyone overcome the common struggle that is scalability.

Naive. It's purchasing power changes and so it's value changes. If you think otherwise you're some sort of extremist who doesn't possess common sense.
If Bitcoin fell to $0.01, and stayed there for a long-period of time, would you genuinely think that everything else rose in value and that's why it cost more? Or would you accept that it was Bitcoin which fell in value? 
Bitcoin isn't some sort of universal unit for measure and storage of wealth, and you shouldn't treat it as such.

It's a bubble, it's always been a bubble. The shared delusion may last 200 years, it may last 200 seconds. It's always been dangerous to buy as the 'real' value of the asset hasn't been seen since 2013, and at any time it could return to that price.

If 7,600,000,000 people are opening and closing channels on the chain with a 1MB block size, the gas will be cheaper than the channel closing fee. In fact, it'll take years for someone to even open a channel even when paying exorbitant fees because the block size is not large enough to process even 7,600,000,000 tranactions in 40 years, so how is everyone going to be opening and closing these channels?

People 'vote' by updating their software however this can cause them to be cut off from the rest of the community until everyone else updates, and if everyone else doesn't update then they have to downgrade again. This means that you need to actively embolden 50% of people to vote but also to believe that 50% adoption will occur, else they won't be bothered to upgrade as they'll believe they'll have to go to the effort of downgrading again later.
If you're a large holder of Bitcoin, why should it be you who forks out the $ to update the software? Especially since the chance of the update being adopted is very low. You're likely throwing money away. Those who are willing to pay for the update to increase their wealth don't feel it's fair that it's just them paying the money, they want everyone to contribute (like a tax) and so instead of updating Bitcoin they create an altcoin/fork (like Bitcoin Cash) with the update instead as they can earn more money that way.

I'm not saying it won't go up, I'm not saying you should panic, I'm just pointing out how stupid it is comparing the current price to past prices. The question should be "Is Bitcoin worth it's current price?", if yes, HODL, if no, sell.

Why would the world purchase a worthless asset? Bitcoin was attractive (from a practical standpoint) because it was 'fast' and had 'low processing fees'. Both are no longer true. It's not suitable for the type of widespread use people keep on talking about.
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:14:04
In the long term, yes, but so will Bitcoin. For anything to be future proof it needs to have an intrinsic value, that's something Bitcoin doesn't have. Any benefits of Bitcoin can be applied to countless altcoins meaning Bitcoin's dominance isn't practical, it's sentimental.
Also, investors don't care about the long-term and they definitely don't care about prices after they die. The dollar isn't likely to fail in an investors lifetime so they don't see it as a risk. Plus those dollars don't hang around long, they'll be invested in an asset or a business.

An often overlooked reason is that 50% of gold goes in jewellery and 10% industry, that means 60% isn't speculative and so if the price drops too low, jewellery/electronics companies capitalize and the price goes back up. It can't fall that low... ever.

On-chain use exists but there are still many problems, not least that either party can remove all funds from a shared wallet. Elizabeth Stark (the main Lightning dev) admits this when she said ["I get all of her funds too as a penalty"]( All you have to do to steal the coins is not sign a previously agreed upon transaction and then broadcast this on-chain calling the claim fraudulent (even if it was legitimate) and you'll be awarded all the coins.

Thought process was 87,000 people invest $37,000 each into 16,800,000 coins. Thats $3,219,000,000 spread across 16,800,000 coins, $191.61 dollars each.
With Bitcoin's scaling problems I can't see it being practically used by more than this many people and I've even given the courtesy of assuming they invest everything in Bitcoin. As such, I see $200 as a maximum actual value of the coin at this stage in development.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:52:44
I'm fully aware of this, but if we're thinking long term all assets are worth their intrinsic value. 
A barrel of oil is always going to be worth the useful items which can be produced by a machine powered by burning that oil. Bitcoin will eventually be worth nothing, it has no use which can't be replicated (by any other altcoin). So those saying that they'll always HODL are doomed to fail.

Why would companies go through the effort of SegWit without existing widespread SegWit adoption? It doesn't save them money (as it's users who end up paying the transaction fee), in fact it'll likely cost them to update their infrastructure.
Conversely until companies switch to SegWit, widespread adoption won't occur.
TLDR; It's a Catch-22 so it's never gonna happen.

As for Bitcoin in general, 52.9% of the hashrate is produced by BTC.com, AntPool and BTC.TOP so you only need to pay off 3 people to perform a 51% attack. People assume you need to persuade millions of people but you really don't, less than a million wallets exist and 3 of them control over 50% of the blockchain. 
Don't forget the 100+ wallets with 10,000+ coins ($100,000,000+), they could all individually crash the market overnight.

The need for ongoing development is perhaps Bitcoin's greatest flaw. You buy a gold coin and you're sorted, but buy Bitcoin and you need to look out for bugs in Bitcoin or your wallet software, quantum cryptanalysis attacks against the blockchain, potential forks which make Bitcoin obsolete, storage solutions which don't degrade with time, how useful Bitcoin can possibly be and whether the current price is above/below that etc. etc. etc.

Even assuming that's true, which I don't think it is, we're already seeing the same scenario. Blockstream's nicked everyone's money, cex.io is "misplacing" large deposits. Other exchanges are doing the same.
Additionally this time, Tether is potentially functioning on a fractional reserve basis which'd crash crypto if too many people tried to swap for dollars, and the same can be said for exchanges, who sell more coins than they have because they assume not everyone will remove them from the exchange's wallets.
I reckon we'll see another Mt. Gox level event, and even if we don't, confidence has shaken and we're on the way down, it may just take a little longer than before.

Yes I accurately predicted the future, and I was able to do so because:


Humans are predictable. The field of psychology is dedicated to predicting human behavior. Because Bitcoin's price is purely speculation, there are times when it is easy to identify what is about to happen. Today isn't one of those days, the rise from $11.6k to $16.6k was.

It's desirability. It's the only colored element that doesn't react with skin, is solid at room temperature and is scarce enough to become desirable. It can be worn as jewelery (hence 50% of gold goes straight into jewelery) and is used in every CPU (yes, you've inadvertently invested in gold). Atop this is a 6000 year history of stable prices and guaranteed returns. The price can't drop because Jewelery and CPU manufacturers would buy in to make use of the metal whilst it's cheap, meanwhile Bitcoin and fiat will never be bought to be used because they have no use. Gold is backed by it's usefulness.

No one gets paid to develop Bitcoin so there's very little incentive for developers. To apply an update you also have to persuade at least 50% of the community it's a good idea, that's 1000's of people you have to get on board with your idea.
Because Bitcoin is decentralized, there's no "team Bitcoin" to go to to get funding or to push the update for you, and that makes it extremely hard to get anything done.
It's also not easy to fix the flaws. It's not like your just going to fix them over night, it takes 1000's of hours of unpaid work.

It's a bit like cash, it's private until you take it to the bank (which you have to do eventually). So if you were a government you could fund a weapons deal, wait for the media attention to cool off, and only publicize it at a later date. The deal was still done, it's cryptographically secure, but it's sort of postponed on being added to the blockchain. That way, if you shop somewhere a lot, all of your transactions can be pooled into one large transaction at a later date saving you on transaction fees.

Bitcoin isn't practically useful with these fees, it's just useful for those who want to try and make money.


Hard-coded, but both SegWit and the Lightning Network fix transaction fees somewhat. Whilst it's an unpopular opinion, and I am going to get downvotes, there's no denying that Bitcoin cash, a fork which increased the blocksize from 1mb to 4mb, does have lower transaction fees. That is a fact. Whether it'll prove effective in the long-term is yet to be seen.
@_date: 2018-01-19 06:29:08


It takes 42.4 years for the blockchain to process 7,600,000,000 transactions, so even if everyone were to open a Lightning channel with someone else, it's going to take 42.4 years.

Bitcoin isn't valuable, it's speculative. Anything could happen to the price.
If noone sells, however, that restricts the amount available for trade meaning those who buy will have to pay more for their coins, pushing up the price. Unless you have millions invested, whether you buy or sell really doesnt make a difference.

I knew that noone could justify the price and so people were about to stop buying which would cause the price to fall as the majority of people begin to sell and only a minority are left buying. So you're right, I didn't know how many everyone was or how much money they had, but I did know when the balance of people wanting to sell would cross 50% which, for the purposes of predicting price, is just as good.

Then again, if you flood the precious metals market with silver, why would that effect the price of gold? Infact, it'd increase the price of gold as people sold the silver and bought into gold. Flooding the crypto market with new coins should be strengthening Bitcoin's dominance but it isn't.

So long as no more than the amount of reserves (in my above example 2%) the exchange keeps are ever needed at once, there will be enough coins to solicit transactions.
Even if the transaction goes from Exchange A to Exchange B and so you could say Exchange A has 'lost' one of it's real coins, it is equally likely that a transaction went from Exchange B to Exchange A and so over the course of a week, net movement between exchanges is 0 (or near enough). 
As such exchanges don't need to keep any actual coins other than those needed before the transaction is canceled out by and equal transaction going in the other direction. In reality this canceling of transactions would probably happen every 10 or so minutes (with every block) so it's practically seamless and CoinBust will always have enough actual coins to hand to solicit such transactions.

I think doesn't trust the central bank to make these decisions (like minimum reserves) in the public interest which is why a currency with all decisions hard-coded appeals to them. I think it appeals to a lot of people. Whether it will work is a long-standing debate filled with speculation, disinformation and few hard-facts. 
My take on it is that it will work (once the bubble pops) so long as an alternative currency with inflation (such as the dollar) is still in-use alongside it. The lack of inflation will make it an investment, not currency.

A more thorough guide can be found [here](
 Linux on a flashdrive
1. Install ~~Rufus~~ [Etcher]( on your Windows PC.
1. Download a Linux iso. There are hundreds for you to chose from but if you're new to unix-like operating systems you'll probably feel most at-home with Linux Mint, a download for which can be found [here]( You'll want the 64-bit version (if you're using a recent laptop) but it doesn't matter whether you chose Cinnamon or MATE. If you're unsure, chose Cinnamon. Select the mirror nearest to you and the download will start.
1. Plug in a blank USB flash drive.
1. Open ~~Rufus~~ Etcher. It should select most options by default, the only options you must change are selecting the right flash drive and ISO file.
1. Once Etcher is finished, unmount the flashdrive and turn off the PC. 
1. Turn on your computer (with your flashdrive plugged in) and see what happens. If it boots into Windows normally, see the next step, if not, skip ahead to step 9.
1. You're going to have to enter the BIOS, you achieve this (on most Dell laptops) by turning the computer off, starting it up (again, with the flashdrive plugged in) and then continually spamming f2 until it enters the BIOS. It will look something like [this]( but don't panic, you haven't broken anything.
1. Navigate to boot options. If you see the words UEFI, change it so it says Legacy. The boot order should appear, the harddrive will likely be at the top and the flashdrive somewhere below that. Move the flashdrive to the top.
1. Save and exit the BIOS, turning the computer off and on if necessary.
1. You should now be booting into Linux Mint, wait patiently pressing enter when prompted until you reach a desktop.
1. Plug in a **different** blank flash drive (I'd recommend at least 32GB). This is the flashdrive we'll be installing the permanent version of Linux Mint to.
1. On the desktop, there will be an installation option which says something to the effect of "Install Linux Mint". Click it.
1. A prompt guiding you through installing Linux Mint will appear. It should guide you through the installation process. When you're uncertain keep the default option. It is likely the only options you'll want to change are the username/passwords, encryption settings and importantly the drive you want to install Linux Mint onto. Make sure to select your blank flashdrive. It can be easy to miss this screen if you're clicking through the default options so watch out for it.
1. Once the installation has finished, unplug the first flashdrive, leave the second flashdrive plugged in and restart the computer. Linux should boot. If it doesn't, repeat steps 7 through 9 so that your flashdrive is recognized as the default option.
If you need any help using Linux Mint once it's installed, it's worth reading the [Linux Mint User Guide]( Feel free to ask or pm me any other questions.

Gold isn't valued due to it's scarcity. It's valued due to it's utility which (in conjunction with it's scarcity) causes it to have a high demand. 
Gold is valued because it is one of only two significantly colored metals (the other being copper). Of the two colored metals, gold is the only one that doesn't react with human skin and is the scarcer of the two. Gold is also divisible which is why it is a better financial asset than jewels.
Unlike gold, Bitcoin (and fiat) have no utility which is why their eventual value will be 0 whilst Gold is likely to always retain some value.

Most of the transactions between exchanges cancel, that is over the course of a day the net-movement of Bitcoin from one exchange to the other is close to 0. As such, the exchanges never really need to hold more than a day's volume and their net coins, both real and fake, doesn't change over the course of a day. As such they never need to move the fake bitcoins to the blockchain as the real coins are enough to sanction transactions from day to day.

That means that £50 would convert to 0.00393223 Bitcoin.
You got 0.00310734 so that's a transaction cost of 21.0%
This is a link to that transaction: 
As you can see they transfered Bitcoin to a lot of different people during the transaction so it's hard to pinpoint what fees were paid on your bitcoin specifically. However, the fees paid in total for the whole transaction were 0.01019355 BTC which is 0.49% of the total amount transfered.

We didn't break down the wall, the sellers chickened out and didn't want to sell at a price when they can get higher later.

Would you describe money in a bank account as being in circulation?
Would you describe paying your bills via your bank account as circulating currency?
If yes, then my description of the 'fake' bitcoins as circulating is correct.
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:34:11
I'm not trying to convince you it's correct, I'm saying that it's volume is also increasing (like Bitcoin's) and that at current it has a volume of $5.6 trillion compared with Bitcoin's $0.012 trillion. Bitcoin is 450x smaller.

Public key cryptography was publicized in 1978.
Bitcoin was created in 2009.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:38:04
The factor which separates today's dip from a regular 30%+ dip is Bitcoin's recent media attention. 
Many normal people are now invested in Bitcoin and will be itching to panic sell today which will likely drive the price down. It's hard to say whether the sell-off will be enough to burst the bubble but it wouldn't surprise me if it was.

I'm not confident enough explicitly state '7 days max' but I do agree.

It's as though the exchange creates a private currency for transactions within the exchange which they guarantee is worth exactly 1 bitcoin even though they only have enough bitcoin to back-up a fraction of their private currency.
Edit: So when you buy a Bitcoin from CoinBust you are actually buying a CoinBustBitcoin not a Bitcoin. You just have to hope their guarantee is strong enough for you to cash out the CoinBustBitcoin for an actual Bitcoin.

Even if this is true for the US (and I'm not sure whether it is or isn't), doing this would be as bad.
Printing $100k for every person in the US would introduce $30 Trillion which'd crash the currency.
This figure would likely be lower (due to wealth inequality, it's $100k per person but not all people have $100k to claim) but it'd still crash the currency.

From Wikipedia:
"Fiat money is a currency without intrinsic value established as money by government regulation."
So it isn't fiat as no government can regulate it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:46:55
And, if it does turn out to be a crash, you've cashed out at a high.

It's not redistribution at all. Once the price settles, and if Bitcoin replaces the dollar (which I doubt it will), the old rich will still be able to buy more than the old poor and will still be richer than them.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:22:38
Definitely hold out for a week to see how volatile the price gets after Bitcoin futures and reconsider then. 
I think you did the right thing selling at $16k as the 33% daily rise was the fastest rise ever. In 2013 the price crashed after a 17% rise. The price then looked much like it does now (hopeful that it'd rise again) and it wasn't until 2 months later (when the price crashed to $260) that people began accepting it was a bubble.

The Dow works in approximately 35 year cycles.
There are two prominent interpretations of the Dow at the moment. The first is that we've already had this cycles dip with the 2009 low and so now we will have a normal 15 to 20 year climb to the late 2020's when it'll begin to drop again.
The second interpretation is that we haven't had our dip.  Our last dip only happened 9 years after the previous high (rather than the usual 15 to 20 years) so it's possible that we'd actually see another dip by 2020.
Both are reasonable theories. My point is, more money is flowing into stocks each day than is flowing into crypto. Crypto might be growing, and it might grow further, but it isn't growing large enough or fast enough to rival the existing system.
It may in the future, but it isn't now.

Previous Bitcoin bubble's have plateaued in value for 2 months and then fallen rapidly over the course of a couple weeks. It wouldn't surprise me if we're currently in the stable plateau before the crash as the price is hovering decently below any previously seen peak.

I'm not saying they are, I'm saying they can and I'm saying there's no way to disprove me.
It's something to consider, not something to get mad about.
As for the Bitcoin Cash, so long as less than 2% gets withdrawn no one will ever know, that's why my post references cryptocurrencies rather than Bitcoin specifically though what I say is applicable to Bitcoin.

**Disclaimer: Not financial advice!**
* number of Bitcoin ever purchased = n
* number of Bitcoin left = m
* total spent on Bitcoin = p
* total value of Bitcoin sold = q
* p/n = average buy price
* n-m = number of Bitcoin sold
so your profit is


Multiply this number by 0.2, that's how much you owe in capital gains tax.

Not really. You take the average cost of a pound of sugar which in your case is:


and then divide the price you sold it at by the average buy price:


So in your example a 46.6667% profit was made. A spreadsheet can easily keep track of this. You don't need an accountant.

Only 2% of their coins are insured and they haven't been audited in 3 years (in which time much has changed). Even if CoinBase is legit, they account for a fraction of the market and other exchanges may be practicing the aforementioned practices.

It's not a theory, it's an approximation and isn't some sort of universal fact. Hence I said "approximately 35 year cycles".

Thats BS.
If you sell you believe it'll drop further giving you an opportunity to buy more at a lower price later.

The decoupling of Bitcoin from altcoins suggests that either altcoins are undervalued or Bitcoin is over valued.
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:26:51
Cryptocurrency is important because it provides an unregulated, uncensored, international network for people to exchange wealth and so participate in trade.
As it can't be censored it's a tool for freedom, regardless of where you live, who you are trading with, what tax laws are or whether the item you are trading is itself legal, Bitcoin provides a method for you to transfer wealth without a middleman.
Ontop of this, Bitcoin is finite, only 21 Million 'hard' coins will exist (I say hard because it is likely more than 21 Million coins already exist, see [this]( post), this acts as a tether against inflation meaning that with time a persons wealth increases, rather than decreases in value as the currency deflates.
I understand cryptocurrency fine so why is it that you think I'd take a dollar over crypto? I'm willing to discuss it with you however, like my post says, you'd rather make unfounded assertions such as "you're probably too dumb" and "Cool story brah" rather than have an actual discussion.
