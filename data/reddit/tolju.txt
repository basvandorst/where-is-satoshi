The Crimson Prophet has spoken, all is been revealed. Our time comes.

Actually yeah that's basically how it works and part of the reason why it's not really the best measure of the health of an economy.

Most likely this. If Bitcoin gets really big you can bet your ass all major store chains are going to want their own Lightning nodes, and for them it's easier to hire an external company to set everything up and maintain it than to hire knowledgeable people to do it in house. A lot of companies in IT work this way.

You can't help all of the world's middle/working class. Some will get a bit richer thanks to Bitcoin, a lot won't. For a lot of people it will just be too late to get into. Remember we're talking about hundreds of millions of people around the world.
Bitcoin won't solve systemic problems but it will help if some control gets wrestled from the bankers.

At some point in time the official Samourai wallet webpage was just plain HTTP, not HTTPS, which is kinda weird for a team that considers themselves to be privacy and security freaks. It's been fixed in the meanwhile of course.

It's likely higher but if you assume there won't be more than 100k people connected to a single node (which is a very liberal estimate IMO and will only probably happen to the largest nodes) it's more than enough.

Well I did it anyway. Hope it works out for me!
