Yes, but as people here use to call it Bcash, it's easily forgotten...

You can adapt your lifestyle and start asking small merchants wether or not they are accepting bitcoin when shopping, or if they heard about it. Or explain to people around you complaining about some problems (inflation, banks ban, high fees for financials services they're using) how Bitcoin could help to fix things. Spreading awareness while focussing on fondamentals of bitcoin is the least you can do and does not require any skills, but I'm sure you're already doing so!

Well, it depends on how much they bid on the CPC (cost per click I guess) for the word "blockchain", to check it you would need a adwork account with a funds deposit, but mine hasn't given we can't use bitcoin

Advertisers pay each time you click on their "sponsored links" (in fact they pay for a number of hits), so let's make them spend more than they may earn!

Actually, it's "L'entrepreneur", but as an undefined entrepreneur, you better use "Un entrepreneur" ;)

You're definitely right. This one is less than 10km away from me, I'll totaly visit the place sometime soon!

It's way younger than any big exchange

2 differents transactions take approximatively the same amount of place in a block, wether you send 0,01€ or 100 000 000€. The 1Mb block limit does not limit the number of BTC you can send in a given period of time but the number of transactions (around ~~7 per second~~ *2-3 per second according to Nanobot).
More frequent blocks (of 1Mb) may be a solution, it has been tested for a couple of years by the creator of another currency : Litecoin. You "just" have to decrease difficulty and to lower block rewards, but each block would then be less secure...

Thanks for your enlightment, I hope you'll soon be enrolled in your town's police dep as investigator, you'll be so great!
And then, maybe you can hire me : 1. You stigmatize people on the base of their belief, 2. You make easy shortcuts, and 3. You bash others instead of trying to bring meaningfull discussion. We can compare this to : 1. Racists stigmatize people on the base of their belief, 2. Racists make easy shortcuts, and 3. Racists bash different people instead of trying to bring meaningfull discussion with them.
Guess I'm on something!

If you don't like so many things in Satoshi's blockchain, I guess you are free to leave, instead of trying "to undermine the bitcoin network by misleading the userbase"

The cost of off-chain scaling

It could be a private chain managing your "bitcoin" transactions, but we don't really know yet, do you? If you use side programs / chains to manage your "bitcoin" transactions, there is no way to be sure of anything about thoses. It doesn't even have to be decentralized or opensource. I don't want to trust any developping team in a supposedly trustless environnement.
