I expect roughly alternating upward and downward swings, although not absolutely regular alternating. They would need to rebuy after crashing the price, so it would make sense for them to go long with the options after the crash, then the price to drive or be driven higher during the rebuy.

Interesting but Dash now has InstantSend by default which locks transactions in about a second.

Unless there's something extremely world-changingly unique, then I don't think many people will care about these forks much more.

Skip the Yuan, Bitcoin is becoming THE truly global international currency.  It may not happen immediately but I can see BTC or a particular dominant cryptocurrency like Litecoin or Dash being used as a benchmark for oil and other commodities in the not-so-far future.

I didn't know and I'm surprised, impressed and enthused by this news.

So why not increase the block size now. We've hit a big problem with the high fees and something needs to be done urgently NOW to stop any loss of confidence in Bitcoin as a usable method of payment.

Logarithmic scale is the best way to view Bitcoin and cryptocurrency charts. The same applies to stocks and stock indexes. You can do this for Bitcoin at  .

Title of article is actually "UK Company Acquires ‘Bitcoin’ Trademark..."  
"Wins" sounds like they've won a case but they didn't "win" anything and are unlikely to succeed as trademark law takes into consideration actual usage. Unless they can prove they used the mark "Bitcoin" prior to Satoshi in 2009 (highly unlikely) they're extremely likely to be unable to "win" any case.

Maybe Bentley for Bitcoin, Lambo for Litecoin and Daimler for Dash.

Vertcoin has segwit too.  The Litecoin road map includes working on cross chain atomic swaps between Litecoin and Vertcoin.

If in two minds, do two things - buy half now and the other half at the later date you were considering.

It does depend on how you define money or Money Supply. There's a good infographic at   . It shows how tiny the amount is that Cryptocurrency represents.
@_date: 2019-06-23 22:23:06
Yes, as far as I understand, that would be the closest answer to your original question. The rest of the financial system is a complete colossus though, especially the size of derivatives, which is quite frighteningly huge.

When you buy stuff, ask small businesses if they accept Bitcoin.  Or, more practically currently due to Bitcoin's fees, other cryptocurrencies like Litecoin and Dash for example which are better for general day to day spending.  The more requests retaillers get to be paid in crypto, the more likely they'll be to start accepting it and thus the snowball begins.

Additional decimal places can be added beyond the current 8 to allow for any increase in value.

My logical mind says core will stay as Bitcoin, core having the majority of devs as far as I know. But Segwit2x is the one and only fork that I'm planing to keep just in case it takes over. I think it's unlikely but possible.

Nice. Is the linear regression curve and graph created by a particular piece of software or your own manual calculations and graphing? 
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:38:53
Bitfinex usually shows the transaction fee when you input your withdrawal.  If you go on Bitfinex and follow the normal process of how you would do a BTC withdrawal, it should show you there before you input anything.  I believe the fee is 0.0005 BTC for Bitcoin withdrawals.  About $4.08 currently therefore.

Is the original from   dated 13 December 2014?  Really interesting that the price has continued to just-about follow the curve allowing far a bit of variance - a small uptick and we'll be back on track.

Always look at logarithmic scale when viewing Bitcoin and cryptocurrency charts. Same thing applies to stocks and stock indexes. You can do this for Bitcoin at  . You'll see that the recent increase is nothing special and nothing to get scared about.

Possibly 
Which shows a screenshot at one particular point in time of: 
Seems to be inspired by a twitter post by "Bitfinexed", a well-known anti-Tether/Bitfinex troll
The same page  now shows assets and liabilities now balance with 145.94 Euros actual equity so nothing to be concerned about.
What people fail to realise is that 71 million Euros is tiny compared to BTC daily volume and also tiny when compared to even just Bitfinex volume.
Bitfinex's home page shows a 7 day volume there of $13,286,365,362 so assuming an average 0.15% fee they make about $20 million a week just in fees.
There's probably a good reason for the 71 million euro "shortfall" at one particular point in time but even if it was a true shortfall, Bitfinex could cover it in about 4 weeks of fees anyway.
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:38:36
Well at least it provides a reason for such a large price reduction that happened - it wasn't anything particularly negative about Bitcoin itself, just what was effectively a huge whale selling off.

20 billion Euros per month will be printed from out of nowhere. This is apparently intended to be permanent, month by month by month by.......
Mercifully we have a hard limit on Bitcoin of 21 million BTC as an alternative to the neverending and therefore increasingly worthless paper money.

Trump will also build a great big beautiful wall - not much sign of that yet either. The guy changes his mind on a whim and I wouldn't be surprised if he trolls Bitcoin whilst another member of his family buys cheap now, only for him to have a Bitcoin revelation and extol its praises later.

Even if all that happens to Bitcoin, we still have altcoins to give us hope. Choose a few good coins and diversify for a bright future.

I came to a similar conclusion after trying Nicehash for about a month on various coins. Some profits, some losses but basically I figured it was a waste of time, and my efforts would be better placed in buying or trading.
