I really don't see what all the enthusiasm is about.  While bitcoin increases incrementally, it's market share may very well be below 50% soon.  Block size is a real issue and other competitors are gaining traction, offering essentially what bitcoin can't.

I agree that market cap isn't necessarily everything, but it does correlate to price increases if supply is relatively constant.  Greater market cap can also show dominance, and might lead to snowballing as well, if it is indeed perceived that way.

Segwit or unlimited - what will bitcoin look like in 6 or 7 months?  Other competitors will offer what bitcoin can no longer offer.  Bitcoin always was an experiment.  We'll still have decentralized currency, there will just be other currencies that do it better - and they are rising!

Right, and when we have 7 transactions per second based on our current block size... that's success??  That's a pretty hefty price to pay for brand recognizability!

Don't mean to troll, but in the meantime, a lot of people are turning to other currencies that don't have congestion issues.

The frustrating this is that we don't even seem to be anywhere near a solution - it's deadlock and I think the market is responding.

Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt... I suppose, but isn't it warranted?  Is it possible to have rosy optimism right now.  I think bitcoin moving up is vastly overshadowed by the drastic loss of market share.

There are risks when holding a speculative asset, and the idea of "keep it no matter what" may be just as much a recipe for disaster as fleeing at first sight of trouble. 
I've heard it said that gains in the market come from asymmetries in knowledge (and likely a whole lot of luck).  So I think if anyone feels that Bitcoin has for example been growing at unsustainable rates, or is headed for imminent trouble, then they may be wise to take some money off the table and diversify.  
Believing that you will always be burned by selling bitcoin is another form of panic, and I'd bet as well, a subtle but wilful form of market manipulation from people who have possibly bought into something they aren't quite familiar with, hoping for fantastic gains.
