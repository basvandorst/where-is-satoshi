Oh just some whale trying to buy a Ferrari, since they don't accept btc.

Also have to note today's price. Right now I'm seeing $417.94

Where on earth can I get a lap dance for $.25??
@_date: 2015-01-19 20:01:45
They have a very low buying limit. Starting off its $100/week, and there is not exact time frame for when they increase it.

Isn't the point of bitpay to get around fluctuations though?

isn't there a chance that he has coins in a wallet that nobody knows he owns?
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:49:43
How are we even sure he hasn't sold any of his yet?

500 per day, 15,000 per month for bank transfers. No limit for wire.

Wow it's already worth nothing

Bitcoin could easily be worth 10x what it is now by then, if not, more.
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:53:05
That's not necessarily true.. only true if you send money to a new address each time within the same seed. If you use the same seed same wallet address, it's still only one input, right?
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:11:45
Yes but you get the coins NOW for withdrawing early, instead of next year.
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:46:28
And economics tells us that less supply = ?
I see what you're saying though, it obviously didn't suddenly/magically increase the price.
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:02:24
Well then you shouldn't have left them on the exchange, as you had been warned.
@_date: 2017-08-04 04:09:11
This is hands down the most confusing comment/concept about bitcoin I've ever tried to comprehend. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:26:28
Coinbase doesn't owe you anything.
If you took your BTC out of coinbase, YOU 
now have access to the BCH. That was the whole point of taking them off of coinbase.
Import the private key from the wallet where your BTC was at the time of the fork into a BCH wallet. Move your BTC out of the wallet prior just in case something fucky ends up happening.

They closed my account without a reason or warning, and they're still emailing me like a bunch of assholes.
@_date: 2017-08-04 03:54:20
OP, you don't have 3k now.. keep the drives in anti static bags as another post said, and just hold on to them until you do.
Do NOT throw those drives out. BTC will still be around 10 years from now when your circumstances are different.

Buy back slightly MORE than you use.

A hodler believes that the short term price doesn't matter. It'll go up, down, in circles, whatever. They don't stress about trying to time the highs and lows. Short term markets are chaotic and literally don't make any sense.
They hodl because they believe in the long term fundamentals of the technology and trust that the price in 5 years will be many times the current price.

If you're a full time trader, but have never pulled a single coin out... how exactly do you survive without an income?

This is actually healthy for the market, to add on to what others have said. Prevents it from becoming too... bubbly.

I used viabtc accelerator and was able to get in their 100 free accelerations at the top of the hour. 
That's the site I used to determine the fee.. so I guess max time I could be waiting a while :/

Please don't give them any ideas

Yes, the more spread out bitcoins are between everyone on earth, the less people will have (and it will also be worth a lot more).
If you divided up the 21,000,000 max bitcoins among everyone on earth, it would amount to .003 btc per person. No sense in referring to it in whole bitcoins at that point.
The interesting thing, though, is that the developers/miners can come to an agreement years down the road to allow bitcoin to become even more divisible than it is now. For example, instead of allowing 8 decimal places, like how it is now, we can extend that to 16 decimal places to divide it up among more people.

I wouldn't say private. Id say smart enough to know to hide behind vpns and hide his identity. Satoshi was always straight to business in his posts. 
Plus he potentially has 4.3 bil worth of BTC in a wallet so someone would torture him to get access to the key
