In that case, gold wins?

I mean let's be honest, I love bitcoin and it is a superior modern store of value.
That said, gold has factually been a store of value since nearly the dawn of Civilization. 
Both have a place and purpose.

Weird Trump shade considering the US economy is booming and inflation is roughly the historical average. 
Hate the dude all you want but be honest in your memesmithing

Actually that is a totally garbage analogy.

If fiat were 100% reserved it wouldn't be fiat by definition.
I agree with the rest of your post.

I really hate the "ok Boomer" thing and think it is stupid.
That said.
I am going to make this copy pasta.

This is why the country is so fucked. There are morons like you who actually believe Trump is committing genocide. 
By all means feel free to not like the guy all you want. He is pretty unlikable, but drop the fucking nonsense..... Genocide is a horrific claim that is not even remotely supportable. Even the most post modern bullshit leftist thought process can't get any logical person to that conclusion.

There is no opportunity or discussion whatsoever of placing him on currency. None.
As a result, the only way to interpret the meme is to assume you are projecting the idea that the dollar will be worth markedly less under Trump in 2020.
I pointed out that this projection  is entirely not based in reality.
That leaves two options:
1. You know this and you are dishonest because you hate him.
2. You don't know this and you are an idiot.
So again, hate him all you want just be honest with your meme attempt if you want this community (which is bipartisan) to take you seriously.
