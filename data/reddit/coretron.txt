I find cash app to sell for about $100 a coin above Coinbase's prices.  That said it's often still cheaper, but watch out for this.

I’d say let’s all have a meet up where we hug it out except we’d probably all get held ransom like a meeting of leprechauns for their gold.

Bienvenidos a la Luna! Besides the US and Mexico let’s think about places like Venezuela where an anti inflationary currency like bitcoin could help stabilize the country. At least as much as an r/bitcoin thinker goes.

I've always wondered what the best way to secure the phrase is for the average man. A way that's easy and fool proof for them to retrieve. Keeping a physical copy in any form seems to have as many potential faults of loss or theft. I've got a decent amount of faith that my Google drive isn't comprised and it's an encrypted zip on there. I'm sure I don't follow best practice and in my past research no one really said how to store it. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 09:35:21
Thanks for the tips. I love answers that aren't just telling you what to do but instead help phrase the equation to find the solution for you. The fact that all responsibility falls on you to secure this one thing for all your money is a wonderful conundrum and an excellent conversation to have. So many lessons to learn in this new world. It's why I want my friends to get their feet wet with small amounts. 
One thing is for sure. We're gonna have some really interesting wills on how to retrieve all the parts of the passcode to get our Bitcoin if we die unexpectedly. Someone could make a movie about  this like all those other  bizarre senarios to get an inheritance.

I'm actually a pretty casual bitcoiner and have never dabbled in the paper coin. I'll definitely look into it more and use it to get people into it. 
The more I think of it, The magic act of giving them crypto on paper is a nice intro.

It's the difference between having the bank hold your gold and you keeping it in a safe you control. Coinbase has the keys to your coin. Look up what happened with MtGox. To me an important part of the Bitcoin experience is being completely separate from any institution so it's important I have my wallet. 
I recommend you put a small amount into a wallet to feel it out first. In this thread are some great ideas to secure your recovery phrase. Besides bread, people have suggested DropBit for its ease of use and ability to send to contacts even if they don't have a wallet yet. Another suggested bluewallet.io for it's lightning network support. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 19:49:57
Right. If you're in this to quickly buy and sell to play the market you'd best just keep it in the exchange (coinbase). If you are holding for a period of time or to use the coin for personal use you're better off with a personal wallet. The wallet can only make transactions on the Bitcoin network and cannot directly transact with fiat.

Thanks! Will do along with the other tips here. A gentleman gave me 500 Satoshi on LN as a tip and till now I've just been a distant appreciator of lightning. Just as I introduced my friends, Reddit has helped me jump into something new.

No worries, glad to help. A wallet like BRD can only send or receive Bitcoin from one Bitcoin address to another Bitcoin address. Any time we want to turn USD (or any other currency or crypto coin) into Bitcoin or Bitcoin to USD we need to use an exchange such as coinbase.

Number one reason was they could have to give their real name, ID and face to the app even if just sending the coin to another wallet. Also cash app needs to improve the interface for sending Bitcoin to bring it on par with the ease of a cash transaction. Currently in the UI where you'd normally send your only options are buy and sell. No option to send. To do that you need to go to the menu and "withdraw" it. You select how much to withdraw with a slider bar that doesn't convert to USD which is necessary when sending to another person's wallet. Also wanted to get them to truly own the coin in their own wallet.

Peter Gibbons: Initech.
Joanna: In... yeah, what do you do there?
Peter Gibbons: I sit in a cubicle and I update bank software for the 2000 switch.
Joanna: What's that?
Peter Gibbons: Well see, they wrote all this bank software, and, uh, to save space, they used two digits instead of four. So, like, 98 instead of 1998? Uh, so I go through these thousands of lines of code and, uh... it doesn't really matter. I uh, I don't like my job, and, uh, I don't think I'm gonna go anymore.

True, but this article claim may be worth nothing which means dead in my book. Also, it being worth nothing is an impossibility since at least two people will find some value in it, sparing global nuclear war or some other apocalypse of course.
