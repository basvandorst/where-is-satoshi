You are presuming to know how the next seven years of technological growth are going to materialize. 
Stifling Bitcoin adoption by enforcing an artificial limit won't help development of layer 2 solutions. On the other hand opening the protocol for bigger blocks won't stop layer 2 development, adoption would actually help getting more talent to work within and for the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Layer 2 solutions are going to take fees away from the miners, thus reducing overall network security. A full 1MB block is simply not going to pay the same amount of fees a full 16MB block would.
Limiting the maximum blocksize is effectively a limit to adoption, we needed some years to reliably fill 1MB but now we're here and it's time to adapt and grow. Theres over 100 years until inflation goes to zero (in 2140) so we have no need to limit the blocksize now to force migration to layer 2 solutions (or altcoins). 
What we need to do is push adoption by opening the blockchain to as many people as possible (via low fees and reliable service) so come 2140 we have enough transactions per block to sustain the network. Again, layer 2 is not going to secure the network in any way, and has no right to be considered a scaling solution.

Not alone at all!

Nobody knows exactly how much, but everyone knows it's &gt;1MB
It's not an either-or decision, we can have 2MB/4MB/8MB blocks and still use LN as soon as it's ready. Choking adoption and usage until then makes zero sense and is open sabotage.

How would you know what's "too much at this point in time" ?
Pure speculation, I could pull any random number out of my ass and tell you that's the magic number..

I thought we needed full blocks for this "fee market" thing... we should decrease the blocksize sooner rather than later
