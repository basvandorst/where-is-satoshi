What? They're responsible for ordinary people GAINING thousands of dollars. Don't fight the trend, go with the flow. The market manipulation is obvious, use it to your advantage.
If someone sold it's their own damn fault. The  principle of long or even midterm investment is never sell because of a dip. They're called unrealized losses for a reason.
The hold thing is a meme but it's also legitimately good investment advice
The people who lost money on this shit would have lost it gambling stocks anyway.

He had 20 etherium, a couple of litecoin and some rail blocks. Was over 60k in coins. Even knew the wallet they were transferred to, but I don't see how he could ever find out who took them or get them back.

Similarly, you can start with 99% in crypto ending up being 1-5% of your finances :'(

There was a guy who had crypto stolen straight out of his wallet a couple of days ago and everyone who he asked for help told there was absolutely no way to track the currency
Were they just wrong or...?

Went with Kraken, took me a month and a half to get certified. Made me miss the biggest part of the dip :(

Actually, if Bitcoin became accepted as a currency and people just used Bitcoin to buy things instead of just buying and selling Bitcoin for fiat it would become a lot more stable and it would stop falling/rising like a stock.
The reason it's a zero sum game is it's being sold like a stock, if people hold onto it and spend it like a currency it won't fall at all.

I mean, if someone offered me 30k to lie on the internet I'd do it
Then I'd buy some crypto with it

I'm fascinated by the idea that someone could look at an impenetrable mobile heavy iron canon and think to himself "nah but my horses though".
How is that a comparison you even make? No amount of cavalry would ever be able to even scratch a tank. It's like comparing a gun to a slingshot, house cat to a tiger, a gecko to a Komodo dragon.

I dunno, I still like the people saying it could reach 100k within the year. They've clearly got something interesting going on to get those numbers

I wish I could find such a fast and also trustworthy exchange

I see shit like this all time with stocks too. The second a stock goes down a percent speculatory journalists bust out articles they've been keeping in reserve about how terrible a stock is and how it might drop. The second it goes up a percent they start cheering it on. Bullshit. Never trust any article you read on stocks or cryptos from anyone who isn't a proven investor providing intelligent reasoning without any obvious reasons to shill/attack the stock they re talking about.
Admit to yourself that you know just about nothing when it comes to markets, and then acknowledge that most of these journalists know even less than you.

You can pretty much guarantee a growth in the value of cryptocurrencies as long as they remain popular due to the difficulty going up (meaning the cost of production going up). Miners will never sell at less than the cost of production so the value of things like Bitcoin will naturally rise for the simple reason that they are that much more expensive to create.
Only thing that will kill a cryptocurrency is not being established I.e people not using it and miners not mining it. Something like Bitcoin is more or less too big to fail anymore IMO, so there's really no reason not to think that it will continue its growth over time following its difficulty level.
It's not gambling when the crypto's value is decided over the long term as long as it doesn't die.
