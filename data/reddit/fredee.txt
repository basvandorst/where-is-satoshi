Anything that feels like pricing is not on market is unintentional - we're taking a look. If you buy and you feel it's off market, shoot me a PM and I'll make up whatever the difference is.
Our goal is to be very transparent about fees - the 1% - and not skim elsewhere (like bid offer spread).

TL;DR we want to help people who makes laws and regulations understand how powerful bitcoin is so they don't attempt to regulate away the core value props (open network, decentralized, programmable to future applications, most of which we haven't seen yet).  Can argue about whether or not it's even possible to regulate away, but as few speed bumps as possible is best.

@_date: 2014-09-10 22:47:56
Hopefully soon.  We're excited about this not just because Coinbase is expanding, but because it helps more people access bitcoin in general, which makes the Bitcoin network more valuable to everyone on it.

Good point.  We'll let you know when we roll it out more broadly so this doesn't happen.  Even for the schools we have it up and running for, we're limiting it per day for now (ex: Berkeley has already signed up 50 people today).

Hey!  I answered this question during it.  Not a bad idea.  In some ways not optimal because you're going to be using the underlying payment method 100% of the time, but in some cases this could still end up being cheaper (or, in some cross border scenarios, allow you to make a purchase you otherwise wouldn't be able to make).
@_date: 2014-09-03 20:37:57
Is this because people don't have a good/easy way of getting bitcoin, education on bitcoin is poor, people don't like it for some reason, or people really like USD for some reason?

Fred from Coinbase here - you make a fair point.  The idea is to have it enter the conscious of college campuses (where a lot of innovation and shifts in thinking happen).  So even if the majority of these people don't become avid Bitcoin advocates or users right off the bat, they own some, feel they are a part of it, and are likely to come back to it later.

I thought about correcting.  Doesn't make logical sense now, but it almost seemed so wrong (hundreds of millions of bitcoin) that I felt like it would be hard to correct her without making it very embarrassing for her and derailing the entire thing.  I obviously don't want the general public to think that either :)
Probably was a good way to do it in retrospect.  Downsides of live interviews I suppose.

Potentially stupid question: what does each axis represent?
Thanks for sharing, awesome to see data
@_date: 2016-06-11 02:01:51
Answer from the creator from Bitcoin Core slack for those also interested:
There are 2 data sets being plotted on the same graph. The red stars represent # of transactions that needed to be fetched in each block, with the count measured on the y axis. The blue dots represent the size of the message of the compact block, also measured on the y axis.
The x axis is just data from a bunch of sequential blocks over about 2 days. In other words, the data point at x axis value 50 is the data from the 50th block in the series. There are 2 data points for the 50th block: it looks like 0 fetched transactions and about 5kb as the size of the compact block message recieved.

FWIW, the much larger fees are in paying for the legal resources to complete the application.  Speaking from experience (Coinbase founder here) call it more like $40k.

On the MMM possibility, I haven't seen anything solid that would indicate it's fueling the increase in price.  I tried creating a throwaway account on it earlier to check out funding methods earlier but was unsuccessful.  My impression was that there are multiple funding methods for it, and if that's the case, I doubt that demographic is likely to be using bitcoin much.  Do you have solid information on it?  I'd love to learn more.

I have spoken with GrubHub a few months about it.  They seem open to the idea, it just wasn't at the top of their priority list at the time.  That said, it was also right before they went through the merge with Seamless, so I'm guessing they were a little distracted.
This would be awesome.
@_date: 2013-03-23 15:19:05
Hi, of course I go on here, best source for all things bitcoin :)
In terms of pending and timing issues, you're right, there are still a few issues outstanding. It seems I spoke a bit too soon last night. We've been working on it and will be again this morning. I'm sorry for the delay, I know it's been very frustrating for many given the duration.

Fred from Coinbase here.
iammagicmike, I'm very sorry you experienced difficulty.  This is an unfortunate necessity when you're selling something that isn't reversible (BTC) for a reversible, consumer friendly form of payment.
We're taking steps to improve the experience: we're actively looking for someone to handle support (if you're interested and are in San Francisco, let me know!), and have made a "service alerts" section on the Support page should there be a broader issue.  To those that have patiently waited 24-48 hours for a response, I'm genuinely sorry for any undue stress caused.
In terms of canceling a transaction because of unrealized gains or losses, I can assure you that has nothing to do with it.  I've been using Bitcoin for close to 3 years now and the reason I do what I do is because I want to see this amazing community and technology break in to the mainstream.  Trying to make a few bucks here and there in such a nascent industry in this way is something I have no interest in when the ultimate goal is so much bigger.
iammagicmike, again, I'm sorry for the difficulty and I will personally look at your account today and make sure you are made whole.  Shoot me a PM.

Again, I'm sorry for the inconvenience and stress this may have caused.

Fred from Coinbase here.
As someone who has both traded professionally and been involved in Bitcoin for a long time I appreciate how frustrating it must be to have transactions with unrealized gains be cancelled.  However, I can assure you the cancellation has nothing to do with whatever the unrealized gain or loss might be.  To give you some transparency:
-Rockhoward is right - we have a fraud expert who previously programmed at AirBnB in house to manage this.  We're using machine learning algorithms to calculate how risky a given transaction is, and it's that score alone that, if high enough, would cancel a payment.
-For people with "verified accounts" (been on the service with a transaction history for 30 days without issue) we're doing 100 BTC/day.  Since these people score very low on the risk spectrum given their history, their purchases are almost never cancelled, and the potential gain or loss of these is an order of magnitude greater than those just starting on the service with a limit of 10 BTC/day.
-Our risk scoring gets better every single day (the progress to this point is really exciting to watch internally!), and the number of false positives is dropping very quickly with time.
Again, I'm very sorry for the frustration for the very small % of users who are false positives, and I can genuinely understand.  It's just a part of us growing and getting better so we can provide a great and low cost way of purchasing bitcoin to the community, and it's getting better fast.
@_date: 2013-09-25 22:31:18
Sorry to hear you're having trouble!  We've tried to optimize these questions to present the easiest ones to answer.
I wanted to make one thing clear here - this isn't the same as a credit check, and we never ping your credit to do the verification.  Checking credit itself affects your credit score, so we don't do that.

I love the concept.  The thing I still don't get, as someone else posted, is how to close the loop on the system.

@_date: 2013-11-04 23:13:00
Hey guys - Fred from Coinbase here.
You're correct in that we receive a good amount of support emails.  Our amount also tends to be higher than other services because users tend to get their first Bitcoin on Coinbase (which is awesome!), and often have more questions as a result (which is the part we're working on).
We've actually hired 4 people in the last 2 weeks to help on support with the explicit goal of getting average response time below 24 hours.  I'm really sorry for the delay, but it's something we're actively working on.  Customer experience is the most important thing to us, so I'm genuinely sorry for the delay, and we're making it a priority to not just make support fast, but make it one of the best parts of Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-06-25 06:05:21

@_date: 2013-01-11 19:36:37
We hawk things like this and patched the Rails vulnerability you mentioned right when it was released, so I'm confident we'll stand the test of time.  We also store the vast majority (about 90%) of customer funds offline in secure storage, so such losses would be limited.

Specifying the dollar amount of a purchase is something we've thought about including and it's a good point.
We haven't done it because we thought it was just one more thing to complicate the UI, but it could be something worth trying out again.

I may be misunderstanding something here, but I believe our API allows you to perform both of these functions: 
Specifically to point 2, money earned can be both withdrawn as Bitcoin (using the send_money API call) and USD (using the sell API call).

Fred from Coinbase here - this is false.  The question here was on New York State (not FinCEN), which everyone under the sun that has touched Bitcoin received a letter from (including the Winklevii, Coinsetter, Union Square Ventures, BitPay, and everyone else): [list here](

That's a great idea - thanks for the suggestion

We had one transaction go unconfirmed and it's causing a little bit of a backlog.  Thanks to Luke Jr for mining the transaction - things should be cleared up shortly and we've taken precautions to make sure a similar issue won't occur again.
To those who have submitted support requests - I'm currently responding!  We always want to make sure the community is in touch with what's going on should anything like this arise.
As for the graph - small aesthetic only graphing plugin problem.  I wish the graph were true...

FYI, bids are orders to buy.  These would be ask walls, or walls of offers.

We're working on it - I don't want to promise anything but I hope to solve this problem rather shortly.  In terms of making Bitcoin easy to use, and iPhone app ranks pretty far up the list.
Thanks for the feedback - just sent you a tip of 0.01 BTC using [BitTip!](
Edit: app is live now!

I love the send money via SMS idea.  In countries where smartphones aren't the norm, I think this could have a huge impact on bitcoin adoption.  All it takes is making bitcoin easy enough to use and one country that has a serious inflation/currency issue and it's off to the races.

We've all lived on Soylent for a little bit here at the Coinbase offices, so we're pumped to be supporting them (and Crowdtilt!) in accepting Bitcoin.

Fred from Coinbase here - we're very excited to see this kind of activity take hold, and will make sure to mention it as a shining example on TV tomorrow.

I appreciate the update.  For those in the community who have been caught as a false positive - I'm sorry, it's an unfortunate part of our systems getting smarter.  These sorts of false positives will only decrease with time, and we can see them getting better every day.  Thanks for bearing with us - this is a great community and it's a pleasure to wake up every day to try and make bitcoin easier to buy and use.

I'm sorry to hear you haven't had a response yet - this is probably my fault.  PM me your email you use on Coinbase and I'd be happy to personally take a look.

This is, by far, the funniest thing I've seen all week.
On a serious note, we'll be implementing m of n encryption keys soon just in case Samuel L Jackson shows up.

We knew about it.  I think the original bitcointip bot is an awesome proof of concept, but it was kind of annoying to use, especially the first time experience.  We wanted to create something that could reasonably go and infect other parts of reddit because it was easy to use, so we thought it was easier to just create a little "give bitcoin" link next to each comment and have the recipient just be able to click a link to claim it.
And for fun, I just sent you a tip of 0.01 BTC using [BitTip!](
@_date: 2013-11-03 19:07:51
That's really useful feedback - thanks!
@_date: 2013-10-23 06:09:49
This is a great list - thanks!  Just sent you a tip of 0.02 BTC using [BitTip!](

This is fake.  None of these email addresses are registered on Coinbase.  Pretty clear tipoff that it's fake is that we don't have usernames (as listed on the left in this paste) in this way, and it's the same scam someone tried to run with fake info on BTC-E earlier:   Relatively clever scheme for whoever put it up though.  Thanks for the heads up nonetheless!
