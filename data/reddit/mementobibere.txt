So, state capitalism=communism in practice, although communists don't like to associate the word with these countries unless some country applies sanctions to them, then they are savage capitalists/ imperialists/ the cause of all evil and the reason why communism in those countries is not perfect (to use an eufemism)

Capitalism exists with a free market. In China the whole economy is controlled by the state. It is exactly the opposite of capitalism.

People that say that "people need to save for a rainy day and for retirement", "states need to control their finances, budget and deficit and have a financial pillow for recessions" and "people/states will have to pay to have savings" are the same people. Fuck logic. And stupid cucks say that a cashless society is the best because it is so convenient and it is impossible to have corruption/tax evasion. Well good luck with the big brother and payinf for your savings and whatever dystopian measures the goverments will think off.

No it has a maximum deduction value (I think 100 euros and that’s counting with deductions from hair cutters, hotels, car repairs and parts and other stuff). Besides you may even not be eligible for these deductions. I think more important deductions are for example ISAs and LISAs type of thing or even tax deductions when you loose money on the stock market, we don’t have that. I don’t even bother asking for a receipt, it creates more hassle just to save a few dozen cents. 
However, I don’t agree with you when you say it isn’t fair. Every country has tax deductions that only citizens/residents have access too. Besides did you know you can retire in Portugal from a lot of countries and not pay any taxes on your retirement for 10 years? Now that is not fair for the citizens...

I find the concept of paying bank fees simply ridiculous. They just need to keep a database with the amount of money I have (and they can do whatever they see fit with 98% of it, lend it, invest it, etc) and they want ME to pay? I had exemption in CGD while I was a student, then they wanted to start charging me, I switched to BPI because I had exemption with the salary domiciliation. After BPI was bought by CaixaBank I receive a letter saying they would start to charge me maintenance fees. Now I am a proud CTT bank and REVOLUT client lol. Fuck me if I will ever pay someone to lend my money.

tax deductions exist in every country.
Edit: Besides the 15% are on the 23%, so basically you get a shitty deduction. It is just a shitty measure to combat tax fraud.

Shorthing with high leverage such a volatile asset? What the hell was on this guy mind? Even if he was correct, just the volatility would make him loose everything, just like it did.

I’m not downvoting you, I just think gold always had and will always have a place in a portfolio, especially one whose objective is to stay away from economic shenanigans that fiat brings.

Because with gold you cannot start a new metal exacty like gold, from nothing, with the only difference that it shines green and is now called “grold”.

Anyway you are only taxed if you exchange bitcoin for fiat, right?
@_date: 2019-05-02 20:37:14
yes, nothing happened in practice. If you have gold, no paper trail and don't talk about it with noone else, noone will touch your gold.

but how can that be enforceable? Do I have to give my public key?
PS: Besides how do you calculate the amount of taxes you have to pay. The fiat value at that moment?
