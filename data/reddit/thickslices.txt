I've just finished writing my thesis on Bitcoin and price predictions. I am a 43 year old with a PHD in mathematics and applied sciences and have been studying stocks and data analysis for 25 years. My BTC prediction is that the price will likely rise with a probability of say 50% and we could see a dip at a estimated 50% probability. I think with the CME futures ending tomorrow we might see the price go up and then go down followed by up and down movements which result in the  price changing every few seconds.

Sorry fellow HODLERS I just sold, I could use the money. I have been in BTC since at $5K last year so fitting that I leave at $5K again. I made some money along the way and I still have two S9 miners purring away so not out completely, If the price drops further like say another few hundred I will buy back in I reckon. We dwn 10% so if a panic sell happens I will hope to find that bottom.

What I hate about bitcoin is the slow TX speed. Like I want shit to go through instantly this is internet money and it's so slow really annoying. I hope LN becomes the standard soon.

I sold yesterday and was able to buy in at like $200 lower. I increased my amount of BTC. I was super scared thinking shit I better just take my money, but then something came to mind. I always think "If only I knew about BTC in 2009 shit I would have bought like $1000 dollars worth I would be rich" The thing is if I did I surely would have sold there have been so many massive dumps. I'm taking a risk and putting my fraction of a bitcoin in cold storage and I'm just going to wait it all out if it goes to shit oh well I have only invested what I can loose. Basically I'm going to HODL and sell when there is another parabolic rise or if that doesn't come before the halving  will sell after that. Basically I would rather loose my money then think "OH my god I had BTC when it was around $4K"

Anyone else wish something would happen? Last year I joined in on the BTC ( A few months before moon circa $5000 ) What I loved and what was so exciting was when the price was going up, shit I scrambled trying to get hold of more miners. I sold at ATH and bought those dips. and sold again and made loses, but overall I made a tidy profit and was happy. I remember when I took a break from it all and noticed BTC at $12K I was like awesome buy the dip!! My point is even as it crashed I was still finding it entertaining. At the moment it's just so boring? Maybe that's why people selling up and throwing the towel in cos it's just not fun anymore? I know what you all going to reply, but c'mon surely we all loved the hikes and spikes. Also I still mine and have been HODLing for like what feels like years ( Only a few months) 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:03:30
I sold this morning in the hope that it would drop further I had to buy again when I saw it only going up like within 5 minutes. I literally felt like a panic because I had FIAT instead of my crypto. Sold at $6000 bought again at $6115 or something lol
@_date: 2018-02-17 08:26:55
Wish I was greedier when buying the dip! In terms of where we have been this is still a dip though so might continue my pound cost average.

~~Russia is going to buy all our bags boiz, don't worry about this drop it's Jihan and Roger Ver and the whales and BAKKT trying to get cheap coins. Oh did I not mention the Chinese new year as well HODL~~
I can't even leave that there, some people will take it seriously.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:41:38
Yep same, I'm actually buying another small amount now. I know seems cray, but BTC has crashed hard before so I'm taking the gamble.

When we sat at 19K these bitches said “yep I’m waiting for the price to drop to buy in” 8K BTC is dirt cheap. I wish you all knew what I know. Save this comment seriously I will eat a donkeys cock if BTC isn’t worth 1 million dollars in 1000 years

If BTC drops any further you will be able to find me in the kitchen pouring boiling hot kettle water into my eyes.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:39:18
I've only invested what I am totally comfortable in loosing I also took profits at 18K and BTC has purchased two tickets to NY for my wife and I ( We from UK ) I also mine my BTC. I will be buying a small amount again now and will HODL. I have taken advice and researched like hell when I first started and this is why I think I ended up in the good place I am in now. If you bought in at 19K may God bless you lol. Maybe sell and buy back in when it raches like $5K which it probably will IMO. To be honest I'm just a mechanic WTF do I know? I knew this was a gamble and I have faired well from it. I will HODL with the rest of my brave soldiers and can only hope we crawl out of this dark wet trench and onto the steps that will take us to the moon in like a couple months? IDFK it was fun as hell and I will sink with this ship.

When the Bitcoin price drops I tend to hodl onto my cat. Cat just hissed and ran off with a arched back at full speed. My hands are strong and I’m getting more fiat ready to buy in, oh hey kitty come fucken hodl me while I ruin ya financially 
@_date: 2018-02-08 08:16:48
I want to try day trade, basically I’m about to sell so the price is definitely about to skyrocket so keep hodling fam I’m taking one for the team.
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:09:38
My hodlings are all in wallet and 10% play with on exchange cos exchanges get hacked and I can’t say trade for shit, but I try anyway I just made 6 dollars on DGB.

People will be jealous as fuck when they look upon us as early adopters who purchased BTC at sub 20K prices. Imagine BTC at 1 million $ people then will be like oh yeah buy the dip at 956 000 lads hahah we going to the moon for lambos. We will be like yeah man we chilling on the 3rd moon of the outer galaxy known as Bcashlol

@_date: 2018-02-06 14:46:36
I just don't have the balls. I'm waiting for that massive spike in volume at the  bottom where ever it may be. I probably HODL some FIAT for a buy in when the bottom becomes clear. This BTC buying and selling can be a bitch though cos I might  miss that trip to the moon after HODLing for so long

My question to you is, if you could fuck a supermodel for the rest of your life and had to use a condom every time would you? Or would you fuck a ugly girl with two teeth and a fucken huge bush with no condom what would you choose? 
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:31:29
Can someone help/ explain this- So if you go onto bitcoin calculator on the site crypto compare you will see that even if your electricity per KW/h is $0.1c you will still loose $1.39 per day. How are any of the large mining firms even open? Must loose a few thousand dollars a day depending on size, most have 1000's of Antminer S9 running.
Edit: Meant to say this is the loss for running 1 antminer a day
