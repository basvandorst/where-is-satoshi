It's a wallet just not your wallet.

I just use coinbase for this. Scannable QR codes make spending eth,btc,ltc at the merchant easy as hell.

Yes exactly how I interpreted it. They cant go off and print 10 million more bitcoin after you worked your ass of for two months for a single 1.

Small price to pay for saving the planet if you ask me. Obviously he is a weird guy and I have no excuses for for what he said. But tbh I dont care he fucked up and apologized so I'm over it. Let's not forget he was there trying to save those kids same as the diver.

Which means the price wont be affected *positively because they dodged the order book/depth chart and just made a private transaction. But now they can sell on an exchange which WILL affect the price.

So how does this work is the private key printed on the receipt or do you supply your own address?

No it doesn't. The intial valuation and start of btc was made possible because of people willing to spend it like this. Without the million dollar pizza and other similar early adopters spending their btc we wouldn't be where we are today.

Thought i would add this, another way to quit smoking cigarettes that worked for me (Almost 1 year now) was to start vaping. Obviously it would be much healthier to just stop smoking all together. But if you start having problems staying off cigs, this could really help. You still get your nicotine fix, but you subtract most of whats  hurting you in regular cigarettes. Nicotine itself is as bad for you as caffeine is. Just like caffeine its not "good" for you. But its considerably less damaging then regular cigs. After about about 6 months of vaping, i ended up quiting that too!  I know this is unrealted to Bitcoin, i just wanted to help out the OP with how i quit. Either way good luck!

Just because it's being tested doesn't mean it doesn't exist dude lol
All I was debating was your original statement that there were no actions being taken to scale. Which is frankly just untrue.

I have also heard tales that if you give the same one food for a while they will eventually make a habit of coming back and might also bring things to you.

Sharding POS, State channel networks and also raiden, plasma omg. Oh yeah and off chain transactions (yes lighting network for ethereum) 
You missed 5+ scaling solutions and may have some reading to do :)

No. That's what "tesnet" means.
@_date: 2018-07-14 20:52:58
Wow that's crazy this whole time I thought this was built to visualize the transaction traffic and always viewed it as very pro btc. But yeah reading the faqs it seems this built to showcase bch....? 
@_date: 2018-07-01 18:53:56
All of them. Check out the test net.
