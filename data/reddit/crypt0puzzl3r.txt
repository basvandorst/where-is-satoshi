Here is the puzzle's intended solution:
To begin with, there are twelve four\-letter seed words in alphabetical order on the right, encoded in 8\-puzzles.  Each 8\-puzzle is a letter of the alphabet represented on the left by the blue dot tiles. Each set of the 8\-puzzle tiles can be solved by placing  the numbers in an 8\-puzzle’s goal order.
The  words on the right of the puzzle are on Rot\-13, and the numbers in the  gray square below represent the numerical equivalent, in sequential  order, of the first letter of each Rot\-13 word.  
The final step is to convert the Rot\-13 to its equivalent seed word, revealing the order of the mnemonic phrase.

Thank you to all the puzzlers and commenters that participated in the process of cracking the puzzle, through this Reddit thread, as well as my host's Telegram group, Discord channel, Twitter, etc. There are many of you, and your efforts, input, insights and participation are impressive.
Special mention to Marti Kaljuve, for decoding the seed words through inventive and alternative methods of deducing the Rot\-13 conversion.
Special mention also to user Arpox for discovering how the numerical string in gray was necessary to complete the decryption of the mnemonic seed.

You can create a wallet with any valid mnemonic seed phrase, but if it's not the exact mnemonic seed phrase that cryptogreetings chose, this would result in the creation of a completely unrelated wallet.
