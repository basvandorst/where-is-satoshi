Bitcoin being used by the fastest growing sector in the USA must be bad, right?

In the developed world it's generally considered bad to have to hussle for welfare in order to eat, rather than spend that energy finding a job.

I last bought in November and I'm still significantly up (~20%). Some people would never admit to btc dying (if it did) but there's really nothing too bad right now, or if it is, there's nothing out of the ordinary to suggest btc is dying.

Can't you just put $250/month in there and then move it out again the next day? 
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:48:01
Ah, ok. In the UK there's not the same level of restriction. My wife and I have like 4 or 5 accounts that we put some money through and back out again to get several bonuses, this is quite common here.

I don't see why this is the only option? Can't they just arrest the guiltiest parties and fine the institute?

You won't, op asked for coins going from wallet A to wallet B, if his friend would be happy to use 500 wallets with 1 coin in each that would be pretty hard to show, although if they were publicly known to be his it would essentially he the same.

Is it just me or is the majority of this video just reassuring buzzwords with some "bitcoin is bad, ok?" thrown in?
@_date: 2014-12-04 12:58:14
I don't think that there is a way, if you have 500 coins one day and a week later you have none and I can see that your friend gets an increase in his public wallet  of 500 coins it's pretty obvious.
I think the best suggestion is to tumble many small amounts over a long period of time to make it hard to see the pattern.

So the first paragraph: what you're saying is basically the banks stealing everyone's money, I very much doubt that would happen as you'd have massive unrest amongst all working classes (and by this I mean anyone who works and gets paid for their labor). 
I'm not sure what you're saying in the 2nd paragraph.

The kg is the base unit for mass in the SI system because of how it is defined. It is, however, the only base unit which has a prefix already attached. It's pretty much because the Kg is a more "real life" weight than the g, I believe.

Surely negative interest would never happen as mortgages would either be cancelled or would benefit the borrower and people would just withdraw all savings and put their money into mattresses instead.

I haven't tried it at 1440 as my monitor is a 144Hz 1080 one.

So is there an easy way for me to convert my btc to bcash without compromising my btc keys? I've been using btc for years (never hodl'd much tbh, made a few hundred though and I'm hodling a few hundred I bought at ~$6k) but haven't seen a way of getting my bcash without sending a dodgy wallet the keys for my btc too.

I've not played the latest patch (or two) but 70-120 depending on where I am and what's going on. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 10:33:35
I he's saying that 144Hz at 1440 is better than 1080 at a higher refresh rate and also better than 4k at (for example) 60hz. If you're wondering why not high resolution and refresh rate it's because there are limits in terms of gpu and also cost.

I7 7700k and 1080 and I run it on pretty much max at 1080p.

Why do you use Gmail as your professional email address, rather than using your own domain?

Spend the time looking through them. If it takes you 12 hours that's still nearly $5k an hour.

I don't see why peer funded finance isn't  an option. Isn't most of the money banks lend out just other people's savings? 
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:40:25
They way I have seen it in the past (these systems do exist, but as small scale alternatives to banks) is like this:
You have $1000 to invest, you give this to a middleman who splits your $1000 into 100 $10 lots and shares them into 100 different loans which are rated at interest rates that are high enough for the middleman to take a small cut anf you to get a profit without crippling the debtor with high payments. The interest rates. The middleman puts some of his cut aside to cover the occasional case where someone defaults on their loan (this is optional as any one lender should only lose one $10 investment from a bad loan).
In some cases you can choose who gets your money, so you don't have the middleman necessarily choosing who gets credit and who doesn't (so for example a school might need a new science lab, but not be attractive investment but you could choose to lend them the money because you value the community). I'm no expert, I've just heard the concept a few times and like the idea as an alternative to large banks determining who gets credit based solely on how profitable it is for them, especially considering that most of 'their' capital isn't even theirs.

If you wanted a loan of $1000 you'd actually be getting $10 from 100 investors.

Glad to see you guys took the hit and not just leaving the problem on the customers. (I know it sounds a bit shitty, but it was your fault).
I'm interested by this, do you have any low-stake or free tables for new players to try it out?

I know that some SR staff members/mods/vendors purposely change up the syntax and phrasing they use to help anonymize themselves further.
@_date: 2013-07-12 21:34:24
For what? You move the money you have earned and payed tax on into bitcoin, after that what you do with it can be anonymous.

Find a hosting company that takes bitcoin and doesn't require a clearnet email address would be my guess.

You buy bitcoin with details then move it to another, anon, wallet.
