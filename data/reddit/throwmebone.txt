There are probably some initiatives against those kinds of seizing. You can join those. (also states - AFAIK - are slowly legalizing marijuana, which will help.) 
I am not saying governments are perfect but at least there are laws and there is a justice system (however slow and ineffective). In bitcoin there is nothing. Somebody steals your money - tough luck.

Oh. So it's not "PayPal accepts bitcoin" or "eBay accepts bitcoin", but it's a payment processor that supports paypal, that also supports bitcoin.
Well that can be good. But I am not sure if it's really that helpful; the startups still need coinbase account, and at that point, the startups could have used coinbase account instead.
But it's making implementation of bitcoin payments easier. So that's sort of good. But it still converts bitcoins immediately into dollars through coinbase.

Installing Linux is still PITA. Hardware still - in 2014 - has problems  with this or that, this thing that doesn't work, that thing that doesn't work - because the manufacturer doesn't publish drivers, and so on.
See for example this friendly guide for installing Ubuntu on newest MacBook pro. Easy as pie.
edit: and be wary that you have to rewrite all those shell skripts exactly, since there is a difference between `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="libata.force=noncq"` that you have to write, and not for example `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX = "libata.force=noncq"` (because that's how bash works). Easy! Just works!

I don't know why people think tipping is some magic key that will allow people to see the Bitcoin usefullness.
People hate it, developers of software on tip4commit hate it, people think its's spam. Tipping somebody fractions of dollars at a time is essentially useless.
And it has never shown to be effective. Dogecoin's community is all based on tipping all the time, and it didn't boost its adoption significantly.
Adoption will not happen because kids tip each other in YouTube comments.
@_date: 2014-11-22 02:23:01
Well the thing is, changetip is essentially just another centralized accounting service.
The centralization allows to be quicker and cheaper, because bitcoin is hilariously slow, ineffective and expensive (in computing power);  that's the price it pays for decentralization.
Decentralization is not easy; decentralization is hard. If you want decentralization, you will end up with bitcoin clone. (Or maybe a Ripple clone, but I never understood how Ripple works.)

It's literally cents though. Higher tips than 1 dollar is extremely rare.
Also, I think most people at this point have *heard* about bitcoin. It was all over the news. USA Today had its *logo* changed into Bitcoin for one time. It's not that it's just some unknown thing people haven't heard.
People heard about bitcoin, they just don't want it/need it. Why not change *that* by making it better and more useful, instead of just shoving it in people's throats?
@_date: 2014-11-11 14:28:59
You don't need to mine anything if you just want to send/receive bitcoins.
Having 1 dollar in bitcoin is kind of useless, as most of the tips are. You can't really exchange it for anything, buy anything with it, and it's not worth the exchange hassles. (I am very much against tipping, as you can probably tell, I think they are useless and annoying.)
From the top of my head, you can basically
* keep it and hope people will tip you more so it *will* be worth the hassle (or hope bitcoin will rise in price - which will probably never happen)
* tip it to someone else
* give it to some charity
* throw it away
and that's it.

I am not a US citizen, so I don't really understand the law system, but it seems like he is a part of New York State Department of Financial Services, which is a state agency.
So the only thing you could do, in my opinion, is move to New York and pay proper taxes there. But again, I have no idea how US state/federal budget works, so maybe just being a US citizen is enough.
If you are not a US citizen, all you can do, I guess, is to buy US products in general, which will help US economy and, therefore, will bring more money to Ben Lawsky.

I will bite.
I recently tried paying for porn, just to try it. On a well known porn website (not owned by manwin/mindgeek, AFAIK).
The result was a website that was *harder* to use than Manwin-tubes, it had less content, it had weird, shady and unclear payment processing, and it started spamming my web address one second after I registered (I registered an e-mail just for the porn website; I got tons of porn spam immediately afterwards).
It's possible that Manwin-owned porn websites (like brazzers and whatnot) will have better payment processing and better websites, that aren't that painful to use. But the shit I tried was terrible.
If "illegal" Manwin-tubes are easier to use than "legal" websites, I have no reason to pay.

@_date: 2014-10-02 10:17:14
I will be the first one here to *actually* explain it. 
It's not really good or bad, it's what Satoshi decided when he made bitcoin, quite arbitrarily. (A lot of things in bitcoin are arbitrary, because Satoshi just decides "that's how it's gonna be".) 
First, it's necessary that in the decentralized system that works like bitcoin, the money newly mined is predictable and known in advance. Nobody has come with how would you determine the amount in a decentralized way and adjust the inflation somehow ; you need a central bank for that, bitcoin doesn't have that and doesn't *want* that. 
Also, Satoshi's thinking was : if the amount of money newly mined is decreasing, it will push people to adopt the currency and start mining *now* rather than in the future, because mining will be less profitable on the future, and with the people coming in, adoption will rise. You have to remember that, unlike regular currencies that are more or less forced on you, bitcoin is *voluntary*, so it has to attract people for using it. 
I got a slight problem with that and I think it amounts to MLM. And it unfairly favors early adopters. But that was Satoshi's goal: to push people to be early adopters. 
Another side - effect was that it attracted gold standard "end the Fed" nutjobs, which is all I will say about them. 
And that's about it. Predictable money supply is a necessity in cryptocurrency ; decreasing money supply was chosen by Satoshi to get early adopters.

Not really with the falling price. If I put 1000 in Bitcoin today, and I pay all the fees, I will have 800 next month.
Internationally - mayyyyybe, although I just paid money by PayPal from Europe to Hong Kong (for [TrainChinese subscription]( and it took seconds. In SOME edge cases - that don't apply to me - it can be faster but I can't really see any *real life* use cases. (That's partly why I asked it here)
Domestically - no


Not really, I need a special Trezor hardware to really feel safe that nobody will steal all my money. Not really convenient. And once some malware fakes the receiving BTC address - all my money is gone, irreversibly. Charbacks with cards are much simpler.


That's a plus, but again, mostly hypothetical. I rarely see international shops that don't accept credit cards. I never ever encountered an international shop that accepts bitcoin, except when specifically looking for it.
OK, real example. I love tea from Taiwan. I can put "tea from taiwan" to google and find tons of Taiwanese shops that sell it that accept credit cards that will send it from there directly here (Europe). I can find *only one shop* that accepts bitcoin, and that one has a small selection of tea and ships it from US (which is kind of stupid to do if I am in Europe), and costs *way too much* (both the tea and the shipping).
So the "not affected by borders" is, again, purely hypothetical. *When everyone in the future will accept bitcoin it will be borderless*. Well, the reality is different.


Well, I have my usecases, but they are all slightly illegal. And *that's* in my opinion where Bitcoin shines.

price between 100 and 200 (I say 120). I feel it has its usage in the legally grey (or downright black) economy. I don't know what is the size of that, but it's useful there. for better or worse. 
Sidechains / colored coins / smart contracts are a mirage, a virtual thing. Nobody really wants or needs that. 
There will never be a big consumer adoption because it's not really needed outside of a legally gray cases.

Thanks for your answer. 
Why do you use bitcoin for all the things you mentioned; why not use stuff like credit cards that are much more convenient (and I would bet all the shops that support bitcoins also support credit cards)? Is it mostly the bitcoin ideology? I don't see any convenience in using Bitcoin. You don't need to buy gyft cards to pay with credit card or cash.

Maybe not so moronic, I'm not sure
I am looking at sidechains
It seems to me they are kind of useless. In order for them to work, the bitcoin network has to be able to read the SPV proof of work, which in turn restricts them terribly
They can't be PoS, just PoW that main blockchain understands, which means the same hashing algorithm
That in turn would remove the possibility of Litecoin-like sidechain, for example, as a side-chain
@_date: 2015-01-26 08:29:25

Backwards compatibility.
People understate it a lot. Backwards compatibility is why we still use phone numbers and SMS. Backwards compatibility is why we use use online protocols that kinda suck, but it's hard to move on.
And it's the same thing with money - online banking should be backwards compatible with "offline" banking (at least from the start); credit cards should be working where they worked before, and so on.
That's why it's so hard to change things and why we use old technology wherever possible.

Shit Reddit Says - subreddit on twitter that sometimes react, sometimes overreact on percieved homophobia, racism, etc. on reddit.
I personally think that they are sometimes right, but it's just stupid to waste all this energy on finding random racist and *-phobic comments everywhere.

Can you imagine having to wait 3 hours in store, and then additional 5 hours "just to be sure"?

zerocash is always *always* ***always*** just a few months away.
Wake me up when it's done.

Except for stress tests. And maleabilities. And unintentional forks. Which happens about once a month. 
But other than that, not affected.

Nguyen is a *very* common Vietnamese name. About half of the country is a Nguyen.

That's written in a similarly weird way as the Craig's proof. Huh.

Now that's just cruel. Taiwan is so awesome *because* it's independent on China. You can actually *go out and breathe* without suffocating in smoke.
(Although KMT was kind of shit too. But that's for another debate.)

Poor admins.

Oh, thanks.
That's what I was looking for. Thanks!

And yes, I know blockchain.info is not the "real" blockchain, but come on, you know many people use it as such.

In Namecoin, there is this very weird, pre-defined value of namecoins that disappears in *every registration* transaction. For no real reason.
It doesn't go to miners. It doesn't go to "the network" (whatever would that mean). It just becomes unspendable. Forever.
The value is pre-defined and the developers are changing it at will. (It's even worse than the pre-defined fees in the bitcoin; you can always set your own fees, the miners can always choose to accept it. Not with namecoins.)
It's sort of retarded, I think.

autistic rants like this without any real substance is why I hate this subreddit
