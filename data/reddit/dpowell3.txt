Yeah that’s the post - I don’t know where I got that private key to begin with, I use Bread wallet and I can’t find any private keys on my app - I’m pretty sure that number came from BitCypher when I put the transaction ID Into it?

The issue is I went on their forum and gave what I thought was the address of the transaction? The number started with a 5 but now I’m freaking out because I read you shouldn’t give out any number starting with a 5

I gave out an address starting with a ‘5’ which I’ve learned now shouldn’t be given out, is there any way I can get my btc back or are they lost forever?

This is where I got that address starting with a ‘5’

Because I gave it out on that forum and now I’m scared someone can steal my bitcoins?

Thanks - the number starting with a 5 has been penned over so you can’t see it - I got that number from entering in the address to BlockChain.info

You live and you learn I’m just so thankful it wasn’t a huge amount of money

This has been resolved turns out it was the transaction ID just so happened to start with a 5 :) still waiting for the transaction to confirm but stupidly low fee

Thanks gbitg- even though I gave that address starting with a 5? I can’t even delete the forum post now
