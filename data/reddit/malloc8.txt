I'm working on fixing this Roxcoin hilarity.  If they don't follow through, they're out.

Ideally, altcoins would be much less about their manipulated market value, and primarily about promoting cryptocurrencies as a whole through community engagement.  If I can help promote Bitcoin by allowing specialized cryptocurrencies to promote to a particular audience, then I think I'm doing some good for all cryptocurrencies.

I play a laptop using a track pad and sometimes code.
I also play several analogue synths and an electribe :)
I got into music through early instruments, but I got excited about music when I got a recording interface, midi keyboard, and FL studio when I was 11!

Well, here's some background.  The Sport Coats / Suits that you'll see on the site are sold at Neiman Marcus for $3,000+
Luckily, we imported overstock directly from Italy, and are selling them on our site for $500-ish each in USD.
If we start getting tips below 40% off of the BTC equivalent, we'll probably have to shut down this offer, or change the model (refunds if the tip is too low?)  Beyond that, I hope the tips aren't much off the BTC equivalent of our prices, but I won't panic if they are within that range.
The idea behind this is to see people actually valuing items in BITCOIN rather than FIAT currencies!  Unfortunately for me, that means assuming some risk, but for now I'm considering it a fun experiment!

I am not involved in Roxcoin, and I definitely hear your concerns.  First of all, Bitcoin will be accepted from day one.
To me, this was about two things: additional giveaways for artists and participants, and showing the crypto community that altcoins should be less about a group or individual heavily invested in the coin, and more about community endeavors around the coin.
Some key members in the roxcoin community offered us significant giveaway funds for getting artists in to dyf.fm (ie. if you link your soundcloud track, you'll get free rox). To me, that seems like a move in the right direction.  I've been posting in the Bitcointalk rox thread with similar sentiments and have been pushing the core members to continue this behavior.  Honestly, I don't know if they will or won't, but all I can do as an individual is lead by example.

Sure! 
The basic action on Dyf.fm will boil down to two things: playing and sharing
If you're playing, you're both listening to tracks and placing wagers on the future popularity of those tracks in a social environment.  You'll be presented with two soundcloud tracks head to head and will have the option to wager that one track will increase in popularity more than the other one for some given time period.  Popularity will be assessed as a combination of soundcloud plays and likes for that track.
Let's assume that at the end of the wager period there is 1 bitcoin on track A and 3 bitcoin on track B, and that for the game time period, track A goes up 40% and track B goes up 20%.  Players who wagered on track A have one, and have been given natural p2p odds of 3 to 1.  They will be returned their wagers on track A as well as a portion of the 3 bitcoin pool on track B.  Players who decided on track B will be returned the remainder of their 3 bitcoin pool after it is distributed.
On the other side of things is users who are sharing tracks as well as artists.  This is the exciting part!  Artists whose tracks have wagers placed on them will receive a % of the volume on their track.  Alternatively, if a dyf.fm user shares a track which is not their own and is from an artist who has not linked their soundcloud, the sharer will receive a smaller portion of the % volume while the remainder is held for the original artist.  As soon as the artist links their soundcloud they will have BTC waiting for them!

I'll be here to field questions for a bit!

Dyffy is a social network for trading and managing your coins.  Current coin exchanges lack community engagement, and strive to be too serious!
We're building out our prototype and working toward a beta launch, but I'm finding that in order for me to work full time on this project, I'll need to liquidate my existing business!
@_date: 2014-07-07 22:02:28
Thanks! As an independent musician, I definitely agree. Dyf.fm was meant as a preview to our later product, Dyffy, which will launch in a month, but I really believe that it has huge potential on its own.
I'm really focused on finding ways to bring new communities into bitcoin, rather than just making products for existing users, and I think this is a perfect way to bring musicians in.

Is Bitcoin secure?
