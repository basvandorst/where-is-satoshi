Beware, the Core team is expecting attacks and maybe some hacks replacing the installer with a installer with malware. Get the GPG key of the project and, before you run the installer, verify the file is good.

@_date: 2017-02-06 22:46:24
Do you want to make bitcoin stay at 1MB until the end of the times? With high risks, high gains.
See that. If the blockchain is suffering with this volume, what will happen when it doubles?
@_date: 2017-02-06 18:26:23
Changing a variable is objectively safer and better. 
We'll see what happens with Litecoin and segwit. Probably nothing good.
@_date: 2017-02-06 22:41:52
Because the bitcoin supply would grow x2 at the same time. And it is OK how it is now.
@_date: 2017-02-06 18:13:16
That is just a isolated event. That's a logical fallace.
What makes you think that with 2MB or 4 Mb blocks people will do that attack? Why isn't it happening every day now?
That sounds like fear campaign.
And, it people would, there are spam filters that can detect that kind of transactions and reject it. That doesn't deny anyone to send a transaction. If you have a really big transaction to do, like that one, split it in 2 or 3.
@_date: 2017-02-06 20:53:18
Please explain.
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:58:04
Do I have to remember you that Satoshi only put the 1MB block restriction for some time and then it was going to be removed.
Unfortunately, Shatosi disappeared before that.

Why building a complex extra centralized software when you can just change a number?
@_date: 2017-02-06 18:34:15
*5* was just an example. I meant to say that a few small transactions like that one could do the same.
@_date: 2017-02-06 16:36:00
Then why, genious?
You can't deny the undeniable.
@_date: 2017-02-06 16:26:15
Spoiler: the fee is that high because of the small block size.
@_date: 2017-02-06 18:33:04
Yes it is, see the slippery slope fallacy and the anecdotal fallacy.
Still, in case of a hardfork to 2MB, people will figure out how to stop that kind of spam. Probably.

Hardware also is improved over time. There isn't any reason to not upgrade to 2MB blocks. I don't even say 4MB, maybe that would be necessary in 5 years.

That doesn't rest importance to the miners. It is a symbiosis.
@_date: 2017-02-06 18:25:02
And? It is still a viable attack. 5 of those transactions would do the same than a 2mb transaction of that kind.

There are some times that several blocks are found quickly and the mempool is empty. Then a block is found and the mempool is not 1mb yet again.

As the current 1MB size linit, you can put a 1MB or 750 KB transaction size limit.

No way, the chain with most hashrate would be the winner. The rest of chains would get a block or less in an hour, so maintain them would be a hell expensive, because the difficulty reconf occurs each 2016 blocks. At the end, all miners would choose to mine if the biggest chain.

Lol the brainwashing. A hard-fork is **NOT** the launch of an altcoin!!! It is an upgrade to the protocol, like ipv4 to ipv6.

Do you seriously think that 8mb blocks would be full inmediatly?
The blocks wouldn't even be a quarter full.

And if activated, "segwit coins" could not be spendeable with and older client.
Bumping the block size is just changing maxBlockSize to 2, 4 or whatever you want.

No, you're wrong. Most of bitcoin Unlimited supporters agree with 4MB or 8MB. Even I would agree with 2MB. 2MB would fix the problem for a few years.
