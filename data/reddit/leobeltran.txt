And? Still a “node” doesn’t do any validation without mining. And beyond privacy reasons, I don’t see why anyone would run a node. It literally does nothing on the network.
@_date: 2019-07-22 17:13:41
Bits are the ideal unit for bitcoin!
1 000 000 bits = 1 bitcoin.
1 bit = 0,000 001 00 bitcoin. 
You even have two decimal places left for satoshis, like cents in most currencies, so 100 sat = 1 bit.
We could set the price of things in bits.
So your ice cream would be 234,89 bits.

@_date: 2019-07-24 11:32:41
It does validation, that’s true, but it doesn’t enforce anything, because it doesn’t have any hashpower.
I think that Satoshi stated that only miners would run nodes in the future.

*Propaganda* doesn’t have to have a bad connotation. When I talk about crypto to my friends so they can adopt it, it’s propaganda.
I didn’t troll, I just commented a reasonable doubt anyone could have. Why should I ask merchants to accept Bitcoin if it’s just a store of value?

I love it. But if the scaling problem is not solved, other cryptocurrencies will take its place to make payments.

Paying the fees to open a channel with a well connected node.
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:44:15
This is probably fine. Unless it is an urgent transaction, you will still have it confirmed. Take into account that, if you want to reliably use Bitcoin, you should use a good fee estimator.
@_date: 2019-06-18 18:06:09
Hey, they at least are clear saying that support Bitcoin Cash, which is a fork of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-11 21:54:31
I’ve never spent more than a cent on transaction fees.
@_date: 2019-06-05 13:35:28
And they charge you that because that’s what it costs to them to move those bitcoins after they were sent.
@_date: 2019-02-21 13:27:27
That’s why I also offer help! I know this is complicated, but if at least one starts accepting Bitcoin, to me it’s a success.
@_date: 2019-02-25 19:31:08
Probably because who sent the transaction paid a really small fee, thus making it take longer to process. You should see the transaction confirmed in a couple hours. 
@_date: 2019-02-21 13:37:51
Right! And that’s what I put in the description. You don’t have to pay to accept it!
@_date: 2019-06-19 23:34:40
I support this kind of propaganda and I believe Bitcoin was meant to be spent and actually used. Thank you for this, I’m certainly going to use it.
However, I don’t know why this sub is trying to maintain a double discourse.  Saying that Bitcoin is a “store of value,” that high fees are just fine, and that you must “hodl” (personally I disagree with all of that) is mostly incompatible with the idea of Bitcoin as a currency for day-to-day use and asking merchants to accept it.
The reality is that Bitcoin is not a currency anymore and the project has taken a different direction to the original vision. I like the Lightning Network, but it’s currently unusable for the purpose it was created for.
Again, thank you very much. It’s just I can’t see a solution to this fundamental contradiction.

I’m a Dvorak keyboard user. Instead of the traditional QWERTY layout, I learned to type with this much simpler and easier layout. It’s been around since the 30s, but still hasn’t replaced the QWERTY keyboard despite being vastly superior.
Bitcoin will replace every shitty national currency, however.
@_date: 2019-02-25 19:37:15
No problem! You can also paste the transaction ID on a block explorer to see how many confirmations it has.
@_date: 2019-06-12 00:21:16
You’ll hodl because it’s the only thing you can do with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-02-25 19:50:39
I just assumed they paid 1 sat/byte, and from my experience those transactions eventually get confirmed. But you’re right, it could stay there a long time.
@_date: 2019-06-05 13:31:41
Are you being serious? This is not a problem with just Bitpay, but with Bitcoin too. Fees are simply too high to be used as a currency.
Some people here suggest that the Lighting Network is a good solution. Consider this: You have to pay the fee to open a channel with limited capacity (+2 USD), paying a watchtower (let’s assume +0 USD), paying the fee to close the channel (+2 USD), and paying the fee to reopen it when it runs out of bitcoins (+2 USD). Not to mention all the technical work involved. Grand total: 6 USD.
For that money you could have sent 6k transactions when the fees where a tenth of a penny.
Don’t complain about Bitpay and if you don’t like paying with BTC, don’t use it. It’s a free market.
@_date: 2019-02-21 15:21:48
@_date: 2019-06-05 17:25:41
25 cents is a lot for many people. And you know that, if people start using Bitcoin, fees are going to skyrocket, right? Expect to see fees going as high as $20 per transaction. There are no Lighting Network or SegWit that can resist that. 
And stop blaming BitPay. I only used it once and I don’t like it, but they are free to exist and invest in every coin they want. If you don’t like them, don’t use their service. And don’t complain if you choose to use a coin that has higher fees than every other coins combined.

I truly dislike the elitist thinking of some BTCers.
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:51:39
The worst case scenario was December 2017, where a low fee transaction could be stuck in the mempool for numerous days, even more than a week. That is likely not happening right now, but it could because of the limited blocksize.
Also, use SegWit for cheaper fees. Not ideal, but it works.
@_date: 2019-06-10 13:24:08
If you don’t want that, you could use a coin that provides some sort of anonymity or obfuscation. That is very hard to do with Bitcoin, unfortunately.
@_date: 2019-06-12 12:15:29
Can you actually buy other cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin? That’s cool.
@_date: 2019-06-23 18:46:58
There are two states of this sub:
* If fees are low: “Look, fees are low, I can send a transaction with a 1 sat/b fee and get it confirmed next block, Bitcoin is great, every other coin is a crapcoin.”
* If fees are insanely high: “Bitcoin is not a currency, it’s a store of value, you must pay if you want security, use segwit addresses, use replace-by-fee or wait, use fiat for daily payments, fees are good for miners.”
Take a side or be more consistent. Most other serious coins solved these problems a long time ago.
@_date: 2019-06-14 22:40:39
I must say that it’s interesting why people seem to care about fees while saying that Bitcoin was meant to be a store of value and not a currency to do daily transactions.
You’re right, people are not using SegWit, but that doesn’t mean that, if sufficiently used, fees would go down.
@_date: 2019-06-05 17:32:04
Saying that BCH has lower fees that BTC is a fact. It is not shilling.
@_date: 2019-06-23 18:47:43
@_date: 2019-06-01 19:28:29
I like adoption and progress, but didn’t you tell them that they shouldn’t be using Bitcoin because “it was not designed to be used as a currency?” How are they going to accept it with those fees?
@_date: 2019-06-01 19:45:12
@_date: 2019-06-24 23:40:43
But the Lighting Network doesn’t work. It won’t scale without central hubs controlling it (financial institutions that can be subjected to censorship and regulations) and when the fees rise above 500 sats per byte, nobody will be able to open or close channels. 
Also, you will have to pay watchtower fees, and probably trust a third party with your funds. 
Certainly that’s not what I image when I think about Bitcoin.

Hope you like and love Google, Facebook and every big corporation that makes software to use for “free” and don’t criticize them. Also scammers do software for “free.”
That someone makes free software doesn’t mean they are entitled to entirely positive feedback only. If you think otherwise, you are fundamentally wrong. Stating my personal opinions doesn’t mean I’m a dick or not grateful for the time they invested. In fact, it is sometimes good to see people suggesting you ways to improve what you provide, and you should see that as a valuable thing as well.

As I pointed in my post, I had no problem using the app. It was the feeling that something was going on behind what made me do a little research.

Essentially, my country. I live in Argentina, where our neoliberal government back in 2015 used the power of the Central Bank to increase the price of the US dollar, so the ministers could make a profit out of it. Also the last year we saw a big increase of our external debt… in order to pay for our external debt. We also had to pay more for electricity and gas, because the main companies here are owned by the same group. So yes, I believe they can and do control the economy.
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:29:01
But how can I open a channel if I have to spend a big amount of my funds to pay the normal transaction fee?
@_date: 2019-05-29 05:00:49
Lightning is not ready or stable yet, and many people don’t know or don’t want to run a node in order to accept payments. Also, you must pay an on-chain transaction fee, which completely defeats the purpose.
@_date: 2019-05-11 11:01:08
No, they use their devaluated local currency and rest trapped in the financial system.
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:51:25
Using bitcoinfees.net I see that there are more than 5 thousand transactions waiting to be confirmed for that fee. I assume it will take a long time and I doubt a merchant in Venezuela would wait for that long.
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:45:36
I understand your point, but you are not addressing my concerns. Many people can’t pay those fees because they live on less than 3 dollars per day. Using 33% of that just to pay for transaction seems like a lot to me.
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:40:28
Thank you for understanding. Right now I’m looking more outside Bitcoin because of the reasons I mentioned. In the near future maybe I will have to try to use altcoins to transact, which defeats the purpose of Bitcoin in the first place, sadly.
@_date: 2019-05-29 13:53:08


Bitcoin does work, but the Lightning Network is particularly unuseful right now. There are even some algorithmical problems like how the payment will be routed. This cannot be ignored and the Lightning Network is just a medium term solution. Lightning will become centralized this way.


How do these wallets manage the fact you need to be online? Do you need to hire a watchtower?


Merchants won’t be running any nodes in the future. The blockchain will be too big to store in a home node. Bitcoin already has a solution for that: Simple Payment Verification. If the technology doesn’t improve, yhe merchants then will not use Bitcoin as a payment method or they will use other cryptocurrencies.

Well, Bitcoin is, for most people, something they cannot mine. At most they could run their own “full node,” meaning they can store the whole blockchain to verify their own transactions only, but nothing more.
Someday, if Bitcoin gets large enough, the blockchain will contain terabytes of transactions. When that day comes, people will not be running their own nodes anymore and the verification and creation of new coins will be done by those who can afford it. It will still be a decentralized network because it will not depend on any of the miners.
