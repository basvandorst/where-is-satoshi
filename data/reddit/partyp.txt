  has studied and written a lot in the space. Pretty sure he contributed code too. He's also just a cool dude. Oh and he teaches 
Not just a rando.
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:58:11
Which issue?
@_date: 2014-07-17 15:18:28
I feel like thats similar to saying, "Even though that guy raped her, he did it in a real cool way." 
@_date: 2014-05-16 19:44:37
Is there a place I can get these printed using bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-06-11 15:29:48
I seriously need them for a car rental right now! Looks like only accepting hotels :(  
@_date: 2014-07-16 16:05:48
Yea i use DuckDuckGo for all my searching. If I cant find what I want I !g it.
@_date: 2014-05-25 23:02:13
Awesome! Does this have any relation to coinmap.org? 
@_date: 2014-07-17 15:20:54
I've contributed to this number and don't plan on stopping. Thank you CheapAir!

I like it. We are looking for a formal name, so call it Nakamoto... 
1 bitcoin = 1000000 Nakamotos
1 Nakamoto = 100 Satoshis
People can short hand and slang the words however they like.
@_date: 2018-05-25 23:03:10
Sorry, I'm not talking about bitcoin magazine. I'm referring to yBitcoin
@_date: 2014-01-07 01:43:09
yes, I did.
@_date: 2014-05-29 01:40:42
Was just about to say the same thing. I check coinmap before all my travels. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 11:45:50
Awesome. 1 bitcoin = One million bits and zero satoshis. I really hope this change is made.
@_date: 2014-05-29 02:57:18
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:12:28
Did you figure this out? I was wondering the same thing for Charlotte, NC. 
@_date: 2014-02-05 01:20:20
It already has - it's known as government
@_date: 2014-05-25 22:59:40
Any thoughts to why there are 10 downvotes on this? 
@_date: 2014-08-25 01:29:36
Just donated. Is there anyway I can know what my donation gets used for? 
@_date: 2014-07-16 22:59:33
Wow, thank you! Yes I also frequently use !m - google maps, !yt - youtube, and !wa - wolframalpha, !a - amazon. There are many more. 
You can also search programming documentation if you are a programmer like !php echo or !drupal Reddit OAuth

I have similar stories with some of my friends, but for most it's been pretty successful. If they take the time to really think about it, they will see all the amazing benefits it has over traditional money. For me it's not as much about how much I make (although thats a great perk)... its about the low transaction fee, the ability to send money overseas cheaply/quickly, not having to depend on a bank to use my money, being able to travel overseas without being robbed of my cash or credit cards, and the list goes on.
I explain these things to others as fact, not a sales pitch. I dont get upset if the choose not to accept bitcoin/ buy bitcoin. Honestly, I feel I am failing myself and my friends if I do not tell them about it. I want them to know about this because I care about them and I feel it can make their lives better. This goes for merchants as well. 
@_date: 2014-05-04 04:03:08
I like it, but how about just naming it formally as Nakamoto? People can short hand it however they like after.
@_date: 2014-07-27 13:28:26
Cool, i see it.
@_date: 2014-12-08 23:27:56
PACK! 1000 bits
@_date: 2014-09-10 14:25:54
Great site. Thanks for posting! 
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:15:12
The list of states in this post does not seem to be consistent with the one on your website. 
Which one is accurate? 
@_date: 2015-05-20 14:13:43
hey, i know that guy!
@_date: 2014-09-12 18:47:52
I agree, great page. Replaced several of my bookmarks as well. There were a few though that I sent in that  hope he updates the page with. I sent an email to him on his page but no additions of the links yet :( 
@_date: 2014-01-21 16:12:47
Me too! See you soon.
@_date: 2014-06-26 13:56:01
Was there a follow up to this post? Photo? Newspaper article? 
@_date: 2015-05-22 13:18:21

I believe you can sign up on coinbase.com and get a couple tenths of a bitcoin too!
@_date: 2015-04-04 01:56:51
Maybe represents some sort of brain wallet seed?

Yep, I did mine while I was at the register and it was pretty fast.. Only problem I had is that gyft only let me buy $500 per gift card. So I had to buy a few to completely pay for my patio furniture :) 
@_date: 2013-08-17 15:24:53
I've used gyfts mobile interface and it is amazingly easy to use. I now have new furniture paid with bitcoin thanks to gyft.

Thank you for the post and sorry for the nightmare.. I have now enabled two factor authentication on my blockchain.info account. 
@_date: 2013-03-05 05:57:26
Same here. I recently switched all of my domains over from godaddy to namecheap. Wow am I happy I made the switch and even more so now. Go bitty go!
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:06:09
If you are thinking about paying taxes on bitcoin go ahead and take a listen to this:  ... specifically the last segment.
