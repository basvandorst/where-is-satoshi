Well as posted in the link, it was a driver issue. Updated to Catalyst 11.5 and problems went away. Only thing remains is that one core gets 83Mhash/sec while other gets 55Mhash/sec, any ideas on the big difference?

That would be helpful. When I get home tonight I'll update all my drivers and test again, perhaps with other miners. Which do you use?

Built this over the weekend to make it easier to see what my mined coins were worth. Added BTC Guild, deepbit, slush, and BTC Mine. 
Todo list includes
* Build FireFox version
* Add BitcoinPool
* Add MtRed (had problems connecting my miners to it last time I tried, could be delayed)
* Possibly add mybitcoin or other sites like it.
Donations welcome

Posted the question on the bitcoin forums, but hoping to get some input from the reddit crowd.

This is not a miner, just changes the way the pool website looks by adding  BTC in USD value where ever you have a balance shown. There are some screenshot's on the extension page that shows what I mean.

Here's a [link]( to a second post I made directly about this issue. 
Tried changing core clock settings in MSI Afterburner and CCC to no avail. Ended up trying same thing with RivaTuner and it finally worked. 
Both cores are running at 800Mhz core clock and 450Mhz memory clock churning out 88Mhash/sec. Only down side is that temps are hovering around 96-98 degrees, so I'll probably bring the core clock speeds down to 700 or 750.
Hope this helps.
