20 bitcoins in 24 hours really isn't that much compared to the block reward over that time period. So even for miners it barely makes any difference at all.

Yes, it might scare off a handful of new users who don't know what's going on. Maybe. Maybe not. And this is something worthwhile how exactly?
The scaling issue is well known already. And solutions are being discussed and worked on. There is no need to spam the network for 24 hours just to make a point that everyone is already well aware of.

Why create a false sense of urgency? Either it's urgent or it's not urgent. I think the discussion about the urgency of this issue is well under way regardless of this spamming effort.

Isn't every bitcoin transaction part of a chain? What's the reason for excluding the ones that are part of a chain longer than 100??

How exactly would Bitcoin not survive this spamming effort? All it does is increase the necessary fees to get a transaction included in the next block for a little while. Nothing is going to break or whatever. It's just temporarily going to be slightly more expensive to send bitcoins around. And then it's back to normal and someone has wasted 20 BTC. 
This really is pointless. It's nothing but spamming useless transactions, and it should be treated as such.

Yes true. But as I said, the effect of this flooding is only that it increases the required fees for a while. It's a slight inconvenience for those who know to add higher fees, and it's a bigger inconvenience for those who don't know what's going on and wonder why their transaction don't confirm anymore all of a sudden. That's all there is to it. So why even bother with something like that?

This is not mandatory however. And most people never bother to set it up.

It's not a debate, it's just a correction.

$2 and $10 is a 500% increase! That's hardly staying the same.
@_date: 2015-01-03 19:07:45
All I did was point out that a $2-$10 range is not equal to "the price staying the same". That's like a price range of $200-$1000. That's all I really wanted to point out, nothing more.

I've donated to the pot twice before I realized that automated scripts like this exist, and I don't even play the game. Now I'm not donating any more.
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:58:01
What? You said it stayed at $2 for two years, which is not true. Then you said that you meant to say that it stayed in a range of $2-$10. That is not "the same", it's a 500% swing. And what exactly do you want to talk about?
@_date: 2016-01-30 17:04:23
But price was lower then too, so a higher fee in bitcoin was still a lower fee in usd.
@_date: 2016-01-30 17:08:15
I don't think he was talking about the supply of coins, but the supply of blockchain space for transactions. Did you not get this or do you not want to get this?

Is this from the second airdrop? Is Auroracoin even a thing in Iceland or has it completely failed so far?
@_date: 2016-01-30 17:13:11
Let's not kid ourselves here: Bitcoin could not handle any kind of mainstream adoption right now, not even from a fantasy football site. That's the sad reality of things.

Good article. But, alas, it also ends up focusing on how blockchain technology is supposed to make everything better somehow, and only mentions bitcoin as the best known example of this blockchain technology.

What would make Zerocash different from all the other privacy altcoins? It's not like there's a shortage of such projects.
