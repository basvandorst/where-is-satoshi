Easy there, you realize that from 11k to 12k is only a 9% gain? 1k moves aren’t that special anymore 
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:04:32
Hahah so many of you guys are fucked in the future. All those gainz sweeped away by a tax penalty 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:55:03
Haha hey don't just go with what I say, read up on it and make the decision for yourself. But in my honest opinion, I think it has a purpose in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:24:35
Nope, monero is taking the place of what bitcoin once was.
Don’t get me wrong btc’s strides have been unbelievable, but it’s upside is a lot more capped than it used to be. Unless mass adoption happens, it’s just a collectible atm.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:06:44
You can only do that if those transactions occurred in the same year, other than that you still need to pay tax on the 5k gains
@_date: 2017-12-01 11:49:21
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:16:47
meh xmr just went up 120% in two days
@_date: 2017-08-05 13:31:12
Sell and buy back at the dip 
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:16:04
Except that most kids here still live at home and don’t use “their” money at all
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:49:28
Lmao easy there kid
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:08:23
Why would you post this lol wouldn’t be surprised to see your hard drive hacked in the next day or two
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:16:52
....good one?
@_date: 2017-09-16 21:49:42
Thank you. The dorks of this sub are unreal
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:31:30
Too much info man, just be like everyone else and tell me to stfu or something haha
@_date: 2017-09-04 00:04:55
Not at all, the way bitcoins blockchain tech is set up will cause fees to just keep rising, eventually to outrageous prices. Not beneficial at all in the long run. Hell, bitcoin cash blows it out of the water 
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:00:01
You must be like 12
@_date: 2017-09-03 23:05:36
That's why other alts are becoming the coin of choice. Btc just has popularity behind it, that's it 
@_date: 2017-09-04 00:00:52
I'm no crypto analyst so I'm not going to give you that advice, however there are a ton of others besides the 3 you listed. Out of those 3 I'd choose ethereum for sure because it has investors/partnered with blue chip stocks such as Microsoft 
@_date: 2017-09-24 22:33:15
R/amiugly hahahahahahaha
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:10:19
Because I liked to keep up with news surrounding an extremely volatile investment, but I quickly found out how dorky/culty this sub is 
@_date: 2017-09-24 21:03:55
Or 999 for bills and rent....o wait, 99% of this sub still lives with their parents ahhaaha 
@_date: 2017-09-03 15:10:25
Doesn't make sense, most of these coins have increased almost 10 fold in value during that time period. I call bs unless you literally bought at the peaks at every single coin and sold the second the took a dip 
@_date: 2017-09-13 00:54:44
Haha how many of you skinny fucks are shitting your pants bc your whole allowances have been blown on btc which is shitting the drain???
@_date: 2017-09-13 18:54:58
Um give me your flawed money then 
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:48:03
Might as well of read "vagina repellent"
@_date: 2017-09-25 21:12:16
If you need assistance from family, you should be paying them back when you can in return for giving you a home....not spending 1k on crypto. That's incredibly immature and moronic.
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:41:10
OP get a life 
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:10:59
Eh I'll stick to attractive girls, but thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:51:08
Except that people buying bitcoin are the impatient-wannagetrichovernight kind lol
@_date: 2017-09-03 23:04:44
Oh you know? Please tell me how it's going to be 12 years from now 
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:51:15
It is though lol fucking fanboys these days...
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:48:08
Shut up
@_date: 2017-09-09 12:37:28
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:46:19
Posts like this make me want to hate bitcoin. Some of you fanboys are brutal 
@_date: 2017-10-28 15:07:54
Most of these kids still live at home so they aren’t paying the power bill.
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:58:00
People said that at 4500
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:56:39
Gay af
@_date: 2017-09-25 22:52:56
Wut? Good luck with finding a girl who wants to move in with your parents. Or is r/bitcoin just asexual 
@_date: 2017-09-16 21:45:12
Can you elaborate on what happened on the trading floor that was so immoral? Would love to hear some stories!
@_date: 2017-09-13 03:59:43
Lmaoooo did he really say take out the market cap? Jesus Christ 
@_date: 2017-09-25 21:14:03
I prefer realist but I'll take it 
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:17:03
I'd take it with a grain of salt when someone here claims they made millions from bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:26:21
Lmaooooooo yeah right, get your head out of your ass
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:44:49
Doubt anyone who has made it big from bitcoins is on this sub interacting with a bunch of teenagers who think they're gonna get rich from buying .05 of a bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:29:56
Some of you people treat bitcoin like it is a security...
@_date: 2017-07-16 15:00:49
That fucking blows for you
@_date: 2017-07-30 19:47:40
Yeah and maybe one day my dong will be between the cheeks of Emily Ratajkowski
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:21:07
Ha you're stupid af
Edit: I'm actually insulting stupid people by calling you stupid. Idk if there's a word to describe you in the English language 
@_date: 2017-07-30 12:08:47
Except no one in this sub is rich from bitcoins 
@_date: 2017-07-30 22:26:09
Wow knew about bitcoin that early and made no moves? Man you missed your chance. No way in hell another 800% gain is coming 
@_date: 2017-07-16 15:01:07
@_date: 2017-06-28 01:38:10
Oh god, are you actually serious? I feel bad for this whole sub 
@_date: 2017-06-28 02:40:33
@_date: 2017-06-28 02:07:36
Prove it 
@_date: 2017-06-28 02:38:39
You just quoted two things from at least 30 years or older....totally valid though /s
@_date: 2017-06-27 03:22:29
Jesus, so much shitting on crypto other than bitcoin....slowly hoping ether takes over just to shut some people up lol
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:00:11
This just makes ethereum more appealing lol
@_date: 2017-06-28 03:50:49
Lmao so the federal reserve is run by the banks but it also controls all banks? Did you even read what you wrote?
@_date: 2017-06-28 02:46:28
Hey man, if you're a true believe that finance doesn't change than go ahead and believe that bull. I prefer to stick with the times 
@_date: 2017-06-27 03:23:37
Lol good luck with having to pay court and lawyer fees
@_date: 2017-06-28 01:39:03
Ok then what are you talking about? Be specific, how is money in banks created out of thin air without government approval 
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:59:05
Well I mean it's r/bitcoin, biases are going to be made towards btc 
@_date: 2017-06-27 03:24:24
@_date: 2017-06-27 20:03:22
Money cannot be created in out of thin air in banks lol it's not like a teller can just accidentally hit a 0 next to someone's checking account and now they have more money...
