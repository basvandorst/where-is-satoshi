Sure, but that's not the intention. It's the reason so many compare it to the start of the internet. So much work involved to do something that's now so simple.

Do you hold BTC? What would you sell at if you wanted to convert everything to fiat?
@_date: 2014-01-29 16:12:41
You can send money over the internet to anyone very easily. How is that not an advantage? So much of our lives happen online these days.

So will they actually own BTC? As in the same way people own it now with a public/private key? Or do they just own a different representation of it and the ETF actually holds the coins?

Really? I feel like there would be a lot of buyers well before 250...

thanks for the totally not sarcastic comment

Watching this thread closely.
The last post in that thread is of a public address with 15BTC asking the dude to hack it. If he delivers, this is the end of bitcoin.

totally got all that

Net worth could even be "a cheese pizza". As long as there is something to your name you have net worth.

what do you mean?

Seems low to me... Only a 2x increase?

The investors wont actually hold BTC if I understand correctly so they're not transferring anything.
@_date: 2014-01-29 01:33:40
it's not true.

CNN: Hackers have cracked the bitcoin algorithm. Can steal bitcoins from any public address.

So is it creating it's own eco system of supply and demand breaking down each bitcoin further as more people invest or does the ETF keep acquiring more BTC as more people buy shares? In other words does the amount of BTC in the ETF change or does it start at say 20,000BTCs and stay there?

interesting. sounds promising.
@_date: 2014-01-30 16:41:32
Love it. I just put it in my post.
@_date: 2014-01-28 22:52:22
So you think the price as it stands is overhyped?
@_date: 2014-01-28 22:51:25
does catcoin really exist?
@_date: 2014-01-28 22:53:45
Good call. As long as we get enough merchant adoption, I think I'd spend mine too. I think a lot of people want to take their profits and run to a safe harbor from the swings. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 22:49:13
Fun to think about at least. Another 10x increase.
