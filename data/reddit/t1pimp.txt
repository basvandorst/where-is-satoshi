The same 50 Cent that claimed to have made $8 million in Bitcoin but ultimately admitted in the bankruptcy documents that he has never owned Bitcoin?
*MAYBE* they should rethink their marketing strategy?!
@_date: 2018-09-21 04:08:51
That comment was more about claiming to have Bitcoin and having to admit to NOT holding any than about bankruptcy. Having said that, even if you take the bankruptcy angle it's shit marketing for any ATM. An intelligent consumer would have to wonder if they'll get their cash or if it'd bitch out, say 'ooops', not give you your money, and then pretend that was a baller move all while singing it's getting hot in here. *rolling eyes*

Cryptographic proof is used to enforce possession in bitcoin. Only someone with knowledge of the private key can spend a coin. People in an ETF won't have a key. I fully get where some would find it attractive and people can do whatever they want. But part of what makes Bitcoin such a fundamental shift is that it eschews the centralized gatekeepers of traditional monetary systems (banks and governments). All an ETF does is put more into the hands of the banks. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 02:46:58

LOL. Seems like you don't understand Bitcoin at all. It's code. It's programmable money. But it's also open... so anyone can look at the code and know that code will execute exactly as specified. So you could send to an address for zombie hitler... but it's not like zombie hitler could swoop in and steal all the BTC in the world. That's not how it works.

Yup. Also... The Old Testament also gave instructions on how to treat your slaves.   
Go read Genesis 1 though... that is always what floors me about Christians, particularly those who want to claim it as the literal word... We know the Earth was not here before light. Sure, if we want to we could argue that the heavens and Earth were abstract ideas and not fully formed and that the light was that of the first photon at the beginning of the universe. But if we read just a bit further, the first day is created, the first morning and night is created, and THEN the 'lights in the vault of the sky to separate the day from the night'. So you can't get out of the intro without it being factually inaccurate!

Not having to dick around with shuffling apps. The S holds 2-3 tops. There's also a shelf life on how long companies will continue to support older hardware to be considered... Though I don't know that their Blue ever took off, which was the concern I initially had - that the Blue and X would relegate the S to the dustbin - but that doesn't appear to be the case.

If you debate Ledger Nano S or X go for the X if you plan on holding anything other than Bitcoin. The S can hold all your keys but it's very limited in space so the apps to interact when them it can only hold maybe 2-3 at a time (you can delete them and retain your crypto but you have to install and uninstall and install etc to interact with them). I've installed so many apps on the X I don't even know what the limit is it's that many.

I just don't want to get lumped in, via a term, with all of them! ;)  I've never really given much thought to a term or how to self-reference around this space.

It's not going to be just money. Again, think longer term. Let's say there are 40 cryptos, the rest burn down, but atomic swaps are enabled on all of them. BTC might be the ultimate settlement ledger but LTC could be for payments, RVN for assets, etc etc but they all use BTC as the final settlement ledger (because it's proof of work security is so strong). That's just one example frankly. And it might not even be Bitcoin that remains king (though it's security of it's ledger makes it very attractive). If you've not yet, check out Nano. It's unique and super cool tech (also blindingly fast). Also... Read up on mimblewimble (which curiously was also anonymously dropped in crypto forums and nobody knows who the author is).

I get it. You're butt hurt you lost money. Not all of us have. Institutional money is working it's way in. The average consumer isn't even the target demographic yet.

FWIW fiat switches from one dominant to another in a cyclical manner and we're WELL OVERDUE for this to take place again. At this point, you can either place your bet in Chinese currency or BTC but the day of USD being the peg is nearing it's end.

So.... r/Bitcoin is mooning?

Ok now make one with BTC-SV but with Tom from MySpace.

\^ this. If BCH is so great then BTC will go away and nobody will care if it's called bcash or Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash. They'll just use it. It's their obsession with the name and shady tactics using the [bitcoin.com]( domain that drives me nuts.

There are literally 'bot' trading groups that do this and coordinate via chat rooms. So cryptoDudeA's group can signal to CryptoDudeB's group and then they tell their bots what to do and say, "Now". If you watch the alt markets it's blatantly obvious sometimes when pump'n'dumps are going on.   
I've played with several trading bots. There's nothing stopping me from buying 200 of them and coordinating with several people to influence the price of something.

Not true. If that were the case then the first high-frequency trading algorithms would have owned the entire stock market.   


These groups are tiered like an MLM. So there will be a chat room where a small consortium of people decide what they're going to pump. Each controls a larger group one tier down. Major players in those groups control even larger subgroups. And so on. The first group decides what to pump and signal to the "special 2nd tier" group. Buying starts and price goes up. The 2nd tier then sends their signals to the 3rd group and then even more people are buying... and this just continues. The price starts to climb much faster now as FOMO sets in and even people not aligned with these chat groups want to get in on the action. Once it gets to the price the 1st tier wanted they sell and tell tier 2 to sell. It's topped out and then trickles down to subgroups. The people not aligned with any group are left with the worst positions while the higher up in the groups you are the most you made by selling at the top.

On the flip side wash trading is, currently, ok for crypto so you can intentionally take a loss and immediately buy it back at the same price point. So say you bought at $10,000 and are hodling. Sell it and immediately buy it back. You've just provided yourself with instant tax relief and still retained the asset for the same (or mostly same depending on daily volatility)  price.

Agreed. But if this guy didn't comprehend a market order he should have paid someone to manage his funds. It's still not, in any way, the fault of the exchange. 
I offer discounts if people pay me in crypto. It's at the bottom of every invoice. For those willing I can, and do,  transact in crypto. I've happily made purchases in crypto too. And that's all fine in a non-fiat system. If you want fiat then you need to take a class or pay someone to manage it for you... But you really don't have a thing to stand on if you transfer a bunch of money and then execute a trade and then go, "ooops! My bad. Can I have a do over?" Cuz the answer is and should be... No. If you give me your address and I send 1BTC instead of .01BTC then unless you choose to send it back that's on me and it shouldn't be mutable.

I didn't mean actual wash-trading (illegal). But yes... you can sell and buy back (just not from yourself a la wash trade) and take the tax loss while still buying back at (approx) the same amount. At least if you're doing FIFO accounting.

ShapeShift has KYC/AML now. Most BTMs require the same these days (at least in the US). Localbitcoin is still viable but sounds like more of a pain to me.

Dude this is crazy slick. Nicely done!
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:19:13
Already did! Keep up the good work.

This should be standard practice... but uh... if everyone does it on Jan 3 won't tx fees go thru the roof?!

You still could if you held your own keys. That's not what happened in this instance. It was on the exchange. I think the point is that to withdraw that volume from an exchange they should require some additional authentication. Otherwise, hold it in your wallet and then you can move however many millions you want whenever you want.
