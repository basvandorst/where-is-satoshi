Thanks I'll try that.  I'd rather not have my transaction details tied to even my reddit account.
UPDATE: 
Well that just completed.  Now my transaction is Completed, but still only seen by 1 peer.
Is there anything to worry about if its only seen by 1 peer?

How about allowing federal taxes/income taxes to be paid using Bitcoin
EDIT: To those that didn't listen to the video my comment is referring to the question in the Title, the Senator asks what the government can to help this innovative technology

Thanks for the tip!  I don't see that option in the menus, or anything.  Do you know how I do that?

Thank you

Yes, everything looks good.
Thanks so much for the help and information!!
@_date: 2014-08-25 09:02:45
Thanks for that.  Unfortunately it looks like that tool to rebroadcast transactions is down.  I get an http 500 error page when I paste the hex code of my transaction in there and click the button.
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:34:08
Thanks! That worked for me also.

I want to us Bitcoin to transfer some USD to British Pounds.  I have a US bank account tied to Dwolla and MtGox.  Will I be able to buy bitcoins and then send them somewhere to convert to Pounds?
If anyone knows how to do this, what would be the best way?
@_date: 2013-03-12 01:29:32

@_date: 2013-10-03 15:52:58
Thanks a lot!  That's really good to know.  
I think that might be the route I take also.  Im in no hurry thought so for now I think Im just going to try to buy low and transfer.  I got some coins yesterday :)

They are completely different platforms of development.  Generally it is done in one stack or the other, but not everything combined.  It makes it simpler on the architechture and development if the technologies will communicate natively with each other.
**EDIT: A stack is a set of tools to run your software on. Eg. for .NET: Windows Server for hosting IIS(msft web server), and a SQL database.  Using C# for development of the webpages, and WCF for sending data back and forth from client to server.  The .NET(microsoft) suite has all the technologies you will need to deliver the information to the client, without having to use linus/php/python..etc.  So you pick one or the other to start something new.

I have family in the UK.  Would that work?  
Im looking at MtGox right now and in the Withdrawal options I see a statement about SEPA and it taking 2 weeks.  But I don't see the option to see one up.  Im not very familiar with that.  Is setup just by adding a funding option to a EU(UK?) bank transfer(IBAN,SWIFT/BIC,ABA)?
Thanks for any help.  Im not experienced with this.

Why is someone in Germany limited to 100E per transaction?  I thought they only put restrictions on Cypriot banks, not German(or all of EU)???
@_date: 2013-09-29 21:22:10
That many options eh?
@_date: 2013-09-30 07:00:35
It wasn't really a risk when I started.  Im not very active in there.  I made an investment a while ago, when Dwolla worked just fine.
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:29:05
hhahahha....I feel stupid.  Never noticed.  Thanks for letting me know.
@_date: 2013-11-14 13:45:03
Thanks - Ill look into that.
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:18:32
Thanks, glad to hear it for you!
Hopefully mine will come soon.  That was all of my BTC in Gox...NEVER AGAIN!
