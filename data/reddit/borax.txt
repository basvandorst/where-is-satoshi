I get that this is annoying for those of us already using SegWit (it was annoying that I had  to update and post this), but this is a critical upgrade to counter some of the (quite frankly very reasonable) criticism that bitcoin is currently getting due to the crazy transaction fees and backlog.

Bitcoin is in a short term bubble and you are guaranteed to lose money in the short term. In ten years time, you could be a  millionaire, but in one year, you are going to be hurting. 100%  assets in Bitcoin is a dreadful idea. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:47:50
Done. I made some token updates but it didn't take long to realise how much work went into the original.
It could be cool to keep the "Smaller exchanges which have implemented Segwit" as a reward for implementing it, and I also think "ready" is not worth having in the table. If it's ready, they should implement it.

I agree, most people find the technology that underlies bitcoin and many other financial topics boring, however, as this subreddit is dedicated to Bitcoin discussion, I feel that the technology behind it and the possibility of the user experience is relevant.

Why shouldn't you?
This isn't a problem with bitcoin itself, but with a company related to it. You could ask the same of the USD after the 2007 banking crisis.
Unfortunately it was a big player in the market but there were cries to drop support of MtGox for a long time before this happened.
There are plenty of audited, open source storage solutions which make an event like this impossible. Blockchain offers such a service in-browser, while local clients eliminate a third party altogether.

I get this simple explanation thoroughly but unfortunately I want to understand it better than this.
@_date: 2014-03-20 19:31:40
Ok, I'm getting there.
1. I do m^e and this gives a "signature" mathematically related to the message. 
2. There is a publicly available list of the ways which a signature must relate to a message. These modulo functions could give the same answer for multiple m^e combinations.
3. I send this signature with the message.
2. The receiver can use the modulo functions to give an output of my public key. If they can, the message is determined as genuine.
Theoretically an alternative value for e could be found that gave the same modulus answer (public key) when run by the public rules, but the computing power required to achieve this is not possible with current technology.
Sound right?

@_date: 2014-03-20 18:30:30
Which letter is which key?
What I don't understand is how someone with only a public key can verify a signature.
Surely they need to know the formula used to generate the signature from the public key to be certain that the two are correctly linked?

I think you've done it!
So when signing a message with RSA:
I use the private key to generate a "modulus" for the message.
The reader can use the "modulus" to generate my public key, but could never use the public key to generate the same "modulus" because only the private key can create *a* modulus which *also* **re**generates the public key when compared to the message.

Why can this be done with a different function to the first? Surely the "other function" needs to be the private key, otherwise you have an equation with multiple correct answers, and if you can use any formula to generate a correct answer, that's as good as a private key?

I think of all the businesses vulnerable to the feds and therefore right to refuse dealing with the recreational cannabis industry, bitpay is high on the list. They are already upsetting a lot of people, they do not want to give an excuse to their detractors to shut them down.
This is exactly why drug laws are such a superb oppressive tool. They allow easy targeting of those who breach societal norms and would-be dissenters because such people do not mind breaking a relatively victimless law.

Why get rid of the unit "bitcoin"? If the aim is just to take it out of common use then at least use microbits?

There is always this fallacy that it's possible to buy at the bottom and sell at the top. In reality, humans are human and the VAST majority will panic halfway up and sell, or hold on too long and sell 2 weeks later.
Then at the other end there are all the people thinking "it's surely going to go down again, I'll buy in the next dip" and before they know it, it's risen another 50%.
So I suspect that the number of secret millionaires from bitcoin is a lot lower than it seems. That doesn't mean that a lot of people didn't get a bump for their pension, or a new car or something but it's unlikely to be retirement money for any except a very slim few.

The bitcoin code only allows 1mb of data to be transmitted through the network every 10 minutes (each "block" is 1mb of transaction information). Most people believe this is too small for 2017 but the programmers who have the most power don't agree so they won't raise it. 
A lot of people think this is because the main programmers want their sub-network to be successful but for it to get popular, bitcoin needs to be struggling.

They built the roads you drive on, the stable economy that let your dollar buy bitcoin, the stable political system which meant that looters or soldiers don't burn your house down tomorrow, and the police service that protects you from the real theives.
Nobody likes paying taxes but wealthy people benefit from the outcome of doing so in a huge way. With no rule of law you'd have been stupid to even post this here because the incentive to kill you for your money would far outweigh the disincentive.
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:06:37
Right, but as the price of a bitcoin increases, the breakeven energy cost per coin mined becomes less significant. So energy costs can increase and we get into a situation where it's possible to justify huge energy use to mine a block, no? 
The efficiency per transaction would have to improve by at least an order of magnitude on its current value to be remotely green.

That's not how CGT works - you pay tax on the change in value (assuming it's  a profit) between the time that your received the gift and the time that you made the "Chargeable Disposal".
In OP's case, buying the BTC, sending it and then cashing it out would struggle to give time for more than a few % change in value, meaning the profit would be under the £11700 limit you mention.

I think a balance of UBI and money creation for infrastructure spending makes the most sense, rather than one or the other. UBI benefits everyone equally but raising the minimum infrastructure standard will disproportionately benefit those in poverty or with less money, therefore requiring less total money creation.

Every 10 minutes, transactions are bundled into a "block" as the final step of their verification. Only a certain amount of transactions can fit into this block, and currently almost all the blocks are full, which means that extras are bumped to be delayed by (an extra) 10 minutes. 
If there are multiple full blocks in a row it can result in a backlog of delayed transactions. 
The bitcoin protocol developers have refused to increase the size of these blocks because they are worried that it will mean only computers with high speed connections could mine bitcoin, but opponents are concerned that won't matter if we get much fuller because people won't be able to send transactions anyway.

What the developers want is for bitcoin to not be a currency but to be  something that's used to store value.
This is completely different to what bitcoin was being promoted as 3 years ago but the developers want this. That's why they villified those supporting a blocksize increase, that's why they don't want anything that increases capacity.

Yes, forex gains are liable for capital gains tax. If people think they won't get caught then they won't declare it but if they are trading through an exchange then there is a record of their trades. 
Governments know this is happening and in a decade's time when cryptocurrencies are well established, all they have to do is subopoena the exchanges, trace the transactions and apply punitive tax charges to all the people who have 10x'd their original investments but not paid tax on trading activity. 
One more reason to hodl - you don't owe a penny in tax if you don't make any transactions.

Haven't watched the video but usually these hacks rely on at least having physical access, and often they need you to unlock a modified device before they have access.
So it's still SO, so so much better than just storing it on a PC but you can't rely on them as your only security.

coinbase text? As a lay person, I don't have an intimate knowledge of alternative keywords to search for, and I don't use coinbase. I searched on google to try and find what support it had but couldn't find any resources. 
This is not a matter of not searching, it's a matter of not knowing what to search for. That is the exact reason that we cite claims, to demonstrate that we are not obfuscating or manipulating the truth.

Yes precisely, that would be a 1:9 leverage ratio - they could allow withdrawal of up to 10% of funds but the other 90% is tied up in investments.

Here's something interesting, either freedata.io has become suddenly quite popular on reddit in the last couple of months, or they've been very cleverly using reddit to market.
I mean seriously clever, because it's always only brought up in an edit to a post, and usually in a link to another subreddit. 
That one is a good example. A tempting comment then a short time later you've added a link to a tiny subreddit with a 3 month old mod account. 
Honestly it might just be guerilla marketing for a good product, or organic marketing for a good product, in which case more power to them, but do read the small print in case it's not legit.

@_date: 2013-12-30 13:02:36
I think the word you are looking for is correct rather than crash.
A correction suggests that the price changed from a previously realistic value following new information.
A crash follows a bubble, where the peak price was not realistic and the new price was the only realistic one all along.
A crash can't really be caused by an overreaction because the price was unstable all along.
In the short term, we had a bubble and it crashed because the economy had not grown to support the value.

We get trapped in a cycle. Ignorance leads to fear, fear leads to exclusion and exclusion prevents us from understanding, which makes us ignorant.
Many people struggle to break this. They do not want to leave their comfort zone. They cannot break the link between ignorance and fear. They never have access to another perspective.
It is a great shame but it is part of human nature, and most people are ignorant of it. That leads to fear....

Surely the issue here is precisely that these stolen bitcoins *are* centralised.
The unfortunate fact of the matter is that humans are selfish and cannot be trusted.
Because the market is totally unregulated and poorly understood by authorities there is little framework to prosecute those who steal bitcoins.
Until that framework exists it seems that the answer is "trust no-one". I would have a hard time trusting anyone with £1000 in cash if I had never met them and they could steal it without repurcussion and I have the same dilemma with bitcoin. I just wish paper wallets weren't so flammable.
