It depends on their country. In Islam, as with early Christianity, it's *compound* interest that's illegal. A compliant loan has a fixed fee, it never compounds, but failing to pay it back can be punished severely.
There are also other creative interpretations of Sharia law with "lease-to-own" arrangements, though [some have argued these are an even bigger racket]( than traditional loans.

Take away oil and America would still be stuck in the 19th century burning coal for everything.
Algeria, Libya and even Morocco were far ahead of America until modern industrialization kicked in. One could even argue that without the Civil War to give America a kick in the ass, militarily America was a bunch of hillbillies with guns that once tried and failed to conquer Canada.
Modern, dominant American only came about leading into World War I when they suddenly had the power and influence to take a place on the world stage. After the war, when most of their challengers were in ruins, there wasn't much in the way of displacing Britain as a superpower.

Public/private key encryption is the basis here, ECDSA as used by Bitcoin, like RSA, is for encryption and decryption. Encryption allows you encode something and later decode it, or verify that it was encoded using a particular key.
The transactions themselves are largely based on SHA256, a hashing algorithm. Hashing is generally not reversible by design.
The private keys are not hashed. That would render them useless. They're used for encryption. That's their only function. Otherwise you could just use a non-shared secret.
@_date: 2015-12-20 22:41:33
The cryptographic export ban, which I specifically linked to, greatly restricted the strength of encryption allowed and made public/private key signing activities of dubious value when using weakened encryption. It didn't matter what the encryption was used for, only that it was used at all, even to the point of it being illegal to include in the source code.
The ban was a misguided effort to prevent countries like North Korea and Iran from getting their hands on "strong encryption" when really all it did was massively complicate software projects that used any form of encryption.
There is no over-the-wire encryption, obviously, but there is encryption involved in the process. When you talk about "banning encryption" it bans it in **all forms**, not just over the wire. Public/private key signing would be impossible without encryption. Securing your wallet file would be impossible without encryption.
E-commerce, as we know it now, in all forms, Bitcoin included, would be completely destroyed without strong encryption.
This is why fighting against encryption or cryptographic bans is extremely important to everyone, Bitcoin included. It seems like everyone here is cracking out popcorn because, in their minds, Bitcoin wouldn't be affected.

You, and everyone else apparently, is missing the point that public/private key systems work because of, and only because of, encryption. **They do not hash.** The result of their operations can, of course, be used in hashes, as can any data. This is in the documentation where [ECDSA keys are discussed at length]( These are *encryption keys*. They are used to *encrypt and decrypt things*. Without the private key you cannot spend Bitcoin because you cannot prove you own it. You prove you own it using encryption to produce a proof that can be verified with the public key and another round of encryption.
You're confusing the hashing that goes into verifying a mining solution with the encryption that goes on to perform any signing operation. A Bitcoin hash solution is ultimately just a number, not an encryption key.
When you sign something, you employ encryption. When you verify the signature, you employ encryption. Without encryption public/private keys are just data.
Checking the signature is done by verifying that the party making the claim has the private key without having access to the private key. This is the basis of **asymmetric encryption**. This technology is the backbone of most major encryption technologies, like TLS as employed by HTTPS.

Bitcoin clients are open source, so yes, under the [cryptographic export ban]( that used to be in place, Bitcoin would have been classified as a munition because of **illegal encryption**. Most people have no idea how much bullshit that created for companies dealing with encryption in *any* form.
When they talk about "banning encryption" it's not just for over-the-wire stuff like most people here apparently are thinking. It's to try and put the genie back in the bottle, to ban it even more than it was ever banned before. The algorithms *themselves* were illegal. Bitcoin minus this code, or forced to use a flimsy, crackable version would **not work**.
I'm not arguing if making encryption illegal is a good idea, it's the stupidest idea ever to propose such a thing. All I'm saying is Bitcoin *absolutely* needs it to operate.
@_date: 2015-12-20 22:46:06
The only purpose a public and private key have are **for encryption**.
Do you know how you verify that a transaction was signed correctly?
**You encrypt using the public key** and verify that the results turned out as expected.
Of course the private key doesn't encrypt anything. It's the **decryption key**. This is cryptography 101.
If there was no public/private key component of Bitcoin, I would absolutely agree that encryption is not used. That is not the case. If you have public/private keys, by definition you are using encryption. **That is their singular purpose**.

Bandwidth between devices is always measured in bits.
Internally it's measured in bytes.
This is because traditionally very few computers used 8-bit bytes. There were all kinds of competing units, from 6-bit to 24-bit to crazy things like 15 every so often. It was only after the 1970s where the industry settled on 8-bit bytes as a good idea, but it was anyone's game leading up to that.
@_date: 2015-12-20 04:34:55
How can you state the textbook definition and still be totally stumped as to why **Bitcoin depends on encryption**?
If, in some hypothetical universe where encryption is banned, Bitcoin would subsequently become illegal.
Don't forget when this ridiculous discussion of banning encryption comes up, of reverting to a world like before the export ban on "strong crypto" was lifted, that it would include **both type 1 and 2 encryption**.
Your differentiation is utterly arbitrary, as if encryption is used on any data whatsoever it is by definition encryption. End of story. Does not matter if this data is ever transmitted anywhere.
In this fantasy land of some political people where nothing is strongly encrypted a system like Bitcoin would not work. Anyone with a sufficiently powerful computer could spoof your transactions or unlock your wallet and there's nothing you could do about it. In short, Bitcoin could never have succeeded if it were not for **strong encryption** being a component used to create the blockchain system.
Do you honestly think they'd let you get away with encrypting things like your hard drive or phone, or that your signing keys would be secure from government intrusion? They want that too.
@_date: 2015-12-20 00:04:47
There's an exceptionally blurry line between the two things. Any ban on encryption would, by definition, be a ban on cryptography.
I don't know what your point is of even bringing this up. Cryptographically secured transactions, such as Bitcoin, depend heavily on encryption. How else can you give away your public key without being exposed to attacks?
Oh, that's right. The **encryption key** is published, the decryption key is kept private.
@_date: 2015-12-20 09:53:19


This necessarily requires **asymmetric encryption** to achieve this. Just because the network traffic isn't encrypted doesn't mean encryption is not employed.
99.9999% of the stuff Bitcoin does is not encrypted, but there is a small but extremely important part that is. Without that layer of security it's utterly worthless. Anything can be spoofed.

Ironically, the network effect is the biggest threat to Bitcoin.
It's prominence has made it a target for miners, for companies producing mining hardware, and for thieves.
It's basically impossible for an individual miner to get in the market without a serious financial commitment. The days of inexpensive Bitcoin from mining on hardware you already had is over.
So you need to buy in via exchanges, yet these exchanges are always worrying, and the collapse of Mt. Gox, while necessary from an integrity standpoint, did a lot of damage. The bigger exchanges are, the more likely they are to fail because they become bigger targets, because their technical issues have bigger ramifications, and because scaling something like that is very hard.
The Bitcoin protocol has held up fairly well in the face of all this. What hasn't fared so well is the supporting infrastructure. Mining pools are the biggest threat to the integrity of Bitcoin today, the 51% problem is imminent and real without community intervention. It could end up a currency damaged beyond repair.
Once those problems are solved more effectively then cryptocurrency will be on a much more solid foundation. The problem is, because of the blockchain, Bitcoin's mistakes are permanent.

Hey, that bank bailout was bullshit, don't get me wrong, but it was bullshit created by deregulating that market, throwing Glass–Steagall, which had kept the banks from doing truly stupid things, in the trash.
Somehow those banks have paid off their emergency loans. One even did it early so they could give the executive staff their bonuses, as that sort of thing was prohibited so long as they had outstanding money owing.
Competition is great. Competition without regulation is a disaster, it's a game where the biggest cheater, the most aggressive player wins, every time.
You can have regulated competition as well. You can prevent banks from getting too big to have any competition, for example, prevent them from acquiring other large entities, or split them up into divisions which must then compete independently.

I realize how big the so-called "Internet of Things" is, and I'm also painfully aware of how miniscule the chips in some of these things are. The CPU and memory specs on some devices is so thin that running even the most stripped-down Linux would be insane, it's way too heavy. These things are barely even on most of the time, sort of in a near zero power coma, waking up to barf out a ZigBee packet once in a while if necessary.
You're talking about an **extremely** compute intensive operation. Let's presume these chips, through violating several laws of physics, have enough power for a single core to crunch away on hashes and enough network connectivity to be useful.
That's 100 million cores. Are they fast cores? Maybe 1GHz at best, like a smart phone, probably way less. Even at that ideal, they're still going to get **destroyed** by a modern mining rig. A GPU miner already thrashes a CPU miner to the point where it's not even worth turning CPU mining on, and GPU mining is so insignificant compared to ASIC mining that it's not even worth doing unless you're literally stealing time on someone else's machine.
Maybe if these guys are chip-design rockstars they can shim in a 1GHash/s chip, probably involving a pact with the devil. I'd be absolutely stunned if they could do more than 100KHash/s in an embedded environment.
That puts them at, presuming *all* devices are on and mining 100% of the time at peak performance: 100 million GH/s aggregate added to a pool operating at ~350 million GH/s current = 100 / 450 = 22%. With the more realistic level of performance it's 10/360 or 2.7%, but even that is *highly* unlikely despite being at least physically possible.
Keep in mind that 1GH/s of mining power nets about 1.6 cents per *week*. I have no idea where you're getting this $1 per month figure from. That's a chip capable of 13GH/s sustained. Not impossible, but the cheap chips turn out tons and tons of heat. Does [this]( look like something you can fit in "anything"?
This presumes the hashing power curve flattens off forever. Possible, but a risky bet. In a year it could easily be 600-800 on average if growth continues, diminishing their share even further. Considering that a year ago the hashing power was in the 80 range, it could be way, way higher. The [difficulty factor]( cannot be understated here.
Now obviously chips will get better, sure, but as those chips get better for this application in embedded devices, they will get even better for those that will run them at their maximum speed, heat be damned, so there's no net gain.
The entire idea is so flawed as to be ludicrous.

What bothers me about Bitcoin, or Reddit's take on it in particular, is that people worship at the altar if Bitcoin without questioning the underlying assumptions.
For every success, like HTTP, there are thousands of misguided failures each of which proves or disproves some kind of principle.
Bitcoin has proven that cryptocurrency can work, that's a huge achievement. What it hasn't proven is that it should be **the** cryptocurrency of the future.
This is just like how [BITNET]( proved email could work, but nobody even knows what that is now. It was later supplanted by another forgotten technology, UUCP, which was disrupted by SMTP, which itself was largely displaced by ESMTP.

The internet wasn't founded on the back of a cryptocurrency with a diminishing yield.
It was built by academic institutions with military funding and later, almost reluctantly, commercialized.
It's also worth noting that the internet was **immediately** embraced and grew at an exponential rate right out of the gate. The growth has not stopped. It's so out of control that they've run out of IPv4 numbers and have resorted to a form of cannibalism to keep the thing going.
Bitcoin was unabashedly commercial from the outset, and while it's gained a lot of traction, that's tapering off in a huge way now. Transaction volume is not going up as rapidly as it used to be. In fact, it looks like [linear growth]( at this point, at best.
If there's one thing that happens to things undergoing linear growth it's that they get crushed by those undergoing exponential growth. Every single time.

They weren't exactly wrong.
"Invention" is not so much a process of coming up with something out of thin air, but of incrementally improving on existing concepts.
The road from an electric fan to a microprocessor is filled with millions of tiny little improvements in a convoluted path, but it is a continuous chain of innovation.
For example, the Tesla, while a spectacular car, is fundamentally the same sort of thing that they were building a hundred years ago: An electric car. They didn't invent the electric car, but they did invent a whole lot of what goes into it, less fundamental but arguably much harder to develop technologies.
@_date: 2015-05-23 07:17:28
That's not how it works. The "proof-of-work" system is designed to be very hard, there's no short-cuts other than brute forcing it, which is exactly why the pro mining rigs are crazy expensive and run super hot.
They make anything less than that absolutely worthless. This hypothetical chip they're working on will probably be five or six orders of magnitude slower than a top-end mining rig for the simple reason that those high-end systems have several hundred of the latest chips running flat out to achieve that level of performance.
If your mining rig is too slow, it will never do any useful work. The overhead of running a pool for that many devices exceeds any profit that would ever be made.
This system would work a lot better if they simply had a pre-loaded amount of Bitcoin on the device that would periodically refresh from the source if necessary. Dumping a hundred Satoshis on the device is way cheaper than building something that *mine* in any useful capacity.

There will *never* be "billions" of miners. Even the most popular devices today are barely into the billions, cellular phones, but 80% of these have the compute power of a pocket calculator.
Bitcoin could be shut down in a weekend by any nation-state entity that cared to do it. It wouldn't even be hard to DDOS it: Everyone's address is freely advertised when you connect to the network.
The reason this hasn't happened is because there's no benefit to doing it and Bitcoin isn't enough of a threat to anyone. If it ever becomes disruptive enough, all it will take is something like what China did to GitHub to knock it over.

Secondly , if they had a hundred million devices in the wild, that would just ramp up the difficulty, and negate any profit they might've made not even factoring in how ridiculously diluted it's going to be.

Let's not forget that this whole time the American government was at war with various tribes, intent on exterminating them through any means possible.
Countries like Russia, India, and China have vastly more history and geopolitics significantly more complicated than what America had in the 20th century. They were fighting wars centuries before America was even a few squiggly marks on a map. In terms of history 1776 was basically yesterday. These countries have geopolitical problems that are older than that. Want to know why Ukraine is such a mess? You have to dig deep in your history textbook.
The single biggest factor in America's relative affluence is the ridiculous abundance of natural wealth where there was little to no opposition involved in taking them.

No, they'll turn off their gear and wait for conditions to improve. At any time they can spin it back up. Who says they have to "go out of business"? Maybe they have other sources of income, other crypto they can mine.
If 90% of the miners cut loose, that means someone who was previously only 20% of the pool is now 2x bigger than the *whole network* and could wreck it for everyone **at will**. This is the risk here.
Hypothetically if the miners actually go out of business where do you think their gear will go? Bought up at auction most likely. What if I could buy 51% worth of mining power at auction for a few hundred grand?

It's true. There was a time when anyone with a computer could mine a reasonable amount of Bitcoin, you just used your CPU. Then came GPU mining which was more of a commitment, but any gamer was already reasonably well prepared for. Then came ASIC mining which, at first, wasn't too expensive, you could buy a decent unit with Bitcoin after all.
Now we're at the stage where unless you have millions to dump into a Bitcoin mining datacenter you're left on the sidelines. Your $1000 ASIC miner probably won't break even before it becomes obsolete. It's more profitable to just buy Bitcoin directly.

This is a self-defeating argument. The more people can mine, the less Bitcoin each mining unit produces. If everyone has a thousand miners it just cranks up the difficulty into the stratosphere.
A device that pays for itself is a fairy tale. Even the best mining rigs have often only barely broken even due to manufacturing delays, cost of power, or other elements of friction in the system.
Some people got lucky early on during the wild price spike, but since then it's been much more mundane.

Right now the incentive for playing honestly is higher than playing dishonestly, but that could tip in the future. I'm not sure Bitcoin is intrinsically resistant to such things. We've seen what happens in other currencies when they get 51'd. It's not pretty.

Without the mining power the whole thing would collapse. All the nodes in the world won't prevent you from a 51% if interest wanes enough that some big miner decides to fuck it and hijack Bitcoin.

Deconstruct America: A middle class that's got a lot of opportunity to learn, to earn, and to invest. One that's backed up by easy access to credit.
Take out part of that and you have dysfunction. A poorly educated work force can't do skilled labor that pays better, you're a banana republic. Take out access to credit and you have smart people being held back who can't grow their business because they're starved for cash-flow, people who have to live in slums since they can't pay cash for housing. Take out good paying jobs and the market for services that cater to the general population dry up, making it harder to keep people employed.
As the traditional middle class is being ground away by a variety of factors, like the skyrocketing cost of education, of the cripplingly high cost of housing in some markets, of the lack of a well paying job even if you managed to sort out all that, you'll start to see severe economic problems set in.
Just imagine what America would look like if nothing had changed politically since the 1920s where working sixty hours a week in a dangerous coal mine for very little pay was considered good living, and all the industry titans were raking in billions of dollars on the backs of this labor and giving very little of that back.

Bitcoin as an experiment has been wildly successful. A ten minute delay in verifying payment is acceptable if you're considering it a proof-of-concept, but it's absurd when you're talking about wholesale replacing various currencies.
It needs to be quicker, response times under 30s, and it has to be able to handle megatransactions per second.
So figure out how much data you need to represent ~30-120MM transactions and that's your block-size. Make the mining intervals pay less, but happen more frequently. It's a huge change, but it's necessary.
If that sounds impossible consider how much data the Bittorrent network carries in aggregate, and how quick those nodes can be to supply data. It's sometimes faster to download from that network than from the official site, many Linux distributions offer Torrent options for this very reason.
Any crypto-currency that can offer that kind of scale will ultimately destroy Bitcoin if Bitcoin can't do that first.

Why? What value does Bitcoin as a currency have?
As far as I can tell it's based on trust, and when that trust is shattered, not just damaged as in the case of Mt. Gox, get ready for the bottom to fall out.
Bitcoin's technology is far more valuable than the Bitcoin currency.
@_date: 2016-11-14 04:11:58
No, it has value because of trust. That's always the case. Fiat or not.
If vendors lose faith in Bitcoin, if it suffers too much from infighting, from transaction time problems, from reliability, from any number of things independently or coincidentally, its value is impacted.
There's no government to back up Bitcoin should these things happen. There's no gold. There's *nothing*. There's no floor here, artificial or otherwise.

It's still not "seconds", most casinos need to review withdrawals very closely to be sure they're not getting taken. Once you cash out they have no recourse, so it can take time.
It can also land them in severe trouble if you're playing on American soil, so they'll need to verify where the money is going.
The "seconds" part is when they approve it and you get to take posession of the money, where in the case of Bitcoin it's about 600 of those.

This will be a transition far more difficult than vacuum tubes to transistors, at least those had a fairly straight-forward path. This is like one process to another far more exotic one that's only barely understood.
Moore's Law was an observation based on trends, so obviously it couldn't have happened before there was a trend. Sheesh.
Also people mistake Moore's Law for somehow being directly related to computing power. It isn't. It's related to *transistor count*, that's all. Normally more transistors means faster processing, but not always. Sometimes more transistors means less. It depends on how you use them.
There's other rules on the growth of compute performance vs. power required, or the efficiency of software over time that compound with Moore's law. Those haven't stopped.

Processor *frequencies* capped out about ten years ago, but they've done an enormous amount of work to make sure more gets done with each clock cycle.
A current day i7 at 4.0GHz absolutely destroys a Pentium 4 running at 4.0GHz. There's no comparison even on a core-to-core basis.
It used to be people would compare MHz to MHz since that often dictated speed, but even that was flawed. A 75MHz Pentium was considerably faster than a 50MHz 486 even though it was, on paper, only 50% faster. In practice, due to architectural changes, it was often at least double the speed, and for things like floating point, way more than that.

IBM has demonstrated a working 7nm process, though they've yet to achieve that in volume. There's a big difference between being able to fluke one out and being able to make millions of them.
Intel's having trouble with their 10nm process, but they're certain they can make it work. I suspect the biggest problem is yields, they're extremely driven to be first here, so if anyone cracks it they're bound to do it first.
That's a pretty good jump from 14nm, though from there the best they can theoretically hope for under ideal circumstances is 5nm.
Now remember this is feature pitch. There's nothing to prevent them from starting to push density higher by layering the chip.
Moore's law *only* relates to transistor count, not performance. The two are generally correlated, but it's not 1:1 by any means.
You can continue to increase the transistor count by increasing the layers in your chip, stacking wafer slices. Two layers equals doubled. Four layers quadrupled. There's reasonable limits to how much you can stack, but it's conceivable they could hit sixteen without any major re-engineering. The layers themselves are fractions of a millimeter thick.
That would just be a very fat chip indeed.

Nope. It's happened before to many countries, even some in recent history. The trust just shifts to other currencies.
By international monetary standards BTC is utterly irrelevant and always will be. It's not designed to scale that large, and honestly, given the amount of petty infighting over something as simple as opening up the block size, it's not something anyone in their right mind would put their trust in.
Is it an interesting experiment? A proof-of-concept that cryptocurrencies *can* work? Yes. 
Is it a platform that can hold any amount of value in a way that's trustworthy and secure? **Hell fucking no**.


Put down the Kool-Aid and listen to yourself here. The US government will never do this. Not with Bitcoin. No government with any credibility will ever do this. You might see some little country like Tuvalu do it as a publicity stunt, maybe put a couple of million in "currency reserves". That's it. That's the best you can ever hope for.
Nobody can manufacture gold out of nothing. Nobody can crash the gold market without spending a fortune to do it, and even when they do, the fundamentals will go and push it right back up again like a cork in water.
If BTC crashes that's it. Party's over. Your cryptographic keys are worthless. There's zero worth to this currency. Keep in mind that even Zimbabwe's largely worthless money has value *as a collectible item*. Those Bitcoin "coins" that got minted a while back will be worth far more than your BTC ever will in the long run. They're physical, tangible assets.
Enjoy the party while it lasts. Just don't get delusions about Bitcoin ever mattering when it comes to saving the US versus hyper-inflation. You either have no idea how large the US economy is or you're deluded about how far BTC can scale.

The US couldn't hold shit-all in BTC without either destabilizing the Bitcoin market or presenting a gigantic target of opportunity for rival states.
Not to mention there's only 21MM BTC available even *theoretically*, so presuming the price stays stable we're talking about $8-9B in total BTC value. That's essentially nothing in terms of foreign currency reserves. When it can handle *hundreds of billions* it will be taken more seriously.

Sony tried that with the Cell CPU/SPU combination in the PS3 and it was *extremely* unpopular with programmers. It took a radical rethinking of how to implement things to take full advantage of that architecture.
You weren't writing threaded code, you were writing separate programs that operated by exchanging signals in memory. It was more like programming a distributed system than traditional multi-process or multi-threaded code.
So yes, over time we'll be forced down that path, but the resistance at both the application and programmer layer will be considerable.

It's the best tool you've got. That people don't or refuse to exercise it is to their own detriment.
Honestly, work on a political campaign. They need to stay focused on those who vote. Those who don't are left out of the equation. If you vote and they know it, they have to pay attention.
Right now the people who vote tend to be more elderly, they will roll their rickety wheelchair to the voting booth and ask the nice people there to read out the names if they can't see. They're nothing if not stubborn about it.
Meanwhile able bodied youth will not even bother to go ten minutes out of their way to vote. It's astounding and shameful.

Okay, great, now they have what? Six months of that and you get $36M in BTC. That might sound like a lot on a personal level but for the US government it's so inconsequential it's not even worth hiring people to do it. That's like you personally having a micropenny invested in the Euro. Is it even worth your time to try?
The US accumulates over **$2B in debt per day**. I think you have no concept of how much money the US has to sink into a foreign currency for it to have any meaningful value to them. [This report indicates $121B in holdings]( $36M is not even a drop in that bucket. I bet they have more Rwandan currency kicking around in various accounts just to pay contractors and embassy costs than that.
If the total market cap of BTC was actually worth hundreds of billions and the US government had a significant stake don't you think people would try a lot harder to 51% it and destroy that stored value?
The cost of ruining BTC forever is large but well within the means of any nation-state out there. Even North Korea could decide to do it for shits and giggles if they wanted, just funnel some of their meth money into BTC mining rigs.

If the USD goes hyper-inflationary trust me when I say the last thing people will give any fucks about is BTC.
That would be pandemic and chaos on a level never before seen.


A piddly amount of BTC would do fuck-all. You're talking like a bandaid on a whale that's beached itself. It wouldn't even matter.




Is Satoshi some kind of omnipotent god that could have forseen all possible outcomes? No. Right now BTC is lucky it hasn't been disrupted and it's living on borrowed time as it is.
If the US heavily invested in it, and by "heavy" I mean **multiple tens of billions** as an absolute minimum, it would suddenly become a huge target for anyone looking to attack the US. This doesn't even touch on the fact that right now it's impossible to invest that much money in BTC without massively inflating the per BTC price.
Right now the only people mining BTC are those looking to profit. What if it became an arms race where all you had to do was out-spend your adversary? Drop a few hundred million in Chinese mining gear and, oh, look at that, we've got 60% of the mining pool.

We're depending on non-renewable aquifers already, and when those run out? It's bad. Really bad. Consider this: Large parts of the US become basically *uninhabitable*. Where is the water in Arizona you're going to purify in the first place?


Hardly? That's the kind of hand-waving dismissal that gets people into the worst kind of shit. It's like saying "since I've never died, I must be immortal".
The 50-100 years the scientists are predicting? Yeah, that's the *best* one, and the best keeps getting worse with each update. That's the thing about exponential curves. They're boring as hell until it hits the vertical. You do not want to be in the vertical on climate change.
I'm not saying we should throw up our hands in defeat or pull the plug on everything, shut it all down. Hardly! Just that we need a no-bullshit baseline to work from.
Now, obviously we'll survive all this, or at least *some* of us will, but if we keep pretending everything's okay it just makes the downfall harder and more severe.
Taking action today will be far, far cheaper than in the future. We need to think of what we can do to make minor course corrections now (e.g. using more recycled materials or curtailing urban sprawl) that will avoid having to make drastic ones in the years to come (e.g. fuel rations or outright banning private automobiles).
