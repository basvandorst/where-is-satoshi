Q1: Does OneBit support all PayWave and PayPass terminals?
Or Only terminals via some specific acquirers?
Because you said that 
Quote: "We will take part in the interchange fees that the merchant pays his acquiring bank."

Q1: Are these right?
  a: Terminals display the price in local fiat(ex. USD).  
  b: Users feel like paying in local fiat(ex. USD). But it's exchanged from BTC.  
  c: Merchants receive in same local fiat (ex. USD).

I think that Suica and Icoca use NFC type-F (Felica by Sony). Does Onebit support type-F? (probably you need HCE-F for Android?)
BTW, contactless terminals will be 100% by 2020 (EDIT: in Japan).

Not worldwide. only in Japan.

I don't see the point why it has to be the sidechains other than other blockchain or distributed ledger systems which has same features.

It sounds like a round robin scheme for selecting new leaders for every block.
"Round-robin vs sticky leaders" at Tendermint vs PBFT
I didn't know tendermint changed the spec, tho.
