Guys, just use

First time this has ever happened. Not sure what the problem is; hopefully just a minor technical glitch. I'm on hold with Capital One right now... will update when I get more info
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:28:03
Better safe than sorry. The Bitcoins are easy to 'convert' into a more liquid asset at a moments notice.
@_date: 2014-04-27 17:13:09
Yeah but I just lost that =(. Another one is coming in 5-7 business days. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 23:11:21
Lucky bastards, all I got was this shitty tattoo =(.
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:46:55
Yep! Easy as 1-2-3
@_date: 2014-04-27 23:25:40
Good luck breaking the BIP0038 encryption
@_date: 2014-08-12 16:20:30
Send me the BTC first and I'll buy them all. Otherwise, go crawl in a ditch.

Do you want to go to the moon? Because this, this is how we go to the moon.

Where can I buy these?
Edit: ... Doi it's on the front page -_-

If your wallets are properly made, "hacking" attempts are futile
@_date: 2014-04-16 13:32:20
All I had was diced onions, do you think that will be okay or should I throw in some thyme as well?
@_date: 2014-07-09 23:10:19
As cliché as it may sound, I'm in love with the technology. The price and any profits that may come from it is merely a much appreciated side-effect. I'd watch Bitcoins tank to 0$ before I sold out of my 'share'.
@_date: 2014-04-16 15:34:17
I am in full compliance with all current instantiated regulations and laws. Interpret that as you wish =D
@_date: 2014-05-29 07:16:53
I'm so happy!
@_date: 2014-04-16 13:20:43
Wow, this was the first post in /new when I went to bed, what an awesome sight to wake up to! Seems like I stirred up quite the debate =D.
Please.... do continue
Also, thanks for the gold!

Really =(. I think it's pretty cool that it's possible
@_date: 2014-08-01 17:18:04
I was there. Overall it was a good talk; well received by the audience. Xapo spoke as well (Debit cards are coming folks and they look really cool). Nothing out of the ordinary, just a great introduction to the world of Bitcoin.
Edit: There was a poll in the beginning of the talk, about 1/3 of the audience owned Bitcoin already.

What happens if I lose my phone, or it is compromised? I don't have a backup phone at home? 
@_date: 2014-04-27 17:17:00
I'm so sorry OP... It was just one chuckle =P
@_date: 2014-07-02 00:57:34
Yeah. Working fine on my end
@_date: 2014-04-27 23:25:26
No, the private key is BIP0038 encrypted. No-one can spend the coins unless they know my password
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:26:06
Yes, exactly

How many times in your life have you used your car airbags? What about your home alarm system?

I really like this. Never really struck me before, but Bitcoins are to cash as External HDDs are to your data.

It's very discrete. The opportunity cost is high enough that I'm not that concerned.

Nope, its collapse made me all the wiser. I actually think it was important that something like this happened to Bitcoin, not good by any means, but important nonetheless.

@_date: 2014-04-27 17:46:50
Even so, it is still much riskier.
@_date: 2014-04-27 16:48:06
Your coins aren't secure unless they exist offline in wallet where only you know the private key.
@_date: 2014-02-11 07:43:09


Yes, there is a 99.9897% chance they will ignore you. If somehow you get them to respond, I give it a 0.00001% chance they will give you your BTC.
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:09:26
BTC or USD?
@_date: 2014-08-11 15:51:56
~~Baffling or Brilliant~~ Revolutionary.
@_date: 2015-07-03 04:23:13
Oh! Well in that case.... don't lose all your coins =P
@_date: 2015-07-03 02:55:00
Not raining on your parade, your site looks solid and I'll dig through the source/pf verification later, but I can't help but notice the similarities: 
I'm all for competition and building it better than the last guy but you should still acknowledge inspiring sources.
Congrats on the launch, 
a software engineer
Edit: a word
@_date: 2016-02-12 02:58:47
Errr.... no. For starters, this goes against everything Bitcoin, it's effectively censorship. Moreover, you can't force people to develop a certain way or with a minimum feature-set. That's not how the Bitcoin protocol works, it is completely decoupled from the "wallet"/GUI side of things.
@_date: 2015-04-08 03:26:05
I too am experiencing this issue... unfortunately not before sending .7 BTC to it which are now stuck. If we have a jailbroken device, is there a specific file directory we can access that will allow us to retrieve the key? Perhaps something in the /Containers/Data/Applications/.... folder? 
@_date: 2015-11-05 14:11:34
I am a Software Engineer with a BS in Computer Science from Cornell University. How do I get involved in this?

This is the answer you are looking for
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:17:14
Congrats! You made the remaining Bitcoins worth just a tiny fraction more!

It's for cold storage so I won't be using it for a while. If/When I open it up I can just slice the laminate off.
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:34:11
Great post. This is the first thing I tell anyone looking to invest in Bitcions. This is a market unlike anything I've ever seen, and probably ever will see. That being said, it sure is exciting! (Even though you can watch your net worth fade before your eyes in a matter of minutes)
@_date: 2013-11-07 07:31:00
2FA &amp; Some cold storage is not
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:18:32
It does, just the LED aren't on
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:30:36
Indirectly, yes.
@_date: 2013-12-08 14:39:42
Oh sorry, I interpreted your post as much more 'flaming'. I understand what you mean by 'gambling' that it is going down. This is true, however these are risks I'm willing to take in order to potentially get a great payoff. It's just the same as holding or buying thinking it's going up. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:45:03
Ducky Shine II if I remember correctly. I bought it a couple years ago. It's a great keyboard!

@_date: 2013-12-15 06:43:08
Let the kid have some fun. Listen OP, how about this? You buy .25 BTC, just hold on to it. Put it away for safekeeping. Keep up with the news and watch Bitcoin either grow into something the world will come to use and prove itself to be one of the greatest inventions of it;s time, or... it could be an unbelievable flop ( although I'm shooting for the former =P, this is a 'real' possibility too ).... and then you get a PS4 and tell your Uncle to buy Himself something from the rest. Wins on all sides =)
@_date: 2013-12-14 13:35:48
Same =./
Hopefully just a DDoS
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:39:02
Wow, thanks for this info. I'm going to crack a few test ones open just to make sure. The printer I used is a high quality InkJet though so it should be okay.
@_date: 2013-12-08 14:29:21
Bitcoin is not gambling. It is an economic market just like anything else and therefore technical analysis applies. I have been a long time Bitcoin supporter (Since late 2010 when I first learned of it). That being said however, when an opportunity presents itself to increase my stash I'm going to take it even if it means selling my coins for a day or so.
Remember, be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful. Bitcion rose WAY to quick for its own good and needed to correct 'hard' sooner or later. Ignoring this and 'holding' through everything that happens to this market does not make you a bull or a 'true' believer. It makes you ignorant.
Edit: In response to the last half of your statement. I do use BTC for any purchases I can make online. I have also spread the 'word' to friends and family of which some have taken great interest.
@_date: 2013-11-30 06:57:30
Thank you so much =D. Really appreciate it!
@_date: 2013-11-07 13:21:00
I sold my lightbulbs to buy BTC silly!
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:31:59
I hope your joking. Otherwise, sell that immediately. Never invest money you actually need. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:30:57
... can't say it's not going well =D
@_date: 2013-11-07 13:20:39

Just replace "English" with Banks, and "Scottish" with Bitcoiners.
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:40:26
I made them myself =D. Never buy a wallet from someone else. You have no way of knowing if it secure.
