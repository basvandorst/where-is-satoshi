not true at all - I had a bunch of solid stocks that I thought were real solid with real products and fundamentals but that's not how the sock market works sometimes.  I of course had limited funds so I went all in on one stock at a time, just bad timing/luck picking stocks in 2017
edit: I'll also mention the stocks I picked were viewed as possible competition to Amazon so wall street analysts were screaming FUD and the stocks suffered

so you don't think any of these "good things" are piggy backing off of Obama?  I would ask you to re-evaluate where these things were heading at the end of Obama's tenure.  
But yes, the Business/Billionaire class loves Trump and that is reflected in the market for now, and perhaps his playing nuclear chicken with North Korea might seem to be a winning gamble at this moment, but that's probably the best one can say about Trump.  His tax bill is gonna fuck us in Crypto

I'd rather talk crypto than politics - but I can't let some stuff slide here.
Obama deported more than Trump
Obama was handed complete shit for an economy (thanks Republicans - if your gonna give a president credit for the economy - as your doing) , he turned it around (if your gonna give a president credit  - as your doing) and jobs have been increasing for his entire tenure.  Trump is piggy backing here easy
Obama decimated ISIS and they were already retreating to their last stronghold - this was about the time of the election - I knew this was going to be a "taking credit" strategy for Trump and his supporters, but really whatever - it doesn't matter what party wins this war - "WE" need to beat these fucking animals period.  Let whoever is in office take credit  &lt;I don't feel like looking up sources&gt;
I can't speak much of GDP (not my area of knowledge, but I do feel there are two economies - the economy of the rich which are doing great and the economy of everyone else who are not doing great.  Let me point out many people voted for trump because they felt the economy was not working for them and they were told he was going to drain the swamp and make the government/economy work in their favor).
North Korea - this isn't over yet - I hope this crazy game he is playing will work out, I will glady give him credit if we can find peace in this region.
I'm not going to talk politics anymore - this is a crypto forum but I just wanted to at least address what you said.  If anything lets talk tax bill and crypto going forward.  
edit: tax bill and how we can make it work to our advantage going forward

I hear you.  I am actually probably exactly opposite your leaning, and I get sick and tired of hearing right wing dumb shit when I read/watch investing news/sources - some people just can't help flashing their political daggers, but I just shrug and try to take what value I can from them.

Did your reading tell you who started all the War's Obama inherited?  Did your reading of material blame Obama for the destabilization of the middle east that has lead the the civil war between Shia and Sunni, which basically lead to the creation of ISL?
No offense mate, but I think you might need to look into this a little deeper
