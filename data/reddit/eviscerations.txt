good on you for wanting to make a difference.
just a thought, but perhaps consider things outside the bitcoin sphere.
i lost my fiance to ovarian cancer in 2011. i'm not particularly wealthy, but i try to make a donation to [the v foundation]( whenever i can. 100% of every cent goes directly to cancer *research*. i want to emphasize that, because many cancer 'charities' are for cancer *awareness*, and none of the money goes towards working for a cure.
whatever you put your money towards, thanks for being a good person.

i tried to load up 10$ steam balance during the black friday sale. it hung in the mempool for 5 days, never went through. bitpays system only allows a window of 15 minutes otherwise steam rejects the transaction. i emailed them about it. it's not usable in that state. the fees associated with adding a minimal balance are also higher than they should be for such small transactions. i'm glad they did stop taking it. wait to re-implement it when it has better functionality for their payment processor.

@_date: 2014-01-10 11:35:01
maybe because you wanted to, i don't know, buy bitcoin?
don't get me wrong, i've raged pretty fucking hard at coinbase csrs via email due to the bullshit algorithm, but let's look at this shit objectively for a minute.
coinbase is not an exchange, it's more akin to a broker.
ACH bank transfers aren't within coinbase' realm of control, without adopting different payment methods ie credit cards, debit cards etc.
lastly, anyone using coinbase as a place to buy low, and then turn around to sell high on another exchange, is a fucking retard.
coinbase, despite their shitty algorithm and other flaws, happens to be one of the better US based 'exchange' (term used loosely). i have to fly my shit to fucking indochina to get my account properly verified for mtgox or bitstamp or btc-e.
further, i was able to link a low balance savings account, and not a checking account, which i am far more comfortable with than giving them access to more of my personal information than they already have.
yeah, they have work to do. but you obviously know damn well why you 'did it in the first place'. you wanted to buy bitcoin. are you mad that you can't play daytrader using coinbase? i see this hostility towards to company yet most of the time it appears to me that the anger is a result of user stupidity.

yeah and i can appreciate that, but it doesn't do anything for my web needs. an android app on a phone in a brick and mortar store doesn't do anything for online sales.
perhaps i should give more details...
lightspeed has a point of sale system with a cloud based off site backend, bitpay has integrated with at least one POS company.
SoftTouch POS, a comprehensive solution for foodservice
using a point of sale system that has a built in webstore means that i don't need to use a cart system, or build a database for inventory or customers.
i'm looking for a company that offers similar services to bitpay, that works with a lightspeed point of sale system.

those charts aren't completely accurate. i mine, albeit small time, and the average is closer to 8-9 minutes - at least over the last week i've had bfgminer running without restarting.
the difficulty increase is based off of hashrate, so if it goes up, it's a % based off what the network hashrate is. 
i could be wrong but i believe the last increase was on the order of around 11% difficulty? something like that anyway. too lazy to look up the exact number.

i'll expand on that.
i bought a bfl jalapeno last june - it cost about 300$ usd. i didn't receive it until the 2nd week of december. had i bought btc at the time i had ordered my asic, i would have had about ~2btc (i think the price was around 160/btc at the time).
my asic runs full time, and so far has mined about .16 btc.
just some perspective for you.

the advantage - for me anyway - in using a savings account with not much more than a minimum balance, is that i can make a deposit when i want to buy btc, and i never have to worry about getting overdraft fees.
if a transaction would put my savings account into a less than minimum balance(i think its $25 in my credit unions case), it's simply declined. no harm, no foul.

we can agree to disagree on the pricing, but i think that's the least interesting feature of btc.
it's hard to not think there is obvious market manipulation happening when you can see it happen right in front of you.
gox front running btc for a long time, people shorting btc is obvious greedy behavior. 
not sure govt will step in, but they certainly want to.

i am not the right person to answer this because i have yet to "buy" anything with btc.
however, if i were to, i would pay the equivalent of USD, assuming that is the standard currency which they would convert to themselves, locally. if they were to prefer to convert to yen, then i would pay them the value in that. 
until various btc units have a certain standard of value, the price - to me - seems to fluctuate.

so as i understand this, the bfl jalapeno i've been running since the first week of november, which i paid about 300$ for, yet has mined about .2 btc, offsets any gain? .2 btc ≠ the money i paid for said asic last summer. it's likely it will never make it's ROI.
does this change over time? say if the value of my .2 btc from mining goes to the moon, is that a realized gain in which i would need to then file?

one could apply the same logic to your own post, your account is less than 1 day old.
whether by design, or oversight, or whatever, the ability to phish for users through their API is problematic for people who wish to retain a certain level of anonymity. 
i like coinbase; i use coinbase. i think their customer service can be pretty iffy at times. i also think they aren't dedicating enough resources towards staffing, and as such they have issues like this one. hopefully they will stay on it, and get these things corrected. then, none of this speculation will matter.

i'm a broke ass generally speaking. i can't afford to buy much btc myself, so i follow a simple practice: once every 2 weeks, instead of buying a pack of cigarettes - i smoke about ~1 pack a week - i'll throw 5-10$ towards a small purchase of btc.
i don't day trade, i hold what i buy, unless i see something i want to buy with btc. if you only buy small amounts, you're risking less than if you go all in and the market crashes.

if he was mining, you should also look for bookmarks or browser history entries for sites like bitminter, slush, or any other bitcoin mining pools.
as a miner myself, i don't often move my mined bitcoin until they reach a certain threshold (example: more than .01), but this can be set/changed at whatever pool he may have mined at.
if you can't find a wallet.dat file on your system, he likely used a web wallet or perhaps an alternative such as an unserviced phone (android maybe?), or even usb sticks, sd cards, and the like.
also, people are mentioning looking for an app called 'bitcoin', what you are looking for in that instance is probably a bitcoin client called bitcoin-qt. when installing applications myself, sometimes i change the default installations directory name from .../program files/bitcoin-qt/ to something simpler, ie: /qt/ or /btcqt/, you get the idea.
the wallet.dat file is the first thing to look for.
sorry this is complicated stuff for newbs, we as a community have to do a better job of explaining how this tech works, and also create more user friendly apps and services to explain the protocol to newcomers.

yep that's the point. prior to last spring i had been into btc because i thought mining was cool. i never got on ANY exchange - you could say my long term outlook is positive, from an 'investment' standpoint - but all it took was 1 friend who told me about the USD withdrawal restriction and i knew i'd never go there for any reason but to see what their buy price was.
day traders are there for 1 thing, to make money. they aren't concerned with the long term viability of the protocol. it's just greed.

well, i pre-ordered my jalapeno in june i believe? their customer support is on par with mtgox - that is to say, little to non-existent. the guy who runs the show there, BFL_JOSH as he is known on the forums, bigger troll than you'll find on any of these subs to be sure.
i received a tracking number in november? they emailed me and said it had been shipped. it didn't. not for another 3 weeks. they said that they had cleared their backlog a month earlier, but it turns out they were shipping out of sequence - they were supposed to ship based on order date.
oh and the power supplies for their units are known to randomly explode. units arriving defective, requiring you to pay for it to get shipped back, and then wait some period of weeks to months to get your unit back. all that time, you aren't mining.
it's a joke of an outfit. 
i highly recommend going over to bitcointalk forums, or even bfl forums, if you want an example of what i'm talking about.
i made my purchase based on an article that came out last april, i forget the site it was on. anyway, i'd been looking into investing in an asic for a month or so by that time, figure early adoption would provide best chance for achieving ROI.
not the case.
only way i will get that back is to either a) sell my asic soon at the highest possible price i can, or b) hope btc goes to like 2000$.
i don't expect i will be earning .0005 per block in 3 months time, that's for sure.

i am upvoting this, but not because i agree with the OP.
they are sad stories to be sure. but the signs were there. i guess i'm biased, because i live well below the 'poverty line'. 
i feel bad they were ignorant, and didn't research the risks. i have no sympathy for day traders not interested in the long term viability of bitcoin, and who were solely looking to profit from it. beyond that, meh.

this is a lot of speculation on my part, but after seeing that the feds are - according to the press anyway - trying to unload their silk road coins, then i don't think that they have any interest in controlling bitcoin.

i'm inclined to believe this is bullshit.
but, playing along for funsies.
 - coinbase should not be used as a wallet. it's a brokerage. people who use coinbase as a wallet are giving up their private keys to a business, and are not in control of their btc.
 - i've used coinbase for over a year, and i have never had any problems sending btc. ever.
as such, this must be a troll.

you need to copy the information from your C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin

then you want to right click on bitcoin-qt (the executable) and go to properties, edit as such (to suit your needs obviously):

to expand on this, it might take you 40 sessions to get enough captchas filled to make a 'withdrawal'.

because coinbase isn't an exchange solvency isn't as much an issue. they are more of a brokerage. they middle man the shit.

it's actually not. 
this is a great time for the community. the largest and oldest exchange failed, and bitcoin keeps chugging along. there are efforts to introduce standards in security. 
gox failing is great for bitcoin, just like silk road getting shut down was great for bitcoin. every news article claiming it's dead sounds eerily similar to the same nonsense being spun about the internet 20 years ago.
i'm very bullish.

a nicer layout than text is obviously a good place to start.
are you going to embed soundclouds player on your site or how are you going to go about this?
here's another random question: when i upload tracks to soundcloud - because i am not an upgraded member there, my minutes are limited - i only upload 'clips', 30-45 seconds, and nothing actually sequenced out to completion.
i occassionally get requests to draw something out and then someone takes it and puts vocals over it or whatever. so are you planning on making this just a site to sell music or are you thinking of this as more of a resource for artists maybe who are interested in say working on audio for independent film makers, or game developers, etc?
you could outline your 'mission objective' a little more.
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:58:53

this is the theory floated by adam levine and charlie shrem on the last LTB podcast, however i have a hard time believing that after getting their shit pushed in, that previous gox clients would be willing to give it another go with whomever decided to purchase/rebrand the company.

not sure this will be the answer you are looking for but, i'll give it a go.
i have a bfl jalapeno which is i believe 65nm chips, and the new miners are 28nm chips, which are supposed to be more energy efficient.
older tech obviously is slower, so it could very well be that mining companies want to unload whatever stock they have as they prepare (two weeks) to release new tech to the public.
pure speculation on my part.
i did notice that bfl haven't exactly lowered their prices though. i didn't bother to check knc or any of the other outfits.

here's the deal, people will downvote you on here and troll you and whatever. they'll say "but coinbase IS A WALLET", despite it actually just providing wallet services and it actually being much more of an exchange than a wallet.
online wallets aren't in your control. you have money in THEIR wallet.
if you don't have your coins in your possession, then they aren't really yours.

it's "very very risky" in the sense that you are - at today's market price of ~570$/1btc - gambling ~23$ for a chance, albeit a very slim chance, of making a huge return.

i haven't seen anything yet in my inbox, though i've been watching since that disclosure the other day.
seems to be more than a "privacy" issue, to me. people still fall for nigerian email scams, and emails coming from coinbase directly, although not necessarily initiated by them, are blatant attempts at social engineering.
thankfully most people who are into bitcoin should be smart enough to know not to get scammed. it only takes 1 poor sod getting ripped off to make it profitable for those trying to engage in these tactics.

i paid ~300$ for my bfl jalapeno - does between 7.9 and 8.1 gh/s. took 6 months to get here. would have been better served buying btc outright, considering the cost plus the wait time.
just some perspective. i can't vouch for any asic manufacturers as of this moment, i have no experience with any of them other than BFL, and my experience with them is that it was brutal. and not in a good heavy metal kinda way.

the asic i have cost 300$. hardly a lot of fucking money, and that i had to buddy up to afford it should be an indication of how little money i have.

coinbase is usually a few bucks higher than btce or bitstamp. i am not exactly sure why the disparity is as much as it is, other than their fees are higher due to their operating as a brokerage instead of a more traditional exchange.

you're saying that you young so let me try to explain this to you:
reddit karma isn't worth shit. internet points aren't the fuel that drive the global economy. stop caring about up/downvotes; they're worthless. literally. you can't buy shit with them, they don't increase your sex appeal, they aren't going to get you laid or get you promoted, etc. 
i can't emphasize this further. it is really not worth your time to give a fuck about being upvoted or downvoted.
what you should do about your situation is message the mods and/or reddit administrators. admins in particular have some potential for recourse (maybe they can forward the shit on to law enforcement for cybercrimes or something - but don't get your hopes up)
the lesson you need to learn here is that nobody on the internet is going to help you double your btc. period. you want your btc to grow in value, then follow the advice that has been given here literally hundreds of thousands of times - HODL. i been here for almost 5 years, and we've been saying the same thing the whole time. don't trust strangers with your money. if you don't control the private keys, then it's not your bitcoin. etc. etc. etc.
tons of fucking assholes on this sub anymore, and admittedly i'm an asshole myself. i do, however, have some sympathy. you got scammed. it happens. learn from your mistakes. better luck next time.

no proof, not satoshi.

he owes the tax man. likely has a lot of other obligations to creditors.
the angle is pretty obvious: get people to believe you are sitting on a fortune in bitcoin, rendering you capable of eliminating these constraints. if people believe he's sitting on, what, half a billion usd worth of btc? then all of his problems go away. except they don't. he's just painting a target on his back.
it's also entirely plausible that he's been compromised by the banking industry in an attempt to gain control over the blockchain - something they themselves can't do due to the decentralized nature of it. by gathering a consensus from the community believing his bullshit, he'd be able to hold sway over the future development - pushing larger blocks, engaging with banks and governments, etc.

this is correct. i have a july 9th order that is apparently due to arrive today, after having received a tracking number for "priority 2 day shipping" on the 7th of this month. so, 9 days after they "shipped" my order 2 day priority, i might actually get it. the tracking information didn't even update to say it had shipped until the 13th.
they probably said their 'backlog' was filled when they cleared up to june, decided to have a black friday sale, shipped off stock that was meant for july - october buyers, and fucked over people who bought their shit first.
i never did end up getting a reply to my pm to "bfl_emily" after being directed to send one, even to this day. it's been weeks. 
but seriously, there is no excuse for poor customer service. i run a small business, if i treated my customers/clients they way bfl did/does, i wouldn't run a business any longer.

@_date: 2013-12-19 00:51:08
i feel i need to comment on this, for whatever reason. i normally read, and don't post... anyway...
i bought a jalapeno in july. when thanksgiving rolled around, and they had the blog post about "backlog cleared", and remaining orders would be shipped out "within a few days", i was happy. they were at the end of june prior to that post, and thus i figured i'd be getting my unit soon thereafter.
i got an email on the 7th of december, 10 days after that blog post, with a tracking number. i checked the tracking number throughout the days, for several days, and it never updated beyond 'electronic shipping information received'. this was supposed to be 2-day priority usps.
tracking info finally updated on the 11th. i got my package on the 14th.
there is a post above me here somewhere, where someone mentions that they bought 10 jalapenos on black friday, and got them within a matter of days.
this leads me to believe that after bfl cleared their 'backlog', which i assume they determined to be everything up until the end of june, they were apparently done with that line. they shipped, out of sequence, to other customers who paid way after i did.
thats fucking trollish bullshit.
i hope josh shits out his guts one of these days.

imo you could always go to the block chain, although complex, you have a complete public record of all transactions on the network.
so you need to narrow you search to certain parameters; what mining pool - if not their own - did they have their products working on? anyone get a refund in BTC from BFL? got a wallet address? did they use the same address to do multiple refunds?
seems as good as any place to start.
