Apparently it is ... see this source quote by our friend ...

Well, perhaps you should find out who are the Money Mafia. Then you probably will agree they will not tolerate any form of currency that they couldn't control and profit from the supply.
I give you a clue - They charge interest from supplying some $150 trillions USD to the U.S. alone.
Don't get me wrong, I am pro cryptocurrency. The question is ... How do we circumvent the Money Mafia? Don't forget, they control the governments

It is a pro-crypto piece - Read "CRYPTO LIBERTY: END CENTRAL BANKING NOW"
I am 100% for crypto.

I know you guys hate the news.
Instead of downvoting the news, perhaps we should discuss how to find a solution to circumvent the Money Mafia. 
If Lincoln and JFK were assassinated because these two POTUS wanted to take control of money supply (read JFK Executive Order 11000) ... You can imagine what will the Mafia do if Bitcoin is eating into the fiat currency business (assuming the Mafia can't profit from cryptocurrencies).
Guys, get real. You'd do the same thing if you were the Mafia.

Let's say you're right. We shouldn't discount the "what if they do ban it"?
Well, just look Trump, he did everything people thought can never happen in U.S., right?

- While The optimist experts believe the cryptocurrency market could hit $1 trillion this year with bitcoin surging to $50,000,
- The Money Mafia says cryptocurrency will fall to Zero, Zilch, Nada.
So, Will Cryptocurrency Market Tank Or Shine?
Neither is correct.
First of all, we believe the prospect for cryptocurrency to replace the fiat currency is pretty bleak. But it will not will fall to Zero as suggested by the Money Mafia... [More](

Why not? All that they have to do is tell the respective government to ban it. 
Once it's banned, how do you convert to local money? It's not like you can buy everything with crypto now. 
How can Crypto flourish under such circumstances? (I imagine you still can buy and sell secretly in small number. But it won't be very big volume due to conversion problem).
Am I wrong?

Another interesting point is Bitcoin is not shares, bonds, or commodity.
Because all those mentioned is backed by something. Share is backed by the business, bonds are backed by loans, commodity is obviously backed by the produce. And even Fiat Currency is actually also backed by something ... Your taxes!
Now, what is Bitcoin backed by? 
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:16:16


Well. Bitcoin was designed to beat the fiat currency. And decentralization is supposedly the answer.
Is it?
Let me ask you this question, how can Bitcoin be the initial payment? I mean as long as you are paid in local currency, you will have to use local currency to convert to Bitcoin first. Same thing for the supplier. They need to pay their supplies/workers in local currency.
As long as there is no way to have 100% Bitcoin, the government can always kill off Bitcoin by simply passing one bill to ban it.
In fact, They already started to ban cryptocurrency in China and India.
How to overcome this problem?
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:02:39


There is a very good reason. A free crypto will hurt their pocket. They make perpetual interest on fiat currency. And they print any amount they like and much, much more. eg wars (super profitable), economic meltdown (that's when they can buy blue chips for pennies) ... with all the negative consequences go to folk. 
Still not good enough a reason?


Climate Change is important? Now that's ridiculous, if you ask me.
If it is so important why the world biggest democracy (U.S.A) can get away with it? Trump is  Anti-Carbon, and he still get elected, right?
Obviously you have no clue who put him in the office ... FYI, They're called Money Mafia. They control the Congress, they control both GOP and DEM, the control all the media. Meaning, the mainstream media won't even report the truth should they decide to assassinate Crypto... They will probably report something like "Cryto is now regulated as result of extreme instability posed to the economy".
Know why Lincoln and JFK were assassinated? Go read about Executive Order 11000. Then come to tell us what is difference between Executive Order 11000 and Crypto?
Hope this helps you understand the reality better.

Good to know that. Please share with us your experience, 
How much Bitcoin as % in all your transaction? I mean everything you receive and pay out.
Do you pay you supply/worker in Bitcoin too?
Most important of all, **do you have a way to get Bitcoin in the event your government ban the cryptocurrency**? Try to answer this one ... This will give me an absolute insight to predict the near future of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:54:14
Of course. That's why I posted this shit news ... hoping we can think together for a solution.
As it is now, cryptos are just lambs waiting to be slaughtered (by the Mafia).
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:44:34


This is interesting. I thought it has been banned there. 
Pls. Tell us why the China ban doesn't work?
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:17:43
Totally Possible. Actually, I think it will go up soon. But not in the long run ... I still believe in the Money Mafia. As long as this parasite is there controlling the U.S. ... Fat chance for any cryptocurrency to see the light.
Unless they can create one that they can control., They will kill it as soon as it become popular as a medium of exchange. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:51:03


I think they can if they really wanted to ... See Chinna, all that is needed is a Great Firewall. Of course, this is quite unlikely in bigger democracies.


Now this is getting interesting.
Is something like Game Token the answer?
Can they ban all the Game Tokens? Possible but unlikely, messy and difficult ... Therefore mainstream application will be unlikely = not much volume - I suspect most people will find tiring to convert from this to that?
But Yes, I do agree this is one way if they do ban crypto.
Good idea.


Nobody like to use fiat if they could because there is interest/inflation behind it ...perpetual one.
But do you see people stay away from fiat like plague? No, because we all need to eat and so on.
The situation is possible only if you can get most things with bitcoin eg. you boss pay you in bitcoijn, you can buy bread with bitcoin. If that happens, Money Mafia have lost the game. Like I said, They will not let that happens in the first place, unless they can control crypto.
I think it's better to think of circumventing idea like the Game token type.
What happens to China, anyone? Do they use Game token?
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:09:59


A universal currency maybe easier, but they can profit the same from difference currencies (as it is today).
How does that suggest they will spare cryptocurrencies (assuming they have no control over ie. couldn't profit from  cryptocurrencies). Why wouldn't they kill them. It's not like they not capable of doing so.


 
Well, it's reported by RT.com etc. It sounded legit to me. 
Even if it is fake, the prospect for crypto remain the same ... As it is now, as soon as the Mafia wanted crypto to die, crypto won't survive another day. 
So far, I see couple of things only
1. If the Mafia can profit from it. Meaning crypto won't be crypto anymore. Back to square one.
2. If crypto can move faster than lightspeed and completely replace fiat currency ie. you can buy most things with crypto. But I think the Mafia will make the killing before this become a reality.
3. There is a way to convert crypto into something liquid, something valuable, something easily convertible to money ... What is that SOMETHING?
Any idea?
@_date: 2018-02-11 09:47:45


Why not? The Mafia directly or indirectly control all governments except for North Korea, Iran, and Cuba. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:53:42
I don't know. 
Still, there is no reason to believe it will never happen, ever.
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:51:25


There is hope as long as they don't ban it. Once it's banned even those who accept Bitcoin before will most likely refuse to accept anymore, I am afraid.
The only thing I disagree with you is the speed. You said change slowly. I think it must change overnight (so that the Mafia got no chance to kill the Crypto). 
Actually, it will be interesting to find out what happens to China now?
The already banned it in China. Do people still trade there? How do they convert? This may lead us somewhere ... Anyone?
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:42:37
They cannot what?
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:59:32
I actual read that article,. It says the same thing.
Look, if they regulate it, then its no longer crypto. It will be something like PayPal, different flavor, Right?
Second, how does France alone regulates everywhere in the world? It take the world to do so, right? Right now, only Money Mafia has such power. And because they're for profit gang, they are likely to ask government to do it in a way that benefit them - we're back to the same problem. Right? 
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:07:16
There are many ways to describe the same thing.
Why don't you tell us why would want to regulate it in the first place? The true reasons, not the excuses.
@_date: 2018-02-11 09:52:27
I hate bank too.
But how to buy sell crypto without bank? I imagine the only way is you do not need cash (fiat currency).
All banks are a part of the Money Mafia - including central banks, BIS, IMF and a new world central bank soon.

Then please explain what's backing the greenback, if not for the fact that it's backed by the government/IRS will tax the hell of out folks to pay back the debt, Moron.
