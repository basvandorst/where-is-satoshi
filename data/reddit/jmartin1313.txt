I have no intention of ever converting my btc back to usd. And I’m going to convert as many usd into btc as I can while the exchange rate is still low.

You’re reading it wrong. The spike is there at the end of 2017.

Crypto will replace fiats as the world currency. Bitcoin might not be a ‘daily currency’ but will play a major role and lead the way in the transition. Just my humble opinion.

So short sighted

Excuse my ignorance, as I’m new to the game, but are the two mutually exclusive? One of the things I love about BTC and crypto in general is the ‘decentralized philosophy’, but won’t the technology continue to progress even with an ETF approval? It seems as though an ETF would just bring a bit more legitimacy to bitcoin.

I agree. Retail transactions and mainstream adoption don’t seem to be the benchmark of trust and sustainability at this point. You either believe the technology is the future or you don’t. Seems to me that more and more people are beginning to understand and believe in it.

Hold bitcoin. Short term profit is irrelevant. Sell now and you’ll be kicking your own ass everyday for the rest of your life.
