He would probably think it's funny.  I guarantee that he has seen it also.  He looks at reddit just like the rest of us.

That's definitely not the whole point of crypto.  If you think that's the case then you are WAY WAY off.  Yeah, it's a great feature, but it's a feature that 95% of the population isn't concerned about.
If that's the reason people wanted crypto then they would just use cash for everything. 
Do some more research on what you are investing in if you think decentralization of currency is simply about controlling your own money.

Maybe you didn't read my post, but I clearly said "that's not the WHOLE point of crypto"
I've been buying crypto for years and I believe in it strongly so you don't need to shill me on it or teach me anything about it.  I was simply saying that in the post above me the user said the ONLY reason to get crypto is so that nobody can control your funds.  That is so untrue.  I don't mind someone being in control of my funds too much, but I am a strong believer in borderless payments and low transaction fees.

Exactly what I'm saying... You said "the whole point" and I said, yeah, that's a great feature, but it's not the reason people get into crypto... the reasons you listed are great reasons to invest in crypto, but your first comment saying the whole point is so that other people aren't touching your money is what I was referring to obviously.

Musk did not say that.  That's stretching what he said by quite a bit.  He said paper money will go away and crypto is a better solution than fiat.  He did not say crypto will replace paper money.  It's a very long process and in 30 years or however long it takes, there may be a better solution than crypto.

That's 100% not in any way true.  Most miners aren't in direct contact with a hedge fund manager.  The mining is so decentralized there is no way to contact anyone who would come up with even like 10% of the daily rewards of mining.  Even if they managed to contact a single miner who contributed 5% of the hashpower (there may be a few miners who can contribute 5 to 10% total hash) that's only about 120 or so BTC a day.  The mining giants are actually very decentralized and they don't see more than like 5% of the rewards that they get credited because they have to pay the people mining for them.

1, that's not what is happening... 2, when you do that continually every day for years you're pissing away thousands of dollars.  Just because you're operating a large business doesn't mean that you don't care about smaller costs.   These smaller costs typically have a much higher quantity and it's all a numbers game to become the most profitable.  No business owner is going to say "might as well throw away $20 every 15 minutes just for shits and giggles because we are making a high profit anyway"

I don't agree with this statement at all. Nobody in the right mind spends $22 on something that costs 10 cents... It gives you no extra insurance or any sort of perks

In the past, tourism was a big part of the struggling economy.  As with most islands, a good portion of the revenue needs to be generated from tourism, but there was a huge lack of tourism.  That is changing so incredibly fast.  Palawan is quickly becoming one of the most desired places for people to visit.  When we went there 3 or 4 years ago we saw literally 0 other white people on our whole trip through all of palawan and cebu.  Everyone stared at us more or less.  Everyone was so incredibly friendly though, it wasn't a stare in a bad way.  Once the world understands the insane beauty of the Philippines, it will have a much better economy if the government doesn't completely screw that up.  Knowing the tiny bit I do about their current government, I'm not overly optimistic about that though.

Are you figuring your delivery charge and taxes into that? I originally thought my rate was 0.0348 because that was my electrical supply charge. When I do the math on my actual kwh used I'm paying 0.083 per kwh.  Might be worth looking into because I know my supply charge is one of the lowest in America outside of solar.

That's literally what happened... That fork was named bitcoin cash.  It has its own dev team, it's not Roger vers project. I get the bch hate, but you need to understand that what you are saying is EXACTLY what bch is.  It forked because of the failed scaling and at the time had a lot of users interested in the development of on chain scaling. Now that scaling is pretty much no issue at all because nobody is using crypto, bch is pretty much nothing.  If scaling becomes an issue again, bch has relevance again.

I agree with everything you are saying, but comments like that are gonna get downvoted into oblivion here haha

accounting and coding to ensure everything goes as planned with transactions... sure, they could leave a wallet up for donations and that would be far less work (virtually none) but to ensure that things are paid for correctly with bitcoin is just another hassle

Simply put, no... Blockstream is 100% committed to lightning network.  If it fails, bitcoin fails... There is 0 chance of them implementing bch values after the massive fork debate.
