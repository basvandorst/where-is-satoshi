 I feel like you're being far more dramatic than you need to be in your criticism, simply because the hive mind has decided to that it hates Elon this week.

Best case scenario - the cops break down your door, put a gun to the head of you and your loved ones  and scream at you to get on the ground. Chances are you're might get battered up a little bit while they detain you and your family.. From there, you'll be tasked with convincing the law enforcement officers that you're innocent. After proving your innocence, they'll uncuff you, apologize for breaking down your door and leave. 
Worst case scenario - pretty much identical to what I stated above, except somebody riding a little too high on the adrenaline rush overreacts and someone dies. This is rare, though.. I think only one person has been wrongfully killed in a swatting incident,as far as I am aware. 
Bear in mind I'm not trying to demonize law enforcement by any means. But that's just what happens. There's YouTube videos of people getting swatted, some of them are pretty intense.

Law enforcement most likely thought OP was at his house, and were probably prepping to go door smashing when OP arrived at the scene. When OP got wind of what was happening , he probably called his wife, telling her that something was up. At this point, his wife likely went outside, where she was likely detained (NOT ARRESTED) until she could confirm that this was a mistake and there was no threat present.
Now, had OP not come home when he did, the wife would've been completely oblivious to the fiasco that was going on outside her front lawn. And if she hadn't confronted law enforcement, they would've assumed OP was still in the house, and taken measures secure the situation (i.e., door smashing, etc etc) 
I'm having a difficult time articulating an explanation for you, but I hope my response kinda makes sense?
