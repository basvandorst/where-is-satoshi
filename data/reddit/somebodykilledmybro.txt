Eh, ive found the technology has actually turned off ALOT of people i know outside of being decentralized and unmutable. General complaints are energy use, transaction speeds and fees. If Bitcoin had all these variables working for its ecosystem alot more people would have changed their tune and honestly who can nlame them. Bitcoin is 10 years old and were here? The price is great and i wont complain about that but the development of bitcoin makes me smh along with many others.

Bitcoin is a it is a throttled currency that is nowhere near being ready to scale for world use even after being 10 years old bitcoin is just too slow for transactions to be performed over 20k tps and can be extremely expensive to use -2017 anybody? Since second layer solutions are the only thing being considered (lightning), hopefully this bullheaded approach to scaling helps. Otherwise, we're all just stuck here waiting (hodling) with no end in sight.

I prefer to go number one ;)

Its good but its not good enough, scaling still is an issue even after 10 fucking years. A  killer app would be a lightning ;) fast btc network. Cant wait untill we finally arrive and I know im not the only one who is excited!

Does anybody actually like this guy? I remember  him once saying that he is ok with bitcoin being exclusionary  to the unbanked who cant afford to pay massive fees when bitcoins mempool is full. Ive always viewed this his jack ass as an enemy of bitcoin.

Thats correct
@_date: 2019-10-06 23:17:04
I agree which makes him an enemy of bitcoin. He was clear about this in one of his public debates.
@_date: 2019-10-06 22:51:49
He made his position very clear as i recall. It was embarrassing. I do agree about lightning allowing for this if it ever becomes secure enough to use.

The moment you get it, whatever the price of btc is that is your income. You should cash out your btc if you want that ammount immediately (and its probably safer for tax purposes) or you can hold on to the btc and declare a capital gain/loss whenever you decide to exchange for cash.

I never said xrp is better 100%, the only reason i like bitcoin is its made money, just like other coins
@_date: 2019-09-27 05:14:04
I hodl bitcoin mostly, im just saying that most coins have btc beat outside of being  first mover

How is it a sham? Ive traded crypto and it was faster and cheaper to transact then bitcoin. Bitcoin has been out for 10 years and competitors have already figured out scaling issues, tx fees, speed etc.

Wasnt he the guy who took a shitload of btc illegitimately?
