I wonder how profitable their projects are on this. And how they are looking at it.
@_date: 2018-10-16 02:40:10
right but this isn't cash, this is BTC, with a very large divisible option. So why would someone not just send the exact amount?
The only time you hand someone a $20, for a $5 item is when you have too much on you and can't pay the specific amount or want smaller amounts for some future purchase.. In BTC they can always select the specific amount. So what am I missing here?
@_date: 2018-10-15 22:05:25
Long answer...?
@_date: 2018-10-12 20:23:12
In your opinion, is there any specific sub redits / forums where the most educated debates / brain storms occur?
For example, in the online bodybuilding scene there is specific forums where the educated pseudo-scientists match up and share information, experiment on themselves, sites like gh...-15 etc.

That makes sense. I get it now. Appreciate it.
I know several millionaires. Some with 100k-500k cash in their house for whatever reason. Some with 50million in their bank. Though they have a few accounts and keep track of things. I also know they have transferred money from an unlikely account like their savings before for event specific reasons. It happens lol.
@_date: 2018-10-16 02:44:50
I am going to risk looking stupid here in the name of education..
Why is pulling all of it out secure? We still get to see where it goes, it's not like we lost track of the left overs. Whats the benefit for security rather than just pulling out exactly .83 BTC from the original 30kBTC wallet?
I don't think asking why they are dipping into a 30kBTC account is the better question. That's no different than a multi millionaire pulling money out of his savings bank account imo. It happens.
@_date: 2018-10-16 04:08:40
So because he has so much in his wallet, it's cheaper for him to push 30k, and let the change of that 30k be the correct remaining amount in the desired wallet, then have to send a the .83BTC x amount of times to reach 30k total?  
So if that is the case, does the wallet automatically decide he is trying to move this small amount, he has this much, let's do it this way?
@_date: 2019-11-25 00:16:31
When your 60 YO mom is buying the dip, is when you don’t.
@_date: 2018-10-16 15:49:46
Very good to know. 
Is there any wallets you know of that have shown bitmain(evil)-like tactics? Or any wallets that arn't open sourced or specific red flags you've seen in this category to date? 
@_date: 2018-10-16 04:44:07
And the 2 outputs together have to equal the input. I think I got it.
Can you modify it then and have let's say 5 outputs that equal 1 input?
and is it the wallet that is the automated cashier or the bitcoin code itself?
(ITT: We explain BTC payments to someone who hasn't moved his bitcoin) Appreciate all the answers, very helpful.
@_date: 2018-10-17 18:34:00
I appreciate that! Thanks. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 04:57:55
Where does one see his UTXO's? Or keep count of his "dust"..?
Just when I thought I was getting it, we introduce dust lmao...
@_date: 2018-10-16 15:28:32
Is Dust relative to what someone considers small amounts of BTC then? Or is Dust relative to the total price of 1 BTC at that time? Or is Dust a term used for any form of fractional amount of BTC?  
I understand what  UTXO is now, and why it looks like two amounts were sent. I am still foggy on how to consolidate your "dust", and minimize transaction fees. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 02:57:47
Thank you for this explanation. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 21:59:56
Is it possible to audit the block chain and track the wallet/wallets this coin came from? Curious if there is anyway to spot certain private institutional otc trading desks.  
@_date: 2018-10-16 02:13:02
I am aware of that. I was seeing if there was a way to follow it to the OTC market. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 15:32:26
Do the "smart wallets" automatically notice if you are trying to send something that is more than just 1 of your private keys contains and automatically combine as many private keys from your wallet together to sum up = to what you are sending? 
If all this is happening behind the scenes with wallets, why are we trusting that wallet designers arn't setting up a code to receive incremental amounts or something? (conspiracist nature lol... sorry)
@_date: 2018-10-16 15:06:04
This link is everything I needed. Thank you.
@_date: 2018-10-16 03:06:25
If it is Bitfinex as people think, then wouldn't it make sense it was a larger wallet they had, and they needed to move that smaller amount out of it to fill a customer order? Can we track where the .83BTC went?
@_date: 2018-10-16 15:15:11
I feel like you came into this thread and didn't bother to read any of the extremely well thought out and educated replies people took the time to write. They explained why it showed up that way, and it makes perfect sense once you understand the fundamental concept of UTXOs + avoiding the double spend. 
@_date: 2018-10-12 19:09:44
Appreciate that. Will definitely check it out. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 01:38:07
Thank you! 
You called the wallet “his” did evidence show it’s a whale and not a potential desk acquiring coin? 
Also can you track coin before the cold wallet or the trace stops there? 
@_date: 2018-10-16 15:33:30
Sometimes you just have to re-ask the question 50 times learning a little more with each answer as you go until it comes together like a beautiful picture in your head. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 04:20:31
Yeah definitely caught me off-guard.   
So does the user choose to send back to his original wallet address or to "wallet c", or does the wallet he's using automatically decide this?
@_date: 2018-10-16 04:14:58
@_date: 2018-10-15 21:50:04
Is it possible to audit the chain far enough back to find out where this 12,220 came from? A way to find the private institutional OTC desks no one wants to share.
@_date: 2018-10-16 02:46:53
Good question... Anyone have the answer?
@_date: 2018-10-16 02:06:57
What would be a logical reasoning for moving 30k BTC to only liquidate .83BTC?
@_date: 2018-10-16 04:02:51
So does this automatically occur with most wallets, making it simpler for the user? Or does the user have to know to move their entire stash to use a little of it, to remain secure?
@_date: 2018-10-16 04:00:55
So do you have to pay the fee's of moving the entire 30kBTC just to spend .83BTC because the input:output?

@_date: 2018-10-12 20:37:02
This link is awesome. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-10-16 04:06:05
So in this case, the owner wanted to use .83BTC, which triggered his wallet to automatically move his entire 30k, move the .83btc, and move the remaining of the 30k to a new wallet?
@_date: 2018-10-16 15:39:02
Is there anyway you could write up an example of a transaction involving Dust and the fees? 
like for example: Alice has a total of 12BTC, she has .006 UTXO from Bob, she wants to send 10btc... or something similar to this structure? 
I really appreciate you taking the time to answer these questions. 
@_date: 2019-10-20 19:29:17
What you are calling DCA (automated investing), is less risk, and less reward. It's not for everybody. And it isn't always the best strategy.
@_date: 2019-12-05 23:50:33
Sure. Just sign the house over to me first.
@_date: 2018-12-26 02:05:53
Thanks super easy with that.  
2ph in July would of averaged around 20btc in the last 6mo. 
  
Nice.
