Disagree, better to have good enough security to not be hacked at all than to recover from it...

Wow I totally assumed it would have considered price rise. That's a cop-out indeed

If it immediately gave litecoin segwit I would do it

Absolutely not, nothing like that was allowed. Only drugs and money. Ross has libertarian ideals and was always against harming anyone. No child porn either.


No! It was completely fabricated. He was never even charged for it because there was no evidence, and corrupt police (they have been charged for stealing money etc) had access to his accounts. A mystery person even signed into his account while he was incarcerated. I'm very sure that he wasn't involved in hitman stuff, it just doesn't make sense. What does make sense is that police wanted to damage his image by putting out these unfounded lies; it worked.

He would never have known about bitcoin early without wanting to buy, so I can't see how that makes sense. Most early adopters got rich because they were trying to get high.
