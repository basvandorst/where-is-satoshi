Yes. And they should pay taxes if they earn over $1000.

So, first you need to know how much you invested, let’s say 1000.
Now let’s say that is now worth 5000 but you never sold ANY crypto, you have no liability until you trigger a gain.
Let’s say you sold at 4000 reinvested and it got to 5000, you owe taxes on a gain of your REALIZED gain (4000) less your initial investment (1000) so you would owe taxes on $3000. 
Any time you sell you trigger an event.
Now how much you pay is dependent on how long you held. You get preferential tax treatment if you held for over 12 months.
If the event was triggered at less than 12 months, it should be taxed as ordinary income (whatever your income tax rate is) 
If you held for 12 months, it should be taxed at your preferential rate (usually around 1/2 of the ordinary rate). 
If you sold one coin for another, something called a like-kind exchange may have happened, although I do not know if this is allowed. 
I am not an expert at crypto accounting, but I hope this is a start.
When you know how much money you earned from crypto, and how to classify it, you just need to plug it into the correct section of your 1040. 
If you incurred losses you can write those off to offset gains. 
Good luck!

This guy has terrible judgement to have a name like OGNasty and try to be a professional online. I do not want anyone with the title of OG or Nasty anywhere near my untraceable currency.

Does bitcoin have a higher probability of hitting 1 penny or 1 million is the real question

When did the cost to manufacture decide the amount that people will spend?

Run your plan, let us know how it works out. I personally have no faith in bitcoin, but I understand there is money to be made.
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:15:10
Opposed to bitcoin which is easily transferred, accepted everywhere, and the irs doesn’t want a cut of?

They didn’t “do an audit” they read news articles. There are specific steps to consider what you are doing is an audit to provide a certain level of assurance. An audit needs to have a specific purpose as well, which this claimed was to test details on US dollar transactions from the federal reserve. They mentioned no testing, no test details, and no information on there sources.
-an auditor.

What? No they collect taxes to pay debt.

Government debt is not like business debt. The government never needs to pay the 21 trillion, they do have to pay the interest on the 21 trillion which reduces the governments ability to provide services for the government people. The interest paid every year was roughly 5% of the total government spending.
