Wow. You have managed to put into words the distaste I've held my entire life towards "business". Is   intermediation required for business and as such can be banished, or is business a definition for an entity that seeks to intermediate and as such is a universal (uhm constant? Truth?)?
My studies of history has shown that every time humans come up with some sort of technology or culture that encourages disintermediation, some business comes around and fucks it all up, there's a fight for its freedom that eventually is lost, until a new tech that comes around promising a golden age of disintermediation. Rinse....

It was mostly sarcasm, but they have little flash animations with it. Yeah its all your pictures and they probably use it  for some ulterior motive but it is at least original content

There's a dude that usually posts up outside this shop yelling for hours. He always looks like he just got off work but he just yells out, kinda at people kinda just...out. 
Also, step over? Jesus mate, maybe even a shred of compassion?

For exactly what the person raged about.
Old folk realize that they, like all children, mucked about most their life chasing selfish highs destroying the trees for not only them but the generations ahead. So they garden, because the next wave of youngings are fucking it up. They dont like to garden, par say, but they like things that grow and that will last beyond their life, and provide happiness when they will no longer be able to. Especailly when that end is so near.
