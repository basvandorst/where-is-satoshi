Whoa, that is pretty steep then. Don't remember fees like this the last time I bought from them, but it's been awhile. Sorry.  
  
If you buy with a credit card and payout to Paypal, that's almost 8% in fees. Wow.  
Guess that is the only way they can stay in business.
@_date: 2016-08-17 00:51:00
Surprised by the outrage.  
Hasn't anyone ever heard of credit card fees?   
FYI credit card companies charge merchants around 2% per transaction. $8.69 is less than 2% of $580.  
Usually the merchant pays for this since they are selling something that is already marked up.  
Try paying directly from your bank account.  
Would also apply if it's an instant buy.

A Satoshi should be called a bit.
Then, Gb, Mb, and kb.
1 BTC would be 100Mb.
@_date: 2014-05-03 16:37:54
The smallest unit should be 'bit'.  
Then everything in bit.  
Large amounts can be denoted as kb, Mb, Gb, etc.    
It's the easiest solution.  
A single denomination with amounts we are already familiar with. (kb, Mb, Gb)  
Bit can also be plural and singular, so no need to even say 'bits'.  
P.S. Use of the word bit as money predates its use to refer to binary digit.  
@_date: 2014-05-03 17:58:50
A lowercase b refers to bit, an upper case B refers to byte. e.g. Mb &amp; MB.    
**The smallest unit of all digital currencies should be called a bit**  because that is the most basic unit in the digital world. 
If that was standardized on, with the simple addition of kb, Mb, &amp; Gb, it would do away with the alternative of adding centi, milli, micro, nano, etc. to a myriad of specialized denominations.  
**All digital currencies should be [kb, Mb, Gb] + [Coin name].**  
If digital currency is to reach the masses, it should be as simple as possible.  
It's also easier to think of a whole quantities of a single unit than in fractions of a unit.
@_date: 2014-05-04 16:33:02
Notice the suggestion is standardized denominations for digital currencies and removing fractional units.

The general public will at most be concerned with how long a movie would take to download and not need to distinguish between Mb and MB.  
If a movie costs 1.25Mb in Bitcoin for example, it would be very difficult to confuse that with how many bytes the movie data file contains, which is an irrelevant statistic to consumers.  
There are going to be so many different digital currencies. If Mb and MB is confusing to the average person, how could they possibly figure out kether, mether, microbits, nanobits, etc. There will be hundreds of names just for denominations.  
Quadrillions of units are plenty for a single currency. There is no practical need for further division.

That's why Satoshis should be called bits, and you could say 31 bit, and use terminology similar to RAM (bit instead of bytes).
10b, 10kb, 100kb, 1Mb, etc. when referring to prices. One hundred mega bit, 100Mb = 1 BTC.
All for paying tribute to Satoshi, but a hundred mega bit rolls off the tongue a little easier than a hundred mega Satoshi.
Bit being plural makes it even simpler, bit instead of bits.

Probably, but they also know the long term potential and previous high of \~20k.

Why would you be against Ripple when you can buy BTC from within Ripple?

I also got a fake friend request in the last few days, but it's a common occurrence like getting spam email. There's no need to correlate that with anything else that happened during the same time period. Opening a new unfamiliar financial account like a Coinbase bitcoin account is unsettling, so there is heightened awareness in regards to potential dangers. But to think that within 60 seconds of opening an account, Coinbase sold his email which was then somehow associated with his FB account and a fake friend request sent is a bit ridiculous. Not a good business model. It's just coincidentally timed spam, ignore it. haha... for example it's Friday the 13th and I just happened to glance at the clock which says 9:11. Scary?. hehe.

The easiest method would be to call a satoshi a bit, and then just think in bit. 
   
One simple term 'bit' can be used for everything.  
  
The simplicity of thinking in bit:  
  
    ฿1 = 100,000,000 bit  
    
The complexity of thinking in the nomenclature of fractions of bitcoins, saying "satoshis", adjusting your thinking every time there is +10x:  
  
    ฿0.01 bitcent  
    ฿0.001 mBTC (millicoin)  
    ฿0.000001 μBTC (microcoin)  
    ฿0.00000001 satoshi  
@_date: 2013-11-02 14:33:34
To put it in perspective, imagine ordinary folk having to think in fractions like millicoin, .001 mBTC, microcoin .000001 μBTC and satoshis, or  .00000001,
and changing the frame of reference every time the value goes up by a factor of 10.

It's not a question of dishonoring or devaluing, it's about ease of use and adoption.  
  
Right now we think "how many dollars per bitcoin?"  
  
The simplest change is to think "how many bit per dollar?"    
  
It's 200kb per dollar when 1BTC = $500.    
It's 100kb per dollar when 1BTC = $1000.  
  
That one change solves the decimal problem and the sense of worth.  
  
So in a similar way to RAM, it's how many kb, Mb, Gb do you have or want?

1kb for $1 when 1 BTC = $100000   
  
  
333.3kb for $1 when 1 BTC = $300  
250kb for $1 when 1 BTC = $400  
200kb for $1 when 1 BTC = $500  
166.6kb for $1 when 1 BTC = $600  
142.8kb for $1 when 1 BTC = $700  
125kb for $1 when 1 BTC = $800    
250kb for $1 when 1 BTC = $900  
100kb for $1 when 1 BTC = $1000   
  
  
At the current price of $375 per BTC, you get 266.666kb per dollar.

It just seems counter intuitive to primarily think in fractions of a unit.
The masses I feel would prefer to use larger numbers to using fractions like hundredths or thousandths in ordinary transactions.
Also helps maximize the sense of value. 50 megabits for $100 or 0.5BTC?
@_date: 2013-11-02 15:40:27
The analogous part is the familiarity with using large numbers to quantify.
Bit would obviously use base 10 metric decimal bits, not binary bits.

@_date: 2013-11-23 14:51:00
Agree that bit is best as the singular and plural form.  
  
To make it easier, we should think in bit per dollar instead of dollars per bitcoin.  
  
And think of how many bit you have like RAM.  
  
100Mb (one hundred megabit) = 1 BTC.  
  
125kb per dollar when 1 BTC = $800.  
  
So if you have .1 BTC, you have 10Mb (ten megabit).

Possible if there is panic selling.
But it could also run away from the people waiting for the next big dip, who will get more and more anxious as the price climbs. Don't think many people were able to buy in on the last dip before it was back up to 120.
My opinion is that it will rise to 165-175 in the next two to three weeks mostly just due to the exposure.
And an even bigger rise when the next Euro country is sent to Supercuts.

The number of bit and the term bit, for both singular and plural, is the most simple.  
  
Using cent makes it confusing.  
  
Why hold on to old naming conventions and add reference to 1/100th of a dollar and the word dollar?

It doesn't need another name to establish a relative value.

If you look at the picture, from 120 to 124 it's rising and falling, but on average each new peak is a little big higher than the last. Whether or not each new drop is the beginning of a new downward trend or a small dip in longer upward trend is the mystery. Oh that and... there was a lot less resistance to upward movement (fewer asks) than 20x the amount of bids going down.

Doesn't that indicate upward trend? 20000 bids down to 112, but only 1000 asks up to 135?

Is this good enough for you? :) Drake cover.

Someone should edit the wikipedia entry then, because the term Satoshis is used in the first paragraph.

At 1 BTC = $800, a $1 can of Coca Cola would be 125kb (kilobit) in bit (satoshi).

The primary meaning of bit is "a small piece, part or quantity of something".  
  
Before bit was a binary unit, it was a monetary unit meaning 1/8 of a dollar.  
  
I think bit is the perfect term because it combines an archaic monetary association with a modern binary digital one. Hence the new definition as the decimal monetary bit.

What was their response to the message you sent them about the cancelled transaction?
@_date: 2013-05-02 18:10:04
Even better would be to switch to pricing everything in satoshis but call satoshis 'bit' instead.
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:28:37
A friend bought at 69 on the way up and the transaction completed.
Another friend bought on the way down in the 160's... it was cancelled as high risk. hehe

Small time traders aren't waiting for anything. There's a continuous sell the pump buy the dump cycle going on. There was just one while I was writing this message. :) 129 Sell! -&gt; 125 Buy!
Like you said, not a big enough market for big money. On the weekends 100-300 BTC can move the price up or down a point or more.
We need more people like Nick Colas. But on the other hand, the longer it takes for money bags to figure it out, the more time there will be for the average techno Joe to accumulate.
@_date: 2013-04-19 00:32:26
It's a better idea to just buy 300 - 600 coins now.

Bit is simpler.  
  
Simple is good. 
@_date: 2013-05-28 19:44:23
cap2002... agree.
But also call a satoshi a 'bit'.
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:49:00
Yes, they probably don't. But when it comes to trying to understand large numbers when referring to RAM thousands (kb) and millions (Mb) seems to have worked out well. The newer generation which this is most relevant to probably already has a good understanding due to phones, SD, and MicroSD cards.
@_date: 2013-06-09 18:50:48
  
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:33:36
Large numbers like 0.00193682 are better pronounced in a similar way to RAM:  
  
193.682kb (kilobit)  
  
1BTC = 1Mb (Megabit)
  
Why use mili, micros and satoshis, when it could all be in bit (satoshis).
@_date: 2013-11-01 20:48:34
The simplest is "bit" as an irregular plural instead of "bits" or "satoshi".
Totally agree about not using 'satoshi'.
1 BTC = 100,000,000 bit.
@ $200 per BTC, $1 = 500,000 bit.
@_date: 2013-05-04 04:58:52
Think in terms of the smallest unit.  
  
Solves a lot of problems. 
If we think relative to 1 bitcoin then it's always fractions of bitcoin, e.g. 0.001, 0.0006435, 0.000000435, btc, and all the other centi, milli, micro, nano, etc...  
  
It would be easier to just think in satoshi but change the name of the unit to 'bit'.  
  
Everything in bit.

Not mine, it's by "Zhou Tonged". Definitely captures the BTC mood... as long as the price keeps going up, unlike last weeks heart attack... lol.

Before they understood what email was, the post office at one point thought they would be able to make people buy stamps to send emails!

At least the dude is cool. :)
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:57:54
Ahh... that makes sense. Thanks for the explanation.  
  
Seems to strengthen the case for not using those intermediate units.  
  
IMO, in the long run using the smallest unit, calling it a bit instead of a satoshi, and thinking of money like RAM: bit, kilobit, Megabit, Gigabit (b, kb, Mb, Gb) is the simplest solution.  
@_date: 2013-04-23 01:39:21
Yeah every company should convert their stock into proprietary coinage.
But I can guarantee you that the 'Facecoin' version would not be a monopoly that damages Bitcoin, it would only promote it.
In the future there will be hundreds of different Bitcoin like stores of value.
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:18:44
Yeah I think bit sounds great too. A single syllable, irregular plural.  
   
When you standardize on the smallest unit, bit per dollar, it works at any exchange rate and removes the need to use the various other intermediate fractional units:   
     
Not sure what you mean by "groups of three".  
  
It's confusing because we are conditioned to think in BTC or price per BTC. If we thought it bit, then the true value of 1 BTC would be revealed.   
 
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:33:44
Or 450kb = $1
@_date: 2013-05-02 22:44:53
Why denote a bit as 1/100th of something?  
  
1 bit = the smallest unit.  
  
Think of everything in bit.  
  
100m bit = 1 bitcoin.  
  
That covers everything.  
  
@_date: 2013-11-02 14:56:52
Isn't the analogy of digital money storage to digital memory storage simpler than creating a new system?
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:37:00
It's better that we call Satoshis a bit.  
Think in bit.  
Not even bits.... just an irregular plural "bit" for both singular and plural.

I think the price will stagnate till Monday due to low volume. Hopefully people don't get nervous and stampede before then.
