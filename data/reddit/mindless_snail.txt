1913 isn't an arbitrary date, it was the year the Federal Reserve was created and the modern dollar was born.

Sure, but they can transfer their bitcoin to you without you having to touch the nasty butthole molecules on their assphone.

Nah, they're one of the most reliable guns out there. You can bury one in sand, dig it up a week later, and it'll fire right away. They can last for a long time without lubrication and you can clean one by just spraying the parts off with a hose.
Maybe you're thinking of accuracy instead of reliability? Because they're less accurate than an AR-15, especially if you treat it poorly, but it's more of a spray-and-pray gun than a precision sniper rifle.

Well, they were also one of the main reasons Satoshi disappeared.

This is a garbage ripoff chart of the original moon math guy. There's a much better version at 
The rainbow charts are from  but that hasn't been updated in a couple of years.

That's also a great way to end up poor. So you'll either be dead broke or rich, with the likelyhood on broke. Good luck dude.

It's more correct to say that you can lose more than you put into the trade. But you can't lose more than you have in your account.
But yeah, I wouldn't make a trade that could wipe out my entire account, that would be dumb.

I bought some BTC in 2014 and 2015 and the highest price I paid was about $600. I haven't sold a single one, but I did make 6 figures cashing out my BCH after the split. I got lucky selling it off near the peak.
It was easy for me to hold through the peak because I didn't need the money. I'm nearing the end of my career and getting ready to retire anyway, and while the BTC was a significant amount of money, it wasn't a life-changing amount of money. If I sold it all at the peak, my life wouldn't be much different now.
For people who are in a position where it is a life-changing amount of money, it's probably harder to hold on. If you can cash out some to pay off debt and improve your life, fucking go for it.
If you want to cash out to buy some crap you don't need, like a better car if your old car works fine, then you're probably just not good with money and have never been good with money. In that case you might as well cash out because you'll end up broke no matter what you do because of reckless spending habits.

Stories about this have been posted a bunch. It's a stretch to say "Whole Foods accepts Bitcoin". They let you pay with an app that lets you transfer Bitcoins into an account. They're a middleman that takes a cut.
Talk to me when I can pay with any Bitcoin wallet.

Real talk: you aren't ready for the "be your own bank" concept of bitcoin if you download the wrong app. Tons of people have lost their whole stack because they download the wrong app because of a misspelling or a phishing attack. You should REALLY be more careful about shit like this.

I remember when it happened in 2017. Nearly every post on the front page was a 9000 meme. Normally the mods would clean stuff like that up but they let it go that day to celebrate.

Just watch and you'll see how many people fall for scams. And how many people come close to falling for scams, because they have to ask if it's a scam.
In a lot of these scams the victim is boned because they authorized the bank transfer so the bank doesn't consider it fraud.
The very worst ones are the home down payment scams, where people get an email telling them to wire the down payment to the wrong bank account. People have lost their entire life savings - hundreds of thousands of dollars - by doing this. Most of the time the banks can't help, a wire transfer is just as permanent as a bitcoin transaction and they can't be reversed.

That's literally no different than selling BTC at Coinbase and paying with cash. It's not "accepting bitcoin" and it's not "paying with bitcoin". You are paying with cash, but the app is selling bitcoin that you transferred to its wallet.

Yeah we didn't even get a chance to enjoy the 9000s... until we passed it on the way back down :(
