Thanks for your answer. Thoughts on this - I don't think the limited number of potential bitcoins does anything to define its potential value however. It doesn't matter whether there is a limit of 200 coins or 200 million, their value is still based upon speculation and public sentiment. 
Thinking now, it would be interesting to calculate the estimated total cost of energy usage to mine all 21 million bitcoins, I wonder what the figure would be.

I disagree.
There's plenty of evidence suggesting pump and dump schemes, 'spoofing', 'painting the tape' and other forms of market manipulation are being executed by individuals or groups with large stores of cryptocurrencies on the biggest exchanges. These people are likely outside Western countries and outside traditional security regulation such as the S.E.C which is meant to prevent such behaviour occurring. The value of your holdings at the mercy of these 'bad' players.

You have just deduced how currency exchanges (of all kinds) work.

You are trading in an unregulated global securities market. There are bad players who can, have, and continue to manipulate the price for the benefit of their own profits. This is no secret. Have a look at the articles by 'Bitfinexed' on Hackernoon. I think you would be surpised at how large these manipulations are as well, with the order sizes in the thousands of bitcoin at a time. These kinds of moves have been illegal for decades yet are happening regularly in the unregulated global crypto market.
