This is just a blockchain test as a permissioned ledger, it has nothing to do with Bitcoin itself

What happened to you with Binance? Poloniex doesn't disclose any address, for all purposes it's the same as having the exchange in Hong Kong. Further, their terms of agreement includes mandatory arbitration, which means you have no rights to file a lawsuit. As above, use it with caution

Side chains are beneficial because they would add different and even more sophisticated functionalities to the Bitcoin ecosystem. As an example, think about Ethereum/Rootstock, where due to smart contracts you can have a decentralized prediction market where the payout is guaranteed by the blockchain itself. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum would benefit by a conduit provided by the sided chains: BTC by the Ethereum functionality and Ethereum from the popularity of Bitcoin. Although it doesn't mention side chains [this arcticle]( has good insights of how BTC can capture value from altcoins. In my opinion, more than being useful, side chains will be a true necessity for Bitcoin. Otherwise if Bitcoin stays isolated from any other system and a functionality provided by an altcoin turns out very popular and useful (e.g. Ethereum with prediction markets) in the long run it may dilute the value of BTC. The same can be said about scalability. As many other have said it, if bitcoin doesn't scale there will be a demand for an alternative.

Good for you. Many people were not as lucky as you are, and had their account frozen, lost their money with no explanation, just see the horror stories on the subreddits  /Poloniexforum /Poloniex

I wouldn't leave anything on an exchange... if only that exchange would let me withdraw my money! Poloniex has been keeping my assets against my will for more than a year, with no luck in getting them out. This is due entirely to their bad faith and negligence, it can't be any AML bullshit because at the same time I have unlimited withdrawing from Gemini and Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-05-02 11:38:22
Stay away from this exchange at all costs, even with zero fees.
1\) Zero customer support, if you have a problem even a serious one such as account hacked or frozen you may have to wait weeks or months to get a reply.
2\) If you are unfortunate to get flagged for suspicious activity by their crappy system your account may be frozen indefinitely, even if your transactions are 100&amp; legit
3\) Countless cases of people who have their assets frozen, or impossible to withdraw. Even when your reach their awful customer service after waiting for months they will find every excuse not to return your money. Alas I'm one of their victims

I advise you to read the nightmare stories on the PoloniexForum subreddit, I would stay away from that exchange unless absolutely necessary
@_date: 2016-03-08 04:25:20


You didn't get the point of the article: when the transaction volume increases no matter how high the fees there will be severe confirmation delays. And who cares if there is a conspiracy or not, or spam, or DdoS, or whatever. The point is: if the system has become so fragile there must be accountability of the code maintainers, and they have been incompetent in addressing the issue.


Further you disdain the temporary proposal of 2MB without giving an alternative.
Overall, this is the reply of a true troll, it's disheartening that it was upvoted to the top of the comments.

Guys, I think many here are misinterpreting the headlines. If you listen to the interview, what Vitalik said is within a specific context. The private blockchain would be to validate transactions internal to the consortium, the likelihood that they collude would be very small because it would undermine their system as a whole. In this sense a private blockchain with a small group of 10 banks would be decentralized. The public users in a larger network (e.g. the depositors) are not in the picture, so any comparison with Lehman Brothers is misplaced. On the other hand, even with a cryptocurrency with thousands of nodes a small group of miners holding the voting power could take decisions that are more beneficial to themselves than to the much larger group of public users.

This is just another reply that shows once again your lack of maturity and poor communication skills
@_date: 2016-03-16 11:56:57
for a "mature" discussion see for example the posts on this topic by Brian Armstrong, whether you agree with his opinions or not his analysis of the situation is formed logically and cogently.
The communication of is poor because he is dismissing the question without adding any salient information.

Every responsible exchange should have most of their funds in cold wallet, but every responsible exchange should also  ensure that their hot wallet doesn't go empty, to provide a decent service. By the way, do you know the address of their cold wallet? I only found this, [ which shows their funds as suddenly plummeting, did anything important happen which is kept secret from the public?

Nobody knows. That tells a lot about a supposedly "regulated" business, who is so shady that doesn't even disclose its address
@_date: 2018-10-26 23:52:42
I'm afraid your conclusion is not correct. The status "Pending" means that the confirmation email has already been sent and answered. Otherwise the status would be "Email sent"
@_date: 2018-10-27 00:06:27
That's their problem, they should have organized their systems better and this is a lesson for them for the next time. They make a ton of money from trading fees, and they must provide a decent service.
@_date: 2018-10-09 00:30:09
Haha. They are truly horrible, stay away like the plague 
@_date: 2018-10-16 19:29:16
The supposed regulation of Poloniex is a smokescreen. Under the pretext of following the rules they have frozen assets to countless people without warning, and contrary to what they had stated in the press releases. And the users don't have any legal recourse or can organize in a lawsuit because of the arbitration clause in their terms of agreement. 
@_date: 2018-10-17 13:43:27
No, you don't. You would understand if you had your own money stuck there, with no explanation whatsoever from the customer service. I'm a legit customer using Coinbase and Gemini and I can trade normally there
@_date: 2018-10-26 23:49:50
Delisting a coin should start first with trading, then there should be a much longer timeframe to allow for withdrawals. Poloniex can't be trusted on anything, just look at their statement last December: "all legacy accounts will be able to withdraw", and then they did the opposite and froze all of them... criminals!
@_date: 2018-10-16 19:24:34
The assets of many people are still kept hostages by Poloniex, who is preventing them to withdraw 
@_date: 2018-10-26 23:59:22
 No matter how you spin it, months of delay in answering a service request are unacceptable. Instead of blabbering excuses why don't you give back the money that you owe. Further, everyone knows that in crypto you don't need to provide any information beside posting a transaction, your request to sign the NDA is just a fig leaf to cover up your abusive behavior.
@_date: 2018-06-12 16:05:28
Well, some exchanges are deliberately a bait and switch scam from the inception. For example, two years ago Poloniex stated that without verification you can withdraw $2k per day, however, all of a sudden they blocked my account because I was using VPN, and then they forced me to verify. Still Poloniex last December stated in a press release about mandatory verification "**you will be given advance notice before this requirement goes into effect** ", instead they froze all the accounts without warning to lock in funds and prevent people to transfer their assets elsewhere. Now there are hundreds if not thousands of people with their funds frozen on that exchange. To me this is simply a dishonest trade practice.
@_date: 2018-06-25 14:55:25
 In this case Poloniex has been totally dishonest, they froze the accounts without advanced warning of a deadline, when in  their earlier press release they said the opposite. They did that  because they were afraid of losing funds from investors, who would have  moved their cryptos elsewhere if they were given a specific date.
@_date: 2018-06-25 14:56:57
As if they had a functioning customer service... see the horror stories on the web, people waiting for  months to get a reply
@_date: 2018-06-25 14:53:13
If you read the horror stories on the web they have always been horrible, their customer service was non-existent even before the acquisition.

but they choose selectively what to accept in the repository and who has access to it, it's the same thing as forcing a decision
@_date: 2015-08-25 08:06:36
They only cancel transactions when they are in your favor, they are highly dishonest. This would warrant a lawsuit, but terms in the user agreement prevents us to organize in a collective legal action and force us instead to go through a single arbitration process which is likely a joke. I wonder when the fraudulent actions of coinbase will attract scrutiny by the authorities

bram cohen doesn't seem to be connected with the real world, the idea that once BTC hits the size boundary a market for transactions will arise out of thin air and with no other consequences is purely delusional
@_date: 2016-02-10 18:36:51
You will be able to use any crypto currency for transactions done with Ethereum: this is what Vitalik means when he says that gas will be currency agnostic. So if you will be able to pay with Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ether etc that makes ethereum much more flexible and crypto currency friendly, Rootstock may be a redundant subset with a lot of other issues, such as mining centralization, necessity for a trusted party, non developed proof of concept etc. 
disclosure: I hold both some btc and some ether

Directly not, indirectly yes, in their vision to use bitcon as a settlement network. If you think for a moment that the old rules of returning capital with a profit don't apply to privately funded firms in the cryptocurrency sector you may be wrong.
@_date: 2016-02-06 14:37:40
Open source doesn't mean not controlled by a minority, and yes, some of the main LN developers like Paul Russell work for blockstream. 
The LN idea is good, but the timing of the roadmap and specific features implemented do not necessarily align with the general consensus. There is a potential conflict of interest: blockstream got &gt;$50 of funding from private investors, on one side it is good to have investment into blockchain research, on the other the cryptocurrency sector is like every other industry: **there will be the pressure to return that investment**

@_date: 2016-05-16 14:13:10
I agree that it will fork, however, it all depends on whether you consider a hard fork dangerous or not. If that is not dangerous (especially in my opinion when it is agree by the majority and planned carefully), than something should be done to adequate bitcoin to the demand for a higher transaction rate, at least while a more definitive solution is in place (LN is clearly not ready yet). On the other hand if the hard fork is dangerous the mining centralization is a problem that should be taken seriously. There are 4 miners who control 75% of the hash rate, if they hold the ultimate voting power to decide the direction of bitcoin for me this is a problem. We can't have the cake and eat it
@_date: 2016-05-19 20:07:24
If the role of the miners would be limited to creating blocks and validate transactions mining centralization wouldn't be a problem because, as Andreas points out, that status is transient. However, if the miners become the ultimate decision makers over which direction the digital currency should take then it's a total different story because their specific interest may not be aligned with other market participants, like the payment processors. So Andreas, I'm afraid, mining centralization is a big problem.
