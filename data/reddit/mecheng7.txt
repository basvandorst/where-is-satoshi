What did it give us, an effective increase to 1.6MB? I want more TXs, and right now, the easy way is a small increase in block size. LNs have been promised for how long now? I don't think BTC can wait any longer. A small block now isn't going to do a damm thing to centralization once LNs are established.
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:15:44
I get the feeling that they wanted to keep blocks small, so it would make people believe they need LNs, because of all the congestion small blocks would create. I think people would have realized they need them regardless of blocksize, and I feel the small blocks have hurt BTC, it's market dominance is dwindling. 
Disclaimer: This is all opinion, with no facts to back it up.

I want larger blocks and LNs, so I'm not welcome anywhere. :-(

How is that any different than BTC? What is it about BCH that allows that to happen, and not on BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:07:55
I get that, but witness data accounts for 2/3 of the block?
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:14:16
There aren't many post with substance here. Seems like most are just ATH memes or some rip on For example, this thread.

How does Segwit save that much space exactly? According to blockchain.info, the number of TXs has never crossed 2750 in the past year. How does Segwit cut the TX size into almost a third (8000/2750 = 2.9)?

Sooo, it's just like this sub?

This has been his exact response to others on this very thread, I don't think he has an answer.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:18:09
How is it centralized? Miners for BCH are the same people mining BTC.

Times change, maybe they did invest what they could lose, but in current times they have to take back some of that investment. This is a community for Bitcoin owners/users, they want to talk about their story, so let them. You don't have to read them. I'd rather see discussion on something like that than another ATH meme; we are all aware of the ATH. I don't read the "I'm out" post because I think they're silly as well, but I think it's nice to have a place people can vent.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:55:18
I'm in the same boat. My days here are numbered. I try to ignore all the BS, but it gets overwhelming sometimes. You're not alone. I try to stay for news and updates, but those posts are becoming increasingly rare.

There's a reason it's called a "free market", businesses are free to do what they want. People nowadays seems to think businesses are there to cater to their every demand. If it's in there best interest, they will, but they aren't required to.

I'm not sure how one can come to the conclusion it is a huge success with a number that small. I can understand being excited about it, but this might be a bit too early to claim. 
Edit: wrong pronoun
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:42:51


I keep seeing people say this, is this really the intent? I read the white papers and I didn't get that out of it (unless I accidentally skipped something). I feel like it's more along the lines of breaking free from the global financial system, rather that actively trying to cause turmoil. The way you put it makes it sound mischievous.
@_date: 2017-08-30 19:20:07
I know, I felt the same way about the topic that you did, so I was replying to you. Obviously the OP doesn't feel that way. I guess I should be said "OP" and not "you" in that comment. I was just typing in generalities.

(Finally, someone in this thread with knowledge)
Is Metcalfe's law really applicable when it comes to mining? When someones mining a block, are they really looking at how large a network is?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:51:39
What about Moore's law? Processing power will be able to handle blocks larger than 8MB when 8MB become full.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:00:17
I think you missed my point. All the additional users of Bitcoin will be just adding new TXs causing a huge mempool, and it's gonna lose a lot of people because wait times and fee will go to the Moon.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:11:06
Because it seems this subreddit has nothing else to talk about except shitting on BCH, and posting ATH memes.
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:55:38
Sounds like a riveting discussion topic.
Great minds discuss ideas, average minds discuss events, small minds discuss people.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:05:09
was around long before the fork of the two coins. Bitcoin cash wasn't a thing when that was created. The two had difference in ideas, which was inline with the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:01:41
You really waited two weeks to come back and say that? It was a joke.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:15:54
What is he doing thats defrauding and scamming people? Pretty sure he's buying BCH, not selling it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:04:17
I don't know if BTC can afford that much time. What happens when BTCs popularity blows up even more and sees more TXs coming thru because of the influx of new users? That mempool is gonna become quite large, and that's doesn't sit well with me.
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:20:33
We all know in about 2 weeks time this is going to fizzle out back down to around $3400. Which at that time we all will buy more, and the ones that don't will complain they should've bought more. One or two people will complain they went all in at $5900, and then it'll rise back up and break $6k before we know it. Rinse and repeat. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 17:51:19
I'm still unsure why we need to keep blocks small. What's the reasoning behind this?
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:45:20
Isn't BCH closer to the original Bitcoin than BTC tho? So BTC would be the photo copy.
@_date: 2017-10-17 17:26:14
How so?
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:40:40
I understand that. BCH isn't censorship resistant? And how is it centralized? This is news to me, that's why I'm asking.
@_date: 2018-02-25 14:25:30
If this site is correct, the outputs per transactions have been, on average, declining for 2018.
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:51:57
I guess I need to pay attention more. What exactly have they done that made them lose you're trust?
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:01:55
I prefer to hodl/spend. Timing the short term market was never something I was big into.
@_date: 2017-06-28 20:54:12
Does he get a penalty for skipping part of the track?
