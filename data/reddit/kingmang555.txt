What the fuck do you consider middle class then?  
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:32:17


Yeah, it certainly would be natural.  Especially if the reserves don't exist.
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:33:31
true, corrected my post
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:53:40
Amazing that nobody wanted to hear it and was blinded by dollar signs is what you mean

The fact that the company has been promising and audit for months now and has yet to deliver it certainly isn't good.  Did you even read that they bailed on their most recent audit because the auditor was being "too thorough"?  Red flags everywhere.   There have been people talking about this scam for quite a while now, so you would think it would be bitfinex's best interest to clear the air around this whole thing. Do you know a SINGLE person that is possession of even 1 USDT?  I don't.  Yet over a billion of them were apparently sold over the past couple months.    
  
  
I have 3 billion USD in the bank.  I'm not going to offer you any proof, but you should believe me because I said so. Thats essentially what bitfinex is saying.

The average person is thousands in debt.  I would say plenty of people would classify 500k in total assets to be rich

It is almost unfathomable how oblivious people are around here.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:21:10


Not sure if you are trolling or just that fucking oblivious

If burger king was slow, overtaxed (fees), and made burgers that were just for looking at and not eating, then yes I would say this is an accurate anaology

Thats like me blaming chevy when I buy their truck and drive it into a wall.
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:17:59
That's not what its like... not at all.  Overstock incorrectly implemented the API.

Since the november 1st BTC is up about 125% and BCH is up about 500%
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:25:50
There is a difference between a fractional reserve and creating your own fucking currency that you "print" out of thin air.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:56:54
It is when you know that you are absolutely fucked.  Might as well try to profit as much as possible while you can
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:33:03
So in order to be considered middle class, you need to be an employer?  What are you basing YOUR definition of middle class on other than your own personal opinion?  I'm pretty sure there are a whole lot of people in this country who aren't employers and would fall into most peoples definition of "middle class"
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:12:33
What?  How did you come to this conclusion?  Have you been actually following this story at all over the past couple of months?  
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:51:33
You could probably make 40-50k a year simply by investing it all. I would probably still work, but if you were smart with investments and lived frugally you could get by.


that is a ridiculous statement
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:00:51
I'm not trying to cherry pick a time frame (you did that) to show that one was doing better than the other, I was simply pointing out that your previous statement was incorrect.
Also, you new statement is also incorrect.  Since Jan 1st BCH is up about 7% to BTC 4.5%  (this is using the data available on coinmarketcap)
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:25:03
If news comes out actually confirming this all, the crash has just begun my friend
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:10:21


You clearly have no fucking clue how much market manipulation you can do with that kind of money.  You literally drive the price up and down as you please.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:11:22
Market manipulation.
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:28:36
The median household income in the USA is like 60k to put things into perspective.  Plenty of people would consider you to be rich, and plenty would not.  I think you are clearly above "middle class" if your household income is 250k.  Claiming to be "firmly middle class" an then following that up with saying you wouldn't get out of bed in the morning for a 100k salary is a bit laughable.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:00:22
When you steal somebody elses money, people tend to notice quickly.   
 What happens when they make off with 100 million BTC and people try to withdraw?  Why do that when you can print tether out of thin air and make "legitimate" purchases?
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:09:10
Thats because 95% of the people here have an understanding of this market that simplifies down to "HODL LOL $$$$$$"
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:36:29
and the fact that you take their word as truth without any sort of proof is your own fault. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:31:34
company has been sketchy as fuck from the get go and I've been convinced for a while now that they are going to crash and burn on this tether thing.
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:10:22
Then it was coded wrong in the first place if it allowed this to happen.  Pointing the finger at anybody other than overstock is ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:53:38
People usually pay for those homes over the course of 30 years though.  I would say if you had enough money to potentially by one in cash you are way better off than most.  Obviously people have different definitions of "rich".  The average american household carries 137k in debt and makes about 60k a year so somebody with 500k is certainly WAY better off than most.

Over 1 trillion in volume over the last 24 hours.  Get over the pump and dump claims already

A level headed and unbiased overview of both coins?  That's a rare find nowadays.  Bravo sir
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:40:00
as somebody who frequents both subs I assure there there is tons of animosity on both sides, and I personally find it ridiculous.  The only reason you see more of it on the other sub is because it isn't spammed with 60 new meme posts a minute.  If anything this sub is a lot more malicious toward BCH (the bitcoin.com wallet review brigade for example) than BTC is toward bitcoin.  
  
It is my opinion that both coins are being heavily controlled by people with deep pockets who are looking to benefit themselves and not the actual bitcoin project.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:46:39
Do you think he was incorrect in what he stated about both sides viewpoints?  What was inaccurate about what he said?
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:46:18
Maybe you SHOULD keep an open mind.  People on both sides will lead you to believe the other is evil and psychotic.  Read up on the differences and decide for yourself which you like and want to support.  Contrary to what some people might want you to believe, you can indeed support BOTH sides.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:25:17
I never said anything about a switch.

Maybe not, but he has made various pro BCH tweets in the past

The price didn't drop from 20k to 8.5k because of ban FUD.
