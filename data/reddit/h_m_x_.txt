But at this exponential growth rate (I don't actually know how the power growth looks like but I assume it somewhat proportional to hashpower), the question is only when it will surpass such goalposts...

I've had the numbers and the letters as well, also knew that the "lowercase L" should either be a 1 or I \(the most probable mistake\). 
But it did not occur to me that the last QDF should be capitals and that I should just brute\-force all possible/allowed case switches.
Thanks anyway!
In the process I've learned:
\- how bitcoin keys are generated
\- how they are encoded in base58 \(version \+ exponent \+ compressed flag \+ checksum\)
\- how the public address is calculated
\- that this is actually a P2SH addres, since it begins with 3
\- which python libraries to use
All in all, a win\-win.

I don't think this will happen anytime soon yet.
 Some facts I think are relevant:
- recent history shows forking is often profitable for the initiators, so there is incentive. 
- ego, developers want to leave a lasting personal mark (just look at the number of various linux distros, but here its worse due to the monetary incentive factor)
- ideological issues, e.g. ASIC resistance or not.

My approximation was:

If this scarcity-based model is more accurate, it predicts even faster rise of price than the typical logarithmic chart we usually see, e.g. 
That is because the S/F ratio will increase exponentially with time, not as a power law.

Nice analysis! 
But is missing the point. 
This is what happens when you give someone with (only a) strong statistical background the opportunity to analyze a model. It is a toy model, an approximation. The claim is that it captures some of the underlying mechanisms. The original author is never claiming to be able to predict the fine structure caused by the collective behavior.
To put it simply, of course one would expect auto-correlation, of course one would expect  heteroskedasticity . 
This doesn't invalidate the model, nor can it decide on potential validity of assumptions or such. Also a good fit does not confirm a model. Statisticians have issues with that. But if you're from a more scientific background, especially physics, using models to approximate nature is far from black and white. Instead, it is a path towards gaining more knowledge and understanding.

I just updated the plot with the last 10 months of data (same URL link as above), prediction still holds true.
@_date: 2019-02-11 22:32:28
I m grateful for your response.
But let me continue your reasoning a bit further.
If the value of Bitcoin will continue to rise, unless the cost of electricity will rise accordingly, more people will mine and the power consumption will rise. If the cost of electricity will rise proportionally to the value of bitcoin, this will be really bad for economy for obvious reasons. On the other hand, if the value of BTC rises faster than the cost of electricity, then energy consumption will increase.
So from my simplistic reasoning: increase in BTC value (relative to cost of electricity) =&gt; increase of energy consumption (assuming we dont get caught in the rising energy cost scenario).
More efficient minig will not really help here, it wil only increase the difficulty, and any energy savings are only transient.
Can anyone see a major gap in the above? I would love to learn. Thanks!

Hi, nice analysis!
I'm not so sure I understand your conclusions from the last plot. From that plot it seems that a spike in BTC price precedes the increased rate of news (I'm looking at the 2013-2015 time frame specifically).
I performed a cross-correlation study of the total crypto market cap vs. the Google Trends search. Due to such a huge range of values I did the analysis in log scale for both. What the Fourier transform of the cross-correlation function indicates is that the causality actually goes both ways in 2017. 
However, there is slightly but significantly more causality in the Google search -&gt; total market cap direction. I find this very fascinating, but obviously such a description is  too simplified. 
However, I don't think we have enough data at the moment to build a true dynamic model of all the elements.

Basically by first plotting the cos sum as a function of a from -2pi to 2pi, and then overlaying horizontal lines for various zeta(b) to see for which b values there are intersections. Then I just numerically  solved for the intersections for a. The last ste was to calculate the sin sum to required precision. I had to iterate a bit the process, refine a, then refine the sin sum. When the results stoped changing I converted the integer solutions to the sin sum to compresses and uncompressed WIF private keys, and swept them.

I solved  just a while ago, but was not the first. I see now the BTC was moved from  a few hours ago, before I even started solving it (didn't bother to check...).

This is definitely on my to-do list. I'll try to isolate every relevant past bubble to see if the model is any good.

I welcome any suggestions for improvement!

You are right, the simplifications I've made are very crude. 
But sometimes the big picture is the only thing that matters. I'm just exploring if this is relevant in this case, that's all.
I'm sure you personally know many people who were oblivious to crypto until having recently invested at an ATH and are now selling for loss. It's this population that the model is aiming to describe.
As I said, I don't take the results seriously, but I am seriously considering the validity of the model in *some* settings.

Hi, when you solve the puzzle you get the private key. That is *literally* the **key** to everything. From it you can derive your public key and your address(es). With you private key you can sign the transaction, proving you have the key. This is all the rules care about: proving ownership/possession of the private key.
If you are so inclined, you can find [here the actual code]( I've used to brute-force the private key as I was not sure of all the characters, especially the numbers. Within the code you can also see how the key and the P2SH addresses is encoded.

It does work, but we just moved the problem a little bit into the future. That's always the problem with exponential growth and limited system.
For example, if you remember the old "lotus pond" question: "*A lotus flower fills a pond in 30 days. It doubles in area  every day. In how many days will two such flowers fill the pond?"* and it's follow-up version: "*After the pond is filled, how long does it take to fill two ponds?"*.  The answer is of course just one more day...
Think about it in this setting ;-)
