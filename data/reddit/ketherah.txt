What is the exact fee to buy and send?
Right now it looks like their price is about 10% higher than Coinbase.
I'll stick with zero fees, and a fair market value with coinbase, but if y'all want to make a statement and overpay go ahead.

You are wise to not trust any market. You need to hold your own private keys, or you don't really own your coin. You do need to use markets to purchase and sell though.
You can buy on coinbase then transfer to your own wallet. Using gdax you can buy and transfer with no fees at all (at the expense of time). Right now the best advice is probably to buy a hardware wallet, but I think a paper wallet can be secure too. Just generate your key offline.

Something he doesn't show is to move funds or coin from Coinbase, all you have to do is login to GDAX, click Deposit, then choose your Coinbase wallet as the source. You can also deposit USD directly to GDAX, so after you are set up there is no reason to go back to Coinbase.

record the current price, hide the ticker, a person has to guess if it went up or down, if they are wrong, they drink. Hand the ticker to the next person.
